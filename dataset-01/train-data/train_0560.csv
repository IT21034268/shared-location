1,PIECE OF JUNK AFTER 18 MONTHS,"Purchased this from Amazon for $174.99 on August 2, 2010. I used for a couple months in my basement only, stored, used in 2011 during summer only, and stored. Note, I only use when my basement starts smelling a bit damp, not continuous.It's June 22 of 2012, I just got out for the year, and the dehumidifing part of the unit simply does not work, and the unit gets very hot. I called the company, and they said 'oh, looks like you got a defective unit, but it's too bad, it's only a 1 year warranty"".Literally, I'm out of $174.99. I wouldn't recommend a Soleus product for the world."
2,Good while it lasted,"This dehumidifier is very quiet and effective at removing water. The humidity level settings (45%, 55%, 65% or continuous operation) are sufficient but I would have liked greater control. If the power goes out the unit will not restart when power is restored; you have to manually do that.Unfortunately, the compressor died on my unit after only three summers of use. When I turned it on this year the fan came on but the compressor never kicked in, so even after 24 hours of operation it didn't collect any water. I called Soleus but they said the product is out of warranty (one year warranty). In order to get it fixed I would have to pay for shipping both ways plus parts plus labor. So, I'm in the market for another unit. Having paid $200 for a unit that only lasted three summers you can bet this new one will not be a Soleus, which is too bad because I really liked this dehumidifier."
1,"Only works for about 90 days, then dies",We bought this unit in July and it only worked for about 90 days. The fan motor continues to run but the unit is complete dry - it's not pulling ANY moisture from the air - even after a week. I read other reviews before buying this one that said the unit dies after a few months - I should have listened. The unit did work well and run quietly but that's not worth much when the product life is only about 90 days. That's a pretty expensive appliance if it only lasts 90 days. We'll be returning our dead de-humidifier and buying a different brand.
2,Was great but now wont shut off,This worked GREAT but then we have had TWO floods in our house. We come home and the room is filled with water because the float did not trigger the off switch! Company said we were not in warranty so now looking for another or a way we could fix this one :(
1,Did not last long,I had this unit for a little over one year. The refrigerant coil started leaking just after the warranty ran out. Had to junk it. Would not recommend.
2,Didn't Last Long,"Only had it for a couple of summer. Started out great, but wasn't doing much into the second summer. The amount of water it was pulling out of the air diminished and then after a point just put out a bad smell. Too bad since it was very quiet."
2,"A very quiet workhorse, but only lasted 2 years","I decided on this brand and model because of its reputation for quiet operation. It lived up to that, never bothering me while I worked in my basement office. It made a quiet, almost peaceful white noise in the background of my day. I was startled at how much water it pulled, but like many of these units, its life was far too short. I'd hope for 5 years for a $200 dehumidifier, but alas, this brand has trouble making it that far. I've gone with a Frigidaire for the replacement. We'll see how that compares."
1,Premature Failure Poor Customer Support,I purchased the Soleus and it quit drawing water from the air in the first 6 mos. The Soleus service rep chuckled as she advised me to just buy a new one since shipping and minimum service charges would be substantial [...] bucks plus when you throw in the parts - like how else can you fix it - without parts? I since bought a Frigidaire with a five year warranty on the sealed system and it works fine - albeit a bit noisy vs Soleus. I hauled the Soleus to the dump and promptly threw it in the junk appliance area where it belongs.
1,Does not reduce Relative Humidity to 50%,we need a dehumidifier to operate in low temperatures and bring the Relative Humidity to 50% (which is what is recommended to stop mold and mildew). It has been running on high for several days in an approx 10 x 12 room in the basement and has only brought the humidity down to 60%. Anyone else have this problem? Any suggestions on improving performance? All the negative reviews about service makes me hope I can make it work for us!
1,Terrible reliability 22 month and died,Removes water from the air very good. The problem is it died after just 22 months. Sad part is we dont use it in the winter time which through 2 seasons accounts for 12 months of the 22. Seems hard to find any dehumifier that will last at all.
1,Unit failed after about 300 hours of use,"I purchased this item, based on positive online recommendations, a little less than 3 years ago. We used it sparingly, probably a total of around 300 hours. Last week when I turned it on, only the fan operated; the compressor no longer worked, so there was no dehumidification. An email to soleus brought the following response:""Dear Customer,>>Unfortunately, there isn't anything I can tell you that will fix this unit. The only thing you can do is take it to a certified AC technician. It sounds like the compressor has given out.""This unit is attractive, seems to be nicely designed, and ran quietly; but I think it is appalling that such an item should fail so quickly and that Soleus should take no responsibility for the failure."
1,DEAD after 1yr - 2nd unit DIED after 2 yrs - AVOID!,"In early 2008 I purchased the Soleus unit after doing extensive research online. Everyone seemed to be praising the unit for it's quiet operation. Once I got the unit and set it up it was very quiet. But after the first season it refused to generate any condensate at the start of the second season. I was just in the 1 yr warranty period and contacted the company who did replace the unit. The replacement unit ran for two seasons, but now at the beginning of what would have been the third season, it refuses to generate any condensate - even in ""continuous"" mode. So now it is really quiet as I have pulled the plug and am back looking for a reliable product. My sincere advice is STAY AWAY FROM SOLEUS."
2,Ours lasted two years as well - seems like a refund is in order,"This product worked very well for two years. It is very quiet and was run continuously. We purchased two of these - one died at exactly two years and one month and the other is still working. Given how many people are reporting the same problem, the manufacturer and/or Amazon should consider at least a partial refund for this product."
2,Not reliable,"I have 2 of these Soleus units. They were great while they worked, but both stopped working after a little more than a year, within a couple months of each other.There is no reasonable repair option, either."
1,Too Good to be True,"I purchased my Soleus Air 40 pint dehumidifier after reading the glowing reviews about it. The unit ran no more than 8 hours then completely stopped working. It is currently enroute for a refund. It really is quiet, since it does not run at all."
4,Recommendation (plus a question),"I got this dehumifier a few days ago, my first, and am pretty pleased with it. The unit pulls a surprising amount of water from the air in a short amount of time (3-4 cups in 30 minutes), and makes just the right amount of noise (not much. nice quiet noise). It arrived quickly, in good shape, and was out of the box and working in about 5 minutes. Super easy.My question: Is it supposed to be a heater, too? I'm surprised/disappointed that it sends hot dry air into the room (way better that hot wet air, but still). There's no control setting for temp, so I guess it's just going to do that. Do they all? Is it a function of heat generated by the work the motor is doing or of the qualities of the air as water is pulled from it?If the first, I'll probably keep trying to find one that is like this in every way, but doesn't coincidentally funtion as a heater. If the latter, I'll enjoy my hot (but dry!) house."
2,Our old Kenmore works better than this!,"We have a super old Kenmore dehumidifyer that is years old. It's like a Mac truck and is bulky and loud...but it works like a charm. The reason I wanted a new one is it's hard to watch TV because it is so noisy.The new Soleus just doesn't do the same job at removing moisture from the basement. It's been assigned to the back room, and the bulky Kenmore is once again in the TV room. The Soleus is just not worth the money."
2,Unreliable,"Bought 2 of these, they both stopped working within a few months of each other after just over a year. There is essenitally no repair option, except to pay shipping both ways to the manufacturer and $45/hr labor plus parts."
3,Only 3 Humidity Level Presets 50% - 60% - 70% (Needs 40%),"Machine is quiet and does the job it was intended to do. I could have really loved this unit. However, it has only three humidity presets 70%-60%-50%. Being experienced in mold remediation and having mold allergies myself I can tell you that the target humidity should be 40%. My last unit which recently died allowed me to adjust the hemastat in 5% increments from 30%-70%. The 40% humidity also is helpful if you have arthritis (which I do). I worked in the Custom Home Building business for years and also managed rental properties and Mold 101 is to reduce mold growth, humidity should not be over 40%. Forget half of what you read on the Internet, I was certified in Mold Remediation so this 50% isn't correct. Some websites say 30-50% but the truth is 30%-45% is max. With no higher than 40% being the target."
1,"Do not buy, never great, broke after two years","Bought this dehumidifer in 5/06 after reading reviews and tired of replacing the metal-box units sold at Wal-Mart and hhGregg. Was impressed at how quiet it ran and ease of connecting hose output to sump. But never dried the basement as well as prior units. Sometime in summer 2008 (not sure when) it stopped collecting water (didn't realize it wasn't working because the fan and compressor seemed to be running). Owner's manual says to check input and output ports for blockage, but the plastic case is held together by four non-standard screws, so I can't get the thing apart to clean it. Soleus web site offers support only for those in warranty (1 year), I sent them an email but do not expect results."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Like all of you I read the reviews to help make my decision. I read the two negative reviews about it breaking in 2 months against all the positive reviews. So I decided to take a chance. Yeah, well, 2 months later it broke. It's no longer pulling any water from the air. Now I have to begin the long process of trying to have Soleus replace it. Again looking at what the 2 negative reviewers had to say about that, I don't hold out much hope. So 200.00 bucks for 2 months, doesn't seem like much of a bargain. Needless to say I wouldn't buy a Soleus product again. And if my review steers someone else from buying this shody product, it was worth the time it took to write."
1,"Works, but for only six months","This worked well at pulling water from the air in my very humid coastal Florida master bathroom. But it failed just six months later. After reading these reviews, it looks as if I'm not the only one."
1,"Does not work after 3 months, returned next one lasted 2 months",Do not buy this product. I bought it new one year ago. It worked for 3 months. I spent $25 to return it and they replaced it. The new one lasted 2 months. I will not send this one back because I need a dehumidifier that works.
1,Dead after one year,The dehumidifier stopped working after one year and 15 days when it was out of warranty. They are not build to last.
3,Satisfied Customer,"I recently purchased the Soleus Air CFM-40 E 40-Pint Dehumidifier with Humidistat from Amazon. After one week of use here is my initial review comments. Overall I am satisfied with the Dehumidifier, it does its job of keeping my basement dry. The installation was quick, I didn't have any difficulty in getting the Dehumidifier up and running. And I have been emptying out bucket of water every couple of days.What I don't like, is to run into continuous drain mode, I have to connect a pipe of 15 mm internal diameter. I have tried in Home Depot and couldn't find the pipe. I had hoped they would have packaged at 5 dollar pipe with this expensive Dehumidifier, which would have avoided the trips to Home Depot. Most of us would benefit from that."
2,Stopped working after 6 months of use,It was great while it worked.... quiet and efficient. after one summer's use (appx 6 months) we put the unit away and pulled it out again to find that it wasn't drawing any water out from the air. called customer service and they stated it is a compressor problem and that i need to find a repair person on my own to have it fixed since it was past the one year warranty. the repair person suggested we junk the unit and buy something else with an extended warranty. very disappointed with the unit and their customer service.
2,Worked well while it lasted...which wasn't very long.,I've owned 3 of these. The first one work well so I bought another one for another area of the house. I bought the second one in Winterand didn't use it until Spring when I realized it didn't work at all. I called Soleus and they said I'd have to pay to send it to them since I had it over 30 days. It was about $40 to ship it and they sent me a new one.The third one worked well also for about 1 1/2 years and then stopped working...about the same time my first one stopped working. So I got about 3 years out of the first one and a year and a half out of the last one. Maybe this is a normal lifespan for a dehumidifier but I don't find it acceptable and won't be buying another Soleus.
1,Good for a year or 2 but that's it,"My Soleus is less than 2 years old. The compressor locked up when I turned it on a couple days ago. Basically, that means it's totaled. Searching the web, I find this has happened to many people. They last for a year, 2 or 3 and then they lock up. The one year warrenty is no help. They're a great unit when they work, but my old GE costs a lot less and lasted 2x as long. I'm looking for new one but won't be considering a Soleus"
3,Dehumidifier Soleus Air CFM-40 E,"The Soleus Air dehumidifier is extremely quiet; however, the amount of moisture pulled from the air is not nearly the amount the previous very noisy models traditionally found in Sears/Lowes/HomeDepot.After getting it set up and running for a week, I noted in the Users Manual that the rated capacity is at 80 degrees and goes down as the temp goes down - so if your basement is much cooler, that capacity goes down."
1,soleus air stopped working after a couple of months,"It stopped working after a couple of months. Tried turning it on and off, plugging it in and out... occasionally these ""restarts"" worked but then they stopped working all together. The unit was over $200 and just worked a few months."
2,Great while it lasted,"My first Soleus dehumidifier worked fine for nine months, then stopped working. The motor ran, but it no longer pulled any water out of the air. Since it was still under warranty, I got another one at no cost. The second one worked fine for eight months, then stopped working. Same problem: motor runs, but doesn't dehumidify.Since the one-year warranty is now up, I'll have to buy a new dehumidifier. I'm not really convinced that getting a third Soleus is worth the money. Call me old fashioned, but I expect my appliances to last for more than a year or two -- and certainly for more than a few months."
5,Works when it works - then it dies - avoid,"My initial review is below. It does work great, as long as it works. I have purchased three units. The first two I ordered, one died just after the warranty expired (one year +); and the second died after 18 months. Shortly after the first died, I ordered the third unit. It worked quite well for just barely over one year; then it died.My initial short-term enthusiasm is long gone. Avoid this product. Functionality barely outlives the warranty priodSoleus Air CFM-40 E 40-Pint Dehumidifier with HumidistatEffective in controlling humidity in approximately 2500 sq. ft. area (shop and garage) to 40 - 41% when set on ""dry"" and ""quiet.""A previous reviewer complained about difficulty in configuring a drainage. I was successful in using 1/2"" poly supply tubing designed for use with a drip irrigation system. The 1/2"" tubing fits perfectly over the nipple. The combination of elbows and nipples makes the drainage system almost infinitely configurable."
4,"Very quiet, works well","Very easy to get it going, just plug it in. Very quiet, wasn't sure it was even on half the time. It traps alot of water, it's important to keep the rear air filter very clean, otherwise the fan gets a bit hot. If it's clean then it's only slightly warm. It's just a bit heavier than I would prefer but maybe these things are all kind of heavy (or I am just getting old, more likely). Recommended. Really works."
2,So far no problems,"The unit bought through Amazon is working fine so far; however, a previous one bought through another web site broke in less than a year. Getting in touch with customer service was a piece of work, and having to send the unit back to California without being reimbursed for shipping cost, it is quite disappointing. Lesson learned from this: buy the dehumidifier from a local store, because what is saved at the beginning it will be spent when having to ship the unit back to the company's service location."
1,"Quiet, but not efficient and not made well","I bought this unit because all the reviewers marveled about how quiet it is. I suppose quiet is what you get when the device doesn't do much. It hardly removed any water and has cheap, flimsy construction. I returned this unit after a week. I also bought and strongly recommend the Frigidaire 50 pint unit. It's louder but removes 5 times the water."
1,DO NOT BUY,"unit worked great until 2-3 months after warrantee expired, then complete failure Now I have a Soleus CFM-40 doorstop. Customer serviceinformed me that they are not built to be repaired, and were completely unhelpful- but did suggest I buy another one . I have never written a review ofanything before this one - beware this unit."
1,Quit after less than 3 years; Would not buy again.,"The compressor got noisy over a period of 2-3 weeks, then the unit stopped collecting moisture. Less than 3 years is a pretty short life span, especially when I didn't run the unit in the winter! When I called customer service, they advised me to look for a repair service, but said the cost of repair would probably exceed the cost of a new dehumidifier."
3,When it works it works great!,"Needed a dehumidifier for my home theater in my basement. This one was attractive since it has a whisper quiet mode. Nothing but good things to say about the performance with one exception: The first one quit working a little over a month after purchase. The replacement arrived quickly and has been working fine although I have just gone beyond the time period during which the first one broke down. So, with concerns over how long the product will work I have to say, when it's working is does the job very nicely."
3,The solias dehumidifier,when we recieved the product we had to return it. So I rated this a 3 because why didn't work the first time. We had to return it. This was a hassel. But I have to agree it is quiet and effient now.
1,busted within 10 days,"The unit stopped working completely within about 10 days. Sent back immediately to Amazon, they paid shipping. This was the 2nd crappy dehumidifier I bought via amazon in a month. I ended up going elsewhere, and bought this:[...]Boy, it was nice to talk with a real (and nice!) person on the phone to place my order. And, it's one sweet little unit."
1,As others said product does not last,Purchased Soleus 40 pint dehumidifier in late October 2007. Started using it in summer of 2008 & the summer of 2009 & 2010. Five months use each year for a total of 15 months and now the condenser will not kick in. When it ran it did its job but $200 cost for 15 months use is what I consider a rip off.
2,"A Failure, don't waste your money","Bought this one year ago 11/09, ran it 24/7 in my studio, worked well for a year and than it just stopped working. More junk from China"
2,died after 18 months,"lasted 18 months in a finished basement in the northeast. worked fine, then suddenly died -- unfortunate and surprising given it was so highly rated."
2,broke after fifteen months - no support,"This unit worked very well for approximately fifteen months. I was pleased with the quality and value. Then the compressor stopped functioning. I called technical support. They said they would do nothing outside of the one year warranty, which is fair enough I suppose. The thing that got me is that it sounded like the customer service representative fielded many of these calls every day. The attitude seems to be if it is out of warranty, you are out of luck and we don't really care, but at least we don't care politely. Even pretending to have a modicum of sympathy or concern would have been nice. I shall never purchase a Soleus again."
2,"Ok, but died after 2 years","This unit worked well for three years EDIT: (3 seasons of use, just over 2 years of actual operation) //EDIT and then decided to quit. I would think that it would last longer, especially since it replaced one that was 10 years old. Good thing I did not get rid of the old one (it's a big ole 2.5 foot cube and quite hefty), it's back in service.While it was working, I liked this unit. Small and relatively quiet. I just expected more longevity out of it.EDIT: After replying to a comment and thinking about it, actual run time for this unit was only about 12 months since I only use it during the summer months. I have downgraded my rating from 3 to 2 stars."
2,"Ran ok for 2 years, then died","This unit was quiet and seemed to work well for about 2 years (Sept 2007 thru the summer of 2009); after that the fan ran all the time but the hose and bucket were bone dry.Pros: quiet enough to use in living space, able to attach hose to drain or pump, did make the basement of my 900 sq ft home drier.Cons: fan always seemed to be on so I suspect the humidistat wasn't doing its job, did not auto-restart after power outages, only worked for 2 years.Based on my experience and other reviews, I will not buy this brand again. I am using it in a basement, so quiet isn't as important to me as durability. I will look for something with a 3 or 5 year warranty on the sealed parts/condenser."
1,Lousy product concealed by pretty packaging,"Soleus gets one solid star and kudos from me for one thing: doing a nice job of concealing a lousy product with neat, expensive looking packaging. I owned this model for exactly 15 months, during which it worked without a hitch, then suddenly it died. The motor still runs, but there is no moisture collecting in the bin. The unit was never abused, since it was only kept in the basement of my house and turned on only during the humid months of the year (March through September). I called Soleus Service Line three separate times, and they all said that there was nothing they could do since my 1-year warranty had expired. No manufacturer rebate on the next product purchase. No tips on DYI repair. They offered nothing. Bottom line: Soleus is perfect for you if you are willing to pay almost $200 for 15 months of dehumidifier action."
2,Worked great for less than two years,I bought this dehumidifier less than two years ago. It worked great for the first year and was quiet by comparison to other dehumidifiers. It started not pulling water from the air (I live in the rain forest in Alaska) last winter - I had always cleaned the air filter and there was no other maintenance to be done as the unit is closed. I removed it this spring when our rains started and the house humidy shot up. I would not recommend for the price.
1,Failed,"Worked great for a year. Then left off till next summer--fan only, no cooling action. Switching to Frigidaire."
1,Soleus Air CFM-40 dehumidifier,"This is my second one of this item. As with many people, they work great...until they don't. First one stopped working and leaked on the floor after about one year. The second one after about 3 months of light work. They are so much quieter than anything else on the market, that I got sucked in a second time. Never again. I have a noisy frigidare that has worked great for a couple years. I guess I will put up with the noise over the Soleus garbage. This should really rate a minus three stars."
1,STAY AWAY!!!,"Purchased, as did other people, based on the positive reviews. Unit, from new, has only worked on the high setting. STAY AWAY FROM SOLEUS!"
5,Excellent Product,"This is the first dehumidifer I purchased. I love it and would definitely recommend it. It pulls the moisture out of the air quickly. It is very, very quiet."
2,"Nice, light and quiet but too bad it stops working after 2 years","Review update: After 2 years of use, it stops working. It no longer collects any water. I guess this is meant for short term use.Previous review: We bought this dehumidifier for our basement. It really helps reducing the humidity there. Now it's no longer damp and smelly. We really like it because it's lightweight and it's very quiet. It doesn't heat up the place either. If only it has something to show the current humidity level of the room, it would be perfect."
1,lucky? worked for 3 years,I purchased mine in April 2007 and it has worked pretty well up until now. This week I pulled it out to deal with water in the basement and I get nothing but warm air circulation. No water collection. Seems like the compressor is gone. I borrowed an LG dehumidifier to help out and it is working pretty well.
5,Great Product,I absolutely love this product. I never realized how much humidity I had in my air until I got this. I get a tub of water out at least once a day. It is remarkable how much of a difference that it makes in the air quality in your home. I would recommend this product to anyone. We love it in our home!!!
4,dehumidifier,Works well at the one month point. Durability unknown.Soleus Air CFM-40E Dehumidifier - 40 Pint
5,Soleus CFM 40 - Dehumidifier,I've only had the unit for a month but it is quiet and pulls plenty of water out. I'm VERY pleased so far. The Whirlpool I had before worked OK for about 5 years but then quit dehumidifing even though it kept running. I was also VERY loud.
2,Soleus Dehumidifier Review,Drops the humidity only slightly but heats up the room significantly. I don't recommend it and wouldn't purchase another Soleus product.
1,Not worth a penny,"I had this dehumidifier and it lasted one year exactly, nice warranty period, it lasted just days past the 1 year mark and then quit working. I thought it was a fluke, so I bought another one, and it didn't work straight out of the box. I called SoleusAir to see what to do about returning it, and have only once before been treated so completely like dirt. I will never buy this product again, or anything from this manufacturer. Incidentally, I bought mine from Quality Matters.com and they have some of the worst customer service I've ever encountered, nearly incompetent, and wouldn't it be nice if they spoke English without sounding as though they are about to break into their native tongue?"
1,Compressor Died,"The compressor died less than a year after purchase. It seemed nice, quiet, air blown at about room temperature (unlike so many that blow warm/hot air). Looks like we're back to Sears brick and mortar. At least I can return it and they'll replace it (happened once before)."
2,Planned Obsolescence or what?,"I bought this unit last summer and used it to knock the relative humidity down to 50% when things got too muggy in the home. I must say that the unit worked well at extracting water from the air and did so silently, a nice feature when sleeping. But alas! I took the unit out last night to help painted rooms dry faster and then checked the bucket this morning only to find it bone dry! Broken, a unit that now only consumes electricity and blows air around. I get so annoyed that companies can build refrigerators that last 15 years but this product dies after only one year. I'm convinced this unit is manufactured as a throw away product in our disposable-obsessed culture."
1,Worked great for all of 3 months,"Worked like a charm for the first month or so, then worked sort of alright, then stopped collecting water altogether."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF GOOD MONEY,"This dehumidifier worked great for about 11 months and just stopped accumulating any water in the tank pan, Filter is clean. What's the problem? Soleus products are on my never to purchase ever again list. I have nothing else to say. Your product ""sucks""."
1,Dead after only 22 months--won't be buying a Soleus again,"The dehumidifier we had before this one was a GE model that lasted over 10 years. We bought this Soleus model in May, 2010; it worked fine for almost two years and then died. This time, we bought a Frigidaire and are hoping it lasts a little longer than the Soleus."
1,Worked for about a year then quit,"It worked great for a full season and a little into the next but then stopped pulling out water. It appears to be working but the water collector remains bone dry, no matter how humid it is. It is just using electricity. It seems like a good product when it works but it apparently isn't designed to last long enough to get your value out of it."
5,Soleus Air CFM-40 40 Pint Dehumidifier w/Humidistat,"What a great surprise! My old unit was heavy, unattractive and very loud. The Soleus is whisper quiet, attractive styling and lightweight enough to carry without difficulity. This unit's noise level is that of a small fan...It is so quiet that I find myself checking it out to see if it is running:) The water collection bucket is easy to remove and empty, or, as I did, attach a plastic hose to fitting and run to floor drain or sump hole. The price of Soleus 40 pint unit is reasonable. Amazon's website when ordering is outstanding...I ordered my unit one afternoon and delivery was made the next afternoon. Good as it gets! This dehumidifier is outstanding...You won't be sorry on your purchase."
2,Good while it last,This product works great when it worked. Mine stopped working with less than a year's non-intensive use. But it seems every other dehumidifiers have the similar problem of breaking down after one year's use. I would love to have one that is reliable for at least two years. But don't know which brand.
5,I think it works great....,"We live in Florida and bought this product because the apartment we recently rented has a crazy moisture problem. The apartment is so air tight that there is no airflow and we found out that we had a leak which caused a lot of condensation on the windows and a very musty smell. From the very first time we used it, we loved it. It cleared up the sliding glass door and the windows within 20 min. We use it a little everday and the musty smell is finally going away!!! Our place is about 1000 sq. and we have to move it if we want it to work in other rooms, but we don't mind"
2,Good while it lasted,"Like other reviewers, I had a good experience with the portable Soleus 40-Pint dehumidifier...while it worked. I received it in September 2007, and it had quit working by the end of summer 2009. The motor/fan continued to run, but it completely ceased removing water from the air. Back when it was running correctly, it was reasonably quiet and effective, and I liked its relative portability. I never had trouble with it overflowing, although it was common to slosh some water out of the bucket while emptying it. Since I don't enjoy trying to figure out how to properly recycle such bulky items, I won't be buying another one."
4,Good product: terrible customer service from Soleus,"If the unit is received in good working order and no physical defects, then I recommend the dehumidifier. If there are any defects in the unit upon receipt, then you are in for a real wrangle with Soleus customer service."
1,Fails Just after one year,I've owned two of these units in the last two years and both failed to defrost themselves just after the one year warranty ran out and then just totally failed to do anything afterwards. Chinese made Junk. Buy something with a longer warranty.
1,"Stopped working after 2 months, poor support from Soleus Air","I have purchased items from Amazon for years and this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. I did a lot of research and thought this product would solve my problem. It was fine until it stopped working after 1.5 months of use. Soleus Air customer service agreed that I had received a defective product. They would replace it, but only when I returned the defective (heavy) unit at my own cost. I was rather surprised as we all agreed this unit was defective. The person I spoke with sugggested I write an email to ""management"" requesting my shipping be paid. I did but have had no response and it's been 2 weeks. I have a dehumidifier on its way to me, but they are holding my VISA number until I return the defective one.What a disappointing purchase and experience with a company."
3,Great unit but short life span,"Decided to try the Soleus brand even though a little more expensive after having two Kenmore Dehumidifiers that kept dying around the two year mark.I run the dehumidifier every day in my 615 sq ft apartment for approximately 9 hours and it does a good job collecting moisture and the controls are easy to use. However, as of yesterday, the unit runs but no longer collects any moisture so looks to be effectively ""dead"".The unit is only 1 year 11 months old...unfortunately, outside the 1 year warranty. I'm only rating this unit a 3 as I'm disappointed the unit didn't last longer for the price."
1,Very pretty - short lived,"The 25-pint machine from this company worked great for a few weeks. Then it went kaput. Trying to contact the company proved fruitless. The machine still runs, but it does not take any water out of the air."
1,Defective Batch,"I received my first unit on 9/30/2008. It worked great for a few days; it ran quietly and effectively dehumidified the air. It worked so well that the drainage tank had to be emptied up to 3 times a day. Then randomly, in less than a week, the unit stopped working. Amazon's great customer support agreed to send out a replacement unit on 10/9/2008. I received the replacement the following day, on 10/10/2008, and it did not work either. During the 2.5 days that I continuously ran the unit, it has not dehumidified the surrounding air. This is unacceptable. It rained outside while the unit was running and there was also the humid air from the showers that I had taken during this time period. This replacement unit has not collected a single drop of water in its tank! I am disappointed in this product. It is expensive and it does not serve its purpose."
1,"Worked great for awhile - then broke, don't know when","Bought the 40 pint unit in January, 2007. Hooked it up for continuous drainage after checking that it worked. Don't know when it stopped working. Probably right about the time the year warranty was up. The unit continued to operate - just stopped dehumidifying. I have seen that complaint here before. So check the drainage hose often. Hopefully you'll find it broke before the warranty expires. Same experience with customer service - I can pay to send it in and pay to get it back and pay for them to fix it. By the time I did that, might as well just buy a new unit. I won't be buying any Soleus products ever again."
1,BEWARE OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT!,"This product worked well, until it stopped working. I used it for a couple of years, then it stopped functioning. I attempted to contact customer support to get it repaired, and was very disappointing with the results. Not only will they not give you any information on how you might get it repaired locally, the only repair option available is for you, the customer, to ship this heavy item to their southern California address. Believing that getting it fixed would still be cheaper than a new unit (and environmentally better) I shipped it via UPS, which costed $40. After about a week, I get a call from their customer service saying the unit was unrepairable. No explanation, no description of the problem. Of course I left it with them instead of losing more money. Yes, the unit worked well, but I will NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING AGAIN FROM THIS MANUFACTURER. THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE! Pay the extra money and buy a product you can get fixed."
5,works great in our espresso bar...,"Our Coffee shop, at 500 square feet, is constantly steamed up from the espresso machine (steam wands). Condensation would puddle on the floor, and it was so moist that our two doors warped, making it a chore to throw the deadbolt at the end of the day. We bought this unit, it arrived within 5 days,we put it at the back of the shop, and WHAM! No more condensation!! We empty the bucket twice each day, and this little machine just keeps going and going and going 24/7.... and yes, the doors have dried out, which makes my baristas VERY happy! The bonus here is that it's really quiet, even on the highest setting. Great product!"
5,Great product!,The read the reviews of this dehumidifier and was greatly impressed. The reviews are accurate. The dehumidifier is exceptionally quiet. I replaced my 12 year old dehumidifier with this one and the progress the years have made is substantial. I can barely hear this dehumidifier running. It's also much lighter. The amount of water it removes from the air is substantial. I haven't hooked it up to drain directly so I manually empty it twice per day. Each time it's full. I'm very pleased with this product.
1,Buy at your own risk,This unit stopped working a little over a year after the purchase. The fans still blows out the compressor no longer turns on to remove moisture.
3,NOT for vacation cabin!,"This product would be rated 5 stars if not for the dummy ""engineer"" who causes the unit to run 24/7, even after humidity level has been reached. This is NOT GOOD for vacant vacation cabins! Also, if the power goes out and the owner is not there, the unit STAYS OFF! NOT GOOD! Otherwise if you are present to overcome above problems the Soleus is a great product. I read the reviews before I bought but somehow missed the continuous fan problem."
4,Soleus Dehumidifier,"I like the Soleus unit in terms of its small size and performance at the low setting, and it is very quite, the quietest dehumidifier I have ever had. Unfortunately ours only works at the low setting and then only on the continuous cycle, so I will have to send it in for service at the end of the summer."
4,Best dehumidifier,"We have tried at least 3 other brands of dehumidifier, but the Soleus CFM-40E has been the only one that runs quiet enough for us to recommend. We bought our first Soleus CFM-40E three years ago. It quit dehumidifying on us two months ago. We bought our second one last month. It worked as good as the first. Maybe it will last at least another 3 years. Highly recommended."
4,Great dehumidifier for the price.,We have downstairs bathroom with no ventilation so we needed something to keep the mold from growing on everything. One option was to run the central AC all the time and keep the whole house cold. This is a much better option!Just started this last night and has already taken a GALLON of water from the air. The bathroom feels better and warmer since we started running this machine. It is quiet enough that we can't hear it in the next room. It appears to be well built.One feature I like is that I can hook a hose to it and allow it to drain constantly so I don't have to keep emptying it.
4,"Working OK, I think","This dehumidifier is attractive, works quietly, and collected the expected amount of water before I started the house A/C. When the house humidity is down because of the A/C operation, I expected the dehumidifier to automatically shut off when the selected moisture level was achieved in the house (as my old one did), but it doesn't. This does not seem right - I must manually shut off the unit when the humidity level is down unless I want to leave the dehumidifier run continuously."
1,Worked well for 2 weeks and died,"Worked well for 2 weeks and died. It stopped pulling water out of air and just ran continuously. I have a hydrometer, so I know what the moisture content is in my room. The product looks nice, is fairly quiet, and worked well for a little while. I'm glad it broke within 2 weeks so that I can return it to Amazon for a refund. I hear using the 1 year warranty is impossible with the manufacture. Now I have to look for something else. Good luck folks."
1,broken after only one year.,"It worked well, but only for one year.Called manufacture, they say out of warranty, can't help.Be aware.Buy something more reliable."
3,Works well - auto shut off is iffy,This is a great unit. It keeps up with about 4-500 sf of our house with 3 adults and 2 dogs. The only issue we've had is that the automatic shutoff switch doesn't always trigger. We just empty it regularly and if we want to set it up for a long period (i.e. vacation) we connect to the handy continuous drain plug.
5,Best I've used,"After having 2 failed Maytag units from Home Depot, at almost twice the price I tried this one. WOW works 10 times better then the Maytags and you can not hear it running unless you are standing next to it. GREAT PRODUCT AND EVEN BETTER PRICE!!!"
4,Good and quiet machine,I decided to purchase this item after carefully reviewing online comments. It's very quiet. It works great so far. However the machine didn't come with any warranty information and I hope I won't need it. I wish the drainage hose comes with it.
2,"Good dehumidifier, if monitored","If you are sure you will never have a power glitched (even a blip), then this dehumidifier may be for you. It works well, pulls moisture from the air, but the slightest interruption of power 'turns it off'.I bought it to use on my boat WHEN I AM NOT THERE!!! Marina power sources are notoriously flickery, and it worked for 2 days before the powerhit turned it off. Damp boat.I probably should have realized that 'electronic' meant power sensitive. I wish I had saved my Mumma's old Sear's on/off power button unit. Worked like a champ, 15 years after purchasing it.This thing goes on ebay."
1,Terrible Warranty/dependability,"I only got 1 season out of this dehumidifier....don't be fooled by the quiet.....it is quietly not working and all the company could say was sorry sir, but the warranty has expired....wow...soooo disapointed, stay away from SOLEUS...by a Kenmore or one that will run for years and years......I embrace the noise, because the Kenmore I have has worked for 10 years.....Run from Soleus...don't waste your money!"
2,Works well but puts out too much heat.,"Worked well in pulling the moisture out of the air. However, it was blowing out air 20-25 degrees warmer than the ambient temperature. So if I ran it on a humid 75 degree day, it would blow out dry air at 95 degrees. Measured the temp using a couple of different thermometers. Maybe I had a dud!"
1,Read the negative reviews first!,"Ours worked wonderfully for 6 months. Now, the fan goes on but it does not pull water from the air. The water collection bucket remains bone dry even when we run it all night.So, if you think it makes sense to go through 2 dehumindiers every year, this could be the product for you."
3,"Quiet, but humidistat not working out of box","Compared with the previous three dehumidifiers I had, this one is much, much quieter. I am very happy with this feature. But the humidistat is not working out of the box. Whichever setting I chose, only the fan was blowing but the compressor would not kick in. I am now using the continuous setting. Also, I hope the reservior is bigger."
5,Excellent Sharpener System,"Easy to use. Perfection from LanskyI have also purchase yellow and sapphire hones.I use them after I done with diamond hones to polish my blade from scratches, that diamond hones left on it,to make it shiny and smooth, like a mirrorI'm very satisfied with the result!!!Excellent!!! All my knives are razor sharp- FINALLY!!!"
5,Diamond better than stone,"I've used the stone version of the Lansky Sharpening system but find the diamond system to be a lot less likely to clog. However, if you don't believe you'll be using the system all that much, perhaps the added expen$e of the diamond hones might not make it a good value for you; purchase the stone hones instead. I don't use the honing oil packaged with the kit. I clean the diamond surface with water. Lansky makes a great product at a great price. You will find the system VERY easy to use after you've watched the instructional video found on Lansky's website."
2,Amerciana Wood Toy Box with Bin,"The toy box is nice, but im not happy with the product. The directions were difficult to understand and I didn't like the top being made of cloth material. My little boy already made a tear on it. I had to remove it, I was afraid my little boy would tear it."
4,Darwin rules,"I loved this book, but probably not for the reasons of most other readers. It reminded me of the Darwin Rules website and books celebrating the ways in which people find to remove themselves from the gene pool.Surely this applies to mountaineers! This is my conclusion after reading Maria Coffey's engaging book. She relates harrowing tale after harrowing tale in which these absurd risk takers try again and again to kill themselves. Eventually they all seem to succeded.It becomes hilarious after about the fourth chapter.Coffey does not try to make us feel sorry for those left behind. This is a wise ploy as it would only soften the impact of what she has to say, which is that these people cannot be helped, but perhaps understood."
3,Growing together,"It seems, it is a more EARTHY version ofThe O.C. - The Complete Series Collection, of which characters are mostly concerned of real things than sizes of diamonds might be purchased by others, as family jewels are of plot's core importance and instant attention.That is, probably, why -for a pure materialism- it is not so staringly entertaining."
3,my review,the reason why i gave 3 stars is because i have yet to receive my season 4 of One Tree Hill. i purchased all 5 seasons from amazon.com but the fourth season came from an outside seller. i have yet to receive it. its been over a month. if you would know why i havent received it or a way i can receive it...let me know!!!
5,One Tree Hill-Fourth Season,My Complete Fourth Season was shipped to me the next day and recieved it right away.Thank you so much!
3,okay,"the dvd was in okay condition. it said like new and the box was beat up. there were two discs where i couldn't see the entire episode because it skipped and then my dvd player couldn't read the disc. i had to restart the entire dvd and skip that chapter of the episode. but, i was able to watch most of the season."
3,One Tree Hill DVD review,"Most of the disks in the series worked very well, and One Tree Hill is a great show, but the final disk would not play at all. It was completely scratched and unusable before I even opened the package."
1,Wow.....Bad,"After a solid 3 seasons, One Tree Hill took an awful dive in season 4. What a rush job and just ridiculous plots. I thought I was watching General Hospital after awhile. They totally went away from the first 3 seasons. They kind of caved in and tried all this ""shock"" and rated ""R"" stuff just to be noticed. SO DISAPPOINTING!!!!!I pray season 5 is better."
2,Season 4 sucked.,"I've been watching this show since season 1 and I have all previous seasons on DVD, but I will not be buying season 4 due to the fact that it was by far the worst season. What made it so bad? Well 1.) A lot of characters didn't interact for a large portion of the season (i.e.- Lucas and Brooke), 2.) the addition of unnecessary new characters, 3.) so many bad plot lines were dragged out way too long while the good ones were either ruined by crappy writing, or cut short too soon...I could go on and on. All in all, a BIG disappointment for me. Season 5 better make up for this mess of a past season!"
5,what i think,i think that this is one of the happy and sad moments in the show the store is very good because it make you wonder what really happend in the water. its very good.and sad because your not sure who is going to live.
5,Love!!!,I love love love this show!! its is my all time favorite so i recommend that everyone should buy it! :]
2,Broken Case,"Product was in fine working condition, and I brought it directly from Amazon. But the case itself was damaged and broken and I will never order any Box set like items from Amazon again."
1,More info needed.,How many mil. in thickness???How many gallons in capacity each?How many bags per package?
4,Rototiller Review,"This rototiller, while smaller than anticipated, does the job I need it to on my half acre of land. It actually worked out better that it wasn't the size that I thought it was because it may have been too big. I use it about once a year to till garden space and it performs wonderfully and is relatively easy to start. I have loaned it to family members to use for their gardens as well and have good feedback from them on the tillers performance as well."
5,PHENOMENAL!,"Karl Stanley is an amazing man with an incredible passion for underwater exploration. His remarkable energy and enthusiasm will make you realize that even your biggest dreams are not impossible to reach. After watching this movie, you will want to jump into his sub and see the mind-blowing view from below yourself (which is possible if you pay him a visit in Roatan)."
5,"A Powerful, gritty urban movie","Hurricane Streets is a gritty urban movie made in the late 90's. It's about a kid (Brendan Sextant III) who runs his own crew of kid street thieves and sells his goods on the streets. He meets a girl and his outlook of what's important changes overnight as well as discovering the truth about why his mother is in jail and why he lives with his grandmother. It's a powerful, truthful, hard-hitting look at youth out of control.I saw it when I was 25 and it really spoke to me, because it was exactly like my childhood (Almost spookingly exact, actually!) I've seen it entirely too much and my VHS copy is now nearly unwatchable and I am extremely happy it finally made its way to DVD! That way I'll always be able to watch it and remember the trials and tribulations of my own life growing up as well."
4,SIGNS,"Good CD..... if you buy CDs, and you are a fan of these guys buy this one. You should like it. Many of my favorite bands have released albums in 2005, and it seems that my more hardcore favorites have gone a little soft. I don't know why but it's beginning to change the genre of music I listen too. Anyway, I'm not saying they are hardcore or that they are selling out or anything. I am just saying they are a little softer than the last couple of CDs. Good cd though... good CD."
4,Really good,"This is my favourite effort from the band so far. They've maintained the sound that brought in their fanbase but also, they've expanded on it and matured a bit out of that crappy emo stage. The production is great, and the musicianship seems tigher as well as having a better understanding of what they're playing as opposed to just playing it. Great effort, boys. Good rock album."
4,Great CD! FFAF are so the best band ever!,This CD is so amazing and has great cover art. FFAF are my favourite band and the song roses for the dead shows how good they truly are. This is their worst CD out of the 3 but it still one of my favourites of all time. Hours has great songs like streetcar and also is very emotional with great screams.Truly Amazing!FFAF forever!
4,Its ok,I've been anticipating this album for a long time. FFAF's first and second album were amazing. Though musically and lyrically they have matured the lack of screaming sucks. I love this band but I was wishing they would scream alot more. Actually the only song that has screaming (for only like 20 sec) is the end of nothing. The c.d. is good but not as good as their prior releases.
2,I've learned my lesson on impulse buying...,"OK, so I was downtown, saw this in Woolworths, I'd heard one or two songs from ""Casually Dressed..."" and I'd liked them a little. I had a bt of spare money and the shop wasn't carrying much worth interest in, so I ended up taking it home. What a waste of a tenner.The reason for the low score is because this album has NO musical direction. It seems to be content just oozing emo for 40 minutes-odd. Honestly, I've listened to the whole album, and I can't remember a note apart from the intro to ""Recovery,"" the only good thing on this album and the only thing saving it from one star. It may not be actively irritating, but it has no redeeming features either. It's just the same bland mess from start to finish. So if you want my advice, download ""Recovery"" somewhere, listen to the first thirty seconds, then forget this album exists."
2,I've had better,"Not to say that this band is untalented, but it wasn't what I expected. The first time listening to this album it was alright. But then I noticed the more I listen to this CD the less I wanted to hear it. It's worth checking out but not buying. It was just too mellow."
4,A good FFAF album,"I first bought this cd and listened to it once without even really paying attention to it. Then later kept on hearing the Streetcar song on fuse and got addicted to it. I then therefor listened to the entire album again and again, but i only like about 7 of the songs on there, so it deserves 4 stars. Im really addicted to it, theres a lot of good songs on here, its kind of a more softer side of them with less screaming. My favorite songs are History and Roses for the Dead. I like history even though its really soft core but still great and makes me feel good, this album is really good and i would recommend it to anyone, specially old ffaf fans. Give it a shot, could go either way."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"This album is a real contender for worst cover art ever. If you're going to put a random girl who has nothing to do with your band on your cd cover, at least pick one without a pig nose. The music is pretty generic and boring. I still have a little bit more respect for these guys than most generic emo bands, but this music really is totally overproduced, the guitars just blend together into a flowing drone that seems to fade to background noise because it gives you nothing to focus on, and the drumming is so monotonous. It's kinda hypnotic, like the music is trying to put you to sleep. You start listening to a song, and then next thing you know it's over, and you're like what happened, where did the time go."
1,YAWN!!!,"This is basically another emocore tripe that tries too hard to be punk and metal and it still fails miserably. There really is at best four or five metalcore bands that I like ,but this can't even compare, boring riffs, unimpressive ""solos"", hack bassist, and a drummer that can't even get his beats right. The lyrics are just whiny and cheesy, no real sense of maturity or maybe even penmenship and it's just more lyrical rehash from their other albums. You want some good punk go for The Clash, The Ramones, Black Flag, The Misfits, Sublime and Suicidal Tendencies. For great metal, Soilent Green, Venom,Celtic Frost, Suffocation, Voivod, Metal church, Behemoth, Daath, Amon Amarth and Mastodon. Just skip this eyelinecore junk altogether."
5,Nice progression,"I can't stop listening to this record. I believe ""The End of Nothing"" is now the new FFAF anthem. They defintely took a different approach with the vocals and melodies which I feel are excellent. I can't wait to see of some of this stuff play live."
2,eh..and that's about it,"I've read quite a few spec ops books; fiction, historical, good, bad...and this book falls in the ""eh"" catageroy. It was mildly entertaining, the characters were mildly believable, and the story was predictable at best. Thankfully, the monotany of the pedestrian plot was boken up by action sequences and jungle tracking/stalking scenes. But even those were defeated by the fact that you *knew* that they would always make it out safe or find their man. if you have nothing better to do pick up this book. You might like it you might not. enjoy."
1,Toxic red paint???,"I received this item with red paint on the packaging materials that were in contact with the tetsubi. I then noticed that the coloring wiped off very easily and when wiped with a wet sponge it would wring out red water! I tried to contact Joyce Chen numerous times regarding this issue, but they did not reply. I don't know what the red paint/stain is composed of, but I'm concerned about lead or other toxic materials since it's hard to keep some water from not touching the exterior when using the tetsubi. I would not recommend this item until that issue has been resolved. I feel strongly enough about this that is caused me to write my first Amazon review after hundreds of purchases."
1,booo,"I had ordered this product nearly a month now and nothing. Where is my stuff. we are in the pre-season of the track and field season, information is critical. I am livid, am angry."
3,Classic Star Trek,"Classic Star Trek. Not flawless, but pretty good. Murdock's debut is worthy of a read.Kirk has to figure out motives of the Romulans to prevent galactic war. Other federation persons are on his side, but a rogue federation admiral must be thwarted to keep peace."
1,A waste of $2.80!,"After enjoying other trek books from authors such as Diane Duane, A.C. Crispin, D.C. Fontana this book was very disappointing. The characters were one dimensional, the dialog flat and almost plastic. The next time I feel the need to waste 3 dollars I'll go buy a couple National Enquirers, at least the writing would probably be better!!"
4,"Hours of big tire, monster trucking fun!!!","This game is great for putting you right in the drivers seat and out in the trenches. Big tires, loud pipes, and rocking monster trucks is what it's all about!"
4,Depends on which one you want!,"Let's face it, Speed(5 stars) is a wonderful Action movie, problably the best Action movie of the year, but Speed 2(3 stars) doesn't live up to the original as well as I thought it would. The movie would be so much better if Keanu Reeves reprised his role as Jack Traven. Dennis Hopper was a great villian in the original."
3,Skimpy on details,"Mostly this book talks about what services ArcSDE provides. Details on how to set up ArcSDE and get it working with your RDBMS are sorely lacking. For this kind of information, the book refers you to several other sources."
1,No Results,"The product instructions state to take this product 3x per day but, I admittingly, for the most part, took it 2x per day. The pills were quite large & hard, so sometimes they made me gag. It has been over a month now and I have not noticed ANY improvements in my hair, skin, or nails. Actually, my skin seems to be very dry now. Not sure if it is from this product, but as of today, I am not taking any more. The last 10 pills have been flushed.Michael's Health Products - Hair Skin & Nails, 90 tablets"
5,"OUTSTANDING, INCREDIBLE, AMAZING, WONDERFUL","I'm listening to this right now and I can't stop. I read ""Left Behind"" and due to the tremedus popularity I can't even find #2; so I've skipped to #3, ""Nicolae""! The action is amazing, and to think that it could actually happen. The reading by Jack Sondericker is simply splendid. It will defenitly bring you into the world during the Tribulation. If you don't want to read it, this will ABSOLUTELY console for it."
5,Incredible!,"I'm hooked. After listening to the other two, I could hardly wait to listen to this one. I started making up excuses to get in the car to listen. Once you start, you too will get hooked. I hope the hurry up with the next one, I'll be first in line to buy it!"
5,Left Behind: Borat's Rise to Power.,"So, who casted the guy who plays Nicolae?? he sounds like Borat!!""Please! Do no being afraid you!! I am peacefuls coming! I build New Babylon! Great Successs!""This is comedy gold, people!!"
5,More excellent drama from Gap Digital,"It's LaHaye/Jenkins' bestselling series brought to life on the ""big screen"" of your imagination!Wonderful actors, splendid music, super sound effects, and heart-pumping thrills are packed into this dramatization of the third book in the Left Behind series.In Nicolae, the Tribulation Force (formed in books 1 and 2) are reeling from the strike of World War III. Rayford finds himself piloting the antichrist himself to safety, whie his other friends struggle to remain alive amidst the chaos of war.The two best scenes in this series are 1) Buck Williams' rescue of Tsion Ben-Judah, exiled from the Holy Land for proclaiming the truth about the Messiah, and the gigantic earthquake in the last episode.Brilliant work for your ""theater of imagination"", and even better than a movie could be."
1,COULDN'T SUPPLY ITEM,I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU A REVIEW OF THIS PRODUCT BUT I CANNOT BECAUSE I NEVER RECIEVED ITEM. THIS ITEM IS IN HIGH DEMAND AND MANUFACTURER SHOULD PRODUCE MORE.
1,Soleus Air MW-55 - worthless water coolers,"Both myself and my inlaws bought this unit. Within a few months both of us experienced a loud noise, intermittent water cooling and leaking. Within 1 year both units have completely failed cooling water and are scrap. I expect a water cooler to last more than a year. Get the word out and don't waste your money."
3,Problems,"The unit arrived in a undamaged box, but after unpacking I found the top & 2 inside pieces cracked, & the compressor broken loose on 2 of 4 sides, too late to refuse del. I emailed Soleus, luckly I had taken pictures as I found the problems, after I sent them the photos they sent me new parts, now the unit is working OK, but this is after a lot of work, (& not ever one would be able to do this work OR would want too) !!! I think the reason for the damage was being shipped upside down, again the shipping box arrived in good shape, so IF you buy the unit, Good luck !"
4,"Great water cooler, decent frige.","I would recommend this product. It makes water very cold, and very warm. It took just minutes from placing the room-temp water bottle on, and it changing to being warm and cold. The refrigerator is not as effective. It takes a while for the fridge to cool, each time you open the door. The frige works perfectly for light use. Also, after ordering, make sure the drain cap is tightly closed, as it arrives open, and it will leak small amounts in the back. Overall good buy, and recommended for water cooling."
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this water cooler at Fry's Electronics. And like some of the other reviewers wrote, the refrigerator is useless. And last night I come home to find my breakfast area floor wet. All the water from the new 5 gallon bottle had leaked out. After dis-assembling the unit, I discovered the hot water tank was cracked. So this unit maybe lasted 2 1/2 years."
2,Do not buy,"I bought this locally and it looks great, but that's all. It doesn't cool when it needs to. The hot water is always hot, but I don't use it unless I'm eat cup o noodles. The cold water is only really cold in the evening. I need it cold when I drink it."
4,"Small refrigerator, but good water cooler","This cooler performs its basic function--dispensing hot and cold water--very well. The refrigerator is quite small and very low to the ground, limiting its usefulness. Overall, a good unit."
1,Lasted a little over a year then ....,"This unit worked OK after purchasing but was not good at all refrigerating items (always luke warm). After a little over a year, the unit started making noises when the refrigerator tried to cool and then it started leaking like crazy. I finally go a hold of Soleus tech support (totally useless!) and they basically told me that it was probably cracked or the tubes (still don't know where these are!) disconnected somehow although the unit was never moved since I got it! After reading all the reviews here, I would NEVER recommend this cheaply made product!"
2,Nutshell book only ok,"This book does cover the main laws governing employee benefit plans, but it does not provide enough explanation and examples. A good textbook on ERISA will do a much better job of walking you through the different rules and will also provide case law that helps illustrate ERISA application. I would not recommend spending your money on the nutshell book if you are also planning to buy an ERISA textbook. However, if you just want a relatively inexpensive book to read in order to get an overview of ERISA, then this book is ok."
2,GET REAL WARNERS !!,"Forget these overpriced dvd-r's with no subtitles or anything. This is a 74 minute ""B"" western that's 64 yrs old-package it to sell-put them in a collection, subtitle them and price them fairly-the way things are going now with the dvd-r's is a travesty."
2,No review of this item,"This disc would not play on either of my dvd players-wish I had know that before I ordered it, therefore, there wasn't any review."
2,Pass up this Non-Essential Book,"I was greatly disappointed in this book. I asked for it as a birthday present and promptly returned it. This book is not for people seriously interested in modern interior design or architecture. The book was Martha Stewart-type fluff. While filled with photographs, even those were barely interesting and certainly were not memorable."
3,Compendiumof Modern Design,"This book is useful if you want general hints (the first part) and some practical hints (at the end) on modern European style trends of ten years ago. Rather artsy, but fun to look at."
1,false claim,"They mentioned in their product review: ""Optically clear, non-reflective film ensures long-lasting, crystal clear screen images""I got tricked into thinking that they have an anti glare film. When i used it , it was a normal screen. Nothing ""non reflective"" and ""optically clear"". Waste of money"
1,Not even close to fitting a 15.6 laptop,I purchased these for 15.6 Lenovo laptops and they didn't come close to fitting the screen. I would have been fine if it was only a little around the edges but we're talking an inch or so on each side. The product description listed 1x1x1 as the size - it would have been much more helpful (and saved me a lot of time) if they gave the actual size. I have no opinion as to the quality of material or the installation because I never got past opening the package before I found out these were useless to me.
4,"A ""foolish"" book with plenty of good investment advise.","When I picked up this book I thought I would have to take its advise with a grain of salt. These two do a good job informing the reader how to be a foolish investor. They contend the wise men of wall-street, the ones who know everything, constantly underperform the market averages. Therefore one needes to be a fool when investing. It's a book that is ver informative and helps the novice invester get started on wall-street."
4,"Good, but difficult to believe some points.","I enjoyed this book (although checking it out at the library takes some of the pressure off). It helped me understand some things about investing, and the mutual fund section was one heck of an eye opener! Next month, I'm switching over to the Vanguard Index Fund, for sure! But I found their ""foolish Four"" dividend investing thing hard to believe. It can't be THAT easy to beat the pros, can it? I'd love to hear from people that have actually tried it since the book came out. Email me, if you've tried it. Let me know how it went."
4,"Yes, but","A lot of information here, but if you are planning to use the internet to really get more bang for your buck and find the best deal around then you also need a book like Trading Online (FT Pitman) by Patel."
4,Great Way To Getting Started,"I highly recommend this book for people interested in investing but are not sure where to begin. It gives you the basics of getting started and the motivation to handle your own money. The Gardner's gives a little more attention to the ""younger generation"" and therefore makes reading comprehensive and entertaining. A Must Buy, for new investors."
4,Good for beginning investors,"-- People who *should* read this book: 1) Beginning Investors. 2) Conservative Investors. 3) People without the time to manage their investments, and who are willing accept smaller returns.-- People who *should not* read this book: 1) Experienced investors. 2) Short term investors. 3) Day traders.In short, this book is a good intro. to investing for beginners and has a long-term, conservative slant. The first part of the book is easy reading, but it gets a little drier toward the end."
5,Excellent introduction to the novice investor,"This book will explain to you the basics of investing in a user friendly way. It is full of common sense. It warns of the pitfalls in allowing other people manage your finances, people who get to make money out of you even if they do not perform. It also shows how you can do better than them with a small investment of your time. I highly recommned everyone read this book before they are too old to do anything about their retirement funds."
4,A Great Book,This book is very easy to read and it makes it easy to understand how the market works. I would reccomend it to anyone who is just entering the investment world.
1,Mistaken,"I thought the book would be about buying and selling shares for the short to medium term, but this book is for the long term investor.. so why not read Warren Buffett?????Or for short/Medium term stuff - Market Wizards by Schwager or Mind of a Trader by Patel?"
1,This book was the worst one ever! I couldn't bare to finish!,I couldnt believe how terrible this book was. To all readers; please dont waste your time reading this book and dont waste your money buying it.
2,Remix of Graham's Intelligent Investor,"This is just another version of Graham's Intelligent Investor, which is worse than original thoug"
3,Get a little bit more serious for a lot more expertise,"It's all very well to be jovial about investment and the Fools are to be congratulated for removing the cob-webs of this stuffy world, but at the end of the day making money is also serious if you want to make a serious amount.That is why although I enjoyed this book, I preferred The Mind of a Trader (FT Pitman, May 1998) which thorugh interviews and insights from incredibly profitable traders (one made an average of $250,000 each trading day for 8 years, gave more insight and taught more. And it still kept a light hearted appraoch (eg. in terms of taking profits too quickly and letting losses accumulate, one trader said ""You can't eat like a bird and shit like an elephant!"""
4,"Great for beginners, but not for the established investor","A really solid book if you're interested in dabbling in the stock market. The Gardners give some good solid, albeit basic, advice for ""beating the market average"". It's a good place to get a foothold if you've never invested. As far as their online forum goes, you can probably find all of this same information, but having a print version for bedtime reading is better."
3,A humourous book,"5 stars if this were a humour book, but it only gets 3 stars as in investment book.I enjoyed the cheeky ragging that professional fund managers received from the authors. It's nice to know that small investors can beat professional fund managers and achieve better returns if we adopt a cautious and common sense approach to investing in stocks.However, it seems to me that the fool's ratio was formulated by looking at the historical performance of the Dow component stocks, and then coming up with a selection criteria which would yield a better-than-Dow-average return.I just don't have the confidence that the fool's ratio will prove to be just as successful in the future."
3,Great Irony,"This month I bought two books-this one and SAVE PENNIES, BANK MILLIONS. I was expecting to get the 'nuts and bolts' of trading and stock analysis from MOTLEY FOOL but it turned out to be more educational for the long term focus instead. SAVE PENNIES, BANK MILLIONS which deals with general finance issues actually gave me the nuts and bolts I was looking for in terms of 'in & out' day trading in just a couple of chapters. MOTLEY FOOL wasn't quite what I expected but I am pleased with both."
1,Sloppy and full of errors.,"The themes of the book are basically good advice. The problem is that their homework is very sloppy. Lots of factual errors and no backtesting of their statements. In fact, many of their supposed unbeatable strategies haven't worked since the book was published!!! It's easy to find strategies that have worked in the past. Can they provide us with information on what will work in the future? Not in this book."
3,A little outdated,"This book was very informative and enjoyable. I feel as though I've gotten a start on learning how to pick a good stock. However, the information presented within seems a little outdated and is no longer in concert with the Motley Fool website. In fact, you will be hard pressed to find the exact information anywhere online. The extremely Spartan examples contained within seemed to be geared more towards daily financial newspapers and mailings from companies than actual information that is available instantly on a myriad of financial sites."
1,I was very disappointed with this book.,"This is an amusing book, but a new investor, or anyone, should be skeptical about their theories. If you critically examine their proofs and logic, you'll see their bias and the half truths very clearly. The authors have profitted from the great market conditions, over the last few years, but so have millions of other investors that have never heard of these two fools. Their humor and erroneous ""facts"", tend to wear thin after the first third of the text. This is an amusing book, but I certainly wouldn't base any financial plans on the opinions expressed, by the authors, in this book."
5,An Excellent Investment Book For Beginners,This book does a wonderful job of defining terms that other investment books just gloss over. It is informative and fun at the same time. Tom and Dave should be complimented for their effort. I am still fairly new to the investment world and found The Motley Fool a great asset. Everyone skeptical of investing themselves should read this book. Then get online and visit their site for all your daily investment needs
2,"OK for beginners, but full of self-congratulatory nonsense","An OK book for beginners, but there are better books out there. What I especially didn't like is the very low signal-to-noise ratio in the book. The Gardners would give you one good idea and then spend pages congratulating themselves about how great they are etc. If you can tolerate this and other insults to your intelligence, and if you are a beginner, then consider this book. Skip it if you have access to the articles on investing available on-line on AOL or other places"
1,A hot book on tape in 2001 proves an embarassment for the authors in 2005,"This book on tape was published early 2001 just in time for listeners to lose a ton in the 2001-2002 stock bust. Almost every investor lost money on stocks then, but a listener following the advice in this book on tape would have lost much more, with some tech stocks never recovering (because of bankruptcy).Some of the advice is quite good, but about 25% is downright wrong and dangerous. If you know enough to know which advice is good and which is bad, then you don't need this book.Perhaps something went wrong when abridging the longer written text to produce these audio tapes. In any event, if you still want to give it a shot, or if you just love the Motley Fool, then look for something by the Gardner brothers that's newer and/or not so abridged."
4,Motrley Fool Investment Guide,"Good primer for the beginner stock trader. Also an excellent review for those who have ""been around"""
2,I liked it.,"It seems as though you need quiet a bit of money tucked away before you start investing this way.I'm a mother of two little children and I just got out of major debt. The highest yielding Dow stocks cost a heck of a lot for a woman in my position. Lowest is at least $45 up to $90 per share. So you figure if I have to at least invest in 4 stocks with at least 25 shares than lets see......well you figure it out. I'm already frustrated from reading the book trying to narrow out the statistics.Don't get me wrong I liked the book it's just that I don't think it's for me until I actually win a lottery or something. I live pay check to pay check just barely making rent. Geeh...I don't think any of the investment books are for me???? But to those who have won a lottery than I highly recommend this book to y'all. Though, I would also recommend just borrowing it or any book from the library. (Gosh..I hope this message gets posted?!)"
5,I liked it!,"I bought this book 15 years ago when my husband was about to retire and we had to make investment decisions. It offered practical investing advice for the reader who does not have an interest in daily trading, who is a novice at investing,etc. It prompted us to develop a self-managed investing plan with which we have been very pleased. It is written in such an easy to understand manner that I recently bought this copy and gave it to friends. My re-reading of the text indicates its been updated but still holds the same appeal."
4,"as the title says, just a guide","This book provides different viewpoints for investing, but mainly profiles their strategy: finding those diamonds in the rough. With chapters titled ""maybe you should just buy mutual funds"" and ""maybe you should avoid mutual funds"", this book builds up to their main focus: providing good suggestions on valuing companies (with the focus on small cap companies).Having previously taken finance courses, I found this book as a good refresher. Written in a light hearted manner, this book was pleasing to read, rather than perusing old text books. As with any book, they showcase their views. I would recommend reading other books, not only to gain more knowledge of investing but to see other strategies."
3,Pretty Good for Beginners,"While this book is good for a beginning investor, some of what is included is dwelled upon too much. And, they try to peddle some of their opinions as hard facts. Ie, they try to say that options trading (or investing) is strictly gambling. This is not the case for everyone.It is good for a basic understanding of terms and principles, just take it with a grain (or box) of salt. I would recommend How to Make Money in Stocks by William O'Neill for anyone with at least a beginning understanding of investing. While O'Neill's approach is used for trading significantly, the fundamental techniques used in identifying good companies are excellent."
1,Beware,"This book, though clever, is dangerous. Don't ever buy a stock unless you have first consulted its chart, which contains essential information about a stock's prospects. You cannot simply by a stock and put it away. The movements of stocks are too unpredictable and too volatile to trade without using pre-determined stop loss points. You will lose money, as I did. I recommend instead O'Neil's How to Make Money in Stocks and Stan Weinstein's Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets, both excellent primers on how to invest like a pro."
5,great for long term investing,"very easy to read, explains why not to do things, and gives easy ways to pick high yield, high growth stocks"
1,Aptly titled,"Not the worst financial book out there, but right up there. I am tired of the same format for financial success books, and I have read them all (that tells you something about me, I guess)These guys rehash the same old theories and techniques that have been around forever. They have been at this a couple years, yet they write as if they were doing this for years. This book is just a selling gimmick for their AOL site. I notice their column in Smart Money has been discontinued.More of the same: ""You don't need a broker, financial planner, or research analysts, you just need us to help you discover these super duper secret stocks that will make you rich""Pass on this one unless you have never made investments before."
5,Timeless Hit Songs & Recent Gems,"This is a wonderful collection of Gilbert O'Sullivan's most memorable songs, including great hit songs like, Clair, Alone Again, Nothing Rhymed, plus recent masterpieces like, At the Very Mention of Your Name, Lost a Friend, I Wish I Could Cry, Dear Dream, and I'll Believe It When I See It, all of which share the wistful lyricism and the heart-felt poetry."
5,the very best of gilbert osullivan,I have enjoyed listening to the very best of gilbert o sullivan the quality of this cd is in excellent condition i highly recommend this seller to anyone 5 star rating will purchase again from this seller.Fast shipping arrived in perfect condition im one very happy customer.
2,One good idea,"The book has one good idea in it. You should know your good customers and seek a more profitable way to deal with ""not-so-good"" customers. It is pretty simplistic - but some companies probably need this insight.There are more in-depth research out there on this topic in the marketing and operations management journals."
1,Save your money,Got an energy boost the first few days but after that didn't even notice a difference and definately didn't result in weight loss. I have once again found that there isn't a magic pill - eat clean and the weight will fall off without any supplements required :D
3,Not so interesting.,"Even though I'm not finish with this book, I think that it is really boring. It doesn't have anyhting interesting about it. Well, maybe in the begining because that was what caught my attention but when it got to the middle it was just plain boring. I think that it shouldn't babble about how the parents fight and talk about how Pyungsoo is doing."
3,Gotta get the adapter.,"You need to get the FM adapter, otherwise you'll just be upset you paid so much for this and the XM radio for poor quality radio."
5,Thanks to the Reviewers,"I have a Samsung XM radio. Without the readers' review, I would not have known for for sure that the Pioneer Noon kit would work but it works fine."
4,Complete Set,"Very happy with this product. The only drawback I found was that the power cable is short (about 3 feet long), but if that is not an issue, then this product does the job."
1,parts broken,"The adhesive mount arrived broken. I need to call them and see if they will replace it.Otherwise, it's a good product and the price was right.Amazon Free Shipping is the best"
1,This is a rip off by XM,"You need to buy this item to active the ""FM Modulator"" that is built into the Inno Radio. But that is a joke because the only way that you are going to get sound thru your radio is if you plug the sure connect into the antenna which make the Idea of the availability to keep it simple and cheap a waste of time and money. Most cars don't have an antenna that you can get to let alone getting to the radio itself to make this work. $60.00 for this extra gadget and another $100 to have a professional install it correctly. Bottom line THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A WIRELESS FM MODULATOR, WIRED YES, WIRELESS NO!"
2,Don't count on the modulator.,I was excited to get my Inno I had very good experience with my Roady2. When I received my INCAR kit I hooked it up and the modulator did not work at all. I sent it back and got a new one. The bottom line is that the FM modulator is just worthless. I try to hold the Inno all around my car radio and only hear music through very bad static. I had to buy another car radio with a tape deck and the tape deck adapter with the INCAR kit. With that adapter the Inno sounds great.
3,The Final Edition of the Bandy Papers,"This is the last in a series of books that has taken our hero Bartholomew Bandy from the horrors of World War One trench warfare to the skies over England during the Battle of Britain. This last volume was published a couple of years after the death of author Donald Jack and to be honest, while the editors have done a good job in combining two early drafts into one book, there is no doubt in my mind that the finished product falls a little short of Donald Jack's usual high standards. That said, for Bandy fans this is still a very enjoyable read and definitely recommended."
4,"This is a solid book, but you need the series to learn","The books strengths are that it has a pedagogical focus and a progression of difficulty. Its weakness is that its glossary covers only new words in the lessons, not all Mandarin words. Also, my friends from China warn me that some of the dialogues are silly. Particularly in dating contexts, the conversations can have an adolescent tone. These weaknesses must be mentioned, but overall, strengths far outweigh weaknesses."
2,"too big, not enough fluff","I was very disappointed with this purchase. The wig I received looked nothing like the picture, except in that they were both pink. It was overly shiny and rather cheap. Also, it says it's for a child, but the wig was too big for my adult-sized head. I had to have it taken in."
3,Very Cute,"This wig is adorable. I originally bought it for a treasure troll costume. I thought because it was a children's wig it might fit perfect because I have a small head however the wig came in a ONFA and it is enormous. I could make a ponytail in the back with all the extra. However for the price and with the right alterations, this is a super fun and fabulous wig."
4,The book is really helpful to understanding Passage,"To be frank,I never have the chance to read the book,yet I ever read lots of essays and thesis telling me that the book is really helpful to a student intending to have a in-depth search of Passage,so I wish to get the book for a long time.Although I tried all means, I haven't gotten the book.That's why I've come to the Amazon."
1,Pay less?,the 1st and second seasons together are listed at 19.95the 3rd at 29.99being a math wizard that makes around 50.00$How is 71+$ paying less?
3,Would not recommend for young kids,Not sure what audience this would be suited for as it's a little scary for young children. My grandson would only watch the first few minutes and then asked me to turn it off.
4,Double Double Toil and Trouble,"Being a fan of the Olsen Twins, this was a very cute, entertaining Halloween movie with other very funny actors."
3,For kids only,My grandkids love this movie. They have watched it several times since it came. It is a typical Mary Kate-Ashley product.
1,Parents Beware,"I purchased this video and was appalled when I watched it with my child. The twins go home with a homeless man without a second thought! What kind of message is this for children? Plus, the movie has disturbing imagery, that I found scary even as an adult. This is not wholesome entertainment!Looking for a good ""scary"" movie for five+? Try The Ghost and Mr. Chicken with Don Knots. I loved it, and now all the many children in my life love it, too."
1,Don't get this video,"This is a scary show, not due to the Halloween content, but because two little girls run away from home, talk to a stranger (a homeless man, or ""hobo"", go into another stranger's house (who is a midget male clown), need I say more? Although these fellows turn out to be nice guys, we all know that doesn't always happen in the real world. Bad message for kids who are supposed to be learning not to talk to strangers!"
5,This movie is Awsome,"This movie was sooooooooooooooooo fun. I love it. I remember when the movie just came out my sister and I watched it so many times and we didn't get bored of it, i suggest you buy this movie if you like fun & adventurous movies.Jordyn"
3,"scary, all about Halloween, it's really good.","Mary Kate and Ashly's aunt is a witch; she wants to capture Mary Kate and Ashly and their good aunt is in the witch's mirror and Mary Kate and Ashly are trying to rescue her. It's a very scary video, and I really liked it. You'll be scared when you see the witch! by Beth, age 6"
3,"Nice, but a little scary for the younger group.","Even though this is a rated G movie, I think it should of been PG. There's some stuff that might scare the younger aged kids...like when the twing run away, and when that witch tries to hurt them with witch's spells. This scared me when I was 4. Now I love it, since I'm older."
2,creepy !!!!,"the olsens were adorible but this film is SO SO SO creepy it even scared me im 10 i wasnt even scared of the shining , i know creepy!!!!!mack thompson age 10"
4,Great songs overcome,"I borrowed this disc from a friend and I was just blown away by the first 3 songs. number 4 is ok. Number 5 is excellent. Then the cd suffers with some mediocre songs until number 13, ""Loudspeaker over Telephone"". This is one of the best songs I have ever heard. The use of harmonics in the intro is just awesome. It just makes me want to rock out. The cd is a little uneven but the great songs overcome the mediocre ones."
2,Boring Repetitive Breaks,This album is barely a step beyond four on the floor. And the most repetitive techno I've heard in a long time. I'd only consider it a great album if it had been released in 1995 - but come on - Listen to DJ Baby Anne or Icey if you want breaks.
3,Misleading,"There are lots of good tips about moving in this book and ""After the Boxes are Unpacked"" ... but it didn't say anywhere in the descriptions of the books that they are Christian books. In fact, it doesn't even mention that on the front or back covers of the books."
5,A GUITAR VIRTUOSO OF THE FIRST ORDER,"This album (CD) is just a small sample of what Stoney can do. If you have the opportunity to catch these guys live, don't miss it."
3,A little disapointing ...,"Nothing real special here. Not bad, but no song, lyric, or solo, really stands out to me. I think I'm always expecting to hear the latest Jimi or SRV. There are better out there to listen to - Bonamassa, Duarte, Popa Chubby to name three."
4,Parachutes by Coldplay,"Music is highly subjective. This recording just struck a chord with me. I give it 4 stars because, I know, I do not know enough about the technical aspects of music composition to rate it as the best all around. It has provided some great sounds for me. I really enjoy it."
4,lovely emotion-packed music,This is a great album to listen to on a snowy Sunday morning. You can really hear the emotion of the song in Chris Martin's voice. My only complaint is why Parachutes is only a 46 seconds.
4,Hmm...,"I would compare Coldplay to a tamer Radiohead. I liked this album a lot, but it got old pretty fast. After listening to the whole thing, the songs started to sound the same. Nevertheless, I wouldn't underestimate the talent of this band."
5,Soaring Through The Sky,"From the opening strings of 'Don't Panic', this is one of the very best debut albums in history. It goes from strength to strength, with 'Shiver' 'Yellow' and 'Trouble' being the standout tracks. It has a beautiful elegaic tone. Its not quite Scottish band Travis, or Irish band U2, it stands on its on right and is destined to be one day the biggest band in the world, once Bono puts down the microphone. I would strongly recommend that you buy it and listen to the whole thing right the way through - it will have you captivated. There may be some tracks that you mightn't be crazy about at first, but they'll grow on you. 'Yellow' is the song that made Coldplay. Chris Martin said that he found it amazing to owe Coldplay's entire career on the 4 and a half minutes of music that is 'Yellow'. Coldplay's music is constantly being used on television shows and movies. And rightly so. They have such amazing, beautiful music."
1,NOT the second coming of Radiohead,"Coldplay have bee compared to early Radiohead, the implication being if you wanted ""The Bends part 2"" instead of Kid A, then these are the boys for you.Don't be fooled! Coldplay are fourth-rate impostors. This CD does not stand the test of repeated plays - I never want to hear ""Yellow"" again!"
1,Junk Lyrics,The music is 'nice' but the lyrics are junk. But most people don't listen to lyrics anyways (see the other reviews).
1,BAH!,"THIS IS DISGUSTING!!!! These guys ought to be ashamed of themselves. Never in my life have I heard such lame songs. The lyrics are incredibly corny, the piano tinkling in the background is pathetic, and the singer's voice could use some help. Trouble is an okay song, but the rest is pure garbage. I hate this more than I hate Norah Jones' new album. Get back to England where ya belong."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful","First let me start out by saying that I absolutely love Travis, Radiohead, and Starsailor. Now, a lot of people will tell you that Coldplay is exactly like them. DON""T LISTEN. Coldplay is very bad. Sure, Yellow is a great song, but for me, that's where it ends. The music is very boring and just...doesn't sound good."
2,Good Copycats!,"I know saying this now might eventually cause a riot, but Coldplay ARE copycats! So are Travis, so are Muse, at least Doves do have some degree of originality and dignity. Everybody is raving about the album now, I've listened to this for a few times, tried to make myself like it. Well, the conclusion is... they are just ripping off Radiohead, not in the same way as Nirvana ripping off the Pixes,but in a way that makes the album sound cheap, maybe(? ) Coldplay will be the next Radiohead, they do make a few good tunes here and there, but NOT NOW! There are just toooooo many 'the next Radiohead' around, Travis, Muse...even Grandaddy(at least they try to make another 'OK Computer' instead of making another 'The Bend') now there is Coldplay. A parade of wannabes. It's time! Radiohead is releasing 'Kid A' soon, the landscape is going to change again!You don't believe? We will see!"
2,Adult Alternative,"I was told that this CD sounds like 'Bends' era Radiohead. I purchased it only having heard 'Don't Panic', which is good. The part about sounding like Radiohead is inaccurate, and despite what people say, they don't sound like Oasis either. Noel Gallagher was right about these guys, they are soft and so is their music. That is ok, but this is no great rock opus as some critics have deemed it. I would recommend 'Don't Panic' and 'Shiver.' But otherwise this is mostly moody, sappy, and tame. The lyrics are at times downright terrible. If you're feeling kind of emo, go for it."
4,Very Enjoyable but far from groundbreaking,"Well with all the hype surrounding the release, not to mention a BIG delay of the domesitic release. (looks like November at the earliest) I broke down and shelled out the import cash for this disc. Believe me I'm glad I did. Fans of everyone from Jeff Buckley, Travis and even Dave Matthews will find things they like about Coldplay. This is a well put together record full of nicely crafted slow tempo, alt/pop tunes. Nice couple of singles in Yellow and Shiver but we've all heard this stuff before. As well as the other gems that really do exsist here. If your looking for a disc to blow you away, as well as justify an import purchase, I'd first get the Doves, ""Lost Souls"" record. A much more complex and far superior release."
4,Great buy,"I am impressed by this album. I only wish I could have gotton my hands on this bands work a little sooner than late December. This particular album reminds me of a couple different artists: Nick Drake, Ben Lee, Innocence Mission (musically), Pink Floyd, Catherine Wheel,and Radiohead (naturally). ""Everything's Not Lost"" is certainly my favorite song on the album- lyrically, instrumentally,and vocally. I would LOVE CW to make a cover of this song! Chris Martin and Rob Dickinson (of CW), have similar sounds to their voices, and I love it! Run to your local record store and buy any Coldplay disc, or discs, you can get your hands on. It meets most of my credentials for a terrific buy!"
2,Snoozefest,"I really wanted to like this record, having loved Coldplay's brilliant second CD, ""A Rush of Blood to the Head."" I've listened to it several times now, and one word keeps coming to mind: Soporific.With the exception of ""Yellow"" and ""Shiver,"" which are fine songs indeed, the rest of the album proceeds at a snail's pace. I fail to see the similarities with Radiohead, whose dynamic and challenging records never sink into the torpor that ails ""Parachutes."" A closer comparison is with Travis' similarly moribund debut, ""The Man Who.""I like mellow artists (c.f. Richard Aschroft, Seal), but there's a fine line between mellow and mind-numbing. Fortunately, Coldplay did learn how to mix things up a bit, and it shows on their next record.I give ""Parachutes"" 2 stars for the two great songs (""Yellow"" and ""Shiver"") which are almost worth the price of admission alone. (Great cover, too)."
2,Disappointment Guaranteed,Radiohead without the emotion. Oasis without the tunes. Mark Knopfler without the lyrics.
3,Coldplay stands on its own...,"There are 1000 bands that sound like 1000 other bands. Sure Coldplay can be picked apart for the bits and pieces of its influences and its borrowed substance... Everyone borrows... Elvis, Zeppelin, Stones, Oasis... the trick is to add enough of yourself into a sound so that what is captured is fresh and complimentary of your roots and yet not larceny.Enjoy this disc for the pure sound and clearity of it... the songlist goes much deeper than the radio hits ""Yellow"" and ""Trouble"". People need to just chill... in this life there is more than enough room for an addition band to praise.Promising and Strong... wanting so much to be alternative but closer in skin to The Sundays.... if not the Carpenters... A great disc."
2,its not the worst album ever,apparatly these are the new rock stars.strange though because i thought rock stars had to rock coldplay on the other don't rock they write slow moving ballads which is fine just not 10 of them.
2,One good song...so it gets two stars,"I bought this CD because Amazon.com stated if your music tastes center around bands like Badly Drawn Boy and Radiohead, then you might like this album. Well, this CD is a far cry from the above mentioned - both of whom are innovative, cutting-edge artists with an individual voice. This band sounds like so many others, it's hard to regard it as anything new. One question if you are considering the purchase of this record: Do you like Dave Matthews voice? If so, I'm sure this one will get you off -"
5,Fabulous,"I bought this album over a year ago, and still find myself wanting to listen to it again and again--it's simply filled with beautiful songs. When I first bought it, I listened to the whole album in one sitting; it seemed slow, (not an album to listen to when you've just had coffee) but I liked most of the songs. A month after that, I took it out of the rack it had been gathering dust in and put it on, learning to love the entire thing bit by bit. It's the type of album that grows on you. It's also one of those that you should listen to on a stormy night while cozy in your house--a definite mood piece. The overall effect of the album is dark, velvety and introspective, even ethereal, at times. ""Sparks"", ""Spies"", ""Trouble"" and ""We Never Change"" are favorites of mine, and ""Yellow"" was the hook that made me love Coldplay in the first place. If you like Doves, Travis, or Radiohead, I highly recommend it."
5,if you like travis,Coldplay created an amazing and unique album here..thats until i heard Travis...whom i also loved...they both are a melencholy band with amazing voices...i found also similar to radiohead. Buy both for your CD collection. I love the songs on this album more and more everytime i listen to it...Shiver has to be my favorite track..a sweet love song that will stick in your head
5,"Beautiful World, Beautiful CD","In an age of fake pop and insincere rhyme-rock, this is an absolute masterpiece. In fact, I dare to say that this would be a masterpiece in any era.If you want to hear and feel current songwriting at it's very best, this is the CD for you. From top to bottom, ""Parachutes"" is an incredible piece of work.Chris Martin pours everything he's got into every song, from heartbreak to happiness, self-doubt to self-understanding. He is surrounded by three other ""professional musicians"" who know how to play, and play well.It is mellow, and perhaps at times a little depressing, but it is as beautiful as fine art in a museum. A true masterwork that will surely become a classic."
4,Better than I thought,"Coldplay's album was very good for a debut. There is a lot of good songwriting present here.The thing that I was most surprised about (and thrilled) is that they do not sound like U2, nor any other artist. There are a lot of unique sounds on here and I believe that they will be a lot better in the future.Dont think that this is the best album of the century, it isnt, but I think that they have a lot of potential. Its very good, no matter how negative I may sound. Its just that its a little too English poppy for me, but if you like the Travis type of sound, this is one of the best albums of the year.I can reccomend this to basically anyone and their tour this summer promises one of the best ever. (They are touring with Grandaddy, who is exellent)"
4,"Buy me, you won't be sorry","I am good, you should buy me. Trust me. I know what I'm talking about. There are lots of lousy albums out there, but I am not one of them. You see, I have some marvelous songs on me. Yeah, I contain the smashing song ""Yellow,"" which is starting to get played too much. (The upside is that radio stations are playing less vomitous bile...) But I also boast the rocking guitar of ""Shiver,"" the dreamy melodies of ""Spies"" and the tight instrumentation of ""Don't Panic."" ""Sparks"" is mellow and haunting. So clicky clicky and buy me."
5,music at its most beautiful,"when i first heard Yellow, i was immediately interested in buying the cd to see where else this group could take me. After listening to the full Parachutes cd, i was completely amazed at its earnest and true sound. The vocals can actually make your heart melt and cause it to skip a beat. The guitars almost float on air in the background. Now, the comparisons to Radiohead are valid, but its everything that is calm and serene about Radiohead...not the bang-out-loud explosions that we've come to expect at the most unexpected turn. Buy this cd, stake claim to this group, you wont regret it. Hopefully they wont become the next Oasis."
5,best debut almbum in the past 20 years,coldplay is one of the only real bands out there that still makes real music. parachutes was their debut album and it was by far the most groundbreaking album for any band in the past 20 years.
5,Champion!,"Coldplay is the cat's pyjamas!! This is a craker of an album, it's absolutly brilliant & I highly recommend!"
2,not a great example of brit rock,"after listening to this album a few times....and hearing ""yellow"" on the radio one too many times...I've about given up on this album...it consistently becomes a whining blur as you attempt to listen...not the ""next big thing"" everyone raved about."
4,Solid pop,"Everyone compares this singer to Thom Yorke of Radiohead, but frankly, he sounds more like Dave Matthews to me. Doesn't matter, I like Dave Matthews fine and I like Coldplay fine too. The track ""Spies"" grabbed me right away and the rest of it is quickly growing on me. Bravo."
4,Flight Without Parachutes,"First of all about Coldplay, Coldplay's music is from the alternative/indie variety following from such an artisit as Oasis but I must say that it is far from the type of music which Oasis play with more of a gentle approach and not as fast paced as say 'Roll With It' but more like Noel Gallagher's rendition. There songs are quite simular with not much change in variables of the music but it is there first album and the music is still of a highest quality.I would buy the album because of the excellence and many top-notch tunes such as Yellow and the fantastic Trouble which I must say is one of the best tunes of 2000.Overall, the album doesn't have much variety but is fantastic and I'm sure that Coldplay will keep improving in there music and will shine above the rest into the new year."
2,Gets old really really fast,"I admit to being one of the people to give Parachutes a great review at first, after having listened to and becoming slightly infatuated with the CD. The novelty soon wore off though. While at first songs like Yellow are easy to get caught in and sing along to, below the pretty surface, there isn't much substance. The lyrics are really almost nonsensical. The whole CD has the feeling of one terrificly long, dragging song, with the same sweetly melancholy guitars and sappy lyrics about all the trials and tribulations of love. This music is very non demanding and easily slips into the background, going unnoticed. Chris Martin uses the same tone of voice and style of singing in every song, and really demonstrates the saying ""Difference makes a difference."" For better bands within the same general genre of Coldplay, I would check out Flickerstick, an underrated band not many people have heard of, Live, Seven Mary Three, etc."
5,astounding and haunting,"This is an album you will play and play over and over again. If this is their first album,... what will their 2nd sound like? The vocals are haunting - just check out the song ""Spies"" - and the music is melodious and flowing. This CD is new, fresh, and wonderful...there is nothing I can think of to compare it to. And by the way, it's a LOT better than Kid A, and that's from a huge Radiohead fan."
4,MOVING STUFF,"PARACHUTES IS AN ALBUM WORTH OWNING..OR BORROWING FROM A FRIEND...OR DOWNLOADING OFF THE INTERNET...OR ""BORROWING"" FROM A RECORD STORE..YOU GET THE PICTURE. ""YELLOW"" AND ""TROUBLE"" ARE THE 2 HIGHLIGHTS. I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE PIANO PLAYING ON ""TROUBLE"". THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF SONGS HERE THAT QUALIFY AS FILLER. I REALLY HOPE THESE GUYS BLOW UP IN 02."
5,Good stuff,"This cd is REFRESHING to say the least. I bought this cd...really not even LOVING the song Yellow. I thought Yellow was this okay sounding song...but wow. I popped the cd into my cd player...and i was REALLY blown away. I found the sounds and the riffs SO amazing. Really...this cd is great.And I AM a true Radiohead fan. Although i found Kid A to be SO dissapointing (when compared to OK computer), i still DO think that Coldplay captures a lot of Radiohead's sound--not completely...but it sounds like Coldplay was HEAVILY influenced.So...if you like Radiohead's sound...DEF. buy this cd"
5,Great,"I just bought this record and have to say that it lives up to all Ive heard about it. It's glorious, and thats the word that keeps popping to mind. The only other records I've discovered lately that are equal are Grandaddy and Sensefield."
3,Serene Rock,"Parachutes is the perfect album to listen to when it is raining outside. It is the kind of cd that uplifts your spirits. Very different then rockbands like Aerosmith and Disturbed. Coldplay is more neutral. Maybe in a way it is like ""The Eagles."" It does not shake your spirits but rather soothes you. The relaxing guitar combined with the vocals calls for cool contemplation. I particuliarly like the song ""Yellow."""
4,not bad,"i really enjoy listening to this band. they did well and are extremely talented. i recommend it to ppl, but then again it really depends on ppl's taste"
5,Seriously.... a classic,"This is one of those albums that you hear and every time it moves to another song... you are like holy crap... this is on this album also??this is the type of album you put on when friends are over and you all reminisce about the times where you were in college, chilling out over a few beverages and wishing your finals were over.hard to go wrong with speed of sound or yellow... i mean he wrong it about gweneth."
5,Genius! I loved it!,"wow this is a great cd! it has a strong guitar in it, but it feels amazingly serene.. one of those things thats good to listen to after a stressful day at school or work. this is a truely genius record and i cant wait until theyre second album arrives at my door!"
5,An excellent debut,"Sometimes, you can't avoid writing those clone-ish 5 star reviews you see endlessly on every page with such impressive music. Parachutes is an exception, and is a unique album. The music melodic, it is light and it takes time to get used to. But once you discover the magic of Coldplay, you will discover the meaning of poignant and effective music."
3,Nothing to write home about,"Mellow music is always harder for me to get into. Some bands, however, have been able to excite despite their calmness, such as Radiohead and Pedro The Lion. Coldplay is close to being one of those bands. Songs such as ""Shiver"" (great riff!) and ""Yellow"" are poppy and soaring, with a bit of a U2 feel. Throughout the album, guitar and vocals shine. But when it's all said and done, a lot of these tracks are boring, dragging melodies out too long and stumbling about for a while. More focus in songwriting could produce some amazing work."
4,"Good, Different",It a nice change from popular music. The whole CD is slower and not like anything you hear on the radio. Very relaxing.
4,Groovy,"I really liked the ""Yellow"" single (reminded me of Dave Matthews Band except not as sophomoric) but ""Don't Panic"" was what made me buy the album. I'm really glad I did. Simple and thoughtful. Radiohead-lite comparisions are apt and not insulting, and it even reminds me a little of Nick Drake. I listen to it several times in a row before switching CDs."
4,Impressive Debut from the Boys from London,Coldplay's Parachutes was one the best albums to come out of Britan last year. As a result of their impressive debut they have forged quite a name for themselves in Britan and countries like Australia where their album has enjoyed considerable success.I bought the album last July in Australia . Most people myself included originally purchased the album for the song yellow. However what you get is so much more. Chris Martin's emotionally charged voice makes some beautiful music. From the start of Don't Panic to the end of Everything's not lost you are taken on an emotional journey into love and relationships. I hope the next album can meet the high expectations of the first.
5,Coldplay is AMAZING!,"In my opinion, I think this album is way better than a rush of blood to the head (not that I don't love that cd as well)...I love his laid back melodies which have a different aura to them then most of the tracks on rush of blood to the head. 'Don't Panic, Shiver, Sparks, Trouble and Parachutes' are just awesome...I cannot even begin to put my finger on what makes this band so great. This CD just makes me happy! I definetly would recommend this to anyone who likes Coldplay and just went to pick up rush of blood to the head... if you're interested in coldplay this cd is well worth the money."
4,"Not as good as the other Coldplay albums, but still good.","This was the second album I bought and it's not as good as A Rush of blood to the head. The best song is ""Yellow"", That song beats all the other songs by far. But I also like ""Don't Panic"", ""Spies"", ""Trouble"", ""High Speed"" and ""We Never Change."" And I hope this review was helpful to you."
5,GREAT,"If you do anything for yourself ever, buy this CD. It is beautiful, intricate, and simple all at once. It is music that calms, excites, and amazes all at once. BUY IT!"
5,A Debut Shouldn't Be This Good!,"Normally a band's first album has a few good songs and a bunch of leftovers making up the rest of the disc. It takes a truly special group to produce a complete CD the first time around. And that's exactly what Parachutes is.Many of you will look at this CD and judge it solely for ""Yellow"" (I've heard Parachutes called ""Yellow and Eleven Other Songs"" before!), but each song has its merit and holds its place. Two years on, and of all the discs in my collection, this is the one that I come back to and rediscover consistently every couple of months.I'd have to count ""We Never Change"", ""Don't Panic"" and ""Everything's Not Lost"" as my favourites, but I could almost say that about all of them. To produce a bunch of songs like this on the first try is testament to Coldplay's talent."
5,Another Brilliant Band from the UK,"I don't how Britain does it but that country keeps churning out great artists and bands like PJ Harvey, Radiohead, Badly Drawn Boy and now Coldplay. I see that some of the reviewers here have compared Coldplay with the likes of Travis and Radiohead. I must say that this band sounds nothing like Travis and Radiohead. Coldplay is a band of it's own entity. Of course I bought this cd because of the song ""Yellow"" but I quickly found out just how great the rest of the cd is."
2,Not Worth the Expense,"Bought the CD because I liked ""Yellow"". Listened to the other tracks and was surprisingly disappointed. The short songs with depressing lyrics are not worth the expense."
4,"Great, but mellow.","I would have given this CD a 4 1/2, but there's no 4 1/2, and it's not quite a 5, so there you go. I think this is a great CD. It's really exciting to see a new band put out something this good. You are probably familiar with the song Yellow, and you should be forewarned that the rest of the CD is much more mellow and low-key, because if you bought it thinking the other songs would also have alot of electric guitar, you may be dissapointed. You will find some in Shiver, which is my favorite on the CD, but not in most of the others. This is a passionately sung album, and the musicianship is outstanding. My other favorites are Don't Panic and Trouble(nice piano). None of the tracks stand out as annoying. Like a great album should, it all flows. I think you'll be happy with it. I'm not a big CD collector, but I broke down and bought this one and I love it."
3,A Mixed Bag,"After hearing the song Yellow numerous times on the radio, I felt compelled to purchase this album. I definately wasn't expecting a hard rock album, though I definately wasn't expecting something as mellow as Parachutes. There is really nothing exceptional I can say about this album. When you're hearing the same monotone songs over and over again it's hard to pick out any one thing. However, there is something about this CD that grabbed me. All of the songs are gorgeous and the production is solid. I do not think that this is a great album, but it's certainly better than most of the [stuff] out there today."
5,Beautiful,"What a beautiful album! This is truly a CD for anyone who is a music lover. Perfect for driving with the windows down on a warm summer day. Track 6 ""Trouble"" is particularly enchanting. This CD is a must have. The amazing vocals and haunting sounds of piano are a real treat."
5,we never change,"I can say that this is my favorite album ever so far in my life. I have listened to A Rush... and it just doesn't get to me as much as this one does. A rush is to incoherent, they're good songs on there but parachutes flows so nicely. It is more simple than A rush, and sometimes simple is better. Is it just me or is 'We Never Change' the best song ever! The song is so chill and so down. Personly I don't know why people are more on to it. It's better than any track on A Rush including the scientist. 'Sparks', 'Don't Panic', and 'High Speed' are greatly unappreciated. Relax and let these songs take you. The whole theme of wanting to sort out life through relaxing songs just makes this album absolutely perfect. A Rush may be good but Parachutes is better and it's where it all started."
2,Ratings police,"Its unfair that people only rate the albums they love and every single album has 4.5 stars at least. I'm making an conscious effort to review some albums I don't like an I absolutly hate this one. The first 2 songs are good, the rest is terrible, period. Hey, at least thats more than Travis can say."
2,"a soso album,definitely not as strong as OKComputer and KIDA","It's an OK album, but definitely not the best. Maybe spies is the only good song inside the album, others are just so-so."
3,yellow undeniable,"""Yellow"" got major radio play her in san francisco and it's not hard to guess why--it's an undeniably awesome song, beautiful, majestic, soaring, etc. had to rate this only 3 stars though as the rest of the record doesn't quite match up, and in a way, Coldplay are easy to get just a tad tired of. the new Radiohead is much deeper, the new CD by the black watch is much more spinetinglingly inspiring, and the new dandy warhols is much more fun."
2,Overrated,"This is the greatest CD you will ever hear, nor the worst. The fact is, it isn't that memorable. Yellow, the song you have heard on the radiostations for the past few weeks, is the hilight of the album, so don't expect much more. They sound like they're trying to be radiohead, but less original and therefore less effective. Don't waste your money."
2,Coldplay/Coldfish,"I, too, was lured in by the glowing reviews by others, but was disappointed. These guys need some Wheaties. The music is limp and the lead vocals are anemic. The band just sounds tired, like they will never be able to muster the strength to really play. It's all kind of morose sounding, too. Not even cheerful pop."
5,Mood Music.... So Good,"Okay, so Chris Martin sounds like he's the son of Jim Morrison, no doubt. But what a tight band, in general! I picked up this one after I had enjoyed a few later releases so much, and I am happy to say that I've enjoyed this one as much as any. They're so gooood! :)"
2,impossible for them to live up to the hype,ok yes i they do have something but they dont live up to the hype if this album was less hyped i may be giving it at least a 3 but since this band has been so hyped up i have been kind to give it 2 because of the hype of this album this ends up seeming like a half arsed effort steer well clear unless youve never heard of them
5,Great Album,"Wow. I love this album. I like it better than their second. There seems to be more of an honest passion here. They were very young when they wrote this album, and I am impressed with their insite, and the song's melodies. Chris, though a bit nasily, has a listenable voice. I heard clips of their 3rd album, and it sounds like Clocks part 2. I just really love parachutes, and I am amazed at the people who have a rush of blood to the head, but don't have this one. Parachutes is just mellow and nice. Every song is really good. Ironically, ""yellow"" was there most popular song, and probably my least favorite. So, for those of you who are new to Coldplay, or just have a Rush of Blood To The Head, you are in for a treat!"
4,Decent album,If you enjoy coldplay's other musical works then you will also likely enjoy this album as well. Worth the price.
4,Classic Album,Parachutes has been out now for over 10 years and it is still relevant. Great album from top to bottom.
4,Moody,"I find that whether or not I like this album depends on my mood. For me, this album is best listened to at night... I mostly listen to CDs while driving, and for some reason this music seems much better in the dark, than during daylight hours. Perhaps it is the moodiness and introspection of the lyrics which best plays as a soundtrack to slower times than during the rush of work and errands."
4,"Ignore ""A music fan"" and his hate","I just read the hateful ""review"" by 'A music fan'. I'm surprised that people with nothing but hate are allowed to review at Amazon. Parachutes is a sublime record, and that is coming from someone who loves Metallica, Fear Factory, Killswitch Engage, SYL, Emperor, and many more metal bands. I also love great music from other genres. Stop the Brit bashing from fools like 'A music fan', and enjoy this for the great rock record it is."
2,The album is awesome; the vinyl has issues,"There are other people here who have done a good job reviewing the songs on this album... so I won't waste time with that. I will say that I ordered the Vinyl (brand new) of this album and when I received it I noticed that it would skip pretty badly on two different songs. So I submitted an exchange request from Amazon and the second album showed up 2 days later. The replacement record didn't have the same issues on the two original songs, but DOES have a skipping issue on one of the other songs.It seems very strange that 2 out of 2 records that I ordered have this skipping issue, so I am led to believe that they simply did a lazy job creating these records. Shame, as it's a great album with some awesome memories tied to the songs."
5,Look at the stars,"This is one of the best albums around, all of the songs are provocative and fascinating. Coldplay's rise to fame from UK to America has been amazing, and they have many great single imports that are just as great. This acoustical sound is pleasant and unique. The lyrics are amazing, and all of the songs, from the extremely short but powerful Parachutes to the haunting Trouble, are excellent. Here is a band that will achieve greatness."
5,One of the best albums of 2000,"I first heard about this album on a U2 message board and went right out and bought it. I was blown away by the terrific music coming from a band's first album. Chris Martin's incredible vocals were definitely a stand out for me. ""Shiver"" has a great buildup, ""Yellow"" is a fantastic romantic song, and ""High Speed"" stuck out right away. The rest of the album is also great and I can't wait for the band's second album."
4,"""turn it in to something beautiful""","Well, it seems that brief, shining moment of the first wave of British shoegazer pop is paying huge dividends. Coldplay is definitely influenced by now-defunct bands like Ride, My Bloody Valentine, and Lush, but they make their own mark here on ""Parachutes."" It is a perfect antidote to what passes for pop these days. There is something powerful about simply played songs about lost love and fading hope that becomes moving when a band of romantics with a few distortion pedals put their heads together. To its own modest degree Coldplay help reclaim territory ceded to genre music (Latin, teen pop, and pseudo-metal) by the bursts of guitar overdrive of 'Yellow,' the shimmer of Don't Stop,"" and just about every other track. An album to listen to alone over and over and over...."
4,Not Quite the Speed of Sound,"I bought this album for the song ""Yellow"". At first I didn't like the album and it got shoved to the bottom of my cd collection. Later I dug it back out and forced myself to listen to it. Now I really like it. I listen to it when I'm tired or depressed. I've also been known to use it occasionally with my yoga practice. ""Yellow"" is still my favorite song on this album, but I've learned how to listen to this cd as a whole. If you're fond of Coldplay you definately need this cd, but it different than Rush of Blood to the Head and very different from X&Y."
3,no surprising,"Coldplay is but an ordinary brit-pop band with some beautiful& catchy melodies like the songs "" yellow""&""sparks"",but other tracks are all too familiar.they can't be compared to Radiohead which is a lengend due to Thom Yorke."
2,Just a bunch of words put together.,"Most of the songs on this album sound like a bunch of words put together to fill up space. Take for example, the hit song 'Yellow'. ""I wrote a song for you, and its called Yellow."" What the heck is that supposed to mean? Most of the songs are dreary and lifeless. Just because the lead singer sounds like he is in pain, doesn't mean that he is. Just listen to the lyrics and you'll realize how silly the songs are."
2,COLDPLAY IS A CLONE,"Is it just me or does Coldplay remind you just a little bit too much of Travis? The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because there is only 2 good songs on it 1-Don't Panic, 2-Yellow, the rest of the album is just pretty much filler. There was so much hype surrounding the release of Parachutes that I just had to go out and see what all this commotion was about for myself. Also forget all those comparisons being made to Radiohead, Coldplay is not even remotely close to being mentioned in the same breath as Radiohead. If you are looking for something to tide you over until some new Travis material arrives then I suggest this album. Otherwise don't bother, this is a very unoriginal and sappy album, I hope that Coldplay one day find there own identity and sound and then maybe, just maybe you could mention them in the same sentence with the likes of Radiohead."
3,"Catchy songs, but what's with the spiders?","I kinda like this CD, and I know that I'm not supposed to listen to the lyrics of pop, but I think these guys had some kind of psychic trauma involving spiders. Or maybe the spiders are just a metaphor for how many times the singer messes up and has to apologize through the medium of song. (I guess it works since his audience keeps letting him mess up again and again.)Maybe I'm missing the irony, but it seems to me that if more than 50% of the album is devoted to apologizing... well, people who just apologize all the time aren't very sincere.Other than that, the sound is pretty generic by the third track. The songs are pretty, but there's not a whole lot of breadth here.... but for pop music, it's not too terrible."
1,Get a new singer.....please!!!!!,"The songs are good, the music well done and the lyrics are cool. BUT....this guy has to be the absolute worst singer I have EVER heard! I really tried to listen to all the songs, and tried to like it. I just couldn't get past his completely tone-deaf voice. He reminds me of a bad karaoke singer. Do yourself a favor and avoid this bad attempt at singing if you can, and wait for them to hire someone that can hit a note."
1,is that the fave band of Justin timberlake?,"is that the fave band of him? the band has already to take a pause for one year until 2005! because not only the lead singer gets married but he worries that the fans will be getting bored with them all.PS: that's why the dino hard rocking bands like Zeppelin, deep purple, uriah heep, sabbath who are still able to continue their golden ages since the last 33 years, and the fans are still loving them until today. But the new youngster like Coldplay?? they just started their career for 3 years ago?? and they want to stop now?? it is a wonderful shame!!"
1,Dave Matthews Rip Off!!!,"What a sham. Isn't anyone original anymore? Coldplay is just another cookie cutter mainstream wannabe. The lead singer's embarrassing attempt to emulate his vocals from Dave Matthews immediately tells me that this band lacks the guts to create anything original and progressive... If you're still looking to buy this album, wait two months since this last Coldplay ""gem"" is headed straight for the bargain bin."
2,Music is OK but lyrics are horrible.,"I have listened to this album about 5 times now and I don't think I can listen to it anymore. This band has about the dumbest, most trite, awful lyrics I've ever heard. Dave Matthews has better lyrics, and theirs don't even make sense half the time.Here are some sample lyrics from ""Yellow"":I came alongI wrote a song for youAnd all the things you doAnd it was called yellowWow, very deep. The song was called Yellow? OH MY GOD, that's the same name as this song? Holy crap. He should have called the song Bellow."
1,"Admitedly, I've only heard one song off of this CD.","I've heard the song Yellow many times on the radio. Based on that, here is my impression of Coldplay: They really really REALLY love Pavement.EDITED 8/28/2001:I just heard a second song on the radio, Shiver. Therefore, I must re-write my review: They really really really really REALLY REALLY love Pavement. Just buy Pavement's Slanted & Enchanted instead. You'd be buying the original instead of a facsimile."
4,Coldplay Rocks!,"ok, i bought this cause the bands cute and cause i like the song yellow (it was also kind of an impulse buy) but it was so worth it. i really like it. the only down side is that after you listen to for a long time everything starts to sound the same. its really quality music though and totaly enjoyable."
4,"""We live in a beautiful world"".","I remember hearing ""Yellow"" on a plane home from Ireland in 2000, and knowing that when I got home I would get the cd. There is obviously something special about ""Coldplay"", and when Chris Martin sings, you can feel it in your head and your heart. I can understand the comparisons to ""U2"", ""Starsailor"", and ""Radiohead"", because the music really is passionate and emotional. Other popular songs are ""Shiver"", and the gorgeous ""Trouble"", but I also like ""Don't Panic"" and ""High Speed"" just as much. Overall an amazing debut. The only thing more impressive than this album, is that ""Coldplay"" followed it with an even better one."
4,A great album,"I picked up this album in France simply because there was a reference to Radiohead on the sticker. I was hooked the first time I listened to it. But yes, sometimes it seems like they are trying to sound like Radiohead but their music is great in a different way. I would suggest this to anyone who likes moody British rock without a lot of thinking involved. It is definitely one of my favorites for this year."
4,the best music of today,"Cold play is probably the best band out today, This band is better than maybe some of its influences such as radio head, the songs are all meaning full and are easliy related to, Martin singing style is outstanding and if anything gives and eiry resembles to rodger waters on the final cut and some of more haunting pink floyd songs, its to me the only music that honest and real today, this album is outstanding and is good to relax to definatly anyone who likes music and or is looking for something differnt or is interested in cold play but not sure about them should definatly consider this album and rush of blood to the head, cold play isn't a band thats generaly on the tv or on the radio as far as i know, but to me that means one thing, that means that there FREAKIN awsome."
5,Smooth and Satisfying,"This is a beautiful CD that's perfect enough for five stars. It's not as great as ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"", but it achieves its own greatness in its precise manipulation of mood. The title, ""Parachutes"", is perfect for its breezy feel, while the hit single, ""Yellow"", sounds just like the color would sound if it were a song. This CD is just one example of Coldplay's untouchable genius."
5,Deeply affecting and heartfelt,"Back in 2000 Colplay managed to release an amazing pop and rock record - amazingly their first . "" Parachutes "" stands out from all other recent music releases for having as much feeling as it does . "" Yellow "" is the perfect cd-single while the rest of the tracklist , although mostly lo-fi ballads , is undeniably striking . From the melancholic quality of "" Don't Panic "" ( "" All all that i know / there's nothing here to run from ..."" ) to the tender sadness of "" High Speed "" this is first-class songwritting for one's soul searching moments . Ofcourse a basic element behind the group's magic is Chris Martin's bittersweet , beautiful perfomances . For a band as talented and famous as they are , Coldplay have adopted a humble public image and kind manners and they deserve credit for that . They seem to focus only on the important stuff which is creating good music ."
5,Extraordinary Debut,"Coldplay exploded onto the scene in 2000 with one of the most remarkable debut albums of the last few decades. Parachutes grabs you from the very opening chords of 'Don't Panic', and you're immediately hooked. Followed by 'Shiver' which is a dazzling and exhilarating tribute to relationship frustration. Each track on this album is brilliant, from the most rocking moments in 'Shiver', to the melodic nature of 'High Speed', and the bittersweet tones of 'Everything's Not Lost'. It is an album that will have you reeling in amazement, and you will find it difficult to remove from your cd player. A definite must have."
5,Inescapable,"This is truly a brilliant pop/rock record. The guitar melodies are intelligently written and delivered with skill. The vocals are intriguing and compelling. The lyrics are not overly heavy but not completely meaningless-just right for a pop record. The hooks are great, too; you'll find yourself singing along sooner than you want to. Over a year after its release, this CD still regularly finds its way into my car's CD player, rebirthing itself every few months or so. ""Parachutes"" is a rare achievement, an inescapable recording that seems it will never get old."
5,Heartfelt and Beautiful! A stunning release!,"'Parachutes' is hauntingly beautiful music, to say the least! In fact, this release, and 'After Everything Now This' by The Church, are the 2 most touching and stylistically beautiful sublime releases i've heard in a long time! If you are dissapointed with today's music scene in general, and feel that there is not much quality music being composed, you MUST check these two out. They are highly musical, highly emotional, and highly gorgeous! 'Parachutes' and 'After Everything Now This' by The Church are incredible. If you are into 'Radiohead', check out these two and expand your horizons some more."
2,Unfulfilled Potential,"With the exception of Yellow, which is a wonderful pop song, I found the album to be an overall disappointment. It is better than a lot of crap in the market. However, the reason why listening to this album is excruciating is that you can hear that they have the potential to put out an excellent album. Unfortunately, they try too hard to tread the thin line between pop and serious music and don't quite pull it off. Most of the songs would have sounded better if they had held back on their guitar flourishes or if they had gone full blast as they did with Yellow.I do look forward to hearing future releases to see if they do meet their potential, but for now I find their debute disappointing."
5,One of the best!,"This is one of the best CDs that I have heard by a group from the ""post-boomer"" rock generation. Excellent acoustic rock and lyrics -- this is a great listen! Too bad there are no lyrics inside the CD, though. Coldplay -- keep the good stuff comin' -- we'll keep buying the CDs!"
2,I am missing the point I guess,I expected more substance from an album with the rave reviews and awards. Instrumental accompaniment is worth 2 stars and honorable mention but simple sing-song melodies with simplistic lyrics don't hold my attention. Comparisons to Radiohead are appropriate because I can't figure out what the attraction is with them either.
1,"If I could give it zero stars, I would.","I never buy cd's. Do you know why? You take a big chance on not liking them and then you can't return them. Parachutes is no exception. This is an example of one good song and the rest is filler. After ""Yellow"" the rest of the cd is just one long, boring, slow, drone after another. All of the songs sound exactly alike and no. 7 is 20 seconds long. Spend your money on something else. I'm amazed at how good the other reviews are. They must have been written by...or the band."
1,Over-rated dirge,"I can't believe the hype this clone of where Radiohead WERE is getting. This type of thing is clogging the UK 'alternative' scene with its tame and unemotional whines and passionless vocals, and is probably the main reason most kids listen to Steps or Craig David over here now, at least those styles have some life to them. Muse, JJ72 and Coldplay all pale next to true classics by the likes of Nick Drake, and Radiohead themselves. This is so overblown its unlistenable,a nd has nothing at its heart."
2,Don't Belive the Hype,"The most overrated album of the year. It is in no way deserving of all the high marks. I remember listening to it at the record store and thinking that it didn't really grab me. But I thought, ""Everybody says it's really good, maybe it'll grow on me."" I should have trusted my instinct. Except for ""Shiver"" and ""Yellow"", it's just dull, mediocre at best. I can't believe people compare them to Radiohead."
1,The soundtrack to a snail race.,"Wow, this is really dull music! I thought Radiohead was dull, but this makes Radiohead sound like Iron Maiden! I can't imagine how anyone can even listen to this, it sounds like Dave Matthews on Codine. I strongly caution anyone who operates heavy machinery to not listen to this album, it could be dangerous. Don't listen to it while driving either. {a few lines of ""Yellow"" pop to mind; dozes off and hits keyboard face first}rekhtdhykrehjdkflhdfh...huh? Okay, I'm awake now. Do not buy this album, it is beyond mind-numbing. The only practical use for it is for insomniacs who need help sleeping, and don't want to take pills. This should get you sleeping soundly."
1,Bleh,"Sorry all you hip, fashionable, Colplay fans -- but this CD sucks. It's lackluster, banal, boring, and pretentious.You might like this album if: (1) you're an ultra-sophisticated fratboy (or girl) unwinding after a long night, (2) you're trying to fall asleep, or (3) you're not quite ready to enjoy Radiohead, but ""Hey! This Coldplay is really cool!""Save your money. Try Lamb of God instead."
1,You've got to be Kidding!,"I read the reviews and then I listened to the samples. If this is ""great"" music then I'm a bow-legged octopus. This is boring folk-rock at it's best. I cannot believe what's being passed on as ""talent"" nowadays. And to characterize this as ""perfect"" is stretching common sense and rationality to their very limits."
1,Parachutes,"I was very disappointed with the purchase. The seller described the product to be in ""like new condition"". I anticipated receiving the disc in the original packaging (along with the cover)as though it were purchased brand new from a store. The disc itself was in fine condition. However, it came in a clear plastic case. I don't think the cd should have been advertised as being in ""like new condition."" The music by Coldplay is great and the disc is definitely worth purchasing, particularly if you like all of their other cd's but don't own this one."
5,Coldplay - A Surreal Trip,"When I first heard the song Yellow on the radio, I was very taken by it. I decided that the CD Parachutes was worth my time and money. After purchusing it, I was shocked and delighted to find that many of the songs had a more dramatic sound to them than Yellow. I found that, though they had a sound similar to Radiohead in some instances, they were a very unique band indeed. Many of the songs take you on a journey far beyond where you are, as you listen to the CD. I expecially enjoy Sparks hauntingly gorgeous melody, and the lovely lyrics. Spies is another of my favorites. As you listen to it, you can feel the emotion and feeling in the singer's voice. I find it to be an extrodinarily resplendent song. Never, in all my life, have I heard such mind-blowing, beautiful music. I believe this CD is well worth your money."
4,Let's not rain on Coldplay's parade,"Alright, as I'm sure many people did, I first saw/heard Coldplay from the ""Yellow"" video on mtv2. My first thought when Chris's voice went so high was,""That sounds sort of like Thom Yorke."" I saw the video a couple more times, downloaded ""Don't Panic,"" and then bought ""Parachutes.""Is Coldplay Radiohead? No. But is Coldplay *anyone*? The answer is also no. Coldplay's music is very unique. At first, I listened to the album and thought to myself,""These lyrics are stupid...every song sounds the same,"" that sort of thing; but the more you listen to it the more you hear all of the acoustics, and the more Chris's voice grows on you. The album in itself is very impressive. It's not a rock opera, but it does keep the same mood throughout.Don't buy this album because it's supposed to be the next ""The Bends."" Buy it because it's the first ""Parachutes."""
4,Not all Yellow,"If you liked Travis, The Man Who, you'll be pleased to have bought this album. Also, there are moments when you'll think Jeff Buckley is back in the land of the singing. In the UK, the single 'Yellow' has had so much airplay its almost wearing out - but there's more to Coldplay than one (or even four) hit singles. I must admit I found the lyrics to Yellow a bit trite on the radio, but in the company of the other nine tracks on this album, the song has a new freshness and genuineness to it. In fact, genuine is a good word to describe the whole album. It has aspirations to be great rock, but it never sounds pretentious. There's no doubt that this will be quite a few people's 'album of the year'."
2,Frighteningly overrated,"I actually owned this CD at one time, right at the beginning of 2001. I can't remember why (it wasn't ""Yellow""). I guess they sort of fit into a style that I was into at the time -- call it winsome alt-rock. I really gave it an effort, tried to like it. But, I soon woke up and realized that this band and their album are pretty lame. It's not that they're terrible, and admittedly they're better than most of what's played on the radio. But there are so many similar new bands that are more talented and inventive than Coldplay: the Delgados, the Doves, Kingsbury Manx, Wheat, Creeper Lagoon.... to name a few.Oh, and just one more thing. Coldplay sound NOTHING like Radiohead! I don't know where people get that impression! Both singers have kinda high-pitched voices-- THAT'S IT. Radiohead is about a hundred times better than Coldplay, so obviously someone's not paying close enough attention."
2,Coldplay just feels cold and (almost) lifeless.,"I wanted to like this CD, as they seem to be the at the forefront of Alternative Rock these days; so I picked up the CD...listened...waited for something exciting to make me go ""WOW!""...listed...waited some more...listened.... I made it to the end of the CD...but really no ""WOW"". This is passable music...perhaps best left to the elevator.If you want Alternative Rock to make you go ""WOW!"", skip Coldplay, then get ""Girls Can Tell"" by SPOON. Each song is melodic, good basic guitar & drums, and unique unto the other songs."
2,Filler,"I honestly do not understand the Coldplay phenomenon. Chris Martin has taken Radiohead's ""High & Dry"" off of the Bends album and made an entire sound off of that one song. There is a major difference between being influenced by someone, and making music that is a direct copy of music made 10 years ago. Coldplay is insanely stale, the only reason I gave this album 2 stars rather than 1 is due to the sheer fact that ""Don't Panic"" and ""Trouble"" are not half bad. The rest of this album grates my nerves. It's a piss-poor attempt to be the next Radiohead, as are the other subsequent albums. As said before, this is Radiohead-Lite."
5,What a debut!!!,"There is little doubt in my mind that Coldplay are going to rule the world of music in the near future. No, this is not an exageration - their debut album really is that good. Smooth guitar playing, amazing vocals, clever lyrics and exceptionally catchy melodies all help to propel this album forward leaving a calm and relaxing atmosphere in it's wake. With summer anthems such as 'Shiver', successful singles such as 'Yellow', and smooth tracks such as 'Trouble' and 'High Speed' all confined to this 10 track masterpiece, it wets the mouth with anticipation to think of the possibility (please!!!) of a follow up album. Anyone who has bought this album already will tell you how good it is - easily my album of the year, and I don't think anything will beat it! A 'must have' for anyones CD collection!"
1,Unbelievably bad sound quality,"I purchased 4 different Coldplay CDs and the sound quality on all 4 is abysmal.Save the shipping, save the space. There is literally no downside to buying this as an .mp3."
5,This is a fantastic cd,"I must say that this is really one of my favorite cds of all time. I even had to buy another copy recently because I played out the first one I got in 2001. That's a lot of listening, if you can imagine. I really like Coldplay because I feel like listening to them really prepared me for the music I listen to now. Radiohead is now a favorite of mine in addition to Coldplay, of course. Coldplay is an easier-to-listen-to, toned down version of Radiohead, in my opinion. So if you like Coldplay, definitely try out Radiohead's ""The Bends"". Still, no matter what, I would and always will prefer ""Parachutes""."
5,Heralding the Arrival of Superstars,"Coldplay, simply, is about as close as we're ever going to come to another U2. They don't have quite the social consciousness or lyrical consistency (at least yet), but they have the best singer and the most creative guitarist to bring their music across the pond since the Irish rockers. Direct and poignant without Radiohead's slight tendency towards a condescending tone, Coldplay offers a varied musical landscape rife with cranking guitars, ringing pianos, gospel choirs and soaring strings in astonishingly effective packages. One never gets the sense that the arrangements are overdone or even close to getting out of hand. The only thing missing from this album is more vocal harmony, but one can see why - what harmonist could ever complement Chris Martin? His voice is out of this world, with all the soul of Jeff Buckley, the drive of Thom Yorke, and better pitch and control to boot. This band will do great things."
3,Was nice,"From an average point, of view...it was alright. but could of been more positive...with more depth ! It wasn't full of the magnetism, that I was looking forward to hear."
5,Coldplay at their best,"This CD reminds me of middle school, which ages me a bit. I love Coldplay and their (at the time) very unique sound. I enjoy the entire CD and prefer it to some of their newer stuff"
4,Excellent album,"The two extra tracks are worth it. Obvious parallels can be drawn to bands like Travis, but I think this album can stand on its own."
4,6 MIXES ALL LISTED HERE:,"1. Rhythm Mix 3:47 more Urban sounding2. E. Plugg Jeep Mix 4:39 more Hip-Hop sounding3. Love Me Mix 4:36 more Hip-Hop sounding.4. 20 Fingers Club Mix 7:05 uptempo House mix5. Armand's Funky Foam Mix 8:05 minimal vocal/muisic, heavy beats6. Late Night Mix 5:45 as the mix name says - very bedroom, for Quiet Storm music sets.It is nice that the cd buyer does not get burned with radio edits on this single. The first 3 mixes and track 6 are R&B;, Urban, Hip-Hopish and bedroom mixes that focus on being an alternate version to the original opposed to being club-oriented dance mixes. For the Club department, that is where 20 Fingers and Armand Van Helden come in. For a full vocal dance mix, 20 Fingers really delivers with a nice uptempo hook, rhythmic vocal samples and a solid house beat. Want dub, Armand does the honors with minimal vocal and music but thumpin' beats."
3,Very Stiff,"This book was written in a very dry manner...much like a history text book. Just words on a page, nothing came to life. I had no problem reading it before going to sleep. The movie was absolutely excellent and it's probably the first time I ever felt ""cheated"" by a book made into a movie; normally the book exceeds the movie overall. I finished reading it only because I finish what I start. Having said this, I, too, experienced a haunting and am, perhaps, a bit harder to scare than the reader who is interested in the paranormal but has never had first-hand experiences."
5,I Believe it Completely,"This novel depicts the true story of the Smurl family and their struggle to escape the spirits that torment them. They are assisted by Lorraine and Ed Warren, experienced demonologists, who try to save the family and uncover the mystery of why this is happening. Given the sheer number of witnesses I find it to be interesting that anyone can accuse them of making it all up. Besides that the experiences they describe match the type of attacks that real demons committ."
2,not very good,"I found this book also to be very dry and not nearly as interesting as others i have read, the best being, ""The Devil In Connecticut"" and ""The Demonologist"""
4,Makes personal finance easy to grasp.,"This book is very easy to read and is entertaining to boot. It's full of practical advise on how to invest, handle debt and even buy a car. I used their method of buying a car with great sucess."
1,Mining Fool's Gold,"For those who want to see the ""Foolish Four""debunked, see the study ""Mining Fool's Gold""in the 1999 Financial Analysts Journal.The Motley Fool's response to this articleis entertaining, as is all of their writing,but does not address the real substance ofthe article.For a worthwhile alternative, see JohnBogle's book ""Common Sense in Mutual Funds.""Being great and entertaining writersdoes not make these guys good investmentadvisors.I write this review as a form of social service."
2,all welsh people think they can sing,"and in this case, this group can really sing. their voices blend beautifullly and the music is so uplifting. I can see the hills and valleys of Wales, and feel a kinship to the land."
2,"Plenty of Military, not enough SF","This is my first read in this series. I generally enjoy military SF but this work reads basically like military drama but with planets and spaceships layered on top like an afterthought. Most of the story deals with the front-line characters, whereas I enjoy more of the backstage storyline.I understand that civil war plots are difficult to make work at all. I keep expecting the oft mentioned alien race to make a suprise appearance to unite everyone.Probably the last I'll read in this series."
2,HoHum,First of all I am a fan of this series. This entry is the weakest submission. I realize that in writing a multi book series there are going to be the odd stinker. It is difficult to always be at the same creative level. Who know this may have been a rush book because of pressure from an editor/publisher. I am sure that David Sherman and Dan Cragg will be back in fine form in the next book which I am looking forward to.
4,Great addition to the Series,"This is a much better book than ""A World of Hurt"". The action and politics were excellent. I am looking forward to the next book that is due this summer."
2,Incomplete,"This book is incomplete. The story just ends. Very disappointing.The work also seems to be put together in a disjointed manner, as if the authors were working to a deadline and didn't have time to edit their contributions to make them flow together.I've read other books in the Starfist group and did not expect this.I should have read the reviews more closely; I will in the future before purchasing works by these authors."
3,The end of creativity,"Like some of the other reviewers I've been disappointed that this story was broken up into two parts. Since I'm not dying to know what happens, I may not buy the second book. When I started reading this book, I recognized the storyline, even though its set in the 25th century. Its the American Civil War! I was hoping for a little more creativity in the story development but I guess all the stories have been told. I would have given this story 2 stars for its lack of creativity and ending in the middle, but the story was a well written knock off of American history so I gave it an extra star."
3,fun for beginners...,"Very well written. This book offers an introduction to ""crypto-stuff"" such as mono/polyalphabetic substitutions and grille methods. It doesn't go into much of anything else in huge detail, but it offers many methods including ""how to build"" your own encoding/decoding tools. If you're looking for some fun reading, I highly recommend it. If you're serious about learning though, check out ""the code breakers"" by kahn."
4,Great Prize for Security Training and Awareness Programs,We did an employee education piece on Cryptography and I used this book as a prize for staff members who successfully completed a cryptography quiz. Everyone LOVED it! It is a good basic book on ciphers.
4,"Interesting questions, intelligently answered.","Overall, the book was excellent. Marilyn vos Savant answers various questions submitted by the public, and the book reprints articles from her column. I enjoyed the various chapters, which included categories of brain-teasers and mundane trivia. I was disappointed in her answer of why kamikaze pilots wore helmets--I expect that they wore it for similar reasons that they wore the rest of their uniform. :-) I'm still puzzling over why a 200 pound person couldn't juggle three one pound melons on a raft with a 202 pound capacity, given that juggling a single melon requires exertion of an extra pound of force--after all, when all melons are in the air, there is no force on the raft except the weight of the person, so as long as the melons remain aloft long enough for the raft to float back to equilibrium, I don't see why any number of melons couldn't be juggled. Ah well... it's good to have answers that keep me thinking. :-)"
5,"Great brand, great product","The Ravensburger brand is something that I have been playing with since I was a kid. I had several puzzles from them and they were always very high quality. I bought 3 puzzles from them for my children, and they love them too. The quality has not faltered and they brought back great memories. The biggest problem is the price. These suckers are roughly 8 times the price of the crappy dollar store brands. Of course, I think they are worth 8x what the cheep puzzles are."
5,Love this fan,"This fan has fit my needs perfectly. I use it in my bedroom. It's small enough to sit nicely on my small dresser, but powerful enough to keep the air circulating. On hot nights, I like the option of stopping the oscillation so the air is aimed directly at me. At other times, I set it to oscillate and it moves the air all around the room. It is very quiet, but creates just enough white noise to keep me from waking up to other noises in and outside the house. My daughter borrowed it for one night and she was so hesitant to give it back that I decided to buy another one for her room. I haven't tried mounting it anywhere before, but it seems lightweight enough to me that it shouldn't be a problem."
4,Wall mount?,"I haven't pursued this very far but, mounting this on a wall looks to ba a bit of a chore. They shape also INFERRED (no it isn't stated) that maybe it had more adjustments than it does. The head pivots and that's it........ it is rather quiet."
5,"Extremely quiet, and moves lots of air, but somewhat counterintuitive to use at first","This is the quietest fan I have ever seen. Even those fancy bladeless fans make more noise. It also moves more air than the noisier fans on the market. If you're looking for something to use while sleeping, especially if you share a bed with someone who is super sensitive to any regular pattern of noise, this is your fan, hands-down.Now, if you want an oscillating fan, this is probably not for you. The front grill on this one can be set to rotate, and the fins on this grill will cause a slight oscillation as it rotates, but it isn't much.As a final note, operation is a little counter-intuitive; you must first turn the timer dial to the position marked ""on"" (which does not set a timer in this particular case), and then operating the on/off/speed dial will work as expected. I was at first worried that the unit was DOA."
2,It has potential,"I had to send mine back after a couple weeks. Wouldn't get up to speed, and would stop by itself. When it did run, it was very quiet. That's about all I can say. Didn't have it that long."
4,Value For Money,"pros: compact, powerful, good circulation , nifty rotation featurecons: The speed regulator knob comes off pretty easily, you would think they would have it fixed, rather than just use a slide in version.. also, you cannot swing the fan to point even slightly downward,overall, a good fan for the price you pay!"
3,Okay but not as advertised,"Fan just arrived in its original packaging (not shipped in another box). Due to the heat (I assume) in Texas, one side of the package was unglued. Fan still arrived in perfect condition. We specifically bought this to mount on the wall with the feet on the left side (as demonstrated in the operating instructions). Unfortunately, according to the manufacturer, the fan can only be mounted on the right side (with the controls on top). When attempting to mount on the left, the fan doesn't turn on. The manufacturer indicates the picture in the instructions is just to depict it can be mounted on the wall although the instructions specifically state ""turn the fan sideways - see image on the right"". The picture looks as if the controls are blue, but they are really black - not a big deal, just different. The fans seems durable. Haven't decided if we are going to return it."
5,So silent,"A friend suggested this fan for my office and I'm glad to have taken her advise. Not only is this fan virtually silent (on the lowest speed), the movement of the front panel keeps a direct air from constantly blowing on me. I love it and I'm thinking of getting another for home."
2,Does NOT oscillate,"So when you buy an oscillating fan you expect it to wave back and forth right??? Well not this fan. The ""oscillating"" option does nothing but cause the front grill to rotate. The fan stays stationary while its front grill spins and causes the air to change very slightly. Seriously, as an oscillating fan, this thing is a joke.... But as a stationary fan to just sit and blow in one direction this unit is alright. Overall I'm very disappointed as I was looking to buy a wall mountable oscillating fan."
2,The Oscillation misleading,"The oscillation mentioned is misleading. I thought the oscillation is horizontal ,means the whole fan component oscillates. But in real there is one revolving fan attached on front portion of the fan I don't' know the technical term for that.Also at one position the fan was not functioning.Also the oscillation is not covering the room.The high speed is not enough for a room.I suggest this fan is of just one person and it is very light so can be easily mounted on wall.I returned it and amazon promptly refunded money. Shipment came as promised from amazon."
4,"I ignored the obvious ""flaws"" but......","I am still pleased with this fan. It's efficient and effective and it's QUIET at all speeds! I like the rotating grill feature (they call it ""oscillation."") - it works really well.What I DON'T LIKE is that it tilts at a 45-degree angle, so once you have it tilted to aim it where you want the air to go, you have to to reposition the entire fan to get it to blow in the desired direction. This is a real PAIN. But as I said, I ignored this flaw when I purchased it. It would be almost perfect if the pivot points for the ""tilt"" were at 9:00 and 3:00."
4,Soleus Air Fan,This fan is great! I live in a humid climate and the timer on the fan lets it run just long enough to dry out the bathroom after a shower. It is quiet too.
4,Solved our problem,"We are using this fan to circulate heated air throughout our home. Our wood stove is in a back room of the house and we mounted it in the door way. It sure has made a big difference. The only drawback is that it can only be mounted one way. Other than that, we are very pleased."
4,It's Silent,If you're looking for a good silent fan this is the one. I originally bought one for our trip to Hawaii so we could listen to the ocean. We liked it so much we have bought another one!
5,Very quiet fan,"I wanted a fan that I could place in my bedroom window to blow in cool evening air without too much fan noise. This fan is super quiet. It has three speeds and when set on #1 (slow) it is quieter than any other fan I've owned. And on speed #1 it still blows a significant amount of air. I plan on buying two more of these fans!This fan also has a timer that will auto-shutoff so you can go to sleep with the fan on but not have to have the fan blowing all night long. The fan also has a ""tip over"" switch built in so it will shut off if it is not standing upright."
1,"Bough two, both broke within two weeks.","We purchases these fans for our kids rooms. My son's broke after two days, my daughters lasted I think ten days. My husband and I were the only ones touching them, so I can't blame it on the kids being rough. If it was only one I would understand, everything can't be perfect, but two that break that quickly make me think there is some shoddy workmanship."
3,You get what you pay for..,"It's all plastic - fan blades and everything else. The oscillator grinds so it's not quiet at all as long as you have the oscillator running. Thankfully you can turn the oscillator off, which makes it a whisper quiet fan that can't really keep the whole room circulating. For a 20 dollar fan, it's decent, definitely quieter than more expensive models as long as the dang oscillator isn't being used."
1,Just received a defective product,"The timer works, the oscillator works, but no air. The fan does not turn at all. I just submitted an RMA for a replacement."
4,Nice,We got this fan in October of 2010. It lasted until February 2012 with almost constant use. Not bad at all in my book.
3,Good for 'today's market',"This product is quiet and works well. Mine lasted about 2 years with near constant winter use. The front air spreading feature lated a bit over a year, the fan about two years. I will buy another to replace this because this what we have to deal with from the 'global' marketplace. Inferior by past standards, par for today."
5,Works very well and very quiet,I have this fan for about a year now.I am very happy with it because it is quiet and gives lots of air.It was left running in a hot room (40 degree C) for a day or more and it still works well.I am thinking of buying another one.
4,Works great - looks nice and is quite!,"I received a different color than the silver/blue as pictured. Mine surprisingly arrived in taupe/black that apprears to be metalic-looking which I actually preferred.Not much to comment about - The fan runs quietly, being relatively small-sized and the convenient timer shuts off the power in 30-min increments for up to two hours.For under $20 and free shipping, it was a great deal! Thanks, Amazon."
1,no bargain here,"thought I was getting a good deal, but you get what you pay for. Stops working when mounted and cannot stay on. Definitely do not recommend. Also, faulty guide book."
2,Not the item that's pictured,"It's NOT a 12 inch fan, it's a 10 inch fan--says so right on the box. And it not the cute little blue and white fan in the picture, either. It's gray.It's just a fan, so no big deal, I guess. But it will make me think twice about Target's online product descriptions."
2,Fan stopped working,"This was a great fan for the short time it worked. It is not too big and it pushes plenty of air. I used it for my desk at work, if you have a smallish work area you might want a smaller fan then this. I have had it for about 3 monthes and it has stopped working. This might be partly my fault because there have been times when I would leave work for the night and forget to turn the fan off. All and all I feel like this is not the fan for me because 3 monthes is just too short of a life span for a fan.Just wanted to update my review. This was operator error. It is working again."
4,So quiet!,"This is seriously the quietest fan I've ever had. It's practically inaudible on the lowest setting, and pleasant white noise on the highest setting. I do live in a somewhat noisy urban area, so take that with the appropriate amount of salt. I also really like that it has a timer. The only thing I take issue with is the ""oscillator"" feature. The front grill rotates, and I would hardly call that oscillating. It doesn't' seem like iit's really doing anything. Overall I'd recommend it if you're looking for a small, quiet fan.Oh, and the one I got was white, which is not at all a problem for me, but might be if you really want the silver/blue one in the picture."
4,Works Great,"I got this fan for use in my room at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan because the air did not circulate around my B-Hut. This fan sits at the door and has done a great job so far of pulling cooler air in the room and circulating it. I love the oscillation feature and so far, it has been everything I could want. I hope it makes it through the deployment so I can send it home and use it there too."
5,great buy,this is #4 the best fan i have found!!! tried and returned many others brands --very quite--and i love that they don't move
3,"""Oscillating"" not clear. (does not move from one side of room to the other)","Pros:-Is fairly quiet-Price-LookCons:-""Oscillate"" misled me. It does NOT move from one side of room to the other as expected. It looked like it would rotate on its bottom and top mounts but did not - to the makers, oscillate in this case means that the front guard spins to stir the direction of the air.-feels a bit cheap and light.We bought 7 of these for offices to keep air moving and dust down. They do serve the purpose despite the cons listed."
3,Color: White. Sigh.,"Ordered this from Amazon, not a 3rd party seller. The description says ""silver-and-blue"" in several places, and the picture is a dark silvery appearance. The fan I just received is stark white. I love the fan, but a white fan isn't going to work for me. Wish I didn't have to ""rate"" stars for my review--the fan is nice....timer, NEAT oscillator, quiet, etc. But I just want people to be aware that there is more than one color of fan out there, and you MAY receive something else."
5,Great Fan,"I love this fan. I use it at my desk at work. The oscillation feature is really cool, and it's a very quiet fan. My only complaint is that it seems like the ON/OFF dial is a little stiff."
1,I liked it but it didn't last long.,I loved this fan but after using it 6 months everyday for about 3 hours under humid conditions it just quit working. This was just in a whirlpool bathroom.
4,Super Small Fan,"Great little fan. Moves a lot of air for it's size. BUT!!! ...it will only wall-mount in one direction without the tip-over switch shutting itself off. We use it in a motorhome, and wall mounting would make this fan work much better for us. Well worth the money as a table fan anyway."
4,Introducing almost unknown pioneer aviator to the world,"Replica airplane feature from N Z at Expo 86. now center of attraction at the New Wellington airport,in New Zealand. Scientific American 1909 featured a spark plug incorporating compression controlled spark timing inside the actual plug body. The work of a true pioneer avaitor"
1,Introduction to C Programming: Just Barely!,"This book is improperly titled. It should be titled ""Modular Programming Using C."" The emphasis is on modular programming, not the C programming language. Only enough C is introduced to support the modular approach. All examples look like COBOL programs translated into C. I know of no C programmers who write code this way. This book is inadequate in its treatment of the preprocessor, standard input and output. Writing functions with arguments and return values is completely ignored. In my opinion this book never should have been written. If you want to learn C DON'T GET THIS BOOK!"
4,perfect for the beach,"I don't speak Portuguese but the music speaks for itself...funky, hip-hop, rap with some Brazilian flavor.I usually don't listen to this style of music but this cd is irresistible-in the car, at a party, the beach..."
2,Could have been better.,"I'm from Brazil and I've listened to all his albums. The other ones are a lot better, specially ""Ainda é só o comeo"". I really like this one because the lyrics are great and it's got very good beats. Check it out!"
3,Small for it's size.,"This box, while almost 21"" on the outside has no compartment that will hold an 18"" long item! The top compartment is permantly divided into a 12"" and 6"" space. The 6"" space is formed for up to 4 dividers, but no dividers that size were included. (I have a call in to Noble on that issue.) The drawers have an inside dimension of 15"". Only one drawer has a small compartment this big. All the others are divided along the 9-3/4"" dimension. I intend to use this for my custom fishing rod building equipment and supplies, but I will need to find a way to store my 18"" reamers. If I can get the larger dividers for the top, I can cut part of the 'permanent' divider out and make it work. It did come with 17 smaller dividers (in two sizes) to customize the spaces in the drawers. The ""Solid Brass"" for the latches actually consists of brass wire loops that hook over the plastic latches.I hope this info helps. Good luck."
1,Non delivery,"Nice box if you can get it . I ordered one but after several days, was notified that they were out of stock even though they are still advertising it and saying that they have 3 left. What's with that ??? Very disappointed !!!"
4,Early And One,"This album is 15 years old, and it lacks the polished songwriting of And One's more recent work (e.g. the fantastic Bodypop and Aggressor). However, it is unmistakably And One, and Steve Naghavi's voice sounds good as always. Highlights include ""Years"", ""Die Mitte"", and ""Techno Man."" Comparable (in my opinion) to the album ""Spot""."
3,too neat for my taste,"being a PJ Harvey hard die fan. This is my least favorite album of hers. The music is fine. but just not as courageus and breathtaking as her previous work. The album starts off and finishes without a moment where you would stop and really listen to the music. Nothing stands out of it. Is just pure and bland almost popish music where the lyrics are just predictable love anthems.It's not a bad album don't get me wrong. If you like well done pop music you will most likely enjoy it. It's just too easy listening for any previous PJ Harvey fan.When she was asked about this particular one she just said it is an album where she tried to make everything beautiful. And believe me that's what she got. pure and plain ''beautiful tunes''. But maybe just too beautiful. If you know what i mean. Try picking up Rid of me, to bring you my love or the innovative is this desire?. And you'll get a glimpse of why this simply isn't her. at least not her musical essence."
1,Back to the past,"Reading the reviews and listening to the album I get confused because itis, surprisingly, just a remake of her excellent album ""Dry"" of... 1993! It seems that, along with U2's latest, she is getting back to her roots. If that is all she could extract musically and creatively from living in New York in the last year, then I would conclude that is a lot of hype for nothing. Ifyou still want to listen to PJ,start with ""Dry"" and this latest is not at all compulsory."
1,I really didn't like ANY of this stuff,"This album was recommended to me as a work with powerful, deep lyrics and great music. I'm always game for something new, but this album reminded me of garage rock. Whittled down to almost nothing. Lackluster vocals and spare instrumentation. Nothing here for me. I can't believe someone compared these lyrics to those of Stevie Nicks. Not even close!"
4,a mixed bag,"pj harvey's 'stories album is largely made up of mellow, new york centric songs about the big apple, love and love in the big apple. there are four rockers, all in pairs. kamikaze and this is love manage to be engaging and honest while making good use of the gutsy guitar work. the two songs opening the album, however, are destroyed by stiff druming.some of this material is memorable, some of it isn't. what's nice is that when harvey hits her stride, this stuff is in a totaly superior class.the best song on the album is a duet with thom yorke that almost makes all those overrated radiohead albums ok, called this mess we're in.pj harvey provides a somewhat uneven, but deffinitely interesting album."
5,a supernova among mere stars,"As a New Yorker, I can assure you that PJ Harvey's latest CD is the perfect soundtrack to this city's endless noise, heat, and mystery. I think what I have always admired about her is how she manages to mine some of the most classic rock and blues influences and synthesize them in an innovative and emotional way. ""Good Fortune"" reminds me of a Patti Smith vocal matched to a Kurt Cobain chord structure but ends up being sheer Polly. Somehow her music transcends her influences, which perhaps has something to do with her lyrics. Her obsession with obsession seems to have ebbed a bit, but it has been replaced by a more reflective and deeper sentiment, and her lust has not (thankfully) lessened in the two years since her last cd. The rawness of 'This is Love,' the pain two people cause each other through love in 'This Mess We're In."" I could go on but join me and give thanks to this brave, honest, sexy and simply amazing artist."
5,In a rooftop in Brooklyn...,"In a wholly new light, Polly Jean Harvey shares her innermost feelings as a performing artist with this recording. Accused by some of going commercial -- Not True, IMHO, although she managed something I believed impossible: humming a PJ Harvey tune while driving and not being able to get it out of your head!- the most incendiary british female performer since Marianne Faithfull, explores a love affair and its aftermaths and possibilities.Songs like ""This is Love"", ""Good Fortune"", ""One thing"", and my favorite ""You said something"" manage to communicate a bouyancy a hope and a sense of love. This is the perfect gift for that person you want to understand how special he/she might be, and it is also, a manifestation of art, in more senses than one.God bless Ms. Harvey. May she com to new shores again and again."
3,Here She Comes Again,"Remember how great Patti Smith was before she decided she was a beat poet--back when she wrote actual songs, that were played on actual guitars, by actual rock and roll musicians?Well, throw in a better sense of melody and the ability to hold it all together over the course of a CD, and that's the closest approxiamation I can come up with for PJ Harvey.The woman who wrote ""Sheila Na Gig"" and then pummeled college radio with it--one of the few true rock records of the last 10 years--does so much on each song on this CD. ""One Line"" and ""Kamikazi"" are my personal faves, but the whole thing shakes, sometimes like a bad dream, sometimes like a roller coaster.PJ is what a lot of lesser acts--and even a few great ones, like U2 and latter-day Pretenders--try to be. She's brave and sexy and funny and smart and has more to do with rock than Blur or Oasis or Radiohead can even dream about."
3,Not her best,"This is a fine album - it's just not a fine PJ Harvey album. It's full of above-average songwriting, singing, and musicianship, and I quite enjoy playing it at high volume while cleaning house. However, it simply lacks the depth and poetry of PJ Harvey's previous work. In saying this, I'm not trying to consign her to the 'hag rock' ghetto, and bemoan the something that sounds like happiness on this record. Perhaps it is a challenge to bring depth to the simple pleasures of which she writes on this record."
5,frost,"This woman is entwined with much engima; I have little words, as it trangresses all..... She is understandably one of the most brillant musicians of today. I pity those who ignore."
4,Polly Comes Home!,"It's been much too long since we've heard Polly Jean Harvey's sex-ridden lyrics backed by a good beat and superb guitar riffs. And on Stories From The City... all of the aforementioned are a welcomed return to all of Harvey's fans. Not since 1995's To Bring You My Love has P.J. bared herself so intimately in such a clever and provocative manner. From the word ""go"" (or in this case ""Big Exit) Harvey let's the public know that she's back to her old self by chanting the anthem ""... I need a pistol, I need a gun....I'm scared baby, I wanna run...."". The first track sets the mood for the great tracks that are to follow. She keeps your attention through all 12 tracks. And just when you think it can't get any better, you heard an unmistakable voice that can only be (member of Radiohead) Thom Yorke. 2000 was a year full of landmarks and milestones in music, and now it will be remembered as the year that P.J. Harvey came home."
4,smokin'...... a great listen,"I don't write many reviews but thought I'd throw in my 5 cents worth about this wonderful album. Although it isn't the most original music PJ has made, it is one hell of a listen from beginning to end -- It's just too damn catchy not to tap your foot along to and hum with. While PJ's dabbling into electronica-tinged music from the previous two records was quite good, neither, I feel, is like a shot (of rock n' roll) in the arm when I need it. If you like a mix of acoustic, thoughtful tunes with barreling-ahead rock and roll full of emotion and intelligent lyrics, then grab this album NOW."
5,"I HEARD HER HOLLER, I HEARD HER MOAN...","There is something about this woman. Three days ago I got this CD. Two days ago I got her album ""To Bring you my Love."" And now I got her debut, ""Dry."" In these times of pop sensations and manipulative media, finding an artist as consumated as Ms. Harvey is something of a shock. The shock that there is music out there which, though low in profile, can compete with the best of them. Thanks for bringing us your love, PJ."
4,some well crafted stories,"pj harvey has consistently changed musical styles with every album, and her newest is no exception. STORIES brings pj's realism and gritty rock into a melodic and cosmopolitan scene. Standout tracks include: ""Big Exit"", ""The Whores Hustle and The Hustlers Whore"", ""This Mess Were In"" and ""This Is Love"". STORIES is an exceptional album from an exceptional artist, although not her best work to date. Newcomers to PJ Harvey should check out TO BRING YOU MY LOVE, arguably her most well crafted and artistic effort yet. Still STORIES offers PJ fans a rocking good time, with PJ's voice bursting with energy surrounded by sonics not seen on her last album IS THIS DESIRE. Altogether STORIES is more lighthearted and less dramatic than her past works and gives us a glimpse into PJ Harvey's more understated emotions of happiness and love.a very good album."
4,Love in New york City,"Late 2000 saw PJ Harvey release this great disc,a mixed bag of soft ballads and hard rockers.One of musics true unsung songwriters,Polly Jean lays out beautiful songs with understated playing and full throttle rockers that are as heavy as anything you`ll hear on the radio.New York City is the backdrop for most of the album,songs about falling and being in love mix with observations of the place she was at at the time...physically and emotionally.A great disc worth checking out."
3,"jeez, polly, you really are losing ground","Polly, what happened? Did Vincent Gallo make you do this?I loves you, Peej, so why'd you have to go & get all Liz Phair on me?You made a very boring album. Worse, it's not a PJ Harvey album. Where's the intensity? The passion? Did you lose in the subway station?Please don't make any more attempts at being hip. You're not; you're a raw nerve, a musical kick in the head, innovative & scary. A designer dress and a new haircut shouldn't change this.Happiness doesn't have to mean being bland & dull!I'll still buy your albums, Polly, but c'mon, leave the indie hipster act behind & get back to blowing our minds.Love,Linda"
1,A Disappointment,"PJ Harvey's DRY is one of those raw, brilliant, primal, literate masterpieces, like... nothing else on this earth. You must hear it. I cannot recommend it enough. It will change your life, if you play it loud enough, while driving. It is awe-inspiring.STORIES FROM THE CITY, in contrast, is about as musically appealing as lint on toast. It is the most rudimentary, 4/4, repetitive, dull, dull, and duller, dreary, mess of impossibly dull dreck. It lacks musical imagination. Poly-rhythms are gone in favor of an unchanging 4/4. The lack of variation is inexplicable. Melodies are 2-3 notes, boring as hell, and repeated ad nauseum. This is mad, mad horribleness, and it makes me shake my head. I've tried and tried to see what people like in this and I have failed. Bah."
3,The Mess We're In,"This album was my introduction to PJ Harvey and her voice is incredible, but I thought the lyrics were lacking. Being from New York myself, I felt the album hardly reflected influence of this city (merely mentioning a rooftop in Brooklyn, a bridge you see or a ""freeway"" (which we don't even call our roadways) doesn't say much). Lyrics are very important to me. The best track in my opinion is the duet with Thom Yorke from Radiohead ""The Mess We're In."" In fact, it has become one of my favorite tracks of any artist. The rest I can certainly live without. If I travelled to a city I wasn't from, I think I could come up with a much more descriptive narrative than this album."
2,I'm not really under 13. And I don't like this album!,"Okay, anyways, this CD is boring. I mean, where else can you get interesting rock music besides PJ Harvey? Hundreds of bands! Bands that push the limits and don't just rehash tired guitar parts and boring melodies. The only reason that it gets 2 stars is that the lyrics are decent. The only reason this CD may be useful is as a token girl CD. And there are plenty better girl groups to listen to - Sleater-Kinney, the Breeders, Sheryl Crow, X-Ray Spex, etc. This is boring music for boring people."
5,EXCELLENT ALBUM!!!,"This album is amazing, everyone has to hear it..I think that it is the best album I have right now..All the tracks in this album rocks!!! I think that PJ Harvey is sure a performer!SHE HAS A WONDERFUL VOICE AND SHE REALLY KNOWS HOW TO SING... You have to get this EXCELLENT ALBUM, cuz you will never regret it!!!!This album gets better and better every day I hear it!"
3,"I'm glad she's happy, but...","After listening to ""Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea"", I have a very hard time understanding why so many critics are lauding this album as her best to date. It's certainly her most upbeat and positive. While listening to it you almost can't help but bop your head to the beat. However, I expect better from PJ Harvey than head bopping pop. The lyrics are unispired and unoriginal, the melodies flat and no where near the complexity shown on past albums. Maybe an artist has to suffer to produce worthwhile art? For the first time in her life she may be happy, but I long for the old Polly Jean: passionate, angry, angst ridden, flushed, sexy, brilliant."
3,it leaves me dry,"I'm sure PJ is expanding and maturing and all that, and I readily admit that I know nothing of the technical side of music; I just know that PJ used to hit me right where I live and that she hasn't since Rid of Me. If you are waiting for the return of the raw, nasty power of Dry, Rid of Me, and the 4 Track Demos, you'll have to keep waiting. Or keep playing the old discs."
2,"Oh, Come On! Are you kidding?","I love PJ Harvey! I have a shrine to her next to all her albums. I've never been disspointed by PJ Harvey, but I can not endorse this album. For someone who made so many waves with her raw style and piercing lyrics before I have to wonder: Is she trying to sound like Patti Smith on purpose? I would never have accused her of being cliched before but the lyrics on this album are as mature as a 7th grader taking their first creative writing class. Yikes! Polly did you sell out?"
4,stunning...,"this is a stunning album, a perfect blend of grit and floating....PJ's duet with Thom Yorke is absolutely magical, i can't get enough..."
5,Of course it's different,"Reviewing P.J. Harvey's works by comparing them to earlier releases is next to impossible. She is always reinventing herself. This album is no exception. Though Is This Desire? is my favorite, Stories...is a close runner up. The tone is moody and consistant. Like always, the lyrics are introspective and pure poetry. While this album is a little more mainstream, and little more radio friendly, it is still completely original. The first single, Good Fortune might even make it onto top 40. Not that mainstream popularity is any measure of success, it would be nice for her to be heard by a larger audience. A must have for any PJ fan!"
3,PJ Harvey becomes a lacklustre hoo-hoo,"Why the hype over this sadly derivative album when she's put out so many truly great records? Rid of Me, now there's a rock record. This is tinny and lame, I'm sorry to report. I don't hear much of an emotional connection to the music. It feels forced. Ah well, who am I to talk? I'm up late in the middle of the night reviewing albums for Amazon, like I'm feeling as productive or as successful as dear PJ.Buy this album, if only to support someone who is doing her thing, and doing it well. But Four Tet has an amazing album out right now that's more valuable. I don't know anyone who hasn't loved it."
4,"CREATIVE ROCK MUSIC, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?","P.J. Harvey does a nice job at a variety of things. She rocks hardcore, but knows when to quiet down. I repect both her guitar work and her vocals. The songs are tight and well written, not to mention genuinly interesting, the rarest of all things in current radio. Her duet with Thom York from Radiohead, ""This Mess We're In,"" is a standout, as are ""Good Fortune,"" ""You Said Something,"" ""We Float,"" and ""Kamikaze."" If you saw her perform ""You Said Something"" on Letterman and liked it a lot, expect more of the same, but don't be surprised by something different. Polly Jean is a rocker at heart, but she isn't one note by any stretch of the imagination."
5,stories,excellent the energy of this album strikes me to the core.....in these days of blandless music a refreshing step back to rock and rolls roots a must listen!!!!
2,Awful,"This is by far her worst album. I'm not sure if it was intended as an f-u to her old fans or if she was really trying to sell out, but she seems to have forgotten what has made her unique. Here PJ is trying to make herself into a Lillith fair chick, having forgotten that there no longer is a Lillith fair. There are a couple decent songs here, but overall this is the only album of hers that I can say is a really bad one. ""We Float""? I mean come on. What happened to, ""douse her with gasoline""? Under no circumstances buy this album or accept it as a gift."
2,What Happened?,"I have liked everything that Pj has ever done. but this? this is schmaltz. Some people have said that it's her most accecible as if that's a good thing. accesibility on records generally means that the writer wasn't trying hard enough, that this music isn't anything you havn't heard before. very true with this album. this stuff is hardly original, hardly deep. Now, i won't blame Harvey for being happy, you can't hold that against her. But i will blame her for not trying. There is no depth here, especially in the production which is sqeaky clean and edgeless. This album bored me. Two stars because of the song horses. not a bad one. and the tom yorke songs come kinda close to being good. the last song is horrid, fluffy, cheesy you name it. SOrry Pj, i do feel bad giving this a bad review, but it wasn't that long ago that your albums were works of art...what happened?"
3,Strong synthesis,"3 1/2By her 5th studio release, one of indie rock's reigning queens had distilled her tortured pop into a casual science. Stories is another sturdy, if straightforward offering, with Harvey's rare ability to gently layer, and flesh out even the most uninspired chord changes on full display."
3,A true fan tells it like it is,"Mind you, I have all of her stuff. I just ordered the ONE thing I don't have (4 track demos). This is not my favorite album. It's good, probably better than most of the schlochhhhh out there in musicland. Is it a good listen? You bet. It's just not consistent. It definately has that new york/lower east side/village feel to it, all jangly guitars and (some) tough themes. Sounds like she listened to a lot of Television, Voidoids etc. era music.The ones I love: Good Fortune (not every day either, sometimes this is a skipped track), but the always always listen: Whore's Hustle and Hustlers Whore, You Said Something (the whole ""on a roof top in Brooklyn.."" I lived this song!), This is Love, We Float. The other songs I could take 'em or leave 'em. In fact, the You Said Something song is a brilliantine star in my book. It's worth buying the CD for.Get the twofer of this one and To Bring You My Love Amazon offers and you have the excellent and the almost excellent."
3,pretty mundane despite a couple great songs,"while there are definitely a couple outstanding songs on this cd, this cd as a whole is not particularly interesting. i cant believe that there was a time when PJ Harvey was my favorite musician and now i have just listened to her new cd and feel completely apathetic. yeah yeah she has developed her sound. modern day patti smith?...maybe. not really. she used to have a cutting edge, sound but while i can understand how fans might think this is a great cd it really is not relevant to current music. what i am getting at is that it sounds almost annoyingly grungy at times. even this desire? was more interesting than this, at least she was experimenting with new sounds. having a ""mature"" sound isnt always a good thing. the glossy pictures in the cd booklet, however, are very pretty. they look like they're straight out of jane magazine. too bad it doesn't make up for a boring cd."
4,She Floats,"PJ Harvey's songs can occasionally tend to be on the bland and repetitive side, but this album stands up very well to repeated listening, revealing a low-key acerbic insight beneath the standard rock presentation. And it sounds like the duet with Thom Yorke has done her musical ambitions the power of good, as Ms Harvey now confidently breaks away from her traditionally punctuated vocal style and allows her voice to soar in a spirit of melodic abandon (showcased beautifully on the sublime ""We Float""). Mick Harvey's production job may have had a lot to do with these changes, but it definitely sounds like PJ is discovering a whole new side to her musical persona."
4,The album you've been waiting for....,"Finally, something wonderful is released on this cop ridden planet. PJ Harvey is back and loud again. Even though I suspect it's not going to be as good as Is this Desire? I can already tell I love it. Not a bad song on it. Buy it and start waiting for that new Tool record."
2,Disappointing,"Warning to anyone who hasn't heard PJ Harvey before: don't start with this album. You won't continue on to her others, and that would be a shame! This album lacks all of her originality, ferociousness, and passion - it has heart, but it's of the Sarah McLaughlin-type heart - a wee placid and boring. Anyone could have made this album and written these songs. It has its moments (the duet w/ Thom Yorke, and ""We Float""), but it doesnt have enough of these moments. Buy ""To Bring You My Love"" instead, and see what she is really capable of."
4,Polly's first grown-up album?,"This may be remembered as Polly Harvey's coming-of-age album. I love everything she's done and have admired her cajones since I first heard ""50 Ft Queenie"" way back when, but this new album is a real turning point. After dabbling in garage rock (""Dry""), grunge rock (""Rid of Me""), electronica (""Is This Desire?""), and everthing else (""To Bring You My Love""), she's ditched the studio musicians and uber-producers (i.e. Flood and Steve Albini), and made a wonderfully understated rock-and-roll album that's all her. Get it (along with all her other ones)!"
5,what a great read!,"I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I picked up this book. But once I started I just couldn't stop. The characters and situations made me laugh and cry, sometimes at the same time. Read this book, it's a wonderful insight into a time gone by about a man larger than life."
4,"More than ""Magic""","Catchy, Catchy, Catchy tunes. Sure the lyrics are simple...sometimes downright silly(see ""Auntie Iris"") BUT you'll never find a 70s band with songs with more hooks. Also, David Patons vocals are so unique and very captivating.Not only do you get all of the fingersnappin' gems from Pilots first album, this special release includes 3 songs from ""Second Flight"" and 2 from ""Morin Heights"" their only other US releases. Both recommended if you can find them!Obviously the group was tremendously influenced by the Beatles but there is certainly nothing wrong with that! Especially when you pull it off the way these guys did!"
5,The most beautiful pop/rock recordings in the history.,"At least one of the most beautiful pop/rock recordings. Finally I got this CD and am enjoying right now. Still I got a chill! Best $15 I spent on Ebay. Oh, I found the bonus tracks (total 5) are really cool too. If you encounter this CD somewhere, please check the back of jacket (or back of CD). Three happy guys are running, smiling. This is what exacly you will get from this wonderful musicians and their music.Believe me and order a copy right now!!!!If you'd like a description,The beatles+Alan Parsons+Creativity+Prettiness+Good taste=Pilot."
4,A good idea,"It's safe to say Pilot was a two-hit band (Magic & January), with ""Magic"" being the more prominent hit of those two hits... and here those two songs are sold together! Simple, yet effective."
4,yeah,"if you like Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, check this out, you won't be disappointed. What a lovely language: Noswyliwn ni yn dy wely plu..."
2,Overly technical,"First of all let me tell you that this book has too many words and it has overly explanations that'll make a dull read. In the other hand it has too many technical explanations that if you're a pilot or something like that you'll understand the technicalities. But if you are a layman in the airspace subject like me, this book is a waste of time.If you want to read an airplane story without technicalities read Airframe by Michael Crichton this is an enjoyable one.One more thing, how is possible that a Navy Admiral takes orders from his minion?"
2,A Bad Trip,"This is a highly contrived story of an incident involving a supersonic passenger airliner. While the technical details are reasonably accurate, the motivations and actions of most of the main characters are not realistic or believable. Not up to other deMille works. He can't be proud of this book, but maybe he needs the revenue."
2,Mayday by DeMille & Block,"DeMille is one of my very favorite authors and when I saw that he had a new book out that I was unaware of, I ordered it. In my haste to get this ""new"" book, I failed to note that it was co-written and was initially published years ago. It is not up to the usual high quality of a DeMille read. It lacks the crisp flow of the story-line that he normally provides, is predictable (which is usually absent in his tales) and over all is less DeMille than Thomas Block."
4,TENSE & EXCITING! MORE OF A 4 1/2 STARRER!,"When I came across the book in a garage sale, I just bought it coz DeMille's name was familiar. I'm glad I did! Of course, the ending was predictable..had to be a happy ender. But what keeps you at the edge of your seat is how the survivors managed throughout the flight & how they DID it!"
3,not demille's best...,"but maybe because it was his first?..or one of first? . . . heard taped version of this airport thriller . . . some suspense, but i have liked other books by demille better."
5,DeMille's first novel is as good as his last!,"The BEST prose of any writer in the suspense thriller genre alive today. If you haven't read BY THE RIVER BABYLON yet, do so because you are in for a treat. DeMille gets your heart rate up, lets it down slowly, gets it up again, lets it down again, and repeats all through the novel! WHAT A GREAT READ! Advice to frequent flyers: Don't read it!"
1,BORING and Not Believable,"As a DeMille fan, I was truly disappointed with Mayday. It was simply not a believable premise, was tedious and a slow read. As for Block . . . hope he doesn't loose his flying job . . . or that he can come up with a far better storyline for his next book (if he's planning one)!"
2,"Been there, done that","If you're a Nelson DeMille fan and want the quirky humor of his other leading characters, this is not the book for you. I always look forward to a new DeMille book and read them with enjoyment. I felt obligated to finish this one."
1,The First and the Worst of the Nelson Demille books,"If you've read The Gold Coast, Up Country, The Charm School and Word of Honor, you would never guess that Mayday was co-written by DeMille. The characters are flat, their dialog is hollow, and they're devoid of personality. The author tells you how to think and feel rather than the reader making those decisions for themselves. A page turner, but only to get to the end of the book. In fairness, the book started out presenting an interesting scenario of the chaos found when a supersonic plane is hit by a missile but it was all downhill from there."
3,"Good book, although not DeMille's best....","I read Mayday yesterday - in one sitting! It is extremely fast-paced and the events in the novel lend itself towards very fast reading, although at times it gets a bit technical. You're guaranteed to be captivated from the beginning and taken along for a wild ride, which in a post-9/11 world becomes even scarier as terror in the skies strikes a nerve with many Americans, myself included.Although some parts were pretty predictable, I believe many readers will enjoy this novel, especially those with any interest in aviation, the military, conspiracies, action/adventure, etc. While this is not my favorite DeMille book by far, I think its a good solid book, well researched and full of what I am assuming is accurate technical information, courtest of Thomas Block's expertise. This would make a great movie too!"
5,PAGE TURNER,"COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN UNTIL THE AIRPLANE WAS DOWN! GREAT CHARACTERS; EXHAUSTING BOTH PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. DEMILLE NEVER DISAPPOINTS."
4,mayday,I really enjoyed the updated verson of this older book. Nelson deMille is one of my favorite authors they did a great job bringing this old story into todays world.
2,Disappointing,"I generally enjoy DeMille's books a lot, especially Gold Coast, Gatehouse and the Plum Island. Of course John Cory is great as I love his humor. However, Mayday just went on and on and on with details getting extremely boring after awhile. A lot of the book just didn't sound like DeMille."
3,"Easy read, entertaining","This is the first novel I've read in a while. It was diversionary, a deliberate tactic to take my mind off the real life heavier topics I normally read. It entertained me, and I was satisfied by it. Great literature? No, but then WHO WRITES great literature any more (a small handful of exquisite writers, that's about it). If you're looking for an easy read that's entertaining, holds your attention in a way that doesn't make great demands on your intellect, then this book is for you."
2,No Tom Clancey,"When I read the back cover at the book store, I thought I was buying a good thriller. However, I was soon dissapointed. After reading through half the book, I saw it as I see many bad adventure movies that rely on gore to cover up a bad plot. This could have been a great story but did it need an passenger compliment of brain damaged people to make this story good. Or the fact that almost everyone on the ground is an evil monster. I thought I was going to be reading a good book about desperate people trying to save the passengers with help from the ground. Also, the suspense is lame, I was waiting to find out at the end that he only had 3 minutes to make it to his dinner appointment, and oh my, oh my, oh my, the traffic is heavy, oh my, he isn't going to make it, what is he going to do!! Read the true story of FedEx Flight 705 for a true thriller instead."
3,A Familar Story,"Many books and movies have been done on this topic with differing moifications. The novel was initially written in 1979 and was updated by the writers in 1998. It is about a severely damaged Jumbo Jet where the pilots are no longer available to fly the plane. This opens the door for one of the passengers to come front and center and attempt to save the day. This book differs from others that do have similar stories with areas of intrigue existing as well as many double and triple twists existing in the story. Although it appears that this is a story that you have read or seen before, it is so well written that one goes through this work very rapidly. The characters are very well deveoped by the writers in the good, although somewhat harmless, read."
1,How do spell rubbish - M A Y D A Y !!,"Very poor, after the first few pages I thought, I've read this before, so I checked my shelves and there it was ""MAYDAY"" by ""Thomas H Block"" a book I bought about 10 years ago, and guess what, it's about a supersonic airliner hit by a missile, decompressed with only 5 people alive...blah blah blah. It was bad then, and a few tweaks and sticking Nelson DeMille's name on it don't make it any better.AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS !!"
5,Suspense and thrills at their best,"Mayday was a surprise for me! I could not believe how suspensful this novel was. I have had a hard time finding novels that WOW me anymore, that don't follow a formulaic and predictable plot. This book remewed my faith in fiction! This book made me feel like I was watching a movie. I often had that feeling of anxiety in the pit of my stomach! I felt all the emotions the authors wanted you to feel- I also felt that the plot twisted and turned like a roller coaster ride! These poor people surviving on this plane had so much against them. The main thought that sticks with me is that I hope I will never have to hear the gutteral groans described as coming from the brain-dead passengers. Simply chilling! A must read for suspense and thriller enthusiasts!"
4,"Fast-paced, surprising and suspenseful",Fast-action thriller. Anything that can go wrong does. So many obstacles to overcome. I must say that there was one scene that was moving. It was the saddest moment in all of the books I have read. Good job of keeping us on our toes.
2,Mayday,the book started out very exciting and about half way through it became unbelievable. I did finish the book to see how stupid the end would be. I have read alot of Nelson DeMille books and he should write his books by himself.
4,Mayday,"Very thrilling read, like most by this author. Also enjoyed ""Death Benefits"" a short story by DeMille. Would recomend this to anyone looking for an intense read."
4,Good read,"This book makes me glad I never took the Concord. I throughly enjoyed reading this book. Interesting plot turns but a bit heavy on the corporate greed and military industrial complex angles. I'm more of a flag waver, greed is good guy but those aspects did not take away from my enjoyment."
1,Too ponderous to finish,"I have really enjoyed some of DeMille's books (Gold Coast and The General's Daughter especially), but this one is awful. Maybe the problem is that it was co-written; it's pretty hard to come up with a good result with this process. Whatever the cause, the writing is clumsy and self-conscious. The initial descriptions (the 'set-up') go into too much dry technical detail; it often feels like the start of a science-fiction story where the author feels compelled to explain all the high-tech magic so we earthlings will be able to understand what's going on. Characterization is minimal--it's all about the situation. I don't know how the book ends, and I don't care...I just couldn't force myself to slog through it to find out."
2,Mayday!,I read the Thomas H. Block version and it wasn't all that good. I haven't read the updated version (please tell me if there is much of a difference other than technological) I read it on the plane for a laugh (the cover has a plane crashing on it) but the last laugh was on me.
4,Great Read,Nelso DeMille has an excellent writing style. His humor is outstanding. I have read 90% of his books and I am never disappointed.
2,Disappointed,Demille is my favorite author but couldnt get into this book at all- was completely implausible story line for me
4,A Good Read,"A departure from most of Nelson DeMille's other novels, but very suspenseful to read. Thomas Block brings great flying details and inner airline workings to the party!"
4,great for the aviation nut,"Extremely interesting book, different kind of plot. Not what you can expect from the usual airplane movie or book. You are being guided throughout the story through different characters and places, so it really does provide you with a wide perspective of the situation, almost like if you were at a movie theater, with the added bonus of your own imagination.Nelson DeMille just nails it again!"
3,"Good, fast-paced, suspensful pulp fiction","Among its other attributes, the book showcases the authors' strong knowledge of aeronautics & piloting airplanes. It also highlights the deplorable cynicism and dishonesty that can be found in airline & insurance company management just as it's found in the highest echelons of politics & financial services."
3,"Early, underwritten work by great action author","Nelson DeMille is one of my three or four favorite authors. He passed Tom Clancy and John Grisham some time ago.DeMille writes with an almost frantic pace, using regular guy heroes who emerge from the ruins of tragedy or terror. ""Mayday"", about a jet airliner accidentally damaged by a missle over the Pacific, offered DeMille an early chance to develop his style. Placing almost al of the action in the fuselage of the damaged plane limits his stage. The details of decompression at high altitude are not pretty. The male and female leads are heroic. The victimized pilot of the fighter that fired the deadly shot is a good, if side story.The conclusions are somewhat predictable. I finished with small disappointment, having read much of his later work earlier."
5,A Great Book to read...safely on the ground,"This was the first book I read by Demille. It is great! The story is so captivating. Demille has written a great book. I am in the 8th grade, I read it in the 6th grade I never found a book about air disasters as good. No matter the price it is worth the money. But read it on the safety of the ground."
4,One of His Best Books,I have read most of DeMille's books but I believe this is the best. Fast paced with original story lines this is one book you truly will not want to put down.
4,Mayday,This was a very interesting read. It keep your attention and is very hard to put down. I really enjoyed reading it from start to finish.
4,Great story.,Exciting read. Glad he republished it. Another reason DeMille is one of my favorite authors. You will enjoy this one.
5,Nelson DeMille never fails to tell a good story,"His writing is excellent, his characters realistic and his sense of humor refreshing. He has provided many fascinating facts about all kinds of places of interest."
5,Great read,Could not put this book down. A thrilling ride. You will never get on a plane again with the same attitude. I loved this book.
1,beware,"After a few months this unit started to get picky about recognizing dvdr/dvdrw discs. It got progressively worse, but since I don't play that many dvdrs, I did nothing. When it locked up on the Talking Heads dual discs I sent it back for repair. I received a refurbished unit with 'b-stock' stickers on the box and on the back of the unit. It is playing dvdrs better, but still no luck with the Talking Heads. Surveying the net there seems to be some major build quality issues with this unit, in addition to it's faulty firmware. Since there is no updated firmware, it is likely that some future DVD-A and/or dual disc releases will also fail to play on this unit."
1,Avoid at all costs,"I was drawn to this unit because it plays everything (including both DVD-audio and SACD formats) and is a five disc changer. Unfortunately, the unit is very slow to respond to commands, especially loading the discs and opening the tray. Moreover, the tray doesn't rotate or come out all the way, so it is very difficult to access the back two discs. More importantly, two units have failed on me (stopped responding to commands altogether) after a couple of weeks. I have had to send both units back to the distributor full of CDs/DVDs. This is a piece of junk!"
1,Do not buy,I have had the same problem - several DVDs freezing and you have to disconnect from mains to recover and restart.Not recommended
4,Great Overall!,"I have had this for over a year now, and have not had any major problems. Yes, I agree it can be a little slow to respond at times. But for a lower priced changer that plays so many formats, it is great. I never, during the last year, had any dvds freeze up on me until this past week when I too purchased one of the Talking Heads Dualdiscs. But, after reading online about others having this problem, I cannot blame it on the player. It is the Dualdiscs themselves, they are having problems with; and the manufacturers have said as much themselves. I burned a copy of the dvd side of it, and it plays fine. So, while this player may not be absolutely perfect, it cannot be blamed for things that are not its fault."
5,Interesting Rehearsal Sessions for Gram Parson's GP album,"If you're looking for studio recordings of these songs, buy the great GP album. If you want insight into how GP was created, how Gram Parsons taught EmmyLou Harris to sing harmony, and want to hear the other songs they were kicking around at the same time, you might want to check out ""The Lost Recordings."" As noted on the back insert, these are rehearsals. I personally enjoy hearing rehearsals and demos and getting to witness part of the creative process that goes into making a great album like GP. I don't expect the recordings to be studio quality, or vocals and instruments balanced. I know it's a practice with a tape running and take that as an addendum to the final product."
4,Extraordinary.,"Bold features a mix of Shetland traditional tunes, original pieces by MacDonald and a few other unfamiliar tunes. She has a colorful, passionate mastery of the music, from the fast-paced ""Shetland Fiddle Diva/Purfy"" and the melancholy ""Michael's Mazurka"" to the intense ""Eilidh's Trip to Germany/The Monday Morning Reel/Land ta Lea"" and the hard-to-describe ""The Lost Ponytail/Dennis' Tune."" Perhaps the most unusual moment comes in track 10 -- ""Da Silver Bow/The Joy of It! -- which melds MacDonald's sweeping fiddle with Iver Kleive's church organ. It's an odd combination, to say the least, which is perhaps why I've spent so much time playing and replaying it. The set climaxes in a lofty inspirational finish, placing a nice cap on the album."
5,A fun yet meaningful read,"I really liked Angela's style and link to living the spirit-filled life with dancing. I thought her chapters on the Holy Spirit were very good and practical as well. I enjoyed the read because I've been doing a lot of in-depth study and working out of my faith and it was very fun and at the same time based on Truth and solid biblical principal's. I would recommend it to all women on their faith journey....if you're really ""theological"" it will be a welcomed breath of fresh air, if you're a new christian you'll enjoy the down to earth advice."
5,Rev. Fuzzy Lake,This book is a must for women who don't know who they are or where they are at with the love that God freely gives.Recomend it to all women struggling with being loved.
3,Hmmmmm.......,"I had high hopes for this book and it left me flat. The book should really be promoted as a great book for a woman in the midst of a mid-life crisis, not a ""learn to be righteously confident"" type-attitude.Angela is a great writer and I think there will be a lot of woman out there who will benefit from this book. I just feel the packaging may be a tad misleading. This is a book for women over 30 in the midst of personal struggle. Not an encouraging book for women of all ages on confidence....which is how I perceived the book.All in all, I found Stasi Elderedge's ""Captivating"" to be far more insightful."
3,Plot was sound,"A decent story with a sound plot, though the writing wasn't my style, as it doesn't seem to flow very well. It also had a very solid ending. The details seem to align quite well with other episodes, no major blunders or anything. 3 of 5 stars."
5,FANTASTIC!,"wow, from start to finish this is just about as good a star trek as you can get...you can tell that the author loves and KNOWS the characters well...kirk's disposition, the interplay between mccoy and spock, uhura, scotty...it's all there...everything a star trek fan loves about the series is most definetly in this bookI counted reference to about 5 different star trek books...one of which is the classic, City On the Edge of Forever...that's part of what makes this a great book..it uses what happened in those episodes and expands on them WITHOUT irreparably changing what happened..it is a time travel story, to an extent and that can get pretty dicey..but everything gets tied up in a neat little package..this book is up there with Entropy Effect, Covenent Of the Crown, Black Fire and Web of the Romulans as my favorite trek books that I've read so far."
5,"Good look into Spock,and an exciting story besides","I really liked this book,as well as its sequel,""Time for Yesterday"".It centers on Spock and his newfound son,Zar;and on how their relationship developed.The beginning of the book,where Spock brings the telepath,Marishal,to The Guardian of Forever,and the following events all make an exciting,well-flowing story.A good read,enjoy!"
1,like father like son,"I have been a Trekkie since the show came out in the 60's and this is one of the best Star Trek stories that I have read or seen. The new charaters in this book are very believable and the way that Spock and his son are written is achingly true of many father and son relationships. Granted they have a few more problems than most..... There is also plenty of the usual give and take between the captain, doctor, and Spock. I like good endings and this has one. What more can you ask? This is a good read."
4,A Favorite,"Ann Crispin is another one of my fave ST writers and this is one of my favorite books, though I do have to say that the sequel is even better. I like how Spock has to figure out how to be a father let alone how to deal with a grown son. Not all of it works, but enough of it works to make this a good book...read this then go read the sequel Time for Yesterday, it's even better"
3,Excellent Star Trek entertainment,"I enjoyed this one a lot. Although I prefer ""hard"" science fiction, as applied to the Star Trek universe, over fantasy, this story nevertheless is internally consistent and very entertaining. The character Zar, Spock's son, is unforgettable. Throw in the Romulans, who are always good for clean fun, and you have a very decent novel that holds the reader's interest.The characterizations of the main characters are this novel's greatest strengths. Zar is vibrantly portrayed, and the author also does an excellent job with the personality clashes between Zar and Spock. All of this makes for an engaging and (like most Star Trek novels) quick read for a sunny afternoon."
4,An excellent book for the forever young,"I should have guessed from the cover picture that The Universe.. was a book for adolescents. I started reading a couple of chapters then gave up. Then one rainy day, I decided to pick the slimmest volume on the shelf and promised myself to read the book to the end. The Universe got picked, and guess what? I not only managed to finish it but I enjoyed it. I guess we all have a child somewhere inside us waiting for an opportunity to get out and enjoy his/herself."
4,Very good books - too bad they are out of print!,"Telzey Amberdon is a character I loved. She is telepathic and often in trouble just because of that fact. Schmitz 's books are a ""must read"" for any serious science fiction - fantasy reader."
3,Was great at first...,"But then I guess I filled it too much and tried shoving it under my bed, it fit, but then trying to get it back out, sadly I ripped the plastic top. They are convenient, but don't over pack it. Pack only what you use RARELY. I put some stuff I only need in the winter and vice-versa. 2 things sold me on this item, the clear top, for seeing in without opening, and the canvas, to squish under bed and fold when not in use. If you don't overpack then you won't break it."
3,O.K. But Cheap Material,I do not need to write an extensive review. Others have already done that. The material is really thin and cheap. Do not expect too much from this. I will say that compared to some of the other alternatives this may still be the better way to go.
5,This book is a very funny book!,This book is a very good book. It is a book about a pig who doesn't want to go to the market.His name is Ace and when the farmer finds out that he talks he spares his life. Soon the T.V. station finds out about that. Find out more about that when you read the book.
4,This is a cool funny book!!,"This book is so cool, i recommend this book for readers who enjoy farm life and animals who lives on the farm, If I would rate this book on a 5-point scale, I would say it would be a 4..because the pictures could have been colourful instead of black and white, but overall I liked this book. Bye!"
3,Not as I thought,"This fan is very cool, have a lot of movements possibilities. However, if you are locking for a fan to put in your bedroom while you are sleeping this is not the fan for you. It is very noisy because the slow speed is actually very fast.Cheers,"
3,fourth time not a winner,"Have purchased 3 other Soleus Air FSH fans with remote control and, based on their excellent performance, I purchased a 4th. The fan works very well, but the remote control on the fourth is spotty at best...or you have to practically be on top of it for the signal to get through ....which is a hassle. After going through the trouble of putting it together, it was too much trouble to attempt to return it, so we've kept it since it actually functions rather well in all other respects."
4,Very Good Fan,"This fan is very good, the reason I am giving it a 4 star is because it takes so long to put together and it is not very easy. I will say that it is a very well built fan and has great features.Soleus Air FSH-40G 16-Inch Back Lit Stand Fan, with Remote Control"
1,Worthless without Screws!,"This product came without the 4 essential 'speciality' screws to put it together. I called Soleus' Customer Service & a guy there stated he'd send the screws out the following day. A week went by and nothing. Called again, left messages (suddenly the rep was either 'busy' or out of the office; or else no one answered the phone at all!) and sent emails: received no responses to three phone messages and two emails. Whoever J.Wagner is, he must have stock in the company and I'm sorry I based my purchase on his 'glowing' review. The box clearly states: MADE IN CHINA. The photo here on Amazon & on the box makes the fan appear of higher quality than it is. The fan unit is plastic and cheesy looking! It's certainly not a quality fan. I am returning it to Amazon and have learned a lesson about dealing with 'unknown' companies. But Amazon stands by its customers, thankfully, or else I'd be OUT OF LUCK!"
1,Out of synch audio,"I am a huge Dallas fan and love my dvds even though on the 1-3 seasons the audio is out of synch with the video. I mainly watch these when I am ironing so it does not bother me too much, but it would be nice if this issue was resolved."
2,Dallas The Complete Third Season,"I love watching the series again after all these years. But, since I have bought season 3 I seem to have a problem keeping it running. It keeps kicking me out. I have to shut down my Kindle and restart it a couple of times. Once it is running for a while it seems to go okay. It tells me I have no internet connection, so I go to my settings and it shows I have connection, but I put in my password and connect again...that seems to work, but don't feel like I should have to take ten minutes to get the show up and running."
5,One of the best season ever,Dallas third season is the best because you see how Jr really treated his wife. And plus he gets shot at the season final when you know shot him that was the best left you hanging even if you know who did it. And the truth about Jr. baby and his wife and her affir with Cliff.
4,One of my all time favorites but......,"Been looking forward to the release of this DVD set. One of my all time favorite TV shows. Why am I giving this only 4 stars? I was extremely disappointed to read that only Patrick Duffy & Linda Gray did commentary on 2 episodes. Where were all the other actors at? Would have BEEN much better to see Larry Hagman, Charlene Tilton, Steve Kanaly & Ken Kercheval appear & speak about episodes."
5,Best season of the entire show,"Season 3 was, IMO, the best of the entire series. Almost every episode was a classic. Everything worked: the writing, the acting, and the charisma of the stars. First rate TV entertainment. Note: notice how slim Larry Hagman is in the last few episodes."
2,Dallas The complete third season,I purchased this DVD. I started watching the 3rd and 4th DVD these DVD were all scratchedthey kept freezing. I had to purchase a scratch repair kit and fix these DVD's I was goingto purchase more Dallas complete Seasons. I do not think I will be purchasing through AmazonI feel these were used DVD'SThank YouKasieann Stough
4,missing the last two episode,"i'm glad dallas to watch dallas again but the last two episode are missing ""wheeler dealer"" and a house divided.hopefully you guys add them and i dont have to pay 3 bucks for them .i brought season 3 of dallas without knowing about the last two episode missing"
3,It's a reprint,"Nobody's mentioned that this book was first published in 1870, under the title 'A Stem Dictionary of the English Language'."
2,Word Stems: A dictionary,"I'm sure this book was useful in its time, 110 years ago. However, I have not yet found it of any value in my researches into etymology, philology, Indo-European roots, or the social history of English words. Perhaps I misunderstood its purpose when I chose to buy it."
3,"well, its technical all right","As the songs progressed on this album, i began to wonder... is it possible to compose that kind of music, or are they just randomly playing? Ya, its that weird. If you compare this album to the previous one, extension of the wish, you may either love the change or hate it. I, for one, did not like it.The music is technical/prog with riffs and weird time sigs all throughout. The new vocalist is so boring it almost kills the music. It is seriously almost nothing like the previous album, but it is heavy and unique. cant wait to see what they come up with next... sigh"
5,A must have for progressive rock fans!,"I have noticed this album has gotten quite a few poor reviews and quite frankly I'm dumbfounded! However, I will say that I heard II=I and have still not listened to Extension of the wish simply because I love Fremberg's voice. It may throw you off at first, but he's got a superb voice. In fact, I frequently am unimpressed with vocalists in progressive metal bands. The title song Two is one really displays their diversity and dynamics. I grew to like this album more and more as I listened to it. It's certainly not for the faint of heart and contains dazzling displays of instrumentality. Expect not any 4/4 time signatures...well maybe a little. All in all, I think this is a wonderful album. Lejon displays tremendous chops and dynamics, with ghost notes and some double bass...but not too much. I give it 5 big ones!"
3,Good music...weak singer,First of the music seems well thought out and a great production is here as well.But where it fails is in the weak vocal delivery...he sounds to much like a beer commercial during superbowl half time specials.Not that he cant sing just doesnt sound good with this style of prog-metal.And that said the music is good not outstanding...seems like they try to hard at times to pull off certain polyrythms etc.But not a bad sophmore effort here..althought im a bigger fan of Extension.No dream theater here:(
3,Awesome.... but,"This book is awesome, I'm excited to take a road trip with some friends and try to explore as much of these landmarks as I can. The author was able to keep his personal preferences aside to cater to everyone with different points of interest, and he does a good job. But I think it would have been even more better if he put a little bit more history about the places and the people. But I enjoyed it nonettheless and will be getting the rest of them."
3,Interesting to flip through at the library,"This book has enough real ""material"" for about a third of its length, and then the rest in my opinion is ""filler"" - info regarding obscure happenings that no one is likely to be much interested in. I also felt that the entries were way too short (a mere paragraph for each). It would be nice to have a bit more background material on what happened there, what led up to it, etc.There are good entries (such as the ""garage"" where Apple computers was born, the street where Marilyn Monroe did her ""skirt blowing"" scene, the location of the original Woodstock, or Buddy Holly's crash site and last gig), but I just wish there was more of the good and less of the ho-hum.Definitely worth checking out from the library. (For another interesting book in this vein, I highly recommend ""THE TOMBSTONE TOURIST"" by Scott Stanton.)"
5,Fascinating!,"This book reminds me of the Book of Lists that were popular in the 70s. I could always pick those books up and find some tidbit I had missed in previous readings.This book highlights events you know happened, but may not know where they happened. I particulary liked items such as the fact that there is now a Virgin Megastore where the old Schwab's drug store was in Los Angeles. (Where, in fact, the author tells us that Lana Turner was NOT discovered!)A great summertime read. (Or any other time of year, for that matter!)"
5,Darling video,"This is a great video if you love baby animals - especially pandas. It videos the birth and the little panda's growth every step of the way. Makes you wish you were there to hold the tiny thing. So cute as it shows the growth stages and fur coming in, and the adult pandas interesting love story. This is a very commplete story and lays a good foundation, great on detail. Great gift for someone who loves pandas."
1,Wrong,"As a professional historian (Honours, MA, PhD) I can only say this book is wrong on so many counts it should never have been published. It is an exercise in bias and mythologising and does the publisher no credit."
5,Fantastic New Book by Carol Stover,"Collectors of small dolls from the 50's have been waiting for this book!! With great attention to detail, Carol Stover covers the dolls of 47 different companies of the time period, plus extras, like advertising dolls. Marked and unmarked dolls are carefully described and amply illustrated with many, many color photos of each type. Copies of old advertising brochures are also included. This thorough, comprehensive, well-researched book deserves a place on every collectors shelf!"
2,"Oh, so disappointing",You know those little cloth squares you get to clean your glasses when you buy a new pair? Here's another one of those.
2,Slightly better video quality than original 'Kickboxing Academy',"A re-release of the really bad 1997 movie Kick-Boxing Academy as an attempt to capitalize on the recent incestuous themed controversy that surrounds the movie due to Chyler Leigh playing the love-interest of her real-life brother Chris. The new notoriety is due largely to Chyler landing a high profile role as a cast member of the popular TV show Grey's Anatomy.Really no difference from the original that I can tell (no added footage nor bonus features) but the video quality is noticeably better, though still not great for a DVD. The often embarrassing B-movie (Chyler won't even put it on her resume) deserves 1 star, but gave it 2 for the improvement in video quality."
2,Mind numbing-slow,"Too much instruction on basics, with no option for routines without. I was looking for a smooth flowing routine for someone with flexibility restrictions. Just eliminating the blank screen transition and title page for every pose would help. I was very disappointed and again another waste of my money."
1,dvd is messed up,"I had the same problem with audio / video sync. about 15-20 seconds into the pose the audio starts over from the beginning so while the model starts bending into whatever pose, the narrator is back at the top telling you to stand straight in mountain pose... I would turn off the audio, but then how are you supposed to know what to do? keep looking back at the screen all the time? I'm returning it."
1,No Flow!,"It may have over 35 workouts, but they're all comprised of a basic set of routines that are cobbled together. There's no flow to the workouts. The workout sequences are spliced together so that one pose ends before another frame begins.For example, there's one routine where you lie on your back, hold a belt stretched between both hands,pull it over your head, stretch, and then pull it back over to the starting position. That's it. The sequence ends and the next pose queues up and begins.A lot of the poses are good, but there is no flow to the routine."
2,Just in case there's any doubt...,"...let me reiterate that this is just a mess. A great idea, if the DVD worked properly - but the audio is out of sync with the video on my copy as well. Luckily, I bought it used and didn't pay full price, but the whole thing is completely useless and I have not gotten one bit of use out of it. My first entirely negative buying experience on Amazon (other than the fact that I did receive the item)!"
4,Where did you go?,"This is a CD single of the #25 hit from 1995. It is a techno-dance version of a traditional bluegrass song. There are six mixes of the song on this CD. Here is the complete track listing:1. ""Cotton Eye Joe"" (Radio Version)2. ""Cotton Eye Joe"" (Madcow Mix)3. ""Cotton Eye Joe"" (Armand's Dosey-Doe Mix)4. ""Cotton Eye Joe"" (Overworked Mix)5. ""Cotton Eye Joe"" (Armand's Funky Trance Mix)6. ""Cotton Eye Joe"" (Slide to the Side Mix)"
2,Germany Britney Spears and N Sync,"Modern Talking has never been a sophisticated synth pop nor do they intend to be but their early efforts provide them a good place and respect in the eurodance groups scale. I think the problem with this album is the large amount of songs that it has. It would have been a better album or EP if they kept the only 5 good (not excellent) dance songs it contains. The album is very repetitive and it seems like the MT guys only had a drum machine with 2 patterns because is the same pattern in all the songs. Even if they selected only 5 songs this songs are dance songs that except from China in her eyes and Fly to the moon will make you dance but inmediately after that will be forgotten. Nothing remarkable or trend setting. I'm sorry but this songs are just like listening to Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears and all the other many teen and bubble gum groups out there."
5,Another Fabulous Song From BSB,"One of the best tracks on their recent album - Never Gone, and this is a great album. Their music has matured and and aged with the fans. Truly a great track, and a highly reccomended buy. Hoping Siberia will be their next release from the album."
5,"I Still, Part 2",the remixes are always better than the orginal release....this one did not disappoint. as always...vocals that gives me goose bumps!can't wait for their next album. and their solo albums. amazing vocals!! thanks BSB!!!!
4,Love it!,Great bracelet for a great price. Ive gotten many compliments on it.The stones are beautiful and it is very comfortable to wear.
5,Love'd it!,"Loved it so much had to buy more! Color is excellent fun to wear.Shipping was fast, thank you"
1,devastating marine life only for vanity?,It is very pretty but it is unbelievable sad marine life is at danger only for vanity purposes such as jewerly
3,Falling Asleep,"It just never seem to catch on. i mean i thought it would be more about the dreams not the inter relationship between the 2 level fives. it did not get really intersting until almost the end. it did however, keep me interested enough to read on."
5,Jayne Ann shines,"I really enjoyed this book. After several so-so ones of late, it's great to see her back in her usual style of witty, intriquing books. I noticed this book was a lot longer than her last few books, which seemed rushed to me.A great read from a great writer."
1,Cannot believe JAK wrote it.,I usually love JAK books but this book was the dullest book I have ever read. It took me a month to read it when I usually read her books it a 3-5 hour session. I think the reason I did not like it was there was in my opinion too much detail about the dream levels and the heroines family/friends were not likeable. I also think the book missed her trademark sense of humor.
4,Very Good,"I won't tell you about the book, since everyone else has. It was a good book. Good plot, good charaters. I recommend this book."
3,Great to learn about dream interpretations from the characters,"I loved the interactions between all of the dreamers. It was great to learn about dreaming and interpreting dreams and relating it to the characters' actions and motivations. The end fizzed out a bit for me (too much ""morning after"" how it really happened and who knew what when), but I can take a little fizz from an author like Jayne Ann Krentz. Enjoyed the book and am looking forward to another book by JAK soon."
1,Explain this novel please,"The novel overall was fair. However, the dreaming aspect of it was complete gibberish and hard to understand. The characters were typical JAK (fiesty heroine/dominant hero). The ending was a complete surprise and partly redeemed the mass confusion of the rest of the novel. The reviewers who claim this is her best novel yet need to re-read Truth or Dare and it's sequel or any her Jayne Castle books."
2,Not very good,"I do not understand how all the reviews above say this is one of her best books....unless they all read the Jayne Castle books. I have not. I have read all of Jayne Krentz books and I have enjoyed every one. This one spent too much time in a fantasy dream world. Usually she has some type of fantasy, but the characters are usually better and the story is usually easy to follow. I did not care about any of this story's characters or about all the level five dreaming. In her last book there was some paranormal stuff but she explained it quickly and then the story moved on. In this one she constantly has to tell more about the level five stuff.....and it was very tedious.The end was good though, I did not expect the who dun it person. She weaved that quite well."
1,The title's the only good thing about this book,"I typically enjoy this author's work - so this was a major disappointment! Either go whole hog with the paranormal stuff in dreams - at least that would've been interesting - or pick a different device to hang the boy-meets-girl plot on.Really, nothing original in this work."
2,difficult to get through,"I usually like this author but this book was a difficult one to read. I found the ""Level 5 lucid dreaming"" subject pretty boring and difficult to follow. At first it seemed like it had some potential but was never able to follow through. I just never found myself drawn into the story or the romance."
1,Stinko,This was the worse book I have ever read by Jayne Ann KrentzI think she took a vacation and let someone else try to writeDIDN'T work I usually pass good book on this went in the trashsorry
2,"""Falling Asleep""","I was very disappointed in this novel. I'm a longtime Krentz fan, in all her guises, and found this so boring I didn't finish it. If she's going to segue into more of a mystery venue then I wish she'd just do it and drop the cutsey stuff. She certainly has the talent and experience to do so. This just put me to sleep."
2,Falling Awake,I was very disapointed in this book. Maybe because I read the Kindel version. I kept going back pages to see if I skipped over a page in error because I felt like I was missing huge sections at a time of what was going on. It felt choppy and unfinished. This book didn't have Jayne's usual flow.
1,Dreaming,I was dreaming to even read this book! This is not the usual read for me. I was caught by the title. I had used dream analysis with the help of a Jungian therapist and thought this book would be similar. It is not! I never did figure out what the levels in the book represented or did. There was no suspense to the drama. It went as predicted and all the characters opened up and told everything. Police work would be a lot simpler if real crimnals did the same thing! The main characters were perfect. Thank goodness real life isn't this boring!
1,RIPPED OFF,"the brand of lipstick my wife uses was no longer available locally. I found it on Amazon. It listed a package of two tubes for $17.49. The price was close, as my wife was paying about $5.00 a tube. In ordering it on Amazon, I was forwarded to Worlh Shoppers which listed a package of this lipstick for $17.49. I completed the order and when it arrived I was suprised to find only one tube in the package. $17.49 for a tube of $5.00 lipstick.I will never buy from World Shopper again, and using Amazon is marginal at best. Raynond Mally"
2,I havent seen it yet but so far....,"So far this moive looks good...but it seems simalar to ""poison ivy"" Which was the best of them all, It seems like a good suspenser but it also is unreal .no one would be stupid enough to fall for the same game.Besides...maybe im wrong maybe its NOT a good suspenser..i mean look at the reviews they say nothing about it except how Fake Plastic Jamie Pressly Who Has The Same Material Body As Barbie Doll (litterally) screws everyone (ugh) I dont know about this one..."
4,"The Best ""Poison Ivy"" so far.","Clearly the the most erotic of the ""Poison Ivy""movies. Jaime Pressly who plays Violet really takes the movie toanother level. Lets not forget Athena Massey who plays her mother who is also HOT. Megan Edwards played her role well as Joy but dose not show any skin, not that she needed to she was really sexy. The DVD has both the Unrated and R-rated versions and bot fullscreen and widescreen formats, It has no other options like commentary. Buy it if you are a fan of the ""Poison Ivy"" movies and if you want to see how HOT is Jaime Pressly.(took off one start 'cuse there is no Commentary)"
3,This Franchise Has run Its Course,"The first installment in this series with Drew Barrymore was the best. The rest have been ok and this one is no exeption.Jaime Pressley is the best thing about this film as the storyitself is pretty much a rehash of the same old theme. As for adding it to your collection, You could do worse. One thing isfor sure, Jaime is a looker. Charlie Spivey"
5,Awesome case!!,"I had my doubts from this case since it didn't have any reviews when I bought it. The main reason I decided to get it was because of how good it looks (in my opinion is very cool). One minute after picking it up I knew it was the right choice, it's easy to put, has the perfect fit, it's sticky enough so the phone wont slip from the hand, but not as much to feel that you're holding chewing gum, the side buttons and everyting on the phone's edges are still easy to use, and most importantly, it doesn't interfere to use the screen. Completly satisfied with the product."
2,a disappointing and frustrating read,"Philip Lieberman tries desperatly to make this book accessible and ultimately fails. Although his knowledge is extensive and most likely fascinating under other circumstances , I found his ""proof"" so extremely unorganized and out of place , that I ultimately stopped caring . All 151 pages of this book were pure torture ."
5,Excellent book!,"Excellent! Regardless of age, there's always something new you can learn. I recommend this book to my students (who usually get their ""facts"" mixed up."
1,WOW-------AMAZING!!!!!!!!,I find it amazing that someone could write such a boring book. It was drawn out and flat out boring. I think there is a sequal coming out----watch out!!!!! This book I fuound to be a waste of time for me and also for the publisher. I think he has better things to do than to waste his time on this. Two thumbs down for susie!
2,Disappointed,"This is the very 1st Star Trek book that I've read. Although I find the story interesting, I can't help but be disappointed with all the terminology that relates to the authors being Jewish. Nothing against the Jewish religion, I just don't want to read a STAR TREK book and have so much of it forced on me. I was fed up with it and not even halfway through the book! Leave that stuff out, and you have what I hope is a bonafide Star Trek story."
1,How can . . . ?,"HOW CAN an author, or two authors in this case, get a book this bad published. I bought it as a bargain book and it was still over priced. Very flat, boring story line with dialogue that had every bad cliche one can imagine. Overt religion was never part of Star Trek and should not be! If you want to read about the desert buy Dune and read it again. Four thumbs down."
5,"As a longtime Trekker and Vulcan fan, I loved this book.","Vulcan's Forge is one of the best Star Trek novels I have ever read. (The other best one is Sarek, by A.C. Crispin.)"
5,WHAT A GREAT STORY,WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU NERDBOMBERS WHO GAVE THIS BOOK BAD REVEIWS IT WAS GREAT AND I HAPPEN TO LOVE IT SO THINK AGAIN! :)
4,The definitive Spock story,"Here is the story that will delight spock fans everywhere. In this very excellent novel, Spock's life choices are explored, from his beginnings as a child, to the living legend he has become. The story is set both in the present and the past, and both complement each other well - showing us there is a clue to the present in the past. The real gem is the relationship of Spock and his father and the argument he had which has lasted for over 18 years. Maybe this sounds familiar, but the novel sheds some light and provides more detail into this part of Spock's life which has only been hinted on elsewhere. It would be interesting to see where the novels go from here."
3,Spock searching for Spock,A very interesting story that was actually two stories in one almost. It is a great origin story on how Spock was first introduced to Starfleet as a boy and an excellent story on the dealings of his emotions looking for approval from his father Sarek. A great in depth on charcater development on the warring emotional half human side of Spock and his logical side as well.It was nice to see Uhura shine and there are always the quick quips of Dr. McCoy to laugh over.The overall story was a little weak and very predictable. The story is set up in a way where there are no major suprises. I think this book was more of a fill-in book on the some of the missing years between the disaperance of Kirk and when Spock becomes an Ambassador.
2,A 'not very exciting' Star Trek novel,"I just couldn't get into this book, as for the most part it was so boring. The superb characterisations were almost a redeeming feature, namely Spock, Uhura and Captain David Rabin, but that alone does not make for exciting reading. Some interesting set pieces. Commander Uhura left in charge of the USS Intrepid goes up against a Klingon ship. There is some insight into Spock's background but it was far from engrossing and left you gasping for some in depth anecdotes about his Starfleet Academy years and not about his sketchy reasons for joining Starfleet. There's his well established prickly relationship with his father Sarek but there was little else of interest. David Rabin's suggestion of Starfleet as a career not withstanding.I'm sorry we've yet to see the definitive Spock novel, this is not it."
5,Incredible amounts of information,A comprehensive collection of cartographic information related to Armenian History and Geography. The acompaning text is also very informative.
2,"endless facts, sources, and names.......but it all goes nowhere","I enjoyed reading the book at first, but after about 75 pages I simply couldn't stand it anymore. Maybe I just didn't know enough before picking up the book, but I was completely lost in the deluge of names, titles, and politics of France. I skipped far ahead in the book and it still seemed to lead nowhere. Eventually I skipped to the end...even that seemed uneventful.Now if your obsessive about French politics and Pierre Plantard you might feel like your in heaven when you read this, it just didn't work out that well for me.Also noticeable was a nearly complete lack of maps, photos, or graphics. These would have broken the book up nicely and provided a break from the endless amount of teasing, yet ultimatly non-connecting facts and names.If possible, you might want to pre-read a few of the pages if they are available on amazon. It might give you an idea of how the book is structured throughout."
2,Lost.,"I am afraid that I don't get this book. It seems to be material moulded to fit the preconceptions or the aims of the authors. The writing style is dense, but the story just didn't make me want to finish it, not matter how hard I tried.For me it just seemed to be faction, rather than facts, mixed with what the authors wanted the story to be. I can only hope for more actual source material, because for me it is an interesting story and I am sure there must be more to it than what these authors make it out to be. I am giving it 2 stars, because there were a few tidbits which I was able to use as the basis for further research of my own."
1,"Picknett & Prince ""protesteth too much""","Picknett & Prince have produced, in The Sion Revelation, another item in the debunking of Pierre Plantard genre that fails to conclude a convincing argument. Indeed, The Sion Revelation is no revelation at all, but a blatant attempt to convince the readers that Plantard was a charlatan; however, their arguments against his veracity in the end merely leave one wondering if Pinknett & Prince ""protesteth too much."" At no point do the authors of this droll account consider that Plantard might have been exactly who and what he said he was, and that his disclosure of spurious documents might have covered a hidden aggenda. In the final analysis, however, it is unimportant whether or not Plantard was a charlatan or authentic. What is important is that authors such as Pinknett & Prince do a great disservice to an important topic by utilizing a so-called ""history"" to defame a character, rather than to elucidate and inform their unfortunate readers."
3,Come on........,"While the book is well written, most of the information in it is available elsewhere and will be familiar to afficianados of Rennes-Le-Chateau. And for anyone expecting some sort of breakthrough, the book's climax is a huge let down. According to the authors, the historical goal of the Priory of Sion and its supporters, assuming they exist, is a unified Europe. That's it. I kid you not. So they've pretty much accomplished what they set out to do, and have now quietly retired into the sunset. I wish things really were that simple. I'm quite sure the authors know they aren't...but they simply didn't know where else to go....."
3,Everything is a conspiracy,"I readThe Sion Revelation: The Truth About the Guardians of Christ's Sacred Bloodline,The Rozabal Line,The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy GrailandThe Jesus Papers: Exposing the Greatest Cover-Up in History (Plus)within the space of a couple of months. It seems to me that everyone is so busy finding a ""cover up"" by the Church that the actual value of the teachings of Jesus has been given secondary treatment. Maybe it's time to sit back and focus on ""what is visible"" rather than the ""invisible""? I will not go into the quality of the writing of ""The Sion Revelation"" because this has been covered by other reviewers of this book. What I will say is that maybe we are reaching a point when dubbing everything as a conspiracy is a getting a little mundane?"
3,Where is the Closed Captioning????,"This movie is entertaining enough to hold your interest. I purchased it to show my students who are deaf, but to my dismay- there is no closed captioning! This is unacceptable! They make a movie with an actress who is deaf and then they don't caption the DVD for other individuals who are deaf to be able to access the content?! I was very disappointed- and very tired- after I had to interpret the entire film for my class. I hope the ""powers that be"" will remedy this soon."
3,Marlie Matlin fan,"The movie was alright, not the most interesting story she has presented but it was based on a true story."
5,Not in Kansas Anymore!,"This is a delightful book! As a big Oz fan when I was a child, it was great to see all the characters and stories I grew up with come alive again. There are segments from pretty much all the Baum authored books (not the ones by other authors after his death), and great quotes dealing with all kinds of subjects pertinent to children and adults alike, such as intelligence, courage, etc. As an adult, I really enjoyed reading the ""Other Voices"" segments, where various people comment on Oz and 'what it means'. My favorite entry is the television summary of the 1939 movie by the Marin Independent Journal (p 72): ""Transported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first woman she meets, then teams up with three complete strangers to kill again."" If that is not the ultimate in revisionism, I don't know what is. Entertaining and well worth reading."
4,Cute Book,I purchased this as a prize for a Wizard of Oz evening event. It was a cute addition to a themed gift basket. It has pages of quotes and wisdom from the books - not the movie.
3,"Not for beginners, but VERY YUMMY!","My husband bought this for me a few years ago. I have baked maybe 10 or 15 of the recipes. As other posters state, most of his recipes call for fresh yeast. My local grocery does carry it, but it is almost always expired. Proofing the active dry yeast adds 10 minutes to the prep time. I have not had any issues with the breads being too salty. I also have not had issues with the bread coming out too dense - don't pack the flour! Flour should be sifted!Most of the recipes that I have tried call for way too much of the add-ins. As an example, the Tomato Garlic Foccacia calls for 6 plum tomatoes, and I used less than 3. Other issues I have had deal with the directions for how much to flatten the dough after the first rise.Other than these problems, I love the flavors of the breads. There are about 5 recipes that I LOVE, and I make them at least 3 times a month."
2,Great photos,"I gave this book two stars because it has great photos. The recipes, however, are weak. Most feature an extravagant amount of butter."
1,baaaaaaaaaad,"i was informed that this would be the game to outbeat battlefeild 1942, so i picked up a copy, the box looked good enough. well i'm sorry but i am not a fan of soldner, its to sloppy, its not clean cut at all, you start the game and you find yourself waiting forever to load, walking forever to find anyone, when you do find someone the shooting lasts 5 seconds, then you either walk miles to find another, or walk miles to get back from the starting point. i really dislike this game and i'm going to stick with Battlefeild for my war mongering"
1,Poor at Best,"I bought this game hoping that it would be a winner like the Battle Field series, or MOHAA. I was VERY disappointed.. The game claims to have realistic damage and many differnt vehicles/aircraft to fly. While their are many different vehicles, they all act alike.. They are difficult at best to control and the details are horrible. The liflike damage is poor, but you can level a whole town with an Abrams, unlike some other war games. This game is not worth the money, go out and buy a game like the Battlefield series, or the MOHAA series. The only thing good I can say about this game is that I am glad that I only paid 38 for this, instead of it's original 50 price tag."
1,AVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE PLAGE,"Single player doesn't work (officialy posted - on Jowood's tech forums), And multiplayer disconnects you after 10-15 mins. The vehicle control system is buggy and untested, and the animation (or lack of it is apparent in every frame), which isn't very fast either.Couple this with very long loading times indeed, and high the probability of having to shell out for ANOTHER upgrade just to play this title, leaves you with this advice:-AVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE PLAGEBuy Operation Flashpoint/Battlefield 1942 if you want proper examples of how a tactical FPS should be produced.Both titles can be picked up on this site for much less than this poor excuse of a game."
3,Too old,"After playing so many of the ghost recon, delta force and other games like that this was a little dissapointing."
5,Better have LOTS of space!!!,"I got mine for less than $50, right after the price went to $70, don't understand why.Anyway.....Pack contained everything needed to launch your rocket. Engine, wadding, igniters & igniter plugs.You may or may not know, most rockets can be launched with the A, B or C series engines (each next letter is twice as powerful as the prior) D and E engines are for MUCH larger rockets.The A engines are pretty wimpish, all right for a windy day or a limited space area. The B engines are pretty decent.The C engines... holy crap!!! WAAAYYYYYY up!!! Have LOTS of room.Got this & a couple of rockets for my kids for Christmas & they loved it. Great show of propulsion, trajectory, wind effect, etc..."
4,"great launch pad, but the rocket, well....","when i got this rocket, the launch pad worked well, infact to this day i still use it, but the rocket went up about 10 feet and exploded into a million peices. come to find out, we stuffed way to much wadding in it. i am a rocket collector, and this is a good starter rocket."
1,HORRIBLE COMPANY,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. I ORDERED SOMETHING FROM THEM AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE HERE IN A WEEK. 3 WEEKS LATER AND 2 E-MAILS, I HAVE HEARD AND SEEN NOTHING, STAY AWAY!"
5,Chevy guys....you need this in your resto library,I have a ton of restoration and numbers books as I do vettes and camaros and you have to have these to stay out of traps. This is one of the better overall references unless you are in to NCRS restoration then you need the year by year NCRS guides.Its a big book but contains most of the numbers you really need. I have found errors in the Camaro white book.Best Camaro guides for 67-69 are authored by Jerry MacNeish which most Camaro Collectors already know.
4,What I need to know about Chevys,"Following 40 years of our enthusiasm with American Motor drag racing and collection we purchased a 1960 Chevy Impala 12 months ago, now what? From a small block AMC 401 to a Chevy Big Block 348 tri-power; there was a lot to be learned. Following a few presentations to the public and writing the jumbo amount of questions I received I decided we needed a book. What are the variety of BigBlocks? What year and what models had the 348 tri-power, how important was the 4 speed floor shifter? We needed to open our minds, and we did. Amazon.com is the most excellent location of books, ever. The ""Chevrolet by the Numbers"" is very detailed, simple to understand and research, and especially, the condition and shipping was excellent.Now when we are approached at the multi car events here in Florida we can address everyone with a smile as we answer the questions! Now we know how to repair its horn!"
5,Outstanding and thourough,"This book is exceptional and details all the finer points that you must know when thinking about, or have purchased one of these fine cars. Take the time and read through this book and it will give you years of knowledge. The book will also educate you as to the correctness of the Chevrolet you either have, or are looking at. It also will help verify myths with acctual facts and documentation as tho the true nature of the cars and their history."
5,hubbys book,hubby got new old car and loves to know everything about the car before he starts to redo it or as I say tear into it and make it his own
5,Male Enhancement,"A hilariously poignant - and pleasantly pessimistic - tale of one man's rise through New York's publishing industry circuit. Touching at times, yet always temperamental, Izkoff's skewed view on life, liberty and the pursuit of getting laid gracefully skirts the fine line between raunch and redemption, providing a captivating read in the process. An insightful peek behind the headlines and hijinks at Dennis Publishing, it comes highly recommended."
4,"What a fun read, I read it all in one evening",I loved this story about a young fellow who keeps on making his life work. It is so interesting to read about the depression and obstacles and the positive outcome of his life. I'd love to see it as a film. It's a great story for young people
3,This item runs small,"I ordered my son's usual hat size, but this hat was too tight. I will have to order up half a size to get one that fits."
4,Surpasses first effort,"Peter Jenkins becomes more comfortable as a writer. His ability to express himself with more range benefits his descriptions. Though his newly acquired wife may perhaps sidetrack the ""walk"" , this adventure remains generally untainted.I enjoyed the first, this one was more absorbing."
3,Needed,"If you read the first book, you will need to read this one to see how the story ends. A little disapointed that there was a Part 2 in the first place"
2,Not a hardcover!!!,"Don't be misguided by the description - this is not a ""hardcover"" book. It's pocket size is nice to enable you to carry it around but it has that cheap looking flexible plastic cover. The book itself is good but I am disappointed in the binding."
4,Wonderful reference for CPE Chaplains,This was an invaluable reference during my CPE residency. I would recommend it for anyone who ministers to Catholic patients.
5,OUTSTANDING!,"INTERESTING dance music, but also wonderful to play as background music throughout the day."
4,Bellydance music -- good!,The CD came quickly and is as advertised....interesting music with the right kinds of rhythms and sounds for practicing one's bellydance exercises....
2,"It's okay, but doesn't sound like bellydance to me","I was hoping this would be techno or ambient versions of bellydance beats and a few songs are, but most are just Arabic pop sounding."
1,Ridiculously overpriced.,"Wow! Amazon is selling Lion Brand Jiffy for $9.20? It's regular price at Jo-ann's is $3.99, I believe. I just went to Joann.com, and Jiffy waslisted as $3.29 reg. price."
2,Small roll and expensive,Ordered 4 rolls for $5 each. I thought they were bigger than they were so I had to order another 4. The price went from $5 to $5.50. Today the price is over $9. Something is wrong with this listing. Not too happy with purchase.
1,Newest edition needs severe editing,"Tough book to learn from due to all the mistakes in the text and workbook answer key. Mislabeled pictures, tons of spelling and grammar mistakes, incorrect, ambiguous and conflicting info presented. Every chapter has mistakes. An editing nightmare. My whole class and instructors want to pull our hair out. I don't recommend this book to any program director. Unfortunately we are too far into it and are stuck with weeding through the mistakes. Too bad, I heard the 4th edition was very good."
5,Great service!,"This seller is the best so far. I ordered the book on February 24th and it was delivered on February 26th. the book was in perfect condition, brand new still in the plastic wrap. i wish this seller had all the books i needed. would definitely do business with this seller again. very honest too."
3,Better than nothing,"Beautiful illustrations! My 3 year old enjoys looking at the pictures. But, I'm disappointed with the storytelling. I've read many of these stories as a child and wanted to share them with my son. But, I found the style long on words and a bit tedious. Older versions of these tales told in a straight-forward manner made for livelier story-telling. Many of these stories are half as long in older translations than what appears here. I would not recommend this were it not the ONLY easily available book on Filipino stories for children."
5,Richness in the Written Word!,Wonderful book of stories! Just right for children to have as they learn about their heritage.
5,Excellent classroom read aloud stories,The stories in this book were excellent folktales from the Filipino culture. My second grade students are thoroughly enjoying them.
3,Expecting stories written in Filipino language,I was expecting that this book is written in Filipino language. It's actually written in English. The stories are Filipino versions of popular English stories.
1,I'm very unhappy with this book because it's not Tagalog.,"I'm very unhappy with this book because the stories are not written in tagalog. I wanted to return this. This is not the one I am looking for. The discription of this book is very misleading. I guess I should pay attention the title itself which is ""Filipino Children's Favorite Stories"". If you are a Filipino parent wanting to teach tagalog language to your kids, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
4,"I like it, but...","How many times can you bring Kirk back to life? Once again bringing the two legendary captains together worked well, and the threat of Federation breakdown has merit as dies the theory of Sarek's murder, but can Kirk continue to be the hero that he was years ago? I am a die hard reader of the Star Trek literature, and this is reaching for something, something not quite logical. And now I see that Kirk will be back again. Enough. Let him die. And stay dead."
1,A weak sequel.,"After Kirk's ""Return"" in the last novel, Paramont and Mr. Shatner have decided to milk it for all it is worth. This book is predictable and dull with nothing to say either to Star Trek fans or a larger audience. A real shame since ""Return"" wasn't half bad. The should have left well enough alone."
4,He dit it again!. . .but not as well as before,"I waited before I had all of the first three Shatner books before I started reading them, and I admit that this one, although not as good as the previous ones (""The Ashes of Eden"" & ""The Return""), ""Avenger"" did a great job at tying the previous, seemingly separate books together with itself, and each other.It had the same movie-like, epic atmosphere on it the prequels had, making the book an exiting read.On an analytical point of wiew though, some problems are revealed.The actual plot seems to be a bit ungroundet, and the action takes too much room from the story. The action advances the plot, but is a bit time-consuming.Nontheless the mood of the book stayes unique and interesting troughout the action, making this a good piece of storytelling.A good trilogy nontheless wich is every bit as good as it seems."
2,Crap Crap CRAP!!!,"Shater is so egotistical. Yeah right, like his fattness could have lasted with Picard for a second in a fight (The Return). Anyways, more ego trips for shatner in this book. It seems like he is trying to prove how great kirk is and all that..."
4,Shatner does good job,"Enjoyed ""Avenger"". It was the first book I have read by Shatner. It did sort of seem that he was trying to resurrect the old Kirk, Spock, McCoy tandem for a short while however. The book did flow well and did have a good storyline to keep the reader interested. While not a ""supurb"" book, it was enjoyable."
3,silly and fun,everyone needs to read a trash book once in a while. Its the kind of a book you can read in a bubble bath and if it falls in no big deal.Everybody all ready knows how it ends.
2,He's back again.,"Here we go again. When Shatner wrote ""The Return"" he actually did a better job than ""Generations"", but now he's just riding this horse a little too long. Kirk is back and he lives all the way through this one too. That's no surprise, because Shatner himself tells you on the first page that he's signed to do two more. If Kirk had died at the end of ""The Return"", then it would have been a masterpiece. ""Avenger"" is nothing more than fluff with a few NG characters thrown in to grab you"
2,Poor Spock.,"If you were to ask me, Shatner is abusing Characters. How many times has Kirk been resurected now? The thing that mainly got me disturbed about this book is that Shatner has reduced Spock beyond belief. At the end of ST 6 , we finally think that Spock has found a balance between his human and Vulcan sides. What's with all of this ""He'll have to deal with my human side"" junk? The virogen Crisis kept me reading, but this book is a far cry from The Return."
2,I don't like it.,"When I first read the book, I was excited. After a while, I wanted to put it away. I was disappointed about the way the story turned out. it seemed that the author was undermining a lot of characters and even a whole culture while at the same time glorifying one character. I also want to question several points. If Spock was affected by Bendii Syndrome, wouldn't have he want to kill his father's murderer. Don't tell me that the Vulcans have never arrested non-Vulcans. And why would Sarek want to mind-meld with Kirk as father to son.Ashes of Eden was okay. I even found The Return quite good. However, I found Avenger disappointing. If William Shatner entends to write two more books, I hope he considers the fact that Star Trek is about many characters and not just one.END"
3,Not a book review - but,"Just wanted to say that I received this book in very good condition and that it came very quickly. I appreciated that and the low cost. As for the contents of the book - I am sure those who like Star Trek will find it interesting since it contains quite a bit of connection to older stories. Of course, it is part of a series - so the best thing would be to read them all."
2,"Its ""to be continued""","The story isn't bad, a little disjointed at times, but when you near the end you realize the end is not near! I saw no indication on the cover or Amazon's info. to indicate the story was incomplete. I would think there should be some indication that this is one of a series, and where in the sequence it lies."
4,Lots of great action and suspence,"William Shatner has done an excellent job yet again. This book was fabulous! I especially liked the part where Kirk and the escaped from the Vulcan space dock\prison. There was also some great action such as the battle between the Tobias and the enemy ships in the atmosphere of Teilani's home planet.(I forgot what it was called, thought it had something to do with the children of heaven or something.) I myself am a fan of Mr. Shatner and have read Avenger, Return, Ashes of Eden, and am currently reading Spectre. This happens to be one of my most favorite Star Trek books."
4,An excellent book!,I am a die hard Trekker all the way and this book was excellent. I never thought that Shatner could make such a come back in the Star Trek world but he did. An excellent sequal to The Retun. I can't wait to read his new novel Spectre.
4,Shatner to the rescue....again.,"Shatner, along with the Reeves-Stevens, stick to the tried-and-true method of expanding upon old storylines from the TOS trek series. In this installment a virus spreads throughout the Federation destroying plant life and endangering the lives of billions. Picards Enterprise has little true involvement within the tale giving room for a new Starfleet vessel and her crew to take a more heavy role as they assist Kirk and his bloody-knuckle approach to solving a galactic size mystery.Many of the Shatner books do tend to be a little Super-Shatner-esk and this book is no different. But as always Judith and Garfield Reeves use their talents to bring Shatners imagination to life and reign in the super-ego. A good book and a good read. The second in a series but does well as a stand alone as well.ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED. THANKS AND GOOD READING."
4,Kirk & Spock together once more with Dr. McCoy!,"Overall, I would say the story line is quite tense, gripping and to my surprise...surprising! Who would guess that Kirk, Spock and McCoy are united once more. The only drawback is that we don't here any mention about Worf or DS9 (except for the Dominions)."
4,Imagine Jaco Meets Oregon,"Ditto on the other review. This is a really delightful album, particularly for the presence of Art Lande, an underappreciated and underrecorded genius who has never enjoyed the renown of other pianists who made such classic ECM albums as ""Red Lanta.""Lande and Oregon's Paul McCandless together are a dream team -- I wish they'd form a quartet. Rick Crittenden himself is a fine player, fluid and lyrical. The Jaco comparisons are inevitable -- his tone is decidedly post-Pastorius, and he uses harmonics as a melodic vehicle ways similar to Jaco's heartbreaking ""Portrait of Tracy."" But Crittenden is his own man, with a sweet compositional sense evident in ""Swiss Bell,"" which is reminiscent of some of Ralph Towner's melodies circa ""Roots in the Sky.""This album is superbly recorded. Not every track is as compelling as ""Swiss Bell,"" but all in all, this record should be snatched up by Oregon fans and those who are interested in what Lande's up to these days."
4,Ok for Filling Tacos,"I guess the intended use is to hold the tortilla while filling tacos. It works. I bought it thinking I could use it to crisp tortillas in the microwave in taco shape. For this, it doesn't work. The tortillas flop over!"
3,Works fairly well,"Bit of a learning curve, finding out just how much time required in microwave to get a crisp shell without it being tough."
1,Nothing,"Bad Movie, Bad action and you don't get to see almoust anything....tho words : money waisted"
3,You can't help but watch,"Guilty, guilty, the guiltiest of pleasures. I have to admit (and I'm not in any way shape or form proud of this) I love this movie. Yeah, the plot is contrived. The acting, when it isn't over the top is almost painfully stilted and forced but it is just great fun. However, on the up side, Gail O'Grady spends half the movie in a tight fitting swim suit.Don't expect a masterpiece. This movie is straight off the Lifetime Movie Channel so, of course, the schmuck husband (Midkiff) is a no damn good cheating liar. This guy has almost no redeeming qualities at all. And his stupidly transparent efforts to juggle a clingy wife (O'Grady) and his new girlfriend (Rinna) are so inept you just can't help but get sucked in.This movie is good fun to watch, especially on a rainy weekend when you have an hour or two to kill."
3,Not much of an apple taste,"Not as much of an apple taste as I would thought or liked, but still good :)"
2,Not hot enough,"I bought this unit because of the claims that it comes out extremely hot. The hottest I measured was 155 degrees F. The coffee tastes ok, but would be better if it was hotter. I live at 9000 ft about sea level so I'm not sure if that has something to do with it. I was also the victim of a bait and switch by the seller and received a lesser quality than was pictured."
1,Big Disappointment,"After having two $150.00 coffee makers breakdown after about 2 years of use each, I was in search for something a little better. The Capresso MT500 at $189.00 was immediately inferior to what I had in the past; and, I am returning it. The coffee picks up a plastic smell from the hot water and the carafe does not ever pour properly. Enough said.There does not seem to be a coffee maker that approaches professional grade for less than $900.00; and, this means you are buying a combo espresso,coffee,latte, grinder combo. Will somebody make a commercial grade coffee maker in the $300.00 range, PLEASE?!"
2,Disappointed in pot construction,Makes great coffee...but the neck of the coffee pot is so narrow only a six year old could get his hand in to clean the inside of the pot!
1,MAKER WAS GREAT FOR A WHILE THEN........,"the burner in the base started to smoke and burn. This after having the coffee maker for only 2 years! This was a huge dissapointment because it was expensive and I did like the product when it worked.Not now, would never buy another one. Buyer beware."
4,Good Coffeemaker,Overall a good coffee maker. Easy to use and clean. Does not make super hot coffee - drawback.
3,I expected more,"For almost $200 I thought this cofeemaker would be close to perfect. However, I find these disappointments: If you add water to the fill line, the thing overflows. As well, the carafe dribbles onto the countertop as you pour. A third complaint... The buttons are awkward to use when setting."
4,Fast and decent coffee,"What is the best thing about the Capresso MT-500? It brews an entire pot of coffee in record time. I think they state it is under 7 minutes; However, it seems almost immediate compared to my old coffee maker which took eons and eons. Also, the coffee it brews is quite good. At least, that is to say I am satisfied with it and I previously thought I had unattainable standards for 'decent' home-brewed coffee. Glad to know I was wrong. Is it worth the price? Of course not, but you know that's why you want it. Just kidding. Enjoy!!"
2,Good coffee... but the machine has issues,"I must agree with the others who have reviewed this machine that it does make very good coffee. However, despite making great coffee it is a very messy machine. After every batch of coffee I have to clean the inside of the flip top lid as coffee grinds back up and stick to it... yuck... nothing like wiping up wet mushy coffee grinds. Additionally, the water level gauge developed a nice green algae that I could not get rid of. I had the machine less than a year and passed it along to a friend as the maintenance was not worth it. Have reverted back to Krups to give them another try."
4,Great coffee maker!,I've owned the Capresso MT 500 for over 2 years now with daily use making at least 2 pots each day. My understanding is the Capresso is stainless steel lined so your water isn't in contact with aluminum in the heating/brewing process ever. It heats the water hotter than other coffeemakers we've owned and stainless steel thermal carafe does a decent job of keeping coffee hot enough. If it retained the amount of heat in the carafe a bit better this would be a 5. Fresh off the brewing gives you a great hot cup of coffee and it's important to me that there's no possibility of aluminum leaching anywhere into my coffee.It has also lasted longer than any of our previous machines. The timer is easy to use although a bit on the small side. We like this product so much that we purchased a spare recently in the event it breaks although it shows no sign of it. Another plus is cleaning the system is rarely necessary and my product has a spot for a water filter.
4,"Great product, coffee could be hotter",This is our second Capresso. Very nice and does not overflow if the filter holder and gold filter are placed correctly in the top. Also the metal pot should be closed and placed properly under the spout. The only little critique is that the coffee could be a little hotter.
1,not worth the money,"No matter what I did, coffee does not stay hot long enough. Hot water in the thermos before I make the coffee did nothing! I also tried more expensive coffee and the taste was no better than the 15.00 dollar Mr. Coffee I have Not worth the money but I guess I am stuck with it."
5,Very satisfied customers,"I bought this for my husband two years ago and have not regretted it ever. For the first time today I discovered some mold in the area around where the reusable filter sits -- cleaning it out was a breeze. Everything came out easily for cleaning and went back in place again with no issues. The thermal carafe keeps our coffee super-warm for HOURS when we need it to.A solid purchase that I am very pleased with, and very reasonably priced."
1,"Erratic performance, poor customer service from Capresso","I'm getting ready to box up and return this machine. Here's the story:After my MT-500 started performing erratically, I contacted Capresso by phone and e-mail.The company's entire customer-service department seems to be a voicemail message in New Jersey. Though the voice insists you'll get a call back if you leave a message, no one ever returned my call. Likewise, an e-mail I sent got no response from Capresso.My MT-500 continues to hold water in the filter chamber rather than send it through to the coffee pot. I'm preparing to return it and buy another Krups machine instead; they may seem a little more basic than Capresso, but they're reliable, and their customer service at least exists."
2,PLEASE READ BEFORE DECIDING,"I'll make this quick. I spent hours researching this coffee maker, and I made the mistake of ignoring the few poor reviews. I am not slow, nor am I a walking zombie before I've had my coffee in the morning. Since I've had this machine, I have had three occasions where I have had major spills thanks to misallignment of caraf in the machine. Hot coffee everywhere- on the counter, spilling down into drawers, etc. It is just no fun. Finally this last go around, the coffee actually spilled into the poorly placed control panel and shorted out the whole thing. I would NOT recomment this unit to anyone.I recently stayed at a rental that had an old school Bunn coffee maker..... what I difference. Faster easier to clean, and fool proof."
3,not a good machine if you like STRONG coffee,"We bought this machine at our local coffee place, and were pretty disappointed to discover that, if you fill the filter with enough coffee for very strong brew, it gets caked all over the inside of the top piece where the hot water comes out and into the filter, this part lifts up so you can put both water and coffee in from the top. It is fine if we are making 6 cups, but barely, and we still have to wipe the coffee grinds off of the inside of the lid daily. When we have company we have to make two pots for 10 cups. If my cafe had a return policy that allowed it to be returned after we tried it, I would definitely have returned it. That said, when I say strong I mean strong - ie 1 very heaping large spoon of fine grind per ""cup"" of coffee as the machine measures it. If you like it much weaker than this, then this machine is probably great for you. Easy timer, nice looking, fairly quick."
2,Mixed feelings,"We had a Capresso coffeemaker for almost a decade. That model worked until the plastic bits that held the reservoir broke and then we just taped the reservoir in place to keep well-meaning friends from trying to take it off the unit to fill with water. I wish I'd kept that ancient thing.We've had this machine long enough to have gone through all the cycles of ownership: the initial excitement, the first disappointment when the a single coffee ground caused several cups of coffee to flow over the cap and onto the counter, and now the continuing irritation of its inability to brew a full pot.I could live with having to make certain the basket/holder/filter area were spotless with every brewing; I am about to chuck it because it now takes four tries to get my morning carafe of coffee brewed.I'll keep the carafe. Coffee stays hot for hours in it. I just wish the mechanism lived up to the carafe. It would be a four-star machine. As it is, I give it a two."
1,disappointed,"After about 6 months of use, this coffee maker quit. I've had Cuisinart grind and brews in the past and didn't want to deal with the messy grounds and cleaning. The Capresso worked great and made a decent cup of coffee for a couple of months, then started slowing down and not brewing all of the water in the water tank. Cleaned it, it worked well again for a couple of months then finally quit. Also, inevitablly whenever the carafe was removed to pour coffee, several remaining drops from the basket would drip on the base. I never had any problems with pouring or temperature as others have reported. I was hoping this coffee maker would last at least 5 years. My husband threw away the box, so I don't have any warrranty info. Any suggestions?"
2,Disappointing Coffee Quality,"The coffee quality is mediocre at best, with a consistently off-taste. I don't know if it's temperature issue or a flow issue, but I get much better tasting coffee from a drip cone. Also, the thermal carafe does a poor job keeping coffee warm. It's barely lukewarm just an hour later. Otherwise, a good looking machine and the timer works fine. None of the overflow problems mentioned by others (except when I've forgotten to put the carafe in place, and that's pure user error). Still, I would absolutely NOT recommend this machine given the very poor coffee quality/price ratio."
4,Loving my hot coffee,"So far, so good. We've gone through so many coffee makers, it's not funny. Last one was recalled by Starbucks. This makes a good, hot pot of coffee. The only problem with it is you have to be careful about cleaning the filter holder because if grounds get stuck in it, the sneak a cup while it's dripping function doesn't work and coffee gets deposited all over the counter. If you're careful about cleaning it, this problem doesn't happen. Here's hoping it lasts more than a year."
5,Capresso coffeemaker,"This machine is fantastic! Makes great coffee, easy to use and looks good on counter top."
2,Coffee tepid after an hour,"Brews fast and hot, but the coffee cooled off too quickly in the carafe. The outside of the carafe is warm to the touch and coffee was tepid after an hour and room temperature after 2 or 3 hours."
5,10-cup coffeemaker,"This is a great product. It keeps the coffee hot for hours and you don't get the ""burned"" coffee taste as it has not been on the heat; It cleans up really well after use. The only thing is I wish it held a little more coffee. But it brews the next pot quickly."
1,Too many design flaws,"I would not recommend this coffee maker. Reasons:1. If you use the gold filter and try to make strong coffee, it goes so fast that the coffee does not have time to drain through the grounds and it overflows all over the counter. The company when called said to use paper filters which did fix it but that's not the point.2. The carafe pours too slowly. If you tip it to get a faster pour, it runs back down the carafe outside and on to your foot.3. The valve where the coffee goes into the carafe is always sticking. Then when you remove the carafe it runs coffee all over the hot plate.4. It makes too little coffee for the amount of grounds used. I think this is because it goes so fast you have to use more coffee to get a strong cup."
2,Complicated,"I have owned this Coffeemaker for one week. I will admit it makes a great cup of coffee and the coffee does not get bitter. BUT, You must follow instructions completely and carefully, or you will have a very hot dangerous mess.The carafe must be closed with dots in a certain position for brewing. You must be sure the carafe is closed completely (dots again) to keep coffee warm. A few times we had the bottom of the filter get stuck and that caused an overflow of hot water and grounds. Once causing a burn. Now I must check the pop-up valve to be sure it is the correct position. There is no shut off button to stop the flow of hot water and hot grounds. I had a party and it was frustrating teaching everybody to open the coffee pot, much less help by making a pot. I would never make coffee without supervising.Too much hassle! Too many overflows and 1 burn."
2,unhappy user,"WE are avid coffee drinkers brewing probably too many pots a day. I would not buy or recommend this pot again and here are my reasons why. 1.) The red level ball rarely pops up, you need to tap the pot, 2.) The pot is extremely noisy when brewing, 3.) The water well is hard to fill, we ended up buying a pitcher to use, 4.) the lid is a pain always having to adjust for pouring or keeping warm, 5.) The coffee pours too slow, 6.) the filters are expensive and for the amt we brew we would be chaning filters once a week.We loved our Braun not sure why they quit making coffee pots.thanks"
2,Coffee Regular,"The Capresso (a) regularly leaks when pouring cofffee; (b) overflows from time to time; and (c) when you call Capresso for assistance, there is none. Whatever problems you have are your fault."
4,The Best,"All of us imagine the perfect coffee maker, but this is the only one that comes close. The necessary carafe and the appearance if you have a stainless steel kitchen.The design is perfect. My wife and I purchased an extra carafe ... she's on half-caf ... I'm on full-caf.Any negs you hear about the carafe not keeping the heat are nonsense ... I get my four oversized cups-in-the-morning and they're all perfect over a two-hour period ... good enough for me.We have no regrets ... the best coffee maker on the planet. The priority is taste and this machine delivers!"
2,False Editing,"This is one of Georgette Heyer's finest books-a take of a twin brother forced by his mother's debts and his brother's disappearance into a masquerade. For romance fans-it's a must read... just not on Kindle. The editing is possibly the worst I've ever seen. Paragraphs aren't indented, words are split up willy nilly and there are pages that appear to be one run on sentence. I spent good money on a book that's almost impossible to read in this form.Buy the paperback-not the Kindle version of this book."
4,Always a pleasure,"There are twin brothers born in the days of the regency in England, of course. One, the younger of the two, is an aspiring diplomate in Vienna. The other, a little more hedonistic, is the elder and thus the heir to the title. The younger brother ""knows"" something has gone amiss with his twin and hurries home, to discover that no one knows where the elder is. Mother persuades son to pretend to be the heir so that an arranged marriage can be initiated. Younger son falls for wife to be; brother finally arrives home; the jig is up--or is it? It is vintage Georgette Heyer--a world of carriages, and the ton, and vast estates; butlers and valets and convoluted ties. Heros and heroines may possibly hug and occasionally kiss; the rest is left to our imagination."
5,false colors,"Great story. It takes a little while to get used to the Regency period language. I loved this story when I was a young teenager, and now find its tale just as fun and interesting!"
5,False clours,"In this delightful romance Ms. Heyer has one twin taking the place at an engagement dinner for his brother who is missing. The problems arise when Kit has to continue with the deception. Naturally he and his twin's fiancee fall in love, with all of the difficulties typical of this sort of charade. The novel is great reading and of course, has a happy ending."
2,Don't Read This Heyer First For It Shall be Your Last,"Since this was my 16th Heyer book, it is safe for me to say that I will continue reading the Heyer books yet to be enjoyed. Had False Colours been my very first Heyer book I would never have purchased another. I would have deprived myself of many wonderful hours spent with such great characters so beautifully developed in her other books. If you are reading by Kindle, do get a free sample. If you have any interest after reading the non-stop breathless idiocy that spews forth from the mother of this plot, be certain that you will find much more of the same nonsense throughout the book. This book pales in comparison to her others and makes me wonder if it was actually meant to be a short story."
2,VERRRRRRYYYY SLOW.....,"This book was nothing like ""The Grand Sophy"". Very slow moving and boring. I rarely put a book down without finishing but this one is collecting dust now......"
2,"If you love exclamation points, read this book!","I found this book to be nearly impossible to read! Georgette Heyer's characters end nearly every sentence in an exclamation point! They don't converse with each other as much as shout to each other! Her characters end up sounding like simpletons!Honestly, the plethora of exclamation points in this book gave me a headache. At one point, I even considered grabbing a bottle of white-out to eliminate them. The time that would be required to obliterate their vast number, however, was prohibitive. Heyer can't hold a candle to Austen, nor to Anya Seton, and while Austen can write humor that is actually laugh-out-loud, Heyer's attempts to be amusing fall flat. I can't imagine picking up another book by Heyer - one was punishment enough."
4,Wonderfully balanced view of the world. Highly recommended.,"This history book is different in its effort to balance the treatment of each geographic area in the world. Most of the history books in English tend to look at the whole world from Western point of view. This book talks about Asia and Pacific Islands in an amazingly fresh and fair manner. There are plenty of pictures to please the eyes. The timeline at the beginning of each chapter is broken into parallel timelines on different continents in the world, which makes it very easy to have a general idea of time and space. I would recommend this book to any young reader, or even experienced reader, who likes to go on a pleasant trip back in time. After the reader finishes this book, another good book to follow is ""Roads to Xanadu""."
5,Perfect small anchor,The anchor is well constructed and has a good coat of galvanizing to last many years. I use it in inland waters and it works well.
4,Bar hopper reviews 8# galvanized anchor,"Great price, satisfactory anchor. Galvanizing not extremely heavy. Good light duty anchor. This is the third of this anchor I have bought. Grabs the bottom well."
1,HouseFly is very flimsy,This is a very flimsy product. The first time I tried to fly it it tipped over about 3 inches off the ground. It took $40 in parts to fix it. The seond time I was just trying to slowly increase speed and it tipped over again and broke the same part I replaced costing another $22. The company Megatech is of little help and the overseas owner really does not care. There are much better R/C Helicopters. I will never purchae another Megatch product.
3,Armenian Giants....,"If you're into the Armenian style of oud, hearing George Mgrdichian is a must. His attack is awesome and he gets strong support from soprano-saxaphonist Souren Baronian, a veteran of the New York middle-eastern/jazz fusion scene. The first three songs are excellent, making the CD a worthwhile purchase."
2,"Skimpy, unsatisfying","The pieces on this disk are strait-jacketed into a 3-minute pop time limit which doesn't allow any room for real improvisation or development. The performances are OK as far as they go, but that isn't very far. This is glossied-up Egyptian pop. Total disk time is quite low."
3,Let's Hope Dunn is Done with Prose Poetry,"While certainly better than the majority of pseudo-philosophical goop that passes itself off as poetry (or even worse--""prose poetry""), Riffs and Reciprocities was a disappointment, especially given the heights Dunn is capable of reaching in his work. We have to admire Dunn for attempting new styles/directions in his work and for not just recycling the most reader-friendly version of himself for his audience (as Billy Collins and Stephen Dobyns have, unfortunately, done with their latest efforts). But these prose pieces never aspire to much more than passing ruminations, and, at times, they come dangerously close to imitating ""Deep Thoughts"" by Jack Handy. Stick with Landscape at the End of the Century if you want to read Dunn at his finest. His poem ""On the Death of a Colleague"" is better than anything in his last two books."
4,You need this if you are owning a 900 or 1000cc Z-series Kawasaki,The only workshop manual currently available new for Kawasaki's famous Z900 and Z1000. All maintenance and repair work is described vey well and there is a wealth of helpful illustrations. Very useful!
5,Clymer motorcycle manual,"This is a how to manual for maintenance and repair on a motorcycle, specifically a 1980 Kawasaki KZ 1000. If you happen to own or purchase this bike I would strongly recommend getting this book. It has good illustrations and descriptions of nearly anything you want to do to maintain or repair your motorcycle."
3,luke warm,I am both a flamenco dancer and photographer. I am luke warm about this book. The layout was poor--the text was too wordy and the pictures seemed more like calendar art than fine art photographs. I owned this book for a month before selling it to a local book store. My advice is keep searching there must be better books out there.
2,worst than boring school text book,"This book is worst than school text book!!! Don't understand how others rated this book so highly. It is full of principles and theories vs. practicle real life informations. If you want to waste $$ or if your desire is to obtain dry, boring book to help you sleep, this is the one."
5,"Thorough, up to date (2000) and well written","This book was recommended as a textbook for a 4th year course in real estate development and it reads like one. It is well organized and covers this broad subject with detailed, practical information in a systematic way.Most of all I enjoyed the two real life case study storys (of the development of an office building and a high-rise apartment) that weave through the chapters. These were very candidly told by the developers themselves and give the real picture of the trials and tribulations of large project real estate development.Numerous listings of information sources, web sites, and bibliographies at the end of each section makes this book a 'keeper' reference text."
3,+1/2. Pretty-sounding modern Celtic pop,"Lovely vocals, although with somewhat overly-saccharine, synthy arrangements. It's too slick for me, but if you enjoy both the softer side of Sinead O'Connor and the rougher side (such as it is) of Enya, as well as the strange, alluring sound of the Celtic language, then this album might be for you."
5,brill,my bro loved it he thinks its the best book ever he loves playing guitars and thinks every one should own this
5,The world's first perfect stroller!!,"My husband and I already own a Swift (Inglesina's umbrella stroller), which we love. We keep it in the trunk and it's always there when we need it. I've searched everywhere and I can't find a higher handle or nicer wheels on an umbrella stoller anywhere. The only thing lacking is a big cushy seat.When I saw Inglesina come out with the Espresso I had to have it! It's perfect for long walks around the neighborhood and trips to the zoo etc. Big padded cushy seat, easy to fold (it stands up when folded so no scuffmarks), tall handles (the Espresso's are adjustible), easy to manuver with big wheels (unlike the Maclaren) that don't get twisted and cockeyed, cozy leg warmer and raincover. All that and it's small enough to fit through the clothing racks at the mall, half the size of those evenflos and gracos, and cheaper as well as better made than the Maclarens. Here's another hint: I saved seventy-five dollars on Ebay! It doesn't get more perfect than this!!"
4,ONE OF HER BEST,"""POSH"" Is one of PATRICE RUSHEN'S best releases. After she had crossed over from jazz to straight up r&b(This was her third such release) her albums got better and she became a more consistent and confident vocalist. By the way, she was one of the few women at this time writing and producing her own material!Starting the cd off right is the jammin' ""Never gonna give you up"". A straight up r&b affair that gets the toes tappin'!! She then takes a lighter approach with the adult contemporary ""Dont blame me"".The clear standouts however, are the mesmorizing ""Look up!""(Think EARTH, WIND, & FIRE or THE EMOTIONS), the simmering disco waltz ""The funk won't let you down"" and the inspiring gospel like ballad ""This is all i really know"". This cd deserved alot more credit and is clearly one of her best and one of the best r&b cds released in '79. R&B Music lives on with this album. Rock on PATRICE!"
3,Error in Song Listing,"The listing shows the first song as ""Right Now I Love You (And I'm Glad That I Said It)"". This is actually the first two selections. The first is ""Right Now"" and the second is ""I Love You (And I'm Glad That I Said It)"". Anyhow, I have not played this record for some time but I do remember that the second selection, ""I Love You (And I'm Glad That I Said It)"" is by far the best selection on the album. It should have been a hit in it's own right. Also the selection ""You and I"" was re-recorded on the Monkees' 1996 30th Anniversary album ""Justus"". It was rearranged with an additional verse, and was better on ""Justus"". Still I felt it was a pretty decent album all things considered."
4,A Cage of Eagles,"I chose this book because I am a huge fan of Ken Follett. The book surprised me when it turned out to have an underlying element of comedy and I wasn't sure if I really wanted to read it. Nonetheless, I got very involved with the antics of the prisoners and found it a very enjoyable read."
4,Suspenceful and Intriguing,"All 3 books in this trilogy are very good reading, I believe this is the first one in the series."
5,A Must Book in Everyone's Personal Library,"I stumbled on to this book at the Library and started reading it. Before I finished this book I went on line and ordered a copies for myself and my friends.I have read many books that could be summed up in a paragraph. In this book, every paragraph is a book in itself full of reflection and wonderful thought.Ton's of information to go back through at least a second time if not more to write down and remind yourself daily of the important things in life.Dr. Walsh made me feel good in my own skin and I felt like he was talking to me.He really hit's the nail on the head about Attachments and False Goals of Happiness. It is really clear how Western Society is full of meanless and soul-less existence. We tend to look down on 3rd world nations as being behind in the times but Dr. Walsh shows how they have had some of the answers to happiness all along.I will keep this book with me forever."
5,Changed My Life,"After reading this book I changed many of my personal spiritual practices and have enrichened my life. I bought five additional copies of this book to share with fellow seekers. Dr. Walsh writes in a simple, straightforward manner that ""eschews obfuscation"". The exercises are easy to follow and have been helpful for my growth. I feel the book speaks to people of any religious background and is understandable to anyone from high school and above."
4,Living through Spirituality,"I belong to a discussion group through my church and this book has been chosen for review. I came in a bit late so receiving this ""used"" book promptly was a blessing in itself. The suggestions, stories and examples provided bring a lot of thought into our discussions and our minister finds even deeper meaning to help us understand the books content. It's highly recommended to those who look for ways of changing attitude and emotions."
5,Widens your horizons,"Excellent resource for an overview of world religions. Written in an engaging way. Easy to read, but the concepts are deep. Definately a book to have on the shelf to reach for time and time again. The overall concept is inspirational."
3,"impressive, but...","i thought this book had all of the criteria of a winner but the one thing that kept nagging me the whole time was 'why not more interaction between the characters in dialogue?'.Still, that is my only problemFind this book"
1,Does not address actual uses for essential oils,"The book concentrates mainly on the chemical breakdown of various common essential oils, and does not go into any kind of depth on the use of oils. It does not address the title: Healing with Essential Oils. I found it useless and returned it. The Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy is a much better text. Also consult Valnet's books for better information."
2,Stick to the subject!!!,"The majority of this book does not focus on aromatherapy. Some history is discussed, and other than that, most of the book is spent discussing the problems with the current medical paradigm. I completely agree with him, however, I purchased a book titled ""Medical Aromatherapy"" not ""The Current Medical Paradigm Sucks."" Discussion of the essential oils does not begin until Chapter 12. Hello!! There are only 13 chapters in the book. The last two chapters of the book were great, but I really don't recommend this book."
5,One of my favorite aromatherapy books,This book packs a lot of interesting information within its covers. I am studying for my registered aromatherapist exam and this book is on the recommended reading list. I enjoyed reading the book and have highlighted numerous passages. Easy to understand and a good reference.
4,Information from an expert.,I had the pleasure of meeting the author and reading this book. He is so knowledgeable in his essential oils and their workings along with having great integrity. Another must have book in my reference library.
2,Medical Aromatherapy: Healing with Essential Oils,"This book, while loaded with plenty of technical info, LACKS plain, straightforward healing.A FEW HOURS searching ON-LINE WILL GET YOU THE SAME MEDICAL INFO, WITHOUT WEEDING THRU HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF SCIENTIFIC JARGIN!Also purchased the oils they are connected with - my experience was the WORST! My adult business experience spans decades and i can say i will never do business with them EVER. They charge the most of any company for oil - there goes the theory ""you get what you pay for""."
5,real life stories,This movie touched my heart. It was a movie about a woman who gets tortured by her own abusive husband because he don't want to face the break up.What this movie tells us is probably happening everyday to lots of women. Most of the time they don't even get help from anybody and they are alone with this problem.For me its a real life movie and not some made up Hollywood story.Victoria Principal plays this abducted woman very real.
3,Good movie,This was good about a ex-husband who want'shis ex-wife back and goes to the extreme toget her back a true story it will entertain you!
4,Reference,One of the best resources around. This is a technical work: not light reading. It is a good reference work and provides a great amount of detail including graphs and formulae. It is a shame that the calculator wheel is not included in this edition.
1,"at $78, buy an original","This publication by ""Knowledge Publications Corporation"" is (from the front matter): ""Digitally remastered and corrected for maximum quality. This version of the book is a derivative work by Knowledge Publications Corporation of the original Glasstone and Dolan authored book. It has been remastered and reformatted for modern day duplications methods and systems. Photos have been enhanced for maximum quality and the text has been sharpened and formatted.""If this makes sense to you, order from these folks. If not, buy an original copy second-hand."
1,Awful,"This is totally unexpected. this time product is horrible , looks like old items...smell horrible. Dont buy this item ever."
1,These didn't work for me.,"They didn't work for me and taking them twice a day was getting troublesome. I noticed a decrease in energy, sex drive, and overall mood, but that could've been because it was during the time when I realized I was losing hair."
4,seems effective,"i've taken these for several months now and they seem to be doing s just job, they if nothing else make my hair healthier"
3,Not sure...,"It has been about a month of use for me. I don't notice any difference in hair and 1 bottle with 90 capsules is a 1 month supply, not 3. You take 3 pills daily. I ran out of my first bottle, I do not know if I should buy another but it's not horribly expensive and pills are a lot better to use than some crap you have to spread on your scalp.Side-effects: These pills dry you out. Your mouth gets real dry and drinking lots of water doesn't seem to help. It's also gives your urine an intense yellow color. You can find that entertaining too. Also your fingernails grow faster.I'll give an update if I re-order and see what month 2 brings."
3,30 pills is not one month supply,"I only ordered this to hold me off until my finasteride gets here. I haven't seen results yet nor am I expecting to. (Mainly because I don't care if it does or not and also because it is all herbal.)My main complaint is that one bottle (30 pills) is not one month supply. This is false advertising. Taken as directed it will only last 10 days! One in the morning and two at bedtime.Also the other reviewers are right. Saw Palmetto is not proven to reduce hair loss. We do know that all man made medicine for BPH reduces hair loss. Saw Palmetto can also be used to treat BPH. So it is intuitive that it probably would work for reducing hair loss as well. Also taking vitamins does not really do anything for hair growth if the DHT is killing your hair cells, BUT if they were going to put zinc in there they should have put folic acid in there as well.Also I'm not sure what the other herbs are there for or if they are even used for hair loss."
2,Not Satisfied,Its been more than a month and have finished one bottle of procerin tablets but dint see any improvement in my hair fall. Better to try a different product.
1,It came on time but the tablets were old and very toxic smelling and give me bad reactions in a body and head after taking them,It came on time but the tablets were old and very toxic smelling and give me bad reactions in my body and head after taking them quite a few days (almost 2weeks actually)
4,is worth reading,"Having read the Vulcan Soul series, this was a worthwhile read.Spock fans will not be disappointed.Exodus: Vulcan's Soul Trilogy, Book 1 (Star Trek)Vulcan's Soul Trilogy Book Two: Exiles (Star Trek)Vulcan's Soul Trilogy Book Three Epiphany (Star Trek: the Original Series)"
3,Mr. & Mrs. Spock? I don't know...,"If anyone measures up to being the ""pointy-eared Vulcan's"" better half, it would be his strong despite her racial identity crisis protegee Saavik. Somebody like her would make the perfect partner for his first attempts at re-unifying the Romulan and Vulcan people. But I've always seen Mr. Spock as the ""lone wolf"" type, even during Nurse (later Doctor) Chapel's semirequited crush on him (semirequited because he was fond of her--just not in the way she wanted). In this story, though, the couple are hampered by biology, so the real heroes of this story are a moderate Romulan bureaucrat and his like-minded subordinates. After all, if a revolution is ever to succeed, it has to be done by ""home folks""--foreign assistance is just that: assistance. We also get to see the Stargazer-era Picard in action, as well as a Romulan's eye view of the attack on the Klingon science outpost that nobody in this story knows orphaned a little tyke named Worf."
3,Good read for TOS fans,"The book did a good job of exploring the Romulan culture and not contradicting ""Yesterday's Enterprise."" It would have been nice to have more of the book set on the Enterprise-C and what happened during the battle from Tasha's perspective, but it is a TOS book. Also making a small appearance in this book is Mike Friedman's Stargazer crew from Reunion and First Virtue. TNG/DS9/Voyager fans should skip the book if they aren't into Vulcans and TOS."
2,Basic Plot Flaw,As a couple of other reviewers have noted Spock and Saavik were introduced as teacher and student. She was his ward. The Pandora Principle did a beautiful job of telling that story. If you are going to change the nature of their relationship that dramatically you better do some darn good writing that explains how it happened. There was not one word in that book that explained this major role reversal. Quite frankly I felt the authors were demonstrating that they either didn't have the ability or didn't have the guts to tackle that very difficult and touchy issue. How and why does someone go from being a persons surrogate father to husband? Very disappointing book on many levels but this was the most egregious as far as I was concerned.
3,But Spock was a father figure to Saavik!,"Vulcan's Heart is fun to read, but I just couldn't except the basic premise of Saavik and Spock together. The fans have already explored this relationship in The Pandora Principle (Pocket Books 1990). Spock was her surrogate father, her mentor, but not her future mate! A fatal flaw-write the same book, introduce a suitable love interest for Spock, and you'd have had a good Star Trek novel."
5,Vulcan and Spock Afficiendos Will Delight,"For all Star Trek and/or Spock and/or Vulcan enthusiasts this book is a must read. Provides delightful new detail on the planet Vulcan and it's traditions, including the ever-intriguing pon farr. Great Sarek info. And if this isn't enough, the story is great. In the Star Trek genre I give it 5 stars (this isn't classical lit but what fun). Kudos to Sherman and Shwartz who also wrote Vulcan's Forge. More, more . . ."
2,Flowery Trek Book,I'm very picky over my trek books. This one was a little on the poetish flowery side which I wasn't expecting at all. I don't think I'll read another by the same author combination.
1,Don't bother,This is as bad if not worse than their first book. I was hoping for something better but was sorely disappointed.
4,One of the best of TOS novels,"dear goddess, this is so good. Sherman and Shwartz capture not only the characters, but the political intrigue and complicated choices that make for the very best of Star Trek. For those of us who have adored Spock for decades, this is extremely satisfying and genuinely well done. Bravae!"
2,who was your fact checker?,"I was disappointed overall with the transportation information, especially when the book gave incorrect directions to the Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market. Above all, a guidebook should be accurate. This book definitely isn't."
3,NIce book but old publication,I was looking for some help in our travels this summer and this book is helpful. It is just a little out of date as it was published several years ago.
2,Beautiful bottle but not very functional - the cap breaks off.,"I got two bottle for christmas and the honey is delicious but the cap breaks off because the honey gets sticky and the cap sticks then it's very hard to twist off. When I twisted it off, it broke. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Sumerian Daemons is Excellent!,"The composition and dynamics of the album are consistent. I enjoy the album immensely, even more so than Communion, if only for the length of the album. The atmosphere created by both albums is significant and the music is rife with chunk, double-kicks, and solid vocal distortions, but the simple fact is that Sumerian Daemons has more of it. Do want."
2,This album was not worth the dig to find it,So this album was supposed to be sooo good and it was nearly impossible to find. After searching for it for 6 months I finally got my hands on it and was severly disappointed. This album was not good!
3,Red/black Lace Cape with Wings,"This cape is very pretty, great idea for use as a fairy or vampire, or other gothic look. The wings are NOT attached at stated, you have to put them on the cape, I haven't tried it yet so no idea if they really do stay on. They appear to be on a bent plastic rod that you insert into a slot on the cape, what keeps them in place? No idea.My only issue with this item is that it runs small. I purchased it for me since it said it was adult sized but it is made very small in the vest and I nearly got stuck in it and it didn't close at all as shown on the model. I love the lace and the design of this cape, but it's not made for an average or larger size woman. This may my fit my 9 yr old much better. If you are super thin or have narrow shoulders it should work for you.I'm disappointed that it doesn't fit me at all, but I'll save it for future use by my daughters since it is a very pretty cape."
1,Terrible service,"I ordered 12 pairs in barely black - I received 2 pairs in beige. Now 2 months later and many calls to Amazon, the problem has not been resolved. Really terrible service."
4,Not Bad,"If u really wanna get a good boom from it, put it in a good box. Thats all....U shouldn't be dissappointed"
4,Dark Star Delight,"This is pretty much your standard Dead show fare with one exception: ""Dark Star"". Shortly into Dark Star, Jerry cracks open the void and leads his brethern through some of their most intuitive playing ever. It's all there: the Dead play with passion, color, texture and clarity. It is 23 minutes in a transcendent reality where the listener and the music are the same thing. It is too bad it is the opening cut on the album because the rest of this excellent show pales in comparison to the first 23 minutes of the best Dead zone ever."
5,My Favourite,"Well, I suppose that everyone has to have a favourite, and this is mine. The CD kicks off with one of the most melodic and interesting Dark Stars (with a little George Benson or Hugh Masekela thrown into the middle), and then it just keeps going. Going Down the Road (GDTRFB as they say) is also wonderful. If I was going to introduce anyone to the live sound of the dead, this would be the disk I'd share. Love the thing from start to finish, and don't we all just wish this music was still being created by these boys."
3,"Average ""Pick"" in comparion to others","Dick's Picks Volume 2 is the only single CD of the series, and then only 58 min. at that. But the length (or lack thereof) is not the main issue that I have. The biggest problem with this CD is that the sound of the album is flat, period. Maybe it is accentuated by the absence of Mickey Hart, who had temporarily departed the Dead at this time (Oct. 71). But even with that, I find ""Dark Star"" to be lacking in comparison to some other live versions. Things kick up in the second part of the album, starting with ""Not Fade Away"". But overall, this is a lesser addition in the overall Dead catalgue of the ""Picks"", regretfully."
5,An enchanting book for young people-especially fairy lovers.,"My mother read me this book as a child, and I loved it. It involves lots of fairies and magical places. It is about a human who finds himself amongst a clan of fairies in the forest, and befriends them. It is one of those books that once you read it, you will want to read it again, or share it with a friend."
5,LAST BORN OF ELVINWOOD By Linda Haldeman,"This has to be the best book regarding fairies and elves, it is simple and easy to read .Linda Haldeman is very discriptive when needs to be and she also captures the essence of British life.The tale has a magical feel that will surprize readers.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU LOVE BOOKS ABOUT MAGIC, ELVES AND FAIRY FOLK .Even if you dont give it a try because its a great read."
5,Very durable and easy to use,I have been using this calculator for more than a year now and it still works like new. The poor thing has been dropped by me and my kids a few times but I have to say it is very durable. I will recommend it.
5,Just what I was looking for!,"The school asked for all 6th grade to purchase this calculator. I could only find it online - it was not in any of our local office supply, Target, etc. type of stores.It works and my 6th grader loves it!"
5,What a find!,Discovery of this artist has been extremely rewarding. The amazing versatility of Helmut and his styles are amazing.Superb listening. I find myself listening to this CD over and over.Buy it. You WILL love it.
2,Low setting puts out too much heat,"I previously owned a Soleus Air Flat Panel Reflective Heater MS-11 and really loved it. This one just put out way too much heat. On the plus side, I like the timer."
4,"Good, but too bright!","I bought this to replace a Presto Heat Dish that broke. Overall I'm happy with it. It heats well and I like that it oscillates like a fan (in fact it basically looks like a fan with a heater core). It's also nice that the low setting uses half of the energy as the Heat Dish. My only complaint and warning is that this thing is BRIGHT! On the high setting, you literally cannot look at it--it's like looking directly into the sun. You either have to squint or wear sunglasses. The Heat Dish was like having fire place lighting but this is like having a blinding spot light shone in your face."
1,Doesn't heat very well,This heater is just a waste of electricity. In order for you to get warm you have to put it right next to you and then make sure you are wearing some sun glasses cause it so damn bright. I am really disappointed with this unit. Its really hard to heat a 10' x 9' room. There is no point for the oscillating cause also does nothing for you..
2,Too bright,"As others have stated, this item does heat a room. The downside is it is a killer on the eyes as it is way too bright. I am trying to find out if this horribly bright light is harmful to the eyes. It is so bright that it literally hurts my eyes, my child's eyes, and my husband's eyes."
1,"If you like a spot light in your face, you will like this product.","I bought this because of the solid reviews. This is one of the few products I have purchased and found the positive reviews to be lacking a critical detail, the brightness of this heater. I thought this would be similar to what they sell at Custco, it's not. It's ten times brighter. It is so bright its like placing a spot light in your room. If you buy it, be prepared to buy a spot light.I will likely return mine"
2,Almost lasted through the winter,"I bought one at the beginning of November for heating up my office at home. It does heat up where it's pointed at and delivers instant warmth. That's the main purpose for this heater -- keep me warm before the central AC warms up the room. I used it for about half an hour per day. The oscillation is noisy and un-stable, but that's all right. However, today (Feb.20) it finally reached its end of life. Suddenly the low heat option is gone (gives high heat output), and smoke started to come out after 5 minutes. I am glad I only used it in office instead of bedrooms while sleeping! Only use oil-filed or ceramic radiators in your bedrooms!!!"
1,Won't stay on for longer than 2 minutes,"Maybe mine is broken, but it won't stay on for longer than a couple of minutes. It'll turn on, but soon as it starts to heat up, click! It turns off, and no amount of fiddling with the on/off dial and timer will make it come back on. If you unplug it, let it go completely cold, and try again, it might start up again ... only to shut off 2-3 minutes later.Tried repositioning it, moving it to a different surface, setting it on high, setting it on low, turning on the rotation, setting the timer on/off. Nothing made it work. My laptop is a better heater than this thing."
1,Died 1 day after warranty expired,"I turned this thing on and it immediately glowed orange and started putting out heat. It makes a very quiet humm. It rotates side to side and makes not a sound from the rotation (you can turn the rotation off). The warmth reminds me of a glowing fireplace. It has a low energy draw. Works on a timer up to 90 minutes so I don't have to worry about forgetting to turn it off. I am going to order another one! FINALLY! Something that works as it should. Get one!Addendum: It crapped out one day after warranty expired. Worked great until it died. I guess if you don't mind repurchasing everything each year, this product is for you. I guess those engineers that design this crap to quit just after the warranty really earned their money on this item. Apparently they think that I will go out and purchase the same item again. I won't! I will purchase nothing with that brand name."
5,Great Heater,I love this heater. It is like having your own person sunshine. Seriously it feels like you are in the sun. It is pretty bright. That is my wife's biggest complaint with it. On low it is about like having a 40W light bulb on and on high at least a 60W bulb on. It does not look that bright in the picture but it is. I still love it though.
4,Good...minor complaint,"I got two of these heaters for a large 2 bedroom apartment. They're great for the most part...heat up a smaller room like a charm. The only complaint I have is that at night, they're really bright! They're not something you'd like to have in your living room while trying to watch a movie in the dark. They're so bright at night--looking straight into them in the dark can blind a person. But as far as the heat goes...two thumbs up!!"
2,Not reliable,I may have received a lemon but the heater stays on for a unreliable amount of time and it seems the safety thermostat kicks in and it shuts off. The inside of our house is around 55 degrees and we wished to use this for localized heating which when it is on works great.One shortcoming when it is on is it is so bright compared to other radiant heaters that if your trying to read or work in the vicinity it can be blinding and should be considered for what you are going to use it.I'm afraid we are going to return this to Amazon.What does work great and reliably is the Presto Parabolic Heater which we will be buying another of soon.Presto HeatDish Parabolic Heater Plus Footlight
3,Great if you want the sun in your room,"This is a good heater, quiet, heats fast, spreads it around tiltable, I really like it, except it is so bright I mean REALLY REALLY BRIGHT, I had to return it, beause you can't look towards it if it is on high. It hurts your eyes and leaves light spots on your eyes. Or if you want to use it at night you might want to wear blindfolds."
4,"Great for a single room use, but awfully bright.","This heater was purchased primarily to heat an office. It does the job very well, even at the low setting. It is, however, very bright and I do not recommend it for a bedroom, unless you aren't sensitive to light while you sleep. Other than that, the price is fine for what it does."
4,heater,"the heater is great for a smaller room, and especially if you're right by it. The room I have it in has tile, and is very cold, so no real way to retain the heat w/out something blowing heat out. It is very bright, which doesn't bother me, again it's not in a bedroom, but I have gotten jokes about where are the sunglasses..... Good heater,I just needed something more for the area I have it in."
1,Beware of Amazon.com,"Until recently I've noticed something very interesting about the Amazon.com's review system. It seems that about 50% of the time when I give a 1-star review on a product it will not get posted! It actually makes sense if you think about it because Amazon.com is trying to sell as much products as possible thus having a lot of negative reviews would certainly hurt the sales.I've previously written an in-depth review on this heater and it was never posted by Amazon. Since I don't want to repeat those again, let me just briefly tell you that you won't feel anything if you're more than 3.5 feet away from the front of the heater or if part of your furniture (i.e. arm rest or seat back) is blocking where this heater is pointing. Furthermore if you let it point towards your face at 800W, you'll need a good pair of sunglasses because it's too bright at a close distance (at 3.5 feet).Hopefully this review will get posted..."
3,Heater is ok,I probably would not buy this heater again because the light is just too bright. It does however work really well when getting out of the shower because it does not blow any air. It's nice and warm and the light doesn't bother me then.
5,Awesome space heater,"If you are looking for a space heater to heat up your room, this is not your product. This is not a ""room heater"" it is a ""space heater."" It will sufficiently heat up a SPACE in your room. I use it under my desk (only when I am sitting at my desk, of course) and I only need to use the 400Watt setting. It gets too hot even, sometimes. A great energy saver compared to those 1500Watt systems that don't even heat as well. I don't use a house heater and live in the cold city of San Francisco. ""The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco."" --Not Mark Twain."
1,Poor Product,The light from the heater made it impossible during the evening and night. It lit up the entire room and gave off very little heat beyond about 3 ft. It is a very disappointing product.
2,Too Bright - Unusable!,"On high, this heater emits super-bright yellow light, not the tepid orange light pictured on its box. It's so bright that you can't aim it at yourself, which defeats the purpose of its direct heat! Even on the low setting, the light is too bright for my eyes. It does generate lots of heat, but it's so bright that you have to keep behind it you. Additionally, I can't adjust the angle downward as much as I'd like, which means the dish is aimed more at my face than my body; the tip-over switch prevents me from propping up the rear, too. Returned immediately."
5,Excellent Parabolic Heater!,I love this heater as my 1st 2 were WindChaser.. Those both stopped working shortly after 1 yr. time frame. This one is very quiet and does a super job! Only complaint.. Screws are too tight to unscrew screen and clean out dust. Need a strong air blower to blow it out..
2,I am disappointed.,I bought this unit 2 years ago. I really fell in love with it. Unfortunately after the first year the high setting began to overheat and would shut down for periods of time before restarting. This year it had become so annoying with the shutting down I only would use the low setting. The last few days I smell a burning smell when I use this appliance. I guess I will try something different now. It says in the information section it does not attract dust. Well let me tell you it does and it is not any easy clean.
3,This was just okay,"This heater worked for only one winter season then burnt out. It was great when it was working, but it didn't last long."
1,Make no mistake--it's TOO BRIGHT!,"I thought it couldn't be any brighter than my old Sunbeam but I was wrong. If the heater is facing you, as it's supposed to, you're getting blasted by a big, bright light. I can't imagine trying to sleep with one of these things in the room. Sent it back."
4,Works well,"I bought this item to provide efficient space heating. I use it in short bursts to keep me warm, and it does that job well. The heat feels like standing in front of a fireplace. It doesn't seem to heat the entire room, but maybe if you ran it longer it would. I like it."
2,Its a light then a heater!,"I've always wanted one of these since seeing one at my local wholesale warehouse club. I love the amount of heat it gives off. This is similar in design and priced significantly cheaper (sale on Amazon) than the one at the club so I ordered this from Amazon. Five minutes after trying it out, it went back in the box. I wanted to get this to use while laying on my sofa in front of the TV. The amount of light this thing gives off is way too distracting unless you don't mind a blaring light in your face. The low setting is annoying, the high is just way too bright for me. I never noticed the obnoxious brightness on the one at the warehouse club. I love Amazon's return policy!"
1,Soleus Air MS-09 Heater,"I was so disappointed by the performance of this heater that I returned it. When set on ""low"" it hardly gave off any heat and when on ""high"" setting, the light is so bright and glaring but still would hardly heat up a small room. You have to sit right next to it to warm you up. A ceramic space heater is a lot more efficient than this type of heater. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,nice - while it worked.,"Had this heater for less than three months. It did the job, but it broke way too quickly. I wish the product was more durable and the light was not as bright."
2,Too darn bright,"I needed a heater to use in my basement while watching TV. This heater is way too bright for this. It's like trying to watch TV with the sun blasting in your eyes. It's nice and warm, quiet, etc. if you don't mind the light. Maybe good for seasonal affective disorder...?"
2,Heats up the room fast but dies after 2 years of regular use,"I've purchased three Soleus Air MS-09 over an 8-yr spans since I've always like how it heats up the room fast. This product, however, does not last long. All 3 of the Soleus Air I've purchased have gone bad. It just stopped working after 2-3 winters. I saw an alternate product at Costco that seems to mimic the same technology but has a better warranty. I might give that a try."
4,Quite pleased!,Purchased this heater after reading the reviews on Amazon and I'm very happy wth the results. The heater is so quiet. I love the bright glow of the heating element - it's like basking in the sun. So far I've only had to use it on the low setting and that is more than enough warmth. A great deal!
4,very warm but not good quality,"i was very surprised that such a small product could produce so much heat! the only thing i have to ""complain"" about is the quality. I picked it up once by the handle and it fell. The heater still works, but unfortunately it doesn't swing anymore. i think they should make the handle a little larger or make the base more sturdy!UPDATE: it hasn't been two weeks and the heater won't turn on. I also tried calling the 1800 number and there was no operator available. I also looked at the manual and it didn't have any good troubleshooting. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Poor reliability,"I found the product does what it is designed to do ie provide heat that is direct and focused to keep one warm. The problem is reliability. I've owned 2 units. Each lasted about 13 months, one month over the warranty. Neither were mistreated in any way. When I contacted Soleus customer service about whether they've had quality control issues, they couldn't have cared less."
3,"Good heat, but a little too bright.","Produces nice, quiet heat, but the unit is really, really bright. I originally bought this for my home, but it was too bright. It works well in my office, which is about 15' x 15'. Overall, a fairly decent product if you don't mind the extra light it puts out."
2,ONLY LASTED 1 YEAR!!,THIS THING WORKED GREAT WHEN IT WORKED. WE USED IT HALF LAST WINTER AND HALF THIS WINTER AND THE BULB BURNT OUT!!!!! I TOOK THE THING APART AND THE BULB DOES NOT LOOK REPLACEABLE. WHY DON'T HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES LAST LONG ANYMORE? IT ALL CRAP! 1 YEAR OF USE FOR 60 DOLLARS HARDLY SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DEAL!!
2,Not what I expected.,I was under the impression that this book would describe in detail the different areas of Psychology and which schools would be the best for that area of study. I was thoroughly disappointed to see that it was just a long listing of every school in the nation and canada that only described things such as class sizes and tuition. They did list the areas of study available but I was hoping that it would go into detail about the different areas of study. It did not say anything about how to figure out which area is best for which careers. It was also difficult to navigate the textbook. I plan on selling it on Amazon. I was also disappointed by the fact that I bought it new but it was obviously a used textbook by the crinkled front cover and writing on the inside.
4,Good for what it is...,"This book contains good information, but the overall scope of the information is rather limited. I ended up purchasing another book for more details."
4,great guide,"Let's be realistic about what this book is meant to do. First, it will not tell you anything about how to get into grad school (for example, what classes to take, if research is important for your program, etc.). Second, it will not list what researchers are present in which schools. What this book will do is be a starting point in the search for the schools you want to apply. I used to book to form a list of schools for which I wanted to do more research on. I went through the book (the states in which I wouldn't mind living) and made a list of programs that I would be interested in. The book helped me realize right away that I had no chance of getting into certain programs because of my GRE scores or that a school requires the Subject Test. It was a great starting guide and it helped me get organized in my search for schools."
3,"It's Yellow Cake Mix, what do you expect? It's ok.","Frankly, I expected more. They sure make it sound good. But it's just a yellow cake mix, after all. If you love yellow cake mix, I'm sure you'll like it just fine. I say, ""blah, boring."""
1,No beauty in this book!,"If you want to study photography and the history of the nude male in photography, then you should buy this book! In that regard it is a great book. However, I bought the book because I wanted to look at beautiful naked males.If you also want to look at beautiful nude males, then this book has little to offer. Few models in the book are what I would call beautiful and few models are young.It really depends on what you are looking for."
3,Average Brazilian pop,"Afropop-reggae ""axe"" music (pronounced ""ah-shay"") with a strong carribean-soca influence. Also, like so much of modern Brazilian pop, a too-strong hangover from the '80s -- too slick, too predictable and too goofy, though certainly better than many similar albums."
1,Migraine relief?,I bought this on the recomendation of my neurologist.I've been taking it for 2 months along with B2 and Magnesium.I'm actually having more migraines every month since I started taking these supplements.They have not been helpful for me.
5,"Finally, a book just for Space Planners!","This book starts with a criteria table and walks you through a project from beginning to end, creating spaces, space styles, analyzing adjacencies, creating areas, area reports. Using Space Boundaries and then converting them to walls. Developing the floor plan, creating the reflected ceiling plan, and furnishing the spaces, ending with 2D and 3D elevations.Along the way, you learn how to manage displays, create custom tags and schedules, set up your system to do just space planning work, create layouts and documentation.Many of the tools in this book aren't discussed anywhere else - not even in Autodesk's Knowledge Base. The perfect book to help you understand how to use ADT for space planning, great for the classroom or the office. (No tests in this book - just lots of step by step tutorials with plenty of screen shots.) No prior knowledge of ADT is assumed. Experience with AutoCAD is preferred."
1,Can I have my money back?,"The authors often jump to conclusions about Gods point of view without giving the Bible verses to back up their statements. On page 197, the authors write that ""God weeps"" and ""God is saddened when we veil ourselves..."" What Bible verses state this? On page 249, a woman on a trip to the Dominican Republic with an aid organization wonders whether she would have time to keep up her nails. She prayed to God and SENSED God telling her that nail polish had done its work in her, so she let the nail polish go. I could go on and on with examples of this type of shallow nonsense. Sorry to the authors, I don't like to be critical, but could not find any reason to recommend the book."
4,I really like this book...,"Used it for an experimental psychology course and it really explains things well. I am not a fast learner (most of the time), but this book can explain anything from ""main effects and interactions"" to ""the sleeper effect"" to ""social loafing"" very effectively. There are chapter summaries (that are very nice) and glossary and definition sections. Finally, the hardcover is LOVELY, the book stays in excellent condition. Not a bad college book at all."
4,"Tattered, but entirely useable","It was aged more than i expected, but this in no way effected its' legibility. A fine job, I suppose."
5,Research Methods in Psychology,"I used this textbook for a higher level Psychology course. Had lots of great information, and it proved to be helpful."
4,Dry reading not in the least.,"I found that the initial writings of St. Therese were getting very dry in reading, but something within the writings kept me reading on. What I realize now is how deeply spiritual some of St. Therese of Lisieux writings are, but you have to search within to feel the meaning.When St. Therese realized that she had TB she gave thanks to God that herJourney on earth will be short. Not to fear death but to embrace it as a gift, for she had the spiritual awareness that most of us are limited in understanding. The spiritual awareness was from within and not from someone preaching about salvation to her. The true sign of a spiritually gifted person, unselfish and free of the ego of personality."
2,Disappointing...,"I have struggled to get along with my boyfriend's parents for the past year and, having read the positive reviews on the cover, had strong hopes that this book would offer some insight into how I could make things better with them.I think that calling this book a ""how-to"" guide is misleading. This is mainly a collection of anecdotes from a variety of ""in-laws"". About 70% of these stories are about positive in-law relationships. The author merely strings these stories together and at the end of each chapter offers a small paragraph or two of vaguely-defined, common-sense suggestions.If you are looking for some real life stories that you can relate to, you may enjoy this book. But if you are having real difficulties with your in-laws or prospective in-laws, this book offers little solid advice or insight."
3,"Fiction, how wonderful it would be to live there.",If only Samantha was able to legally carry her sidearm that night she left the library late-maybe she wouldn't have been raped.But that doesn't sell novels now does it.
5,Feel No Evil,"As I began reading the first chapter, I was rapt! I couldn't put the book down. I needed to know what was going to happen next. Author, Rosemarie Aqualina's writing style envokes the reader to pull in every word and become a character within the cast. I encourage you to read it; you will not be disappointed!"
1,Oh Please!,This novel is something that you'd read that was written by a college student taking creative writing. Highly improbably scenarios thickly laced with cliche made me cringe with embarassement for the writer. To think that this made it to print! I counted two typos in the first two chapters and inconsistency with the character development--in Chapter 1 Skyler is described as being 32 years old. A few chapters later when only a week or so has passed in the storyline--he's aged to 35! What the heck? Don't waste your money. Well unless you like to read a good trainwreck!
5,Amazing and Brilliant!!,"""Feel No Evil"" is one of those life changing books. It captures the reader from the very first sentence and does not let the reader go until the end, but the reader is still left wanting more. Judge Aquilina is an amazing writer, professor, Judge, and person. Her book has been an inspiration to me especially as a law student. I have recommended this book to everyone I encounter and they all have loved it. It is brilliantly written! It is a masterpiece of literature and I can't wait for a second book by Judge Aquilina. She is now one of my top 5 favorite fiction writers. Anyone who reads this book will enjoy it! Anyone who reads this book won't regret it!"
4,Not From Hollywood,"A great Sci-Fi Spoof, lots of fun moments.If you like UHF, here is one you have to read (subtitles)!!!!!!"
3,I Was Held Hostage,"I was duct taped to a chair by a serial killer with a memory problem who left this running on the television in the damp fetid cellar. It wasn't bad, but then I wasn't choosy at the time. The killer came back in and toyed with me for a while and then stopped to watch the film. After gazing at it for a while a peculiar expression came over his face and he left the room. I heard a gunshot and a thud. About an hour later, a SWAT team descended on the place and freed me. By this time the film was over, so no one else was hurt. So, if you're ever duct-taped to a chair in the basement of a serial killers' house, there are worse films to be subjected to I guess."
1,"Great FX, but otherwise unwatchable","This fanmade offering, more than seven years in the making, gets the look and the effects right, but very little else. The script relies too much on knowledge of the past ""Star Wreck"" webisodes, and the humor mostly falls flat. The acting ranges from passable to amateurish. While the Finnish with English subtitles was only nominally distracting, for a comedy it might've worked best if they'd dubbed an English version. Considering Revolver is marketing this as a parody of the J.J. Abrams' ""Star Trek"" reboot, there are going to be a lot of disappointed fans out there."
1,TERRIBLE!,"The only good thing I have to say about this stairmaster is that it does seem to be mechanically sound. I originally had the 4000PT which was wonderful. I thought that a newer version would be great, however, I was really disappointed! I was shocked at how cheaply it was made with what seems to be a very low end plastic type of material. I had to take great care while assembling it because it seemed on the verge of breaking as I put it together! Anyone who has used the 4000PT knows that it is built like a tank so you can imagine my shock at the lack of quality of the 4200PT. In addition, anyone who is chemically sensitive should beware. There was a definite odor when I removed it from the box which immediately gave me a headache. This is often a problem with cheap plastics, etc. I cannot believe that I paid over $2,000 for this piece of junk!"
2,Rate Prison,I really like Stephanie Zimbalist but I just did not like the story. Her performances in Remington Steele were fabulous.
4,Stephanie Zimbalist was great in this movie,Stephanie Zimbalist had once again demostrated to her audience and herself that she is a able actress. Hollywood should pay more attention to her and give her more roles in art-house/ independent movie roles. She was really good in this movie and a delight as usual to see her on the screen.Benjamin
2,Prison of Boredom,"The movie was very boring. It was a low budget movie with a low budget of excitement. I had to watch this movie four times before I was able to watch the movie in its entirety, because each time I tried I constantly fell asleep."
1,HEAVILY CENSORED,I BOUGHT THE DVD BUT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED FOR VARIOUS REASONS.FIRST OF ALL SONDRA LOCKE IS LIKE A GHOST IN THE FILM.SHE ONLY APPEARS FOR SECONDS IN A HANDFUL OF SCENES AND ONLY MUTTERS A FEW WORDS.NOT TO MENTION THERE ISNT A HINT OF AN EROTIC SCENE-AS HIGHLITED ON THE COVER-UNLESS YOU COUNT A HUG OR TWO.PICTURE QUALITY WAS BARELY AVERAGE AND SOUND WAS JUST AWFUL.ACTING WAS ACCEPTABLE.I REALLY REGRET BUYING THE DVD.
4,Read it in the Barnes and Noble cafe,"The title says it all. If you hate the current occupant of the White House and end up getting in arguments with your friends and family about how you should be patriotic and uspport out president this book will give you some ammunition to hold up your side of the argument.I wish it had been titled differently as it is a better book than you might expect from the cover. Authoer Huberman does a credible job laying out tall the reasons why he thinks Bush doesn't belong on Pennsylvania Avenue.I guess bias seems inescapable in a book so provacatively titled but it is more readable and credible than most of Micheal Moore's hysterical rantings.In my opinion Jame Bovard lays out a better case in ""The Bush Betrayal"". If you were going to read one book that lays out the case against our fratboy president go for Bovard. If you can't get enough of the Bush bashing, this is decent followup to Bovards work even though it covers much of the same ground."
5,Every American should read this.,"Liberals will find it a useful tool for disputing rightwing dittoheads. Conservatives will find it a valuable resource for understanding the left's disgust for President Bush. People of every political stripe will find it a well documented (268 footnotes) overview of Jr.'s presidential record.Huberman writes in a concise style that neither panders nor sugar-coats the facts. He presents his material encyclopedia style, allowing the reader to look up information quickly and easily. From ""Abortion, Birth Control and Reproductive Health"" to ""Zinni, Anthony"", the wide ranging topics cover a great deal of ground.Whether you like George W. Bush or despise him, this book is a must-read for anyone who will be voting for President in November, 2004."
3,Can someone write a good review please?,"I am wondering when someone is going to write an actual review of the BOOK instead of simply whining about George Bush. I dislike him as much as the next guy, but I'm looking for a review of the BOOK, not of all the nasty things Bush has done. Come on people... I would hope there was bit more maturity than this floating around in this country.So... can anyone tell me about the book?"
1,Factual?,"Political bias and solid information are two totally different realms. The book is full of opinions, not facts, and I found myself constantly disagreeing with Huberman's reasoning. The few facts may be true, but the spin he puts on them is unprofessional and inaccurate.He doesn't give any evidence that Bush is the worst president in 100 years. If he did, he would soon find that Clinton's was far more, um, appalling and disgraceful."
1,"There are 59,459,765 reasons not to get this !","Just ask the 59,459,765 who voted for Presidnet Bush what they thought of this piece of trash !"
3,Handy Reference Work,"A morbidly fascinating examination of the Bush Administration's many outrageous atrocities to date, THE BUSH-HATER'S HANDBOOK is a worthy, quick-read reference book filled with a surplus of well researched and detailed information about our most atrocious President ever. Jack Huberman has provided quite a handy source of facts and figures for anyone caught in the middle of an argument with a deluded Bush apologist. While it is far from the best of its kind - THE BOOK ON BUSH by Eric Alterman and Mark Green and BUSHWHACKED by Molly Ivins quickly come to mind as far superior and much more enlightening works - THE BUSH-HATER'S HANDBOOK is an acceptable starting point for anyone who has only recently been able to see through the conservative-controlled media's deliberate misinformation about (and continual protection of) our infuriatingly incompetent ""leader."""
4,A brief comment,"I consider this to be a reasonable expose of the most corrupt, cronyist, and appalling presidency of the last 100 years. And to think it happened here. Oh well, what can you say--only in America. After all, is not GWB living proof that even a mediocre man can still rise to the top here with enough hard work--and support from his wealthy friends and father?"
4,Good guidebook,Good little book if you follow the music of Fleetwood Mac and are as big of a fan as I am. Easy to read and has some good photos of the band that haven't been seen before.
2,"Disappointing sequel to ""Ashes of Eden""","Disappointing best describes my feelings upon finishing this ""sequel"" to ""Ashes of Eden."" The plot--in which the Next Generation's baddest ""baddie,"" the Borg, team up with the baddest baddie still around from the original series, the Romulans--seems very unplausible given the nature of the Borg as depicted in the series and in film. Kirk also comes across as a very unreal character and many of his actions in the book are so implausible that it drags down the entire novel. I was hoping for a plot in which the Borg resurrected Captain Kirk to use him as a spokesperson for the Borg as they had used Captain Picard in ""Next Generation."" Instead I got a convoluted plot involving the Romulans that was very dissatisfying."
4,Frank opinion of 'The Return',"I read this novel. It is a story that soaks you up, tickles your curiosity to finish. It reads like 3 stories, takes you in 3 directions at once. Each one keeps you interested.Pros: It has great action, interesting mix of familier characters from Next Generation as well as some surprises from the original series.Con: Kirk sort of written 'larger than life' in 1 or 2 scenes.You keep reading, you'll know what I mean. Eventually authors try to involve too many familier chars into one novel, thus short changing and making it hard to maintain relevance of having so many.Pro: It all blends in, story comes to a finale. You'll see how some elements were used from and in a couple ST Movies. Clever use I thought."
3,a good book but hard to follow,"the return was a good book but i had the hardest time following it! this is one of those books thet you need to read more than once just to see what it means.i enjoyed seeing captain kirk alive again (after all he is a good character) but the way he was brought back was a little ""out there"" even for star trek. now don't get me wrong i find mr. shatner to be a fine writer but reincarnating himself? i think that he could have been a little more creative then that.all around i think that it was a good book but maybe in his next book (i won't spoil the ending for those of you who haven't read it yet) he should think of something else."
5,You can't put this one down!,"Details. That's what this book has. You learn so much about the Star Trek universe. You learn many previously unknown details about V'ger, the Borg and their homeworld, Romulans, and the events after Star Trek: Generations. Unlike television and movies, you hear what the charactersare thinking and feeling, especially Kirk. Shatner is obviously the best qualified to write Kirk's return. With Kirk's fate still unknown at the end, there should definitely be a sequel!"
2,"The bewigged, paunchy, cheesy ham tries to write...","Mr Shatner (a god unto himself) has deigned to generously share with us his vision of just how wonderful and attractive to women he is. Surprise surprise! He wasn't REALLY killed off in his last movie! He was obviously hoping to squeeze a few more million out of the franchise by having this homage-a-moi turned into a movie. Thank God they didn't. The book is actually well written (he had two adept co-authors) but the plot is a old, fat, bald man's dream to be the teen idol he never was. He is particularly mean in his subtly cutting attacks at his former co-stars, via their characters. Time to give up, Bill.."
4,Doubts about the author's motives,"While the story is great and the writing style is excellent, I still have the feeling that this book is more than just a novel. Sometimes, it feels like it is a novelised movie. Perhaps Shatner proposed an idea for a next movie after Generations, but Paramount turned it down. Shatner/Kirk doesn't/didn't want to die"
4,Great Book..... BUT,"Hey, this book is one of the best, but I must say that to bring Kirk back to life again (kind of) is pretty stupid. I don't think Shatner should have included the borg in his reincarnation. He could have had them come into the picture later. I think the brainwash or something like that was a great idea. Even the going after Picard was a good idea. I love Kirk, I mean my e-mail address even has his middle name in it. It was a awesome book."
2,Eh..... not great,"The book had an interesting storyline with lots of action, but I can't get used to Shatner's writing style, it seems to lack depth. Seems to be more suited to be a movie than a good book."
2,Shatner's Delusion - Kirk as Superman,"I'm not sure which is less forgivable, Shatner's distorted vision of Kirk as a super-strong, super-intelligent being or his 2-dimensional portrayal of all of the other cast members of Star Trek and The Next Generation. You would think that with the vast amount that has been filmed and written this would be the easy part.The book is well written and the ideas behind the plot are interesting and consistent with the Star Trek mythos. The authors' descent into Kirk hero-worship is inescapable on any page. This MAY have been a better book if written as a straight science fiction novel rather than a 'Star Trek' novel.I'm glad I borrowed it from the Library. I certainly got my money's worth"
4,This book is amazing!,I just love how all the Star Trek books stay connected. I believe they should make a movie out of this book. It would have so much technology involved in it. And I love when they cross over characters from the other series. I read almost all of the Next Generation books that I can get hold of.
5,It's Too Late Now,"This is the story should have been used for the movie after Generations. It is superior to First Contact on all counts.Just like Kirk is the only person capable of saving the entire universe, he was also the only person capable of saving the Star Trek franchise. It's a shame it's too late for that now. Enjoy Enterprise while it last."
1,Good for comedy value- nothing more!,"Ok.. ive been reading these rave reviews... Have I slipped into an alternative universe where this book is actually good? Ok, I think its probably quite well written, but please! The story is so so stupid!This book is just a shrine to Shatners ego. He makes Kirk into a god-like superbeing who whoops Worf's puny ass before exposing Picard as a bumbling buffoon...Oh yeah, then he defeats the borg.If your a serious Sci Fi or TNG fan, then I promise you... your jaw will drop at the sheer stupidity of this book!I love Shatner...It's hard not to! I have his Rocketman video s aved on my hard drive and I often leave Kirk impersinations on peoples answerphones...Buy this book if you want to have a laugh! If you want sci fi... leave it well alone!"
3,"Fun for Trek fans, but with a few flaws.","This is a fun read for fans of Captain Kirk. If you're not a big Kirk fan, however, you may be a bit annoyed. In this story Kirk is strong enough to beat Warf in hand to hand combat and smart enough to utilize technology he has never used. Of course, the author is probably a little more fond of Kirk than the average reader. Overall, it is a good story, but in the end, the solution to the Borg threat is far to easily reached."
4,OK NOT A CLASSIC BUT QUITE ACTION FILLED,"I usually don't write a review unless I feel 5 stars are warranted but, this book was an edge of your seat adventure that brings together the best TREK heroes and villans. This is excellent escapism and well worth the price."
5,This Book is great!,I read this and the fact that kirk was able to defeat a Worf is the fact that kirk is tougher that you think ok so its a little unreal but hey it makes a good story and the fact he knew about holograms is he did come back from the energy ribbon to learn about the this of the future so he wasnt compleatly stupid and times change with the phasers some ships carry blue phasers the ENTERPRISE D carryed reddish orange phasers different ships different phasers
1,Beyond Crap!,"I cannot believe the kind of stupid senseless drivel that the StarTrek universe has come to. I guess that they really want to ride thecash cow as much as possible. I used to read EVERY Star Trek book thatcame out. The last few years, each book has basically gotten worse andworse. This book is a badly written, hero-worshiping piece of crap. I canno longer stand it. This book should have been called Star Trek: The Return of Crap."
5,Excellent!,"Great book ! Exquisete cover , Excptional plot , Perfect time and settings . Most importantly the book was anything but a dissipontment . One minor tiny flaw , What was the deal with the Defiant-class Enterprise? It dosen't really matter but the Borg and Romulans joining forces , who would of thought of that , that's why it's brilliant!"
3,At least everything you would expect and more.,"This import collection features all of the tracks that the Animals recorded under the production of Mickie Most from 1964 to 1965. The collection is a bit of a disappointment as there is no material from 1966 featured here such as ""Don't Bring Me Down"" or ""Inside Looking Out"". All of the singles that the Animals were famous for are located here. There are a few good album tracks as well such as ""Bright Lights Big City"" and ""I'm Mad Again"". But there is quite a bit of filler on here as well in the form of stock blues attempts that just do not hold up very well. If you are an average fan of the Animals, a simple greatest-hits package will do just fine. On the other hand, this is the only place that you are going to find the Eric Burdon original ""I'm Gonna Change The World"". This great song was only issued as a B-side."
3,A good journalistic account,"McAllester has told the story of the war in Kosovo from his own perspective, as a journalist moving around the province without official sanction, and from the perspective of several Kosovars living in the city of Pec, like most of Kosovo a formerly Serbian city which is now primarily Albanian.This story is effective. The violent finale is one the reader will see coming, but it remains shocking and powerful - these are real people and not fictional characters. McAllester has done a good job in describing the nightmare for ordinary people trying to live through war and ethnic cleansing. His account of his own experiences is less gripping, but reasonably interesting.What he hasn't done is give a broader perspective. This book will tell you little about the Kosovo war, it's historical background, the breakup of Yugoslavia, or the war's outcome and significance. For those who are looking for a broader history of these events, this book is entirely inadequate."
1,Reporter who forgot he's not the story,"If you know anything about the region and recent events, this book will not enlighten you further. If you don't know anything about what went on in Kosovo, but would like to, ""A Village Destroyed,"" by Fred Abrahms is a much better source. If you want to know what it's like to be a green newspaper reporter covering his first war this might be of some interest."
5,It works for me.,"I hate trying to hike with a small digital SLR around my neck bouncing off my chest and my digital video camera in one hand as I try to keep my balance on narrow rocky trails. I have tried to carry an over the shoulder camera bag, but then it takes several minutes to unpack and get a camera out, and by then, the shot is lost. This waistpack can be worn backwards and frontwards allowing for easy hiking and quick access of either of my cameras. It is a bit big for a waistpack, but it has to be to hold my two cameras and give me the quick access I need."
4,Good camera bag.,"I don't have the luxury of being able to physically shop at many camera stores as I live on a small Island in the Pacific. As with all purchases online, I purchased this bag with apprehension only because I didn't have the tactile experience of shopping in a store. The bag is comfortable to use, and with the different options of carrying this bag, it is very versatile. I only have two minor complaints, one is the top compartment zipper is not as quick to open as other types of bags, the other being that some of the zippers when closed, do not seal shut. This bag is advertised for extreme conditions, and should not have flaws like these. Maybe it is only my bag but again I couldn't examine it before purchase. That being said, as long as there is no typhoon, it's the first bag I grab!"

4,I ENJOYED IT.,"NOW, I DO NOT KNOW IF IT WAS BECAUSE I WATCHED IT DURING A STORM, BUT I ENJOYED THIS LITTLE HORROR GEM. TRUE, THE ENDING WAS A LITTLE EUROPEAN FOR MY TASTE, BUT THAT DOES NOT DISCOUNT THE FACT THAT THIS MOVIE IS SCARY. I MEAN, SCARY. THE VIOLENCE IS SO WELL DONE YOU ALMOST FEEL THE WOUNDS. IT IS NOT THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (GREAT), BUT IS NOT THE BLAIR WITCH 2 (HORRID) EITHER. IT IS A QUIRKY LITTLE MOVIE WORTH A LOOK SEE."
2,Deep in the Woods...,"...is where this should be buried. Yeah, it had some interesting ""fresh"" ideas - tacked onto a stale recipe. Take a group of young, attractive people. Put them in an absurd situation that no one with any intelligence would walk into. Deprive them all of any remaining ounces of common sense they have. Have them disappear one by one. Distract them from figuring out who the killer is, even though we have long since done so. Shake, don't stir. Yadda yadda yadda. If you've been living under a rock for 30 years, you might find this interesting. Otherwise, skip it."
1,BEFORE YOU RENT THIS..!!!,"You need to know that this film is dubbed in English, and the voiceover artists are TERRIBLE. If you can tolerate that, then...well... it's still a terrible movie. It is impossible to get past the incredibly poor dubbing to watch this, and I watch foreign horror whenever a good one comes out. This ain't it. Save your money and rent something - anything - but this. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
1,1 star to many.,Wow was that ever awful! I'd write more but Im busy cleansing my DVD player after loading that steaming pile!!!
3,I watch a lot of French movies,"As teen-slasher movies go, I've seen a lot better, but for a French horror flick, it was a masterpiece. French horror movies usually make me shiver, but sometimes not for the reasons the director intended.The original French language version of this film is better - the English dubbing on this one sounds a lot like the actors called it in on cell phones - but if you don't speak French, I'd recommend watching the French track with subtitles. The subtitles give a pretty accurate translation of the original - and the photography and directing make suffering them much less painful.By the way, the original French version, ""Promenons-nous dans les Bois,"" takes its title and underlying theme from a popular French children's song of the same name. The song sort of helps tie the movie together, but as they say ""it was lost in the translation."""
5,Fantastic Book. You relive the season thru It!,"To preface this review, I am a die Hard Sox fan, so I am biased. But if you are as well, this book will take you thru the entire season, and allow you to relive it thru 2 other die hards eyes.They really capture the feeling of a true fan. I just reread this again, and it really brought me back.I highly recommend this book!"
4,"""Curse is over!"" review by former minor leaguer and ENG teacher turned WRITER","Stephan King continues to demonstrate his versatility as a writer. What another great notch he has etched into his legacy as one of the most important writers of our time. For another example of King stepping outside the box, check out his memoir ON WRITING."
1,WARNING:,"This book may be harmful to your 2004 Red Sox memories. Indeed, if you treasure your recollections of that glorious World Series year, you'll want to keep them untainted by this laborious and witless tome. It does nothing to enhance the memory of that magical season, and only serves to crush it under a torrent of unceasing and pointless personal detail as written by these two unrelentingly self-satisfied and self-referential would-be diarists. The whole experience is akin to being trapped on a bus or plane next to two high-fiving Sox fans who ramble on and on about the games (and even more tediously, themselves) in the most smug and annoying manner imaginable. If you really want to relive that wonderful 2004 season, just close your eyes and let your own memories unfurl. And if you feel you must check out this book, just wait a little while and pick it up at your local bookstore on the bargain or remainder table, where it is destined to be very soon."
3,People don't play for a reason,"If you can get past the authors insane love of Brian Dauback, Ellis Burks, Ceasar Crespo and other lesser players that at one time or another graced the roster of the red sox this book is ok. (they repeat over and over again that these people should be playing, even though their stats are as bad as their performances) It will be a better read in five years when I don't remember most of the games myself."
4,A must for avid sox fans,"This is a book that, oddly enough, reflected a lot of the same sentiments I had during the year. As a far-from-Fenway diehard, I was envious that these guys (King and O'Nan) were able to go to Fenway so often. My main source of sox games and info was listening on MLB.com and the internet. Still, my hopes and dreams were mirrored in this book and I think it captures the struggles and triumph true Sox fans had during 2004. The book is not meant to be a story, but a diary. It does that. Those of you diehards: read it! If you are a casual fan outside the loop of agony of the Red Sox Nation over the years, it won't mean much."
5,Faithful not just for Red Sox Fans.,"I have been a Red Sox fan as long as I can remember. Moving out of New England years back, I still follow the Sox and ecstatic was not even the word when I saw Foulke throw the ball to first to record the final out. And I got to relieve this memory and more in Faithful. What I loved about the book is not only did it follow the games, it followed the life of two other Sox fans and how it can be all-consuming to be a part of ""Red Sox Nation"" I loved that even though Stephen King is a famous author he still gets excited by his idols and wants autographs and other memorabilia just like little kids. Being a Sox fan is not easy at times and they showed the angst and anxiety that comes along with the job. But I bet if they had to do it over again, they would not change being a Sox fan for anything. And neither would I."
2,How many BP balls did Stewart O'Nan catch today?,"In what was one of the most unprecedented baseball season in the last century, the storyline for a great book was there for the taking. Unfortunately Steven King and Stewart O'Nan didn't come close to telling the tale. This book was for the most part a post game wrap-up of each nights action, an occasional email discussion between the authors , and O'Nan describing how many foul balls or BP home runs he caught (it seemed like dozens).If you're really looking for a good review of the season, I'd suggest saving your money and getting the NESN DVD (not the MLB one). Stick to the horror SK... - EH"
3,"These guys are Sox ""FANS""?","I am as big a Sox fan as there is. Not one of the many who have recently jumped on the bandwagon. Having had access to all of the Sox games on cable, many of the stories the authors told about each individual game made for some good reading for me b/c it brought back ""good memories.""The problem with this book is that the authors harp way too much on the negativity which too many people harbor over the Sox going 86 yrs without a championship. Secondly, the writing style drove me nuts. Mr. King stick to mystery novels please.Save your cash, or better yet, just go to a library to get this book. I recommend reading Dan Shaughnessy's recently published book instead."
3,Okay but I thought it could be better!,"This book was a descent book. But i thought it would be better. I thought it didnt seem to me like it really picked up. The ending was the best part, but the beginning needed some work. After reading this book I really enjoyed these authors points of view on the season. My favorite part was when they were talking about the A-Rod fight. Good stuff. Also it seemed like they were a little rushed and needed to get the book out quick because there was even a very rare gramatical error I found in the prelude(wrong kind of to) O'Nan did a good job of describing the season also. I would recommend this book to die hard Sox fans or anyone who knows baseball, because you really need to know about baseball to understand this book. I even learned some new stuff from this book. This book is okay but needed more in the beginning. But hey, this is only one guys opinion."
1,terrible book,"I am not a BoSox fan at all, I am a huge BlueJays fan but I have read many baseball books about the hated Red Sox or Yankees and enjoyed them thoroughly. This however, is the worst one I have ever read! How about a little baseball knowledge before writing a book?? Some of the things they said are absurd. Not recommended at all!"
1,Foul-Mouthed Jerks,"In real life this was a great story. In this inept retelling the co-authors come across as foul-mouthed jerks. To make matters worse, their pedestrian account is padded out by exchanges of surpassingly banal e-mails. The Red Sox deserved better, and will get it from other authors."
3,Red Sox Book Group,This book was fun to read to remind you of the things that happened during this season. It was short on insight and pretty uneven as you might expect a diary to be.What might be more interesting is having Red Sox players form a book group and discuss the highlights and faults of every Stephen King book.
2,Repetitive and dull,"This book is such a waste of a golden opportunity. It is repetitive and dull. Repetitive and dull. Repetitive and dull. O'Nan comes off like a ball-chasing goon, forever trying to snag one wherever he goes. Couldn't he write about anything else at least once? Throw in lots of cursing, and the Red Sox winning the World Series on the TV in the other room, and you get the essence of this book. Disappointing."
1,2006 only 84 more years till another title,"Very poor choice for a cover photo. Jason should have been a man and took off his mask. This is really a book for diehard redsox fans only. The avrage baseball fan will choke on it. Stephen king should stick to what he does best,, Horror. Maybe he should write about this Redsox season."
1,REPULSIVE COVER,Why the editors / authors chose such a vile photograph for the cover is mystifying.Disgraceful...
5,True fan,I was happy to learn that King was a true Sox fan! The book brought out the humanity in him to give you the feeling that he was just a regular guy praying for his team to break the 80 year curse. The book was entertaining and read somewhat like a novel - King Style. I recommend this book to not just Sox fans but to all sports fans. It's a good read. Another good read I had over the weekend was the System by Roy Valentine. I'm sure sports fans will enjoy that book as well.
1,not nearly as good as the Red Sox were in 2004,Sounds like a couple of friends exchanging e-mails during a wonderful season. I'm a die-hard Sox fan and Stephen King is a talented writer but this is certianly not one of his best efforts. Want to read the e-mail exchanges between my friends and I during last season?
3,"Great concept, but...","Collectors of 20s dancebands always rejoice when they can obtain an Okeh 78 in clean condition, particularly the electric recordings from 1927-1929. So it is somewhat disappointing that more than half the tracks in this two-disc set are either acoustically recorded, or from the first year of dreadful ""TrueTone"" electric recording.I also take issue with the pitch of the transfers of the acoustic sides, some of which sound like they were transferred at a speed other than that at which they were recorded. Perhaps these are minor quibbles; while some tracks (especially on the acoustic disc) are weaker than others, it does provide a good overview of the label's danceband roster, and if you collect music from this era you'll probably want this regardless of what any reviewer says!"
4,"It works, but be careful...","First off, I have to say, the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream has actually made an improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles in the month or so I have been using it. I don't have a lot of really deep wrinkles, but the ones near my mouth have definitely been reduced. I'm very impressed how the cream has done on the fine parchment-y wrinkles on my forehead. That part is awesome.This stuff does make your skin more sensitive. They warn on the package that the cream will sting at first, and yes, it did. Your skin gets used to the active ingredients, and it stops stinging eventually. However, my skin is a bit sensitive to touch. Maybe this will go away after a few more months. I also feel more sensitive in the sun, as they warn you. The ""gee, I better get out of the sun"" feeling comes on very quickly. Also, the eye area is a little too sensitive for this cream, so if that's your main wrinkle concern, you need to get another product for that area."
5,magic eraser,"I have been using this product to diminish little bumps under my eyes, wrinkles around my eyes, and little indentations that looked like little craters in my skin on the side of my nose,not on my nose, but the skin right next to my nose. I am so happy with the product all of these flaws have diminished by about 90% and I am expecting it to diminish even more. I highly recommend it."
4,Wrinkles,"This product has helped me some. If you have wrinkles any improvement is appreciated.RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream, 1-Ounce TubeDue to having dry spots to my face I did not use this product everyday and I still saw noticeable results in little as a few application of this product."
2,I broke out!,"I did not have good luck with this product! I broke out with zits & after two weeks of using I have stopped. I wish I would have tried it longer for better results, but the wrinkles look worse with acne!"
3,Prevents dryness..,"It prevents dryness. But I have not seen any change yet when it comes to lines or wrinkles. Well, I don't really have wrinkles yet, but just laugh lines. It's been 3 weeks and am still hoping it really reduces the line depths (if not remove)."
3,It is Ok-ish,"I was using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and decided to give ROC a try. Neutrogena has a stronger effect on my skin [which is not sensitive to Retinol at all]. With Neutrogena I saw more dramatic glow in my skin, I will switch back once I finish my ROC tube."
2,roc night cream,Purchased this product along with the other roc products in this line. as with the others this is a waste of money. Deep wrinkle removal is definitely not what you get. This doesn't even remove or improve small wrinkles or fine lines!!!
3,"Ehhh....not much so far, but feels tingly, anyway","Has a pleasant smell, absorbs easily, tingles a bit. Not much noticeable effect after a couple of weeks but you can't expect too much from these products...."
1,it burned my face and eye completely,"I got this product due to the fact that it won allure best beauty product of 2010 and 2011. It was not expensive too. After using for three days, my skin is tearing off my face; the peeling of skin is dropping off my face and onto my body. If I use my hand to touch my face, I can get the peeled off skin on my hand. 80% of my face is burned and very painful, the most painful area is the place near my eye. I now look so red that like a lobster since my face is completely burnned. I do not why I get burned by using this product since there has been no sun for these days and I do not go out at all. I also wore spf 50 face cream on top of my face. I have to see my doctor now.RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream, 1-Ounce TubeRoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream, 0.5-Ounce Tube"
2,Does not work,"Simple: keep your money in your pocket. It is a pleasant creme, but it does not hold up to its promise."
3,appearance,I just started using so it is hard to tell how effective this is in reducing deep wrinkles. I would imagine I would have a better idea after using the contents to the end of the tube.
1,Waste of money,This product is a waste of money doesn't work. Used it for a month and saw no results. Save your money.
1,Not impressed,"I began using this product about 4 nights ago. Immediately I noticed a burning feeling around my eyes. I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin. The label on the box said there may be tingling and redness. So, I thought it was normal. I've continued using the product, trying to stay away from the area around my eyes, but the area is red, peeling, and looks swollen. I didn't read on the label where it was harmful for the eye area, and that's the area I was most interested in improving. I won't be using this product anymore as the area around my eyes looks far worse than it ever did before. Maybe the actual eye cream works."
1,Review for Anyone with Sensitive Skin,"If you have sensitive & dry to combination skin, DON'T use this product.PROS: Sorry, but none.....CONS: After using it for only 1 night, my skin got really red and itchy. It felt like I had a sunburn on my face and neck. I used a tiny tiny amount, so you can imagine how strong this product is. It is supposed to leave the skin soft, smooth, and younger-looking...not true. My mom also tried this, and the same result....she said it was not for her either. It is not suitable for sensitive and dry skin."
3,I really wanted this to work...,"I am 39 years old and started off with a normal amount of wrinkles for my age. I waited to review this until I had used it for 12 weeks, so I would have a good idea what I thought about it. I took before pictures of myself when I started and compared myself to them. The verdict: I do not look 10 years younger like it said I would. I might notice a 5% improvement or that just might be me hoping the wrinkles have improved that much.The positives are that the tube lasted me a long time, and I do not mind the scent at all. I know some people have said they do not like it. I did experience some redness about 4 weeks into using it, but that went away. I was hoping that meant it was taking some of the wrinkles with it, but that didn't happen. So, in the end, it wasn't the miracle cream I was hoping it would be."
1,Terrible Product,"BUYER BEWARE! This product dried my skin out terribly, and burned my skin in several places. I am seeing a dermatologist next week. Don't waste your money!"
3,pleased,"This product works well, i have noticed a difference with the lines around my mouth, they are not as noticeable as they were."
4,BUY THIS.,"I saw a difference on my deep wrinkles on the first use. The ""-quote wrinkles between my brows and especially the deep wrinkles around my mouth. I even think that in the few weeks I have been using this, my skin is even better. I tried several over the counter products before, even tried DMAE products. None even touched my deep wrinkles. Now I am ordering the ROC Complete Lift Daily Moisturizer and deep wrinkle filler."
2,Powerful perfume smell to this cream,I'm not sure if I'll ever find out if this cream works. I may not be able to tolerate the strong perfume added to it. I wish beauty product manufacturers would figure out that too much perfume is not better.
2,Didnt do much for me,I am 41. I used this product all 12 weeks and only missed a few days. It made my skin burn and red. it did diminish my wrinkles but only very slightly. I would not recommend this product. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Red burning and dry scaly skin under eyes after use.,"Hi I just bought this product a few weeks ago off of amazon. I have just been putting it on the underneaths and corners of my eyes to hopefully stop more wrinkles from appearing there.The box does say that you will have irritation the first few times you use it. So I used it for two nights. On the third day under my eyes were scaly, swollen, and red. My throat was hurting and swollen too I think from the allergic reaction.My eyes are finally starting to feel better three days after not using anymore. I am just disappointed that this product had such a strong reaction and wasted my money.If you have sensitive skin I wouldn't use this product. If you do buy this do small test areas."
5,Excellent Moisturizer,Roc has been around for a long time and does the job of moisturizing quite well. Give it a try. The price is right.
3,So-so...,"I'm 24 and don't yet have issues with wrinkles but bought this product as a preventative to crow's feet, wrinkles, etc. I have sensitive skin and this product is too strong for me, it burns slightly and I get red and splotchy where applied. Unfortunate as I've heard great reviews for this otherwise."
3,"Nice Cream, But Nothing Special","I've been using this product for about three weeks now, and can't say I have seen any big changes. It's definitely not moisturizing enough to be considered a night cream. I wear it during the day and use it again at night in combination with my favorite Olay night cream. During the first few days of use I noticed my face was a bit pink - not sure if this is the 'glow' I was hoping to see. It has made my skin soft, but as for wrinkles and sun spots? No changes yet. I was hoping that at least by now that it would have had some effect on my sun spot and problem areas. I'll keep using it until the tube runs out - and based off how thin the cream is, that won't be very long."
2,Didn't work for me = (,I tried it and it totally burned the skin around my eyes (close to my cheekbone area). It was stinging for days! I have sensitive skin and I guess it was too strong or maybe I had an allergic reaction to something...idk. Just beware...if you have sensitive skin. Gave it to my older sister and she seems to like it fine and her skin is also ok as well so I don't think there is anything wrong with the product it's probably just me.
3,Can't tell yet...,"I bought RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream and started using it a couple of weeks ago. The cream is making some improvements, but I haven't used it for more than two weeks yet, so I do not have a full review to share yet. As of now, it seems like it's doing something and is improving my skin overall and on night's I do not apply the cream the next morning my skin does not look as good. I do not get that tingling sensation a lot of reviewers talk about. The cream goes on nicely and you don't have to lather it on to know that it has seeped into skin. Overall I guess I'm pleased with the product after 2 weeks of use."
4,Reduced my wrinkles,"This cream does dry the skin out a little, because of the retinol and it also causes the skin to peel mildly. Retinol overall is good for the skin as it promotes collagen and exfoliates the skin. You have to use a good moisturizer along with this product because of the drying effect, I use Cetaphil. I also use this once per night, and I never miss an application. Don't get it close to your eye's because it's pretty strong and caused some irritation around mine."
3,Roc Retinol Correction Deep Wrinkle Night Cream,"I have been using this product for over a month now. It does have a dry base, so if you have dry skin, you are not getting anything in the moisture department. I have not noticed any improvement with wrinkles, but will continue to give this product more time before deciding on whether I will continue to use it.I'm BzzAgent and I received this product from a BzzAgent campaign."
5,Works Great,"I started using this product because I read that at any age a retinol cream is a good idea. I am 24 so I don't really have wrinkles but other problems like breakouts and dryness, especially in winter. This cream smells amazing first off, also it's not greasy which is good if you have slightly oil skin and are prone to breakouts. This products hasn't given me any blemishes and I pair it with an anti-acne treatment with no problems. I would really recommend this product."
4,Great for skin brightening,"I love Roc products but can't afford to buy too many of them. The one product I highly recommend is the night cream. It helps keep my face bright and smooth. The only thing to watch out for is if you use face masks or wax, don't use the product the night before. It will cause your skin to burn or become seriously irritated."
1,Beware! This product has parabens,"I searched the internet before buying this product and couldn't find anything stating that this product contains parabens but I should have known since the ingredients list was not shown. Anyway, I got the package today and of course, it contains methylparaben and propylparaben. Parabens are synthetic preservatives used in cosmetics and personal care products, The danger lies in the fact that our bodies readily absorb parabens and studies show that parabens are hormone disruptors affecting our endocrine system by mimickng estrogen (in both men and women). Excess estrogen as you may know has the potential to cause breast cancer. Lesson learned. I will not buy any more products without seeing the ingredients label. Amazon, you could improve by being more transparent for your customers."
4,Amazing,"Amazing! This could be the best drugstore skin care product I have used. I have combination skin and always have mild-to-moderate sun spot issue on my cheeks....other than that, I have pretty great skin and happy with it. I purchased this product as I started to notice fine wrinkles around my lips, and decided to try a Retinol product. The texture of the product is a lightweight cream and it is absorbed so quickly when you apply it. I used it for a good solid week, and was shocked by the result. Not only did it diminish all the fine lines, it also improve my overall complexion and my skin is much brighter.The only downside is that you need to slather a thick layer of sunscreen EVERYDAY when you use this product as it makes your skin sensitive to sun exposure. I think winter is the best time to use a Retinol product and I will def repurchase when I run out of it."
1,didn't like it,Bought ROC retinol products after running out of retin a. This does not do the same as retin a. I couldn't stand the perfume smell. It made me break out. Going back to using retin a.
2,Smooth feeling creme but causes breakouts!!,"I couldn't use this product more than a week because it filled my face with acne. I get random small pimples once or twice a month (even more around that time of the month) but this lotion made three pimples appear in my face by day 4. I wasn't 100% sure if it was the lotion so I continued using it. At the end of the week I had around seven pimples all over my face. My face was not flattering from any angle! I stopped using it right away and my face went back to normal in two weeks. Not ready to throw away all my money, I decided a few weeks later to try this on my boyfriend and see what happen. He noticed the same breakout problem without me saying anything about the lotion. I definitely wouldn't recommend this for anyone who's prone to acne."
3,RoC Retinol - Ehh...,"I tried this product as an anti-ager. Haven't used it long enough to see much difference, altho retinols are supposed to -- over time -- help build collagen. It is non-irritating, but my problem with it is the base in which the active ingredients are carried. It is a pretty dry base and it does not spread very well. In order to get enough of the product to cover your face, you end up using quite a bit each time. This makes the product ultimately more expensive than others. Next time I will probably go with the Neutrogena retinol product, unless I find this one at a really good sale price."
2,Burned and flaked near the eyes,I guess I have sensitive skin because I bought this specifically for the wrinkles around my eyes and it burned and flaked my skin without removing any wrinkles. After reading many of these reviews I guess I should have done my research first.
1,"It Reeks! Strong Scent for ""old ladies""","I am rather shocked at the very strong, fake-flowery, 1950's perfume that dominates this cream. It is so overpowering it marks hair, clothes, sheets, furniture, the whole area you inhabit. If you have a husband/partner who is sensitive to scent, better think about this. I can not bear using it, so much perfume on the face gives me an almost instant headache. Some people will like or not mind the smell, but I really hate it. It screams ""old fashioned, little-old-lady wearing too much bad perfume""! And of course, if you are wearing a perfume you like, this will overpower and ruin it. Why not make a face cream unscented? This product is ridiculous!"
3,caution!,Bought this product after researching the benefits of retinol it certainly gives the skin a youthful glow and smooths wrinkles but DO NOT USE AROUND THE EYES i did and the effect is like burns swollen red tender and more wrinkled than before ! I am hoping this goes away in time just be careful when using it because its powerful stuff
2,No effect ...,"I bought this about 5 months ago and have been using it religiously every night and yet I see no effect on my skin. The pores are the same size, the fine wrinkles are still there with no change .. am regretting buying this product. Guess it does not suit my skin at all.What surprises me is that there is absolutely no change !!! :((From a design perspective the cap is not user friendly ! Due to its length one keeps expecting more thread .. and then it suddenly falls off ... visually deceptive."
2,roc retinol correxion deep night,i didn't notice a positive effect in skin appearance after using the whole contents of this product. it has a highly perfumed smell and a greasy finish on the skin.
3,average,I didn't notice any difference after going through a full tbe of this expensive stuff. At least it did not irritate my skin.
2,Nothing but flakes!,"I have read some reviews before I purchase this product, but it does not work on me. My skin became too dry, ugly flakes around mouth. I thought it was temporary till my skin gets used to retinol. I was wrong! I stopped using it for a week, and reapplied on my face before bed time. My face turned like dried facial mask! I am on progress to recover from this mummy skin."
2,gave it a whirl,I have to be honest and say I haven't noticed a difference using this night cream. Maybe others have a different results but my pores and skin look the same. Its a nice cream but no real changes folks.
4,No irritation or bad issues here,"Like some of the other reviewers, I've got acne prone skin that's now also aging so good skin care is hard to achieve. After reading the reviews, I was worried about irritation, stinging, redness, and peeling with the Roc. I'm happy to report that I have not had those problems and I think others might avoid issues if they ensure that their skin is completely (seriously, completely) dry before application. I noticed this when in a rush one night--I smeared some on slightly wet skin and had a slight burning/stinging feeling instantly--something that has never happened when my skin was completely dry.As far as making me look younger, I don't think I've used it long enough to report on effectiveness yet."
5,RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream,Cannot go a night without this cream! Love it! RoC Retinol is to my face what chocolate is to my tummy!! Love the stuff! It has really reduced the lines around my eyes and my neck! Won't go without it anymore!
3,Be very careful,I am 54 years old and hoped this serum would work great. I can not say I have hada favorable response to the serum. I try to put the serum only on areas outside ofthe eye upper and lower lid areas. If I accidentally travel some of the serum onto my eye lid areait creates my eye lid to be like a water blister with raw areas in the eye crease.I only apply the serum lightly so it is not that I slather it on.If I put on an eye cream first and then the serum farther out from the eyes I do not have the problem.There are just those mornings like today when time is short and I forget to put the serum on last so there is noresidue on my finger tips before the eye cream goes on. It feels like my upper lid is burned.
5,ROC rocks,I am 53; oops almost 54 y.o. This product really helps mature skin. I have tried a helluva LOT of stuff in my time but i do notice lately the clarity of my skin. And the compliments i get. Give it a go- you won't be sorry
3,Not much so far but I beat the flaky skin stage!,"I am 37 and have been using for a month but have not noticed much of a difference. The skin around my eyes have slightly improved but thats it so far. I actually use twice a day and have not been affected by the dry skin stage like so many. For me the reason is because I use a face ointment (great product I have been using for years) instead of lotion. It is not heavy because my skin will be damp when applying so I have light, even coverage. This provides me with hydrated skin all day which lotion never seemed to do. I also apply the night cream on my skin when its damp so the strength is a little less intense (which is why I use 2x a day) and I can easily smooth over face, eyes, neck and chest. When my skin is dry, I have to use twice as much.I will continue to use. Everyone is different when it comes to skincare success, and Im sure that over time I will see more results. Good luck!"
2,I'm allergic to this product,"After using this product for 3 days, I felt a very burning sensation on my face and my face turned terribly dry and red. My face still looked terrible 1 week after I stopped this product. I don't intend to use this product again."
2,Smells like Fuel,"Never got a chance to rip the benefits of this oil. It smells just like a fuel (my friends confirmed) and I can not put in my mouth something that smells like a gasoline... I using it as a moisturizer for legs for about 3 weeks, but do not see any change :("
2,NOT FOR THE FAINTHEARTED,"Another reviewer stated this this product smelled like fuel. I should have listened; it is an apt description, though it also TASTES bad. I took a spoonful and gagged and gagged and gagged. Well, I finally got it down, I thought, and now I'm done with it. NOT! I belched the stuff for the next NINE hours! Always a glutton for punishment, I mixed a spoonful with my morning hot oat bran. It made the whole bowl unpalatable and I had to throw it out. I have ordered some wheat germ oil softgels, but if they make me belch fuel like the liquid, I'm throwing in the towel. Good luck to those of you made of sterner stuff....6/5/11 Addendum. I am now using the wheat germ oil softgels (made by a different company) with no undesirable side effects. No taste, no smell, no belching!"
4,easy purchase,"fast, reliable, reasonably prices, quick and easy download, good quality, stores easy within iCloud and imports seamlessly within iTunes. Good buy."
2,Eh,The Thunderpuss mix was disappointing. I like the red disc with the Rauhofer mix and the Red Square Mix the best.
4,"Give me Maidenhead, instead","In this time of manufactured plastic pop, toaster music, that just burns migrane's into my over commercialized soul--it's a relief to have band like Maidenhead. With their debut CD ""Dear Raquel,"" Maidenhead show these kids how a real band writes, records and performs good old fashioned rock music. Maidenhead are more than local flavored N.O. rock, they are soon to become and international phenomenon. They've got the tools to become bigger than the biggest. To go to the toppermost of the poppermost. If you want a taste of real rock, try Maidenhead instead.If yr ever in the N.O. area, or if they make their way to yr hometown, make sure to check Maidenhead live. They play a killer set."
5,Tony always delivers.,"Anthony Robbins always delivers. His message is powerful and helpful, I can not imagine anyone not benefiting from his work. Another book I really enjoyed was ""Life and Death on the Internet"" by Keith A. Schroeder. Both books combined allow you to manage and handle our break-necked speed internet connected world."
1,Procrastination,"It seems that Robbins has gone down hill over the years. He wrote his first book day and nite to get it out in time. This book has been put off one year after another. It was first scheduled to come out in 1998, then 1999, now 2000. Is something very wrong with this book? It seems that the man of life mastery has fallen into the depths of Procrastination!"
3,TNA Victory Road 2004,"While not a bad PPV it still has it's flaws. The Elimation Last Team Standing match bewteen America's Most Wanted & Triple X was HORRIBLE AS HECK. The Ladder match for the NWA World heavyweight championship between Jeff Jarrett & Jeff Hardy was sloppy but solid. The highlight & showstealer of VR04 was the 20 man X-Division Gauntlet match which was fast-paced,hard-hitting & fun. The Monster's ball match between Monty Brown,Raven & Abyss was a solid & hard-fought brawl and a good reminder of the 1990's ECW. The Midget match between Mascarita Sagrada & Piratita Morgan while not a bad match I still think of it as a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"" The rest are ok. I give this event a 5 out of 10."
5,Handy and stylish,"I was looking for a way to keep my PDA on my belt at work, so the case had to be good looking and functional (and not cost a fortune). This product fits the bill. The belt loop is strong and securely fastened to the case. The open top provides easy access and accommodates a wide variety of PDAs -- even my Palm Zire 72 inside its Rhinoskin metal hard case, which is overkill but it's nice to know that it's an option."
5,hope this gets it up to 5 stars average...,"hot beats from Dangermouse (who also has impressed me with his 'Grey Album') and on point rhymes from Jemini the gifted one. Who cares that he's not psycho-social all conscience about everything, eh's a good emcee having fun, and slaughtering toys...One of my favourite releases of 2003...peace,"
5,If you have not heard this album you are missing out,"I know that Danger Mouse is a house hold name now that he ripped and re-did the Beetles, but Ghetto Pop Life was his first commercial album that nobody knew about but one of my friends in 2002 through digging, and it was done with a great Brooklyn MC named Jemini (who is still virtually unknown) but this album embodies hip hop - not rap as its know today, BETTER, and if you have any interest in Hip Hop or just good music then cop this album!!! I only knew the name of the album starting about 2 years ago after wondering why some of the best albums of our time are never known....it was only known after Danger got popular."
4,One of the best albums released over the past few years!,"Dangermouse did not impress me in the least bit with his Jay-Z meets The Beatles trip. HOWEVER, when I popped in 'Ghetto Pop Life' I instantly became a fan. His production is addictive and at times gorgeous [RJD2 watch ya nuts!!]. Jemini, not the most infectious lyricist ever to grace a mic, but the combination of his tough voice and Mouse's free base soundscapes provides us with one of the best combos and albums completed in the past 2-3 years. I loved it [minus a few filler tracks] and still play it on a constant basis. Cant wait for their next release.This is a PERFECT album for a NEWBIE to the underground hip hop scene.Cop it."
3,"Circuits, Devices, and Systems","This book seems to be written for those who are already familiar with the subject matter.Many of the examples and problems have errors and while the theory is explained with mathematical depth, the concepts are underexplained. There are not enough examples to address the problems given, and there seems to be no solutions manual available to students (or instructors?).You had better be the type of student who reads ahead, and have an instructor who will explain things in depth if you are going to be using this book. I recommend using a different one to suppliment this one."
2,filled with errors,The one of the authers of this text teaches at UC Davis. The worked examples and questions in the book were basically taken from the work of his graduate students. This may explain the large amounts of errors found in both the examples and the problem sets. My professor has found so many errors that he no longer assigns problems that he himself has not personally checked. My professor realizes that there is nothing more frustrating than learning the methods taught in a text and not being able to reprduce the given answers. This text could also use more worked ( and corrrect ) examples of some of the more complicated problems. On the other hand it has nice pictures. (I hear the author was tranfered out of teaching electronics... I wonder if this is true)
2,Boring!,"I was sent this book with the newer one by the same author as a gift. When I was stuck at home with the flu I read through both, thinking there must be something good coming. I was wrong. They are boring and pretentious. Even with a background in history, and a graduate degree in Art History, I found it too forced, as though the author were trying very hard to impress someone. The characters were ridiculous, and the writing style was...well, pompous."
5,Don't Know What Books Jessica Was Reading,"I just finished this book, and admittedly, I wish I had read it before I read Nolta's second book, Lostlindens although I was able to enjoy both. Both are very easy reads and provide a great balance of mystery and humor. Having attended Yale, Grave Circle is an especially good read since it is obvious many of the places in the book were inspired by Yale. With all due respect, I am not sure what books the previous reviewer read and I am certainly not sure what her motivation is."
5,An Excellent Read!,I picked this up on the new book shelf at my local library on a hunch that it might be worth a read. I couldn't put it down. The good professor is a great mystery writer! I loved the characters.PS. I've ordered several copies to give as gifts to friends.
5,"If Jane Austen wrote a mystery, this would be it!","This is a great book! If Jane Austen wrote a mystery, this would be it! Like any good mystery it is a page turner that the reader cannot put down. However, unlike the typical mystery novel, this book is a wonderfully written, well-crafted work of literature. I especially loved the dialogues between Tig and Hi (Antigone and Hiawatha), the story's protagonists. Nolta is especially successful at melding juicy tidbits of life on a small college campus and beautifully written art historical anecdotes into the narrative. I cannot wait for the next book from the Ivory Tower Mystery Series!"
3,Needs a good editor,"Not a bad cozy, but more emphasis on character development and more interaction between characters would make this a more enjoyable book. Some of the sentences were almost unreadable due to their length and the number of parenthetical remarks included! That may impress some people, but I read for enjoyment, not to marvel at 60-70 word sentences!"
4,Insight Meditation - a beginner's view,"Each of the 12 lessons includes two dics of 40-50 minutes. The introduction discs seem thorough and set for the lesson objectives very well. The disc containing the guided meditation is easy to follow and is consistent with the introduction. I have allowed three weeks time for each lesson which will allow for course completion and some lesson reviews within the one year course period. I have enrolled with the Dharma Foundation and have been assigned an advisor. The advisor has been extremely helpful. One disc was defective and I called Sound True who immediately made arrangements to replace it. In summary, the course is exceeding my expectations."
3,Well thought out but overpriced.,"12 lectures and 12 guided meditations with artful study guide. Very impressively packaged. Probably originally formated for 12 cassette tapes. All the sessions are 30-45 minutes long (enough for one side of a cassette tape). Goldstein's lectures are the most interesting. Salzberg's are to me, rather simplistic. If I had it to do over, I would have paid no more that $75."
5,The Twelve Conditions of a Miracle,"I have read many inspirationional books over the years and I loved this one. I particularly like the suggestion to meditate on a daily basis. I know for myself meditation has brought miraculous transformation into my life many times. When I was trying to purchase a restaurant one time I was meditating daily and the cafe sold before I could negotiate terms to another buyer. I wanted it for 1/2 of what it was being sold for. I continued to meditate and went and got a job (before the new owner opened) working for the new owner as his chef. Within two weeks he backed out of the deal and the seller phoned me to talk. We negotiated a deal for 5,000. less than I had wanted to pay! Half of the original asking price. Visualization DOES work. Be steadfast. Keep faith. I personally believe in more specific focus than the author of this book, but that's me. Just keep focused with excitement and emotional intensity. Be happy. Your dreams will come true."
3,"I tested Revlon Age Defying Makeup, SPF 8, ...","I tested Revlon Age Defying Makeup, SPF 8, Natural Beige. I found it no better or worse than other makeup I've used. I don't feel that it's worth the price. The texture was smooth and blended well with my skin, but I prefer my usual Cover Girl."
4,"I've seen this product in the store, but ...","I've seen this product in the store, but the price is what stopped me from purchasing it. Now I am a true believer in this product. Whatever is in it, it works. I've already recommended this to my family and friends."
3,a mini-LP by another obscure 80s band re-discovered by Almacantar,"Determined to bring lost alternative bands of the 80s to CD, the Almacantar label this time brings us a 6 song EP from a band who is sort of a combination of INXS and bands of the late 80s like The Models and Curiosity Killed the Cat, with some funky bass, a lot of wailing guitar, a hint of synthesizer, and plenty of orchestral stabs. Their sound strays away from the 'new wave' label more often than not, moving into the territory of power pop rock of the late 80s. The songs aren't quite catchy or memorable enough to have caught on when they were recorded, which would explain why the band didn't have any success on the radio. If I had to pass on one of the Almacantar reissues this would probably be it. Track listing is:1. Cruising in my Car2. A Girl Like You3. Nervous4. I Wanna Dance With You5. Lost With Love6. You're Breaking My Heart"
5,HOT!!!,"More Rock than Retro, More Psycho than 'Billy, this may be the best punk album that doesn't sound anything like Blink-182 of 2001. Every song on here is great and dare I say original sounding, a very strong CD from start to finish. The songwriting is superb & the musicians are on fire! Stylistically, a Midwestern combination of the Clash & the Paladins. Highly Recomended."
1,Not fun,Buy a roundhouse instead. It is impossible to switch tracks if you have more than a few cars attached to Engine.
4,Music where I want it,This has got to be the easiest way to get your music from one area to another. I am very happy with the quality of sound that I am getting from this. Also one of the easiest pieces of equipment I have installed.
4,Roxanne Cocores December 9 2011,"I love this book it made me laugh,cry, and it taught me about the life a Indian and a Cowboy if you like adventure and friendship trust me you will love this book"
4,A Good Story,"This was a great book, but it didn't hook me. Lynne Reid Banks is a great writer and I love her books! The Indian in the Cupboard was exciting at times, yet dull at others. If yu like magical stories, you should read this book!"
4,The Indian In The Cupboard,"The book The Indian In The Cupboard is a book about a young boy named Omri. He gets an old wooden cupboard for his birthday from his older brother.His mother gives him a key that is very important to her because it was the last thing that her grandmother gave her before she died. Just by luck that key fit the cupboard perfectly.The first night that he has the cupboard he puts a small little plastic Indian in it and when he opens the cupboard it comes to life. Through the book omri experiment with the cupboard by putting other things in it, like Star Wars action figures and bringing them to life.I really like the book because it lets your imagination take over. I would recommend this book to anybody of any age. Ilike this book alot and I know that other people will like it too."
3,I want to do something but I can't. But it's imagitive.,Some times they do kind of stupid stuff. I want to tell them not to but I can't. It seems so real. I don't want enything to go wrong. I don't think you can find any other book like this!Age 10
2,TheIndian in the cupboard is very fasinating,I liked Boone.Everyone called him cry baby.He didnt get along with Little Bear at first.Boone was the cowboy.Boone was married to Star.They lived happily ever after
1,BORING!,At some parts in the book I wish I was stuck in a cupboard rather than reading the book because I could find more interest in the wall of the cupboard then I found in this book. I think there should have been fight scenes because it was mostly all talk. There were only a few scenes where there was a major problem and the only cool part was when the cowboy and the indian got in a fight other than that the book wasnt that exciting. Although when he took the indian to school that was also a exciting scene.
1,If Text to speech is enabled & reading properly I will buy the item,My 8 year old son is enjoying this hard copy book but reading from my kindle encourages him more. The Text to Speech really helps him. I downloaded the sample and am very disapointed that the text to speech is not enabled. If they would enable it to read the book properly I will purchase it!
4,The Indian and the Cupboard: A book filled with magic !,"The Indian in the Cupboard is a great book that is filled with magic and excitement. A boy named Omri is given an old metal cupboard for his birthday. He put a plastic Indian in the cupboard and it comes alive! A very exciting book, you won't want to stop reading it."
4,"""This book will make you become REAL!""","A boy named Omri gets a cupboard for his birthday present and then finds a key.One of his presents is a indian.His friend is Pactrice,Omri has two brothers .One is named Adiel, throuhg the book they go throuhg conflices.I liked this book because it's alot like me and my littile brother.I love how boone talks."
5,An excellent book for use in a learning unit in grades 3-5.,"I have used this book as a starting off point for study of Native American Culture, Geography, History, Math, Language Arts and Science, as well as for character lessons in 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades. The characters, the different times in history they come from, and the distances they travel through the cupboard all lend themselves to creating an excellent combined teaching unit. The story is compelling for children in these age groups (and for the adults teaching!) and this book can easily be used as a springboard for studying every subject taught in these grades. It's a fun read, too."
4,I loved this book!,"I thought the Indian in the Cupboard was great. It was interesting and fun to read. I wish I had a magic cupboard. When Omri received his cupboard and brought the Indian, Little Bear, to life, I felt like I was actually there!"
3,Indian in the Cupboard,This book was great. i had a fun time reading it out loud because you could feel when somthing good was coming. it was very exiting when it got to the climax. this boy named omri and his best friend patrick was having a birthday party at omris house because it was omris birthday. omris sister got him a cupboard for his bathroom. he decides to store some of his plastic toys inclueding a indian named little bear and a cowboy named boone. they come live if you lock it with the key that the cupboard came with. that was what omri and patricks suprise was. i would totally recamend this book. it was great.
3,The best book I have ever read.,"If you like Indian and cowboy books you should read The Indian in the Cupboard. It is an incredible story. If you read it, you would not want to put it down because both of the little people named Little Bear and Boone talk sweet and funny.Laina3rd GraderMichigan"
4,This book was OK....,This Book is OK because it's funny and interesting. It was sad because the boy started crying at the end of the book when the indian left him. I don't know what else to say about the book except that it was good. I would recommend this book to other kids.
4,the indian,I recently read this book called The indian in the Cuboard by Lyne Reid Banks. One of my favorite scenes is page eight when the boy opens the cuboard and he sees the Indian. What I remember from this book is the book is a really intresting story to read because the boy likes to become friends with Indian. Also when the boy picks up the Indian and the Indian cuts the boy. At the end they become best of friends. I recommend this book to kids who like action.-Rosendo salinas
4,Fantasy and history,"The book was an interesting read. It uses the magical, never quite explained cupboard and key to introduce some key points of American history and culture and race relations. Setting the story in England added another dimension to the story that gave the author reason to add extra explanations to Little Bear and Boone's needs."
4,The Change In A Kid,"I read the book The Indian in the Cupboard by Lynne Reid Banks. I liked how Omri changed during the book, because of the Indian. Omri learned more responsibility. The Indian, Little Bear also grew more responsible as Boone came along. Boone and Patrick also became more responsible.In the beginning Omri was not really paying much attention to the presents he got for his birthday. Because he just left them on the floor. Once Little Bear came to life he realized that it was real and had to take care of it.If Little Bear is responsible for anything Omri would take the blame so he wouldn't be discovered. Omri grew very close to Little Bear. And because of this the Indian grew more responsible.The main point is that Omri changed each day that the Indian was there. His changes were small but they were changes. I don't think anyone will ever change Omri back. I really liked this book and you will probably like it too.Chris a 6th grader"
1,the racism overrides anything else,"I am appalled that all these reviewers are either ignoring or are unaware of the offensive stereotypes in this book. If you read ANY multicultural education literature, this book is at the top of every list of offenders. In this day in age, we need to do better for our children."
1,Racially Insensitive and BORING,"I was required to read this book for a graduate class in multicultural children's literature, and am surprised more reviewers are ignorant to the blatant racism throughout. Talk about Native American stereotypes! Furthermore, it's EXTREMELY boring. I like to think I have an easy time getting through most texts, but this was just torture--not interesting AT ALL."
2,Was ok,"I had a higher expectation of the things offered, but it does have a large vocab list at the front. The questions that they offer for comprehension aren't seperated by chapter. They are grouped chapters 1-6, 7-12, etc. Which doesn't help you much when you haven't read the book in 20 years and can't remember what chapters these things happen in. So you're remembering as your reading to the class. I would have loved to see it broken up into chapters, maybe have some reproducible quizzes?"
2,"The book was a little below average, but not much.","I thought The Indian in the Cupboard was okay. Definitely not the best book I've read though. The characters were well created, but the story was a little childish. I think it would be a good book for young readers. I only liked it beecause of the realistic fighting. Without the action it would have been boring."
4,Indian in the cupboard,"Lynne Reid BanksFantasy;FictionOmnri likes plastic figures and buys a indian.His family gives him an old cupboard. The cupboard is magical and brings plastic figures to life.How Omnri and Little Bear finds obstacles,and solves them in many waysI didn't like the part the friend Pete because you knew what he would do before he even does it.Little Bear; because he is very brave for an indian who is just 2-inch tall.They were all at the living room looking at the present;It was an old, white medicine cupboard;3pg.;I liked that passage because all this ""magic"" and adventure started whith just that big, old,cupboard.It is a good book for people who like fantasy and rare adventures, and has a plot that can hook you to the story.What would happen to the cowboy if he returned, and would he react violent like he did before.My strongest recommentation for this book is that any age can read this book and still enjoy it."
4,Stirs the imagination!,"I'm reading this book to my 7-year-old son and each time we settle down for a read he starts screaming, ""I LOVE this book!"" He identifies with Omri's delight in his Indian coming alive and is struck by the way Omri learns to love and respect him. My husband and I are enthralled by the story as well. The author has done a tremendous job of ""getting inside"" a little boy's head! Well done and highly recommended."
4,THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD!,"THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD is and about a boy who gets a plastic indian for his birthday and puts in a cupboard. When he opens the cupboard the next morning he finds that they indian has come to life! At first Omri thinks that taking care of his indian will be fun, and it is, sort of. But after his friend Patrick makes a cowboy come to life, things really start to get rowdy. Can Omri and Patrick keep the peace between the two little men?What will happen if someone discover's them? Find out in, THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD!I think this is a really good book because it has a lot of suspense and excitement. It's also funny even though sometimes the way things are happening its usetting or sad in some way, but Lynne Reid Banks always figures out how to make a joke out of it. The best part is, if you're too busy to read it you can listen to it on CD! Try it, you're bound to like it. Sarah E."
5,Why Can't Things Like The Cupboard Be Real?,"A boy named Omri receives a magical cupboard that makes his action figures come to life. First there is an Indian, later a cowboy. The magic in this novel is not only the powers of the cupboard but the way the boy and the living figures interact. This book is such fun... It gives your imagination a pleasant workout. Recommended for any and all!"
2,"THIS AUDIOBOOK IS ""NOT"" UNABRIDGED!!!","Unabridged audiobooks are supposed to be the original text. This is not the case. This audiobook is revised. Even the name of the Indian has been changed. The packaging lists this as ""Complete & Unabridged"". It is read by the author who knows the text, so she knew that it was a revision when she read it (She probably made the revision), making this an even more odious lie. If an author is going to revise thier story, let us know. Don't get me wrong updating is okay, but let us know.I got this audio book so my kids could listen and read along. With the inexplicable changes, it was useless for this purpose. Again don't get me wrong, the story is still good. I just feel that the words ""Complete & Unabridged"" should be a standard, that means the original text, UNCHANGED."
3,This book is interesting.,The Indian in the Cupboard is a very funny. book. It is very mythical. The cowboy is my favorite character. I thought it was very interesting because it twisted fiction with reality and . I really liked this book.
2,Review of the Audiobook - Educators Beware,"I recently purchased the audiobook of The Indian in the Cupboard for use in my classroom. I work with students who struggle with their reading and reading along with an audiobook increases student comprehension of the material. I was disappointed to discover that the author (Lynne Reid Banks) changed parts of the audio version. At first, I only noticed a few changes, such as trousers for leggings. Then I discovered that she completely changed parts of the text by doing adding descriptions and by changing Little Bear's name to Little Bull. I'm not sure why the author felt it necessary to make these changes, but it makes it difficult for students to follow along in the book when the audiobook does not follow the text word for word. If you plan to use the audiobook in an educational setting, be aware of these changes.On the plus side, Lynne Reid Banks has a very pleasant reading voice. It is enjoyable to listen to her."
3,the indian in the cupboer,I think that the story was cool. Because the toys become real. I never read a story like that that was the cool part. The story was realy good i recamended to everyone it is for the family to sea. And the best part of the book was when the rat almost killed Little Bear. I think that kids shode read this story.
3,The Indian in the Cupboard,"I discovered the story about the Indian in the Cupboard when I saw the film based on the book. I think the book is quite good, but I would like to have more illustrations, because I'm teacher of English for Spanish students and if you want to use the story for early ages (6-8) you'll need more illustrations. But in general I liked this book very much."
3,The Classic Early recordings,"A mixture of various recordings, not all of them good. Still there are a few gems amongst them."
5,An excellent exposition on a very bizarre topic,"I knew a little about the Kumari when I found this title in a mail order catalog. I had to buy it! Who would invent something like this? If you're interested in strange aspects of different cultures, this is the book for you. Very informative and entertaining. Wish I could get it in hardcover."
4,Frothy chik-lit,"An easy beach read that goes down without a hiccup. Lauren is a successful wedding planner who has been less successful in her own personal life. Nick is a studly fireman who seems determined to remedy the situation. A series of snafus in her business put everything in jeopardy, and Lauren learns you can't always plan EVERYTHING."
4,Pretty Good Chick-lit,"""I Do (But I Don't)by Cara Lockwood, is a better than most Chick-lit. Ms. Lockwood writes in the first person about Lauren Crandell a wedding planner, who has everybody else love life under control, but not her own. Durning the course of two weddings, Lauren meets handsome firefighter Nick Corona. But due a misunderstanding Lauren thinks Nick is going to marry Psycho Bride Darla. I won't give away the ending, all is well. Some reader many think that Ms. Lockwood drags the books, but this makes it even more fun for the reader."
5,Very funny chick-lit,"This book more than made up for my disappointing experience with another chick-lit book. It revive my faith in the genre by having a realistic-thinking heroine, hilarious situations that the heroine overcomes with a certain flair, and of course the guy who truly appreciates her for the imperfect woman that she is. I look forward to reading more of her books."
4,Kept me laughing,"I really liked this book. I love the way Lauren comes into herself and learns to stand up for herself. She learns that not everything is going to go exactly as planned and every once in a while, things work out for you, not against you. It's a little annoying how she feels sorry for herself all the time, but in the end I think it's important in the development of her character. Lauren is always jumping to conclusions and believing everything that she hears, which makes for really funny drama. The series of misunderstandings only thicken the plot and draw you more and more into the story. The contrast of her completely organized professional life and the utter disaster of her personal life makes for great comic relief. Overall, this is a book that I would put away to read again.-recommended"
2,I do not!,"Sadly, this book did not interest me the slightest bit. It was very predictable and so much like the movie The Wedding Planner. It was the 1st book I'd read from her and I have to say, I'm not tempted to read another. There are plenty of other good authors out there, no need to stop here!"
3,A-Ok!! Chick-lit book!!,"I have to admit, I skimmed this book sometimes. The only fun parts where when she was with Nick and not being a wedding planner, I feel the author waited too long to bring in the story line at the begining of the book. It dragged in some spots and then the ending was the real treat. Such a messed up family she has to deal with, left alone the one she lives with now (her own). Read it if your getting married, or a wedding planner for a laugh, but if your looking for a serious book gto settle down with, I'm afraid I would pass on this one."
3,Cute Romantic Comedy,This book was cute but had no real plot to it. I like Cara Lockwoods writing style though. Not a bad read.
4,Frothy chick lit,"An easy beach read that goes down without a hiccup. Lauren is a successful wedding planner who has been less successful in her own personal life. Nick is a studly fireman who seems determined to remedy the situation. A series of snafus in her business put everything in jeopardy, and Lauren learns you can't always plan EVERYTHING."
3,fun debut,"I'm glad that I picked up Pink SLip Party first. If I had picked up this one first, I might not have gone on to read her other works. At least she's getting better as she goes along instead of worse.While this book kept me turning pages, I did find the similar-sounding names confusing. Last I checked, a writer shouldn't give a bunch of characters names that begin with the same letter. Also the misunderstandings made the book drag in the middle. It was like Three's Company, where everything would have gotten solved if people just communicated.Nick had the potential to be a good hero (who doesn't love a fireman?), but there were places where he was wooden and too Fabio-esque, for lack of a better word.But on a positive note, I liked all the details of psycho brides and intrusive MOB's."
5,ten-best battle account i have read,"if anyone would like to contact me with specific info on the 9th ss panzer division ""hohenstaufen"" that fought at arnhem in sept. 1944, i would be very grateful."
3,not entirely awful...,"the disk gets off to a REALLY slow start, but give it a chance. it's no masterpiece, but it's a good way to get exposed to new bands or bands you've never heard of. i'd say maybe half the songs are keepers..."
2,Not that good...,"I bought this CD for the Alkaline Trio song I didn't know, and that's the only song I liked on the CD... If you're a fan of mindless yelling, you'll like the rest of the CD..."
3,clever entertainment,"not as eclectic and adventurous as their previous works, sounds like a conscious attempt at reaching a wider audience with a more conventional pop-rock oriented product. The songwriting is good.Overall an above-average CD (for the market, not for the band) that's certainly worth listening to and possibly buying."
5,DEUS VOICE,"And suddenly the room was filled with the very warm and known sound of Deus.We did wait for this album long time now all of us who believed in the group and we can say it was more than worthy. Bad Timing opens this latest work and proves in seconds that it does not come in bad timing at all to be followed of 7 Days, 7 Weeks which sounds like a inspired pop hymn with simple forms.The guitars keep on playing an important role giving you the impression that they are in a non stop dialogue between them.You will feel it when you hear the Cold Sun of Circumstance but in Night shopping the rock air the song brings is going to remind you where you come from.Listen to this great cd I believe it is worthy."
4,Fun!,"""Power Rangers Mystic Force: Dark Wish"" is a fun movie because there is lots of action and cool moves by the Power Rangers. There's also a few interesting surprises."
5,Power Rangers Gets Better & Better.,"Finally, Power Rangers that is better thought out & doesn't insult the intelligence of the youngsters."
2,WHEEL COVER...,"IT IS VERY CUTE, HOWEVER I HAVE A NEW CIVIC, IT FITS BUT HAS MAYBE AN INCH EXTRA. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ONLY THOES WITH LARGER STEERING WHEELS."
3,After 6 months,"After six months of use. The color of the hearts have faded and the borders are cracked and peeling, but I guess nothing beats the hot so-cal sun.It did look good for the first couple of months and installation to a sentra was easy and a good fit.It still protects my hands from the hot and cold which was my purpose of buying it."
3,Heart steering wheel cover,"It looks really cute and matches the rest of the heart accessories very well, however, it doesn't really fit my steering wheel. I'm sure it's not the fault of the manufacturer and just the fact that my steering wheel is big. I ""modified"" it and use is anyway though!"
3,Smelly,"My girlfriend purchased this using my account, and when she put it on her steering wheel it smelled a lot--like cheap pleather or soemthing. We took it off and let it air out for a while, and its fine now. it doesn't get the steering wheel hot in the Florida sun anymore, so I guess thats good enough."
4,Hearts Steering Wheel Cover,A bit large for my steering wheel. It does make it nice as far as not gripping a cold/hot wheel when driving. Very colorful.
5,Good recorder,"This product was good. It plays music, it has a book with it. It is what it said it is. That's about it."
4,"Ishi, the Man","According to the story, Ishi (which means Man) was the last surviving member of his tribe. The made for TV video stars Jon Voight as an anthropologist interested in Ishi's (played admirably by Graham Greene of Dance's With Wolves fame) life story. The video is certainly interesting reliving Ishi's life experience's even though there's a ""Native American bashing"" theme to it."
3,Forgettable End,"So far, I think as an overall contribution to the Dark Horse Clone Wars series, this has been the weakest book. I really enjoyed everything but Yoda: The Best Blades at the end.The first 3/4 helped advance the storyline with Obi Wan and Alpha, but then the entire story-telling experience changes with Yoda: The Best Blades. The style and tone of the story is dis-similar to anything so far in the series. There were basic elements that helped define Yoda and his support for the war, but I really couldn't get past the Japanese drawing. If I wanted that style of storytelling, I would've bought The Best Blades as a stand-alone.Of course, whether I loved the book or not, it is book 5 of 9, and the story must continue. You can't leave out such big plot points as introduced here."
4,Excellent Series!,"The whole Clone Wars series of graphic novels does a great job of filling in the space between Episode II and Episode III. Although there is are a couple of continuing storylines through the whole series, this one also includes a one-shot with Yoda exploring the ethics of the war."
1,THIS MOVIE IS DIRT!,"Thank God I rented this movie instead of buying it. This is a travesty to zombie movies. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the script was written by a 14-year old as a lame creative writing assignment for his/her English class. Watching the actors deliver this horrible dialogue is painful. The film is also packed with lots of editing errors and dubbing that makes this movie ridiculous. How on earth anyone could stand watching this and enjoy it, I don't know. Lucio Fulci could deliver imaginative zombie films with his own personal stylistic touch and George Romero could deliver zombie films as being dramatic and realistic. But this film is just trash. Bottom line: I'd rather be fisted in my sleep than to have to experience the displeasure of viewing this movie ever again."
1,sh*t,im a huge horror and bad movie fan and was completely disapointed.this sucks and blows! skip it!
2,WHAT HAPPENED?!,"TOM SAVINI IS A GOOD MAKE-UP ARTIST, BUT THIS TIME AROUND HE DOESN'T DO THE MAKE-UP AND ONLY POPS UP FOR A FEW MINUTES. INSTEAD WE GET SAVINI IN ACTOR MODE. OH NO!BILL HINZMAN, WHO HAS WONDERFUL CHARM AS THE CEMETARY ZOMBIE IN NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD AND HECK EVEN THE CHEESY FLESH EATER, IS INVOLVED IN THIS ONE TOO, BUT THIS TIME AROUND HE DOESN'T DO ANY ACTING IN THE MOVIE! DOUBLE OH NO!!THIS HAD A CHANCE AT BEING SOMETHING SLIGHTLY COOL AT LEAST IF SAVINI HAD BEEN THE EFFECTS GUY AND HINZMAN HAD DISPLAYED THE SPARK HE HAS AS HIS ZOMBIE ALTER-EGO. MAYBE THEN THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT, BUT NOOOOO. WHY WOULD YOU NOT HAVE SAVINI DO MAKE-UP AND PUT BILL HINZMAN IN THE MOVIE IN THE ROLE HE HAS MADE FAMOUS AND HAS A KNACK FOR?! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!"
1,"The worst, avoid at all costs!","Being a big 'Living Dead' fan, and seeing Tom Savini's name on the box, I bought this title immediately. Starts off well, but about the time Tom buys the farm, the movie goes bad, really bad, UNBELIEVABLY BAD. The rest is a hodge podge of sillyness that Ed Wood would envy, INCLUDING styrofoam headstones in the graveyard (you know, the ones that you can buy at Halloween for $10). Awful, just awful film."
1,They won't let me give it a zero!,"This is NOT part of Romero's DEAD series or another sequel to RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD! Consider yourselves warned. I rented this movie with a friend last Halloween thinking it would be bad but I never could have imagined how bad it was.The first fifteen minutes, with Tom Savini rounding up the undead in the countryside, seem promising enough but It's all down hill from there. After that this becomes filth, nothing more. Straight to video... that should have never even made it that far. The idea of a master zombie? Come on, how ridiculous is that? This film is a terrible addition to the zombie genre which hopefully will not be remembered at all by anyone. Wanna see a good, new zombie film then watch RESIDENT EVIL, it's far better than this."
1,the worst!!!,"This sucks! I didn't think it would be THIS bad! Russo's movie was supposed to be about kids from mothers bitten by the original living dead. He explained that at horror conventions and I was eager to see that idea. These kids (children of the living dead) were going to hit puberty and start another zombie outbreak. What happened to that idea? They took the title and killed Russo's idea and made up another ""plot""! This is incomprehensible crap! WHY? And Savini didn't do make-up! WHAT?! Hinzman isn't in it either! He's in the crew or something instead of in the movie! He should be in the movie! Where the hell is he?! How can you blow it with those three guys involved and the Living Dead concept to back you up?! Savini and Hinzman and Russo got put on the back burner and instead we get this crap served by Tor Ramsey and Karen Wolfe?! Who the hell are they? What horror films have they done? THIS IS JUST AWFUL!!"
3,"Well, hmmm.....","This movie is ok. The first ten minutes rock, but then the movie does a 180 degree turn. I still have it in my collection. It is good to watch the first time, every time after put it in while you are busy doing something else for background noise. Don't feel bad if you hate it!"
2,Just Dont,"This movie only gets 2 stars because it has zombies and is on DVD, other than that it realy realy stinks. I am probly the biggest zombie buff there is and i couldnt stand to watch it but once. At the beging it looks to be the start of a good B zombie movie, but then they move to the ""present day"" and it stinks from there on out..... the ""master zombie"" is just a joke. Stick withthe real movies unless you are a TRUE diehard. We write these reviews to save your time. Trust Me STAY AWAY!!!"
1,really awful crap,"I love bad movies. Ed Wood is my GOD! I champion the cause of tons of films that many hate because I honestly love them. I'm the guy who found broadly despised flicks like Texas Chainsaw 4 and Return to Salem's Lot to be fun. I thought that this one might fit the same bill. I couldn't wait to see it. Now I have and can honestly say that Children of the Living Dead SUCKS! Why is it so bad? Because they didn't even try on any level. They just figured they could make a buck off the ""Living Dead"" label. It even seems like they screwed not only us but also Savini, Russo, Hinzman, and everybody involved. The folks in charge of this abortion clearly didn't care one bit about the movie or the audience. They just wanted quick cash at the expense of everything and everybody. Ed Wood was far better than this. Ed at least had decent sound! How hard is it to get semi-decent sound? The dubbing in this is awful! It's lousy on every level."
2,My Hometown is Now Makin' Movies,"Terrible production values, ridiculous story and subpar acting. The only reason worth seeing it: the ""dramatic"" scene of a zombie attack on a restaurant was filmed near my hometown in Columbiana County, Ohio. (East Palestine, Ohio, - Rt. 14 to be exact).Unless you've found this beast at a yard sale, then take a pass."
1,What?,"I'm sure Tom Savini is still trying to figure out how he got mixed up in this one and so am I. It started off with a lot of potential, where Night of the Living Dead left off, shooting zombies in the field. Well after the opening scene this movie falls apart or should I say is ripped apart by a lot of bad acting and a really bad story. Tom Savini is lucky his character is killed off in the first scene. The rest of the movie is based around some cockamamey story about some guy named Abbott Hays who killed a lot of people however many years ago and he's still be alive and eating dead people which brings them back to life as zombies which are, after all, required to make this an actual zombie movie and so on and so forth, etc., etc., blah blah blah.In short, buy a GOOD zombie movie, a category in which this movie does not fall."
1,"Don't take the time to watch, rent, buy, borrow, steal....","This movie was complete garbage. I can't believe how bad it was. The plot was inane (Abbott Hayes, the head zombie does little more than growl a lot and stand in a cloud of 'fog' looking menacing), the dialogue sounded absolutely made up on the spot (""Zombies aren't interested in children""), the cinematography was laughable (in one scene, there is a close up on the door of a truck. It was a shiny door. The cameramzan was smiling. Not just for that truck but for 4 trucks where you could see the crew clearly in every door).The action was absurd. All zombie bites were lunges with fast cutaways to bad blood makeup.Not only isn't this a sequel to Romero, this isn't even worthy of someone that once knew him.John Russo, if you are reading this...how could you sell this swill to the public????"
3,"Not a ""Living Dead"" sequel...","This movie starts out with ALOT of promise.It starts out almost identical to how Night Of The Living Dead ended, probably intentional to represent an indirect ""sequel"". Tom Savini is in the opening scene as the Sheriff blasting zombies and kicking ass, then he dies... and so does this film.If you can get this used for like $3 then do so, otherwise... perhaps find another zombie flick."
3,Hillarious,"Okay people, this movie sucked as a horror movie. And why is everyone saying : Warning, this isnt a Romero living dead series movie? I think people would know that, if it were to be..on the cover it would say George Romero's Children Of The Living Dead, and it doesnt, does it? So obviously its not. Sure, this movie was horrible in the horror/thriller category..and I admit i was expecting something a little better, but all the same this movie wasn't as bad as everyone is making it out to sound. It is actually pretty funny, the characters lack so much depth, and their acting skills are so horrible it is just so funny when people get scared, or try to run away from the zombies. Anyhow...if you can't find any good movies..pick this one up..sure its not scary..and u wont gain anything from it..and you will forget it easily..but this movie is just to funny to miss out on, it should be Scary Movie 4 if you ask me."
3,o.k for a newer movie,"for coming out in the early 2000's, it's pretty cool. starts right were day of the dead left off. rent first"
5,Awesome movie to watch with friends,"There are good movies, and there are bad movies. And most of the time the bad movies are obviously *trying* to be good movies, but fail for whatever reason.This movie is unique in that it's utterly terrible while not even attempting to seem any good at all. It's as if the director has seen every movie ever made, but consistently tries to violate every horror/zombie(or any genre) movie rule ever made.It could easily pass for a comedy. In fact, it's one of my top 5 favorite movies for this reason: it's hilarious!My friends and I have watched this film countless times since 2001. In fact, when I worked at the local small town video store, it was one of the only non-new-releases that rented regularly.This movie is a gem, and I just spent the best $6.99 of my life.There's a simple reason I'm giving this movie 5 stars... because I can't give it 6."
1,THE WORST ZOMBIE MOVIE EVER!!!!,I SAW SOME STINKERS IN MY DAY BUT THIS ONE REALLY TAKES THE CAKE...DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE OR EVEN BOTHER RENTING IT. THE ONLY QUESTION THAT I STILL HAVE IS... WHY TOM SAVINI HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS
1,One of the worst independent horror films I've seen,"I have seen a lot of bad low budget horror flicks in my time, but this one takes the cake. The special effects are bad, the plot is non-existant, and there isn't even some decent erotic stuff to make up for it all. This movie reminded me of the old ""Revenge of the Living Zombies"" movie, but it doesn't even live up to that one. Only watch this one if you are a diehard zombie movie fan."
1,ugh,"Aw geez. Shame on you, Tom Savini! I typically love zombie movies and it is a given that most of them are ultra low budget, so that is a given. Well, this particular gem takes the cake in lame. I think ""ugh"" sums it up pretty well."
4,Children Of The Living Dead,"PLOT: Its a typical plot, some kind of chemical spill brings the dead back to life in a small town in Pennsylvania, and the towns people have to fight back. There are a few twists in the plot.ZOMBIES: I think the zombies look really good for the most part. Well done.GORE: Not to heavy on the gore for a zombie movie, but some. Not the best but not bad.NUDITY: NoneDVD: The quality is good, and Artisan Entertainment did an overall good job puting the package together.NEGATIVES: Id say the thing I didnt like is the Abbot Hayes Zombie, it was just cheezy and gay.OVERALL: Overall I liked this movie, and its not like alot of people say it is. Tom Savini ruled in like the first 10 mins of the movie killin zombies. If your a big zombie movie fan check this out."
1,I really wanted to like this movie....,"but the inane story, the dialogue that sounds completely improvised (and post-production dubbed, no less) made it impossible. When I heard the Tom Savini didn't like the movie at all, I resolved to try it anyway. After all, if this one made money, maybe they'd get Romero to film one the right way.Oh, god this is BAD! Bad story (""Zombies don't care for children"") bad acting, bad makeup (Ok, so the zombies in Dawn of the Dead wore similar green/gray makeup...GAR has said that he regrets that choice in makeup).Just bad. Look onward. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Run from it. Take that money and spend it on anything else."
1,waste of time,"this is horrible. they just slapped ""living dead"" on it to make a buck and put nothing in the movie to entertain anybody. one of the worst 'b movies' i've ever seen."
1,Worst Zombie film ever!,"As a fan of zombie films I was hugely disappointed by this film. Just awful! If you're a fan of living dead films - keep away fromthis. The storyline was ridiculous, the zombies were not scary, and the acting was just terrible. I've seen many low-budget Romero ... films with stupid plots and bad acting (and enjoyed most of them in spite of those challenges) but this one was no fun and a complete waste of time. The only good part was the beginning with a good zombie hunting sequence reminiscent of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead - other than that - this film should be avoided by zombie film fans.Thank goodness the DVD version has Spanish subtitles. At least I got to practice some foreign language skills. If it weren't for that, viewing this would have been a COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME."
3,I enjoyed it despite the poor reviews!,"I rented this movie even though the reviews were bad and I'm happy I did! Yes it had sound, plot, acting, etc. problems. But lighten up people, this movie had some cool zombie action! ...Believe me, I've seen MUCH WORSE zombie movies... than this. This movie should not be judged by Romero, Fulci or Argento type standards.Bottom line is, if you like good zombie action and don't mind a lower budget (with plenty of flaws, though not with the zombies) then this movie is a must see. If you only like the best of zombie flicks and hate lesser ones with bad acting, then steer clear of this one...Who knows how long we'll have to wait for the next Romero-Dead installment. ...Rent it."
2,Honestly? Poorly made movie.,"The cover is what sold me-it looked like a great zombie movie with awesome special effects. But it's not. Some of the make up was good on the zombies. But it was almost like watching a B-movie, without all the sex. The story was good, but the movie just seemed to drag on...And the poor acting makes it even worse. Don't waste your money buying this. Maybe you can catch it on the Sci-Fi channel some day."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,I like bad movies. I like zombie movies. I didn't like this! It's TERRIBLE. It's not even funny. It just sucks.
5,For Die Hard Zombie Fans!,"So many people give this movie such bad reviews but i notice that they like most of the movies i hate, but one thing they all said is that ""its for a dedicated zombie fan"".The day that i got this movie in the mail i watched it 3 times, then 2 the next day. I can see why people could hate this movie but i think some people expect too much. Im not gonna write ""so this movie starts out in this field full of zombies and then.."" if you want to know what this movie is about scroll up and read about it.If you think Resident Evil is the greatest zombie movie, dont buy this.. If you like Night/Dawn/Day of the dead and The return of the living dead then buy this!"
1,Children of the Needless Sequels...,"Night of the Living Dead ""sequel"" (which ignores the previous two NOTLD sequels). Plot: A superzombie, who has survived undetected by hiding in a house for 30 years, re-animates 5 auto accident fatalities. Subsequently, construction of a used car dealership, built on the site of a graveyard, unleashes the corpses for an evening of mayhem. Although it features Tom Savini (no fx work, just a small acting role) and was produced by John Russo, this is truly a miserable effort. Completely devoid of plot, special effects and production values, it in no way resembles the 1968 shocker."
1,Avoid it.,"I guess I'm what you'd call a zombie aficionado. I buy every movie I can find involving the walking dead. Doing so I've had to sit through some real stinkers and let me tell you, Children of the Living Dead is the worst.There are a lot of bad zombie films out there...Some have a bit of charm about them, Burial Ground for instance...Awful film, but an enjoyable watch. The only thing enjoyable about this film however, is when the credits roll.I guess I'll get into the story. It jumps around a lot which is pretty annoying, you've got Tom Savini doing karate...Some annoying sheriff with a huge birthmark on his face looking around an old farm house. Oh, and there's this zombie serial killer on the loose. Abbot Hayes, I believe that was his name.Sorry for real lack of a description, but that's all you really need to know about this movie. Bad acting, bad directing, awful script, did I mention bad acting?If you're a real glutton for punishment and you're dead set on seeing this film...Don't."
4,Smart and Useful,"I disagree with the negative review from a student. I'm a professor, and I've been using this text in a freshman composition course for about three years. Students have reacted, generally, very positively. They may struggle, at first, with the concepts, but they find the discussions and information enlightening. This is a great introduction to literacy studies. Not over-simplified at all, but challenging readers to think about concepts that they either take for granted or that others simplify in policy and practice. I recommend it!"
3,"Good, kinky, weird","The album starts off strong then fades into what I consder fast forward music until you can stop some time later and find some real hard drumming with great basslines. You can tell they smoke too much you know, unlike in the Chronic with DR. Dre where they will smoke you."
5,Timex Reef Gear 200M Diver Indiglo - Best watch I've ever had...,"All,The Timex Reef Gear 200M Diver Indiglo (Model# T53751 I think) - Best watch I've ever had! I had this watch years ago, and then 4 years ago, I saw another one in a store, and I bought it as a backup and put it in a drawer for safekeeping. I thoroughly expected to have both these watches until I died, but unfortunately I lost my original at an Airport Security checkpoint! So, now I am using my backup.I am looking for another one, but no luck so far as these are out of stock.This is a great watch, and I've never worried about them when I go snorkeling, swimming, ... whatever."
1,Ridiculously heavy and not waterproof.,"This watch is ridiculously heavy, and even so it's a dud as a diver's watch, which it earnestly claims to be. I took it down just thirty feet and it let water in. Returned it to the store where I bought it for full refund and good riddance to bad rubbish."
2,Suspect in the extreme,"This is a very average mp3 player indeed. It would seem from the descriptions to have a lot of functionality for a relatively inexpensive device. However the product description gives a false impression.The storage it is said to have would seem okay, however it begins to seriously wobble once you reach the 200 song mark. After that the songs lose all order in terms of songs from an individual album being grouped together. They then proceed to be spat out in any direction and many songs will simply be deleted.Also toggling between different functionalities on this device is a nightmare. The buttons are awkward to manipulate and the stick for skipping between songs and changing the volume malfunctions relatively easily.All in all, even at this budget price, I would not recommend buying this product."
1,"A horrible, horrible player.","Actually, this is an ok player...until it dies. My player died after a week of use. Avoid this at all cost."
4,"Works great! I'm being gentle with mine, though.","So far, after three uses, I have had no problems with my PastaDrive motor. I do have a couple reservations about giving a 5 star review though:1. The motor housing is metallic-colored plastic, not metal like one might assume just from looking at the pictures of it online.2. It does not feel extremely sturdy.I have been using a rolling pin to get my dough almost as thin as the ""0"" setting before I roll it out with the machine. This way, the motor isn't getting stressed to it's maximum capacity -- it sounds like it is struggling if you push the dough through as thick as you would when using the manual crank, which is to say, just patted out with your hands. Frankly, I wish this thing were made with all metal parts, especially as it is so expensive."
2,plastic gears break,I have been making pasta for many years and about 4 years ago I decided to treat myself to a motor for my Atlas machine which was only a few months old at the time (older machine went to grandkids for clay). Needless to say the 3 year warranty is up and last night I was making noodles and the large plastic gear inside the motor broke. I don't use it often so certainly expected a lot more use out of it. Beware....it can happen to you
5,Works like a charm,The motor works great on the older Atlas Pasta Machine as long as you buy the adapter plate. Easy to use and install. My husband loves it.
4,"Not what I expected, but still good.","This is a solid 4.5 star movie, imo. The plot flows in a straight forward way with some exceptional scenes and how it unfolds makes sense. The only failing is there's no training or preparation for the assassin. Though the character matures somewhat in a haphazard and lucky fashion, she's still an amateur and reacts more than she thinks.It's a decent movie."
4,Potential to be better,"A reasonably good drama/thriller that focuses on the lives of two women enduring a depressing and difficult existence albeit in very different circumstances. The film concentrates on their developing relationship highlighting the human weakness in both as events unfold. The grim and bleak prospects they face and endure are effectively portrayed throughout with a number of violent scenes in which they suffer at the hands of the men in their lives. The story line is believable enough but in my view the ending which, in their circumstances, is inevitable deserves a rather more realistic treatment. It suspended belief just a little too far and took something away from a movie that had the potential to be a little more thought provoking. Nonetheless, a watchable and entertaining offering with good performances from the main characters."
1,Don't Even Consider it!,"First, according to the information on amazon.com's web site, the language of this movie is in English. Then, on the case, the language states 'English'. And when you go to the set up menu, the options are for English 5.0, and English 2.0.The 6 previews of other movies were all in English, but sitting through 30 to 40 minutes of this movie I didn't hear one word of English. Had English sub-titles, but I want to watch a movie, not read it.Don't even know what language they were even speaking, but it wasn't English. Didn't bother even finishing watching the movie, returned it for a refund."
3,Illogical,"Moving story but illogical. All that gun play and never, not once, a policeman in sight. Evidently, in Tel-Aviv you can kill people at will and never get caught or even tracked. No one calls the police; even the airport security is absent. So, as long as you can accept this, the acting was superb."
2,poor movie,First off it was captioned which is ok if the movie has a good plot. The acting was terible and didn't make a lot of sence to me.
2,Took forever to get anywhere with the plot,"The Assassin next door seemed to take forever to get anywhere with the plot and once it got there, there just wasn't much going for it. Meh."
1,Boring Boring Boring,"Olga Kuryenko is one of my favorite actresses, unfortunately not even she could save this movie. The acting was bad, every guy in it is portrayed as a sadistic with no redeeming qualities. The worse part is the Pacing is Terribly slow. I have seen paint dry that at times seemed more exciting than scenes in this movie. I wish there was a 0 star rating,but I am forced to give it at least 1. Don't waste your time, it's precious life wasted that you will never get back."
1,horrible movie,"horrible movie, it started slow, the story unfolded horribly the action in it was weak, unless you want to waste both your time and your money, you should skip this one..."
4,Attractive watch for business or casual wear,"This watch by Timex is a very nice-looking, easy-to-wear accessory. It has a distinctive light blue, pearly face and unique open-weave rectangular links with a slight curve to them. Although described as a dress watch, it works well as a chic everyday alternative too. It has no numbers and is marked only at the quarter hours; like all watches of this style, it is slightly difficult to read. Also, although the product features above note the the links are easy to adjust, when I took this watch to Walmart, they were unable to remove the links due to their unusual curved form (I haven't yet tried taking the watch to a jeweler). Overall, I'm pleased with this watch; it's a great fashion accessory at a very affordable price."
1,Poor at best !!,This product is too expensive for the little it does. It is a lame duck compared to Webroot Spy Sweeper. Ultra wincleaner one click is a far better product.

5,This is a Wonderful Series,"This is like pure entertainment with some education thrown in, comedy, splash of drama, and when he tries to be all serious, he don't make it, the body language of the females that assists him through out the series could supply a college course in none verbal communication for a good 4 years...lol At the end of the season one DVDs there is a little interview with him. He talks about all the medical issues from constant travel to strange lands, but now watch him, he is a true Barron scientist! watch him taste salt from the dead sea, and taste sulfur from the desert and he is always like a child exploring the world with all his senses you can't help but love his innocence..lol"
2,Not worth it!,I am sorry to say that this book was not all it was cracked up to be. The summary sounded great and at first it was fine but then it started to go down hill. Some might find this book enjoyable but I didn't.
4,the kids love it,"I bought this for my nephew (age 5)- he and his sister (age 8) both love it. It's a bit different than many of the flashy, fast paced games available now (my sister described it as folksy) but it makes the kids think and is entertaining. It has worked pretty well on their Mac, although there has been a couple times when the screen has gone blue- can't see the picture but can hear what's going on. On those occasions my sister had to restart the computer."
4,Indiana Jones and the Dungeons of Toledo,"Waking up in darkness, fearing a live burial; groping in the darkness almost falling into a pit; bound to a framework under a swinging pendulum while rats rush for their midnight snack; sizzling iron walls squeezing together, but not to cook hamburgers. These could be scenes from Indiana Jones and the Dungeons of Toledo. And yet, The Pit and the Pendulum is classic Poe: heart throbbing, adrenaline rushing, spine tinkling and hair raising suspense and terror. The story triumphs not only through its content but also its form; the words and sentences, like spectral needles and blades, pierce memory and imagination to engrave a tangy nightmare. Yes, before Stephen King, there was Edgar Allan Poe. Bon appetite!"
2,Not the best print quality,I am sure all the words are in there but low quality print. They make it look like a penguin classic but don't be mistaken.
