2,won't stay in my ear,"I suppose everyone's ears are different but these won't stay in my ear. The slightest tug and out they come. Almost useless. Too bad because they were comfortable and the sound quality seemed pretty good. But if they fall out, What's the point?"
1,i never received these earphones,I am so sad to say i never received these earphones. I am still waiting for them.I wanted these for my little girl to use in her tape player. Please send them to me. thank you.
2,Okay for the price,"Sound quality is okay-nothing that's going to blow your mind. It's like 6 dollars so it's not like I was expecting much.If there's one thing I really like about these, it's that they're extremely comfortable. I can wear them and not really notice them, so that's really great. It comes with 3 different sizes of rubber ear tips, so you're should be able find one that fits you.However, these aren't very durable-the wiring next to the connector already broke after ~2 weeks of usage. JLab used to have great customer service with a hassle free warranty, but now they make you return it after it breaks, and the shipping to return this back will cost almost as much as buying a new pair, so why bother.I really wanted to like these headphones, but breaking after only 2 weeks of regular use is a true disappointment."
3,Mediocre,"Okay pair of headphones for the price, fit was not very secure nor was there volume controls on the cord. Sound was hollow, sounded as if was playing music off in the distance"
4,Love the long cord,"I purposely searched for a pair of earbuds with a longer cord so that they could be plugged in to my computer and still give my head a long enough tether to move around a bit. The sound quality is not amazing, but for the price, they work well enough!"
1,Junk,Broke in less than 2 weeks...audio in only one earbud. Previous earbuds under same kind of use lasted 2 years.
4,Inexpensive and good value,I'm always losing or breaking my earbuds so I've made the decision to get one quasi expensive pair ($70-$150) and several inexpensive pairs. The sound with these is good. They sound better than one of my $30 sets. I can freely use them going to work or hanging out with friends after work when I go out on the town for a few hours without fear of loss or damage.
1,They didn't work,They never worked properly! Completely unsatisfied with the product. And returning them has become more trouble than it's worth. Jlab is generally better than this in my experience.
4,Inexpensive earbuds,I just wanted something temporarily until I could afford a nice pair. These were pretty much what I expected. Nothing fancy. They just pretty much do the job.
3,heidi,I dont know if I got a defective pair mine did not play sound out of both ear buds. So I ordered another brand and gave those 5 stars
4,Very Nice for the Price,"Good sound, blocks out alot of exterior noise. Only wish it had a volume control on it instead of reaching for device to adjust volume. But maybe that would make it cost double?"
2,Great until....,"These ear buds were pretty good. Good sound, comfortable, did a decent job at noise cancellation, up until they break down. I had two pairs that broke down on me, some kind of problem with the connection near the jack. I'm switching."
3,First pair was great. Second pair sound horrible,"I ordered a pair 3 months ago and they were great. They came in black plastic packaging.I recently ordered the same exact pair that came in a silver and white package. My god, the new pair is horrible. There is a huge difference in sound quality between the two. The one from the white package sounds muffled while the ear buds from the black packaging are clear/crisp.There is a noticeable difference between the two pairs despite being the same color.I will do a burn in and see if that is the problem. JLab's claims process seems pretty easy so far. I'll update later on how it goes."
3,kinda crappy,"Kinda crappy, the light blue bits are kinda large, even for my larger ears, but good enough to keep by my bed for late-night youtube watching so I don't wake up my roommate."
3,functional,"The ear-buds do their job, and the sound quality meets the expectations considering the price. It's good value and affordable."
4,Great Sound for the Money,"I have come to learn that regardless of price, one will go through at least two pairs of ear buds per year if you're using them on a regular basis for working out. IMO, jbuds fit great, sound great, are durable. For the price you can't beat them."
1,JBuds failure,"I bought these ear buds new from amazon.com, but when I got them, the sound quality was horrible. I don't know what the problem was, if it was manufacturing or shipping, but the sound quality was just horrible. Sometimes, I couldn't even hear the lyrics, and the sound kept on fluctuating. I returned them."
3,Good value for money,"The sound is a bit lacking in the bass area, and it doesnt stopnoise very well, but for $8.45 it was a pretty good deal.The cord is nice and long, and the silicon pieces fit well enough.Realistically, I don't think they're worth $50, but if you justwant to listen to music and aren't too picky, theseare just fine earbuds. Nothing great, but nothing very bad,either. Overall, decent earbuds."
1,poor quality,This product and case are of poor quality and I would not recommend them for purchase. Wire is cheap and there is no noise reduction.
1,Terrible - does not fit,"These are terrible earbuds. Even though they come with 3 different size covers, none of these options will make these stay in my ears for any more time than it takes to move my hands from my ears back to my side. It is extremely frustrating, and I have given up. Walking with these earbuds in -- forget it! They will not stay in. Sound quality does not matter at all if the earbuds will not even stay in your ears and you have to keep fumbling with them."
5,Bang for your buck,I did not expect these ear phones to be that great judging by the price but I was wrong. They sound great for ear phones this size.
3,"A decent value, but nothing impressive","Best thing I can say is they sound ok, are light weight, and didn't cost much. But, I don't really think they sound any better than my original Ipod buds."
2,"Does Not Last Long, Waste of Money","I bought this product a month ago, the left earbud already failed. I'm glad that I didn't' review this product right away; if I did then I would have gave it 5 stars. It is a good product, it fits comfortably, but it's a disappointing product because it failed on one of the ear buds too quickly.... NOT COOL..."
2,Why so many people like this thing ?,"Bought this ear buds because of so many good reviews, just got it today and I did a comparison with a headphone then I realized right away the big difference: for the ear buds, the music base is nearly gone. Good part is wearing is more comfortable than many other ear plugs. Would not have bought this had I known all this. Amazon delivery, like always, is great."
4,"Affordable, good quality buds","I bought these because I'm broke and I'm tired of the ipod ear buds falling from my ears.1) These have stayed in my ears while running, walking around, house work/chores.2) The sound quality is good for music and I don't have to turn up the volume very much because they drown out most of the sound.3) Comes with 4 different-sized flexible and soft attachments to accommodate different ear sizes.4) So far the only con for me is the ease of losing the attachments. They haven't fallen off the ear bud yet because I'm trying to take care of these, but the attachments are easy to remove or lose, especially if you tend to throw them in your bag or purse, which is why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars.It's worth the buy for those looking for something simple and practical. You can find better noise-reducing buds and probably better sound quality, but you'll pay alot more."
1,Sounded great while they lasted.,"The sound quality for these earphones is solid given the price. They do block out a decent amount of ambient noise and they have a rich sound quality.Unfortunately, after 3 months one of the earphones stopped working. Days later, the other stopped. The company did not respond to requests for replacement earphones. It's too bad because they are definitely a decent product but it's more like renting them then buying them if they're not going to last."
4,Good for the price,"Sound quality is a little better than I expected for a $20 pair of headphones, noise reduction isn't that great, but its there. Comes with 2 additional sizes of ear pieces, small and large. Music seems to lose some of its treble as well, but overall sound quality makes up for it. Bottom line, if you are looking for a decent cheap pair of ear buds, this is it."
1,They don't last long.,This is my second pair of these. The first pair was replaced. Both pairs died after 3-4 months. All other aspects of the headphones are good. They are a great price if you don't expect them to last too long.
5,Small but Powerful,"I love my iPod nano but the headphones it came with are AWEFUL. And I was considering buying the noise cancellation BOSE mobile headset but I thought I give these guys a try first (especially at such a good price point). I'm SO glad I did, the quality is great and there perfect while driving around my old Jeep."
3,gets the job done,the headphones are okay for what the price is but they fall out of your ear all the time and aren't the most comfortable but they get the job done.
1,Right bud sucks and still waiting for reply!!,"Since my last review didn't get posted AND I haven't gotten a response from JLabAudio, I'm going to write another bad review. So, the earphone came with one side noticeably ""poorer quality"" than the other side. As in, when you turn the volume all the way up, one side crackles. And, there is a very noticeable volume difference between the two earphones (at all volumes). I hoped the earphones would improve after the ""burn-in"" period. It didn't. I emailed info@jLabaudio and service@jLabaudio, but they haven't responded yet. I believe it is more than a week now (or maybe even more). That goes against what they posted on their website: ""A customer service representative will respond within one business day or sooner""."
3,BUDS,"this product was not the best, but it does reduce a little noise. i wouldn't really recommend these much."
2,Meeehh...,"So yeah i bought these earbuds to replace the ones that came with my iPod touch after reading what seemed to be mostly positive reviews. When I got it however, I guess i got what i paid for. At 10 dollars these earbuds are not very good at all... I did a comparison between these and my regular ipod earphones and i have to say that the sound quality was equivalent if not worse than that of the apple earphones. Yes i did push them all the way into my ear canal and still the sound wasn't very good. They did not fit in my ear that well even with the different sizes. These didn't seem very well made either imho... kinda cheap materials but then again i guess i got what i paid for."
2,I wanted to like them...,"I received these earbuds yesterday, and immediately began the recommended 24-hour burn-in process. I snuck a quick listen a couple of times, and was concerned that the right earbud sounded great, but the left sounded distant and tinny. I hoped that after burning in it would improve.24 hours have now passed, and although they have improved somewhat, there is still a noticeable difference between the two sides. I feel like I am listening to the left side through cotton.I wanted to like them, but unfortunately they will be going back."
1,One Bud Failure Not a Fluke!,"You'd think after reading the many complaints about one of the earbuds giving out after a while of use, I'd have went for another product. But the price was so low that I figured I'd buy two, in case one malfunctioned. Both malfuctioned. The first after 4 weeks, the second just 3 weeks. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, you can find the same quality product in a drugstore, and you don't have to wait or pay for shipping."
1,Low grade product in all regards.,These are terribly poor headphones. Mine lasted three weeks before an earpiece went dead. I would say it lasted for about thirty hours of use at the most.The sound quality was average. Slightly better then the panasonic's around this price but the point is moot when the product dies almost immediately.I suggest avoiding these even at 10$. They are just not worth it. There are far better products out there.
1,"Break Easily, But Good Customer Service Replaced Them","My pair broke in less than three weeks. When I said so on a review on Amazon, an apparently automated message tried to convince me that this was an isolated incident (which it isn't; look at the other 1 star reviews) and told me to contact customer support, who would be happy to resolve this issue and give a replacement pair. I sent an email, waited several weeks, sent another email, waited several weeks. Still no reply. Don't buy from this company. The headphones have a high likelihood of breaking, and if they do, it is impossible to contact customer support anyways.UPDATE 9/12/09: Apparently they had problems with their customer service person not answering any emails sent to him. I appears have have resolved this, and I received a replacement pair, and a free carrying case. This was very nice of them. I cant change the star rating to reflect this, though."
3,Not very long-lasting,"Within a couple months, the earphones stopped playing in one ear. I bought a new pair; this time, it cut out in one ear after only 2-3 weeks. They would probably have a longer life if the user were very careful with the earphones, keeping them in a velvet-lined box, but come on: these are MP3 player earbuds. They should be able to withstand some wear and tear."
4,awesome for my freakishly small ears,"these earbuds fit perfectly in my tiny ear canals, they don't hurt like most others. They deliver a great clean sound. Not so noise reducing, I can still hear traffic and conversation when working out, but its not distracting. I am so happy I found these earbuds."
1,VERY BAD QUALITY!,I bought these as an extra to have lying around and was VERY disappointed at the quality. I wasn't expecting much for the price but the sound quality for these is VERY POOR! I plugged them into my MP3 player which was set at the volume that I like and sounds great on my Skullcandy earbuds but these sounded distorted and the bass was near nonexistant. I will stick to Skullcandy in the future....
2,Not Recommended,"It sounded fine until I compared it to my Sony regular earphones that I picked up for $9.99 at Walmart.These earbuds give a hissing noise in rock songs with high base. Not as loud as my sony ones for the same volume level...the only good thing is the cord is longer.It appears that there is nothing done from their part about noise reduction, its just that it goes in your ear so background noise is reduced anyway.The magnet is a cobalt magnet, whereas it is neodymium in virtually all other earphones...."
2,Not so Hi-Fi Ear Buds,Bought it for $9.99 any more than that NOT worth the money. Manufacturer Suggested price of $29.99 would be a rip-off.
1,Not worth the money,I bought them for noise reduction not quality of sound and they dont do it. Might just as well buy the 99 cent ones
2,Great until they break!,"Many other well written bits. Good sound quality, broke within 3 months. ordered in May, it is now July 28th and i need new headphones."
1,one of ear has no sound after less than 2 weeks,"We bought a pair, but one of its ear has no sound now just after 2 weeks of use."
2,"got static after 2 months, doesn't fit very well, feels cheap","got static after 2 months, doesn't fit very well, feels cheap. got another pair from Bestbuy for $9.99 and fit so much better"
2,Good but very very fragile!!!!,"Hello,I'm going to sum this up very quickly. These headphones have one of the best sound qualities ever and is extremely great at noise reduction because it blocks out all other sounds. HOWEVER, if you are a jogger like me these pieces of c***p will break on you in 3 months or less. I bought 2 pairs in a span of 3 months and I stopped using this brand because of this problem. I called the company and they told me that due to my jogging the excess stress on the cords (bumping up and down)and the excess moisture (the sweat in my ears) were user made damages and thus cannot be covered and apologize for such a short lifespan. Really great huh? So use this if you only listen to music on the road or walking places but if you want to listen to music at the gym or jogging I suggest SONY headphones. They might have less sound quality but at least they last you well over an entire year."
1,The customer service never gets back to you...,"These earbuds lasted only about 7 months before the wires started separating and one earbud lost sound. Jlab says they have a one-year warranty on their products, but what good does a one-year warranty do if they never get back to you? I left about 3 voicemails and emailed 3 times explaining that their product had failed within one year of purchase, and they never got back to me. Funny how no one ever picked up the phone when I called too - always went to voicemail. Don't buy from Jlab."
4,better than Apple standard issue.,"Standard earbuds do not stay in MY ears. These have three different size rubber covers, and are shaped better for me."
2,Not hardly a year,"I am shopping for a new pair of earphones as the one that I bought like these went out and I now can only listen to one side, the right side. Yesteday it started skipping even on that side and I have jiggle it and finally got it to where it was working again and placed a piece of cellotape to hols it in place! Annoying. I hope for more. I have less!"
2,"Comfy, but lousy sound.","Its a nice price but the sound quality is lousy. It feels like a lot of the sound gets lost in the rubber cushioning of the headphones. The shape of the earbuds even creates more air flow rushing through your ears if you're running or riding a bike, which means more noise. I'd return them if they weren't just $10. As it is I'll keep them as an emergency pair."
2,Not an Upgrade to me...,"I bought these to upgrade from what came stock with the Zune player. I compared the sound, volume, bass etc. and did not hear much difference at all. I returned and went with a slightly more expensive model."
3,"pretty good, not great","I was hoping that these would block out ambient noise, e.g. at the gym. They do OK but not great. Plus, they are difficult to get into my ears. I must push and twist really hard to get them in right - kind of painful. I suppose I have to shell out 50-60 bucks to get real sound-blocking."
2,noise reduction??,I didn't think these did so well on noise reduction. The cheap pair I bought at another store worked better than these. Don't buy them if they aren't cheap.
2,Fit Problems,"I bought this earphones after reading so many good reviews about it considering its price. But when I got it, it didn't fit my ears at all. It kept falling off and the sound quality wasn't good either."
2,not so great for me,"bought these because of the low price and great reviews - but these do NOT stay in my ears no matter what. I have tried all 3 sizes, looped the cord around the top of my ear, etc.... - actually - I have never owned any buds that fell out so much. Even the cheap ones Apple includes with their products.Waste of money for me - but if you can get them to stay in - they sound pretty good for the price."
4,Good sound and comfort for the price,"I picked these up to replace a $30 pair of Sony earbuds that finally went dead on me. I didn't have much to justifiably spend on a new set of earbuds, and I have a quality pair of studio headphones for when I'm home, so I decided to give the JBuds a try. I am pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and the comfortable fit. Certainly, these can't compare with earbuds priced $30 and up, but for $10 they are really quite wonderful and absolutely they sound better than the earbuds that come standard with iPods or most other music devices. There's a richness of sound to the JBuds, and though the bass frequency isn't its strongest attribute, these little buds get some quality thumping happening in your ear canals. I also appreciated the minimalist packaging, to reduce waste (why aren't all companies doing this yet?). If you are looking for an inexpensive pair of earbuds that are comfortable and provide a clear sound, these are a good choice."
2,Wiring Went Bad,"I bought a pair to use while I ride, however within 3 weeks, the left ear bud wire came out so I just threw them away. Cheap for a reason....."
3,Fair - You get what you pay for,"Good: It's cheap and very confortable (specially because it comes with 3 different sizes rubber covers). Since you can choose the rubber which better adapts to your ears, besides being confortable it also provides some isolation.Bad: It's really nothing more than that. It's 19 bucks headphone and this is exactly what you get, nothing more. It's very fragile, the sound is regular (nothing really special) and the ""Noise Reducing"" is solely due to mechanical isolation."
1,uncomfortable - poor design,"If you like putting rocks in your ears, you will love these. In ear buds should squish softly into the ear and make a snug fit, but the hard plastic body is so large, these don't squish at all. I have three other cheap brands of ear buds this size and they are all more comfortable than these. I tried to get used to these, but after suffering a couple days with these, they went strait to the trash bin."
1,Lost an ear-bud,"The headphones worked well while they lasted, I particularly liked how they blocked out outside noises better than the ones that came with my ipod. But after about 2 weeks, the right earbud is significantly quieter than the left, basically to the point that it doesn't work anymore. That is a ridiculously short life span. Maybe if I only had one ear..."
4,Not bad [heavy use in gym],"I purchased this product early February & I'm writing this review early October. I am now having trouble with the wiring where I have to play with the wires to try and get one of the headphones to work. Now, I've been using this 3-4 times a week IN THE GYM. I'd say that the lifespan on these headphones aren't too bad for the cheap price tag. Note that I sweat very easily and would do ALL my workout with iPod/headphones on. I'd definitely buy these again for gym purposes."
5,nice,really dose what it says it will do noise reducing awesome product fits my phone too. I get a crisp sound with it
4,Excellent earphones,"These stay in my ears, I don't have to turn my mp3 player up as loud when I use these. They come with 3 different size rubber covers and that has made a big difference in comfort for me. The rubber covers weren't easy to get on but they are worth it! I have great sound now."
5,They Deserve 6 Stars,"These are the best ear buds that can be had for less than $100. I haven't tried more expensive ear buds, so that's all I can comment on. They blow those crappy, overpriced skull candy ear buds out of the water. When you get a good seal on these buds, they produce really tasty sounds from very low to very high. The bass response is very deep and tight. The highs are very crisp. The mids are very true. The instructions tell you to play them loudly for a day or so for them to break in. Follow the instructions, because the bass really opens up after you break them in. I plugged them into my home stereo and cranked them much louder than I would be able to stand them in my ears. I put the ear bud ends in a shoe box and closed it so I wouldn't hear them all over the room. After the break in, I was floored by the sound."
3,"not a great product compared to alternatives, but not bad","Product is inferior in sound quality and bass level for its price to competing products, but not the worst on market. I would recommend for potential buyers to instead get the Skullcandy earbuds-- cheap ones lie around $8, and have AMAZING sound quality and bass for earbuds of its price range. These aren't quite as good."
1,lasted 2 months,They were fine until after 3 months they stopped working! The sound was good they just started to short out! I didnt even use them all that much! Dont waste your time i went to radio shack and got a pair covered for a year!
4,Excellent Headphones,Especially for the price these headphones are great and reliable. Fast shipping also. I can imagine the quality of the more expensive ones should be very good. However these are sufficient for me.
2,dissapointed,"really fast shipping.....but, just popped these bad boys in and I was kind of surprised at the ""can"" sound quality of these headphones! Im not sure if i got a bad set or what but i am very dissapointed, my jvc marsh mellow headphones sound better then these, I also ordered Panasonic rp-hje120-k headphones for 6 bucks that sound more clear then these, i just tried these two out as soon as I received them with the same settings on my mp3 player.... Im really confused because of all the positive reviews...im returning these."
3,Not the greatest!,"Although I find the headphones very comfortable, the max volume on them is not very loud. I was a little disappointed because of this. The sound quality of them however is nice, once again just not very loud at all. They are cute though, and come in nice colors. My opinion? A little over priced. I honestly could've purchased a cheaper brand, that I know work excellent - but i decided to try these out. If you like your headphones to deliver extremely loud sound/music...keep looking! But if you enjoy headphones that aren't too loud, but still sound good, these are the perfect ones for you."
2,Didn't work for long.,"I bought a set of these for myself and my husband. Mine lasted about six months before they stopped working. Fumbling with the cord where it plugs in makes the sound come on and off. My husband's only worked 3 times before the same thing happened. The sound quality was good, but I they should be more durable."
5,pink ear buds,"Very comfortable,great price,long cord, love the pink Color, went perfect.with my case I bought with it. Both for twenty dollars cant beat it"
1,ALERT!!!!A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!\DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,I purchased this earpiece and received pakage on 12/1 and by 12/4 it no longer works. Two days use and it is now of no use. I am totally furious and I want my money back.
1,Not for me,"guys, i bought these headphones recently and thought dat i would get a good pair of headphones, i was really wrong. since i read a lot of good reviews, i thought it was a wise decision to buy them. i really dunno what happened, cuz da pair i received, new from the package, they didnt work right. the right headphone did not work at all, i tried playing them with different devices and at different volumes but none made it work.i really dunno wats wrong with these guys... how could they send sth broken directly from the package?i would suggest u buy sth else"
1,Can get better for cheaper,"The ""jelly"" buds are pretty uncomfortable. Also, they broke after 1 use. Haven't dealt with the return process yet...."
4,Worked great for 6 months,"I use these every day, for many hours at work and on my commute. They cancel outside noise very well. But after 6 months they are starting to fail. Wish they would last longer as I like this product."
1,You get what you pay for.,I bought these trying to switch up from always buy Skull Candy headphones. Not to mention these were cheaper at the time. However after opening these I realized how flat and diminished the sound quality was. I figured well Ill burn them in. They really didnt get better. Now Im off to buy other ear phones to replace these.
1,they just dont work,"Hi,well, they worked for about 4 weeks and then : 1. the left earphone had a small noise and it grew.... now, you can barely hear on the left side.2. when i plug them into the computer and unplug, the pc ( 2 pc's actually and a mac) ""think"" they are still plugged in.....not worth the moneynot worth the trouble"
1,The reviews are accurate -- these are very poor quality.,"Worked great... FOR TWO MONTHS! I didn't believe the negative reviews and thought, ""oh they're cheap, it's worth a try"". Learn from my mistake. The internal wiring is failing already after two months, and they have suffered no misuse or trauma in my care; they are just poor quality. NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,They break!,I did not carefully look at all the negative reviews thinking that most negative reviewers would be audiophiles and I am not. I was looking for a cheap pair of earhpones for my Ipod to listen to pocasts.The buds stopped working in less than two weeks. One buds crackles in and out while the other bud produces no sound. Don't buy these!
4,"OK, but not comfortable to wear for an extended period","I tried these ear buds as a substitute for the iPod earbuds hoping they were more comfortable and provided the same or better quality sound. However, I had trouble keeping them in my ears long enough to assess sound quality. If I pushed them in farther to make them stay, I found them uncomfortable."
1,"Fragile, broke within one month, sound only in one earbud","These sounded ok/fine but broke within one month. Very fragile, piece of junk. Don't waste your money on these cheap jbuds, get something more reliable, such as the Creative EP-630. They are way better and only about $10 more."
4,Nice,"Honestly, I have purchased so many ear buds but this one is extraordinary. it just perfect. It feels like there is no noise at the background when I have the JBuds in my ear. I can feel the music"
3,Like them but...,"The sound is great if only the buds stay in place. Though it comes with 3 bud sizes I still am not comfortable with them as thay just fall out. Perhaps its me and not the product,,,whatever..its still annoying."
2,You get what you pay for,The sound quality is sub par compared to my 5 year old headphones. They also are rather uncomfortable to wear. I actually found removing the rubber ends more comfortable than any of the 3 sizes they offered.For 20 bucks they will do their job though but I wouldn't recommend them.
3,You Get What You Pay For - Flat & Muddy Sound,"For $17, these are a solid, but middling performer. The sound is kinda flat and muddy (insufficient high frequency, which diminishes intelligibility for voice podcasts -- my primary use). This style provides some passive reduction of external noise because the soft silicone adapters fit inside the ear entrance. But as soon as the price drops on the Apple M9394G in-ear headphones (similar design, but much brighter and clearer sound) back into the reasonable range (below $30), I'll buy another set of those (the dog ate my previous pair!) These JBuds' flat response might sound OK to some ears for music, but not for voice ranges or high frequency response."
1,Works very limited time.,"It makes a great sound but works only for 3 months. After 3 months, the left side of the earbud quit working completely. Cheep for a reason."
1,Unreliable,"I purchased 2 sets of these earbuds, one for myself and one for my roommate. Both of us had the same problem with the right bud completely dying out. Not cool"
1,The sound is terrible - do not ignore the negative reviews like I did,"I still have the white buds that came with my shuffle, and switching to these is a jarring experience. The JBuds sound muddy: just plain bad. They fit fine, and I might use them at the gym where I am not listening closely to the music and the little bit of noise reduction helps. The sound is so bad that even when I listen to books on tape I notice the low quality. I highly recommend spending a few bucks more and buying the comparable Sony product. I have used these and they have the noise reduction but also have decent sound quality."
1,"OK at first, but now they are trash...","I got these for Christmas and initially liked them as they were more comfortable than the ear buds that came with the iPod, however, I noticed a couple of problems. First, the rubber tips come off very easily, second, after about two months there was static in the right ear piece at times, and finally, after six months the right ear piece quit working completely and I had to throw them away. The problem may be linked to the very thin wire used so my next pair of ear buds will definitely be much more substantial."
2,Disappointed!!,So I'm going to make this short and sweet (or not so much sweet). I've been looking for some good quality headphones for a while since mine went out a while back. I ordered these...got them within two days..okay awesome. I tried them out...sound quality was really good for the price they were..AWESOME. THREE DAYS LATER...both earbuds went out..wtf? I would start messing with the wire right where it plugs into anything and I would get sound...then it would go out again. Highly disappointed considering that the quality of the sound was so good. Guess cheaper is not ALWAYS better. :/
4,Work well on airplane.,I finally got a chance to use these on an airplane and they worked fine. I wasn't expecting to get absolute removal of extraneous noises but it was better than I expected for earbubs in that price range. I could hear the sound on the airplane sound system quite clearly without having to crank up the volume. There weren't any screaming babies on the flight so I don't know yet if that sound will be reduced but I'm pleased so far with my purchase. I use them sometimes to listen to music or other stuff as I go to sleep and I find that they are fairly comfortable possibly because they have a lower profile and they don't get shoved further in my ears as I lie on the pillow. The quality of manufacture seems quite good too. I gave a 4 star rating only because I haven't tried them in all situations yet. I would recommend these for purchase.
4,IMPECCABLE SOUND!!,Usually you have to break them in playing music 5 hrs each day until they reach their optimum level. (yes you can do this without listening for 5 hrs lol) But it's not even that long yet. I just received them today and they sound fantastic! You rather turn them upside down to avoid them from falling out then tuck the wire behind your ears. It is also good to do so for that great noise isolating sound. Just you and your music! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH....PROS: 3 extra ear buds provided! Register your product for a 1 year warranty online!CON: earbuds not as silicony and thick as Skull Candy buds.They are rather thin.Not bad for the price!
3,Perfect for the price,"I read somewhere these are good for small ears. They come with white plastic pieces of different sizes-- the smallest worked best for me. Hallelujah! I was so tired of searching for something affordable but comfortable. I mean they aren't perfect-- sometimes I have to push them back in, but I don't mind, especially for that price. And I don't care much for this feature, but I think they do decrease background noise.Update: I've had them for 6 months and the right earphone doesn't work anymore, unless I hold it a specific way, which of course is impossible running. It's really disappointing that I have to buy new headphones now."
5,Great little earphones,These earphones are very comfortable and produce some great sound. The music is very clear and blocks out quite a bit of outside noise.
4,"c'mon, it's only twenty clams","much more comfortable than the in-ear headphones i was using (sennheisers); which made a twelve hour train ride excruciatingly painful. these are astoundingly comfortable compared to the senn's, and in the right conditions they sound pretty good. they're no $1000 Grado cans, for sure, but they fit and they're well worth twenty bucks. not much nuance to these, but, seriously, i'm listening to compressed garage punk on an mp3 player on public transit... you won't find a better bargain than these.(update) well, i've listened to several hundred hours on these and am still quite happy. they've held up well, still sound good, still work just like the day i got 'em. so go get yours now!"
4,Worked Perfectly Just needed a thicker cord,I purchased these Ear Buds two weeks ago and used them everyday without any problems. I was uneasy with this style since my Sony ones in this style couldn't hold the rubber ends. With these I never had an issue with comfort or sound quality/volume. I could keep the Ear Buds in for hours without any discomfort. I also could listen to the same songs on my Ipod at less than half the previous listened to volume because of their quality.The only reason I took one star off is because my cat just chewed through the cord. I never had this issue with any of my previous head phones. These don't have the same protective coatings as my old Sony ones. However because of the sound quality achieved I don't blame them for not having a thicker cord. I just know for next time to keep them away from my cat.
2,Not so good...I promise,"I bought these in-ear earbuds as a replacement for my Sandisk E130 earbuds, hoping that they would provide the same comfort and sound. Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $20. The sound is high-pitched and the sound-blocking ability is virtually absent, two of the main reasons somebody would want to have in ear earbds. Try something else."
1,My free airplane buds sound much better!,"First of all a feel scammed. Buds with frequency range 20 Hz - 20 kHz usually cost no more than $5 at your local grocery store. My free airplane buds actually have more range (20Hz-22kHz). Also the description of these buds and ""Noise Canceling"" is dishonest. Only the electronic noise cancellation devices can claim that. The soft silicone which supposed to block out the noise does no such thing. It is way too thin. I can hear equally well with them in or out. I would only recommend these buds to people who have a problem with regular buds falling out of their ears and have some hearing problems on top of that. Anyway don't pay more than $5 for these, they are not worth it."
2,Not as good as reviewed.,"Don't believe the hype. If you are looking for clear crisp bass and sound isolating, pay a little more because these are just as good as any ear buds you might get at the dollar store."
1,Worthless ....,It stopped working after one month .... First the right side did not work .... then both of them ... Might look cheap .... but no point in buying this ... I do not recommend it ...
4,"Good solid headphones, not mind blowing","I bought these and also bought Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones- considering the Cobys were only $5, I think they were a better deal. These are great headphones, don't get me wrong, but I think the Cobys were a better deal and similar quality."
4,Great for the price!,"I am generally very lazy to write reviews about products I use, but I thought this one deserved it!In the beginning, it sounded like a very ordinary earbuds and to be frank i kind of regretted my decision of not buying a little more expensive one with better value for money. But now, after its been a month using them these earbuds have really begun to open up!The sound quality has suddenly got much much better with very good bass and music detail for its price. So its definitely a 5 star on value for money.Only problem is the noise reduction, which i feel is way below par as compared to earbuds from creative (Just twice the price though). Not a lot, but still you CAN listen to noises outside that are LOUD. It is OK reducing the not so loud ones.In short, a very good buy for the price. Nothing to regret much. But if I am a new buyer, I think i would still pay a little extra and go for something like creative majorly because of its noise reduction capabilities.Cheers!"
4,You get what you pay for,"It's a decent pair of ear buds, but don't expect anything super special. For 20 bucks you'll get a 20 worth of ear buds."
1,Fine -- until they die three months in,"As someone who uses ear buds/earphones almost solely for the commute to work and to workout, I was more than happy with the earphones that originally came with my iPod. When those gave out after two-plus years of use, I purchased the JBuds hoping for nothing more than the durability of the previous pair - I was not searching for anything extraordinary in regards to audio. They were more than useful - good fit, good sound - until about three months of use when, first, the right bud began to give out, and then about a week later, the left also died. It would be a nice product if it lasted, but just three months is ridiculous. I've noticed that others have voiced similar problems, so please consider this when making a purchase."
4,Good Sound for the price,These are great for the price. I have some JVC ear buds that just wore out but the cables had some kind of coating on them and they never tangled in my gym bag. It isn't a show stopper but I wish these had that coating.
3,Lasted 6 Months,"I bought the JBUDS headphones in October 2007 after researching on Amazon. I used them just about everyday since I bought them. The headphones were working fine, but then one of the headphones went out on me. Now, the one headphone goes in and out and is very annoying. So, they lasted me six months of heavy use. I'm going to buy a bit more expensive headphones now, and I hope they are more durable than the JBUDS. Just another example of you get what you pay for!"
4,Effective and Inexpensive,"These ear buds fit right into your ears like fitted ear plugs; thus reducing the ambient noise. Although the silicon tips look durable, I am not sure how long they will last, but I've started to look for the medium size replacement tips."
2,Not the best quality for the price,"I bought these to replace the earbuds that came with my ipod. The quality of the sound was not as good although the noise canceling properties were slightly better. In general, I found that the sound came through less crisp and clear and a little bass heavy. I think you can get something better for the same price."
2,dont buy,"so, like others, i was contemplating what buds to buy and reading all the reviews. I would say now that i am the person who you read the review and think, ""maybe he just has high standards for such a cheap product?"" I didnt have high standards for the head phones bc i buy cheap headphones all the time. the sound was about 1/2 rate of my orig. sansa disc headphones. comfort great, but the cord was too long, and it did not have a good solid cord. i would buy another brand, or higher quality for the extra bucks."
2,Horrible Fit,"I do not like the product, it won't stay in my ears! I would return it, but I only paid like $6 for it so it seemed like a waste of time. I just won't buy any like these ever again. They fall right out of my ears as soon as I put them in even when I try smashing them a little or turning them. I think it's ridiculous, such a horrible product."
5,Good Product,Product was a great replacement of the standard IPOD earbuds. Has very good audio quality and fit very well in my ears. If you don't want to spend over $30 for new ear buds I recommend this product.
1,Good headphones that didn't last long,"I really liked these headphones - they gave me much better sound quality and felt more comfortable in my ears than the ones that came with my iPod. Unfortunately, I just bought them two months ago and they're already broken. If the cord gets twisted or nudged at all, I lose sound in one or both ears. The product itself was pretty good but it's not worth the money since they're not going to last."
2,Worthless in just under two months.,"I bought these and they were way more comfortable than the standard iPod buds, and they did a really good job at reducing outside noice. My issue is that I DID NOT abuse these, and by all visual inspections they appear fine, but the right ear bud cuts out unless I hold the wire at a very specific angle, right at the jack. I carried these around in my pocket, sometimes wrapped around my iPod when I wasn't using them, 90% of my usage was with my iPod on my desk, and the other 10% was on the bus with the iPod in my pocket. I guess wrapping it around the iPod was too much, and it's a shame that these are such poor quality that they have such a low abuse tolerance. Less than two months after getting them, they're worthless. At least they were cheap."
2,Poor value for the money.,I was very disappointed with these earbuds. The cord was stiff and heavy so the earbuds did not stay in my ears at all. Also I started have trouble with the sound cutting out after about a month of use compared to my last pair from a different company which lasted over a year of heavy use.
2,Great while they lasted,"I have had two pairs of these earbuds. Both broke within a few months. Each time, one of the earbuds stopped working. Wouldn't buy them again."
1,"Plug does not work. No sound, some crackling when jiggling it.","It didn't work in either my laptop computer or in my iphone. If I pressed in the connector/plug I could hear some crackling like it was making contacts and even short blips of sound but that was it. In my opinion it seems like a product flaw that could be in common to many of them so I would not buy another one or even a product from Jlabs again. Thankfully, I bought it through a wonderful company such as Amazon so it will be easy to return and get refund for."
2,A WARNING FOR ALL...,"Where sound is concerned, the headphones are mediocre. They do a good job of blocking outside noise, though. My biggest concern with this product is that...they break easily. I've bought two so far, each one broke within 30 days, despite my extra care when handling them - they broke for what seems like no reason. By ""broke"" I am referring to whenever I tough the headphone jack, even if it is the slightest touch (sometimes I don't need to touch it at all), the left or right speaker goes out. So I have to constantly fiddle with it to get the sound back, which is quite difficult to do; almost impossible. Basically DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
3,Don't buy these if you like to hum or sing,"nice earplugs/buds, but the give you the same sensation of putting your finger in your ear and humming. Fine if you don't sing or hum, but you'll be bugged with them if you like to sing along with the music."
4,value for money,"They are defiantly worth 20$, quite comparable to other high end ones costing $100 +. if u r don't wanna spend too much this is the best deal."
3,Fits good. Sounds mediocre...,"I first used the earphones that came with the iPod and noticed that they sounded ok, but worked loose from my ear even while sitting stationary. They always sound even better when I hold them in with my fingers. So I got a set of JBuds that worked quite well even when I was running on the treadmill. Except they sounded like I had the stereo on downstairs and was listening in the upstairs bedroom... real muddy.So now, I guess it's time to look at the Etymotic ER-6i since I've already spent about half as much on JUNK!Hey Apple Computer! You almost have a nice set of earphones! Why not design them for actual use!"
1,You get what you pay for...,These ear buds only lasted 4 months before the one of the ear buds stop working. While these had decent sound and comfort for the price...they definitely didn't last very long. I wouldn't recommend purchasing these ear buds.
5,9 Months in and I LOVE These Headphones!,"Just to let you know, if you're on the fence dont be. These headphones are a great price and they have a great sound. They are comfortable as well. I've been using them just about everyday at work for the last 9 months. HOURS at a time and they still sound and function great. I love the way they fit into my ear. I bought the white and the black set."
4,Good sound and stay in,"These work well, stay in and the sound quality is great. I would have given them a 5, but they don't have any mechanism to skip to the next song. I thought they would, but perhaps I should have read the description more closely."
2,left headphone stopped working,"Had it for slightly under 4 months as replacement headphones for my iPod. Would have given it 4 stars: decent sound, did a decent job of keeping external noise out for the price. But now the left earbud no longer transmits any sound. I don't subject them to any strenuous use or abuse. I only use them when I walk to and from work. Right earbud is still working fine, though that's not much of a consolation."
3,Earphones are a low cost,"The Jbuds have very good sound, but certainly little or no noise reduction except by the normal blockage of the ear canal. If the objective is noise reduction, look elsewhere; if the objective is a good and inexpensive earphone, consider these earphones."
2,Cheap for a reason,"These earbuds were cheap without being TOO cheap, which made them seem like the perfect choice to replace the stock earbuds that came with my mp3 player once they shorted out, resulting in the left bud not giving out any sound. I was happy with the JBuds when I got them, since they were comfortable and had better sound quality than the freebies. Overall, I was quite happy with them.However, I bought them in February, a mere three months ago. Today the left bud started shorting out when the jack wasn't positioned just right. Pretty pathetic considering that the free earbuds lasted TWO YEARS. I could get a new set of these under warranty, but I'll save myself from more hassle a few months down the line and buy a better, longer-lived pair of earbuds. Not recommended unless you want a throwaway set of earbuds, in which case you might as well get one of the brands of earbuds that cost ~$10 or less."
1,The Right Ear Bud Did NOT Work!!!,"This item came with a package deal... Since the Sandisk MP3 Player I bought with this ""package"" was the main item... (which by the way... was a great buy and paid for the entire package by being a quality product by itself) I wasn't too mad that these ear buds didn't work... I just charged it to the ""win or lose"" game of online shopping..."
3,"it's ok, thank god it was cheap","I got the buds back in July. It's November and the right side has already blown out. The sounds quality is great but I'm very disappointed that they weren't as durable as I hoped. When I got the earphones, I was a bit skeptical because they were packaged in only a ziplock bag and it had a cheap print out. There was no product information like most electronic packaging has. I have to say the sound quality is by far the best I've ever experienced and because they were $9.95 vs. $40.00 I will buy them again."
4,good buds,"They have good sound quality and bass, and are very comfortable, but sometimes they pop out when I grin. Maybe that's just me."
2,Good while they lasted,"I was very pleased with these headphones... that is, until they broke just like my last pair, and even more quickly. Maybe I'm too rough with my earbuds, but I was expecting better from a company with such high praise."
3,JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds,"I ordered these ear buds and received them promptly. I love this style for highest comfort in the ear, but found that within a couple weeks of fairly light use, wires were showing near the end I plug into my Sansa. The unit is still working for now, but when I saw this I was traveling and nowhere near my roll of electrician's tape. I have shopped for earbuds almost regularly now and am finding I have to pay about $20 to get the comfortable style, but regardless of pricing, they don't seem to last long. Frustrating, to say the least. For now, though, these are the best for comfort and performance that I've found, excluding the length of time before fraying."
3,You get what you pay for,"Don't fit THAT well in the ear, and sound is mediocre. Feel cheap but I guess it's what I paid for ($10). Would rather pay a little more for something nicer."
4,Love these ear buds in the gym,I received these as a present and I was surprised at how well they work. I had been previously using the default earphones that come with an iPod which are really uncomfortable. I go to the gym almost everyday so I was glad that these ear buds were comfortable and did a great job at noise reduction. I think they work well for the price.
2,BROKE QUICKLY!!!!!,"BOUGHT THESE 5 MONTHS AGO, AND EVEN THOUGH I TOOK UTMOST CARE, IT BROKE ANYWAY. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. I SUGGEST GOING FOR EARPHONES MANUFACTURED BY GOOD BRANDS. DONT GET FOOLED BY THE REVIEWS, OR THE ""STARS""."
3,To Much Base,There is to much base for my liking. Even with full trebel and reduced base output it is still a bit much for me.
2,jbud headphones,weak speakers. they were basically blown within a week and i didn't even listen to loud music. i would not recommend buying them.
1,Terrible,"this product is what you pay for and even worse. i found out that price is what really determines what a pair of ear phone are. i bought these because of the reviews and price but the quality sucks, its really bad i got a pair of free earphone with a purchase of my laptop and they were just as bad/good as these, if you are looking for a decent pair of ear phone, i recommend brookstones earphone(the one that loops around your ear, nice quality compared to these) also about 30 bucks, 5 more buck more than these minus shiping, just go to the store"
5,great for walks,They are very comfortable and not to long of a cord. I would tell people to purchase them very good.
5,Made a hit,My son loves them. He says that he hears his iPod better now on the lowest possible setting than he did with the sound turned up when he was using his old ear buds. He reports that the sound is great.
3,good not great,They have a weak sound and did not fit well. They are okay. Just okay. I was hoping for a hidden treasure purchase. This was not it.
2,right-side earbud died after 2 months,"Long story short. The right-side earbud stopped working after 2 months..first I thought it was the earbug itself then I found out it was the jack. When I wiggled the jack and held the wire a certain way, and remained still, it worked fine. After constantly holding\wiggling for a week, I decided to give up and throw it to away."
2,"Great for the first 7 months, then they broke.","So the sound on these was really pretty decent for the first 7 months, but the bast of the wire, right near the connector always felt a little weak to me. Well it finally happend, one of the copper wires inside must have finally worked itself loose, as I lose my left headphone completely. These headphones appeared to have worn out with the normal swaying motion of walking, and I live in SF, so I do a lot of walking."
4,good value,"I've had the JBuds for nearly a year now, and they've held up well. I would say that the noise reduction is decent, but not as significant as with my battery-powered Sony MDR-NC6. Very comfortable and good quality manufacturing."
4,Worth the price,"When I bought my Sandisk player, the headset that came with it hurt my ears. This headset is great. It is really soft when I have it in my ears and it does block out a lot of noise. I can hear the music clearly. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good headset with a reasonable price."
2,Not noise reducing,I bought these specifically for the noise reduction. They don't reduce noise anymore than normal earbuds. Sound quality is very good and they feel cheap. The one plus is that they are fairly comfortable. I bought the e2c from shure for noise reduction and they do a much better job at reducing noise and are higher quality.
2,Are You Deaf?,"As I write this, I see that 300+ people give these a five-star rating. WHAT?? Are you deaf? I'm a program producer, an FM radio DJ, and a lover of music. The sound that comes out of these is only marginally better than what one hears with two soup cans and a length of string. The bass is poor, the midrange mushy, and the treble tinny. If you want a good set of earbuds, go SONY. They're cheaper, and sound INFINITELY better. A side-by-side comparison is all you need. I wish I'd never bought these."
4,"Comfortable ear buds, good for the price","I was interested in these because I have smallish ears and the larger earbuds (such as the hard round ones that come with the iPod) hurt my ears. These are a great fit and are very comfortable. Unlike other sets, the left and right wires are the same length, which I prefer. The sound quality is good for the price. I had a set of $100 buds that sounded better and had much better noise reduction, but they were never comfortable, and two sets broke on me. I take a loud commuter train every day, and these hold up their end during most of the ride. When the train hits its loudest, however, they are outmatched. So don't get them if you are expecting great noise reduction, but do get them if you want a bargain earbud with a comfortable fit."
1,J-Buds Headphones,Love these headphones but this is my second pair that have broke on me. The same thing happened twice the wire comes out from the ear peice!! Not happy at ALL!!!!!!
3,"comfortable, well priced, extra buds - but weak on bass","I needed an extra pair of headphones for work. These are comfortable (the buds are soft), well priced, and come with extra buds (small, med, large). But the sound quality leaves something to be desired. The bass is weak, although tolerable. I was able to improve the sound some by boosting the 125K eq slider, but anything below that just caused distortion.If you've been using a higher quality set of earphones, you will definitely notice the difference in the lack of low-end. If you don't care about great range, these are fine. You get what you pay for.BTW - the 'noise reducing' feature of these headphones comes from the fact that you are sticking a soft rubber plug into your ear. It definitely helps to block out background noise. But don't confused this noise reduction for more expensive headphones which electronically monitor ambient sound levels and adjust accordingly."
3,Sound great but...,"Yes, they sound great. Also, they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. However, the construction is very cheap! I could cut through the wire insulation with my fingernail, and the wires are very thin. Be careful! I would have been willing to pay a little more for better construction. I would give it 3 and a half stars if the option were available."
3,"Decent sound, Not durable","I bought these earbuds in July, it's now December and they have crapped out on me. I feel like my use of them was normal. I'd use them with my little Sandisk Sansa Express player, carrying it all around in my pocket.What happened is the end by the plug has become flexed too much I guess. I have to twist and turn the wire in order to hear sound in the right ear now. They are basically worthless to me at this point. The plastic is just not very protective of the wires inside.They were good until they broke. I liked the different sizes of ear canal attachments."
4,Work great!,My brother kept complaining about how bad the ipod earphones sucks. I bought these as a gift for him and he has nothing negative to say about them!!
2,Good while they last!,"I loved these ear buds for my i-pod! They were so much more comfortable and allowed for greater volume than the white original ear buds that came with the i-pod. Unfortunately after about 5 months of use, the connection became choppy and finally it was gone. I was getting volume in only one ear until I finally lost all sound. I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,Save yourself $10 and get a pair of Sony's,"I got these after reading promising reviews. First I'm comparing these to mySony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds with Winding Caseused with my iPod Nano. The J-Buds have little or no bass compared to the Sony's. The Sony's are clear, comfortable and inexpensive for $9. The JBuds sound muddy and and drone in the midbass. They do, however, block out peripheral noise better than the Sonys.They're not worth the hassle of sending back so I'll likely just use them as a spare pair.Try a set of the Sonys from a local discount store before you get these and you may find yourself with a good set of $9 earbuds."
3,"Good, but not excellent...","Good enough for everyday use. Sound could be better, though.Overall - not bad."
4,Wurd,"not bad headphones for the price, the diff sized attachment pieces ensure you'll find a comfortable ""custom"" fit."
5,"Sound Quality is very nice, better than most of the branded name","Compared with all the brand named like Sony , JVC, this has the best sound quality. I meant the price is under $40.- range group."
2,Good while it lasted,I bought the pair towards January end and it's good as dead today (15th April). The sound in the right earphone is cutting intermittently. I was satisfied as long as it was working! I guess you can only expect so much from an earphone on a cheaper end.
3,they're just okay,"Granted these are $10 headphones, they rival headphones that are in the $20 range. But they certainly won't blow you away with hi-fi sound. The bass is nice, but at decent volume music seems to get muddled. It often sounds like the lows and highs are competing to be heard, and in the end its just one big mess. One thing I noticed is that these seem to be tuned for electronic music, which had much less distortion than rock/rap. Of course if your budget is $10 then these are about as good as you can hope for, but if you have a few more dollars and are looking for a really pleasant listening experience then look elsewhere."
2,save a few bucks,Was not impressed with these. They didn't want to stay in my ear. They come with three different sizes of adapters to fit your ear better but I had better luck with the earbuds included with sansa clip.
2,"OK, but very sensitive to twisting cord","These earbuds are great size and comfortable and fit well in your ear, but they dont last very long and are very sensitive to movement and are not very good if you plan to use them for running or exercising."
1,These work great for about 3 months,"This is the third set I've purchased. Each set had one Jbud go out after a few months. I kept trying them, thinking it was a fluke. After this latest time with the right side going out, I quit. I won't be buying them again. They are great while they last but who wants to have to buy new ones so often?"
1,DIDN'T LAST A DAY,For the 45 minutes these worked they were more than sufficient. The sound only works in one ear piece. Now I have to go through the trouble of a return... very annoying.
2,Sound quality sucks,"it fits comfortably, but there is not enough bass when you listen through these earphones. If you love your music and desire good quality sound, don't get these. There are better ones for the same price."
2,Great... when they work,"After purchasing this item twice, I can say that while the sound quality is good and its comfortability is great. These headphones seem to just die after a few months of use (4 months my first pair and 3 months my second pair). The problems start with one of the headphones dying and then the other a few weeks later. Though they are pretty cheap, I expect them to last the very least half a year if not an entire year. So keep that in mind if you plan on buying this."
4,Great Value!,"These are great little earphones for the price - I bought two and am glad I did. The cord is a little longer than I like, but that is a minor thing.......everything else suits me just fine. I am very happy with the fit, comfort and sound."
3,"Work fine, good price, but flimsy","I use these to listen to audiobooks in the gym, so they need to endure a certain amount of abuse. I order them in pairs for this reason. I reordered these ear buds because they're good at blocking out ambient noise like the bad music my gym plays, and nearby conversations, but I'm not going to reorder again. I expect them to wear out relatively quickly, but in something more like 6 months. These last about 2 months on average. Then the jack starts to wear out and either one bud cuts out, or the sound wobbles back and forth, etc. There are other cheap earbuds that last longer."
5,Wonderful Quality!!!,These earphones are fabulous. I purchased these for my daughter and she loves them. She said they have a wonderful noise cancelling quality. Great Buy!!
2,6 month FAIL,These buds gave very good sound quality for about 6 months. Then I noticed they needed to be bent a certain way at the computer connection or one bud would cut-out.I nursed them for another 6-9 months by playing with the connection before they finally gave out.Now I use some non-cushioned buds that have only 80% of the sound quality but cost $0.99. Oops!
3,everything went great for 5 months until..,"I purchased this headphones in April/May. I really love this headphone because i think this is the best you can get for this price. The fit and sound quality is excellent. I use this almost everyday for about 1-2 hours per day.After about 5 months of using, the right side of the headphones started to die. i had to twist the headphone jack (i dont know what it's called) to fix it. Then after a few days the right headphones just died. I am very disappointed in the quality of the chord of this headphone. This doesn't mean that the sound quality is bad, the sound quality is impressive, however i cannot enjoy it if the right headphone is dead."
3,ehh,"you will know that you bought something cheap,, but overallthe sound isolation is working eh okunplugging apple ipod`s original earphones, it feels like i opened all the bass and crippled the restlouderyou still can buy itit is very cheap and isolates.."
3,Good for the item cost but shipping is costly,I bought these ear phones just because it had 1770 reviews and the rating was still 3.5. I tried gummies just before these and I should say that these had a far better sound quality than the Gummies. The ear phones started sounding pretty good ( I mean to say the bass) after the 'burn in' period. I watched a HD movie in these phones on my laptop and I should say I am quite satisfied with the clarity from this piece which is why I decided to write a review for this! I would recommend it for a reasonably quiet environment but not while commuting in noisy environments because the noise cancellation is absent in this.
3,Ill-fitting,"They're just like any other earbuds you can buy for 10 dollars or less, don't let the original price fool you."
3,am buying a different set,"Just okay,I got the same results as if using a cheap set of ear pieces from any other radio shack store"
3,Sound Isn't Great,"I'm comparing this to the skull candy ink'd earbuds. These earbuds are mediocre. Everything that comes out of the earbuds sound ""hollow."" The only plus to this is that the cord is long. I use these for running, and they stay if fairly well. If you really just need a cheap pair of earbuds, then get this. I believe I bought something that is better than these at Ross. I would suggest these as a ""knock around"" type of earbud."
3,JBuds,I got these for 5 bucks and gave them to my granddaughter (she loves them). I liked them enough to get myself an upgrade.
1,poor quality control,"purchased for my wife for christmas. she uses them on her i pod shuffle while she works. they didn't even make it to new years, she had me listen and there is a bad connection in the right ear phone!!! i realize that these are not very expensive ear buds but they should last longer than that!!!!"
5,I Really Really Love These Earbuds,"I've tried my new JBuds on simple radios, mp3 players, Ipods, my portable dvd player and I'm so amazed with the high quality sounds, clarity, and reduction of outside noise. And I just love the hot candy pink color. All my old lady friends want one - young ones too. Don't say I said that my JBuds are better than my previous S___ ear buds. The 18k plated prong seems to decrease static, and provide great and clear conduction. Just enjoy."
1,complete crap,This is the 2nd pair I have owned. The first pair lasted 4mos. & the 2nd pair has lasted barely 3mos. I live in NYC & use my IPod a lot & the headphones cannot take normal wear-and-tear. One earphone always dies.
3,OK,"I received these headphones as part of the Pepsi Stuff promotion and I love them. They never hurt my ears after wearing them for too long; they're very comfortable! But what really annoys me is that when I'm wearing them (plugged into the computer) and not actually listening to any sounds at the moment, it sounds all static-y and after a while it really gives me a headache."
1,"Good, for a cheap pair.","This item is very poor in quality. If you need something to take on a trip where there is a possibility of getting ruined, by all means buy. If not, I would highly suggest going down to your local store and buying a $10 skullcandy."
3,there ok,not as good as the panasonic ones. my kids are 13 and 15 and they say these hurt there ears.
3,Meh - Panasonics are better,"I bought a couple of the cheap Panasonic ear phones and liked them. Bought a pair of these and not impressed. These don't stay in my ears. Maybe ok if you are sitting at a desk. If I walk with these, every 10 feet they fall out. Sound is no better than Panasonics."
3,Ear buds.,"Although this set is slighly bigger for my ears, I still could use it. No complaints about it. This may be due to size of my ears."
5,Great Value,"Use the ear buds while working out. The stay in my ears while running and have good range, highs and lows. Recommended if you don't want to spend alot."
2,Does not reduce noise,"I bought this item due to great reviews here and needed noise reducing headphones for my daily commute. When I tried it, it did not reduce noise at all, despite trying all the earbud attachment sizes. All background noise was unaffected. Even the faintest background noise (such as the sound of water from the faucet) could still be heard 100%. My wife tried these earphones and had the same conclusion. I am returning this product. The only advantage is the price and nice L-shaped connection jack."
3,They are OK,"I bought these for use with my office PC. The 4.5 ft length is just fine (and I knew about it before buying). I tried all 3 sizes of the buds that came along, but none of them seem to fit comf'ly. The non-bud (the plastic part) of the earphone itself is big. And compared to my other in-ear buds that came with my sony ericsson w580i, I found the base a little weaker.Usually, with these kinds of in-ear buds, you won't get the proper base until you get the right fit. So, it's possible that the base is fine, but only that I cannot get them in right position inside my ear."
2,didn't last long,"I was happy with them while they worked (although the cord was excessively long), but the left speaker stopped working yesterday, about half a year after my purchase. What do you expect for ten bucks, though?"
3,"Good quality, but poor durability","The sound quality on these earbuds was pretty good, and for the past few months I've had no complaint with them. However, several days ago, the right earbud broke. Now I can only get sound in that earbud if I twist it exactly the right way, and as soon as i move my iPod, the sound stops. I haven't given them more than the usual wear and tear, and since i have only had them for a few months i am dissapointed in their durablility."
2,$20 lasts only three months...,"After having the Jbuds Headphones (which I was happy with for the past three months), the right headphone broke and has stopped working. I'm left with having to buy another set of headphones once again."
2,"Very comfortable, but sound is muddy","Pros: These earbuds are very comfortable and did not fall out of my ear. I wore these during a 1-hour cardio session on a treadmill and bike and had no comfort issues at all. Also, the noise cancellation was excellent - I was amazed at how low I could turn down the volume on my iPod.Cons: The sound that comes out of these headphones is unfortunately very muddy since the treble response is very poor (I compared them to standard Apple headphones). I tried adjusting the EQ to Treble Boost, which did help, but they still didn't sound as good as the Apple headphones. I also tried ""breaking in"" the headphones by turning up the volume really loud for an extended period of time, but that did not help either. It was as if I was listening to a cassette tape instead of my iPod. I ended up returning these due to the poor sound quality."
3,Sound quality is merely satisfactory,"They sound so-so. Sony MDR-EX51LP sounds notably better. I ended up using it just for spare ear cushions, not for listening."
3,Ear Buds,These are comfortable ear buds but I don't think they reduce the noise like they say they do.
4,"Wow, Day 1 with these buds and I'm IMPRESSED!","Rarely am I inclined to write a review for anything but these buds are pretty amazing. I've had Shure EC2s and a $100 pair of Creative noise cancelling buds and these, by far, sound better than both models. The lows are punchy, the mids are not over-powering, and the highs are not piercing. Of course, your EQ can always affect this, but pumping them through my iPod (which notoriously have horrible EQs) sounds great!Other reviews state longevity and durability as the major issue. We shall so how they hold up!"
4,Excellent Value! Works with Iphone!,"Great product. Just got it today and I'm delighted. Plugged it into my iphone and laptop sounds great. Hubby bought some fancy noise canceling headphones that were expensive. I compared it to these and while not noise canceling, I do agree that is it is noise reducing. It has exceeded my expectations for a small investment of $9.99. Bravo."
2,Dislike,"While these earphones do fit comfortably, it feels as if I'm listening to my music, video, etc. underwater. The sound quality is absolutely dreadful. Waste of a $10 if you ask me."
3,cant beat the price,"10 dollars! great ear buds for the price. They aren't prefect and the sound quality isn't the best ever, but these are still very good. I would recommend them to anyone looking for economy ear buds. good deal!"
2,Worse than the factory Clip+ ear buds,"I just did a quick A/B comparison of the JLab JBuds ear buds vs. the ones that come with the Sansa Clip+ 8gb, and they are tinny and weak. The factory SanDisk ear buds are much louder at any volume, and have more bass. They do fit well, but for sound quality, save your money."
2,Did everything I wanted except last for more than a couple months!,"Look, for the price these are great expect that they're not made to last. I got a couple months good use out of them and then they started shorting out. I didn't do anything more than the normall stuff you do while walking around the city with your iPod. They're just not made to last. If that's no big deal to you then buy them. I, however, prefer to buy something that will last at least a year or two."
2,Great while they lasted... which wasn't that long.,"I've owned a pair of these ear buds for just under a year and always treated them well (never wound them, stepped on them, etc.). They were great at blocking out noise and fit comfortably in my ears, but without warning, one ear stopped working. I've owned other brands of ear buds for years and years (I have an old Sony pair that I bought in the late '90s) that still are in working order, so I'm bummed that these didn't go the distance. I won't be buying this brand again, that's for sure, especially since I'm not the only reviewer who's experienced this particular problem."
2,earphones,"When I opened the product and listened to them for the first time, the sound wasn't right. I had to hold the earphones in the Ipod to get sound out of both sides. After only having them for about a month, the one ear is completely broken."
4,First purchase,Very happy with the product. Quick delivery and low price. Functional and comfortable with good sound output.
2,Thin sound,"I bought these for travel use, thinking the noise suppresion fit of the buds would be useful. What I didn't expect based on the reviews, was the shockingly poor bass and midrange. These buds sound positively shrill compaired with the standard phones that came with my 2nd Gen I-pod mini. Pass on these."
2,Poor Sound Quality & Doesn't stay in Your Ears,"$9.95 is truly a bargain, but not for this. The sound quality is horrible and the buds do not stay in your ears without forcing them in. Since I don't like them and don't need them, I'd have to pay $5.01 to ship them back - so there is no refund to get. Lesson learned."
5,I love these!,These can't be beat for the money! They fit my unusually small ears and the sound quality is great. The cord length is a little too long for my liking but it's not a big problem. I've tried lots of other earbuds and am most satisfied with these.
1,Bad Fit,"I purchased this earphone to use with my Sansa Clip while running. I cannot position the earbuds with any of the 3 different covers, so that the unit stays in place in my ears. Therefore, it is useless to me. They need stiffer covers."
2,"Weak bass, highs ok but not impressive - not worth money paid.","I paid $15, relatively low in terms of Hi-Fi earbuds. If Coby can sell ""Super Bass"" models on Amazon at around $5 or $6 which perform quite well, I don't see why this earbud should have been such a weak performer. These earbuds are some of the most poorly performing I have seen (at the price). Bass output is way down from that of the actual recorded music I am listening to."
4,Be sure to clean out earbuds if you use a lot -,"This item is a great value - no doubt.After using my earbuds for a few weeks, the sound started to go down progressively, and I thought I had blown yet another set of earbuds. BUT actually when I sat down and did some cleaning with a tack (carefully), I realized that my earwax had stopped up the insides and was the reason for the sound decreasing. A little careful cleaning and the earbuds were back to their original clear and loud sound.PROS: great value, great sound, pretty resilient, block out noise well because they fit in earCONS: if you wear a lot you definitely need to clean the gunk out every once in a while, I find that running I can hear the cord bouncing (it is annoying, but I can block it out), with them in and turned up you can definitely not hear much from the outside but I guess that is either a con or a pro depending on the situation (perfect for DC metro commute!)"
2,"good, but then one stopped working","I was going to write a glowing review for these because I was so satisfied with both the sound quality and comfort that I received with them, but then one of the ear bud's ouput went out. I can only hear out of it if I move the jack around a lot and find a good spot, so it's become extremely annoying to walk around with these on because when I move, the jack moves and the sound in the one ear is sporadic. I took good care of them, there was no reason for them to stop working, especially since I had only had them for six months. Now I have to buy another pair or walk around without one ear bud. They were great while they lasted but you have to ask yourself if it's worth spending money on them when you're just going to have to replace them shortly rather than buying a better, albeit it more expensive pair that will last longer - or if you should buy a different pair at a similar price and hope that they don't break so quickly"
4,Great Ear Buds,These things are great for blocking out the music at the gym and are a very comfortable fit to the ear. The ones that came with my ipod didn't fit properly and I had to have the volume up so I could hear my music (and even then I could still hear outside music). The cord is very long and I haven't quite figured out how to deal with that...guess it's better to have too much than not enough. I would definitely buy these again.
4,Fantastic company! Too bad the product doesn't quite live up to them.,"These were such an enormous improvement over the standard earbuds that came with my ipod, but the sound on them died within a few months of purchase - something with the wiring near the plug. I wrote to JLabs to see how I could get replacements since they were under warranty, and they responded promptly and offered to send my the J2 to try out in addition to replacements for the JBuds. I never got the JBud replacements, but I didn't really care, since the J2s were fantastic.In short: JBuds are an amazing buy, especially for what they charge on Amazon. They're absolutely the best quality you're going to get for $10-20, but don't expect durability out of anything that inexpensive."
2,Great ear buds... until they broke!,"I really liked these. My ears are on the small side, so it's hard to find ear buds that fit my ears. These came with 3 different sized rubber pieces to ""custom fit"" for your ears, and they worked great... until they stopped reliably transmitting sounds from my ipod/computer. I'm guessing the wires became bent/separated at the part where they connect to the hard metal piece that plugs into the ipod/computer.I am very, very bummed as now I'll have to buy new ones. Especially since I only owned these for ~2 months."
2,"Not so great at noise reduction, no bass",Purchased these JBuds as a replacement for my son's Sansa Clip 2gb headphones. The Sansa's headphones had a great sound but one side died after a couple of weeks so I bought these as a replacement. The Jbuds fit comfortably in his small ears (he's 13) and the sound is clear enough but it doesn't block external noise and there is almost no bass at all. There are adapters for larger or smaller ears (it comes with 3 sets of soft plastic adapters.) The mini jack is at a right angle which makes it a nice fit on the Sansa Clip. The wire is 5' long and splits to about 2' before you hit the stopper.I purchased a set of inexpensive Skull Candy ear buds and they are much better at blocking noise with outstanding bass performance and clarity. I would not buy these JBuds again and do not recommend them.
2,Not that Great,"I bought this product to replace my broken Zune ear buds. When I received the product, I found that there are small easily losable rubber ends that change the size. None of these fit well, and with light movement they always fall out. The benefit of this product is that it does a rather decent job of reducing outside noise (In is not designed to block out noise completely). Another issue that I have had with this product is that after about a week of use, I noticed that one of the buds was playing significantly louder than the other one. This was not a very good purchase."
2,"They sound crappy, but what do you expect for $10?","I use my iPod mostly to listen to podcasts and audiobooks, so it doesn't much matter... but the sound from these earbuds is very muffled, a bit like listening under-water. If you care about sound, look elsewhere. If you're looking for noise-reducing earbuds for spoken word only, these are acceptable, though just barely."
3,Good deal for price,"These aren't the best ear buds on the market, but they may be the best for the price. The sounds quality is good for such an inexpensive ear bud, and I don't worry about losing or breaking them since they didn't cost much. They don't stay in my ears very well, but I don't don't use them while I'm active (I have another pair for that), so it doesn't matter."
4,do the job for the price,"well made, isolate outside noise better than any others in the price range. bass response isnt the best, but it isnt horrible either. 3 sizes of rubber inserts are a nice addition."
4,Very nice earbuds,"I like these earbuds a lot. I am not very discriminating about earphone sound quality, so I won't comment to that other than to say they sound really good to me. What I like best is that they come with different size earpieces. I have to wear very small ones, or they hurt my ears. The small set that came with these are just perfect. Very, very comfortable."
2,"If you sweat, they'll fall out","The cord is of moderate length, but the earbuds just simply won't stay in when you're sweating and moving.If you're not moving, however, they do an excellent job of blocking outside sounds."
4,Great Sound,We have used our Sony ear buds for years with our portable DVD player and I wanted to get something for each of our lap top computers. I order these JBuds as they were on sale at a super price and after comparing them with the Sonys I ordered two more pairs with travel cases and retired the Sonys. In our opinion the JBuds have a much clearer sound. I would high recommend them.
2,Meh,"I was a bit disappointed with these after reading review that the sound quality was great. I'd say it was average. They door a poor job of blocking out ambient noise too. I have another pair of buds that came with my Ericsson cell phone that are far superior to these at both sound quality and reducing ambient noise. Unless you get a great deal, not worth spending too much."
3,Solid purchase for $10,-Weak bass.-Flat Sounds.-Cheap plasticy feel.-Comfortable. Comes with three different ear setting pieces.-Good purchase for only $10. I don't think I'd pay much more for this quality.My kitten chewed up the cord to my old creative ep-630s.I feel like the Jbuds are a significant downgrade.
5,Great for the Price,"I am not an audiophile, but I do use headphones a lot (both for music and for my computer) so I was looking for a nice comfortable (yet inexpensive) pair of headphones. I've been using these for a few weeks and I like them a lot! They fit snugly into my ears, to the point where I have to set the volume on my iPod down lower than I had to with my old headphones because the 'seal' is so snug. Theses come with different earbud pads (in different sizes) but I found that the standard set that came on them works great for me. Don't expect Bose quality, but for about $10 I think they sound better than most similar quality headphones I've used."
1,You get what you pay for!,I have bought several Jbuds over the last couple of years. They sound great but they don't last. My longest lasting Jbud worked for 6 months.
3,Evolution: Eh to Good to Broken,"It took a while for my ears to adjust to JBuds--they caused soreness for a while. From what I understand, it's just about the shape of your ears (i.e. hit or miss). Once my ears adjusted, I was pleasantly surprised by the noise-cancellation. I often commute by walking on a noisy street and could finally listen to podcasts without blowing out my ear drums or missing important commentary. The sound quality was significantly better than the standard Apple earbuds. JBuds became my primary listening method at home and work. But, alas, it's a mere four or five months later and the right bud is dying (hence the past tense). It cuts out with the slightest movement. I take care of my ""toys;"" I can't imagine how short a lifespan these things have with someone who plays hard."
1,Cheap and Cheap no Comfort,These are definitely not for sports or wearing while moving. The rubber earbuds are non gripping and very thin. I changed mine out with left over rubbers from an old pair and they were much better. Clear sound but they just don't stay in your ear. Cable is a little too long but they at least have the slack tie to bring the earbuds togeter and not have them get tangled in your bag but look out for the rubbers to fall off.
2,Sounded good but didn't last,I bought these because I thought they were a good deal at $10 but after one week one of the ear buds quit working.
1,Incredibly awful sound quality,"My standards for sound quality aren't that high, but the sound through these headphones is so unbelievably horrible that I can't use them. The sound is extremely quiet, tinny, and has no bass. The sound is equally bad through all of my music devices, and changing equalizer settings does nothing. These may be cheap and relatively comfortable, but I wish I'd spent a few more dollars to get something better. I'll go back to my less comfortable iPod earbuds."
1,"Terrible sound quality, just awful","I received these earbuds today and was simply shocked at the terrible sound quality they offered. These are possibly the worst earbuds I've ever heard. Just to make sure, I A/B tested them against inexpensive models from Sennheiser and Sony that I had handy and confirmed the fact that the JBuds ""Hi-Fi"" earbuds are nowhere near high fidelity. Jbuds includes a frequency response chart on the package which boasts fairly even response down to 20Hz. This is just a straight out lie. These earbuds could barely reproduce low-mids. There was nothing audible in the bass range at all, a stark difference from *any* earbud at *any* price I had ever used. These are going back to Amazon as soon as possible."
4,Good value.,Good for the money. Not complete noise isolation but good for in the ear phones. Wish they had a volume control. Over all comfortable with decent bass response.
4,Nice buds,An excellent replace set of earbuds for stock headphones. They fit nicely and sound great.
2,Ok ear,"Unlike most other customers, I really don't find this earphones to be all that great. It is average. I really don't find it block out the background noise. The ear buds take a little time to get used to."
4,"good sound, poor construction","The sound was good. We we're impressed with the noise reduction feature, especially given the price, but the rubber cover of one of the earbuds got lost just a couple of days after we bought it. Apparently, it's not set in place."
1,AWFUL!!,"These headphones were absolutly terrible! i got them and read good reviews on them and when they arrived the next day i plugged them into my ipod and when i plug them in all the way it makes the singers voice sound like they are singing under water. and if you pull the jack out a little ways, you can hear them fine. but if you are a runner or even walking with this jack out a little ways, it falls right out. So i thought ""well, maybe it isnt the headphones, maybe its my ipod plug in."" So i went on the computer, and plugged them in there and started listening to music and sure enough, it was doing the same thing."
1,don't do it...keep shopping.,"HA! At my age, I should have learned, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I am no sound 'expert' but dude, I don't need to be in order to say, these are junk. No..NO..NOOO blocking of ambient noise...the sound quality is marginal at best. That is being gracious to describe it as marginal. Trust me, they look crappy, sound crappy...LESSON LEARNED. I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO Target AND GOTTEN ANOTHER PAIR OF SONY EAR BUDS. This was money out the window. ):"
2,Doesn't fit.,I don't know how good this product is as the medium earpieces are too small and the large earpieces too large. I don't have oddly shaped ears. This has never been a problem for me before. I don't want to waste my time/money sending it back.
1,Great For One Ear,"Just hooked up the buds and they worked great - for one ear. Now most folks might find that a problem, but it's not. Just switch buds when you want to hear from the other side!"
2,Average Earbud. Seems cheap,"I was expecting a pretty good experience reading all the reviews, but what I found was a very average earbud. My apple one finally died and it was hard to hear even when volume is at the max. This earbud sound was a bit better than the stock apple earbud, but it's not very comfortable for me. I changed to the smallest earbud of the 3 that was available, and it still hurts my ears a bit. It is tolerable earbud, but I would try another one next time."
3,5 stars for sound excellent and 1 star for workmanship.,I have order at least 8 pairs of these JBuds or more because i love the sound.But the right side speaker keeps going out.
3,ummmmmmmmmm it sucked,so they head phones lasted me about two months before they broke so i try to contact the seller and i cant crapy produce crapy costumer service
2,Meh! Got what I needed,I just needed ear buds that were a little deeper than apple's. These do the trick. I don't use them for music so don't need the sound fidelity. Just listen to NPR :)
1,Crap,"Wow, with over 1,000 reviews this product has an overall 4 star review? There must be some kind of scam going on here, it doesn't make any sense because these ear buds are crap. When I took these ear buds out of there packaging I immediately notice just how poorly put together they were, the actual ear bud rubber look as if it was deteriorating and I was concerned about putting it in my ear. If anything you buy this year shouts `made in China' or `made in Taiwan', it's these. Well, when I saw them I immediately knew that I would never wear them because they would probably dissolve in my ear so I promptly returned them."
2,you get what you pay for...,"These earbuds aren't great. They don't feel very tight in your ears - kinda like they're about to fall out. The sound quality is acceptable, but nothing to brag about. I haven't had any problems with them, but i don't use them that often because they're pretty crummy, so that's not saying much.Anyways, unless you absolutely can't spend any more, I wouldn't recommend these earbuds. If you can spend a little more, I'd go for it and get something you won't regret."
4,Great Bang for the Buck,"I have really enjoyed these ear buds. I knew the buds that came with my nano were going bad because I had to max out the volume and still could barely hear the podcasts I listen to. Well with these the volume is turned down and I hear the podcasts fine. They may not be true noise cancelling, but the tight fit of the buds does seal out a lot of ambient noise. A little nit pick is the wire seems flimsy, but I have had no problem with it.A great product at a great price."
2,Don't think you're getting a bargain,"I bought these to replace my worn-outSony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia In-The-Ear Headphones (Black)and stupidly, thought I would save a few bucks by buying the Jlab earbuds this time around. I had become quite attached to the in-ear design, having discovered that it gives vastly superior sound quality and outside-sound blocking above the old style of standard earphone designs. I thought, well, these are in-ear headphones, they surely give similar quality sound, right? Wrong. After trying them out for a day, I got curious and plugged in my old Sonys (ragged but still functioning) and the difference was dramatic. The Sonys gave crisp highs and booming bass, and clear sound. The Jlabs, by comparison, was like listening to music underwater. So take it from me, spend the extra $10 or $20 and get yourself some Sonys or equivalent mid-price range headphones."
2,One ear went out after one month,These earbuds only lasted one month before the left ear went out. They sounded great. They looked great. Then suddenly the left earbud just stopped working.
4,Great deal for OK earbuds.,"I like these for some things, like listening to audio books, or listening to TV shows at the computer when the wife is watching the big TV (both are in the same room). They are OK for music too, but don't expect high performance like with NuForce - NE-6 ear buds - $39.00 here on Amazon (the extra 30 or so bucks goes a looong way).In their favor, these are one of the more comfortable buds I've owned. They fit well and do a good job of noise isolation.Overall, I'm glad I bought them. I wear buds -for hours- every day and so these have their place, and the comfort level + price + sound quality = a great deal for modestly performing comfy ear buds."
2,Stopped working after 1 month,"I ordered these headphones on August 20th. Today is September 28th, and for the past week my headphones have been static-y and I can't use them anymore. I'm not sure if I got a faulty pair, or if all of these headphones die soon after ordering, but I have to say that I didn't even use these headphones that much.Pros:Good fit. You get 3 pairs of the silicone ear buds so that you get a quality fit to your ears. This was helpful for me because I needed the smallest pair, and the larger size really hurt my ears.Good sound quality. I think I spent around 10 dollars on these? But the quality of listening was great. Really good quality for a small amount of money.Superficially, they're very cute. I got the pink earbuds to match the pink JLab Samba Travel case, and the pink case I already had for my iPod.Cons:Definitely that they stopped working after one month. But other than that there's nothing I can think of."
2,Do Not Last,"Like many others have pointed out, this item has some serious design flaws. After about a couple of months one of the earphones stopped working. I bought about three of these, thinking that the problem was due to an improper handling on my part. Same thing happened to all of them. A lot of Amazon reviewers have pointed out the same thing.On the positive note - they are very comfortable and provide a decent sound for the price. You will just have to buy a new pair every three months."
2,Waste!,"These are plenty of useless headphones, they got broke very soon, cheap built quality and no sound quality at all... please get something better for some extra bucks."
3,Can Someone Please Recommend Some Good-Sounding Earbuds that Have a Cord That Doesn't Short-Out by the Plug?,"As soon as I write this review I am arranging to return these Jbuds to Amazon. This is the 3rd or so pair of Jbuds I have owned, purchased from Amazon. I like the value, I like the sound quality. But when it comes to durability, they are disappointing.I have used these for literally less than one week, light usage, really; they have already become useless in the same way every other pair of these I have had previously have become useless: the wire has shorted-out where the wire connects to the plug. If I manipulate the wire I can momentarily hear the sound in the Left earbud, then it shorts-out again.Why cannot I find some earbuds that sound good, last awhile without shorting-out, without costing an arm & a leg?"
4,"comfortable, good deal","These are a good deal for the money. Sound is quite decent, and they're very comfortable. The cord is way too long for use w/an Ipod Nano on your arm, so be aware of that; I wrap it around the nano to keep it out of the way, but it's a bit horsey. The noise cancelling is not great with these, but it's OK. I use them in a pretty loud health club, so wish they were better at keeping out the outside noise. Nice that they come in white or black. Overall, I recommend."
2,Waste of money,"I'd rather use the earphones that came with my iPod than use these. It takes some real maneuvering to get them to stay in the ears. Once they're in and secure, the sound quality is average. I listen to different types of music and didn't hear anything great about these ear buds."

1,The Two Week Headphones,"In all respects except one this is a good product. The cord connection gave out in two weeks, so now I have great mono-sound with comfort, or I have great stero sound by physically holding the cord at a 178 degree angle. I'll not be buying this again."
2,Broken in 3 months,"I bought these headphones for 2 reasons:1. the price was good and2, the product reviews were goodAnd when I got them they worked really well. They blocked out a lot of outside noise, they fit well in my ears and the sound was pretty good. I use headphones heavily, probably for at least 5-6 hours a day so they worked extremely well. I And then I took them with me on vacation. Halfway through my trip the sound in one ear began stopped working. I continued to use them, being on vacation and not near any stores at the time. Then less than a week later the sound in the other ear stopped working as well.In short, great headphones, if they actually worked."
2,pretty crappy sound,i guess you get what you pay for. for $10 its probably worth it but wouldn't pay a cent more.
3,"Great sound, but questionable reliability","I bought these earphones about 6 months ago when the cord on my original iPod earbuds started to strip and you could see the wires. I was in love with the sound immediately and couldn't have been more pleased with my purchase. Recently, however, the left earbud shorted out and produces sound only when the cord is held ""just-so"". When I came back on to check out the reviews I discovered more than a few people with the same problem. I'm about to order a second set at half the price I paid 6 months ago to see if the problem recurs...if so it will be the last time I mess with this product."
2,Good - while they lasted,"I was happy with these. I mainly use them for listening to audio books and podcasts on the bus so they were great for blocking out excessive noise. (They weren't sufficient to help when mowing the lawn.) I can't comment so much on the sound quality for music. However, the internal wiring must be cheap because after two months of use, the sound to one of the buds cuts in and out. I would suggest spending more money to get something of higher quality."
3,It's OK... still not worth it for me,"I was excited to get a headphones with so many reviews from here with decent ratings.... but honestly I wouldn't buy this headphones again even if it was $5.Pros: Cheap...Cons: Honestly,bad sound (I mean really bad in my experience)bad wiring (crackles if you move the cord esp. at the connector end)plastic earpiece is very thin and doesn't feel snugDon't know if I just got the bad one of the bunch but oh well, I still use it for non-music stuff (Nintendo DS) =P"
3,Good value for the money,These headphones are a good value for the money. The sound is okay but they hurt my ear a little when I leave them in too long. I listen to music most of the day at work so I need headphones that are comfortable. Not sure I'd buy them again but they're a good backup pair.
3,Typical rise and fall of earbuds...,"Bought these earbuds back in May 2011. They worked wonderfully, giving me a good amount of ""full"" sound, including and especially bass. I left them on the shelf for about a month and a half and recently pulled them out. To my dismay, they are going the way of all cheaper headphones and earbuds - the sound changes depending on the positioning of the cord. So I've got to generally keep the cord straightened, or curved, or whatever in order to get an unaffected listening experience. They weren't that expensive, and I got good use out of them, but I had hoped that they would at least last for a year."
4,"good headphones, but i know better quality exists elsewhere","overall, these are good headphones. and they are worth the amount that I payed for them. the sound comes out pretty clear, and you can DEFINITELY hear the bass. and while these headphones are decent, i will say that these headphones are not the BEST quality. so, if you're looking for ""ultimate"" headphones, then I would probably keep looking. if you're looking for headphones to listen to your music on your way to work, when you're waiting, or sleeping, then these are just fine."
2,sound quality is not good,"simply put, sound quality is not as nice as my $6 panasonic headphones i bought on amazon. hi range frequencies clash at medium/loud volumes and isn't very clear. not worth 10 bucks"
4,nice ear buds,I think these are nice ear buds for the price. They also arrived in a very timely fashion. I would shop here again.
3,not that great,"I am quite disappointed with this purchase. I feel like I guess I really did get my money's worth. I bought them because they were cheap on the side and they do not work as noise reduction at all. I am unhappy with the purchase. Do not recommend them if you're looking for noise reduction headphones. Otherwise they work ""alright"" as normal headphones."
3,"I expected more from the reviews, but the price was good.","Noise reduction is decent, they don't hurt my ears like other in-ear headphones do, and seem relativity sturdy. I wish I could say they sounded superb but the sound is iffy at best. It's muddy and the bass is far too high compared many of my other headphones.I bought these for cheap workout headphones that I wouldn't mind getting ruined and that's exactly what I got."
2,broke easily,"I had to buy new earplugs only a couple months after I got these, seems the wire came loose on one ear and I lost all sound."
1,Great sound bad construction.,"These ear buds do fit nicely and do produce a great listening experience, however their construction is less than great. In fact it is pretty bad. I have purchased two jbuds and both had the same problem within 6 weeks. Where the wire meets the plug began tearing within a 6 week period. Not a great value."
3,Good for the price,"These are ok. Not the best, but they're good for the price. They are comfortable, and sound great. However, they're not really ""Noise reducing."" I tried them out watching TV and listening to my iPod, and I could still hear the TV. The sound quality is great though, for $10. If you're looking for real noise reducing or canceling, shell out the extra money to get ones that do it."
2,Not as comfortable as other reviewer said,"Sound quality is about the same as the original ear phone came from the MP3 player, but not as comfortable as the original one."
2,JBuds,"Though earphone is fitted into my ears, the sound quality is not acceptable for me. Bass is weak, treble is flat."
2,"Good Comfort, Good Sound, Loses Sound On Right Side After One Month","Hey, the price is great... So I thought I would try them.The Sound is good... not great, but for the price... can't beat it.The earbuds are extremely comfortable.....much better than most.However, to prove the maxim you get what you pay for... these earbuds are poorly manufactured and not reliable. After a month of very gentle use... the right side earbud just dies. After checking the reviews, it is clear this is a common problem. Spend a bit more for the durability (for me, I now prefer the Altec Lansing UHP336 Snugfit In-ear Earphone, better sound, comfortable and they are built to last)."
2,Not a good investment,"I just received these ear buds and I am quite disappointed. I do not expect these to last very long at all. The sound is not the problem for me, it's just that it seems to be of poor quality materials. The cord itself is very, very thin so it's already apparent that the wiring is not very well protected. When I put the plug into my iPod if I even slightly twist the plug while it is in the jack I will get a lot of static. Not worth $20."
3,Not for working out with,"These sounded okay, but kept falling out if I tried to get on gym cardio equipment with them. Not great."
4,"JBUDS THE ""BOMB DIGGITY""","Very good product at a bargain price. I bought my first pair a little more than a year ago. My cat got hold of them. She bit the buds! Had to get another pair with the travel case. There may be better on the market but for quality/price comparison, these are great! They cut back a lot of noise and are very good on sound quality. Skullcandy is no match for these guys."
2,good for a few months,I got these 4-5 months ago. At first I was in love with them. It fit well and the sound was great. It also reduces a lot of outside noise. I used them pretty frequently - during my commute to and from work as well as the gym. A few weeks ago the sound started to fade and the right ear piece started to crackle. Now the right piece is completely shot and I can only hear out of one side. I just trashed them. I'm going to try the v-moda's next. I hope I get more luck with these.
3,Worked great for a couple of months,"I really liked the earbuds. Thye where very comfortable and I used them during my excercise routine almost daily. My problem is that after 3 months, one of the earbuds stopped working."
5,Works great,It was the best five dollars on a pair of headphones I've ever spent. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.
1,an unforgetable experience,I can only give one star because i wanted these ear buds just for the colors....... I'm a Pittsburgh Steeler fan and I never got to enjoy this product because Amazon could not deliver them to my place of business. which really sucked for i have recieved many items from Amazon. it does not make sense
2,i hate these ear buds!,"the sound wasn't even that good honestly, imo. And the ear buds NEVER stay in my ear and it hurts just fighting with them overall."
5,"Comfortable ear buds, finally","I have a very small ear canal, so these ear buds with different sized soft inserts available are wonderful! They are the first ones I can actually put IN my ear that will stay, because they are not too big to fit comfortably. And the noise reduction is great at work when I need to concentrate."
2,Keep falling out of my ear!,"Okay, I figured with hundreds of reviews, this must be a great headset.A few problems.First, they keep falling out of my ear and I have tried switching the ear buds and it doesn't seem to make a difference.Also, the bass is excessive with this head set.I actually needed to go into my iPod and put on the bass reducer."
3,"Nice, but they fall-out of my ears","These ear buds are nice in many respects, they block the noise on the bus well and are comfortable, and seem to produce good sound (although I'm not an audiophile). However, they constantly fall out of my ears. Even when I'm on the bus, they will just fall out. Maybe it is just the shape of my ears, but neither the small or large sized covers ""fit"" my ears. The only way I can get these headphone to stay in my ears is if I wear a head band or hat."
5,Very nice sound quality,"I had been using cheap earmuff type earphones, so perhaps I am not the best judge, however I love the difference in the sound quality. I am enjoying my music much more now. They arrived very quickly as well. I am very happy with this transaction."
5,good earbuds,got these and kids loved them. They said they were the best earbuds they have had. My daughter does have a hard time hearing me though when they are in. Bad for me. Good for her. lol. She says it is because they block out the outside noise which is one of their best qualities. She also says the music sounds better than ever before. Would highly recommend them!!!!
3,acceptable for the price,"it is working pretty well, as expected for a low price headphone. The build quality is fine, the sound quality is not good enough for enjoying musics though."
5,Surprisingly good sound quality,"I'm not what you'd call an audiophile, that is a person who can notice the difference between high quality sound and low quality.I bought these solely because I want to listen to videos on my laptop without disturbing others. I wanted cheap because things like these in my possession usually get lost. These were on sale for a good price just before Christmas.I do have a set of Sony headphones that got misplaced. I found them right after I received these J Buds. The Sony's were a bit more expensive but do put out a bit better sound. I think that if you are looking for a cheap set of earbuds that has fairly decent sound the J Buds are what you may like."
5,great for the price,very good for the price; would recommend easily for those on a budget. So far durable and the kids love them for their comfort
4,Very decent for its price,"These are excellent earphones for their price. I plan to use these at the gym, and in comparison to my HTC and iPhone earphones, these are a great improvement. Very comfortable, great soundstage, maybe slightly lacking in the bass area. Packaging could be a little better (come in a plastic tear bag, not bad, but not great for re-storage)."
3,Interestingly good,At first I was hesitant to get these headphones because I thought it was going to be quite uncomfortably due to my history with headphones quite similar to it but they turned out to be quite comfortable as well as doing a great job to block out background noise. Takes probably a day or so for your ears to get used to it [after having not used headphones for a while that is].
3,just ok,"ok for the price. not as ""bassy"" as the samsung pair that came with my phone, so I'll use these as back up."
3,Gets the job done,"I got these earbuds as a replacement for the crappy earbuds that Apple provides with its iPods. These earbuds feel cheap and makes an annoying sounds when you move it around in your ear. However, it gets the job done and if you need a backup set, these are good for the price."
5,Love the product - keep improving regularly,"I've been using this same model for several years; abused several pieces by using them when jogging; I still prefer this brand and can say this latest model is vastly improved from their previous ones. Great sound quality also.I highly recommend JBuds, as I'm a returning customer."
3,Great--while they last,"While the mp3 headphones work great and are good for reducing outside noise, which I need at my factory job, it does, however, not last more than six months before they have connection problems. They aren't durable. I've purchased three in a year and a half. I wish they'd last for a year's time but, alas, they are rather feeble.But for my physically demanding job they're great for six months if I'm careful with them.They stay really well embedded in my ear canal."
4,Good Sound and Isolation,Good quality sound - especially good base frequencies - and good isolation from external noise. Comfortable to wear.
5,Great quality,I am very happy with these headphones. They sound so much better than my other ear buds! Great quality for the price.
4,great headphones,"i have nothing but love for these headphones. They are TOTALLY worth the money that i spent on them. Noise reduction is great and i'm absolutely in love with them. Great sound quality,great product-hands down"
2,Nope,"short cord, trebly, hearing-reducing sound, and an ever-breaking, annoying unraveling thin cord that will drive most men insane. Maybe all ear buds suck like this except sony.I guess I had no idea how great sony was until I had to buy some replacements. Some complain about sony's ergonomic design and comfort. These people are mostly uncivilized fools who don't understand how anything works and with no functioning nerve endings. If you like ear buds for music rather than the constant annoying distraction of their existence I'd recommend those, not that I have any but the old ones I broke and are no longer made.Otherwise, silence or background noise is far preferable than these phone's tendency to constantly remind you that you are wearing them and you wasted your money on them.I think J stands for junior, so this is fine for kids who don't know any better and have no money and hear too well as it is, but not really good for you. You deserve better than that.The fit is fine."
3,Wires cracked after 3 uses,"I was thrilled with these - they fit great, sounded great (although didn't greatly reduce ambient sound) but after having them for only 3 days - one of the cords had 2 cracks in the black plastic through which I could see the silver wire underneath. They still work, but I had to wrap the cords in electrip tape where the rips were and it makes an unpleasant lump. NOT very high quality material, and it is a temporary fix, I will have to replace them very soon.UPDATE - The company - when contacted, has however promised to send a replacement within 2 business days, reviving my faith in the product. We'll see how it goes."
5,great earphones,"Everything great. I drop mine often so I can't blame the lower volume and random scratchy noise in the left ear phone on anything other than my carelessness. Fit well, the rubber keeps them in your ears fairly well when you're exercising and sweaty. They do block out the ambient sounds quite well too.EDIT:you get what you pay for. damage more easily than the j5's for example..."
3,"great sound, when they were in my ears","the earbuds were definately noise reducing and the sound was great but they didn't stay in my ear when i was at the gym, walking to the bus or even just sitting. maybe i have funny shaped ears."
3,Fairly decent for the price,"The sound quality isn't great, but it's fair enough for the price.The construction seems a bit chintsy - plastic-y, but they've actually been fairly sturdy. Again, for the price, you can't expect too much more.At least it's not the funky cord style like the sony fontopias. Decent length, too."
4,work great!,The only reason I did not give 5 stars is I also purchased the Coby CVE92 Isolation earphones and they work just as well for less than half the price - but I am very happy with these
2,great until they broke,"I thought these were great headphones. They're comfortable, have good sound, and they are easy to put in a pocket. One day, however, the right ear bud wouldn't make any sound."
3,Decent sound but doesnt fit well,good for what you pay.... these fit well in small ears but not for normal ear size... sound quality is decent...
3,Decent headphones for the price,A good step-up from the headphones that come standard with Ipod and a MUCH lower price than anything else on the market.
1,WASTE OF $$$$,"I admit--very comfortable. Wished they would have worked longer though. I play in two bands and sit in with multiple local artists, needless to say, I take good care of my equipment. About one month into use, these buds became useless when the left earphone developed a short. I also admit the sale price and other reviews did influence my purchase, but never again. I bought new ones yesterday at a local store and paid full price for another brand. They are also very comfortable."
3,broken after less than a year...,"I bought these last March; about 9 months later, they broke.The sound quality is unremarkable (they're $10 headphones...), but they're fine if you're looking for something cheap to use on the go."
4,They work better in time!,"I read all the previous reviews about these headphones, negative and positive. I purchased them because I felt for the price I really had nothing to lose. Actually, after using them for a couple of days I realized they were very good. They truly reduce outside noises and give you a good listening experience."
3,Started sounding all fuzzy when plugged in.,I got them and they seemed nice. I did notice that they didn't have as good a sound quality as the ones I got with my ipod. But they were more comfortable and much smaller which is why I ordered them. I needed something smaller and padded so I could stand to have them in my ears without being uncomfortable. So that aspect was nice. But then I noticed they started having a fuzzy connection to my IPod I need to see if I can return them or what. So I say if you have small ears good comfort quality but bad quality on the product.
2,One of the earbuds died after a month...,"Earbuds worked well at first...they muted outside noise and provided clear sound. After 6 weeks of use, one of the earbuds stopped functioning. The wires leading to each bud are quite thin, which makes me think that this is a fragile product. Not a good product for people who use them when active, i.e. working out, running, etc."
2,Caution if you have small ears....,I have small ear canals and even when using the smallest pads they would slip out of my ears. Having to constantly reinsert them was a real hassle as I walk in the mornings. The sound quality is ok but nothing special. I finally bought a pair of Koss headphones and they work much better. I cannot recommend this product based on my experiences.
2,Broke down after a month,"This does work pretty good at first...My lab work is quite loud and I needed to increase the volume to 15, but with this only max. 5...BUT it broke down after a month's use...I am very disappointed, but will try another product from a more known manufacturer."
3,"earbuds- awesome idea, works for some","some people love these things, they work really well and block out sound , however the silicone wont stay in your ears if you sweat, ie not good for the gym, which really stinks."
4,good value,"For the price they work very nicely. They do a pretty good job of reducing most amibient sound, so I don't have to turn up my volume as loud as I did with my ipod headphones."
2,"Okay, just not for me","Maybe I'm just so used to Apple earbuds that I had a hard time adjusting to these, but I just could not take to them. The fit in my ears but they felt too large or too hard or something, because after two weeks of using them they still bothered me. The noise canceling, while being nice for someone else, was also just not for me. I found it a disorienting experience since it seemed to just muffle everything around you, rather than muting it. I ended up buying the Apple ones instead anyway and gave these to my stepdad who doesn't like them eitehr."
2,Not worth the hype,"This is just another ear bud, nothing special, its in no way better than the $5 Chinese no name ear buds you can get at WalMart, so not sure what all the hype about it. Returned after 2 days."
4,Great Ear Buds,"These ear buds are great! They reduce a ton of sound, which can be both bad and good, but mostly the latter. Great deal, they work just as well as $50 ear buds for a fraction of the price."
3,"Worth $10, but nothing fantastic.","I'm glad I only paid $10, becuase these headphones aren't all that great. They work, they sound good, and they fit my ear. Thats all I wanted, and thats all I got. The bass isn't great, and the sound cancelling feature works better than just regular earbuds, but don't expect anything more than that.I would say I'm happy with my purchase since I got it for $10, had I paid more I'd feel a bit ripped off."
3,"OK, good for voice, not so good for music. Get the J2 instead.","A little muddy sounding for music. Fine for voice. As noted in other reviews, comfortable, but rubber earpieces fall off too easily.After using these a long time, I bought the J2, the next step up. I suggest you spend the extra $6 or so for those. The following are advantages of the j2 over this one:1. More flexible cord lies more naturally and comfortably.2. Noticeably better sound overall, still a little muddy on the highs.3. Longer body fits in ear further, making it more secure.4. J2 plug is narrow enough to fit the iPhone using the bumper case. The plug of this earphone set will not fit the hole in the bumper case."
3,Serves its purpose,"Upsides: Durable. Easy to take in/out of ears. Low cost. Better fit than the factory iPod earphones.Downsides: Muddy bass. Lifeless treble.I use these when I do lawn work. Therefore ""brilliant"" sound isn't to be expected as a lawnmower, weed whacker, and leaf blower are running. I would only recommend these for the budget price (mine were under $10)."
4,"Does what it says, and saves you some $$$","Overall, a very good pair of earbuds, but for the price ($10) they are outstanding! I usually think earbuds with rubber tips feel strange in my ear after a few minutes, but with the different sized cups that come with the j-buds, you should be able to find the right fit. These buds definitely cancel some outside noise, I'd say I noticed about a 50% drop in ambient noise, which is fantastic for a bus or subway where you don't want to listen to the crazy homeless guy talk to himself but still need to hear the next stop announced. Pretty good sound fidelity, especially for dialogue (I was listening to a movie once and never had to put my ipod above 20% volume). Some may complain about the quality in music, but I found the base and higher notes on Jay-Z's new album sounded great to me.Overall a great value, and perfect for a set of earbuds while traveling."
1,move on to the next product,"I had bought this product thinking after reading from previous users that the quality was pretty good for its price. Well little did i know, the headphones literally broke after the first use. I am extremely disappointed with the result of this merchandise. I rather invest my money in something that cost more then having to spend more money on replacing these headphones. UGH! frustrated!!!"
1,It was a junk,"The description of this product and the name brand made me purchase this earphones. When I received and used it, what a disappointment! It was like a dollar store earphones. I won't buy any earphones from this brand ever again."
1,Waste of money!,"Thought I was getting a good deal, boy was I wrong. The quality of sound was horrible and comfort nonexistent! They just keep falling out of your ears."
2,Not Reliable at All.,"I bought the JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black) last August. They have stopped working completely in the left ear and are only working partially in the right ear. I thought that for $20 they would last at least a year. I would like to continue using them because they are comfortable and have good sound quality but are not reliable. I have now realized that Amazon has lowered the price to $9 so it is now a partially better deal, but they are reliable as an old car battery."
1,Difficulty,Well I have mixed feelings about this headphones. They're in all regards superb for the price unfortunately I about a month after buying my first pair they broke. The left ear went dead. I thought it was just my bad luck so I bought myself another pair and low a behold a little over a month later the same problem. I tried to contact amazon and J Lab to activate my warranty. It has been over a week and I have not gotten a response from either Amazon or J Lab. So I would say avoid this product if you can not because of the product itself but because overall they're for the consumer who likes to throw money away repeatedly.Addendum: I contacted JLAB and they sent me a new pair because I was within the warranty. My opinion of these head phones has increased substantially.
2,Short lifespan,"I bought these for my ipod after the apple earbuds literally fell apart on me. I initially was very satisfied with them. They block out sound really well and were crisp and clear in quality. However, after about two months of headphone bliss, the left bud just stopped working. I couldn't see any tears in the wiring or any reason why that would be the case. I am still in the market for new headphones, but will probably try to find some that are more durable and have a longer lifespan"
4,Good Buy,"I brought this item for my daughter b/c I knew I was buying her a MP3 or Ipod this yr for X-mas, This was a great choice."
3,earbuds,"I have abnormally small ear canals, so the smallest buds barely do for me. The product is ok, my ear canals are not."
1,Absolutley No Help,I purchased headphones back in November and they broke in two days. I sent several emails with no response and am still trying to contact them. Horrible service. I wouldn't advice you to order from this company.
4,Jlab ear bud review,Package arrived quickly and was well packaged. Ear buds performed well out of the box irregardless of suggested break in period. Great sound quality (I have to keep sound almost all the way down or they're too loud). Too early to tell about durability. Silicone tips fit well and are comfortable. Would buy again and could see no real reason to purchase more expensive model (I'm a casual listener and use them with my Droid Eris phone).
4,"Good fit, good sound, good price","I just received these and popped 'em in and I'm listening to MP3s on my PC. At first, one of sides was really weak in volume. In the process of testing the balance in my software, I accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys, but that apparently did the trick. Now both are equal, and sound good.There is decent bass, but the highs are a bit soft. A quick tweak to my equalizer, and they're great. After reading several of the reviews on Amazon, I was a bit worried about the sound, but now that I have them I'm very happy. They're a good price, and sooooo much better than the little ipod-like earbuds I've tried before. Those never stayed in my ear, and the bass never made me happy.Summary:These Jbuds stay in my ear, have good sound (not great, but I think good for $20), and have equal length cords from each ear."
2,"Great Comfort, Poor Quality","Purchased these based on the price (25$ on sale) and previous reviews (mostly excellent). I have owned a pair of Grado GR60 headphones for work and home and must have gotten spoiled with good sound, because the jbuds sound extremely lo-fi. It it really hard to use them and not be constantly thinking how bad the sound is. Oh well, get what you pay for I guess.On the positive side, they are extremely comfortable."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased the JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds at the beginning of March. To be honest I purchased another pair of these last year, and they lasted almost a year to the week before the right ear bud just stopped working. I was happy with the amount of use that I got out of them, but would obviously have liked them to last longer than a year. That aside, I decided to purchase these again once my original pair died. It's an economical choice, or so it would seem. So after two months the left ear bud in the my new JBuds is already starting to fade. It is about 1/3 as loud as the other side which is supremely annoying to use (and said use is limited to 4-5 times a week max for 20 minutes to and hour). So it looks as though I'm in the market once again."
2,not the best value,If you don't mind the quality of sound from your earphones then these are right for you.
3,"Tiny, loud, good price","My only complaints are that they are so small that they tend to fall out of your ears, especially when running or working out. Also, since they sit way inside your ear, the volume gets very loud no matter what. However, I would have to say for the price that you're paying it is a very good deal"
1,Not a fan.,"Noise reduction and comfort aren't an issue, sound quality is awful, no bass at all and there is also a hollow sound."
2,Did not work with Iphone,"I bought these specifically to use with my Iphone since it said they were compatible. I'm still using the original Iphone, and these headphones did not work with it. I liked the fit and the sound when using them with other devices, but do'nt try and use these with Iphone version 1."
3,Gets the job done,Simple: you get what you pay for. These lil buds get the job done. Do not exspect Bose quality for ten bucks. You will always be disappointed.
2,Sound quality reasonable but not last long,"These earbuds got good reviews so I bought them. The sound quality was okay, reasonably balanced in terms of highs and lows. But I didn't like the scraping sound the cords made when I walked. I suppose that's a trade-off you get when you wear earbuds no matter what kind they are, though I can't verify this because I have only owned one other pair of earbuds and the other pair happened to do the same thing...perhaps others do not...????Another consideration--earbuds vs headphones--is that earbuds tangle ALL the time. This is extremely annoying. I would recommend a headset for this reason.Anyway, a wire on one of these earbuds frayed and broke after maybe six months. The wires are kind of stiff, and I suppose that's why.Though I don't think this is very important, I don't care for the pink color."
1,Not Durable at all,These headphones were cheap and working great but after only a month and a half of consistent use the left ear bud wont produce any sound. Certainly not worth the money I spent. They also popped out of my ears whenever I would run but that might be my ears and not the headphones I am not sure.
5,Best Bang for the Buck Ear Buds,"Sole purpose for purchasing these were to use when working out.Comes with 3 sets of different size ear buds. With the medium size already installed. Small is tiny for my ear, large fits pretty good; just have to wedge it in. Medium works just for me.Comparing these to my Altec Lansing noise isolating buds, these do not compare. Sound is mediocre. The bass, eh. Overall sound, eh.Just to use while working out, no big deal.Cord is pretty long, more than long enough to be honest.If you want new earbuds to actually listen to music, I guess you can get these. It's cheap, but the sound is, what I said, eh."
2,not even worth the bargain price,"I go through many earbuds so I was excited at the price and good reviews on Amazon. I used Sony $10 buds which had good clear sound but not durable and always blew a woofer after a few months. When I got these I immediately noticed the inferior sound quality comparable to what comes with sansui mp3 player. I love classic rock, metal, and alternative. These earbuds had no clarity and a lot of mid range. No highs or lows. It was a muffled jazzy sound. I also bought Seinhesser omx60 for nearly twice the price but they are outstanding and well worth it at under $20."
3,Great when they work,When i bought i was marveled at the sound quality for the price but after a year of owning them and 5 replacements the headphones don't seem as good as when i bought them. I know the replacements are free and fast but i shouldn't have to replace them every 2 months.
2,Big disappointment,i've bought these ear buds for about 1 week and half and its already wearing down.. i have to tweak the plug to make the right ear bud to put out sound..
2,"mediocre sound quality, ineffective noise reduction","These inexpensive earbuds definitely won't win any awards for sound quality, as they lack the clarity and brilliance of (say) the Sennheiser CX300-B. Also note that these are not ""noise canceling"" earbuds, but ""sound isolating""; like the Sennheisers (and the Shure series) they use a soft rubber earpiece to block out (but not eliminate) ambient noise. For whatever reason, however, the JBuds' earpieces do not seem to be as effective as those of the Sennheisers or the Shures. For this product, at least, ""you get what you pay for."""
1,Very poor sound quality,"Bought these to replace my original iPod earbuds. After 30 minutes I switched back to the earbuds -- these earbuds have no bass whatsoever and require me to turn the volume all the way up just to get a normal volume. I tried changing the inserts to give these earbuds a fair try, but they sound terrible. I will go to Radio Shack or Best Buy and buy actual Apple earbuds from now on."
1,This is why you wait to review.,"So you read all the time how someone LOVES the product they got 2 hours ago and are writing a glowing review. This is why Auto Manufacturers worry so much about ""initial quality"" and not long term quality. They are training people to love something initially and then think it is ok when it falls apart down the road and they just go buy a new one. Well if you read through the reviews you will see this in action here. Once you do a Star Rating it can't be changed. You can change the wording, but not the Stars and honestly how many people do anything more than look at the Stars. Good for JBuds, but bad for you. Like many other people I had one ear bud start buzzing after 8 or so months of gentle play. Not acceptable for such a simple product. Definitly built in failure at work here."
3,"Great Sound, Not Too Durable","I was incredibly impressed with the sound on my JBuds, particularly given the price. Sound wise, these were the best earphones I've had in a long time. The bass plays through wonderfully without negatively impacting the vocals and other instruments. The noise reduction is also very good on these. I could play my music at half of the level I needed for my other earphones and it was just right. I couldn't even hear the sound of the commuter bus I ride over it.I was disappointed with how long these lasted, though. The long length of the chord caused it to get caught on things all of the time, even the bottom pocket on my cargo pants. I've only had the headphones for a month and I'm done to one bud working part of the time. If you're used to having a longer chord, it shouldn't be that much of a problem. If you tend to get the long chord tangled up, though, look somewhere else. The sound quality is amazing, but not amazing enough to buy a new pair every month."
3,"OK, but too big for my ears.","These ear buds are OK. They sound good, but my ears are apparantly they are on the small side... if I chew or talk, they slide out. One wierd thing is that as soon as I walk outside, then I feel tiny sparks. Not much use when you want to use them outside. Not a big deal as I use them at work only."
5,Ear Buds,"Awesome, comfortable and work beautifully. Small, easy to stow in the briefcase. Another item great for commuters. No more to say."
1,Don't fit ears,"Daughter is always needing headphones... Bought these at a good price, the quality appears fine. However, they would not fit her ears and they would not fit my ears - so I have to say bad design on these in some way!"
2,not for me,The quality of these is lacking.there is much better ear buds out ther that are much cheaper and I don't recommend these at all.
2,,"I figured i'd pick up a cheaper pair of earbuds to rotate between other pairs to reduce wear etc... These jbuds defy cheap.They reduce the sound ok,but their is hardly no bass and the mid's are ok at best and that's not really saying much.For the price you get what you pay for.I recommend spending just a little bit more money and pick up a pair of the skullcandy ink'd earbuds,so far those have held up to the expectations that where expected."
2,1 month,worked for about a month then the just stopped making any sound at all. I don't suggest buying. wont last long
4,"Very good, low-priced ear buds",These are pretty good earbuds for the price. They come with 3 different sizes of foam inserts for a custom fit. They block out most of the outside noise. They don't break the bank. Now if I could just keep my ferrets away from them I'd be doing great :)
1,What a shock!,Very disappointing. My new earbuds shocked me in the ear at regular intervals. Unusable.
2,"Great Sound, bad wiring","I bought these for myself in June. I found them to be great, noise cancelling, decent range of bass and treble. BUT, after 5 weeks, I lost one channel when the wiring went bad at the jack end. The stiff piece meant to protect the wiring was so inflexible that it ended up pulling the connection loose at the jack. The cost to return and service was ridiculous, when you can just replace them for less. Too bad."
2,"Inexpensive, you get what you pay for","I guess I should have realized that when it said ""noise reducing"" and not ""noise canceling"" it really means they do neither. The ""noise reducing"" part of these head phones is the rubber shield, although I have a hunch it works better to keep the ear buds in your ear than it does to actually reduce any noise. You cannot compare these on the same day as any actual noise canceling head phones. They work, adequately, but if you want top notch sound and noise cancellation, look for something with active noise cancellation."
5,love it,Exactly what I was expecting. The color matches phone perfect and the sound is great. the price is even better!
4,Good value,"My son liked the colors, the sound, and the fit. I bought them to go with his ipod otter box that had similar colors. He was very happy with both. He wanted Beats which were too expensive but seemed to like these just fine."
4,The order came fast :),The order came within 2 days and it was what I expected.I didn't think the earphones were too comfortable though but the overall sound quality is great. Would definitely recommend it to a friend.
5,Incredibly Comfortable and High Quality to boot.,"These are by far the best ear buds I have ever owned just based on shear comfort but add in value and high quality sound reproduction you have an unbeatable product. I have fallen asleep with these buds in all night long with NO ear soreness like my Apple ear buds use to do. I cant say enough good things about them they are durable, inexpensive, high quality ear buds ENJOY..."
3,Ok Earphones for its price,Overall reasonably priced. sound quality is 3 of 5; I would get this if you do not want to spend too much on headphones and yet not get an earphone of bad quality.
3,doesn't hold up to expectations,"Bought these ear buds for my itouch after reading the reviews on them and I have to say that these ear buds fall well below my expectations. Not only are they uncomfortable but they fit poorly too. It comes with interchangeable buds for a better fit but still doesn't seem to fit right. I had others try it on and they also agreed it was uncomfortable. As for how well they sound on, I am unable to comment on that as I was not able to get pass just wearing it."
3,good while it lasted...,"i went from another pair of $20 sony ear buds to these, HUGE difference. i put these on for the first time and was blown away:-there is much more volume, i never had any problems hearing my music over loud sounds-great bass, if you're looking for bass in cheap ear buds this is it-stayed in the ears pretty well, i doubt they would stay in while doing anything like running though-extremely comfortable, i never even felt them in. they were perfect for sleeping until the wire torethe problem is the wires connected to the ear bud were torn out and now one ear bud died. this was after only two months. outside of sleeping with them on, i took good care of them. it had to have happened when i was sleeping, but that is still disappointing. i wore those sony ear buds in my sleep for 2 years and it never happened with those.in conclusion these are excellent if you're looking for cheap good quality ear buds and wont be sleeping with them on."
1,Frustrating,"These buds do not stay in your ear unless you remain relatively still. I have tried each of the three sizes of cover tips, included with the product. I have decided that I have endured enough frustration and will purchase another design similar to the mp3 ear phones that came with my player.Even if these ear buds were being given away, either the material used or the design(or both) makes them instruments of frustration."
2,meh,"I don't like giving bad reviews but don't be fooled by these good reviews (like I was)! Yes the quality of sound is fine, even good, but they suck overall because they don't stay in AT ALL. I can't even walk down the street for more than about 2 minutes before they fall out, so you constantly have to be messing with them and it's really obnoxious. Forget trying to work out with these. If you plan to remain perfectly still while wearing these then go for it, but otherwise I seriously recommend you look elsewhere."
2,They are fine as long as they lasted,"The buds were good enough acoustically and comfortable enough, but unfortunately, the right channel went out. The wire at the plug end must have broke internally because it would come back on depending on how you moved and held the cable, but now, nothing. For them to fail in under 6 months is not acceptable. Maybe that is why they are 'on sale' and they are dumping their inventory of defective product."
2,"Beware the adage, ""You get what you pay for.""","I took a chance buying these, and wouldn't have if the favorable comments hadn't been as good as they were. I made a HUGE mistake. If you LOVE your music, these are not for you: while the highs and mid ranges are okay, the bass tones are almost nonexistent--don't look for full, rich sounds from these ear phones, because you won't get them. You really DO get what you pay for."
2,You get what you pay for.... A pair of cheap Ear Buds,I purchase this Ear Buds to use them with my Ipod shuffle. My Ipod's Ear Buds where fine but they let to much outside noise in. So at the Gym that cause me a problem. In order to listen to my music I have to turn up the volume and even by doing that I keep listening to a mix of my music and the Gym music. What makes me buy this where the Noise-Reducing part but sadly this Ear Buds are so cheaply made that none of the advertise features actually work. Every part of this Ear Buds seems cheap and flimsy. I have a Sony walkman cellphone that came with a pair of Ear Buds and those are great in every sense. Even the Noise-Reducing feature works awesome I barely get any external noise even at low volume.
3,Head Phone -Noise Reducing,"Please note that these head phones work for noise reduction by being a tight fit, which is still fairly comfortable. There is no additional noise canceling functionality."
3,So so,It fells while you run. Sound is so so. I have a pair of candy skull and they sound much better that this one.You get what you paid for.
5,Fantasic bang for the buck!,"I ordered these as an inexpensive replacement for a pair of much more expensive Audio-Technica earbuds that I had to send off to be repaired/replaced. I wasn't expecting much as I slid on the rubber covers that best fir my ear canal and plugged into my iPod, but once I hit play on ""Rubber Soul"" I was blown away. The sound is outstanding; clear, not too bassy or trebly, no distortion...I'd be surprised if you can find a set of buds that sound this good at this price point. If you can, let me know. Otherwise, buy yourself a pair of these suckers at least to keep around as a spare set. I'll soon be ordering another set myself to keep in the drawer in case I find myself earbudless again. Very pleased."
2,Soldier Deployed,The cord is to short. If the cord get bent a certain way it stops being registered by the Ipod player. Cheap using during deployment and field time. I would not recommend this item.
1,JLABS does not honor warranty... (UPDATE: now they do!),"I bought my jbuds about 10 months ago and was initially quite happy with their quality. Recently one of the ear phones has stopped working --- the audio goes off and on when you move the cord around, but mostly it is off..I assume that the internal wire has frayed, and reading other reviews it seems that this is a very common problem with these ear phones.Since my jbuds are within the warranty period, I contacted the company for an in-warranty replacement, but they have ignored two emails and do not pick up their customer service line!UPDATE:JLABS has contacted me, saying that they have hired a new customer service rep and have renewed a commitment to customer service. They sent me a replacement set of jbuds with a free case and jblaster to apologize for the delay. If amazon would let me, I would now update my review to four stars."
2,JBuds,"Although the JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds do function like regular ear buds, there is nothing special about them. Despite the adjustable ear plugs, they are uncomfortable. They are worth the sale price at which I got them ($10), but not the original price."
4,Great sounding headphones,"I bought this product to use with an iPod Shuffle. I ruined the iBuds that come with the iPod by sweating into the earpieces while running. The sound quality is leaps and bounds ahead of the stock iPod earphones. When using these headphones, the clarity is so great that I hear parts of songs I've never heard before.Pros:o Low priceo Top-notch sound clarityo Deep bassCons:o The cord is too long, and becomes tangled easier than I sneezeo Not really noise canceling, they just work as earplugso Rubber earplug part also functions as earwax collector"
4,JBuds,"This is a great, reasonably priced product. It is also very frail. The sound will quit in one or the other earbuds for no reason. Sometimes this takes months. Sometimes this takes weeks."
2,"Nice Buds, if only they lasted more than two weeks","I got these for my daughter, who is an ipod addict. The noise reduction and sound were good. The noise reduction being almost too good as it was even harder than usual to get her attention when she had these on. Unfortunately, one side of the two buds died after two weeks. Fortunately, they have a one year warranty."
2,"ok sound, but didn't last","Sound quality is good, but couldn't tell any difference from a $5 Coby set. Lasted 4 months of moderate use then the left speaker was completely dead."
3,Not a great catch,I wanted some good earphones and hence decided to check in 10 bucks price range. Its not a great one but not a bad one too. It works good. Did not die for about an year now so I can say its durable. If you want to be assured of some working earphone and not worry then go ahead.******UPDATE************8One ear stopped working after about one year now.. So I take back my word! Its not a good product.. but may be a use-and-throw-in-a-year types.Sound quality was decent for as long as it lived but material quality should improve for it to last a bit longer.
3,PRETTY DECENT SOUND FOR $10,EL CHEAPO ear buds sound pretty decent consideringthe $9.95 price. Purchased as a back-up in case myBluetooth hardware/software fails.
2,not very durable,"i've barely had these for 2 months, and the right side's broken already. admittedly it was abused a bit cuz i'm kinda rough with my ipod...but nothing my original Apple buds couldn't handle."
2,Meh.,"Sound quality is mediocre, noise-reduction is laughable. That being said, I got them for 10$ (normal msrp is 49.95$) so I got what I paid for but had I paid full retail I would have returned them. Panasonic makes a set of ear buds similar to these for around 30$ that are a thousand times better and available at most electronics retailers, just get those."
1,broken within 2 months,The jbuds are comfortable but the rubber pieces constantly fall off. The wires are too long and get tangled. The wiring frayed after only 2 months of use so now I can only get sound out of one earpiece. I do NOT recommend this product.
3,Ear buds in general are not designed for running,"Sound is good enough - I am no expert in professional sound. If you are looking for buds to run with, find something that attaches around the ear. One mile into a 10K I was fooling with the buds trying to get them back into place. Once I started sweating, forget about it. Spent more time trying to get them right, even having the three different sizes. They fit great for walking around the neighborhood, but the simple swinging of the cords (until I fed them under my shirt) wiggled the buds loose."
3,Sony is better!,To me the JBuds are a cheap version of the Sony earbugs. I not only want to hear my music... but I also want to feel my music...bass through treble!
1,broke within an hour,I bought these presumably 80% off . I hadn't used them for an hour when one earbud failed and now the plug won't make the connection unless i twist it to find just the right place it connects--and then don't move. Sound quality is not a factor when there is no sound. Bottom line-worthless. I should have listened to the other reviewers who indicated they were poorly made.
1,scratchy sound out of the box; terrible,These ear buds did not work well; they were scratchy and the music came through unclear. Do not buy these! It was not worth my hassle to try and return a $15 product....probably cost me $9 to return...
1,Just Awful........!!!,"After using a pair of SkullCandy for awhile, I decided to try something better. Well, these didn't fit the bill. No bass response, tinny highs, and plenty of static. The overall sound was similar to listening to music through blown-out speakers. I'm using a Zen mp3 player, and tried to adjust the sound with the custom equalizer, but it could not overcome the short-comings of these ear buds. The comfort and fit was OK, but I could hear much of the outside noise getting into my ear canal. The bottom line is, nothing was positive or redeeming about these ear buds. I gave them one star since they existed to try, but after a week, in the trash they go. I won't try another JBuds product, due to the complete disappointment in these."
1,save your money,"Bought this for the gym to use while watching news and sports. The buds are OK. But reception is hit and miss. Lose signal completely. More frustrating than anything else. Got so bad I don't even use the radio anymore. The original phones were good, but cumbersome in the gym. Buds work better than phones, but not these. Bought again for the price, it was a sellout at half price, and got burned once again. Save your money!"
3,Acceptable quality,"I recently bought this pair of headphones to replace a pair of JBud J3's. I love the J3 model - I found that they effectively blocked out much of the metro (subway) noise so that I could listen to podcasts on my commute; unfortunately, they broke (an earpiece came apart) after less than a year, so I thought I'd give this model a try. While less expensive, the J2 sound just as good, but don't block any noise, so I can't use them for my commute. I think they'd work great for quieter environments - the quality appears good. I'm contemplating getting another pair of J3's and just expecting to replace them in the future."
4,JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black),"The product lives up to it's name. The noise was greatly reduced for a great sound quality. I had to continually adjust the ear pieces to stay firmly in my ears, but I struggle with all ear pieces."
3,Tone Depth,Tone seems to have less depth of bass than other inexpensive ear phone sets that I have purchased in the past.
2,Didn't last long.,"They sounded pretty good at the beginning but it wasn't long before that changed. The sound quality started going fast, and the cheap construction showed up in the fact that they started to literally fall apart. I wasn't abusing them or overworking them or anythiing and I believe they should have stood up better than they did. I wouldn't waste my money on them. There are better buds out there."
1,better earbuds available for less,"I purchased a pair of these earbuds and at the same time purchased a pair of Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones head phones. These cost twice as much as the paid of Coby, so I had higher expectations. Unfortunately these earbuds failed to deliver the same quality that I received through the Coby earbuds. These earbuds played music as a lower volume and did not seem to have the same range as the other pair. What I found very interesting is how the two earbuds appear almost identical with the only difference being the name badge attached and the color. I would not recommend these earbuds."
4,Not bad for the money,"I lost it a day after I received it but the few times I used it before I lost it, was worth the money. Not bad! I may buy another soon."
1,Horrible headphones!!!!!!!,"These headphones were recommended by Cnet not to mention several other reviews that I read on Amazon which led me to believe that these would be a viable alternative to my Zune Premium in-ear buds (which sounded PERFECT). Boy was I disappointed!! The largest ear mushrooms are barely adequate to keep the buds from falling out of my ears. And the sound is absolutely terrible! It sounds like a horrible monotone alarm clock radio. They're loud, no doubt but the sound quality is below bad. Now I'm stuck with these cheap decroded pieces of crap until my replacement Zune Premium headphones arrive. I should have ordered those in the first place but I am in Iraq and don't want to mess up a ""good"" pair of headphones. Stay away from Jbuds."
4,Good earbuds for the money.,Good earbuds for the money. Very comfortable with changeable ear inserts. Good value for the price.
5,Excellent choice for those with smaller ear canals,"My 14-year-old daughter has ear canals that are smaller than usual. The earbuds that come with Ipods and most other commercially available earbuds are too wide to fit comfortably in her ears--in fact, she says they hurt her ears. The Jbuds are the exception. They come with 3 different sizes of ear inserts (small, medium, large). The small ones fit her ear canals comfortably, and, just as importantly my daughter thinks they look cool."
4,Quality Headphones,"Great headphones for the price. I highly recommend these because of their sound quality and because they block outside noise. Although there is no active noise blocking, the rubber pieces on the headphones create a seal in your ear that really does stop outside noise. The bass is deep and the mids and highs are clear. They are also very comfortable. I can wear them during a 2 hour workout or a long flight and forget that I'm wearing them. They stay in my ears well for buds. but jolting from running sometimes dislodges them. I highly recommend these."
3,JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Buds for iPod (Black),Falls out of your ears easily even came with different sizes but they are all the same not worth the money. Won't stay in ears for more than 5 minutes if you are moving arouond.
3,Earbuds fall off,"Was on a business trip and one of the earbuds fell off. Very frustrating. When the earbuds are on, they work great and I love them however. 3 stars ***"
5,Excellent Sound Quality for Price,For the price you cannot beat these ear buds. Much better than the Ipod buds provided with purchase and more comfortable.
3,"Good price, fits good but almost too much bass","I purchased these on amazon for $20.00 and I have to say, for the price, they are a pretty decent pair of buds. I use them all the time because they fit great. The wires do get tied up a little but for the price, I would say good deal."
5,Better than Apple headphones,"Great deal. These headphones are much more comfortable that the standard issue Apple headphones. The soft headphone piece can be replaced with two other sizes. Since they fit better, the bass response is better. Also, they do reduce ambient noise. They are not noise cancelling but the do cancel enough outside noise to get you in the zone without complete sensory deprivation. Highly recommended. Note: I have not compared these to the models costing $100 or more. I still say save your money & buy these."
4,Excellent Sound,"I can't complain about the sound quality as it's pretty incredible for the price and it gets an A+ for comfortability. I just can't find any earbuds that feel as comfortable in my ears as these. I seriously forget I'm wearing them, they're that comfortable. But I will say that the durability needs improvement. No matter how I care for them, one ear always dies within 2 or 3 months and it's an absolute pain. I wish the quality of the overall product could be improved. I wouldn't even mind paying an extra few bucks if they could just fix the durability so that I could keep them longer! I have earbuds with worse sound quality and they last twice as long so I'm sure it can be resolved. Either way, product is decent and deserves a 4 star rating."
1,bad quality,"very bad in quality, sound, and fitness.I don't recommend it, it doesn't worth even a dollar.And it was broken within two weeks only. BTW no Noise reduction at all."
1,You can do better,"Some of the reviews for these headphones are pretty good. I was surprised, then, to get them in the mail and find them to be unsatisfactory.The sound is very thin and lifeless--I had to use the EQ settings on my iPod to get anything remotely decent-sounding out of the headphones. Switching to any of the three included earpiece sizes didn't make a difference. Most shocking of all was the realization that the headphones that came with my iPod (free, essentially) sounded vastly superior.Worth $20? I'd say no."
2,Cheap for a reason,"These ear buds seemed good for the price but once I started using them I realized why the were so inexpensive compared to the other noise reducing ear buds the workmanship on them is pretty bad the wiring very low quality, after a week the connection started messing up and I have to bend the wire to be able to hear anything the sounds is not too bad again for the price but could be better. These earbuds are not worth it their manufacturing quality is very bad and you will be buying new earbuds in a few months."
3,Overrated....but usable.,"These sound terrible, and the noise reduction is minimal. Right now as I type here at the coffee shop, I took out the JBuds because I could hear the people talking next to me, and put in the Koss Plug headphones in my bag...the Plugs are WORLDS better...just sucks to have to squeeze them to put in ears, but now worth it, compared to the bad sound and noise reduction of the Jbuds. If you love bass as I do, and full-sounding music, then stay far away from these. For about the same price, I'd recommend the Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia or the Koss Plug headphones...better bang for the buck in my opinion."
4,the most comfortable earbuds that I have ever tried,I have medium sized ears but other earbuds that I have tried were either very uncomfortable or kept falling out. These seem to fit perfectly! Sound quality is not great but I think the great fitting of these earbuds makes up for that.
1,Where's the Treble,While I do like the in the ear plunger approach to block unwanted sounds around you...I must admit I am very disappointed. The treble was non existant. I don't believe the manufacturer's range claims. Try turning the bass all the way up and treble all the way down in you car...that's what you'll get. Back to my old reliable Sony earbuds (took about 30 seconds to make that decision) for my nano.
3,Good but not great...,"I bought these earphones after reading the reviews and pretty much knew what to expect....These earphones are not all that great but pretty OK for the cost...I needed a pair which i could carry around for rough use...(gym, travel) and these suit the purpose quite well..."
4,It's a good product,"I bought the earphones in January 2007 and use them regular during a train commute and while exercising. I found the quality of sound to be excellent and better most other models I have used. It is also nice to be able to fit the different size ear buds depending upon the shape of your ear. My only complaint is that, unlike some other shaped earphones, these buds tend to fall out of my ears when they get sweaty I am running. Otherwise, they work quite well."
2,Very disappointed.,"Since I was having trouble getting the iPod ear buds to stay in my ears, I was very excited after reading the review on these Jbuds. I tried each of the three cushion sizes and they all still popped out of my ears. After trying for a month, I have gone back to the original iPods ones that came with my iPod."
3,Just another mediocre earbud,"It's true that they fit well & feel quite comfortable. But the sound quality is mediocre and fairly dimensionless. Overall, these are just another pair of $20 earbuds...actually they are probably worth $30 (but not one cent more). If you are picky about sound quality, keep looking."
4,JLab earbuds are so much better than iPod earbuds,"The standard-issue iPod earbuds hurt my ears and wouldn't stay in. JLab earbuds fit, are comfortable and the sound is great... The price is reasonable, too..."
3,Good sound and very comfortable,"They sound great for how much they cost, and they're so comfy I hardly notice I have them in my ears.Update: Fell appart at the seam after some use. Still comfortable, but not very usable since every time I pull them out of my ears the front half separates from the back and the wire is exposed."
1,Poorly made,I should've listened to the other bad reviews. Used for 1 month and already lost sound from one ear. I actually think its a problem with the plug. I will go back to my cheaper Creative ear buds that have lasted me years
4,Good Value,"This is a great value for $10-bought it for my iPhone4s. It's a third the price of J4's and a tenth of Bose earbuds. Wouldn't use it on my Bose Lifestyle system, somewhat tinny,but excellent for smartphones,Kindle Fire."
1,Why doesn't anybody produce earbuds that last?,Only lasted a couple months. Then one went out. I've bought many different sets of earbuds off amazon and always find myself having to buy more. I was hoping that this brand would last but they are just like everything else.
1,Broken in 2 days.,"They were pretty good, then after 2 days of use they died. Horrible waste of money. Do not buy. 15 dollars gone."
4,Great Earbuds,"I bought these earbuds because I have tiny ear canals and couldn't find comfortable earbuds before. These come with 3 different sized earbud tips and the small ones actually fit!! They are not noise-cancelling, but they might as well be. I had them on and I was being called for from another room and did not hear the person shouting. They are a great buy and are priced very reasonably. You will not regret this purchase!"
2,good sound -- shorted out in 4 months,Sounded pretty good for the price. But shorted out in 4 months. I am an adult who takes reasonable care with products of this nature.
5,Worth the price,"I think, for earbuds, they're a bit pricey, but it's worth it. They cancel noise in an odd way, where you don't hear background noise, but if you focus on a voice you can still hold a conversation. The sound quality is the best I've found in earbuds (the bass is amazing!), and it comes with three sizes of inserts, so they fit well."
2,Another one bud failure,"While the audio quality was good, keeping in mind the price, my JBuds suffered from the classic one bud failure. After only five months of use, one of the buds failed. But while it lasted the audio quality was not at all bad."
3,"love the sound, not the wires","I love the sound quality and bass in these, but one of the wires(which are too long) frayed at the part that joins the earpiece. I bought another brand and didn't like the sound quality so I returned them. I will think about buying these again, but the wires should be shorter and stronger where they join the earbuds. The company should replace them under warranty since it is normal wear. I'll see if they respond positively."
3,Ok until they broke after 6 months of light use.,"I liked the sound and comfort of these just fine, but after less than 6 months of use (3 times/week at the gym only), one side went out. So much for the decent price."
2,Phenomenal sound for cheap but...,"These earbuds worked amazingly well. For about 2 months. Then the jack suddenly stopped working, and I had to wiggle the jack to get sound at all, then I only got sound in 1 ear.Great sound, and overall, I think they were worth the money ($2 per week, about), but I will not purchase a new set."
2,Nice ear buds until they died....,"I had owned these earbuds for just over a month and ending up throwing them out. They worked quite well at first, especially considering they were only $10. After about 3 weeks, one of the earbuds kept cutting out and about a week later it just went out completely. I did like them, but I would not buy $10 earbuds every month."
4,Cheap but effective,"I bought these to replace my year old jbuds as the stereo stopped working on them. I have a pair of [[ASIN:B001RB24TG Sony MDR-XB20EX 9mm High Sensitivity Driver Extra Bass EX Earbuds] and the sound quality is a little better, but because of the long piece coming down from the bud, they are not very stable when walking/jogging. I use them with my Android tablet (and they were free with Sony rewards points). The jbuds are very comfortable in my hard-to-please ears, and they stay put. The sound is better than average. The only reason these got 4 stars instead of 5 is because they changed the plug from 90 degree angle to straight. The right-angle plug fit into my pocket better."
4,Go for it!!!,"I had lost my earphones to me ipod... so i had to buy new ones. i really like these ones, they are very comfortable, and i can wear them without worrying that they are going to fall out of my ears. i always have problems with ear phones, they never fit my ear comfortably... but these are the best i have worn esp for the low price. the only thing is that the cord gets tangled easy...which can be annoying, but i think just about all of them do... i would recommend this product. its comfortable, great price, and works. With this product too, the outside sound is reduced. i say go for it!!"
2,cheap and very disposable,"I've purchased two of these as replacement headphones for my IPOD classic. The price and sound quality were initially appealing but the first pair lasted 4 months, and the 2nd pair lasted just over three months. I've had several pair of IPOD-supplied earphones and they lasted 8-9 months. The problem in all cases is one side becomes unreliable and then goes altogether as the connection between the plug and wire fails. Having to replace them every 3-4 months means even that inexpensive price really is not a good value."
4,great earphone,I am just trying to get used to this and i think it has been working good and the sound quality is great
2,"Good, but won't stand the test of time","I've bought a couple of these over the years.They are good, sound good, fit snuggle in your ear with the interchangeable ear pieces.My main complaint is that they do stop working over time. The first pair I had stopped working after 6 months. One day the volume just went out completely in one ear. It was so cheap i bought another one.The second pair has lasted 1 year, but now, it too has stopped playing volume out of one earbud.I suppose that's not bad use, for 1 year, but it's kinda annoying to replace something every year that should seemingly last longer.Long short of it: don't buy these unless you are ok replacing them after a year, or if you are deaf in one ear."
3,"The book has its values, but also got serious problems","Most of other reviewer think highly of this book. I also agree, to a certain extent, that the book's is valuable and fill in the gap between ""talks"" and ""walks"".However, there are two things I have to point out: One, the editing/basic correctness check of this book is kinda terrible. For example, P72 on Particle Swarm Optimization, the 4.2 formula is obviously WRONG and not consistent with the rest of discussion. Also on P74, the position vector calculation is wrong as well: it also seems the author/editor cut & copy two blocks of text.Second, I don't like is the lack of explaination on certain important notations and equations, which is very important to be at least ""self-contained"" for such a ""cover everything"" book. For example, P210 on reinforcement learning, Equation 9.2 has a general explaination of what it is, but non of those notation/symbols in the equation make sense in the context.So, in general, be aware its pro and cons."
2,Not very clear,This book covers a good range of topics but fails to deliver the topics in a clear and concise manner. Not to mention there are many typos (including incorrect and incomplete equations). He also tries to give large examples where a small example would be more suitable. He also does not finish some of the examples (such as the A* method example).
3,"Decent introduction, insane amount of typos","I feel bad saying this, but -- the book's goals and structure are great, and the author definitely put in a good effort to make this book. However, there are way too many errors and typos in this book (as some of the other reviewers noted).The code is fairly easy to read, and (to date) I have not found any errors in example code... but in terms of the actual 'writing', that's a whole different story. Formulas are missing halfs, inconsistencies in variable usage, it's seriously bad. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, or maybe I got a bad edition (didn't buy from Amazon), but it looks exactly like the one listed (softcover, 2nd ed)..If you're fairly proficient at C/C++ code, however, you should be able to follow the book ok... just expect to be reading more of the source code than the actual writing, half the time.It was a required textbook for a class."
4,Has some mistakes... but not for long,"This book is a great idea. I am enjoying reading it and working through the examples. I get hooked on each topic, and I find myself absorbed in learning the algorithms and playing with the code. The code is readable, and the author explains the code well.Unfortunately, there are some errors in this book. I originally complained in my review about not having found any errata on the publisher's site. It turns out they are there now. Last I checked, you get to the errata from the main page, not from the book's page. I am corresponding with the author about some errors that haven't been caught yet. He has been very responsive.Once the errors get caught and fixed, this will be an amazing book. I don't know of any other quite like it."
5,Great book for engineers,"I enjoyed this book. It is written at a level that can sink my teeth into without too much concentration on statistical mathematical equations all over the page. The algorithms he chose to cover were very interesting as well.I wish it had been implemented in Java, but it was a simple matter to transfer them over.I sure would like to see a Java based sequel that goes a bit deeper into these topics.Thanks Tim"
2,not really what I was searching for....,"I suppose this book would be good for those wanting at best a cursory glance at the world of AI (I applaud the author for the breadth of material covered), but for those looking for any practical grounding into AI, this book falls sadly short. There are examples in each chapter, but it seems that what theory is explained is just barely enough to get you by to understand them.I though the book would be more in-depth. Plus there are several annoying math slip-ups."
3,Important History,"I had a great uncle who went to Haiti with the Marines in 1916 so I was glad to see a recording of this history that might otherwise be lost. The book provides important contextual information on Dominican politics at the time. It does describe as ""bandits"" Dominicans who fought the Marines that I'm sure the Dominicans consider to be freedom fighters. The document itself looks like it was printed on a typewriter and the photos are a bit grainy and blurring."
5,One of my all-time favorites.,"I have loved this book ever since I first read it back in 1985 when I was in the 6th grade. I still read it now and then at age 37, it's one of those books I love on a rainy day with my robe and slippers on and sitting in my comfy wing chair. :)"
4,Very clean looking system that sounds great.,"Picked this up for a replacement for the living room stereo. Clarity is excellent, the speakers (come with stands) look greatand the setup was easy. I've had a few other HTIB systems and this is one of the best to date. The subwoofer could be a little better (6"") but thats a minor issue. Has a 5 disc changer, FM/AM tuner built-in and plays CDRW,DVDRW+/-, etc."
1,Won't buy JVC brand products again,It's November 22nd and the Home Theater just doesn't work. The CD trays don't open. I'm going to try to get customer service hel. I'll write down later how it went.
2,Fun while it lasted,"When we first installed this system, I was thrilled with the outcome. But now we have had it almost 6 months and we have to turn the volume WAY up to hear the dialogue. Then something loud happens in the soundtrack and the whole bloody sound system shuts off.When I reported this to JVC service, they suggested I take my system to an authorized repair center. Apparently the closest one is 800 miles away in Georgia. So even if I ship it to them, the shipping costs alone don't justify the expense. Not to mention the hassle of dismantling and re-installing the whole thing.I guess I'll buy something else. Very disappointing."
1,Not what is advertised,"Picture from the merchant BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES, shows the PDI brand of Antiseptic Wipes.What I received was an unknown Chinese brand. Use at your own risk."
2,Mystic Beanie Baby,"I ordered this item thinking I'll be getting the Mysic with the brown horn, which looks better than the foil looking one. Unfortunately I unened up with the foil looking one, not what was in the picture, and this one isn't that good looking so I'm not happy with that, but you can't go too wrong with a Beanie Baby."
5,The REAL Soundtrack!,"O.K. first of all nobody should be surprised that Eminem is not on this CD. All you have to do is look at the back of the case (or if you buy it online, look at the track listing) and it tells you what artists are on this CD. This is a great compilation of mid-90's hip-hop tracks (for those of you who didn't know the movie takes place in 1995). And another thing that you should know, ""Temtations"" by 2pac is not on this CD there are only 12 songs. And there are other songs that should be on this CD like ""Who Shot Ya"" & ""Players Anthem"" that where in the movie, but even without those songs this is still one of the greatest soundtracks of all-time. And even though I do already own some of the CD's that these songs are taken from, it's nice to have them all on one disc (very convenient). So anyone that is a fan of mid-90's hip-hop or if you were feelin' the songs in the movie you should definitely pick this up!"
4,Almost....but no cigar.,"Ok, let's ignore the CDNOW editorial review for a moment and focus our attention elsewhere for a moment (because if I hear one more comment dubbing the Notorious B.I.G the greatest lyricist of all time, I'll get sick) This album shares some of the better hip hop (and hit pop in other cases)tracks from the 90's. I would have preferred a mix of some of the greatest lyricists of all time on this album (rakim, krs, etc) in place of some of the tracks but overall....if ya don't have the individual albums already, it might be wise to relive the 90's with this one!!"
4,Take yourself back,This is a good album to get if you don't have the classic Hip Hop cuts of the mid 90's. Its a good way to get hold some of the older tunes that you might not have on one compliation
4,here we go....,"Firstly, as said if you are a hip-hop fan you SHOULD have these cd's already! They are all essentials for your collection. Secondly, if you are looking for new em this aint the one, but, dont turn off there!! I think that many people are missing the point of this SOUNDTRACK (thats right people this is a soundtrack), it is meant to showcase the music from the movie which it does quite well with classic tracks from classic artists from the rap generation before eminem.People are forgetting that the original '8 mile' soundtrack does not appear that influentialy throughout the movie (with the exception of lose yourself & 8 mile)but for those that think that eminem IS rap... prepare for an education. Get this disc and learn about what it used to be like and then have some fun along the way!!Highlight tracks would be 'shook ones', 'juicy', 'all i need' and 'c.r.e.a.m'"
5,Some great 90's rap,"In the early to mid 90's while I was still in the single digits I was heavy into rap & r&b and this album is a great throwback to the music scene I was into. Sporting some great rap anthums by the likes of BIG, Tupac & Naughty by Nature, this 'more music from' album really delivers the goods. The music featured here are all tracks that here hot back in the day, the time period this film hails from. This is the best of the 90'd rap scene including opening and closing tracks by Mobb Deep and some classic tracks by Method Man (the greatest rapper alive) and the rest of Wu Tang including ODB. My inly regret is that there aren't more tracks...and as was stated by other reveiwers, there are about 6 key tracks played in the film that are not here...but then again, licensing is so crazy that getting the rights to use certain tracks can be downright impossible at times. Even though, this is still one classic album and a must own for any fan of the hip-hop genre."
3,That dude jjb(or whatever),"Hey jjb... not sure what your nick was, but u said that everyone that bought this CD was wack or something.. Because if they were a true hip hop fan they should have owned all these song from way back.. But did you ever think of that peolple might just have gotten in to listning to rap or that they weren't even 6 years old when some of these songs were released.. If somebody wants to listen to songs that used to be hot before, I say do it.. If you really like hip hop, it's cool that they listen to ""old""(its not that old) skool.. I only own records with 2pacs and BIG's songs, but I still appreciate the other songs and the album.. for example when you listen to songs or whole records by Grand Master or run DMC you are allowed to do so without being wack! For all of ya.. When you get a chance to hear old skool songs DO SO, AND ENJOY!!"
3,3.8 STARS,"This CD is'nt too bad. It has some very good songs like ""shook ones"" by Mob Deep. (Even though I don't like Mob Deep its pretty good) There is also ""playa's ball"" by outcast, ""Juicy"" by BIG, that track featuring Mary J. Blidge and Method Man, and some other pretty good tracks. THIS IS NOT THE CD WITH ""LOSE YOURSELF"" BY EMINEM. As a matter of face, not one song on this contains Eminem. If you are looking for the one with Lose yourself, I definitely reccomend getting the 1st original 8 Mile soundtrack."
3,"eminem aint doin this rap biz.,.......he is doin the pop biz",eminem is a pop star who tries to be famous.....he successed...as being a pop star....but not a rap star
2,Coleman Woodsman Chair,"It's lightweight and the price is right. Those are the only pro comments. The chair is very uncomfortable, especially the back. The back is way to far back to support at all. Overall I expected more for a Coleman product. Not satisfied."
5,Great chair for picking,"This is the best chair out there for Bluegrass pickers! You can't play instruments in chairs with arms... so these are perfect. I take a couple with me to festivals, jams, or the like. They are extremely light and well made and have lasted multiple festival seasons.As the other reviewers have pointed out, there are more comfortable chairs out there... but these are not that bad and the only choice for certain applications."
3,"Light and fairly durable, but not too comfy.","I backpack a lot, and i have owned 2 of these chairs now. The first one wore out (the seat ripped all the way across) after about 10 weeks in the backcountry, which is a pretty good amount of time for the rough use that it saw. This is a very lightweight chair, weighing just under 2 lbs, and is easy to strap to my pack. After a couple of weeks of use, the back cloth panel stretches out too much to be of any use. You have to lean back so far that it is uncomfortable. After the back stretches out, i use it mostly for hanging my jacket, hat or radio. The alluminum construction is very strong, and the hinges and posts were all in good shape after 10 weeks of solid use. If you are handy, you could sew a new piece of cloth for the seat fairly easily, as that is the piece that wears out."
1,Backrest poorly designed,"I was looking for a lightweight chair to take backpacking. I am very disappointed in the backrest on this model. It is way too far back to be useful. I am working on jamming something next to the pivot to provide more support. Too bad, because the design is so simple and light."
1,"Coleman Woodsman Chair, back is poorly constructed","This chair has very little back support, due to both stretchy material on the back and the angle of the back is not upright enough (leans back too far). The end result is you're leaning back too far to be comfortable, at least for me at 145#."
2,not enough back support. I returned it.,Have two much older coleman chairs that have a padded backrest. I wish Coleman still made and sold those.
1,Sloppy and Schlocky,"Questionable scholarship along with an obvious desire to make a little supplemental income leaves this ""work"" wanting."
1,Worst movie ever made? Read Guardian article...,"A recent article in the Guardian (excellent UK newspaper) featured this film prominently when assessing criteria for ""The Worst Film Of All Time"".The journalist's name is Joe Queenan. I suggest you do a web search on the article - it's absolutely hilarious.Showgirls has some competition!"
1,Worst film ever made,There a reason why no saw this. Becaues it is incomprenhable. It makes little sense and is poorly acted by Kristofferson. The movie reall could have cut to about twevlve seconds. Any one who liked this film is a moron and has no sense of what good film making is either. I write Reviews for the long Island Youth Film Society
2,Boring Boring movie,This one of the worst movies ever made.The plot is boring andyou can't hear the sound of the actors very well.I gave these2 stars for Christopher Walken performance and the wonderfulphotography by Vilmos Zsigmond.
5,Give it a chance already!,"Criterion once again presents a movie unjustly treated upon release in a beautiful edition. Great image quality and a fascinating movie. It's slow, yes, but don't expect a fast-paced traditional Western and you should appreciate it."
5,Good western,Most folks say this is overblown and not to good.Some people think this is all show and no go.They are wrong. This is a solid western epic.Great action.
4,An under appreciated work,"I must admit, when I sat down to watch this 4 hour epic, I expected the worst. Being familiar with film and one who reads a great deal, I was well aware of the universal vitriol that this movie received when released way back in 1980. I was, however, surprised and slightly angered that this film was so badly received. It contains luscious, panoramic cinamatography, breathtaking meticulously detailed costumes and sets and mesmerising, almost dreamlike acting by it's 3 stars. I think it was due to Cimino's take on American history that provoked such a negative response. It derides the American Dream as one of mutual compromise and discreteness. Quite interestingly, this movie is rated quite highly by British and European critics."
5,A masterpiece,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. I had watched it years ago in movie theaters in Paris and I wanted to watch it again. It is as good as I thought. The images are beautiful, the actors are great. Of course it is slow, of course it is more than 3 hours long, but this is a magnificient story. Do not miss it if you do not know it and watch it again if you have already...The story is not too far from the great book ""A People's History of America"" by H. Zinn. It shows the losers' view of history. But it is not sad, it is beautiful. Do not miss it."
1,SNORE!,"Wow, this is truly the most boring movie I have ever seen. Cimino deserves all the criticism. I usually dont put much stock in ""critics"" analysis of these outcast films and I fell for some of the recommendations and bought the DVD. Big mistake. And I love Walken and Kristofferson, the later in his prime. Not enough to save this pig and not worthy of further comment. It's as bad as the critics said. I will give the director credit for his dedication to authenticism and visually this movie is special. They should have used all the money they poured into this dog to buy a decent script. Horrible."
1,Boring's Gate,"Hard as it must have been to make Wyoming's Johnson County War boring, these people managed to find a way."
2,heaven's gate,critics hated it but what the hell do they know?i found this to be a v.ery good tale of a forgotten part of the history of greed and bigotry in america.
3,This film is screaming for a quality Blu-Ray release!,"I never knew what reviewers were saying about a poor transfer from film to DVD until I watched this DVD. They must have used a poor quality print to transfer to DVD, as more than 50% of the film is nearly all brownish. The wonderful roller skating scene is ruined in the middle by a nearly sepia print. The transition between one reel and another is jarring, from a brownish color to more full color. The quality after the ""Intermission"" is full of tape edits and blue dots on the print. I know there is a better quality print out there: I saw it on Turner Classic Movies!Let's hope someone uses what TCM used and makes a Blu-Ray."
3,Puzzling and Beautiful...,"It seems to me that Cimino was doing everything in his power to make the greatest Western ever committed to celluloid. ""Heaven's Gate"" is nowhere near as bad as critics have said. Likewise, it is nowhere near as good as it could've and should've been. It could very well have been the greatest Western of all-time, considering its scope and story. Huppert, Kristofferson, Bridges, Walken, Hurt and Brad Dourif all turn in spectacular performances. The cinematography is legendary as expected from a lenser like Zsigmond (who also shot what IS the greatest Western ever - ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller""). Simply put: the soundtrack is sometimes unintelligible, the editing is sometimes too lenient, the script is (in places) far too hazy. I admire Cimino, but he is a far better director than screenwriter - he would have been wise to let another writer final draft his script. ""Heaven's Gate"" is a good movie, but it deserved to be unmatched."
3,Heaven's gate,"I ordered the DVD of Cimino's masterpiece as soon as I knew it was to be released, but alas I should have waited. I know that Heaven's Gate is meant to have a sepia-toned feel ( I was responsible for getting the BBC's print of the film acceptably transferred to tape some years back ) but the grading here is bizarre to say the least. At times it looks truly magnificent and at others ( such as Chapter 22, directly after the famous and titular skating scene ) it looks like washed monochrome covered in dirt. There's no detail, no subtlety and the change from the interior to exterior is SO shockingly terrible that it just makes me think that I wasted my money. It's a real shame, because - as the DVD liner notes state - Heaven's Gate is a 'Visual masterpiece'. Well it should be, but not on the strength of this mastering. Shame on you MGM."
2,"Scissors and earplugs, please!","The actors were often great. The story line COULD have been compelling. The cinetography was lovely although at times too dark (literally!). But I kept on thinking ""OK, *this* scene made its point 5 minutes ago, and it is WAY TOO LOUD to boot."" I kept having to ask my husband to turn down the sound, because it became so irritating. I wanted to get into the story and the characters (and I'm quite OK with ambivalent, 'real' people who are good and bad and endearing and annoying all in one film) but I found that the neverending scenes drained my interest and drove me into the kitchen to do dishes. Could not the director have edited just a tiny bit and still preserved the complexity?! As for huge noisy crowd scenes - a little goes a LONG way.We both liked Jeff Bridges the best."
1,Not a movie,"I had a hard time making it through the last half of this DVD even at 128X. In the ""film as art"" world, there is subtle and there is nonexistent. Heaven's Gate, as anything beyond a monument to it's own excesses, is 4+ hours of nonexistence.Even given all of this film's glaring missteps, Cimino might still have blundered his way through like he did with The Deer Hunter, but for one fatal stroke - Kris fricking Kristopherson. What the hell was Cimino thinking? Were Buck Owens and Roy Clark busy that week? And who the hell ever told Kris Kristopherson that he could act? Repeatedly, in the midst of it's soft focus cinematic splendor, we are made to watch Kris Kristopherson mugging at the camera like a minor league ballplayer doing a commercial for a discount carpet outlet. I'm sorry, but there's just some sh_t I will not eat..."
1,Ridiculous,"Not only is this movie completely inaccurate historically (both Jim Averil and Ella were hanged by ""regulators"" for starters, but that's only the beginning of the colossal betrayal of history in this film), it is so contrived and boring as to be too painful to watch. The endless scenes of screaming immigrants were beyond tiresome. The violence against women and children during the ""war"" scenes was obscene and completely made up...few were killed in this ""war"" (the movie has a cast of thousands dying), and the only women's death I know of was a hanging. I'm so tired of Hollywood's messaging...why can't we have honest Westerns, or stories of any genre without all the arrogant self-indulgence of crusading idiots."
1,If I could rate it at Zero stars I would,I have never been able to find anything worthwhile in this film after two attempts to watch it. Just a terrible film period.
2,Very flawed - with glimpses of the very good film Cimino must have imagined,"Very flawed - no doubt - but there are glimpses of the very good film Michael Cimino must have seen in his imagination. There's also the opportunity to learn from many, many errors of others if you ever decide to make a big-budget western."
3,Not nearly so bad as you've heard,"This is a flawed movie, but it has redeeming qualities. Kris Kristofferson does a pretty good acting job. The woman who plays his love interest does a very good job too, plus she's got a couple nude scenes which are nice. In fact, the acting is quite good throughout. The movie is very long, and best taken in chunks. The sound is muddled. The editing is vexing. The plot is difficult to follow. The final battle scene doesn't make any sense. The ending is confusing and unsatisfying. However, the cinematography is great. There are some set-piece scenes which are pretty fun. And a few interesting surprises. Taken as a series of vingettes instead of as a whole, it's actually got some real heart.A woulda shoulda coulda epic that didn't quite make the cut."
2,More background info on the movie...,"Those interested in reading more about it, I have found 2 hard-to-get books covering the making of the film:(1) Final Cut by Steven Bach in which the author, a studio exec who was later fired (or quit) details the whole bloody mess.(2) Hollywood Hall of Shame by Harry and Michael Medved. The HG chapter in this book is fast, funny and unfortunately very accurate (although they reserve their biggest massacre for ""Inchon."")Anyway, the movie wasn't awful, but it did take quite a long time to tell a rather simple story. The performances were fine...but no one actor really delivers the knock-out character an audience needs to care about."
2,Quantitative Evaluation,Audio Merits:8/10; Video Merits:7/10;Scenario Merits:4/10; Cinematographic Merits:4/10;Overall Artistic Performance:3/10;DVD Extras:5/10; Recording Total Quality:5/10. Professor's Comment:Its unique interesting speciality is its 219 minutes run time.
2,Too Confusing,"I must give 'Heaven's Gate' credit for being one of, if not the most, beautifully shot films I've ever seen. Michael Cimino is/was a very talented director, but the compliments will stop there. Its almost impossible to describe the plot because it is an absolute mess. And that's an understatement. The movie give no time for us to understand anything that is going on, and it is 3 hours and 40 minutes long!!Apparently it is trying to tell the story of the Johnson County wars. How many people know what the heck that is? I know I don't know, and neither does the majority of the American public. I don't recall me learning it in history and the same can be said about most people. With that said, 'Heaven's Gate' should have told us something about the war before the movie began, but it doesn't.It goes from one scene to the next without any coherancy. After watching it, I got the feeling I'd just watched a blank screen for over three hours. See it only for curiosity."
4,Heaven's Gate,"Slow and plodding, but beautifully shot and well worth watching. Although I prefer more action in a western, I also realize that in reality, the ""old west"" consisted of a slow, plodding existence. (The so-called ""REALITY"" shows on TV need to take note - There is very little, if any, reality invovlved in those shows)."
3,A movie too far.......,"The movie takes it's time to tell the story and develop the characters. Hopefully with time, the movie will redeem itself. If you did not know that the movie was such a failure at the box office, you would appreciate it more. Overall I would recommend the movie for all fans for westerns. Just be patient through some of the longer scenes. Take in the great western landscape."
2,Cimino went ker-plunk,"Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"" were both very great films, both succeeded in getting their point across. Unforunatelly, ""Heaven's Gate"" had no point to get across in the first place! The scenery? Beautiful! The cinematography? Beautiful! The characters? Hollow! The Plot? What plot? Cimino fell off the bandwagon. The ending was terrible too, that is for anyone who knew anything about the actual incident. In history: around two people were killed. In hollywood: It was a hell of a lot more than 2 people. The Deer Hunter is one of my favorite films, Cimino had talent when it came to that, but I don't know what he was thinking when he did this. I just have to speak for any Cimino fans that think this film will be a great, step back and keep that great appreciation you have for Cimino because this could destroy it! (I myself had to go back and watch ""The Deer Hunter"" quite a few times to get the appreciation back)"
3,"Better than _Deer Hunter_, but not by much ...","Anyone looking for a slice of Western history should be warned that Michael Cimino's film about the Johnson County War is wildly inaccurate.That said, this three-and-a-half hour Western epic is grand and beautiful, though overlong. Cimino shows a good eye for visual composition and period detail. Too bad the story makes no sense."
2,Lives up to its infamously (BAD) reputation,"After 25 years, I finally decided to commit myself to watching the entire 4-hour epic that nearly brought United Artists down back in 1980.For those who don't know the backstory, this film from Michael Cimino, who'd already scored Oscar success with THE DEER HUNTER in 1978, not only forced UA to merge with MGM to save their assess, but it also ended the independent, creative run that many new and young directors had enjoyed for the past decade. The decade ""under the influence"" which had began with films like EASY RIDER and BONNIE AND CLYDE, officially ended with HEAVEN'S GATE.For it's few good points, the film has beautiful cinematography, good camera work and good performances from the cast. The story, however, is very weak and very, very slow (makes 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY look like an action film).Other than a minor hit with YEAR OF THE DRAGON in 1985, poor Cimino's career never recovered from this bomb, and it looks like it never will."
3,Heaven's Gate,I was really not impressed with this western. It was too long and drawn out. I thought it would never get over with. The action was too dull. I would not watch again.
5,A Cinematic Masterpiece,"The movie is gorgeous to behold and requires you to think. There's morality, action, romance, and every nuance of human behavior. Well worth watching."
4,Surf song critique,"The song by the Trade Winds,New York's a Lonely Town (When You're the Only Surfer Boy Around)is well worth the price of the CD."
4,2nd Purchase,"I left my copy of this CD at my brother's house a few weeks ago, my kids can't make through the summer without it but I don't have the heart to take it back from him. So here goes, 2nd purchase."
3,Augsburg Historical Atlas of Christianity,"The maps in this book are good, but not great. The accompanying text provides very good summaries of the eras shown on the maps. The book seems a bit thin, being only 60 pages long, but it does ultimately deliver on what it promises.Let me get back to the maps for a moment. They do have vivid colors, but they just appear as if they were done with very basic graphics. No contours or relief (other than one topographic map), nothing that really reaches the reader and grabs his/hers attention. Oftentimes, a map focuses on a particular region or area and all surrounding lands are left blank without even a national boundary or a natural feature to help illustrate the focal map.Though the text supports the maps, readers who buy an atlas for its maps will likely be disappointed in this volume."
4,The Power Punch of Tea,"By far the strongest of the Twinings Tea. And even with a name like Irish Breakfast Tea, its good any time of the day to drive off that sluggish/draining laze. If you crave that jumping coffee caffeine hit , but cant stand the life sucking crash an hour later, then you will enjoy this tastey tea."
5,Best black tea EVER!!!!,"This is the tea I give to everyone who visits and only wants ""Tetley"" or ""Lipton"". These friends are dedicated tea drinkers, like myself, who don't really enjoy spicey or fruity teas. We just want a full-bodied tea without the bitterness that comes from over-soaking a less expensive brand. Excellent - never bitter."
4,"A good, strong tea.","Tea: I like it, I drink it a lot. But, I don't know all the much about it. I'm not a tea connoisseur: I don't make test the water temperature, I don't brew for a certain number of minutes, and I tend to let the tea bags sit around in the pot. Still, I imagine most people are like me, so that's alright.As it is, this tea is great. It was recommended to me by my girlfriend, and it was definitely a good recommendation. It is by far what I have been drinking the most for the past while. Obviously, I prefer not to drink it black. Cream and sugar for sure. But, it's good, and my favourite for the moment. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good black tea. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I don't feel like I know enough about tea."
3,Commercial tasting but decent tea,"Much better tea than Tetley and Lipton, but not the best either.Flavor is inconsistent between batches-can taste a little thin.Try different teas-it's a big world out there."
5,Drink it RAW!,"I've been a strong black coffee drinker for 20 plus years, but had to quit drinking it due to problems with kidney stones. And I love my coffee! I looked for a substitute tea and couldn't find a really good one until I tried Irish Breakfast Tea by Twinings. I have to say, this is a blend with a hearty ""kick-you-in-the-teeth"" welcome that truly does live up to its namesake. Exactly what I wanted in the morning for that ""Off you go!"" attitude to start my day.My grocer quit stocking it, so I looked on-line and found it here, and for much less than what I was paying. One thing to note, if you do run low before the replacement stock arrives is to save the used tea bag and let it hang until completely dry. Amazingly it will make a second cup, naturally not as strong however, still pretty good in a pinch.Don't know about mixing stuff in it to tame the wild beast flavor. But, if you love your coffee black and thick, try this tea ""raw""...this is the ""MAD MAX"" of teas."
3,Simply Tea,"I'm forced to swim against the tide on this particular review. I found this Irish breakfast tea by Twinings to be exceptionally ordinary...nothing unique enough for me to try again. Quite frankly, you'll be doing just as well with a five cents-per-bag cup of Salada, Tetley, or Red Rose. Invest your spare bounty in some Maine [USA] wild blueberries, for that perfect plate of scones, tarts, or muffins...yum!"
2,Basic Entry - not very feature rich,"For the price I thought I'd get more than what amounts to a basic spread-sheet program that sync's with Quicken.Yes, when I'm spending cash, or using a CC at the store, it's great that I can enter it into the PPC and it will import it into my Quicken. But it's not stand-alone. It won't really track your portfolios. And it does not display any charts or graphs.For $10 it's worth it, for $30 I would have rather saved the money and just entered in my reciepts when I get home.I would suggest looking at alternatives like MS Money and SPB Finance."
5,great product,"I ordered this iteam for my Bearded dragon i got. Whenever i received the item, it was easy to set up and go in the tank. Even though it was a few inches to big, I easily cut a few inches off with a knife. Great product and plan to buy more things from this seller."
3,Kindle version needs improvements,"I'm a radiology resident and I love dahnert, but the kindle version needs some work.i'm pretty committed to using the kindle app on my ipad for my radiology texts, so seeing books like this on the kindle store is huge.however, a book like this DESPERATELY needs page numbers and a HYPERLINKED INDEX where the page numbers in the index are selectable and take you right to the topic. searching for keywords is a chore and slow with the built-in search function. The best textbook i've seen so far in the kindle store is the neuroradiology requisites which has all of the above features and is much more usable.Thank you for making ebooks a reality for textbooks, please continue to improve!"
2,Need improvement,The book is fine except for the search which is totally useless. Need improvement.The display is fine though. I am waiting for the update!
2,Digital disappoints for VHS classic,This big wave classic of the VHS era does not convert across well to the digital format. Vision was OK but the audio - on my copy anyway - was muffled to the extent that it was almost inaudible. The music track on the other hand is LOUD - which is a bonus as the pre-modern grunge is just right for the menace which is Mavericks - but is not a bonus when the music cuts in while you have the audio wound right up to catch some scrapings of the interview dialogue. Keeps you on your toes with the remote.
1,Failed,"As soon as I plugged this into my WinXP SP2 computerS I get an ""unknown device"" error message."
2,Elmer Gantry,Product incomplete. Missing about the last ten minutes of the film. The other movies in the product are OK. I dont recommend it to other people.
2,Bastardized version: Return of Chandu,"Chandu on the Magic Island is a poorly edited, bastardized 65-minute version of chapters 7-12 from Return Of Chandu serial. Some edits are atrocious and there are audio drop-outs and glitches. While this feature film version does include the serial ending, it begins without the storyline for the first six chapters.I am a Bela fan but, found this bastardized film disappointing, especially with the substandard print used for the Alpha Video release. While, the source print is better than many used for other Alpha releases, it is soft, dark in some scenes, has missing frames, and many hits and glitches. The source print was fair at best, neither bad or good.If you like Bela then I recommend the VCI Entertainment version for Return Of Chandu. This truncated version is not worth your time or money and Alpha Video is not totally responsible for the disappointment. Even a pristine source print would be less enjoyable than the original cliff-hanger serial."
3,Good job.,"Shipping and handling were outrageous. When the product came, I thought they had sent the wrong thing. It was a small necklace, in a movie box. There were no problems with the necklace so I didn't have to speak with them."
1,Yawn,"Boring, lame and just awful especially the whispering voices, they are so annoying. I did not get lost in the music or experiance any relaxation listening to a flute not level with sound and overpowering everything."
2,Not cost effective,"This ""book"" (booklet really) is way too expensive for its content and size. It is not really useful as a reference during the exam. The questions are similar to the actual exam though, but most of them you can find as sample explanations in the reference/review book ""Electrical Engineering Reference Manual, for the Electrical and Computer PE Exam"" by the same author. I would guess that this booklet is actually helpful in helping you review exercises without having to go back and forth between sections of the large reference book since all exercises are organized together. I suggest the publisher offer this at a lower price and I could almost guarantee more and better reviews."
4,Good resource,"A bit pricey and the questions are not completely representative, but I still found it to be useful in getting me back into problem-solving. I didn't use it as a time-saver, but simply as additional questions to use in my preparation."
5,This book invokes you to Take Back The Light!,"If you choose Goddesses and love the songs of the Earth, you will feel the rhythms and see the visions of the author as you celebrate the mysteries of the Spirit with her as she weaves philosophy and theology with feminism and spirituality into a feminist/pagan testimony.ContentsPart OneChapter OneFeminist VisionChapter TwoSpiritChapter ThreeReligion That ServesPart TwoChapter FourA Feminist/Pagan TestimonyWorth-shipMusings, Memories, and MessagesAppendixThe Religion of the Fathers: How and Why It Went Awr"
3,a little disappointed,"I ordered this to wear when my wedding ring is at the jeweler or when I'm on vacation and I don't want to lose my real ring. It is really lovely, but extremely huge on my petite hands (size 5), so it is very noticeable and fake looking. Also, one of the border ""diamonds"" fell out the first time I wore it. I'm not too worried about sending it back. It was inexpensive and I got it with a gift card. My daughter loves wearing it, so I'll just give it to her. Bottom line is, you get what you pay for. It really is lovely and would probably look better on someone with larger hands."
2,Not much bang for the buck,"If you want to try the three-step system, it's much cheaper to buy the package which contains this product along with the shampoo and conditioner for just over fourteen dollars here on Amazon. I bought the shampoo and conditioner at Whole Foods but they don't carry the Emulsion product. The shampoo and conditioner don't seem to add any more body than any other shampoo or conditioner on the market.The Emulsion product comes in a fairly small bottle which won't last long if you use their recommended dosage. As far as I can tell, it doesn't make my hair noticeably fuller. Hair gel would add more body for far less."
1,Poor Quality,"It kept taking on water, was unevenly floating, listed to the side and sank like the titanic. Waste of money."
1,Piece of...,"Overpriced junk. The replacement cartridges alone are 60 a pop. The whole thing costs them about 5 bucks to make.Buttons respond 75% of the time.Dim LCD screen.No clear all button so you have to go through and manually delete everything everytime to make a new label.Cartridges jam frequently (roughly every 45 min). It'd be okay if it were fixable, but it isn't. You have to throw out the cartridge and use a fresh one to make it work.Waste of money. Waste of space."
5,compassionately written!,"I bought this book with some trepidation, because Tom Dooley was a great hero of my childhood and I was geared up to feel defensive about the book's theme. But it was compassionately and non-judgementally written and I was on the whole pleasantly surprised by it! It also speaks volumes about discrimination, defamation, and inflicting shame upon good people who don't ""fit into the {percieved-by-society} norm"" where sexual orientation is concerned."
2,A great story in search of an author,"The tale of Dr. Dooley is indeed worth telling but, sadly, this book misses the boat. The author is mired in arcane (and not terribly interesting) tales of intrigue among Catholic factions and almost lost me many times. And although this book is a biography, the author seems strangely ambivalent towards the good jungle doctor. You never get close to Dooley. Few evocative anecdotes. You get no feel for Laos. Reading it is liking eating dry toast.Why does The Talented Mr. Ripley come to mind? I hope that someone will take another stab at writing about this remarkable man."
1,From Uruguay South America,"I agree 100% with Mr. Steven Epstein's review (February 7, 2000), about Dr America: The Lives of Thomas A Dooley 1927-1961 by James Fisher"
3,Great product but no savings here,"The product is just fine for me, I have used this brand for many years. However, this product continues to increase in price and I have bought it here before. Initially Dab Nutrition would send 2 boxes of this product making it a good deal even with the freight. The last time I ordered it, they only sent one box which makes it more expensive per ounce than you can buy it from Wal-mart for and then you have to add the freight on top."
1,wrong picture,"I did not order this product because this is Opti-Free Express, not Opti-Free Replenish. It has the wrong picture. I will mot order this product either."
4,When too much Buddy is not enough!,"Do you need this? If you don't have any or much Buddy Guy in your collection, yes you do! And you should get it now! This is as good an overview as you are ever going to get, from early to late, and the selections are well chosen with lots to enjoy. If you have been collecting Buddy Guy assiduously for years this may not be such a necessary purchase except for the dvd, unless you want to gather all the choice cuts into one place. I could go on and talk about the guitar playing, the style, the phrasing, the whatever but enough people have done that already. It's Buddy Guy: the still-performing and recording direct link to the Chicago blues of old and that journey is catalogued in this set and it's a wild, inventive ride. Go on it."
3,I love Buddy..,"I purchased this box set during one of Amazon's Gold Box specials. I was excited about the box set and just couldn't wait till it arrived. 2-1/2 weeks after placing the order, it arrived. I opened the package, opened the box set and could not get the CDs loose!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I broke my thumbnail, I have pressed and mashed, still the CDs will not release! The only way I see to get the CDs out without breaking the center is to destroy the packaging. Help! the packaging may keep the CDs in place during mailing, but can't there be a choice between ""Child proof"" and regular? I am so disapointed that I can't get the CDs out.Maybe this is a great set, but I can't hear it!"
4,Great Compilation,I bought this for my pops for Christmas this year. All of his cd's are always all over the place so I tought this would be a nice package for him. It contains many highlights of his his career. A must have for a Buddy Guy/Blues lover.
5,"Should be titled - ""Some of Buddy's Best""","Can this mans career be compressed down to three CDs?In my opinion no. He is one of ""THE GREATs"". But this set gives you a very good sampling of some of his best work.Every song included is good. Not a dud in the whole bunch.The extra DVD included is a big plus for all us Buddy Guy fans. And the little booklet that's stapled into the box cover has some good extra material also.All in all - a very good package that is well worth the money.I does make me want to fill out my collection and get more of his music."
4,"Great music, but surprisingly the DVD isn't DVD quality","Nice survey of Guy's career. Three CD's full of some of Guy's best. The DVD contains an extensive interview and good concert footage, but beware! The DVD is 4:3 standard definition or letterbox within 4:3 throughout. It shouldn't be a surprise that concert footage covering 30+ years would largely be standard def, but it is surprising that nothing on this DVD is formatted for widescreen."
5,Great for quick fix,"Installed quickly and easy, and looks pretty good. Saved me money and got the boat back on the water. I would recommend this product!"
5,Magical,"There are only a few movies on magic that I'd recommend to a stranger - THIS. IS. ONE. OF. THEM. BECAUSE. IT. IS. AMA. ZING. If you have even the slightest bit of interest in the world of magic, you'll love this one."
5,Heartwarming with a few laughs,"Once again J. Clay Tweel makes me cry. In a good way. As with King of Kong Fistful of Quarters, you can't help falling in love with these characters as they reach for the stars. The story flows nicely following an international bunch of teen magicians and you start to care deeply even if you're not interested in the documentary topic itself. But, it's MAGIC, so of course you're interested in the documentary topic. This is a fun movie that made me chuckle and evoked a few tears and I liked it."
5,Steve'O,"Closet Stops / Bumpers work great when porcelain knobs are installed onto closet doors. A Must Have Item, They use to be included in sliding tract hardware kits."
4,"""The Money Man's"" best from the '80's is featured here!","I've always been a fan of this cool vocalist, since I first heard ""Walk On Water"" and ""Take Me Home Tonight (Be My Baby)"", two of my favorites by him on the radio. Then came ""I Wanna Go Back"", ""Shakin'"" and ""Two Tickets To Paradise"" that I also like the sound of. ""Peace In Our Time"" from 1989 is new for this collection, and as for the other material, I haven't heard it that often quite yet, I'm still undecided on them. I just don't care for the sound of ""Baby Hold On"", however. I also seem to remember another song from either '90 or '91' from his album ""Right Here"" called ""I'll Get By"", being not as good as his rockin' '80's tunes. Hey did anyone else out there see Mr. Money on a recent episode of ""The Drew Carey Show""? Man, what a dumb plot, having him be formerly involved with and then marrying Mimi! Sheesh! So, this collection is pretty cool. I liked it, maybe you will too."
4,Great Songs In Great Order,"Although there are some filler songs on here it sold a lot of copies! This disc should have had "" Gimme Some Water "" in place of the live ""Where's The Party "" ! The thing about this disc is it also had a video that was called ""Pictures Of Money "". The video of the best of Eddie Money had many different songs than the cd release. The order of the songs were also great and you can listen to this cd without changing the order ! The new import "" You Can't Keep A Good Man Down "" is the best greatest hits released yet."
5,Great Music as Always,"He has a great voice. He is great live and on tape. He is very sexy, even though he smokes. I just saw him one June 27, 98 and I thought it was a great concert. I saw him back in '82 at Great America, and it was a great concert then too."
2,a few of the songs are better than his voice,"i like baby hold on,two tickets to paradise,and the duet with Ronnie Spector take me home tonight(be my baby) but his voice is a poor man's Steve Perry.the material is kindy catchy but nothing worth bragging about."
1,THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE!!!!,"I bought this product, and it had no description on the size and with it being a dart board I assumed that it was a normal size dart board. Paid almost the same as the dart board for my shipping charges and when I recieved this it was the size of my hand. I would never buy a thing from this company again."
1,Used,Printer cartrige arrived safely and on time but it was advertised as new and it was apparently used.The plastic tab that you normally bend back and forth until it breaks loose then you pull the tab out of side of cartrige with a long plastic sheet attached WAS NOT PRESENT.This means someone else pulled off tab and used cartrige. There is no way for us to tell how full or empty cartrige is.
3,BOOK REPORT PROJECT,"THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK, I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT MICHAEL JACKSON LATLEY, I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HIM. THIS BOOK TOLD ME A LOT OF THINGS I NEVER KNEW."
4,A pleasure to read,"It's always a pleasure to read information about Michael Jackson that hasn't been spoiled by later tabloid journalism mentality. Granted, the author gushes a bit much, and has a heavy use of exclamation points, but I can certainly put up with that considering that he had the facts and reasons for why people were interested in Michael Jackson. This was written in the mid-80's so if you're like me, someone who was too busy building a career and raising a family to know much about Michael's rise, then this book lets you escape into that world that you didn't know then. Through lots of my own research, I knew much of what is written here, but additionally the author delves into discography details. He also interviews and includes conversations with people that worked with Michael that give specifics that I'd never read before, for instance, how Michael's clothing style and use of brooches began. These sorts of details make the book a good addition to your library."
5,"Driving on it now. (well, not _now_!)","I bought both half-shafts for my '94 Escort, and had them professionally installed. The mechanic had no problems, said that they appeared to be of excellent quality, and they work fine. Smooth, quiet, and it really feels like we got back about 5-10 HP in the deal -- which is significant in a lightly powered vehicle like the Escort.The hard part was determining which part was the correct one -- the RWI site was nearly worthless in this regard, as was the listing here.BUT, I did finally make the correct determination."
5,Fairy Tales and Fantasies Nancy & Lee,Item just as I hoped and expected. Have the original album somewhere.Great service!
3,Good just means good,"Even though the rating for the item was Good, I wasn't expecting that there would be a scratch in the CD. I wish it would have indicated that. I might have gone up in price for another CD."
5,The Best,"My family has enjoyed this album for over thirty years and it is one of the best collections ever produced. We have it on a well-worn LP and were hoping to obtain this on CDs to share with family and friends, but were shocked to find it is selling for $100. C'mon..."
4,A very good best of.,"This is a good ""best of"" and contains all I need from the band, all the hits (the big ones) and more. I have to tell that there is a few songs I never heard before (fillers ?) Overall, this cd contains the essential and it is a very good album. God, that was more than twenty years ago !"
1,Ho-Hum,"Ho-Hum, more generic faceless 80's arena rock from one of that decades glut of REO JounreyStyx."
3,Good overview of one of Canada's biggest exports,"Mention the name Loverboy to anyone who grew up in the eighties, and they'll say either ""Working For The Weekend"" or ""that guy in the headband."" Loverboy was a competent power pop quintet, and that shows in this collection of their biggest hits. Yeah, ""Working For The Weekend"" is here, along with ""Turn Me Loose"", which twenty years after its release still sounds excellent. Basically, all their singles are here, with the glaring exception of ""Queen of The Broken Hearts,"" which actually was a bigger hit than many of the songs included (it can be found on the ""Keep It Up"" and ""Super Hits"" CD's) and arguably their best known video. If that had been included, my rating would be better. Still, a decent collection for the casual fan."
3,Why WROX is overrated,"I've been reading many reviews about WROX books and people make it sound like WROX is the next O'Reilly of tech books. So when I needed a MSS-QL design book I figured I'd give them a try, especially after their good reviews on this book.Leave it to say I'm very dissapointed. I own well over 100 tech books and this is by far the most wordy book I've read. This extra detail of wordiness does not offer some great insight into the subject but seems to serve as a way for the author(s) to turn what should be a 250 page book into a long and boring 600 page read.I prefer books that get ""right to the point"". Theory is good and all but not in excessiveness. What it really boils down to is time, this book doubles my pacing and doesn't offer more in the line of education. If I wanted to read something big, I'll buy 'War & Peace'.Bigger is NOT always better."
1,Not what I expected of Mikasa,"When I received these bowls, I inspected them before washing them, and found them to be uncommonly lightweight and ""cheap"" feeling. On most dinnerware pieces that are glazed and fired, there is typically an unglazed ring on the underside where the dish sits in the kiln during firing. When I ran my fingers across this ring, a powdery residue was left on my fingers, which shouldn't happen if the piece is of good quality. When they were hand-washed, the water went straight through this unglazed portion and left a ring of moisture (temporary discoloration) that was visible through the glaze on the bottom of the bowl when the bowl was turned upright. I immediately repackaged and returned them. This is quality that has no place in my kitchen. See also ""A Busy Mom""'s review. I believe this is the problem to which she referred."
1,Leftist Politics at its Lowest Ebb,"The premise that race is merely an intellectual construct created by Caucasians to support their racist agenda, is leftist politics at its lowest ebb. There is overwhelming imperial data, hard scientific research and scholarship that unambiguously demonstrates otherwise. Just Google the research if in doubt.The honest and open discourse of racial differences has long been taboo and closed to genuinely candid discussion. ""Seek the truth and the truth shall set you free""."
4,One Human Race,"Joseph Graves' The Emperor's New Clothes is a well-written exposition of the evidence for one single human race. Graves correctly points out that the human species could have developed into separate races, but that it didn't happen. This isn't a book of wishful thinking, but rather a book of hard science. If there is a political slant to the book, I didn't find it noticable. I enjoyed reading this book. A familiarity with high school-level genetics is required for a full appreciation of Graves' arguments and my 4-star rating is based on my feeling that Graves' intended this book for a wide audience, but wrote it beyond the level of many of the people it was intended for. People who are ignorant of one subject tend to be ignorant of many subjects. How many bigots actually paid attention in high school biology and remember their lessons in genetics?"
5,"Armstrong 12-973 1/2"" Drive Long Handle Teardrop Ratchet","This Armstrong 12-973 1/2"" Drive Long Handle Teardrop Ratchet is of an excellent quality design and at the same time affordable at a very reasonable price. It is of real value for repair shops, car garages, and also to hobbyists and do-it-yourself enthusiasts."
5,Jahiem,Another great classic from this crooner. He really belts out the sounds and my girlfriend really loves him. This is a ghetto classic
5,Da Bombdiggity!,"Jah Jah you are the Bombdiggity, baby! I am lookin' forward to your next CD and I know it's gonna blow up, too!"
3,Tremendous Vocal talant - yet lacking in moral standards,"I have waited with much anticipation for the release of this CD. Having recently witnessed him on a BET special I was instantly amazed at the talent he displayed. Music lately has been a lot of noise without any serious talent. Jaheim has a voice like none I have heard in quite some time - HOWEVER... I found that throughout the CD unnecessary profanity was used. I would not even be able to play this CD with my young son in the car with me. How can I teach him not to say ""certain words"" when they are used on almost each song on this project. Again I admire the talent- but such heartfelt lyrics do not need the profanity."
3,Borrows From the Familiar,"I bought this CD on the strength of a friend's recommendation and the strong reviews here, having not seen any of Jaheim's videos. Yes, the brotha has a ""strong"" voice, but....too reminiscent of Chico DeBarge's ""Long Time No See"" CD what with the just-released-from-prison intro and overall hip-hop, funk beat. He also definitely reminded me of Teddy as well as Will Downing (#19). But, too many slow songs at the end of the CD made it boring to me. I'd like to see him sing more ""raw"" songs, not so many slow ones. My favorites were #7, 12, 13 and 21. I still think it's worth buying. You will enjoy it while doing the dishes, paying bills or cleaning out the cat box."
4,Don't judge the book by its cover,"The appearance would be hip-hop, thug appeal. When he opens his voice, it takes you back to the soul and conviction of Teddy Pendergrass in the late 70's early 80's. Even Miles Jaye who had a one hit wonder, but had a wonderful voice. Congrats on Jaheim for his marketing team and a very nice debut album. Ironic that Tank's CD was released on the same day."
3,Jaheim is HOT,"This new artist is smoove. His voice is like silk. The old school, like Teddy. If you really want to hear R&B flavor. Check this CD out"
5,Jaheim's soulful voice,"When I first saw Jaheim on BET, I didn't have a clue to as what he looked liked. All I knew was that I fell in love with his voice. The Single ""Could it Be"" has a wonderful meaning and the meaning is that you shouldn't like a person just of the materalistic things they have, but for them. My other favorite song on this album is ""Ghetto Love."" I love the way Jaheim hit the high notes in that song and it has a nice slow dance beat to it. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves R&B or just wants a taste of something new."
3,Jaheim - Ghetto Love,"Obviously, this guy can sing and his voice brings me memories of Teddy Pendergrass. I would have never thought he would be singing about such juvenile material as representin', being ghetto, and dealing with no-good tricks. Some songs are deplorable like ""Little N***a Ain't Mine"" but he makes up for them with beautiful tracks like ""Anything"". Still, how believable can you be if you're an R&B artist acting hardcore? His second album is the same way. On your third one, Jaheim, use your powerful voice for good instead of evil."
5,Ghetto Love is Slammin'!!!,"This is one of the best CDs'of 2001. Jaheim sings with maturity and strength far beyond his age of 21 years. He best exemplifies his talents on smooth love ballads like ""Looking for Love,"" ""Happiness,"" and the duet with Terry Dexter ""Remarkable."" But, the entire CD is great from opening to close. I recomend it for anyone who enjoys REAL singing in the tradition of Teddy Pendergrass and Luther Vandross. I caught his show this week at Club Atlantis here in San Diego, and I can tell you that this man can definitely sing!!! His voice is incredible! He is not a studio manufactured singer, like some other so called singers I won't bother to mention. In addition to that I was lucky enough to meet him afterwards, and he is also a gentleman. True soul music lovers will enjoy this CD."
3,"Smooth, Smoky, and Solid Soul Debut...","Like many others, I pretty much ignored Jaheim because of the thug appeal. However after some coaxing from friends and some Web reseach, I picked up the CD on a whim. Boy, was I surprised! The music isn't really groundbreaking, hence the 3 stars, but what a voice! His singing will take u back to the old school. The fast tunes are adequate filler, but in the tradition of true crooners he kills the ballads('Heaven in your eyes', 'Remarkable', and 'Anything' especially). Most people say he sounds like TP and Luther(which he does at times), but my ears go back even further. Remember Otis Redding? Yeah, I said it! He could become that great. Remember, he's only in his early 20's. Give him some time, some stronger material, and watch."
5,excellent debut,"This was a great debut, much better than I expected it to be. Jah has a great voice and I'm looking forward to hearing his future projects."
3,Comfy & Cozy In Ruffles,"These panties were comfortable and they were my great little secret under my costume. I wear a size 7 and they were true to size for me.They were a little different then what I expected but they still were one of the highlights for my halloween costume in ""08""Bottom line is they are nice pair of Comfy and Cozy panties!"
2,Poor quality,"The item arrived, slightly less that what I expected but alright. Then after the first wear (try-on even!), a tear was visible in the seam. No returns on undergarments I guess, but I will NOT be wearing them in the future."
5,Great for Shounen-ai lovers!!,"I've watched this series a couple of times already, but thought to myself, why don't I just buy it? So I did and very glad I did! A simple story, but very nice and clever especially with the openings of each episode (double entendres galore)."
3,EXCELLENT SERIES DISGRACEFUL MARKETING TACTICS,"You cannot fault the series itself, I love it and am so glad to be re-visiting ""Streets"".I think I will have to reconsider buying anymore volumes due to the disgraceful tactis used by the studio to sell the dvds. I could not believe that Season TWO Volume ONE has only ELEVEN episodes. Why the volumes one and two when there are so few episodes in the season.For goodness sake increase the price by 10.00 and sell it as a complete season."
2,Wait until the whole season 2 will be released in one DVD set,They did it with season 1. First they released it in two volumes for a total of $60.00 and now they released season 1 in one dvd set for just $53.00 so wait and not buy this season 2 vol 1 until they release the whole thing unless u can't wait at all...
1,Streets of SF season 1 volume 1 DVD,"The first time I bought this from Amazon it wouldn't play. I got part of the first disk to play on I Blu-Ray player ( I have 2 Blu-Ray players and 2 DVD players, all different brands) but it wouldnt play through and I thought it may have been because the disks were all scratched. I sent it back to Amazon who were nice to exchange it for this time, an unscratched copy. However the new disks won 't play beyond showing the CBS logo because not one of the 4 disks in this volume will allow the menu to show. Very Frustrating, to say the least. Has anyone else experienced trouble with these disks? I have a DVD and Blu-Ray library of around 1500 in quantity and this is the only time I have ever experienced disks that won't even play the menu!!! And that's each of the 4 disks!"
4,Streets Of San Francisco Season2 Volume 1,Great quality of scenery and acting when you consider this is made in 1973.Michael Douglas is probably making his best acting scenes only overgone by Basic Instinct.And Karl Malden also act very well and he's conviencing as a Leutennant. You forget thatthe film crew are there. Probably the best police-series on television. Great scenery also.Retroviewer!
3,Nice gift for a Rolling Stones fan,"This is a nice gift for a Rolling Stones fan. My brother saw it on my coffee table and commented on how he liked it. I sent it to him for Xmas. Nice price, decent pictures, okay text, but a nice, reasonably priced gift book. Too bad I couldn't find it in hard cover!"
5,These are good,Anyone who shoots will enjoy these targets. They are a good size and clearly marked. We would get them again.
4,Heavy weight paper,I am looking forward to heading to the farm and laying down some rounds downrange on these targets. You can't beat the price for the quantity you get. A good buy
5,"Excellent Targets, Nice Price!","I have been looking for some Silhouette targets for a while now, but I believe that paying over $.50 per target is a bit steep. I stumbled across these and it was $20 for 50 targets, so I jumped at the offer.The targets are much larger than I believed they would be (not a bad thing at all). The paper seems (to me) quite heavy and durable.Another reviewer indicated they resembled an obese or larger man, I would agree with that. If you want to aim at a normal size man, just forget the ""D"" lines on the target :p. Also, someone had mentioned the target lines where hard to see with open sights on a rifle at longer distances (50-100 yds). I would say he is correct, but I rarely shoot that far with open sights. Its quite easy to distinguish the lines at 100yds with a scoped rifle.All in all, I think this is a great buy. After I shoot all of these I will be purchasing some more."
4,"Great for close pistol, but not for distance shooting",This target is great for use by those not new to pistol shooting. The size is a smaller profile than the black police qualifying target that is similiar in size to that of an obese man. Were I to review this just for shooting at 10 yards and under I would give it a five and should you just want targets for that then get it now! This target is a poor choice for distance shooting with iron sights. The thin black line can not be seen at farther distances. I shot this target at 100 and 200 yards and could really not tell where the center mass of the target was and just forget trying to do a head shot unless you were working with a scoped rifle.
3,What can I say they are targets??,"Uh Targets? As far as IPSC Targets o they are cheap for shipping to Alaska. Other than that they tear very easily, and they are kind of cheap."
1,Won't ship to MA,"Ordered. Won't ship to MA, ordered me a refund.Silhoutte targets are not illegal in any shape or form in MA unless purchased by some very few for-profit gun clubs."
2,Large but flimsy,"Great sized target with outlined kill zones but it's way too flimsy for dangling on a wire at a gun range.I have found that if you fold the top a few times in 1"" increments about 2-3 times you can definitely use it.Taping other smaller targets to it (like one of the 100 pack gammo's) makes them useful but I don't think I'd buy these again."
3,electrosage igia,I bough this product. I think 10 years ago and I never used finally I had this. Back pin pinch nerve and my hand was so weak! I started usin it help me to get better and the secret to stic the pads is to splash some drops of water and stic really! Good my back and arm pain is helping me and my husband had motocycle accident this help him with he pains he has metal in part of his arms shoulder and leg and this helps with the massage I like it personally
5,"Good, Solid Crime Novel","Surprising how Doolittle can take a little barren patch of geography and weave a compelling tale featuring realistic characters and an orderly plot which he reels out a little at a time. I disagree with reviewers who say the plot is dull -- it isn't -- and that the main character, Tom Coleman, is a pain in the neck. Actually, I liked the guy. As an ex-reporter, I felt his portrayal was authentic and I found him a sympathetic character, although he did drink too much. Anyhow, I thought it was a good, five-star read."
4,Love to read,"Sean Doolittle writes great books! The story line is interesting, there are many characters with interwoven stories. Sometimes I feel like I need a chart to keep up! I have read several of his books and have not been disappointed. His latest book is excellent - a page-turner down to the very end. Keep it up, Sean!"
5,Great little pair of scissors!,"I use these to carry with my crocheting, they are sharp and have a nice point. Comfortable to handle. I would purchase these again."
2,Skip it!,"I do not know what all these 5 star reviews are raving about. I didn't like this book for several reasons. They are, in no particular order: It's about too many people and not one of them gets a thorough development--it's just snipets of lots of people's lives. It's only about women--how boring! The men in the book are in the background and hardly even named. This means only mother-daughter relationships are discussed, and it makes for pretty monotonous fare by the end of the book. Finally, the theme of rebellion against old world culture has potential, but the author gives it a very one-dimensional treatment. Simply move away from home and drink too much and you're saying something new and different about living in the American melting pot? In short, I though this book was shallow. I wouldn't have finished it if not for the book group I read it for."
4,Memories of the way we were..,"Having grown up in a Polish neighborhood on Chicago's South Side with a grandma (bushia)who emigrated from the ""old country"", this book was like a stroll down memory lane. Grandma filled out stomachs with perogi, kluski, and kelbasa, our heads with captivating stories and our lives with unforgetable customs and rituals.Pears on a Willow Tree is the story of four generations of Marchewka women: (mothers and daughters)Rose, Helen, Ginger and Amy....some of them seeking to assimilate yet preserve the past and it's traditions while others fight to supress and escape from those same traditions. Ultimately all of these women are trying to find that ""impossible pear"".Believe me, you don't have to be Polish to love this book!"
5,LOVED this book! Better than therapy!,"When I was born, I was the fifth generation daughter in the US. My family emigrated from Eastern Europe around WW2 and I was the second generation born here. I could not believe how much this story moved me. I know these women - I am these women. We read this for my book club and I purchased the books from my other club members to send to my mother, aunt, and two cousins. I hope they see what I saw! If you wonder where you came from, where you are going and why you are/aren't like your mom, grandmother, great grandmother... this book may move you also. I would give it ten stars if I could.Thank you - Leslie!"
4,Overall a pretty good read.,"This reviewer enjoyed this book. I can relate to Amy quite a bit. At times I would forget who was speaking and a bit confused, but I enjoyed the way it was written. Maybe the subject hits home for too many people, or maybe alcoholism is accepted in the world today, but this book had me from the beginning.I felt the ending was a bit abrupt and wish it would have ended on a different note, but I hope to get other books from this author."
5,its cute.,gave this as a funny gift to someone. he liked it. i like it too. its silly cuz bun buns are not evil!! theyre adorable! lol
3,For adults,"My husband and I are of the Monty Python generation, so when he opened this gift bag with the DVD, the knight and the killer rabbit, he thought it was very funny. Our kids (in their early twenties) asked what this was and said they didn't ""Get it"". After they watch the movie it will make more sense I'm sure. As a prop - the killer rabbit is funny. We were never able to get his mouth to stay open, otherwise, it looked just like it did in the picture."
3,It's cute but...,"Though I know Monty Python, I got this for another reason that has to do with a running joke between other writers and I. I will second that, if you have the money, get the bigger one. It's cute but the picture they show looks far better than the toy itself and, despite what the picture shows, there is no way to keep the mouth open without applying direct pressure to it, something that was a big disappointment to me. But, for what it is, it's cute and good for a couple chuckles for those of us that are fans."
3,I'm not terribly impressed.,"To be honest, I'm not sure I would immediately ""get"" that this is suppossed to be the legendary killer rabbit if I didn't know what it was meant to represent. Not really all that cute or scary or clever. Not terrible, but then not great, nor essential."
1,Poor Quality &Very Small,"I purchased as a gift & returned it. It was too small and was of pretty poor quality. It has a clip inside to open/close the mouth & it was barely working. I ended up buying the slippers, which are fun (for Monty Python fans) but one of the seams popped on the second day they were worn."
3,Like findin a needle in a haystack,"The book is the haystack and the useful content is the needle.Maybe a little harsh but this book was way too wordy and ""scientific"" for my taste. when it came down too it however it had very useful and uplifting words, just not enough for me. The author should have supplied a useful content color decoder or something to cut down all the wasted time looking for the needle. Sorry Mr. Johnson-Hill, no intended disrespect. Jah guide jah provide."
1,misleading picture,i thought this was an internal modem as the image shows. apparently not. please be careful before ordering.
5,Wireless LANs,"This book is a virtual requirement for anyone attempting to take the Certified Wireless Network Professional exams. I was able to pass the Certified Wireless Network Administrator exam (cwne.com) with the information presented in the book. It covers IEEE 802.11 wireless network physical and data link layers in extensive detail. The text is written in an easy to follow format, without omitting the important technical issues. The author effectively uses real world examples, and step by step wireless LAN implementation guides. Included in this version of the book is expanded coverage of the new 802.11a standard and the OFDM physical layer. Bluetooth and 802.11b interference is also covered to some degree."
3,good theory,very theoretical. don't expect practical considerations. but very thorough in its description. good compliment if you already have a good wireless understanding.
2,"Not bad, but...","A good book for all who want to know more about the 802.11 standard: Almost all protocol details are clearly explained and even deployment issues are covered in the project section. But I'd expected some information about the (currently) most important WLAN problems: interference with other ISM technologies (e.g. Bluetooth) and security (TGi, 802.1x, Radius, Kerberos..). Overall I found the book disappointing: If you own the first edition of Geier's book, don't buy the second. And: If you have either of the books, go through the Usenet discussions and read the studies about 802.11 security (Borisov, Fluhrer, Stubblefield) to get a complete view."
4,Good book for its purpose,"While this book is focused more on administrative deployment and less on the actual functionality of 802.11, the reality is that this allows it to continue being valuable even though 802.11 networks have changed dramatically over the years.If you want to understand 802.11 networks at a moderate level - technically - I would acquire the Wireless# official study guide when it becomes available from McGraw-Hill. If you want to understand 802.11 networks at an in-depth level, I would get the official CWNA study guide from McGraw-Hill and Matthew Gast's 802.11 Wireless Networks, 2nd Edition. When you want to master 802.11 security, go with the CWSP official study guide and the Cisco Wireless LAN Security book (not just for Cisco - believe me). From a management perspective, this book still has some value, however, Matthew Gast's book has an excellent chapter on this as well."
4,If the Cocteau Twins jammed with Suzanne Vega...,"I found this album in a thrift store. Very impressed with 'Satellite', could've been a hit. 'Lullaby' is also very good. Not sure what this band is up to now, but this album's from 1997, has the spacey sound of cocteau twins with suzanne vega-ish lead vocals."
1,Oo-long or Oo-short,"I usually do not bother to write any reviews as I think there are enough reviews already that one more makes little difference. Not in this case. I do not know what the people who wrote about this tea before me drunk or smoked (e.g. Kasia S., et al). I wasted hard earned $16 on something that even does not taste like a regular cheap washed out tea bags one can buy at any no-frills grocery store. If you never had a real Oolong Tea (like Pete's Phoenix Mountain Oolong) you may be fooled into believing that Oolong Tea tastes like this product. I think it sucks big time and I think potential victims should know the truth about it. This is how I use reviews for other products on Amazon to get an honest assessment of something I am thinking of buying. I am giving away all 5 boxes of this tea to people I do not know as shipping it back would waste additional time I do not want to donate."
1,What happened?,This was my go-to Oolong tea for years (thanks Subscribe and Save!). But something has happened in the past few batches. It's literally tasteless now - I've had white tea with more flavor. I just tried the Yamamotoyama brand (available from Amazon) and it's a much better alternative - smooth and toasty.
2,Twinngs China Oolong Tea,I was dissapointed in the tea. I have tried many Twinning Teas and other Oolong Teas and this just did not come close to another brand that was not available through Amazon.
5,LOVE this tea,I had been looking for quite some time for the tea that I had in a Chinese restaurant some years ago. I finally realized that the type of tea that was served there was Oolong. I tried several other brands of Oolong tea before I tried Twinings. I absolutely love their tea and would never go back to any other variety. I would describe the tea as medium/light in strength. This is the only tea that I drink. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a warm soothing cup of tea...
3,Nazz III With A Twist,"I pretty much agree with Bob Rixon on his recommendations and I would like to throw in Carson's ""Christopher Colombus"" and Todd's ""Magic Me"" into the mix. But this album relies too much on softer material (perhaps because the best bunch of the songs went to Nazz Nazz). However, there are differences between the vinyl version of Nazz III and this CD. On ""Only One Winner"" this CD has Todd & Stewkey sharing lead vocals where the vinyl has only Stewkey's lead vocals. ""Magic Me"" is remixed and sounds fuller than the vinyl version with the drums dominating the right and center channel. Finally, ""Christopher Colombus"" is also remixed where Thom Mooney's drums dominate the right and center channel with the band virtually being drowned out by the drums. Nevertheless, this is still a worthy CD to have."
4,Tasty but not Lactose Free,"I purchased this product for its consistency in good flavor, for a protein substitute that was dairy and soy free, and for the spirulina benefits. All was fine until I discovered that the whey used in it still had enough lactose to be bothersome for me."
3,It has problems in scanning slides,"If you intend to use the scanner for digitizing 35mm slides, be aware that this scanner has some problems. If you load the slide holder with 16 slides, the preview scan may only recognize 8 or 10 of these, and you have to try to manually recover the others. This may or may not be successful. This is especially a problem with slides that are relatively dark, but the same slides were scanned without difficulty by my old Epson scanner.A second major problem is that the preview scans present as tiny thumbnail images which are too small to properly evaluate or modify using image editing software. I could find no way of enlarging the thumbnails, and the online HP technician confirms that there is no way to enlarge them. I regard this as a serious problem. At least for me the scanner does not function satisfactorily as a slide scanner, (the principle reason for which I bought it), and I have returned the unit."
2,Not a true 4800 dpi scanner,"Don't by this scanner if you expect anything close to 4800 dpi.I bought this scanner with the intention to scan my slides.I was not able to get the resolution I expected from a 4800 dpi scanners.The result was only marginally better than the result I gotby projecting the slides and taking images using my 3 MPix digicam.By using the ""slanted edge"" method I measured a resolutionthat rather looked like a 1200 dpi scanner.Also when using the slide adapter the result become evenworse since the slides become more out of focus.Got no help from HP support. The reaction to my measurementswas basically ""that's the way it is""Also: The software user interface is kludgy and hard to work with.This is not what I expected from HP, my previous experience ofHP-products is quite good."
2,HP Scanner,"This scanner is a major disappointment. Scanned color slides are out of focus and too soft to enlarge beyond 4X6 prints. 35mm and 2.25X2.25 Scanned negatives contain distracting/ugly halos around the edges of ALL highlights that turn enlargements into waste paper. Only 4X5 negatives seem to live up to this scanner's reputation. Smaller B&W; negatives invariable show what looks like disturbing pre-exposure in the shadows. This turns prints into more waste paper.I have an extensive collection of 1970s professional sports negatives I planned to scan and print. Thus far, I've succeeded in getting nothing near the quality of straight prints from the orginal negatives. I permanently dismantled my darkroom some years ago and switched entirely to digital. My scans are so inferior I'll need to turn over any negatives I finally decide to enlarge to a professional lab."
1,Slides and HP Scanjet 4890,"This scanner is a disappointment. Scanned color slides (mostly fuji sensia 100) are out of focus, too soft and far too blue. It certainly doesn't live up to my expectations. Scanned documents and pictures are of a better quality."
1,Giving up on the 4890,"When the 4890 actually scans it does OK. The software is easy to use and has some useful photo editing features. (My skills are limited to home use.) Unfortunately, the 4890 has documented problems running with the Dell Dimension PC's (which I run) and what it takes to scan two photos in a row is not worth the re-booting. I've given up. Already ordered a Canon. The 4890 is for sale ""as is."""
4,Customer review,An amazing and little-told story about air power in WW2. Fit nicely with a number of other books I just recently read.
3,A mixture of aspect ratios,"A word of warning for future purchases - I purchased this today and despite the cover saying that the set contains two DVDs with a movie on each side, there are in fact four stacked DVDs on one spindle. Furthermore, despite the cover (and indeed each disc) stating that each of the four films are 16x9 transfers, they are in fact a mixture of 16x9 and 4:3 (pan and scan transfers)! In my set, On Deadly Ground was 4:3, whilst the rest were the proper widescreen versions.I may just have had a faulty batch, but be warned.As for the movies, they range from the classics of Hard to Kill and Out for Justice, to the unusual but hellishly brutal On Deadly Ground to the so-so Exit Wounds. Normally this set would have had a 4 star rating overall, but the terrible pan and scan disc makes it lose a star."
5,"Loved the movies, been a Seagal fan for years.",Seen these movies several times just wanted to ad them to my collection. These movies are the type to enjoy over and over.
1,heat pack review,"Much too light weight & does not transfer heat effectively to the body, especially when placed over back/neck while lying face down."
3,Heating Pad,This is a flimsy heating pad and not very big. I think of king size to be a lot bigger and I am not a large person. It is not that soft and not very flexible. I am returning it.
5,Worth it,This heating pad is a little more expensive than the others. But it is worth it. We already have one and one night my husband and I both needed it. So I went on amazon and ordered second one just like we already have.
1,DO NOT WASTE THE MONEY,"On the second time of using this heating pad, the connection inside the pad itself shorted out burning a hole in the pad and leaving a burn mark on my face. Thankfully the burn mark left on my face was small but it could have worse. The quality of this product, in my opinion, is poor, extremely poor. I gave this product a star only because I had to give it something in order to write this warning."
5,Excellent,Excellent heating pad. Doesn't scrunch up like others do and the thermostat actually works like it should. Recommended
5,It's a good purchase.,This heating pad is nice. It's a good size and has been designed so that the cover does not slide off. That is a huge plus in my book.
4,Sunbeam health home king size heating pad,Heating pad heats very nicely but what I wish I knew was how short in length it is considering it says it is a king size. Actually looks more like a regular.
2,works well...but only for a while,"I also enjoyed using this heating pad for about 6 months. It wasn't fancy, but just what I needed. About 6 months later, it just stopped working. I'm shopping for another one and I'm seeing that this problem was not just a fluke because many others are writing the same complaint. Too bad, but I won't be spending money on this brand again. Hope this is helpful to everyone looking!"
1,Not hot,This heating pad really doesn't get all that hot to get deep into the muscle like it should. I bought a much cheaper one at Wal-**** that gets nice and hot for thoes deep down muscle aches.
2,mediocre,"After purchasing a large Thermophore Moist Heating Pad (14 x 27), and appreciating the good results, I decided to get a small one, too. Thermophore's price on the small one was higher, so I went for the Sunbeam. There is no reasonable comparison. The Sunbeam is mediocre. It was returned, and I purchased a Thermophore 14"" 14"". It is excellent."
2,?????????King Size??????????,"A friend of mine has the blue pad that you can strap to you, and it's a good product, so I decided to get one.... but I saw a King size, and I thought this was even better.Wrong!This King size is little larger than the blue strap model, and doesn't seem to produce as much heat either."
4,Very comfy,"This heating pad is very comfy because it's so soft and pliable. That's the good news. The downside is that I have had to replace this heating pad every two years since it came out. It seems to die after a couple of years. Even so, I always buy it again because it is so soft and comfy. I use my heating pad everyday because of arthritis and fibromyalgia. I will continue to buy this heating pad as long as it is offered. It doesn't get very hot, more like, just right."
3,"Does what it needs to, but is a bit small to be called ""king size""","Advantages:- Reliable, two-hour, auto-off function- Price point: definitely cheaper than a pet heating pad, if you're planning to use it for small pets- Heat output: three levels of heat provide enough, if not too much heat- Size: easy to move around and not bulky (17"" x 14"") with decent cord length (~90"")- Washable: machine washable or hand washable, although I wouldn't try it in the machineDisadvantages:- Size: would be too small for some individuals or med-/large-size petsOverall, I give this three stars. It's not a stupendous, mind-blowing heating pad. But, it's average and does what it needs to. It'd be great to have a timer to turn it back on, but then you'd pay more."
1,Didn't Last Long,I purchased this product on 02/01/09 & it has already quit working on 04/19/09. Of course the date has passed to return it. It was working well & then just quit.All it does now is the light blinks & won't heat up at all. It's also much too small to be called a king size heating pad. Much smaller than my last one.
1,Horrible! I've had the original and the replacement break on me.,"Looked up this item online, and many others have had the same problem. The thing works for a while and then the red light will start blinking for no reason and that's the end of the heating pad. Avoid this like the plague! I'm now looking for a non-Sunbeam replacement."
1,Temperature varies and item is quite small,"Despite the name, this heating pad is quite small. The biggest problem with it, however, is that it fails to maintain an even temperature. There are times when the first setting is barely warm, and other times when it is unbearably hot. I have used other Sunbeam pads that have been very good, but I would not recommend anyone buy this particular pad."
1,DANGER!,"I threw this heating pad out recently due to a ""burning"" odor. Before that occurred, the light would blink and the heating pad would turn itself off soon after being turned on. Once off, the cord remained warm to the touch. I always took proper care of it, hoping it would last for many years.I had it for 2 years, but it was always unreliable and frustrating to try to use. It either would stay on well beyond 2 hrs or turn off within a few minutes."
3,OK so far,I'm not so sure about this heating pad. It has four levels of heat but to me it seems as if the last three are about the same. I wish it got warmer than it does. The way the cover is sewn on should make it keep its shape longer. I also noticed that the control for the heat levels gets warm as long as it's plugged in and it doesn't matter if the pad is turned on or not. That doesn't seem right.
2,good while it lasts,I bought this for my mom. She loved it and used it during the winter months. Within one year it died--blinking light and no heat. The replacement lasted about 18 months and died the same exact way. Product has been very unreliable for us.
2,Not reliable,"Be forewarned. Today I purchased from Amazon a different heating pad to replace this one, which had been a gift. The controller on my gift stopped working, the same problem that others have reported here for this make/model. I conclude it's unreliable. For good measure, I'll mention a couple of other things. Although I used it on and off - for sore muscles - for several years, I found it quite small. Also, the stiff wiring inside made it a challenge to wrap it around a limb. It did have comfortable heat levels, and I also highly recommend an auto shut-off like this one. I burned myself falling asleep on a heating pad some years back!"
3,Does what it should do,"Ordered this for my mom and she didn't receive all of the parts the first time around. She called the 800 # and the person on the other line was very apologetic and sent her a new one the next day with everything in tact. Be careful when you purchase these items because you need to check to make sure it isn't false advertisement or if there are extra parts needed for these heating pads.All in all, a good experience, my mom is happy and the company gave me 20% for the hassle. Everything worked out in less than 2 days."
2,The worst of Lewis,"After reading, and thoroughly enjoying, Mr. Lewis' other books, I decided to complete my collection with Pacific Rift.Big mistake. This slim (just over 100 pages) book on early 90s-era U.S.-Asian relations is both dated and poorly conceived. I lost much interest before the 50 page mark.Pick it up only if you are a Lewis completist. Otherwise, stick to his much better writings like ""Moneyball"" and ""Liar's Poker."""
5,Reviewing some of the films I like,"Each of the four films here are ones that Charlton Heston made early in his career. His acting in each are unique to the story line of the picture. Of the four I like the best one entitled Skyjacked. I just like airplane movies I guess. If you like intrigue at every turn, then you will enjoy this one. The other three films deal with science fiction and the future of mankind. I think any one will find something they admire in all the films. It's a good one to own and the cost is just right. Enjoy!!!!"
3,Crossing over,"Though the arrangements can border on schmaltzy often, Charles's crystalline charisma as musical translator shines through. Good-hearted old soul music for sure, but one that is more preserved than personal."
5,A Classic,No Matter what Category you put Ray Charles in he always comes thru.this disc shows his Country side and he is a Natural.Bye Bye Love is Great.as is You are my sunshine.he is a Genius in any style.
3,A Good Read,A sensual story of friendship. Debrena Allen is a dancer determined to make it to the top. As Debrena enters a relationship with a woman she struggles with issues of identity and sexuality. Because Debrena likes men she doesn't consider herself gay or bisexual. I could feel Debrena's feelings and her confusion. Read with an open mind. You don't have to be gay or bisexual to get this story. I found it to be a good read. Full of human emotions.Dawn
2,A timewaster,"Don't be tempted by the low price or influenced by the fame of the author. Quite honestly, it did not take long to notice that the puzzles were worthless for serious project managers. But I kept going to be proven wrong. Regretably, I should have invested my scarse time elewhere. I teach in graduate school and can attest to the fact that you won't learn much about project management."
2,Poor nonstick coating,"We received several pieces of Professional Nonstick II cookware for our wedding and the nonstick coating is horrible. After just a few months the surface became pitted and food sticks very strongly. Furthermore, the rivets that hold the handle in place are exposed metal and food sticks there every time (and quite vigorously). Since you cannot scrub the nonstick surface, you are left to either watch as more and more food sticks to the pan or just throw the pan away after only a few months of use."
2,Nonstick=More Work,"Calphalon makes the best hard anodized pans. Buying one that is coated with Nonstick material (even Non-Stick II) is not only a waste of the hard anodized material, but is asking for trouble. I have a set of Nonsticks that now stick much more than the regular ones without Nonstick material -- and you can't scrub them. I will only buy the originals from now on -- at least you can scrub them clean."
4,Good quality,Great non stick surface. The quality is amazing. However like with any non stick surface it will lose its non stick over time. The calphalon pan is built to last but four stars due to its wear over time. Without the non stick surface the pan becomes useless. Overall still satisfied with the time lasted vs. amount of use.
5,no warranty?,"I'm not sure if this pan has a warranty - the Calphalon website's ""Warranty Information"" does not list the ""Professional"" line. btw, this pan comes in a plain brown box (no Calphalon name on it) and is made is China (not Toledo). It works beautifully, however - great heat distribution, easy to handle, trivial cleanup."
2,Not what I expected from Calphalon,"I've gotten fabulous bargains on Calphalon at Amazon before - top quality stuff at great prices. So I thought I was getting the same with this pan. Not so. The non-stick coating is fine, but the pan seems cheaply made because of the handle. It's not a nice, heavy, cast handle like I usually get, but made of some sort of lightweight metal that I'd expect to find on a cheap grocery-store pan. The edges on the handle aren't even smooth."
5,Fantastic handy pan,"I purchased this pan after doing a lot of research and I love it. I have a professional gas range and most pans leave an unevenly browned bottom with a normally charred gas ring imprint. This pan does not. It is amazing. The pan heats slowly and evenly. Heat is retained well and the bottom is evenly browned. It is perfect for a 3-6 egg omelette and can be finished under the broiler if so desired. I noticed in my research that a purported disadvantage to the non-stick surface is that sauces do not brown, that is not the case in my hands. I have made sauces of all kinds and have been very satisfied with the results. Caramelized onions and garlic are as lovely in this Calphalon non-stick pan as they are in my stainless steel All-Clad pans."
1,Returned twice (non-stick surface wore out),"We had this frying pan and the bigger one and had to return both because the surface ceased to be non-stick after a few months of use. Given everyone else's stellar ratings, there is a possibility that this was our fault, but we have the pots also and they are great.After four frying pans that were unsatisfactory we returned them and did not purchase a third set. We replaced them with Tramontina Commercial Grade (thirty dollars for three at Sam's Club) and the difference is absolutely unbelievable.I would highly recommend the Calphalon pots, but cannot recommend the frying pans."
3,I really love this pan BUT,The nonstick coating is gone. Just gone. I bought this pan in Sept of 03 and the nonstick coating is gone.
3,cool novels...,"The story is cool,and we dont have this damn clan. I really like the story and William Keith jr describe very well. You can feel the atmosphere of battletech in this book"
1,"If you're not creative at all, buy this book.","Honestly, this book is not for anyone who's cooked before. If you have common sense you don't need this. Unless you don't know how to prepare oatmeal or put spinach in a bowl, you really should save your money and buy something else."
4,"An excellent vegan reference, if a bit spartan","I love the idea of a vegan lifestyle. I followed McDougall's plan for almost a year. If it had been just me, I would have found it much easier to do. But as a busy mom with a dedicated carnivore for a husband, it became too hard to keep up with. I also question the concept of keeping one's fat intake to 10 grams a day or less. I found my body needed more to keep my hair and skin healthy. As well, my system needs the amino acids found in animal proteins to keep functioning properly. But all in all, for what it is, this book (and plan) is the gold standard, and can be of real benefit to many people. The recipies are easy and delicious, and easy to follow. I still use some of them to this day."
2,...,"I bought this book because of the many positive reviews it has.However, I had no chance to try it. I have no idea if it works, because the majority of sample foods he uses are hard to find outside the US.The recipes are supposed to take 15 minutes to prepare... added the day you spend looking for the ingredients... For me it was a copmplete waste of time and money. I only wish I had known this before buying it."
3,Too Simple,"This recipe book is great for the busy person who has no time to cook and limited cooking skills. THe recipe are fast, simple, filling and nutritious. The problem I have with the book is I love to cook and I like a lot of complex flavors and textures in my meals. I had to really search to find meals to suit my plallet. I love to entertain and there were very few dishes that I would be able to impress my non-vegan family and friends with. My last conplaint about the book is there is no pictures. A picture is worth a thousand words. The best part about the book is the information littered throughout that keeps you motiviated to eat animal free. There was a lots of new information, graphs, charts and satistics that I found encouraging. Perhaps this book is best suited for people who do not like to spend a lot of time in the kitchen or those who are new to a plant based diet."
4,McDougall's best,"I own several McDougall cookbooks and this may be the best one yet because the recipes are not only healthy -- that's a given with McDougall -- but also quick and easy to fix. Oh, yes -- and tasty too."
5,Practical & Delicious,"I enjoy trying Mrs. McDougall's recipes. I love trying out new plant-based recipes. They come out delicious, nutritious, no-fat and quick to make. It is everything that I want from a recipe book, other than the recipe making it itself-:)"
3,Mediocre but Informative,"Some of the recipes are just boring, some are bland, BUT, the book is very informative with lots of information regarding nutrition and health. There is a number of recipes that I have used, but a lot just don't sound appealing. Read reviews of his other books, one sighting that this book is lacking great recipes because of the whole ""quick and easy"" concept. Absolutely going to try one of McDougall's other cook books in hopes of a better outcome."
4,Good Source for Plant based low fat Cooking Ideas,"This book intersperses short health essays with time saving recipes and short health, shopping, and recipe tips. The table of contents lists the following chapters: Breakfast, Salads and Dressings, Soups and Stews, Main dishes: Grains, Main dishes: Beans, Main dishes: Pasta, Main dishes: General, Sauces, Dips and Spreads, Desserts, Canned and Packaged Products. The Canned and Packaged Products chapter is more than twenty pages and lists specific brand-name products. I found this very helpful in stocking my panty with products which have no added oils.Each recipe includes preparation time and cooking time. The recipes are quick and easy, and the ingredients are generally easy to find. Recipes do not contain specific nutritional information such as calories.There are no photos in this book. The book has basic matte paper and simple drawings."
5,Quick and vegan correct,The McDougalls have compiled 300 delightful low-fat/vegan recipes that can be prepared quickly with most ingredients one has on hand! Healthy and delicious!
2,McDougall's Book a Disappointment,"The McDougal Quick & Easy Cookbook is a disappointment. Why? Beans, beans,beans and more beans. How many bean recipes - that aren't that creative or different - can one eat? I am hoping that the new McDougal book will contain more creative recipes with a greater variety of ingredients. We'll see.Adrian"
2,"Quick, yes. Good, no.","I was not very impressed with this book. There are plenty of quick and easy recipes, that's true. However, I would rather spend a couple more minutes to eat something that also tastes good. I found the recipes to be very basic and just not very inspiring.Also, I wasn't impressed by the fact that many recipes call for canned foods. If you are trying to be healthy, eating canned foods (and thus, BPA), is not the best practice. Once you take into account soaking beans, many of the recipes are not even quick. There are better books out there."
4,McDougal cookbook,This is a wellmade well researched vegan cookbook. I found out at this time I am unable to follow it.
5,McDougall cookbook,"Contains a lot of yummy sounding, healthy recipes. This will definitely help my family's health. Everyone should check this out."
3,Food quickly becomes boring,"The diet works - I quickly lost 30 pounds and kept with it for about a year. Unfortunately, I found the recipes very boring and not particularly good. I hate to cook, so the title of the book was appealing. But I have to say, there are only so many ways you can put beans, corn, and tomatoes together. Ultimately I quit the diet, gained back all the weight and then some. I got to the point where I could not stand the thought of stomaching one more of these recipes. I have been a vegan for several years - and so I was already accustomed to eating a plant based diet. Quick and easy - yes, but I would argue the delicious."
4,Technically NOT completely vegan,"My doctor recently recommended that I adopt a vegan diet. I have enjoyed the recipes in this book and am learning a lot. However, this book is technically NOT completely vegan as stated in many reviews, including the review from Booklist. What causes this technicality is their use of Worchestershire sauce in many of their recipes. Worchestershire sauce contains anchovies. I have no problem with this as I can always choose to not prepare those particular recipes or can leave the Worchestershire sauce out. I am making the comment simply to try to forwarn people of this technicality. I'm glad I bought the book. I just don't want anyone to feel they've been misled."
5,Racing Tactics,This is the best of the Dr. Walker books. It's a concise treatice on all the tactical elements needed for around the buoys racing.
4,Must-have for your racing library,"If you've been bittin by the racing bug and are looking to advance your skills, this book is a must-have for your library."
5,A Classic,"A must read from a real survivor. Facts, facts and more facts about a barbaric procedure compiled by a brave soul who got severely punished by this so-called ""treatment"" because he decided to become a vegetarian and a reader of good books as a young man. His parents were horrified and managed to get him committed to an institution."
3,"""Not too BAD""","I thought this movie was some what realistic and seeing how the directo said he had certain zombies run and others kind of slack behind based on the time of death, so that was a plus, and Tom Savini was in the extras along with ROMERO! The best part in this movie was not in the movie itself but in the extras where George was talking about his new movie he's trying to make to follow up Day of the dead. But the gore was mainly in the zombies, you get to see there heads blow up and and blown away, but there were some cheesy ""matrix"" scenes that didnt quite fit. Lastly, YOU DIDNT SEE ANYONE GET KILLED (any humans that is), they always cut away and on to another scene. Its worth renting."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Is this supposed to be horror movie? It seems more like a comedy, and a bad one at that, too. I blame myself for falling for the hype!"
1,I can't believe there are people who actually LIKE this movie...,"If you like this movie, then you, my misguided friend, have a serious mental disorder.Uwe Boll is a disgusting human being who has totally raped innocent video games. I have seen B movies... and this is not even a B movie. This isn't even a C or a D movie. This is a total failure. Uwe Boll himself is a total failure and so are his supporters. People need to stop seeing his movies, and everyone should sign the ""stop dr. boll"" petition. Search for it on google ""stop uwe boll.""This is absolutely ridiculous and shame on the video game makers for selling the rights to this euro trash."
1,Worst horror movie since Jason X...,"So this year has been a very good year for horror movies with 28 Days Later, House of 1000 Corpses, Freddy vs. Jason, Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a couple others. Compared to the last couple of years horror movies have been shunned because of movies like House of the Dead that give horror movies a bad name. It looked good but trust me this is an awful movie. This movie is so bad is should not have even been in theaters. Their is NOTHING good about this movie, all the elements that make a good horror movie are there with the skinny dipping girl, the creepy setup, lots of guns but once they play out you feel unsatisfyied. Even the big action scene which is a good 15 minutes long isn't worth watching this movie for. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE, YOU WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOURSELF."
2,Not as Bad as Street Fighter...Is that a good thing?,"Wow, the director really did a hack job on this one. The story was simple enough, but it was packed with cliches. Action scenes are interrupted by clips from the video game so many times that I was screaming ""OK, I GET IT, THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON THE GAME! NOW STOP!""Every opportunity to mess up a scene was taken by the director and its not gory enough to be decent zombie film. If you like zombie films, skip this one."
1,Lamest Movie Ever,"If you want to see lame acting, pointless nudity, poorly done action scenes, and horrible direction, this is the movie for you. These kinds of movies give ""Video Game to Movie"" movies a bad name. What was the point of flashing footage from the game in the movie?? The opening credits where kinda cool but it should have stopped there. The soundtrack is good...but it is the only good thing about this movie. If you want a good zombie horror flick check out Resident Evil and 28 Days Laters (not really zombie but close enough). This movie was so bad I didn't even finish watching it. Just say no to ""House of the Dead""."
1,one star is being generous,"This movie is total trash. Some kids are so desperate to get to a party that they shell out 1,000 dollars to some stranger to take them to the island. A Cost Guard boat is trying to stop the stranger from leaving dock but the kids are still more than willing to let him take them to an island just to go to a rave. This is only the beginning of the stupidity. They get to the island and find out that all the kids have either been killed or turned to zombies. Without spoiling the rest they get a lot of firearms and become martial arts experts in a matter of seconds and the fight with the zombies ensues. The cuts to the video game scenes through out the movie was both stupid and annoying. While they were fighting the zombies I wasn't sure if they were trying to create a zombie movie or a rip off of the matrix. Horrible acting and holes in the plot doom this movie. This is by far one of the worst movies of all time. Avoid at all cost or suffer the consequences."
2,What a waste.,"This movie should have been better considering it actually had a budget. I have literally seen dozens of zombie movies with no budget that were better than this. The most annoying aspect is the splashes of footage from the Sega game mixed into the story. The movie borrows heavily from Romero (boarded up survivors in an old house), but there is no substance. You will definitely pull for the zombies in this movie since all the humans are bad actors that deserve to be a zombie feast. I do have to give credit for a few gory zombie deaths, with one star given for gratuitous zombie head explosions and a second star given for gratuitous nudity. One last point - the techo music during the fight scenes(ala The Matrix) sounds like it was composed on a Casio keyboard. This movie is bad but not funny bad. Watch only if every other horror movie is missing from the video store."
1,please ignore this star,"calling this movie a bad movie is an insult to bad movies. i would give this movie no stars if i could. this is by far the worst movie ive ever seen. the acting was utterly disgusting and the plot is even worse. it had the corniest special effects ive ever seen and the worst techno music ive ever heard. this isnt even the kind of bad movie that you could laugh at like you see on mystery science theater 3000. there are bad movies, there are really bad movies, and then theres house of the dead."
3,People need to shut up,"I have talked with a lot of people who liked the movie, myself being one, and the most common thing is the movie sucks. But there are still a lot of people who enjoyed it, we don't think it was a GOOD movie but it is an enjoyable entry into cinematic history. IF YOU AREN'T A SNOB ABOUT IT.Rent this if it is cheap, rent it if it is free. Buy it if it is under 10 bucks."
3,A Kick Ass B- flick,"This movie was weird to me. First I fell that it went to fast and there was not enough action. I also thought some scenes were not original and cheesy, altough I did like the ending somehwhat, even though I don't understand it to well. I would not reccomend theis movie and do not want to own it. A decent rental to say the least."
2,Horrible movie but with one worth worthy expection,The movie was horrid. Downright horrid. Why this man was allowed to direct more movies is beyond me.The only worthy thing that this movie was good...Was the DVD menu. Very flashy and video game like - showing the characters and profile stuff. Thats it.
1,yeah...,"As plainly as I can put it:This is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my life. Keep in mind, I've seen Zombie 4: After Death!!!!Silly beyond belief with the lame inserts of the video game footage, the wretching acting (i wanted them all to be killed) and the stupid, crazy over the top main bad guythis movie...i cant even believe anyone paid money to have this PRODUCEDStay away, or you will smash your face into a wall in hopes that the blinding pain will force you to forget what you just watched."
1,"Be nice to your PSP, Don't Buy This!!","I love my PSP. That's why I will never buy this UMD. The acting is terrible, the plot sucks, and there is little to no reference to the game it is based on. To be fair I like looking at babes in bikinis as much as the next guy. However, where were they in the game this movie is based on. I'm not an expert on the House of the Dead game series but I have threw enough quarters at the game in the arcade to know that this movie only shares the name with it. I believe Uwe Boll looked at the box for the game and decided to come up with his own ideas after that. There are hundreds more movies out there that are not in the UMD format that I would rather have than this crap.Bottom line: Be kind to your PSP, avoid this UMD."
1,Worst Movie Of ALL Time,"You know what scare's me? It sure wasn't that poor excuse for a horror movie. But it's the fact that I wasted 1 1/2 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back. HOUSE OF THE DEAD is not only the WORSE movie of 2003...But the worse movie of ALLLLLLLLLLLLLL time. This movie is so bad it makes BOOTY CALL look like GONE WITH THE WIND. The acting, directing and script writing are seriously so bad my wife and I found ourselfs laughing out loud through-out most of the movie. How this movie ever made it to theaters is beyond me."
1,Where is a zero star rating when you need one.,"I have seen tens of thousands of movies in my lifetime. I am amazed and very happy to tell you this is by far the worst ever made. I watch it several times a year in complete awe that someone actually wrote this movie and then it was filmed. I think it is worth your time watching, just don't pay money for it. Get it from the library if you can. I would like to meet someone who has purchased this movie and hug them. Really though, this film is amazing... how bad it is..."
1,It's just so BAD!,"DO NOT see HOUSE OF THE DEAD! It has cheap effects and a weak, WEAK story line. The characters SUCK and most of the zombies look like trick or treaters. Everything is so un-real and bad. Ugh! The make up is disgraceful. When I was watching this I was like ""Am i in the right theatre?""... And to make it even suckier, they are dumb enough to put clips of the video game in the movie!!!!DO NOT watch this. Watch Resident Evil. Even if you've seen it an umpjillion times. Resident Evil is worth it on a better level. Kinda."
1,THE WORST movie,"I have never in my life (as an amazon.com member) felt so prompted to write a bad review, but after seeing this movie I just felt like I had to warn others.This movie contains the weakest storyline, the dryest dialogues, and the WORST acting I have EVER seen.It isn't worth your money or even your time."
2,"Fun to watch, but nothing more...","Here is yet another example of a video-game-based film gone wrong...For some reason it is another prequel (like the RESIDENT EVIL film) where it introduces the character of Rudy Currian, the mad scientist behind the first videogame. True, the movie has some cool action and MATRIX-ish special effects, but story, acting and dialouge is garbage. However, If you are a video game fan, it might be fun to check out..."
1,What a shame!,"House of the Dead. That's what we had here when we watched this groaner. George Romero, WHERE ARE YOU?? The ""premise"" of the movie has such potential and if you watch the extras on the DVD the whole crew thought they did a phenominal job, but it didnt come through on the film. During the ""storm on the house"" scene, when they try to mimic the game by doing a 360 degree view of each character, their weapons aren't even the ones they are actually using. WHERE WAS THE CONTINUITY PERSON???? The only thing positive about the whole movie was the interviews with George Romero and Tom Savini. PLEASE GEORGE, GET THE NEXT ""DEAD"" MOVIE MADE!!! I am sorry I actually spent money on this one. Anyone wanna buy it off of me??"
1,Pass this one on by...,"Yes, it's about a video game and therefore one - I suppose - shouldn't expect too much. This ""movie"", however not too seriously it's supposed to be taken, is just plain unwatchable. I've done my civic duty in warning others, steer clear of this lame stinker, fight the temptation. The one star is for the disc case cover artwork, I suppose it's passable. Rent or buy another DVD you've already seen a hundred times, you'll be much better off."
1,Not even a good bad movie...,"To be honest there isn't much there to talk about.The characters were flat, the effects were cheese and theres even a scene where you can see the spring board that a zombie jumps off of. And did anyone see the plot? I sure didn't. Even the gore is wrong. I mean, blood isn't pink last time I checked. This movie is only worth watching if you're with a group of your friends making fun of it. DO NOT spend money on this film."
1,Uwe Boll please stop!,"Wow, i am almost at a lost for words on how putrid this movie is. Uwe Boll might just be the worst director in history. I would recommend that you never buy an Uwe Boll film. If you rent one of his movies make sure that you don't have a big meal before it because you might lose your lunch."
1,"Oh, the humanity",To say this is a terrible film does a grave disservice to terrible films the world over.
1,Absolutely Awful... I loved it!!!,"This has to be one of the worst films ever made, but I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life. From the terrible acting and dialogue, to the overtly blatant nudity. From the video game footage edited into the film, to the ridiculous over-use of the Matrix camera pan. Seriously this movie makes Anaconda look good."
1,Lame,"The previews for this movie made it look good, so I rented it. Unfortunately, it was horrible. My friends and I turned it off after only about the first thirty minutes. Everything about it was awful.The snippets that replaced the action in the movie was a lame mistake. What's the point in making a horror film if the audience doesn't even get to see the action? I thought that was what made a horror movie scary.I've seen Halloween costumes that looked far better than the costumes and makeup in this movie. The actors could not act. Besides that, there were about three scenes with topless girls just in the first 15 minutes. It was plain ridiculous.Spend your money on something better. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. If it was possible to give it 0 stars, then I would."
1,was this a zombie movie or a video game ad?,"I would have rather watched my friends play the video game than have watched this movie. Everything in this movie, I really have a hard time calling it a movie, was weak and laughable. The ONLY part of this DVD worth watching is the ""zombie combat training"" or whatever it was called, because you get to the stupid girls from the movie get shot with paintballs. This is an abomination to the zombie genre."
1,Never base a movie off a videogame again,"I can picture the directors when they finished this movie. ""Hey since this movies sucks so bad, lets just show alot of scenes with topless chicks."" The story sucked, the acting sucked, the logic of it sucked, even the nudity sucked. Basically there wasn't one good thing about this movie except to please junior high kids with the nudity. The actions scenes were fake and the zombies looked stupid. The worst part was that flashes from the game kept appearing on screen. Was this some kind of subliminal message, or were the directors stupid enough to think that we couldn't remeber what movie we were watching. Pure crap. Instead rent Cabin Fever or Wrong Turn for a good horror movie."
1,Painful,"Do not, I repeat, do NOT watch this movie. It's 2 hours of your life that you will never get back. It's unbelievably bad, and not even bad enough to be campy. Uwe Boll should be lynched for unleashing this monstrosity. It's movies like this that turn people away from the horror genre."
1,Horrible,"The only review I've ever written, I feel it is my duty to humanity to warn people away from this 'movie'. If you need inspiration to clean your bathroom and take out the trash, then go ahead and rent it, otherwise don't waste your money, your time and possibly the friendship of anyone else who is around at the time."
2,Uhhh...what?,"So bad...so bad. I checked this out recently because I love horror films, and as dumb as it sounds, I remember playing the game version of this at a local arcade and loving it. I'm pretty familiar with the awfulness of Uwe Boll's work, but this really takes the proverbial cake. I actually don't think I'm quite stupid enough to actually review this movie, but I will say that I spared it from a one-star review due to it unintentionally making me laugh."
1,"So bad that it's...well, it's just bad.","I rarely take the time to write reviews but as someone who often relies on others' reviews of horror films when deciding what to buy, I felt that it was my duty to warn fellow horror fans to stay far, far away from this film. I say this as a fan of good horror flicks as well as those that are so bad that they're good! Sometimes it's fun to watch a really low budget, bad horror movie. However, I found no redeeming quality to this movie whatsoever. I'll never get those 90 minutes back. Don't make the same mistake I did. If you want a good zombie movie, watch Zombi 2 or Dawn of the Dead again. If you want a horror movie that is so bad that it's good, watch Bad Taste or heheheh...The Dead Hate the Living. Whatever you do, don't watch House of the Dead. I bought it for about $4.00 and it was still a waste of my time and money."
2,Very Badly Executed,"This movie is based upon a successful computer game, bits of which are edified into the film at various sections to underline the point. The result is the worst editing I've seen since ""the Banana Splits"". O.K., so this type of movie must be seen as tongue-in-cheek anyway, but even when you don't take it seriously this is still all quite lame. The characters are papers thin, and the action is pretty incoherent. Only Prochnow adds a touch of class to an otherwise struggling movie, perfectly cast in his role as a veteran smuggler. In summary, whilst some good bits and pieces are in here this movie ends up as much less than the sum of its parts."
1,This was Horrible,"This movie hasn't even finished playing yet, and I just have to write this review.This movie is god awful, there is not one single redeeming quality to this movie.Believe me when I say it, the best part of this movie is the cover art for the DVD.AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!!!"
1,total waste,"avoid at all costs. there's not one redeeming quality about a movie such as this one.not even the occasionally ""so bad it's funny""...it is simply BAD.now you may still want to be a sucker (i'd rather use the term looser) and rent it anyway. your problem.judging from the other reviews, i'd say you've been amply warned..."
1,"Worst movie ever! No, really!","This hunk of junk makes Batman and Robin look like an Oscar worthy epic. I was expecting a fun zombie flick that I could enjoy. Instead, I got horrible acting, horrible plot, horrible visuals - even the nude scenes were bad. The video game clips were dumb, too. It was unbelievable. Never in my life have I seen a worse movie. Don't buy it, don't steal it, don't rent it, don't even recommend it to your enemies, because they'll kill you. The only reason I gave it one star is because there isn't a zero star option."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS.,This has got to be the worst zombie movie in all of movie history.The concept was very promising but the movie fell flat on its face.The acting was horrible and there are many things in the movie which dont add up.The video game clips all throughout the movie are very annoying and the matrix effects are a blatant ripp off.Please dont buy this movie because it is a poor excuse for a horror movie.
1,pretty bad,"it was just bad,everything looks fake. the dead can jump far and you can see why, in some scenes you can see the catapults. in the dark forests they are even lit. i rented it and i regret it, the only good thing is that i did not pay to see it in the movies."
1,House of tha stupid,"where do I begen. The fil flat out sucks, avoid it. itz tha most retarted thing I ever saw. How could the people that made this take this serious. The acting is garbage, the gore looks like it was digitaly added, the blood is dark pink. don't rent it don't buy it, this movie is the worst zombie I have ever seen. so avoid it, or you will die of stupididy.Since they don't let you give it a zero, Thats why It has a 1This movie sucks"
1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"I had originally heard some good things about HOD and was looking forward to watching a fun action packed movie, but after viewing it I was really disappointed. I mean this movie had no plot, or any redeeming quality about it. About the first 5 minutes into it I thought ok it has to get better, but no it actually get worse..Way worse! Do yourself a favor and please don't rent this movie."
1,90 Minutes of my life that I will NEVER get back!!!!!!,"I rented this piece of crap hoping that it would be somewhat like the game. Instead they made it into a horror movie like any other teenage horror flick. I mean how many ""let get drunk,make some corny jokes, have sex, oops I died"" teenage horror movies do we need? Hell thats why we have Friday the 13th around right? Not every other horror movie made needs to be about some over sexed teenagers.Here are somethings I found wrong with this movie1.The zombies look so very very fake2.Acting was BADDDDDDD3.The story line was horrible4.It needed to be more like the gameThe list goes on and on, but you all get the point. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY MOVIE!! RENT SOMETHING ELSE!!!"
4,Erica Durance aka Lois Lane in Smallville is topless!,"Ok the movie is not so great. 1 Star for that. I give another star for the meaningless topless scenes. However, Erica Durance topless scenes warrants 2 stars. She is hot as Lois Lane in Smallville. I guess sales of this DVD might rise a bit because of this. Enjoy..."
1,Survivor Meets Dawn of the Dead,"My friend likes this movie so I watched it with him. I truely don't know what's up with him because I just couldn't get into this movie. He kept watching for my reactions during the film and I had to put on the best act of my life. I wanted to bash the DVD player in the whole time it was playing. I kept making excuses to leave the room, and then I would keep asking ""Did Liberty die yet?, did Liberty die yet? Finally she did and that was the most monumental thing in the entire movie. This film is horrible!!!!!"
1,Pure Crap!,This has got to be the worst zombie movie i have ever seen (and iv'e seen a lot of them). Everything about this movie is bad! This movie is a disgrace to horror films! Whatever you do... Don't buy this crap!!!!
1,Such a disapointment,"What can i say about this film, well its based on the arcade game house of the dead, i use this term loosely, because the name is where the similarity ends. Such a disapointment they could of made this into such a phat film, they had the perfect catalyst and they decided to burn it, literally.It seems as if Uwe Boll has never actually played the game and watched what was happening on the screen, there are plenty of references to it in the film, but in the wrong way, flashing up screen shots of the game throughout is an eye saw and lazy.The sound in this film goes in and out so much youd think a child had been there playing with the mute button on a remote, the bullit-time shots were used inappropriately, it gets tediously boring and the acting, dont get me started.The film is supposed to be set on an island and yet it is claustrophobic, the story is hazy at best and extremely poor.""THE GAME HAS JUST BEGUN"" yer and your career has probably ended."
1,Wow,"The plot sucks; the acting (if it can even be deemed as such) is horrible; and there are no redemptive qualities whatsoever. Several moments jumped the film to low-budget, soft-core porn and I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more if it continued the scenes and actually was a porn. It was AWFUL. The random transitions using clips from the arcade game were just ridiculous...the whole film was truly idiotic and just really, REALLY bad. Filmmaking at its WORST! I can't believe I'm typing this, but this movie made Freddie vs. Jason seem Oscar-worthy. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. You actually are rooting for the zombies the finish off the cast so you can go home. I implore you all, don't go."
1,How the hell did this make it in theaters?..,"House of the Dead is probably one of the ""funniest"" films ever made...even though it's not ment to be..Uwe Bole should really stop thinking about making video game films cause this isn't cutting it for me, atleast he isn't making the Resident Evil films. The Zombies in this film are so friggin' funny you have to see it for yourself...This film also has some really, really, really stupid moments like when a character dies they make it seem as if it's like ""YOU DIED"" LIKE a video game which is just lame. Something that was really funny about House of the Dead is that the Cast is just plain stupid, they say some pretty stupid stuff in this film and do some pretty stupid stunts in slow motion with some really bad ""Rock"" music...I'm not gonna go on except to say that This is one of the worst films ever...And possibly funniest...even though it's not ment to be..1.1 out of 5 stars.."
1,Hardest review I've ever done,"After much thinking I decided to give this a grade based on the quality of the movie. This is one of the most terrible movies made in recent times. The director Uwe Boll has been repeatedly compared to Ed Wood and I can't say that I think that's unfair. All that said, I have seen this movie four times. This is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. The trick to enjoying this movie is you get a bunch of your friends together and pull an ""MST3K"", I promise you will not run out of material. So I actually love this movie the way people love ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". I am looking forward to Alone in the Dark, Bloodrayne, Far Cry, Dungeon Seige, Fear Effect, Hunter the Reckoning and possibly others that Uwe Boll is making."
1,how in gods great earth do you make a film this bad,"ok bad acting,bad storyline,zombies talk?, walk without their heads,bad special effects, everything that could b rong with a movie went wrond with this movie. i was suprised i didnt see any of the cast working during filming of the movie"
1,hated it so annoyly bad,this movie had the most annoying charaters with the worst acting. had bad props had bad every thing it just sucked so much. maybe if it was an older movie I would have liked it more but it just annoyed the hell out of me
1,Crap!,"The only reason I give this one star is because amazon won't let us go into negatives. Bottom line, Uwe Boll should've had his camera smashed after this one, who's the idiot who let him make Alone in the Dark? Who are the morons greenlighting other video games for him to ruin on film? If you're in the mood to lose an hour and a half of your life that you'll desperately want back, then check this one out! :)"
1,BAD,Avoid this film like the plague. I would give this film lower than one star but there is no rating for that. This film is even worse than Gigli. The acting in the film and dilogue are horrible.The plot of the film is also bad. Fans of the video game will not even like this movie.Video games that are made into film are usually never good but this is the worst movie ever. The film doesn't even take the same setting or plot as the video game. It just took the title of the game and added little footage from the game into the film. By the end of this you will be laughing at it for being so bad. It is not even worth watching it for free on cable tv. The only thing that could be worse than this is a sequel.
1,if any one can think of some thing wores tell me,"this is by far the worst horror movie ever. wait you know what I changed my mind its the worst movie ever. this cinimatic pice of barf lack plot, charecters, gore. jesse this movie is just so good at being bad. I give it 1 star because I cant give it o. if you wish to find a defice that can torture some one than pick up the dvd and force them to watch it."
1,Holy Crap!,"I can't believe I actually watched this movie till the end. The only saving grace for me was that I enjoyed some of the soundtrack. This movie was not ""funny bad"":, or maybe ""so bad you gotta see it-bad"".....oh,no! House of the Dead is just ""don't see it bad"".Unless you are just a true fan of crappy movies, then don't waste your time!"
2,DEATH TO VIDEO GAMES,"WOW. This movie sure did get panned by our fellow reviewers, didn't it? And I can see why. The interspersion of the SEGA videogame and the unabashedly bold marketing therein only adds more fuel to the ""let's stop making video game movies."" Even usually ""fun"" actors like Jonathan Cherry, Will Sanderson, Jurgen Prochnow and the ubiquitous Clint Howard can't save this fiasco. Lots of zombie gore but no real thrills or intelligence. Avoid unless you like stupid zombies."
1,This could be one of the worst movie I have ever seen.,I would love to tell you all that I love seeing crappy video games made into crappy movies. I was at best buy last year and picked up The House of The Dead. I went wow this could be scary.But no it was one that god had dammed to the firey pits of the 4 dollar bin. I am serious because this movie sucked so bad that it was really really funny instead of scary. Dont ever buy this movie. If you have to see it watch it at a friends house that was stupid enough to buy and enjoy this piece of crap flim by a terrible director.
1,Not unlike fungus infection...,"It's just about as pleasant an experience.No, wait - I take it back. Did I actually compare poor fungus to uweboll's ""House of the Dead""? I apologize - a fungus infection is an experience far superior to watching uweboll's ""film"". Additionally, fungus has much more taste, intelligence and talent (not to mention better command of English) than uweboll will ever have, even if he dies and gets reincarnated as Howard Hawks (and that is because he would still be uweboll then, only in Hawks's body).(I assume uweboll got a Green Card in order to be able to find work slaughtering movies in USA. Surely it can be revoked, if there is any justice in the world?)"
1,when will amazon put negative stars on these reviews,"O.K I've been wantin to see this movie in theaters and saw it, I looked back at my self and litteraly slapped myself. This movie was horriable.It was a waste of the $12 I spent to go see it. I demanded my money back but never got it. The acting HORRABLE, the sx HORRABLE,the plot, what plot. This movie was a waste of time,money and respect to zombie movies. The zombies looked like people wraped in green leaf covered tolit papar. I,m sure the makeup people wrapped the stuntmen in tolitpapar like I siad, put some red lipstick on them and told em to get out there. I think that there should be a law about lettin European people deriect movies. They mostly have no sceans when makin a movie andd no one can understand them. Buy this movie for target practice for a shotgun, not for watching."
1,House of the Dead.....Asleep after viewing this movie,"Words can't justify how painfully bad this movie is. I am a huge Clint Howard fan, and I love bad movies to boot. But this film is just AWFUL!! There really is no story, no scares, not much blood, and not enough Clint Howard. The Zombie makeup was a joke, they looked like standard Wal-Mart quality Zombie masks, and like other reviewers, I hated they way the spliced in scenes from the video games. I knew I was in trouble watching this movie when one of the hapless party goers gets thrown up on as an excuse to for a gratuitous boob shot! Not even MST3K could save this drivel!"
2,I'm the most generous...,"I'll start by saying that I do agree with most of the reviewers here, the movie was really bad. One of the stars I gave is for the good looking cast, unfortunately they can't act at all. Only at the beginning of the movie there are a few moments that makes you jump reason why I gave another star (2 in total), but after that, the movie gets ridiculous, no action, no good video effects (they ran out of $$ I bet) bad acting gets even more stupid, the fighting is horrendous, and the scenes of the game included in the movie don't help at all, instead they make it worst. At the end I was laughing so much, not because it's a good funny movie, but because I could not believe I was watching such an idiotic movie that I spent $8.00 to own. That been said, the only reason to watch it, is to laugh while you discover all the fails and lacks in directing, acting, editing, etc"
5,HA HA.,"You know, I've seen some really bad movies in my life but... THIS WASN'T ONE OF THEM!!!... I shut the movie off after 10 minutes, why the heck did you guys keep watching it???It serves you right to have actually sat through this film, you guys are as smart as the actors in this movie for that brilliant choice!!!HA HA, I only wasted 10 minutes of my life on this film, that makes me one of 297 (reviewers at the time this one was written)!!! HA HA.You guys are right, this movie is hilarious, it gets people to waste about 2 hrs of their lives watching it, then another two-five minutes to review it!!!(no offense...)I just hope that this director someday makes a movie based on the Animal Crossing video game, that would be awesome!!!"
1,Beyond bad,"I figured House of the Dead wouldn't be anything special when it was released, but man oh man, it was worse than I could have ever fathomed. Filled with terrible acting, plot holes galore, a poor script, poor direction, and incoherent action; House of the Dead isn't even one of those movies that's so bad it's good, it's just plain bad. The flashes of shots from the Sega video game that inspired it are completely unnecessary to say the least, and the look of the film as a whole is just plain dumb. Poor Jürgen Prochnow (Das Boot, In the Mouth of Madness) is stuck in the film as the captain of the boat (his last name is Kirk, hardy har) and Clint ""brother of Ron"" Howard is his perfectly weird mate, while Jonathan Cherry (Final Destination 2) is the only other recognizeable actor in this whole mess. Horror and zombie fans, this movie isn't worth a look one bit, it's easy to see why this was laughed out of theaters."
5,HAAAAAAA HAAA OH MY GOS THIS SUCKED!,MOST WORST DUMBEST MOVIE OF 2003 THE MOVIE SUCKS ITS JUST I CNAT EXPLAIN IT AL THEY DO IS WALK AROUND GOING HAAA BAD ACTORS DAWN OF THE DEAD DOESNT EVEN COMPARE TO THIS MOVIE IM STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHATS WORST THIS MOVIE OR LEPERCAHUN BACK IN THE HOOD CAUSE THAT MOVIE SUCKED TO THEY JUST CANT MAKE GAMES INTO MOVIES THEY ALWAYS TURN OUT BAD AND SUCKY I HERED SUPER MARIO BROS. THE MOVIE LOST CL;OSE TO 30 MILLION YEAH BUT THAT MOVIE WAS AWESOME I DONT CARE WHAT THEY SAYTHE POINT IS I LOVE VIDEO GAMES IM CHARLIE V1 BUT THIS MOVIE DOSENT CUT IT NEVER RENT IT OR BUY IT IF YOU DO YOU WILL REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IT WORKS IN YOUR DVD PLAYER WOW BEST PART ABOUT THE MOVIE BUT THE GAME CAUSE THE GAME ROCKS THIS MOVIE SUCKS!
1,Soooooo much trash....,"I really can't believe that somebody gave this the green light. The plot, cinematogrophy, acting, actors...ah everything sucked. Bah!"
2,Give it a break!,"What do the people expect out of a movie that is based on a real shooting arcade game? We all know that lately, most of the horror movies suck now in these days, don't they?."
1,Avoid this movie at all cost!!!!,"Worst Movie Ever!!! - I'm a big movie buff. I've watched many movies, both good and many bad. Even most of the bad movies have some redeeming quality, feature, or theme that make them tolerable. This movie has none. This movie has the silliest plot, the corniest actors, and horrible special effects. Do yourself a favor and avoid this flick."
1,How much more lame can you get!!,"I mean seriously what were they thinking when they made this movie!! Have you ever watched a movie an when it was over just thought, ""why did I waste an hour in a half"" Well that's exactly how this movie will make you feel. Pathetic story, nothin like the games, not even close. Most games made into a movie somewhat follow the story to the game, this one is far from it. And the cutscenes to the actual gameplay really do not work, really really lame idea by the writers. And how come all of a sudden you hve ordinary teenagers, who become weapon experts! Do not waste your time with this movie!! don't make the mistake I did of wasting an hour to two hours of your time!"
1,Couldn't be any worse,"When I rented this movie I expected a transition from video game to movie screen much like that of Resident Evil. However, this movie was unable to shake its video game roots. First, they spliced in snips from the game just reminding the viewerthat this was based off the game. They also do this because they probably ran out of money after filming the lengthy shoot-em-up sequence. The big fight to the house was about 5 minutes too long and used the bullet time poorly.The costumes were ok, but the acting was absolutely terrible. The amount of boobs were over the top and placed too closely together.Not scary, not funny, not worth the time."
1,"The ""Gigli"" of horror films!","Wow, where do i begin? You know what..let's just get straight to the point; poor script, poor acting, poor fight sequences (if you wanna call them that!) and last but not least..poor me!Now i saw that they're are reviewers who actually liked this film, and that is possible because we all got different tastes but i sat and watched this movie with my little brother who is 13 and likes any movie that has zombies,blood,and a little t&a in it...and i realized if your over 20 and know what real zombie films are supposed to look like (28 days days,resident evil,new and old night of the living dead and of course dawn and day)..you really won't like this film at all!So the rest is up too you...but remember you've been warned!!"
1,Couldn't finish watching it...twice!,"Wow, if i could of given this movie no stars..i would of. My girlfriend hates all horror films because they freak her out, even Jason and Freddy got her scared but when she saw this masterpiece she couldn't stop laughing!Listen i didn't expect much from this picture when i rented it..maybe a few scares, laughs, and something to talk about with friends who like these type of movies but nothing! Worst acting i've ever seen, worst editing, worst video game to movie presentation since ""super mario brothers"" which for the money is much better.Too bad they couldn't stay with the video game story then totally change with people on an island at a rave (which in the film was supposed to be the biggest party ever...seemed like there was 50 people!) that get killed by zombies.I'm not even sorry i didn't watch the last 30 minutes..it was that bad....what a shame, Great Game...Brutal film.Don't go to the house of the dead..it's a real lousy place!!"
1,Don't waste your time!,What are you looking at! Why are you still reading this?I 've already made the mistake and wasted my time on this rubbish.You expect me to write a real review for this junk?Go watch Dawn of the Dead or Shaun of the Dead.
3,?????,this is a really bad movie bad acting.it doesnt make eny sence the only good part is erica durance from smallviles nude scene
3,zombies!!!!!!!!!!!,this is about a bunch of yuppie kids who go to an rave on a deserted island to find a post zombie feast.this film has a lot of video game like graphics in place of the violence.that is really stupid!does anyone big ever play in horror films?this is way too much for the kids.sometimes there are long stretches without much action.its better than what people say.the special effects suck!i really hope it future is dead.
1,DUMMIEST MOVIE EVER AND I'M NOT LYING!,I SAW THIS MOVIE AND IT AIN'T WORTH ANYTHING. I MEAN DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS I'M TELLING ALL WHO ARE READING THIS AND HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MOVIE AS DUMB AS THIS IT LOOKS AS IF IT WAS MADE BY A 13 YEAR OLD. USUALLY I'M ALWAYS IMPRESSED BY SCARY MOVIES WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE SCARY BUT THIS ONE ABOUSULTLEY SUCKED. TO ME THIS MOVIE IS ONLY WORTH $0.99. SO DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE FOR NOT EVEN $20.00
1,words cannot express this movie throughly,"the words i would like to use i cannot because it would be too vulgar to let this review be posted on this site. so the ones i have to use dont even come close to expressing this movie and its total stupid plot and crappy cast, acting, ect...i stopped watching it after the 1st 45 minutes! I wanted to pluck my eyes out and bash my head against the neartest wall! this is one that can be passed over by ANYONE! not even scary in the least! This was a waste of my 3 dollars anda waste of the millions it took to make it! in 2 words...it sucked!!!pass it up! even cabin fever is better than this!!!!!"
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made!!,"This movie made Street Fighter look like a masterpiece. Every time I thought it couldn't get worse, it did. The special effects consisted of spliced in clips from House of the Dead 2 the video game. The plot was terrible. Pornos have better scripts. It's not even bad in an amusing sort of way. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! DO NOT LET YOUR FRIENDS WATCH THIS MOVIE."
1,Perhaps the worst horror film ever,"This movie is ZERO stars. To begin, the director uses quick cuts to actual video game footage to save on the special effects when killing zombies ( which look like people in burlap sacks ). Also, there is extensive use of a 360 degree camera shot - which makes the movie seem stupid and dizzying. The acting is HORRIBLE - lines that don't make any sense and you never feel bad for them because they are so STUPID. The writing is even worse - there is no continuity in the movie at all. It is 1 1/2 hours of my life I'll never get back. DO NOT SEE THIS IDIOTIC film. It's not scary, sexy, or entertaining in any way."
2,"Mind Numbing, Cult Movie Entertainment........","This is one of the most laugh out loud non-intentional comedies I have seen in a while. It was so bad, I loved it. This will be a cult classic for sure.House of the Dead will make you really think that a group of MTV Real World cast members could pick up shotguns and turn into some Kung Fu masters. ""I was an underwear model, now I'm Charles Bronson.......Let's kick some zombie butt!"" Wow, I'm cracking up just thinking about it."
3,The most faithful video game to movie adaptation,"It is ironic when you think about it, the most faithful video game to movie adaptation and it is also one of the poorer ones.House of the Dead is about a group of people who go to a rave on an island but ultimatly get destroyed by Zombies. There is a lot of gunplay and explosions but surprisingly little gore.For anyone who has played the games know that the games are ultimatly about blasting zombies and in essence that is what the movie went ahead and did. It is an hour and a half of Zombies getting blasted and zliced and diced with some gratiouse nudity thrown in to maintain the R rating."
1,House of the Dead directors cut,"House of the Dead directors cut is funny and entertaining. That's why I ordered it, unfortunatly gohastings shipped me the regular movie not the directors cut. When I called the customer service number they told me all they could do was issue me a refund (which will take around three weeks to go back into my account) and let me keep the wrong movie they sent me. That would be great if I actually wanted the regular movie, but I don't (I don't think anyone does since it's selling for only $.01)My confirmation e-mail told me they shipped me the directors cut, but obviously they didn't. I'm writing this review just to warn others to be ware of what they order. If it is shipped from gohastings you may not get what they tell you you're going to get."
1,ouch my eyes,"This movie is the first movie that I have actually regretted seeing. It was absolutely terrible. The movie had no plot, terrible effects and horrible acting. If you really feel compelled to see this movie just take ten dollars out of your wallet and wipe your butt with it, its about the same experience."
1,Holy Crap...Worst Movie ever made,"This movie really deserves negative stars. The director and produces of this movie should be banned from making any movies. I swear this movie was very very bad.....heck sayin bad is really an understatement. very bad acting(makes soap stars oscar worthy actors), bad plot, bad direction, bad everything. The funniest part that got me rolling was the matrix wannabe scene. I had to eventually leave the theather because i was the only one left. I can't even describe how bad this movie was."
2,Am I being generous?,"It's so bad Troma wouldn't sell it. If you want to see a zombie flick that's so bad it's hillariously good, I reccomend Troma's ""Redneck Zombies from Outer Space."" If you want to see a GOOD zombie movie, get Romeros ""Dawn of the Dead"" (the one from the 70s, the remake was kinda dissapointing in the fact that only the make-up & special effects were better). I feel Sorry for Mr. Boll though; he has plenty of ambition & keeps trying & trying, but people who work with him say that he doesn't accept criticism, is stubborn, & is difficult to work with. Maybe one day he'll listen & make something good."
1,"What the hell is this movie, this ruins a great game.","Its not a movie...this...thing.Its a real scrap thing.This is suposed to be a greatest hit, this is the worst thing i never view.Actor are really poor.They make too many sacrifice.Zombie not freaky,bad story and you will lose 1:30 hurs of your life."
1,Jurgen Prochnow at his best!,"First off, here is the best and wittiest quote from this movie. Are you ready for wit? Imagine, if you will, this wonderful line of dialogue being delivered by super serious german actor Jurgen Prochnow as he is dressed up like the gorton's fisherman and chomping a cigar with such gusto that even the oldest sea salts up in Maine or Guam would be jealous. Ready? Here we go!*Captain Victor Kirk: What do you think I am trying to do you f'ing moron...*That's it. That line is the zenith of humor in this movie. Granted, this isn't marketed as a comedy, and doesn't even have value as a movie to drink beer and make fun of, the fact that amazon chose that quote as the only one fit to print under the ""quotes"" section says alot.If this movie had more than three dollars spent on it, we should be rioting in the streets until movies that are actually good start being made. Today, I feel ashamed to be an american."
1,"BAD ACTING & BAD DIALOG, when will it end ?","*House of the Dead(2003)*...A TOTAL FLOP! There are some really neat special effects and camera tricks that really could have made this a classic zombie flick. It's just that all the horrible acting and pointless dialog, which infected this movie from beginning to end, made it almost impossible to watch. Even Clint Howard A.K.A. Chahka(Ron Howards brother) is terrible in this ""horrorible"" flick!To me, the scariest thing about House of the Dead is the DVD cover! I'm very dissapointed and would NOT recommend this to anyone with a brain, except the jokers that approved, produced and made it. They should be forced to watch it over and over for at least a week straight. Perhaps, after really watching their own poison, they'll stop releasing these horrible movies? They should also be forced to pay us back for our time and money. I've got an idea, how about a class-action lawsuit?I give it 2 thumbs DOWN and THE FINGER!"
1,I wanted to like it,"I love zombie movies. Generally, I can find even the most horrible horror flick watchable. Unfortunately, House Of The Dead was so wretched that I was counting the seconds until it ended.The plot is vague at best, the acting is worse than a grade school play and they include effects that should have been left in the video game.I can safely say that this is in the worst zombie movie I have ever seen."
1,"STUPID, STUPID, STUPID...","Fifteen seconds into this worthless flick and I was hoping some zombie would put me out of my misery. Ridiculous effects, moronic dialogue, amateur acting, and a limping storyline forces this film to self-destruct almost before it begins. It's not even a slight addition to the modern horror genre, which is comprised of goose eggs as it is. Save your money, unless you're the small audience it's aimed at: Intellectually challenged boneheads."
1,House of Crapola,"I am actually stunningly amazed at how much that sucked. I felt compelled to watch the featturette basically looking for some sort of an appology from the creators of the film. Alas I was again disappointed. It was astounding how seriously the creators took this movie, comparing it to Romero's movies. It kind of makes me laugh that the ancient spanish conquestidors that were brought back from the dead all new kung fu and moved as stealthy as breakdancers."
1,worst movie I've ever seen,"no joke, this movie was the worst movie i've ever seen. it is the stupidest idea ever to put parts of the video game into the movie. they actually did it and it looked completely gaytarded. if you liked this movie, you need to be shot for being so stupid. if you made this movie, please kill yourself for wasting so many people's valuable time and never even walk into a movie theater again. PEACE!!"
5,Yerba prima fiber plus,"I'm happy with this product, I've used it before and it works for me. Now I'm a regular guy, he he..."
2,"Good Evidence, Bad Story Teller","I couldn't wait to receive my book, ""The Great Lie..."" The subject has long interested me. I read excerpts from the book on line. After getting the book and starting to read it, I became frustrated with the writing style. Although the content is facinating, and the research I feel is well done, it doesn't flow from page to page. Kalopoulos seems to be a good researcher but he's no writer. I feel this material would be better understood if properly put into print by and expeirenced writer. having said that I do appreciate his efforts and will try to get through it again in a couple of weeks or so. When I come across books like this I like to give them three or four chances before tossing them out. As I said in my title of this reveiw, ""There's a good story in there but badly told."
2,Big Error,I want to make it clear that I'm an atheist.Every ancient civilization had myths and religions. Why wouldn't the jews have myths as well?Myths are tales of supernatural things that of course never happened.This book while exposing the bible tries at the same time to explain God's feats as if they were really true. The explanation is of course improbable which makes the book lose a lot of credibility.That was a big error.
1,Michael Kalopoulos = Great Lier,"The book is a total nonsense. The Bible should be a total lie, but the author recognizes the existance of the biblical characters Abraham, Lot, Moses a.o.Further, the author's rich hilarous imagination makes Abraham a chemistry expert, who uses his expertise in poisons to create ""plagues"" in the households of the Egyptians and Philistines and provides Lot with sodium hydroxide or calcium oxide dust, which was used to blind the men of Sodom !!! Oh, please!!!Moses was accused of enacting the death of the Egyptian firstborn with ""dietary segregation. Only for the firstborn! What happend to the secondborn and the other Egyptian Mr. Author?"
1,Worst Experience with this product,"I was a user of Systemworks 2003 and had very few problems but with this one,I paid a hefty sum and after installation and going thru stupid activation,The main Systemworks 2004 window or any of the utilities would not come up.I spent one whole week going thru their website support and other work arounds,scans uninstalling 2003 and cleaning every directory and reinstalling 2004 but nothing worked.Finally I have decided to return the software.They make such crappy products and they do not have phone support for atleast 30 days.You need to pay to tell how their product stinks.Never buy this product.Even if it works for you,**BEWARE***You are going to be in big trouble if you have one minor incident later."
5,House and Home Signs for being Helpful,"Purchased this DVD to help my students understand the signing of a classmate. We all enjoy the many Signing Time DVDs, they are topic specific, last about half an hour. Real children are shown sighing, so children have many opportunities to read the signs on other children's hands. Very beneficial to us. Purchased used in excellent condition. Covers common chores and activities around the home."
5,terrific read for an engineer,"As an interested automotive engineer, I thought this was a terrific read. It starts with a historical account of the development in the understanding of railway dynamics, which is an excellent way to move from simple to complex concepts. There are chapters on wheel/ rail contact, longitudinal dynamics, noise, derailment, as well as test and simulation techniques.One minor quibble is the fact that because different chapters have been written by different people, it gets repetitive at times.Shame about the price."
2,Beware: the CDs are full of remakes,"I bought this CD thinking that it was compilation of of pretty good songs from a whole bunch of different artists. Little did I know that they are all remakes by The Obscure. They sound sort of similar to the original, but if I had known this was full of remakes, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,This is so bad! Its still not any good.,"Perez Prado, Rosemary Clooney, Sway! One of the top 42 Hits of 1999? How big a fool do they think we are! This was a hit in 1959, 51 years ago my lord.Most of the rest of this junk is just plain bad. 1999 was a very poor year and in particular if judged on this collection. England exported some good artists in the sixties but not anymore in any quantity. Its to small a market in any case for all these repeat greatest hits collections.Latin Pop Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca is here and a couple of other oldies but this doesn't show case anything I what to hear.This isn't worth ripping to my computer collection. Save your money..."
1,Don't Even Bother,"Skip this CD full of some group appropriately called The Obscure covering a group of current hits. Instead, look in Amazon for the similarly named Big Hits 99 in the import section. It's a 2-CD set from England that contains the ORIGINAL versions of hits by Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Lou Bega (Mambo #5), Backstreet Boys, Brandy, Sixpence None the Richer and many more.The UK CD is more expensive, but a Grand Victoria costs more than a Lada, too. Which would you rather own?"
2,Aww - It's not really sooo bad!,"Another review of this disc found it lacking in content and vocal quality, but I personally found it light and fluffy! This collection includes Debbie's smash 50's hit ""Tammy"", a breathy teeny-bopper concoction with a cheesy string arrangement that serves as an exemplary period piece (if you're looking for throw-away pop). If a listener were looking for something more adult or with more depth, perhaps Sarah Vaughn or Julie London or Ella would be more your speed. I'd advise would-be buyers to listen to the song samples on the amazon site before purchasing, just in case this type of pop/kitsch isn't your `cup of tea'.Finally, I thought the recording quality was quite good. Her production team seems to have put a good deal of time into these arrangements, thought they are a little syrupy for my taste. Good luck!!"
1,This ani't your singing in the rain Debbie,"Well, this is absolutly the worst cd I have ever bought - poor song selections, thin vocals, poor recording, washed out quality. Oh well, I still luv ya Debbie! just stick to her movies."
4,man go pick it up if u tired of the same ole thang,"look, this cd, is worth buying. they got a diffrent flow, the beat are tight. just click on the song they got up at the trck listings and hear it for urself, alright.and yea go get that new snoop,project pat,silk the shocker,and that brotha lynch hung EBK4. 3rd coast in the house fa sho, texas baby"
3,the explicit is better,I love the first album but sensored is just not my thing I love the people who just curse even when it is not needed.
2,okay album,"This is an OKAY album , The single ""Get F**k Up"" aka ""Get krump Up"" is good for clubs, parties or to roll to but if this is what you like get this Cd. It not nothing spectular about this CD but good beats and one good rapper and no, it is not that garbage female. So if you like club rap all the time pick it up. It is nothing like 3-6 Mafia , not sayin they are the best out but they had get variety on ""when the smoke clears"". This ICONZ CD is worth a dubb or a cd single."
1,Not worth it,"Turtles need a MUCH stronger filter and this one is very cheap. Some of the plastic broke on mine right away. The book is more like a pamphlet you can get for free at most pet stores. Everything else is fine, but it is definitely not worth buying."
5,A great treat with a unique essence,"My favorites have been Paloma Picasso's ""Minotaure"" and Givenchy's ""PI."" Now, Fahrenheit is a welcome addition to my repertoire of scents.I don't often splurge on an almost hundred dollar luxury, but I'm glad I got the 6.8 oz. size as I feel I can use it more often with a big bottle. The smell is so pleasing, not quite as sweet as my former favorites, and it lasts a long time.I've gotten more than a few compliments on this."
3,Classic Fragrance,"Wish I would have gotten a smaller bottle for travel purposes, but the price was so perfect, I couldn't pass it up. Next I will get a smaller travel size."
4,My lovely Ray Ban,I am in love with my glasses.. I used this brand for ever and ever.. I want to buy another one with metal gold.
3,Tinnnny.,"Ah, these were too small for me. I've always considered my head size to be small but that doesn't mean these will look right on you. Service was great but unfortunately had to return. I ended up getting the larger size and I am a happy camper."
4,Really small frames,"These glasses are for small and thin faces, I don't think they can fit to men. Arista frame is gold but not too yellow, which I liked. They seem pretty well made."
3,Too small,I have a narrow face and hoped these would fit better than other glasses. Unfortunately they were too small even for me.
4,Ray-Ban 3044 sunglasses,"They came in good unharmed condition but it took two and a half weeks to get them in on stardard ups shipping. That was my biggest disappointment, that and the lenses are really more of a blue gray then blue the picture does not do the product justice. I woul buy from ts edhem again because I though overall the product came good and clean. That and o my fortunate surprise they were a made in Italy pair not China so that was a bonus."
5,"If its sunglasses, its Ray Ban","I have been looking for the perfect sunglasses for a long time now and I must say this model (RB 3044 Aviator Small Metal L2848 Black/Crystal Grey Sunglasses) is the best I have purchased.The aviator is one of the fashionable sun glasses in the world and to own one and especially one that fits your face perfectly is a pleasure. I have a small face and this one fits perfect.The one thing I accidentally got to test was its ruggedness. Despite falling on the ground on a couple of occasions, the glasses are intact and in good condition. Fortunately no scratches yet."
1,too heavy,"I didn't like these glasses, they were very heavy and the bows were too long for my head.Also didn't like vendor. They charge a 15% restocking fee. DO NOT ORDER FROM CLE!!!"
1,Too small,"Don't buy this product unless your a 10 year old!! It's too small even with a small face like I am. I should gave returned it, but the shipping cost is over $20. Just buy the rb3025 for it fits most faces for just $10 more"
1,Don't Buy from Sunglass Express,"Sunglass Express hides specific ""terms and conditions"" for returns & exchanges (15% restocking fee, inconsistent specifications from what is stated online & delivery invoice, etc.). Product description-sizes, colors, etc. not clear/accurate (must see RayBan official website to decipher). Although I followed all requirements, didn't receive requested response confirming my credit was issued. Will never purchase from Sunglass Express again!"
2,Size is much smaller than i thought!!,I wanted to buy this glasses because the other pair i bought was kind a big. So i thought Small Metal would fit better. But it is much smaller than i thought. So be careful about the size. Other than that product is very good.
1,"your site display wrong info, is not gray is green i am very unhappy with my purchase","your site display wrong info, is not gray is green lens and gold frame i am very unhappy with my purchase"
2,too small for adults,"I did like the size of the lenses. (small and light). The frames, however, were too small for an adult. The width of the lense is not the problem. The frame was the issue. I had measured my old frames, and it was not that much different. But a small difference in frame width is all it takes."
3,Very small glasses!,"While awesome, these are preposterously small. I have a fairly tiny face, and yet they still looked like they were for a 10 year old. While an awesome style, any adult really needs to buy the large metal aviators."
4,"beautiful glasses, but have to return","These glasses are nice, but REALLY small..would be a better fit for a really small face or even a child."
2,"Great pair of shades for my 3 year old, not me!","i thought that a petite asian lady with a small oval face would have fit in this pair of ""small"" aviator sunglasses based on the specs given. when i first tried on the shades, i knew immediately that this one would be going to my 3-year-old. it's just way too small."
2,Cool only for very small faces,"I thought I had a fairly small face and so then ordered the 3044... They turned out to be way too small. I ended up exchanging them for the 3025's I hope they work for me. In conclusion, you need to have a very small face in order for these shades to work."
1,FOR KIDS!!!,"This glasses are for KIDS!! Really small.. should say somewhere that this is kids sized. I`m really desapointed, bought before a trip and was just a headache having to send it back on a weekend."
3,just a little too small,"Great quality sunglasses. I am petite and was very excited to find that these aviators in a smaller size, but alas these frames were too small for my head. I ended up returning the sunglasses....my quest continues..."
1,reclamos,"si tuviera que darles una puntuación no la tendrían ya que llevo dos meses esperando un pedido y nada; lo último que me informaron es que llegarían a mi casa la semana pasada y ya hoy es miércoles 09/02/2011 y nada; quisiera por favor me dieran la dirección para ir personalmente a buscarlos, tengo entendido tienen una oficina en la castellana-altamira caracas Venezuela..."
2,Ray-Ban RB3044 L0207 Arista (Gold) Sunglasses,I recently bought two of these sunglasses and they are too small.Honestly I felt so disappointed and just don't returned because they are not for me.But for $68 I'm pure sure that I can get a better sun-glass.
4,small ray-bans - worked out,"I set out looking for a medium sized ray-ban aviator (55mm). The 58 mm's look silly on me. While the 55's would probably work, I had trouble finding a decent selection of them anywhere. The small ray-bans look like children's sunglasses. Infact, they fit my 8 year old perfectly! I am not petite, but have a narrow oval face (am 5'8"" 130 lbs)and they do work for me. While I am basically satisfied with the product, I wouldn't say they are perfect as they are quite small. The logistics of shipping, etc...all worked out great too."
2,I did not like the color of the lens,"In the picture on amazon lens glasses are dark, But surprise surprise the glasses have arrived ... Came to my country glasses (Colombia) and I can not refund are clear lens.....I'm sad about that"
5,great item!,These are real raybans for a cheaper cost! I love them! Shipment was fast and transaction was very smooth. Definitely recommend:)
3,"Yes, very small!","My wife has a small face, so she requested these for Christmas. I read the reviews and expected these to be quite small.. but after they came in the mail, they were so small that I had to have my wife try them on. They were just too small and had to be returned. The shades were great quality, but I agree with other users that they should be reserved for children."
1,not received.,"i'm not received this product. they had more items in stock, but I got my money back again. I still want to buy this item."
1,Wrong size,I love Ray Bans and wanted a new pair...only the ones I ordered were not marked JR Ray Bans so didn't realize I would get a children's size.
3,ray ban rb3044 L0207,"I'm an asian chinese gal with an absolute small, narrow and long face. Received these in less than 1 wk, was absolutely happy abt tat. The glass are perfect fit for me in terms of the size. But I find it to be quite heavy but perhaps tats a signal for quality, and the glasses are very tight gotta use some strenght to ply them open for fitting but perhaps tat signal for brand new. But I find the lens sitting on my cheeks when I put them on & it's obstructing my smile when I lifted those cheek, I'll try to readjust the nose pads & maybe it'll turn out better. Overall, it's value for money and I look gorgeous with these.."
4,Ray Ban 3044,"These sunglasses are truly small, I read all the reviews before I bought them and they said If you have a small face they'd be okay. Well I'm petite and have a small face but they were too small for my face. They'd be best described as a juvenile product."
4,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XPWKGO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title,I had my 1st order replaced for bigger size without any problems. It took them little longer than I would expect because it was in back order. Otherwise OK.
3,"Exactly What They Say, Small","These are real RayBans, brand new and small. I prefer the larger style but use they for running, or a different look depending on how my hair is. Great price to have an alternative pair of aviators."
3,Nice fit,"I like the fit and the color, but a bit small for my frame.. If you're small and petite this will look good on you.. but if you're 5'6"" like me, it will look a bit small.."
4,Good product. A comparation chart is needed,"The product is good. This are the traditional aviators but in a small size. This size (52 mm) are good for a child, bit too small for an adult."
3,It was really very good,"I was not really happy about the sun glasses, It was so small to my face. I made a mistake, I don't have the box on it except the ray ban box..so, if I can return it? Thank you very much."
3,a tiny one,"Well,it's much smaller than i thougt.I decide to give it to my 4-year-old son,that would be 5-6 years later."
5,Perfect Fit,Perfect fit for a small frame face like mine. I am super tiny 4 ft 10 in 20 years old and these glasses are HOT!!! Fast shipment.
1,no returns,I ordered these aviators from sunglass express and right when i opened them i knew they were to small. I emailed the company that day and they still haven't responded; its been over a month. so now im stuck with a pair of sunglasses that don't fit.
2,Bought for Female-- absurdly small,"Purchased this for my girlfriend, who is by no means has a large face/head... The 52mm frames were extremely tiny-- basically child's size... Would not recommend for anyone 12+ years old... (girlfriend wound up getting 58mm, which fit perfect and are the ""common"" size)"
5,Me likey!,"Though I have read all kinds of reviews online, I wanted to try it out for myself. It's just the perfect size for my small, angular facial shape. I don't wear it everyday because I like is so much I don't want to scratch it. It's a good thing, right?"
2,"Too Small, Yes Probably for kids","I have been using the same classic Gold/Green Ray Ban Aviators since 1984 (Before they were popular with the kids) because of the quality, durability and clarity of vision, so they are great glasses! I recently misplaced a pair and didn't want to spend the $129-139 they are now, Geez!! and went with the smaller glasses as i have gotten away from the 57/58mm large frame as they are too big on my face. I really wanted the 55mm which is what I believe I had and went with the ""small"" 52mm as an available alternative. These were indeed too small, because the earholders have to stretch on my face and I have a small to average face. So, while they do work for driving, beach etc. They really are too small. Like some other reviewers I took the chance, but they are more suited to a kid. My 16 year old son is going to get a great unexpected present if I can't easily exchange them. Hope this helps."
5,"Pequeños, pero muy buenos","Soy de cara mediana y estos lentes me quedan muy bien,, se debe tener mucho cuidado al comprar, porque son pequeños.. a mi me gustan los lentes pequeños.."
2,Itty Bitty,"I still love the style of these glasses, but I didn't realize how small they would be. I guess I didn't note the style name when I ordered them so I was surprised when I first put them on. Those with average faces or bigger would be better off ordering a bigger frame."
1,disappointed,I missed the statement in the thingy that said it was not full-size Aviators. Watch out yourself because it is too small for any adult face that I know of.
1,No fue lo que yo esperaba,"La verdad los lentes son muy chicos llastimosamente no hay forma de debolverlos el tema es que en el modelo no decia que era tan pequeño, quiero saber si hay forma de cambiarlos"
5,Rayban is hero of sunglasses.,"This product is very good because it is very lightweight when I wear this sunglass, so it makes me comfortable to wear it. This is the best one of product from Rayban."
3,unhappy,"The glasses looked great out of the box and I was jazzed, until I noticed a flaw. In the left hand corner on the inside of the lens an RB was etched into the glass, albeit a small etching, it draws my attention to it. Other than that everything else is great. I am returning today in an effort to exchange as I liked the case, the cleaning cloth and the glasses, but to etch someting that is distracting such as that is unacceptable..whats up with that anyway?I hope a request for an exchange will not create any issues...we'll see"
5,A Lady With A Voice!!!!!,"Wow! Nancy Wilson gives her songs many dimensions. That soulful voice can go to places that most of us only fantasize!""Do You Still Dream About Me"" is the opening song on the cd. This vocal is powerfully hypnotic! There is no song quite as satisfying as ""A Lady With A Song"". ""That's What I Remember"" features a searing vocal and a hot arrangement. ""Love Is What I Need"" is a funk-fest! It is a wild number. There is no love song quite like ""Melody Is You"". Nancy's sensitive style is absolutely delicious! The finale is a grand diva ballad known as ""Heaven's Hands"".This cd offers a wonderful variety of songs from one of the grandest female vocalists in America! The arrangements are all brilliantly orchestrated. Nancy fans, this is a must to add to your collection."
5,Nancy Never Dissappoints,"The opening song, ""Do You Still Dream About Me"" couldn't be more perfect as this is one of her best. I agree with the other posters on this one. Nancy has always meant class, quality of song selection and performance. I don't think Nancy can do any wrong....don't let the new artists get all of your money and invest in this CD for quality singing."
3,THE TECHNICALS,"Everything said, the technical quality of the DVD I purchased was not very good at all. Visually it has the quality of a much used VHS tape. As for its audio, you get no menu for it and what you get sounds like mono. Anyone else encounter this?"
2,Sleeping Beauty is average,This perfomance of Sleeping Beauty is not well done. The choreography is boring and the ballerinas are not precise and not elegant. One of the worst ballets I have seen on DVD. It is better to stick with the wonderful Russian ballet companies. Overall grade: C-
2,Your little song is sung away.,"This album starts off typically enough for a Jandek album. He sings seven songs while accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. Then the album takes a strange turn, even by Jandek standards. The last track is an instrumental featuring Jandek banging away at a piano for 15 minutes. An out-of-tune piano, for that matter. Which should come as no surprise, since his guitar is always out-of-tune. This is another difficult to listen to Jandek album, probably even more so than usual."
2,Rather one sided,"This is a pretty fair work, unfortunately somewhat tainted by the almost total concentration on the British experiences. Someone needs to tell Mr. Bull that other nations were also participants and also had to evolve their tactics and such. I was disappointed with this work."
2,Sound could be better,"One of the other reviews commented how this disc had no surface noise? Well, they're right. The noise reduction (sounds like an older analog process) removed enough of the upper frequencies that the label chose to add echo after the fact to cover up their handiwork. So, ""Blue River"" is a brilliant performance . . . but it appears here in mediocre sound. For my money, the best sounding set out there NOT on Mosaic is the 2-cd 'Jazz Tribune Vol 48' on RCA (a US release).There is a WORSE sounding Beiderbecke cd out there, with Orrin Keepnews' name on it yet. BUT . . . that's another story."
2,HORRIBLE DISCOEY ALBUM,"The video clip for the first song "" Change Your Mind "" is OK and it features Gary in Berserker's white and blue makeup.The rest of the songs are incredibly boring and Numan's vocals simply can't carry that kind of tunes.This is out and out 80's DISCO dull music !!Well,a friend copied this for me since it's out of print,luckily.And believe me,I'm no Numan detractor but a longlife fan who qowns EVERY record and video the master has put out.I reccomend you download the video,though."
3,it's ok,"I bought this book for my son who wanted to learn to sew. While it has some great patterns and comes with most of what you need, the directions can be a bit confusing to a beginner and there is an overuse of felt.The one project he has completed so far was the pull string purse. It is made from felt instead of regular material and was very difficult to sew. Also, the project used a straight stitch and this left holes in the purse around the seams when completed even though the directions were followed exactly. I will have to go back and sew that in myself.The measurements for the amount of floss to use to create the pull strings are off by several inches. Fortunately I helped him with that part and could see right away that there was no way the small amount of thread they called for would work.I think if they had used a different stitch and regular material, this project would have been much easier. Hopefully the other patterns will be easier to follow and complete."
4,great for a rainy day,"I bought this for my daughter because she wanted to learn to sew for her dolls, but I can't even sew a button. She is only six so I had to help her a lot, but it was a good learning experience for both of us. She made a pin cushion, needle holder and bag so far. She likes to stretch out the projects and so them on rainy, hang at home days."
1,Great Hands On Projects,"My 9yo daughter can do these projects unassisted and has achieved a great sense of accomplishment in doing so. Easy projects for beginner seamstress (hand sewing)w/ clear pictures and directions. PLUS all the raw materials (felt, fabric, ribbon, trims, needles and thread) that you need to complete the projects. A great b-day gift for this age, too. Highly recommended for girls (and boys?) who like quiet pastimes and working with their hands. --From a Mom."
1,Please Do not Waste Your Time and Money,This book is of zero educational value. You will not find it useful. Some scattered information without any reasonable relationship. It is a waste of time and money. I am not quite sure why they have decided to publish such a useless book. You cannot even use it as a reference.
2,Bob James meets Wyndham Hills?,"I was quite disappointed. It sounded like Wyndham Hills music, which I like in small doses. But I was expecting a funkier jazz sound."
2,"Dancing on the Water, Drowned",I anticipted a consistent work throughout the CD but found myself wondering if this was truly Bob James or an impersonator. The music was contrived and stilted. It did not flow as I had expected. ven Joe Sample didn't save the music.
2,Different than most of his releases,"This has nice background music while I work. I don't mean that in a sarcastic way. None of the songs made my personal playlists, meaning none of the songs really grabbed me. I have many of his CDs. This is different than his masterpiece releases, but on the other hand, I will tell you I'm sure there are people who will say this is their favorate. Truly great artists like Mr. James generate that kind of diverse opinion. If you are thinking about getting it, you either heard something on it that you like, or you are really into Bob James like I am and want to add to your collection. In the former case you should go ahead and get it. In the latter, you may be dissappointed but there is no way I can call this a bad release and I listen to it occasionally while I work."
2,Not what I expected!,I have several Bob James albums and all of the fourplays so I just knew I would enjoy this new CD. I was way off the mark here. Most of the music made me feel I needed to be in a tuxedo at Carngie Hall complaining to my wife about how the servants don't appreciate refined music. This whole album was not the Bob James I am used too. I guess that I like my jazz upbeat and something that I can tap my foot too while driving to work. Most of this was quite boring to me.
2,"great design, one major flaw","I am a huge fan of personal travel presses and use one every day. The mug works great and is very pretty, however the lack of a snap down lid prevents me from using it any where but at home. I purchased this one because I loved the idea of having the extra screen in the lid and the groovy colors available. I just didn't notice it when I ordered and trying to use it with out in the car led to a hot coffee stain."
4,More intense,"Clare begins to settle into her new home above the coffeehouse and even meets a great new guy.... but is he?This book begins to push the envelope in terms of being a ""cozy"" mystery. More intense than the first with more deaths and sadness. But still not overly graphic.I actually enjoyed the book being more intense, I'm a fan of both cozies and thrillers. The reason why I decided to knock this book down a star was because the editing seemed to be worse. If I had to see the word dessert be spelled desert one more time I was going to go crazy.I'm loving this new series and all the great coffee tips. I already downloaded and started to read the third book in the seriesLatte Trouble (Coffeehouse Mysteries, No. 3)"
4,Good book,"First off, my brother bought me the first book in the series on a hunch that I would enjoy the books. I am an avid reader and am always looking for a new ""the woman who does something else, but likes to solve mysteries on the side""series.This series is great- I personally like how at the first that you get a glimpse at what will happen through the killer's eyes. I like the coffee recipes at the end- and actually like learning a little about the process of picking coffee beans and stuff since the riskiest coffee I get is a caramel frappe from Starbucks.This book was fun, and I finished it in a day- loved it!Give the series a try- you won't be sorry!**** If I remember correctly from another site, the people who write this series are a husband and wife team- who also write a book about a library mystery series.***********"
4,good second book in a mystery series,"This is the second book in a mystery series, followingOn What Grounds (Coffeehouse Mysteries).Clare Cosi manages an historic coffeehouse in Greenwich Village in NYC. She is also the mother of a daughter who is studying cooking at a school on New York.When customers of the coffehouse start becoming the victims of a killer, and the one thing that seems to tie them together is the Manhattan dating scene, Clare starts hovering protectivly over her daughter, little thinking that she might find a wonderful partner herself.But that seemingly ideal partner is a suspect in hte killings.Can Clare (and her heart) survive the suspicians and strange happenings surrounding her new beau?Darker than the first book, the characters are also made deeper by that darkness."
4,Like the theme,"Ms. Coyle has written a thoroughly enjoyable mystery. I spend some time in coffee shops and while I was reading this story, I took a special interest in the cup before me. Characters are interesting and fun. I do think the first suspect should have been dear Clare since it was her coffee that was killing her customers."
4,"An easy, comfortable read",I learned so much about coffee and coffee making that I intend to start grinding my own and paying attention to how I brew.This author obviously pulls the reader into the story.
3,Keeps You Guessing,"I like this one even better than the first because it's a real Who-dunit. I thought I knew who the killer was, then second-guessed myself. I'll have to try marinating steak in coffee some time."
3,Needed a better proofreader,"I enjoyed the book and the one before it well enough but the poor editing bugged me. In the first book, we had people getting 'balled out' instead of 'bawled out' several times; in this one there were four or five uses of 'discrete' when the author meant to use 'discreet'. Add in a few other typos and I was starting to look for them, not read the book for itself.Really poor proofing/editing."
2,Definitely dark and a bit dull,"It is darker and drearier than the others in the series. The characters were all fairly flat in this one. The ""Death Row"" art gallery was absolutely vile. I prefer the lighter mysteries without the gory bits. I will keep reading the series hoping this was a one off thing."
4,More like a tripple expresso,In the second installment in the Coffeehouse Mystery series things are getting darker for our owner Clare Cosi. This time around frequent customers are dying off and is it personal or is someone just trying to get to Clare herself....You will have to read to find out. Definitely a lot darker than the first and even more character development. If you liked the first you will definitely want to see what happens in the this one. With such a fun and quick read you will be wanting to get your hands on the next installment Latte Trouble....
3,Not as good as the first...,"I really like Cleo Coyle's first Coffeehouse mystery, On What Grounds, so I had high expectations for the sequel. It started out extremely intriguing, with a creepy villain and Clare in her typical love-life mess.Unfortunately, only a few chapters into the book, I stumbled onto a passage where Coyle gave the whole thing away! I like being able to figure out the mystery, but not so clearly and not so early in the story.I haven't given up on the Village Blend. I'll be looking for the third in the series as soon as it comes out."
3,"Gimmicky, but good","As Gypsy Rose Lee said, ""You gotta have a gimmick."" Obviously coffee is the gimmick here: recipes, descriptions, details about different grinds -- where they come from, how they are prepared -- are sprinkled throughout this book like cinnamon on a latte. Frankly, I didn't like this aspect of the book -- or the frothy style, which includes more than a few typos and grammatical solecisms (such things drive me crazy).But the book's plot redeems it. In the venerable style of a true whodunnit, clues are inserted skillfully and fairly so that an attentive reader can figure out the puzzle, but the answer is not obvious. It's rare to find a mystery writer who can carry on so adeptly in the style of Agatha Christie.For someone who has spent a little (but not a lot of) time there, I also thought that Coyle did a good job of evoking the atmosphere of Manhattan, and incorporated details from the online dating scene in a way that effectively creates our moment in time and place."
1,Not Worth the TIME to Read...,"This was the worst mystery series I've ever read to this point. The only positive and enjoyable tidbit to savor of this series were the trivia and tips on coffee. The plot is predictable, characters are a bit typecast and stereotyped, and the author tends to be over the top in describing TOO MUCH information with the setting. Do I really need to know so much? Let the reader put the picture in their minds while reading a decent mystery plot. (By the way, the first 2 books have a very disappointing ending -- typical of a poorly written story.)"
4,"Well-written, Entertaining and Suspenseful","This is the second or third book I've read by Greg Iles. I wasn't crazy about the beginning, it was a bit slow but it picked up and held my interest. Story about a team of serial kidnappers and the reason why they chose a specific family. The character of the daughter is a bit unbelievable but once you get past that, it is an entertaining read."
5,Great read. Fast paced from start to end.,"Greg Iles does it again. This book has lots of action, keeping the reader entertained through every page. This will be enjoyed by all."
4,"Fast moving, well-written if a little implausible","I read this book very quickly--it has a sort of motor in it. In many ways it is well-written. My main problem with it is that it is a little over the top in terms of plausibility, especially the final part of the book. But I would still recommend this book.Note that the movie version (screenplay also written by Iles) came out this past weekend. I did not think the movie was as good as the book, and the movie has not been getting particularly good reviews...."
4,The Formula Works Well,"The writer is one of the most talented in the mystery genre and has the ability to take a story that has previously been written and can tweak it and update to the present time. This talent serves him well in this novel which centers around a successful Doctor, his wife and their five year old daughter. The issue involved is a kidnapping for ransom. The manner in which this is set up is fiendishly clever and makes this book a real page turner. There are numerous twists tht keep the reader guessing throughout this excellent read. The characters are extremely well developed and their depth grows as the syory progresses. Like an artist who utlizes canvas to convey a painting, Iles is able to add layer upon layer as he enriches each character. Although some of the scenario is rather far fetched, if the reader takes the book for what it is, they will be in for a most scintillating read."
4,Another great thriller from G.I.,"I am continually amazed, but Greg Iles is a great writer. This is another in the long line of excellent novels....."
2,24 hours,"I bought this book simply because Greg Iles wrote it. Wrong move! It lacks the complexity, and rich settings of his previous books, especially A Quiet Game. It seems like he has jumped on the bandwagon of so many financially successful authors - churn 'em out - never mind content. I'll give his next one a read - and then likely find a new author, Completely disappointing."
2,this is perhaps the weakest book that iles ever written,"this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho."
2,Read THE QUIET GAME by this author but NOT this one,"My greatest fear is that reading 24 Hours might turn people off to other books by Greg Iles- and that would be too bad because the author's best works are so much better than this rather bland little book - as quickly forgettable as it is a quick read. I nearly put it down several times but felt compelled to finish it, if only to give a fair review of the book. On the other hand, please, please pick up and read The Quiet Game by the same author. It has the heart and soul that 24 Hours lacks and you may well be amazed, as I was, that this book was written by the same author. Skillfully blending southern politics and scandal, a bit or romance and riveting action and suspense into one seamless tales, this is a book you'll truly enjoy. Plus, you can get it in paperback and save money compared to buying 24 Hours."
2,"Skillfully Crafted, yet flawed.","24 Hours is the type of book that you feel driven to finish reading in 24 hours. It is written with a fast paced driving energy that keeps you turning the pages. Those with children will find themselves identifying with the characters of this novel as they make decisions that may have devastating impact on those they love. 24 hours plays out like a well crafted movie. The reader can't help but wonder if this could be a handbook for those wishing to commit similar crimes. The kidnapping seems to only have risk should the criminal make a mistake. This is chilling to those that have children.As exciting and as thrilling as the book was, it is difficult to suggest. Some parts were described in too disturbing of detail. These unnecessarily detailed parts revolved around the attempted rape of the mother of the kidnapped child. Were it not for these sections, I would be more willing to suggest it to others."
2,An 'ok' book,"Greg Iles has set such a high standard with his previous books that '24 Hours' isn't worthy of his name. This book would be satisfactory to an average writer however. While this book is solid, it lacks the depth and richness of his other ones. My favorite ' Mortal Fear' is my #1 or #2 of all the books I've ever read... Sorry Greg, hope you tear up your new contract and get back to working for yourself (no deadlines or demands to meet). Your the best writer out there, let's prove it again. michael"
2,"Hi on suspense, low on everything else","I swore I wouldn't read cheap thrillers, but I'm running out of books (on tape) at my local library. Of course, the plot grabbed my attention right away, but writing is sparse, characterizations are weak, and the plot slightly formulaic. The graphic nature of some of the narrative was a definite turn off. I'd leave this one on the shelf."
2,24 Hours,"Obviously, I am in the minority as to the ""raves"" about this book. I have read three previous Iles novels and enjoyed them thoroughly.........they were suspenseful, well written and most enjoyable. Sorry to say, I cannot give a ""thumbs up"" to 24 Hours. While the general plot of the kidnapping is good, the characterizations are unbelievable and the dialogue goes from trite to mediocre. I was most relieved to at least finish it."
5,Gave Me the Chills,"How could I have missed this author? If the rest of his books are half as good as this one he'll goes on my ""A"" list."
3,Good But Not Great,"Greg Iles's latest book is good but not a great read. I enjoyed his earlier books, but in an effort to reach a wider audience, he has dumbed down the story and changed the subject matter to one with mass appeal-child kidnapping. My biggest reservation is that this subject is well worn territory, and the reader can easily perdict events as they unfold. The three antagonists are stock bad guys, and I can easily see the actors being cast in this made-for-tv story. Cheap thrills."
2,"Good idea, but...","This book sounded interesting from reading plot descriptions and reader reviews. I found the plot of the story to be interesting and the story was a good read, but there was a lot of gratuitous sex in the book that just didn't need to be there. I skimmed these parts and was disappointed that the author felt that these parts were really important to the plot. If you are offended by material such as this I would stay away from this book."
1,Worst Greg Iles book I've ever read!,This book was horrible from start to finish. I never once believed the characters. Their actions and words did not speak of truth at all. I read the entire book and the entire thing felt like wading through sludge.I normally like Greg Iles (The Quiet Game is one of my all-time favorite books) and it is hard for me to believe this was even written by the same guy.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who has a shred of understanding of the human psyche.
2,Blah,"This is Iles' worst book. I'm giving it two stars. If it were another author, I'd probably rate three stars.24 Hours reads like a simple chronology of events. There's a little character development, but not much. They are like cardboard cutouts compared to Iles' other works. On top of that, the dialogue isn't very interesting.Iles may have had an interesting idea with 24 Hours. Unfortunately I don't think it translated into a good novel. Instead, I'd recommend Deep Sleep or Iron Cross."
1,Very disappointing,"This book started with so much promise, but really let me down. I found it to be completely absurd in places, totally predictable in others. Some of the things that the head ""bad guy"" did were ridiculous. The ending was so ludicrous that it was all I could do to complete it.I haven't read any of his other works and, based on this one, I wouldn't read them."
2,I cheered for the ''Bad Guy'',"This book was atrocious. It hurt to finish it. I found myself completely unable to relate to Will, Karen or Abby. Did not like any of them as characters, found them unbelieviable and hence gravitated towards Joe Hickey. Again, skip this one. read something else, anything else. I will not read any more f Greg Iles. I like to learn while I read and this did nothing for me."
1,better title is 24 minutes,My review won't be helpful other than a personal opinion. Did not like this book. Can't tell you how it ends. Got bored and tossed it aside - in about 24 minutes.
3,This should come with a warning.......,".....Do not read just before going to bed. I did that the first night after starting this book and had a heck of a time getting to sleep. Not because of the story itself, but because the story is so frantic. I actually thought the story was a bit too predictible. Yes there were some unexpected twists and turns, but the conclusion was what I expected. No surprises. Just lots of action, lots of things going on at the same time at the 3 places the family was being held. This took away from the enjoyment of the book for me. The story didn't flow well. So, with that and the lack of real surprises, I must give this only 3 stars. Great effort, but it missed the mark for me. I would recommend Turning Angel or The Quiet Game instead of this one."
2,I expected better from such a good writer,"I've read other books by Greg Iles and have been impressed with them (I read The Footprints of God twice - loved it). This story, despite being a bit predictable was good. However, the ending, which in concept was a fine ending to the story, felt rushed in its telling, as if there was a publishing deadline that forced an abrupt and summarized ending. It ruined the whole reading experience. It doesn't mean that Greg is a bad author, not every book can be a home run, but I certainly can't recommend this book."
3,"Good, but not great","Good character development, but the last 50 pages are so unrealistic. Planes landing on highways in traffic? C'mon. That only happens in LA!"
4,I'd expect to see a film adaptation soon,"The story takes of like a fighter jet from an aircraft carrier and keeps ramping up up up to the end. You'll want to race through it like a delicious piece of candy. There's not much to it, but it sure is good. Perfect fare for Hollywood. I give it a solid four stars for entertainment."
5,Gripping Suspense Thriller,"This is one of the fastest reads you will ever have. I put the world aside for one day as I read through this taut story of three people who kidnap a little girl. The parents refuse to play the game of victim by the kidnappers rules and it might backfire. Iles writes suspense as well as anyone in the world. His meticulous research into kidnappers minds, strippers (did Greg get a write off for that?) and the field of medicine makes the read completely believable and intensely heart pounding. This book rates with Spandau Phoenix as one of Iles finest and ranks as one of the best suspense thrillers you and I will ever read.Kevin Hogan, ..."
4,24 Suspense Filled Hours,"The audio version of Greg Iles's 24 Hours is well read by Dick Hill. It is a suspense filled tale about the perfect kidnapping plan gone wrong. With three very different villians and three very different victims of the kidnapping plot, this book is filled with many twists and turns. The reader is never sure how the book might end or who might survive the night. I agree with other reviewers that the past section of the book is pretty amazing as the writer takes a great deal of liberty with reality in order to resolve the situation in which the characters find themselves. Still, a well written read with well-defined, interesting characters."
4,Fast pace page turner.,**** Greg Iles has become one of our favorite mystery writters. This book lives up to The Devil's Punchbowl in every way. He can take a typical plot and twist it like a pretzel.
4,A fun thrill ride,This book is very entertaining. The details are great and enjoyable to read. The action scenes fly by with tension. The only problems is some of it is way overboard. This makes the conflict resolution a little hard to accept.
3,Botched Kidnapping Tale,"Bent on revenge, Joe kidnaps the daughter of the doctor who couldn't save his mother. But Joe's scheme unravels when he discovers the girl will die without her insulin. An enjoyable, Grisham-style thriller."
2,Wait for the movie,"I bought this after seeing the preview for the movie version entitled ""Trapped"". I should have waited. An interesting premise degenerates into a beyond-belief soft-core-porn attempted rape and the story never recovers. Holes in the plot are big enough to land a plane in."
2,a disappointing experiment,"I have always enjoyed the books of Iles. They always combined adventuresome, yet believable stories with complex, human characters. Though 24 Hours is adventuresome, it lacks any of the complex characters to which I was accustomed in Mr. Iles' previous books. Instead the characters are stereotypical and general. The valiant mother fighting for her daughter's life. The mentally and physically abused young woman wanting to start a new life chapter. The dim-witted, oafish, yet good-hearted captor. The heinous bad guy who's just stupid enough to let his captive get the upper hand while his pants are around his ankles. These are all characters we've seen before. This book looks great in theory, but when I actually read it, I really felt as though I was cheated. This would probably make a great movie, but the book sure is lacking. Give us another Quiet Game or Black Cross!"
3,Interesting but......not so much so......,"This DVD gives a good ""synopsis"" of Bujones, but it is a bit too ""precious"" in its scenes of him walking in the surf and studying himself in the mirror. His dancing, while superb, does not measure up to the hype of the dialogue. His role in ""Giselle"" was a disappointment.......for true ballet critics, i suggest Roberto Bolle's rendition. This one left me somewhat let-down."
3,"Good Music, but more of the same melodically from Farrar","I like this album, but Farrar's new melodies for these old folk songs are all very similar. They all start to sound the same after a while. The instrumentals between tracks are nice and they are only about a minute each. It's good, but it's not exactly new territory for Farrar."
5,Printable Class 1 DVD-R Blanks,These are Class 1 (best) DVD blanks. The glossy finish makes a professional looking multicolor label using an inkjet printer with appropriate software. I have used several hundred of the less expensive matte printable Verbatim label and have never made a coaster. The glossies just make a little better looking label but they cost more.
1,JUNK,"These DVD-R's are pure junk. Probably why they are in a plain white wrapper. 80% failure rate. On the plus side, I now have a lot of coasters and frisbees. HP are a bit more expensive, but are well worth it, since I've never had to throw one away! Stay away from these ""brand name"" discs. I will only buy HP discs from now on. I learned from my mistake."
1,Amazon bad customer service,"No problem with the product, but order it instead from B&H or some place else. USPS states that Amazon shipped this product 'bound printed material' rate, first of all it doesn't qualify for that rate, is the very slowest the USPS offers. CS at Amazon said that it was because I choose to use their Super Saver shipping. Okay, it shows it shipped a week ago from a town 75 minutes away from me and I still didn't have it. Amazon, never again."
1,Printable DVD,Very! Very! disappointed.Here are the reasons:-this item is not available to Canadian customers. I had it delivered to a US address and then forwarded to me. This was an additional $40 cost.- the printable surface was not as large as I expected. (not to hub)- I will never order blank DVDs through Amazon again.
4,Pretty good,"This book has a great message and sheds light on the practice of medicine in different cultures and peoples' different perceptions of pain. The book gets a little redundant at times, which is why I only gave it four stars"
5,outstanding,"The Gift of Pain is one of my all time favorite books. I first read it years also and have reread it twice. I have loaned my original book to many friends, all of whom loved it. Even all of my kids have read it. Now I buy copies to give away. It is Dr. Brand's memoir and what an amazing life he had. With little fanfare or recognition outside his narrow field, he made great contributions to medicine as well as to his patients. He is certainly one of my heros."
5,A Journey not a read!,"If ever there was a book that deserves accolades, this is it. And yet no amount of superlatives could express just how wonderful this book is and what it does to you. It is not so much a book about pain as a book about life. It evokes a sense of gratitude for life that will stay with you for life. How fortunate it makes you feel when you read about both the misfortune and the courage of others. And how the true meaning of life becomes apparent. Without ever telling you what to think, Dr Brand makes you think. He makes you realise that life, with all its challenges, is the great gift. There were times when reading this book that I found myself so moved emotionally that I had to stop reading, almost as if I had to take a deep breath and contemplate what I had just read. And then, slowly, I'd pick the book up again and re-read that moving passage before continuing on. This book is a journey more than a read. It is a journey you will never forget. Please buy it."
5,Moving account,"This book is a moving account, part biographical, part medical that gives incredible insight into the experience of pain. Pain is protective and a subjective experience. Dr. Brand makes things imminently clear and understandable. Great read."
5,I bought 5 copies to share with others!,"A very inspiring true story that helps one gain perspective on many things, not the least of which is pain."

5,Book Nitty-Gritty,Huge brick of a book from Sundance: hardback released without dustjacket in a clear plastic cover. Pictorial boards. Sewn binding. 496 pp. 4.75 pounds.Illustrations on every page; 30% of them in color. 30 maps. Many bridge drawings.
5,Wonderful series on the RGS,This book (12 volumes) give the RGS enthusiast everything he/she needs to know about the RGS and its history. In addition I found the building plans very useful.
3,nice pictures but...,note how small the book actually is! I didn't realize it's basically pocketbook size--don't expect a regular sized colouring book.
3,A pocket full of fun,"Cute little coloring book that fits easily in your pocket. My question is, Where do you put all the crayons?"
4,A Nice Friendship/Partnership Story,"I would give this story 4 1/2 stars if I could because while this is not the best of the Granada series, it certainly isn't the worst. I like ""Silver Blaze"" because it is a good story (even if Doyle got some of the horse racing details wrong), and it is nice to see Holmes and Watson working together. Watson (played by the supurb Edward Hardwicke) is not the useless cardboard cutout which is only there to fill space, he assists Holmes with studying the evidence, and later hunting for the horse upon the moor. The scene where they are cheering on Silver Blaze in the race is grand, and the expression on Holmes' face is priceless. He wants to cheer for Silver Blaze but can't quite break that reserved barrier. Jeremy Brett plays the eccentric detective beautifully although he does look tired in this story."
3,The beginning of the end,"I am sorry to say that I cannot really recommend this video, and I wish they had filmed it before Jeremy Brett's illness started to affect his performance. For affect it it certainly does.Still, there is the marvellous line about the dog in the night-time..."
2,not that great...rambling John & annoying Yoko,"I've read lots of John Lennon interviews & I generally find him to be fascinating, controversial, and entertaining. This interview is not in the same vein. John is rambling, Yoko is self-congratulatory, and there are no revelations here.One interesting note: John briefly talks about his assistant Fred Seaman who went on to write a book about the last few years of Lennon's life. Yoko Ono went up against him in court after he admitted to taking some of Lennon's diaries supposedly being asked by John to pass them along to his son Julian.All in all, there are much more interesting and revelatory interviews with John Lennon than this last interview of his life."
4,Got the job done!,"I had a Water Cylinder Piston I needed to get apart. It's used for a large Steam Kettle. 1 of 2 that this one has. It has these 4 funky slotted internal Nuts with a threaded hole threw the middle. So not much on the sides to grab onto. This one was a little to large, but it was the only one I could get fast enough so I had to grind on each side to make it smaller and fit down into the holes those funky nuts fit into. It worked for me. It held up. It hasn't been apart for 12 years and is in a washdown enviroment in a food plant. I have since gotten a smaller Snap-On one, a GF22 for next time. I was using my Air Gun on this Armstrong Drag Link socket and it took a beating just fine."
5,Almost a Rolex,"I am actually very impressed by this watch. Let's start with one minor point: the second hand doesn't quite match the markers. Other than that, I am very impressed by this watch. It looks and feels like a Rolex or an Omega Seamaster, but costs about 1/10th of the cost. The look and feel are very good, and I am very impressed. I like the luminosity at night. This is a nice watch for the price."
5,14 pieces for guitar,This is one of the most enjoyable fingerstyle CDs that I have ever listened to. The first song LISBON is hypnotic as it welcomes you into the world of Reynold and his solo performance on a classical guitar. Each of the original songs give you an appreciation for the creative talent of Reynold Philipsek. When the music is over and the church bells ring I find myself wanting to listen again real soon. Thanks Reynold.
1,Two thumbs down!,"Don't waste your money. My DW snare sounds better without it.I thought it would enhance cross stick, but it sounded awful."
5,A call to the arts!!!,"This is the book for you if you feel called into the arts, work in the arts, and: (1) want some biblical and historical perspective, (2) want to impact secular culture, (3) wonder why there aren't more Christians impacting popular culture, and (4) struggle with how far to go with the gospel in secular arts. It takes no specific position on how agressive or overt to be in presenting the gospel. Rather, it gives you the wisdom to help determine where God wants you. But, it will inspire you. Absolutely incredible!"
5,Wisdom in need of a wider audience,"A couple of years ago I interviewed singer/composer/producer Charlie Peacock for an online magazine. He sent me a copy of this book, and since then I have read it through about five times. Turner's insight and vision for Christian artists of all disciplines is almost incomparable in the modern church. He backs up his assertions with any number of contextually accurate scriptural references, and provides more encouragement for the bored and searching artist than he does condemnation of the status quo in Christian-produced art (although there is plenty to condemn). I consider this book absolutely essential for every Christian musician, dancer, painter, poet or artist of any color. It will radically transform your vision for glorifying God if you take its message to heart."
3,"PLEASE NOTE from an honest "" REVIEWER""","Rafe Esquith teaches highly gifted students, a fact rarely mentioned by journalists and/or himself.UPDATE: No ""impugning"" going on here. Esquith's class consists of students who've been designated ""gifted.""Rafe- you do work hard. Now it's time to play fair."
2,"I Agree, Slightly Inspiring, Very Intimidating.","I'm a new teacher, about 3 months on the job, and after reading this book I would not recommend it to any beginning teacher. I bought the book thinking it might be a how-to guide coming from a teacher who has successfully taught shakespeare to fifth graders. Unfortunately what I got was a book with some practical advice but mostly criticism of teachers and the education establishment. It was very discouraging. Reading this book is like having someone tell you ""you're not good enough to be a teacher"" over and over again. The man is a fanatic. If you're a new teacher looking for inspiration, don't read this. Read ""Tools for Teaching"" by Fred Jones or ""The First Days of School"" by Harry Wong. These books will actually give you practical advice on how to be a successful teacher, instead of intimidating you into thinking you should have never got that teaching degree in the first place."
4,There are No Shortcuts,"Excellent for Elementary Educators. Some application to Middle and High School. Inspires all teachers to reach for the best performance.Funny at times, but grounded in reality. Somewhat political at the end. Small disappointment."
2,"Vindictive, Petty Gossip","Although one must admire Rafe Esquith's creativity, energy and dedication to his classroom, unfortunately after reading his book it his pettiness and vindictiveness that stick in one's mind. I have to ask why his editors allowed him to include so many vengeful stories of not only fellow teachers and administrators but also even of former students who apparently didn't give Mr. Esquith the thanks he felt his due. Some of these stories may have been appropriate to include in his book, but many were not. One has the impression he must have worn down his editors into letting him include so many such anecdotes. Too bad no one asked Mr. Esquith to consider if his hero Atticus would have written such a book or why someone should pay money to read this kind of gossip."
2,Not quite what I expected . . .,"I really wanted to like this book. I picked it up on the book store after scanning some of the passages and finding them inspiring. And I did find some of the story inspiring. But, the more I read, the more I got a negative sense about this guy. He doesn't seem to understand boundaries. It's subtle at first, with his students calling him ""Rafe."" Then it becomes so obvious with all the examples about the student confusion. Students at this age need to know where the boundaries of parents, teachers, coaches, etc. are, so they can feel comfortable where they are and safe pushing those boundaries and developing into healthy adults whether it be academically, personally or both. ""Rafe"" never seemed to learn this, even after his experience with the ""Musketeers."" I found myself wanting to tell him to go to therapy instead of looking to Atticus to help him solve his problems."
5,Great book--In Spite of What Some May Say...,"This book is an excellent read! I read Mr. Esquith's book in one weekend and, despite what others have said here, I found it to be very true to life and inspirational. Try walking through some of the urban schools for awhile, you will see what he means. I have had close relatives leave school positions after 25+ years in education because of some of the very things Mr. Esquith discusses in this book. I have had contact with the most inane administrators and teachers...He isn't full of himself. What's wrong with helping children in your care to the best of your ability? He doesn't hold a grudge. He's telling it like it is, and I am so happy that finally someone has had the guts to talk about what it's really like dealing with the public schools. If we only had more teachers like him, public education would be in much better shape. This book should be mandatory reading for all teachers!!"
3,"Inspiring book, but a little self-obsessed","I picked up ""There Are No Shortcuts"" after hearing about Mr. Esquith's teaching style on NPR. Though he is to be commended for his efforts, in the book, he wastes no opportunity to remind us of just how much he has sacrificed for his students and plays the martyr role a little too heavily.Having said that, his writing style makes for an easy read and his accomplishments cannot be denied. It was inspiring to read about how he built up a strong educational foundation for students from less privileged backgrounds and opened their minds to Shakespeare as well as inspired them to reach for higher goals. But a little more self-effacement and acknowledgement of others would have been a nice touch."
2,"Wonderful work, but...","I admire the author. He has an intense dedication to his students. However, having read the book during my second year of teaching, I can tell you that a teacher should not have to sacrifice his/her life to be successful. I hope other teachers of low income children do not feel guilty that their eleven hour days do not stack up to the insane number of hours this teacher spends on his children."
2,Good read but...,"I read Rafe's book Teach Like Your Hair's on Fire first and thought this book would be different, being how it was his first...basically he talked about the same things/situations in both books. I loved Teach Like Your Hair's on Fire and was looking for something different but found that it was pretty much identical to the other. Still good information though..."
1,Not what I thought it would be...,"I received a good report on this book from some educator friends of mine, but upon reading this book, I found that the author was incredibly full of himself. He was all about the great job he had done, and not so concerned about his students. I just really didn't end up caring about the book by the end, I just had to finish it for a class instead."
2,Just OK,"This book was very self-serving. While he does take time to point out his pitfalls, most of the book is spent reviewing what he did right. Unfortunately he offers little method advice, I was never told why his reading program is the best or why his students score higher than any other students in the school. There is also excessive discussion concerning the troubles he had with administration and fellow teachers. This discussion is very sarcastic and doesn't often offer usable solutions, only problems he faced and overcame. While the title and the theory behind it hold true, there is little practical information in this book."
1,Disappointed and kinda irritated,"As an educator, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I looked forward to reading about ways to open the minds of students. Sadly, that's not what this book offers.What I got from it was ""if you're not willing to sacrifice ALL of your spare time and money and put your family behind your career, then you are not going to succeed as a teacher."" The author preached on and on about how he was so willing to make these sacrifices... It really seemed like he was stroking his own ego with this book.Do yourselves a favor and don't read this. LouAnne Johnson's books did way more for me than this one."
5,An inspiration to all of us who dare to teach.,"I truly enjoyed Mr. Esquith's book. As a teacher myself, I am inspired by his devotion and philosophy on nurturing our future generation. The book portrays anecdotes of frustrations experienced by many great teachers. This book is the advocate of those who dare to go above and beyond the call of duty in the classroom. Bravo Mr. Esquith! Continue your extraordinary work!"
5,First rate,"The innovator of real education that is successful. Stop all professional training that for the most part never work and just add to the pocketbooks of the trainers, and start using Rafe's approach and you will see the education of our children explode to height that we thought was impossible."
5,"If we had more teachers like Rafe, America's woes would be cut in half.","As far as great books are concerned this in not the one that will take your breath away; however, the content, the message, the passion is real. A quaint depiction of the true system of education is disappointing, and not simply because I have read this book but because I am a product of it. I have lived it. As an immigrant to this great country I have accomplished what I never imagined, a college education. Looking back I realized that I was always handicapped, that I could have been great, but the realities of a community consumed by mediocrity and content with surviving was the crutch that impeded my every step. We owe it not only to our sons and daughters, but our neighbors near and far. We are all in it together. Our children deserve the best education we can give them."
2,Almost threw it out!,"As a teacher, I was so angry and insulted reading the beginning of the book that I almost put it in the garbage. Recycle or book donation might mean someone else would be subjected to it, so garbage or burning seemed the only option. I was on jury duty and had nothing else to read, so I read it. It was an interesting and quick read and I did find some inspiration in it, but I found the insult to so many of the teaching profession and public education appalling. There are some bad teachers and bad things about public education, but Rafe would have you believe that he is one of the only good ones out there. It's too bad that I almost threw the book away to miss out on the inspiration that was buried within."
1,There is a fine line between genius and insanity...,"... and I'm quite positive that Rafe Esquith stands firmly on the ""insanity"" side. This was an interesting read, though I would never use it as a guideline for how to teach, which is how it was presented to me. More of a how not to, or a jumping off point for thinking about the demands of education today."
2,The distortion issue,"I still like the book, but new teachers should be careful when reading it. Several people have written that Esquith has left out some important details. For instance, what kind of population is this really? There are no African-Americans on the cover, or I don't know if they are even directly mentioned in the book. I don't believe race has any direct bearing on how well a student will do, but a white male compared to a black female teaching African-Americans in a ""jungle"" will have quite a different experience than a white male like Rafe teaching immigrants or Americans of immigrant families. Also, are most of these students from single-parent households? And when immigrants come to the U.S., don't many of them already have somewhat of a work ethic instilled in them due to their history and culture?Otherwise, I think it is a good book and I enjoyed it very much."
1,Method to Madness?,"Maybe that should've been the book's title. If you are insane enough to work at school from dawn to dusk, giving up your recess and lunch, then this book could be your guide. As for the rest of us normal teachers, the book is not very useful. This book portrays the life of a dysfunctional man, who teaches mostly gifted students, some of whom go to top colleges. Where are the statistics on those who didn't make it to the top? Where are the anecdotes about how to deal with every day classroom management issues?"
4,CMAC: deja vous,"Since I served in CMAC in 1969-70, I found Mr. Finnegan's book to be especially informative and amuzing. Eerily, some of my experiences mirrored those of his protagonist. Mr. Finnegan has an excellent eye for detail and a wonderfully wry sense of humor,which he puts to good use telling the story of a ""Saigon Warrior's"" trevails in Viet Nam. I believe both veterans and non-veterans would enjoy this book."
5,Horton crossbow string,"good item but a little tight, exactly what i wanted, and will buy again. darn is not two wenty words"
4,"Good string, no issues installing or using.",Have really no complaints about the product. Seems to be made of high quality materials. Installation is easy but requires some strength. Depending on your x-bow will determine how difficult it is to draw.
2,"""Gone to be an Orb""","""Gone to be an Angel"" is a popular epitaph, but if the IGHS (International Ghost Hunters Society) has its way, it won't be long before we walk through a cemetery and see a marker bearing the inscription, ""Gone to be an Orb""! I would have liked Ms. Ramsland's book a lot more had she not devoted so much of it to the IGHS and its ridiculous theory that ""orbs"" (reflections of light off minute particles directly in front of the lens and flash of cheap digital cameras) are spirits of the dead. (Quite frankly, I cannot think of anything less appealing than dying and becoming an orb!) The book contains 300 pages and on page 296, the author finally gets around to interviewing a reputable ghost hunter who cast some doubt on the ""orb"" theory, but she devoted only a single paragraph--and a short one at that--to his opinions. I expected something more objective from Ms. Ramsland. This book was a great disappointment."
3,This could spook you,"I do love the occasional ghost story and the writer's story of her investigations into hauntings and trying to get to the bottom of a 'haunted' ring were interesting. She spends a lot of time trying to contact its spiritual owner, taping 'interviews' that result in creepy sounds (screaming, wanting her dead, etc.). It gave me a bit of a scare, made me wonder if there is anything 'out there' (but I'm still doubtful), but some people who are of a more skeptical bent will probably throw this off as bull. Those who tend to believe more in ghosts and the supernatural world will be freaked out. You decide."
1,Don't buy it,"The author leaves the reader hanging with no resolution. She retold some old ghost stories and blah blah blahed about equipment. Kept building interest in a story she never follows through with. Traveled all around the country with money she got from a sucker like me.I think she took a page from the lame author Anne Rice - come up with a teaser idea, then try and write idiotic sequel after sequel to enrich yourself personally.As an author, if you don't have a fully fleshed out story that resolves itself at the end, then please don't waste a readers time. There are too many good books in the world. Buy a Stephen King novel instead. Far more original and satisfying scary stories."
3,Only one problem...,"This book was, on the whole, more gripping and interesting than I expected. But I had one major problem with it which plagued me throughout:Wraith tells her that he and Christian murdered multiple people. Yet Ramsland never seems to consider, oh, calling the police and getting that maniac off the streets. She obsesses over contacting Christian (the murderer's) spirit, but evidences no concern for the spirits of the people the two of them tortured and killed. She believe the story enough to be scared of Wraith.. but evidently not enough to have the police check it out, see if people had gone missing that might have been their victims. In the end, Wraith is still walking around free to do more violence.If she is having trouble sleeping, it might be her conscience..."
1,"Interesting, far-fetched and dissapointing","I will admit that this book was hard to put down, but this was only due to the fact that i wanted some answers that i unfortunately never got. The book keeps you on your toes with far-fetched ghost tales and interviews with the dead, but then drags you along with numerous history lessons that are used for page fillers. Although there are some very interesting happenings during her story, its like the author is very repetitive in what she is saying, feeding the reader the same stories, only telling them using different words. If i would have known how the book ended i would have never read it."
5,Daring!,"The best investigative book on ghost hunting out there, even though she doesn't fully buy into many of the claims made by others."
3,Not too Bad but.....,"Keep in mind that this book was published in 2001 so don't laugh too hard when when the author is fascinated when she is introduced to digital cameras for the first time! I am going to ""assume"" that if you are interested in this book you already know some things about the paranormal/ghosts so some of this book will be a little boring.With that said, the author does have a story that she is following which is why she travels around to meet psychics, ghost hunters, etc... and that part is interesting. You hope that at the end you can find out the big 'secret'. I will tell you that you don't and the climax at the end is more Hollywood and she ends it cold with no further explanation.She does keep an open mind to most things and is unbiased. In the end, I do agree with her that many 'ghost hunters' think their way is the only way and I saw the ones in her book as obnoxious. It's not a bad book and a quick read but the ending the a let-down."
1,"No, Travis walked away with the name AND the talent.","What can I say? I liked the first DOTN record, but LOVED the 2nd. Travis Meeks is an amazing songwriter and innovative musician. The 2nd album showed a diverse plate of influences, and broke him completely free of all the ""AIC Ripoff"" characteristics.So, the three former members of DOTN, formed Tantric, and strangely wanted to be characterized as an ""AIC Ripoff"". They strive to sound like them in hopes of success. They even used the same producer. So far, their plan is working, but it won't be long until they slip back through the cracks to obscurity.As for the new singer, Hugo lacks the raw essence of what a singer should be. The singing sounds forced and mechanical. The guitar parts are nothing more than rehashed solos that Todd stole from Travis.Besides, why settle for second-rate bland rock, when a new DOTN cd is coming out in a month or two?"
1,Weakness,"This album is pathetic. I had heard that these dudes totally rocked even without Travis Meeks . . . WRONG! No originality, sounds more like a ""pop-rock-play-by-numbers"" for an otherwise generic band. Glad I bought mine used."
2,Perfect for naptime,"I realize that Tantric came from three dumped members of Days of the New. You would think that perhaps, the guys might want to try something new. They didn't. It's the same old stuff that didn't work in DoTN, and it doesn't work too well here either.There is fine stuff on here, such as the catchy and emotionally charged first single, ""Breakdown,"" as well as the melodic and well-played ""Live Your Life,"" and ""Hate Me."" After a while, though, you'll notice while listening to the rest of the album that a: most of the rest of the album is boring or b: most of the rest of the album is entirely too repetitive. Extra points if you can tell easily the difference between ""Revillusion"" and ""Astounded.""With any luck, these guys will at least try some creativity next time, but I don't see it happening. Until then, consider this your next naptime need."
4,"Unimaginative lyrics, but strong sound","As the subj line reads, the album has an overall strong 'warm and fuzzy' sound, somewhat heartland-rockish. It definitely sounds influenced by early Creed.On the downside, the lyrics are rather uninspiring (but catchy and radio-songish).Nevertheless, most stores have it priced around 10 bucks, and at that price its a very good buy. At normal price, maybe you should wait until you have nothing else to buy and are really in the mood for a new CD.Dont get me wrong, its some of the best new rock out there right now, but I would recommend SOIL or Stereomud instead."
3,Foul language,"This CD is musically very good but, I had no idea of the language that would be used. It does not have anything on the label about foul language and I think that Amazon should do a better job of finding this stuff out."
2,Not that great,"I bought this CD when it first came out because I became a fan after seeing them live with Creed. Sorry, but this CD isn't that great. Pretty sloppy arrangements and just not a whole lot you can really sit and listen to. I probably listened to it for a month or so after purchasing it to see if it would grow on me. Haven't listened to it since. Hopefully the newest one is better."
5,AMAZING,"This is an amazing band. I just love the lead singer's voice--he has a very unique sound. I liked nearly every single song, which floored me! Great job, guys!"
2,More motivational than those guidance-counselor posters...,"The instrumentals were good... that's about it. Lyrically, ""Tantric"" is cheesy and whiney. I bought this CD off a friend who bought it the day before and was equally unimpressed, wishfully hoping it would be decent. I only reccomend this CD to people in need of corny-comfort from feeling unhappy. Otherwise, this is mainstreamized, non-contraversial ""metal"". Don't buy this if you're over 12 years old."
3,"Well, Strangely","Ya know Days Of The New? Probably. Now that all the members are now in Tantric except lead vocalist Travis Meeks, DOTN is a one-man band. And what's so funny is that Tantric sounds like DOTN and DOTN sounds nothing like DOTN.This new lead singer, like on Stabbing Westward's new self-titled album, doesn't really vary his voice very much but it doesn't get to the irritating point. Melodic songs like ""Hate Me"" make this song pretty good, though if you didn't think Angus (of ACDC)'s voice was annoying, then this probably isn't. It is active rock put in with a new singer with an extremely deep voice, and the best thing about Tantric is that it is all put together, rather than individual, but I thought that was neat when DOTN did that.Since I can't describe this that well, and the songs are somewhat forgetable (sorry), this album is mainly pretty good. ANd if you like active rock without the screaming, try this."
2,They need Meeks!,"I am a huge DOTN fan, as a matter of fact they are my favorite band, but without Travis it just doesn't work. The reason Travis fired the band was because they weren't taking the music seriously. The new singer is very good, I love his voice but the only thing they are doing is trying to copy the old sound, not too original. With Travis as the lead the soud was pure emotion just listen to dotn2 and you can hear that. I'm not saying that the cd is not good, it is but I do not agree with the bands choice of getting a singer that sounds so much like travis, the need something new and stop copying DOTN."
2,Days Of The Old.,"You know the whole story about how the members of this outfit are ex- members of Days of The New (minus the singer), and the musical resembelence is almost exact. Just picture DOTN with some distorted guitars, with an even more comical lyane stanley impression. Yes breakdown and about 3 other songs are interesting only if played once a month. Otherwise this is just another stereotypical ""post-grunge"" act. Dan."
3,I expected much more from this.,"When I first heard about this cd I was pretty excited because I'm a huge Days of the New fan (Tantric consists of former DOTN members). I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed. The instrumentals are pretty good. The first song and the second to last song begin with riffs that effortlessly seem to mimic each other. My biggest complaint is about the singer. He sounds like a cross between Danzig and Scott from Creed, except with a more nasal sound. The guitarist who sings sounds somewhat like Layne Staley from Alice In Chains, so I think that he should have done the singing. They could have picked up someone much better. So try to listen to as much of this cd as you can before you buy it. It's not on the same playing field as the debut from DOTN. I guess that Travis Meeks was the true musical genious afterall..."
1,"If you like rip-offs, buy this CD",Tantric is nothing but a bunch of whiny junk. They owe their existence to Travis Meeks (leader of Days of the New... the only band that's doing anything truly musical besides Dave Matthews Band) no matter what anyone else says. They copied Meeks' sound and made people believe it was their own. They even tried to get a singer whose voice sounds like Travis.Every song sounds exactly the same.Sorry ex-members of Days of the New... your band Tantric just doesnt cut it.
3,"A good record, but certainly not great...","I bought the CD after hearing about the former DOTN band members doing their own thing. After being a huge DOTN fan I figured it'd be worth checking out - but...the band/new singer don't stray very far from the first DOTN release. The first three songs are really good, but then the songs just sort of blend together and sound very much a like, and very much like DOTN. It's hard for bands to reinvent themselves, but you have to do something to separate yourselves from previous efforts otherwise listeners get bored easily.Not a bad disc, but after reading people say it's the best CD they've bought in years??? Come on...what else are you folks buying, because you aren't spending your money on the right discs!"
3,Foul language,"This CD is musically very good but, I had no idea of the language that would be used. It does not have anything on the label about foul language."
5,tantric,"awesome album... among the best new bands i've heard in a long while...up there with godsmack (they've been around a little while) Tantric is very cool...Breakdown really rocks, not to mention the whole cd.keep rockin u guys!!!!! p.s.i would love to see u live!!! bexplorer2296 ***"
3,Spare some change?,"Upon hearing that this band was composed of ex-members of Days of the New, I did not hesitate to pick up a copy the moment I saw one at the local music store. I was impressed by the first track, pleased by the second track.. but by the fourth track I was cringing every time I heard the word ""change"", which was quite often.The musicianship of the band is rather strong, and the dude can sing (rather a bit like Travis Meeks, sad to say). Like Travis Meeks, sometimes what they choose to say comes off as saccharine and less than inspired.It honestly took me a while to decide that the band's ceaseless harping about change wasn't some sort of ironic jibe at DoTN. In fact, the jury is still out on that one. I just know that this album will.. uhm, change your opinion of the word ""change"" forever, and may inspire you to change the cd as well."
3,some songs deserve four stars but the rest...,"...Are slow and not worth listening to. Songs like Paranoid, I Don't Care, Astounnded, and Breakdown are good fast rock songs that you must listen to. But other songs are too slow and you will find not worth your time. Tantric is a new style, acoustic rock and all. But that might get in your way if you are a heavy rock fan."
3,What did you expect?,"Well, Days of the New sounds like Alice in Chains. And guess what? So does this! What did you expect? If that doesn't bother you buy this (it sure beats Godsmack) but be sure to get all the Alice in Chains albums first, and Mad Season's ""Above"" too."
4,"Great CD, worth buying","Tantric's excellent mix of acoustic and electric guitar with the combination of hugo ferreira's excellent vocals, this cd is a winner. excellent backup vocals also line songs like ""I'll Stay Here"" and ""Astounded."" My personal faves are ""Breakdown"", ""Mourning"", ""Astounded"", and ""Frequency."" All the songs are worth listening to though."
3,listen up,"this is a great album, but listen up, not as good as days of the new! travis meeks is genius( that is why he has the name and tantric does not!!!!!!!!!!!Buy days of the new 1, 2, and 3 before any tantric, but get this too."
4,great album,"I don't understand when people that don't like good old rock music claim that rock is dead. if you like tool and system of a down thats great. I do too but i would consider them a slightly different genre. Obviously creed and tantric is more for the main stream music fans. i wish some people would just get over it and not bag on someone just cause they don't like the music. If thats the case why dont' you head over to the country section on amazon and bag on all of the hick music. If you truly don't like it explain why at least. I think tantric has some great songs and yes....some of them are a little repetitive and get TOO much airplay. You do have control over your stereo thought? right? Anyways...great job and i can't wait to hear the second album....I am also looking forward to hearing the new ""days of the new"" album....i've already heard a couple songspeace"
5,I Did not Regret Reading This Book,"This is a great read that explains how our minds work to protect us from ourselves, in a sense. If only(regrets)turn out to be helpful, in almost all instances, to help us either take constructive action or to reframe what we can not change. This is something that our minds does automatically after an action or inaction, and is the way that it immunizes us against always feeling bad about our sins of ommission or commission (though the feeling lasts a lot longer for the former). It's encouraging that we not only do this automatically, but that awareness of the process allows us to be alert to some opportunities in specific types of situations and to make better decisions. My only criticism is that an illustration or table may have been helpful in reinforcing the difference and the impact of a downward counterfactual vs. an upward counterfactual."
2,Can't make myself finish this book.,"I don't understand the wonderful reviews. I wanted to give up after the first chapter, but made myself continue to read because of the rave reviews here. Now halfway through, I have no desire to continue.I lost my own mother when I was 21 years old. This mother's whining about her mother lost five years ago is just annoying. Get over it. At least she had her for that long, she should be thankful.And she has taken up smoking again? Why? So her boys can see her die from lung cancer, like I had to watch my mother die from. Then maybe they too can write whiny books about their boring lives."
2,Summary fooled me into thinking this was about the loss of a mother...,"When I lost my mother in 2007, someone suggested this book to me. I thought I'd give it a try and as it started out great it quickly turned out to be a great disappointment. I quit reading about halfway through as I didnt really find it to be what I was looking for. Although I'm sure its a decent book, its just not what I was hoping for or even the kind of book that I enjoy reading."
2,Took me awhile to read but I liked it,"I'm not raving about this story. It took me awhile to get through and I used it as a lunch time book, but I did enjoy it enough to suggest it to my friends. I think if you've lost your Mom (talking to women here) and are having a hard time dealilng with the loss...this book may make you feel a bit better. You can read it or leave it..."
1,I wish I had my money back...,"I purchased this book to help me build an Internet affiliate marketing business. I have to say this book provide ZERO information regarding Internet affiliate marketing. The book seems to be a large book of affiliate links for Mr. Hancock. It also seems like a sounding off point for Mr. Hancock to toot his own horn. Your money is better spent elswhere, especially for the 12.99 price."
1,this book sucks,"To many crocheters, this book isn't worth paying for. While there are a few patterns I will try out, this book won't be a favorite. Too many of the pictures of the finished product are obscured by bein overly drapped, or are lost in the picture. The kittens are really cute, but I prefer to get a good look at the finished spread. I do like the back section with the dollies, they are for the most part viewable."
4,The kid can play,Eric was great on his first effort but he is just going to keep getting better as shown on this recording.
2,Love the voice. This CD? Not so much.,"I love Vern Gosdin's voice. I got this CD, but it was disappointing. It has all of his classics, but they are newly recorded, so they don't sound the same. Just stick with Very Best of the Voice and you'll be satisfied."
4,Exactly what I had hped it would be,The book arrived in good time and in good condition. M. Gass bok is always a pleasure to read. I still wonder how to get ahold of volume 1.
1,Worthless,"I've used several different tape-driven language programs before, but never one worse than this. The audio track sounds like it was recorded underwater, but even Jacques Cousteau couldn't understand this. Avoid like the plague."
2,So So,I think the songwriters of these songs are spectacular... but I think her voice sounds too much as if she is crying all the time.. it gets annoying after two or three songs. I have seen Casandra perform in Fiesta Broadway about 2 or 3 years ago and let me tell you that her voice does not sound like it did on this CD.. she was constantly going off key... I guess she's just another singer that gets her voice fixed by the engineers... Would not really recommend you spend your money on this CD... wait until someone else records them ... maybe someone like Nydia Rojas or Aida Cuevas.. now THEY can sing!!!!
2,The video is a bit outdated,The video is a bit outdated but it easy to follow and it works. It a bit slow for my tastes.
4,Not quite what I expected,I was thinking that these were going to be new updated DVD's but they were just the old VHS's put onto a DVD. The picture quality is not excellent but these were always good workouts and still are. I can get past the old pictures.
2,Feels Like We're Getting Leftovers...,"I have to agree with another reviewer who said that this collection seemed like a lazy way for Barbra (and her record company) to earn a few bucks. This collection is very uneven stylistically, and is therefore somewhat difficult to listen to. The two new songs, particularly ""We're Not Makin' Love Anymore,"" were only so-so and not among her best. Then we get the rehashed recordings of ""Memory"" and ""Comin' In And Out of Your Life,"" which are fine songs on their own, but were already included on ""Memories,"" a previous ""greatest hits and a few other songs"" set! The song ""By The Way"" stinks, in my opinion. Why not ""Kiss Me In The Rain"" instead? Even ""Left In The Dark"" would have been better. Only 4 genuine Top 10 hits on the whole album, and three of them are from ONE album (""Guilty""). I enjoy Barbra's artistry, but not so much her marketing."
1,Put Your Shirt On Barbra,"A weird collection of things that are on other hits albums. No value for the money, not even at a tenth of the price of one of her concerts."
2,ERROR IN YOUR SAMPLE RECORDING,"NOT SURE HOW IT HAPPENED BUT YOU HAVE BILLY JOEL SINGING IN BARB'S SPOTLLIGHT. WHEN I TRY TO LISTEN TO IT, ALL I GET IS BILLY JOEL."
2,Barbra Streisand Collection :greatest hits & more,I was disappointed in this album. Her selection of hits seems to be a little off. Her singing is good butnot her best.
4,Great Bargain,"Only the inside of the jewel box was damaged. Absolutely nothing wrong with the CD. Great music! Great memories! And what a bargain: ONE CENT, plus shipping."
4,It ought to be a law against being this funny,"I picked up this book for a light quick read and I must have laughed for hours trying to read this book. Actually, I started it in a bookstore and while waiting in line, I began laughing out loud. Finished it sitting on the porch laughing, my neighbors must think I am crazy, I was only reading the crazy man book."
5,need more sinbad,hopefully you can get more sinbad books his videos are great but they need more books for those who can't watch the videos love comedy books that really make you feel like you can hear them talk
5,Laugh a minute along with lessons in life. Awesome!,"This is just great humor and great insight from an awesome comedian. He most certainly delivers the hilarity, but there are a few somber times in the book where he is real, very real and takes a serious approach. He speaks highly of his dad, which I respect for 2 reasons. For one, if you have an awesome dad, like I do, and Sinbad does, you should express it. The second reason is because like myself, his dad is a preacher, and wanted nothing but the best for his boy.I guess I would suggest to read the book, not buy it on audio, because the person doing that might expect a stand-up comedy performance, and that isn't what this is about. With that said, however, it is very funny most of the time with the Sinbad humor that people all across the country have grown to love! If you love Sinbad, you'll love reading his book. He also teaches us lessons throughout the book about not taking ourselves too seriously. Have some fun while reading this book!"
4,Hilarious!,"I knew Sinbad was funny and I had seen his acts, some of those are included in the book. But as I was reading his book, there were times I just couldn't stop from laughing. My husband would want to know what was so funny, I tried reading it but it wouldnt come out cause I would just keep on laughing. I love this book. I was imagining the way he would say them which made it all the more hilarious. Buy the book!"
4,Just Like Sinbad!,He covers everything in this book. I especially love when he talks about him in the emergency room with his daughter with raisins up her nose. It's not a masterpiece book that is very well put together but he make up with it with all the funny stuff. It's just like he right beside you talking to you.
3,average,it is supposed to be an experience about a young journalist in macedonia.typical american one chapter he calls them macedonian and next chapter somehow he refers them to bulgarians.
2,Not enough info,"The book is well written, but if you purchase this book for getting to know more stuff about Macedonia and that period is not anything special, the ending is pointless and there is no total point of the books except explaning how life was then.Also he mixed the terms Bulgarian, Bulgar and Macedonian. In one place he says the people spoke on pure Bulgarian, on other that they spoke on pure Macedonian dialect.Also he is ""hanging out"" with some of the Bulgarian and the Macedonian komitajis so he is confued during the whole time why they are fighting eachother."
3,"Works well, but my cat hates the taste of it","I purchased this product for one of my cats that has a delicate stomach and vomits frequently. There was a noticeable improvement after the third day and she had a good amount of energy and had her appetite back.Now I give it to her on an as needed basis and am a bit reluctant to do so, mostly because she absolutely hates the stuff and she'll run from me if she sees me with a syringe.I'd like to give it a better rating, but the Gastralox has such an awful taste that it's difficult to give my cat the necessary dosage."
3,Might work if cat would take it,"This has a very strong (fishy?) smell which offends the two cats I tried to give it to. I'm pretty good with giving medication to my mellow animals, but when I did get some of this into one cat, he ran off. The other took one sniff and didn't hang around for more. Whether it's effective remains to be seen. If I could get it into the one with the stomach issues, I'd have a better idea. I might just try slippery elm on its own."
5,Courthouse Records,"This book gives a lot of great information and tips for research at court houses. It is up to date and thorough, and a great help to researchers."
3,Not my favorite,This workout is excellent. The majority of it is cardio without the stability ball. I would have liked to see more use of the Stability Ball. I prefer the Total Body Blast workout.
2,a little disappointed,I didn't know what to expect from this video but bought it on the recommendation of a friend who loves the turbo jam videos. Was disappointed because it was difficult to understand the leader saying what movement was coming up next and often she didn't say at all. You obviously just need to love the OTHER turbojam movies and get this one as an addition to that collection. It's not meant to be an introduction to the exercise genre.
1,Pathetic,"I was one of this fellow's students at a Pacoima, California junior high school in the early sixties. He was a poor teacher who was completely out of his depth, then went on to write this pathetic fabrication by way of revenge.I can't believe this trash is still around. It's not an indictment of the L.A. school system so much as of the African-American race, which is depicted as hopelessly uneducable.Give this bit of trash the burial in obscurity it deserves."
4,Uplifting Look At Hip Hop's International Reach,"As someone who grew up in NYC, probably in the 2nd generation of hip-hop, right around the time it was entering its 'golden era', I can appreciate the message that this documentary presented. Hip-hop can and does inspire people, all around the world. This documentary focuses on the story of 3 eminently positive individuals who use hip-hop as the basis for their political activism and as a refuge from the harshness of life's realities for the poor and oppressed, who typically are people of color.Shame that this documentary has only recently been distributed in America, as the source material is almost 10 years old at this point. I found it a bit sad that the Brazilian rapper learned a lot about America through rap, but we conversely know little of Brazilian rap, and little of Brazilian history and culture."
2,was disappointed,"the title made me think it would really discuss adoption and loss. the book got crosswise, too much clinical and not enough real people"
3,Yoga of Self-Revelation,"The author appears sincere in expressing her heart and esoteric knowledge gained. The author achieved her knowledge largely through self-revelation. The description of how she arrived by it is incomplete, but this is the most fascinating part of the book. No recognized teachers identified but there's strong Tibetan Buddhist influence. Definitely a first-time writer's effort. I recommend buying it used from Amazon Marketplace."
1,Plodding on the rooftops,Sincere but pedestrian. The author appears to be very impressed with her own accomplishments. Keeps on mentioning it over and over. This trait usually indicates a small mind. The author's heart seems to be in a right place though. Overall--don't bother.Go to the original sources.
2,ALLISON,"SERVICE WAS OK ,THE DESCRIPTION SHOULD TELL CUSTOMER THAT IT ONLY ONE SEAT BELT PER-ORDER,SO I END UO WITH ONE SEAT BELT COMFORTER,THANK YOU."
5,The best tote yet!,"I have several of the rolling tote style organizers and this is the only one I have truly been happy with! With all kinds of pockets and spaces, this tote stores it all! It has adjustable spaces and a removable pen organizer that can be made into a stand on your workspace. The very best feature is it doesn't tip over when you load it, something I have run into with other designs. This is definitely a must for the scrapper!"
5,Officer Organizer,"This is sturdy tote I am using as a portable office organizer. I must transport many files and binders between my job and home. This tote keeps my work organized, dry, and secure. The zippers can even be locked with suitcase locks if necessary. Afew of my co-workers who also transport numerous files are looking at purchasing this tote."
5,Rolling cart,This cart is exceptional for my needs. It is very mobile and I find it will hold all my things I need to transport.
5,Huge,This thing is huge and holds a lot. The removable pockets are great for organizing. I have a lot of stamps and it organizes all of it.
