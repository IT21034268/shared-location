5,A Real Page Turner,"When I watched ""City Confidential"", I was a little angry at Kim Carpenter Clinton for her promiscuity. After reading M. William Phelps' well written page turner of a book, I know the reason for it. Kim got no affection or support from her family. It was all ""Beth Ann this and Beth Ann that.""Her parents were the pits....absolute control freaks who treated Kim like an idiot. Cynthia Carpenter was so supposed to be so intelligent with all her degrees...maybe she needed a job or a hobby or, most of all, a life so she could stay out of Kim's business.I wonder how proud Cynthia and Richard Carpenter are now of their convicted murderer of a daughter.At least Kim didn't use every man she was with (poor Joseph). At least Kim didn't try to steal another woman's child.At least Kim isn't spending the rest of her life in prison.I couldn't put this book down. M. William Phelps knows how to write 'em!"
4,lethal guardian was a good read,I enjoyed the book. It held my attention and was an interesting read.I hope to read more books by this man.
4,Awesome,Awesome book. What a character Beth Ann! Got got what she deserved. Too bad there wasn't more on what Kim thought of her sister.
4,Good Read,M. William Phelps is one of the best true crime writers because of his detailed accounts and the passion he puts into his re-telling of the story.You won't be disappointed.
5,A Bold Reminder That ANYONE is Capable of Murder,"Author M. William Phelps writes the mouth-dropping, mind-boggling tale of the Carpenters and the Clintons, described perfectly within as modern ""Hatfields and McCoys."" This well written story is the twisted actions of two attorneys, most specifically Beth Ann Carpenter, who would do anything for love and custody of Beth Ann's niece, Rebecca, respectively. And to accomplish their goals, they seek out low life criminals who will do anything for money to fund their criminal lifestyles.I found this book to be one of the best true crime stories I have read. It has everything an avid true crime reader loves including dirty little secrets, sordid affairs and kinky sex, devoted parents, and thrill of the chase.Five stars to this top author and his exceptional true crime book!"
1,Simply dreadful,"Tedious and incoherent. I read 3-4 books a week, and of the 150-200 I purchased last year, this may have been the absolute worst."
2,This was grade A stinkin,"Geez, this was one awful Anime. The subtitle letters are far too big and the plot could not even come close to Evangelion's, nor could the robot battles. The story just dragged on and on, it was puttin me away bigtime. If you don't nod off in the first 20 minutes, somthings not right with your sleeping habits. The theme music was ground zero too, it didn't really rock the room. I would only suggest this video to you if you wana blow alot of money for no reason. The animation is desent but I really don't recommend this title if your lookin for some real action packed butt kicking like I was."
2,Not what I expected.,"Smaller than I expected it to be, and very dull for silver. I put it in jewelry cleaner and polished it out to a better shine. Other than that, the metal stamp was without complaint, as you can clearly see the front and the Navy logo on the back."
1,not B-Real,"I had to get a refund because this is not B-Real's Gunslinger Album. I rated it 1 star because they wouldn't allow zero stars. Listen to the clips to hear B-Real's voice before you purchase. Itunes had the same wrong album. I had found samples of the real album on another website, which has B-Real rapping. Don't buy without a listen. Me I'm waiting for this to be updated, otherwise I'll buy a hard copy."
2,Music Grates your nerves,"I love every aspect of this game, but there is no option to turn OFFthe Background Music. This is a major complaint I have about allgames. If you want to hear the sound effects only, you aint getting ithere."
5,Mario Cart Super Circut is awsome,"I got Mario Cart for my birthday and I love it. You can even get a special cup if you get 1st,2nd or 3rd in all the cups. The graphics are good and you get neat weapons to slow down enemys. For example, if you go through an item box you get an item say you get a red shell. If you shot it at a opponet it automatically hits them."
4,Mario Kart Super Circut: A fun game with a good battle mode.,I like the battle mode the best. The racing mode isent that fun.
4,Great Game for the console,"This is a great game. There are a whole bunch of levels, and they are all completely different. The graphics are some of the best that I have seen for the system. All of the power ups and weapons make it even better. This game is even better because it has 3 different speed levels. The lowest speed is very easy and the highest speed is very hard. So it is good for all skill levels. There are also bonus tracks that you can unlock, and they are very fun. The only flaw in the game is turning. You basically slide,a nd it is very hard to control when turning. Overal this is a very good game and I recommend that you buy it."
5,Better than Mario Kart 7,"I just got this in 2011 and I love it I would recomend it to any one who started mario kart on the wii, ds, and 3DS!"
4,One of my favorites for the GBA,Fun game but the graphics r not as good as the 64s. It is more like the snes version for graphics anyway. I played this game all the time when it first came out. It was the only GBA game i wanted to play after a while. It has a good two player mode not many GBA games had two player. I thought the graphics were good at first untill i got the ds mario kart and i stoped playing it. Then i thought the graphics were horrible but u got to remember its the GBA and it came out in 2001. Now its 2009 and sometimes i still play it. The 64 graphics were only better because nintindo went computerized with is so it had more of unblocky graphics. But this and the snes have about the same graphics. The sound is pretty good so over all i give this game a 7.5/10 but mostly because of the graphics compared to the ds but i got to remember that it is 8 years old.
4,...,"So you like Mario? You like the Mario Kart games? You wish you could play Mario Kart while on the road? Here is your wish: Mario Kart Advance. What a great game this one is, with new levels, sharp graphics and sound, the same characters, and massive fun. Though it is more similar to the SNES version of Mario Kart, you can not complain about this game in any way. It is hard or easy depending on the speed you play it at, and this game is just a rush...There is one flaw with this game though that stood out to me. Whoever the first 4 players to win the first round of the series of races, are the same 4 players that will be in the top 4 the rest of the series, UNLESS you play on 150 cc , or possibly 100 cc. That aside, this is a great game, nonetheless."
5,Best GBA game BY FAR!!!!!!!!,"This actually was one of the first GBA games relased...but it is still one of the best. To start off, the graphics are awsome!!! and it as all the features as the original..like the red shells, bannana peels...YOU NAME IT. Also, another fun thing to do is race 2 player and the best part is... YOU ONLY NEED 1 GAME CARTRIDGE. your friend can play even if he does not own the game.Overall 9.8 out of 10"
5,Mario Kart Super Circuit,"Mario Kart Super Circuit is a great deal. With 20 courses, different modes, fun characters, and super graphics, Super Circuit is the best GBA racing game ever. Special feature is 1 cartridge can play up to 4 players with just the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable (too bad it's not included). There's eight different characters including Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Wario. The controls are simple with attacking items that can make yourself defensive and a sudden burst of speed. Others can make enemy racers lose items and crash. In Mario Kart Super Circuit, there's different cups, Mushroom (easy, Flower (medium), Thunder (hard), Star (advanced), and last but not least the Special Cup(win all four cups to compete in the Special Cup.)1(worst) to 10(best) rating scaleGraphics 9Character 10Game Play 9Difficulty 8Overall 9"
2,Not the best Mario Kart game.,"I love Mario Kart, but this version is not that good. steering is terrible here, you have to use the R or L button and it feels uncomfortable and you feel like you getting out of control (especially on 150c). Few things that I like is that they have the courses from the original super mario kart game(SNES), and it sounds really cute but still, it doesn't make it any better. BUT because of its cuteness it could be a great game for a little kid."
3,it's O.K.,"this game was o.k. when I first got it, but now it's pretty much bore me to death. It's just like all the other racing games, only with mario and his friends. This game's a stinko!!!"
1,Horrible Game!,"Do not buy this game. It&#65533;s short, boring, and old! If you want a good game I recommend Mario Kart: Double Dash."
5,Mario Kart Super Circuit= Best Mario Kart Game Yet!,"Although on the box the graphics seem [lousy], once you put in the cartridge the graphics are crystal clear! It is highly addictive and although it is easy to beat, it is one of the only games you can enjoy once you beat it. Also the multiplayer mode puts this game over the top! I recommend this game to EVERYONE!"
4,yup.......... cool,"this game is cool, but the N64 version is better. better apperance, better handling and more battle modes, but i guess this will do while on the go."
4,Super Circuit = Super Fun,"Even if you aren't a Mario Kart fan, TRY THIS GAME AT LEAST ONCE! YOU WILL NOT BE LET DOWN! Race in many different worlds competing against the computer with 3 different challenging levels. All your favorite characters from the Mario games are here. Can't choose just one racer? Use the random selection mode! Race through the Sky Garden or conquer Bowser's Castle or, if you want, you can go back to the classic SUPER MARIO KART tracks! A great game! Here's how I rate it:Fun= *****Graphics= ***** (very good for GBA)Sound= *****Gameplay= **** (hard to control when you first start out, but you adjust to the handling of the karts)Challenge= *****(3 different modes plus multiplayer!)24/25 stars!BUY THIS GAME! YOU WON'T REGRET IT AT ALL!"
3,It is ok,"If you have a similar game called Mario Kart for Nintendo 64... i don't recommend getting this game. They are way too similar and you will get bored quickly. All it is is a racing game. It does not have battle mode on it like Mario Kart. I played with it for a very short amount of time. I did not like it because I had played Mario Kart for so long. If you think you will enjoy this game because you dont have mario kart, then buy it. This game is very nice. It has many tracks, and it can be quite challenging. Overall I would not get it if u have Mario Kart. But it is a decent game..."
4,mario kart,"It is very fun but a short game. It only took me an hour and a half to beat it when I first got it.The graphics are perfict, it feels like you are playing it on Nintendo 64."
4,A GREAT GAME {AGAIN} INCLUDING EVERYONES FAVORITE CHARACTER.,"All the Game Boy and GBA games with Mario were great, but it doesn't get any better than this. A portable version of Mario Kart is what everyone would want. A very fantastic game. 5 STARS!!!!!!"
2,Where'd the fun go?,"The graphics are good, the sound is good.....but it's just missing something. It's quite boring on the Game Boy, and i regret buying this game....there's a reason why there's 16 used copies for sale up there...."
5,BEST GAME EVER GOING TO EXIST ON GBOY ADVANCE!!,Well theres a lot to say about mario kart on snes and on 64 then when i heard about it on Advance i thought This is going to be awsome because i knoe i loved the snes Version and i loved the N64 version but now its back and better then ever with help from the brilliant G Boy advance Lucky me i got to sample it... AND IT IS 10 TIMES BETTER THAN WHAT I THOUGHt!! Soon i was lost in the moment Its colors and levels were Brilliant and amazing and it has 20 more tracks!! and you can link to 4 of your friends THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BEST G BOY ADVANCE GAMES EVER MADE SO GET IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!
3,I've had it since day one,I wanted this bad back then and when I got it I was bored quick even for GBA. It's just a mix bag for racing... even after so long it is hit of mis no matter what mario fans say. I guess at best 50% great if you agree with the 5 star people but if you dis-like it then look for what they hate.My reaview in the end is good but repetative short 50 to 100 to 150. Just makes its a short run game or its just a game with easy to hard.
5,Best GBA game ever!,"I have a DS and have beaten all of my games. I am currently waiting for the new good games to come out in March (Need For Speed, Mario Kart DS, ect.) As I wait, I'm playing Mario Kart Super Circuit. The game has great graphics, maybe the best for all game boy games ever. The gameplay is great. It reminds me of the N64 version. Also, I would like to say that if you hold ""B"" as you are turning, you can make sharper turns. Many people have complained about this. It has the same characters and wepons as the N64 version. It also has improvment such as it is portable, new tracks, and it is harder. My only complaints are that the tracks are flat and the laps are short so one mistake kills you. Seeing this version I can't wait for the Mario Kart DS to come out."
4,Quick Thinking,"I think this game is really fun for two players,but for one, once you beat it, it gets somewhat boring."
5,WOW! This is really excellent.,"Ok, as soon as I started playing this game, I immedietly fell in love with it. The graphics are as good as if not better than those of Super Mario Kart 64 for Nintendo 64 and the music is fun to listen to. This game is pretty much exactly like Super Mario Kart 64, but there are new and better courses. I could play this game for hours on end, but thankfully my mom saved me from becoming a videogameaholic. I really got hooked on this game.I would recommend this game for all gamers."
4,Excellent Racing Game,"I own this gmae and I love it! It has great racing cups (tracks) for you to use for racing. There are four different cups; Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Lightning Cup, and Star Cup. I sure would say that anybody that like racing, get this game for your GameBoy Advance/GameBoy Advance SP."
1,Very bad easel,This is one of those situations where you get what you pay for. Don't spend your money on this piece of junk. Spend a little more and get something good. This easel is cheaply made and assembled incorrectly from the manufacturer. The worst part is it doesn't hold the canvas firmly. Just a bad easel.
5,Every Business Owner Should Read this Book,"Once again, Lance has hit the nail on the head on how to create a healthy long term sustainable enterprise.Any firm that is committed to the CASTLE ( Courage, Authenticity, Service, Trust, Love and Effectiveness) is right on.I highly recommend this book as well as Lance as a keynote speaker or consultant to your business.Debbie McGrath CEO HR.com"
3,Art and Practice of Conscious Leadership,Very good service and product. Definitely will continue to shop Amazon and refer to friends.
4,I'm Feeeelin This!,"The music on this cd is mesmorizing,and addictive. I fell on my bed to listen to it, and fell into the waters of the Carribean instead!! This is a must buy!"
4,Don't know what that other guy was talking about...,"...but this book is a good introduction to the bass. No, there's not a lot of pictures other than the most basic fingering techniques, and it doesn't have a bunch of ""hot licks"". However, it contains all the fundamentals you need to start playing bass. It goes through all the major/minor scales, chords, the circle of fifths, blues progressions; in other words, it teaches you ""how to play bass guitar"". I played trombone for 8-9 years so I knew the scales & how to read bass clef, but I still needed to know how to translate that to the bass. This book works just fine for that."
5,this is a good method book for teachers to use,"I use this book to teach my bass guitar students, mostly because it is very sequential and it does not use tab. It teaches notes in half/first position, one string at a time, using enharmonic spelling and only using standard notation. Eventually students can play a chromatic scale in first position and then are ready to play simple duets or songs.I don't think I'd recommend this book for ""do-it-yourselfers,"" but then again I don't recommend trying to teach yourself an instrument anyway.If you want to stand out as a musician, let alone a bass guitarist, learn to read music in standard notation and chord symbols, and learn a variety of styles and genres of music. This book can help you do that, if used in conjuction with private instruction and a good teacher.If you have a teaching studio and teach bass guitar, this book provides a solid method that actually teaches fluency on the instrument and standard notation - highly recommended."
3,Not my cup of tea,"Well I actually found this one by way of Bookstore Junkies and it was only $4.00. It wasn't worth the wait of over 3 years to find, this is just my opinion. It would have probably appealed to me more if I had read it back in 1985 but it was rather frustrating at times, the heroine and the hero kept doing some things that at times were very nerve wracking. I know that SEP changed some things in it for the new one ""Just Imagine"" and I'm hoping that it actually is better than the orignal."
2,Out of the box and not all switches work.,"9-17-2012: I have always wanted electric windows in my truck. Found this kit and also the factory style regulators with motors for my truck. However, after installing both regulators and running the wires, I found that at least one out of three switches will not activate the window to roll down. I have double checked the wiring by swapping out the switches from one door to the other to only find the problem changed sides with the switch in question. SO now, I am looking for some answers from Amazon as to how they go about troubleshooting and making a warranty adjustment to resolve my problem. More to come after I get in touch with Amazon!Amazon says to get in contact with Electric-life.com for troubleshooting and warranty information so using their contact us link on that site. More to come I assume.9-18-2012 day two.Waiting for Electric-life.com to respond to my request for help."
2,Too Small To Enjoy,"I wish I had noticed the book was so small before ordering. Ten paintings are full page illustrations, and the rest of the art is a half page or less. There is a lot of great information in small type, but if you are looking for a book to enjoy viewing Moreau's wonderful art, you might be as disappointed as I was."
3,Magic and Symbols,"very useful for y research project: the mystical aspect of Moreau's work is thoroughly explored and clearly explained, which is not an obvious task!"
2,Tea set cannot get wet!,My 3 year old and 10 year old daughters loved painting the set. Problem is you cannot use it as a tea set. Decorative only. Once it is wet or used a week after painting the paint comes off and it is not to be used with water or any other liquid. Too bad because making it is lots of fun.
4,Perfect for the MXL 67 series,"If you are considering purchasing a MXL 67 series Microphone? Do it. This is a must have. You can mount the microphone shockmount as show (top mount) or inverted as a hanging microphone, if you prefer. I have not tested its isolation yet but it seems to be made well. Well worth the money."
5,MXL 57 MICROPHONE SHOCKMOUNT,"I gave this product five stars because it was shipped to me quickly. Also, it met my expectations for my MXL microphone. It is not made too cheaply, but be careful when handling. Good for small and or large home studios (buy two if you want). Try one. Great for tight budget!"
1,stay away from this,"This is such a risky mic mount to use and I'll tell you why.The way this works is you put your mic into it and force it in so it grabs it. It's just by force and nothing holds it in.Eventually one day your mic will slip out of it because that's the law of gravity. Your mic will break or be messed up.There is nothing to secure your mic into it to keep it from slipping or falling out one day.I have my mic in it now and I'm actually scared that it could drop any minute. It's not that tightly in there and if anything it gets loser ever second.This mount reminds me of a car GPS mount for the front window, eventually the mount always falls no matter what if you leave it on long enough.Do you want your mic falling one day? Is that a feeling you want to have? Don't chance it! Stay away from this!This is fairly cheaply made and insanely overpriced."
2,Manfrotto 394,"Hard to unlease. It didn't work well for me, so I sent it back. It was made very well, but I had problems getting it to snap in place and a tuff time getting it unattached."
1,Inert lump of metal,"This bulky, sturdy-looking little camera plate arrived and is totally unusable. This should be a simple device: push the lever, release the plate, right? Well, the lever simply doesn't move, despite what the ""helpful"" diagram indicates it should do.Feeling like an idiot, I handed to 4 or 5 other folks and none of us, examining the included documentation and device could get the thing to release its death grip on the ""quick"" release plate. In desperation, I went looking for a contact number for Manfrotto customer support. No such luck, just an email form.This one is getting returned - I'm mightily unimpressed that such an expensive little gadgetA. Doesn't work out of the box.B. Doesn't include a good customer service solution when things go awry."
2,Hell hath no fury...,"I have been reading Deathlands and Outlanders from the beginning. Like others, I lament the old days when we had good strong characterization and plots that not only made sense but hung together. I'm afraid this book isn't one of them. It isn't the worst in the series, but sadly it is lacking. The basic plot is Ok, but wouldn't Kristy look over the cliff and see Ryan? Without this major error there is no reason for the plot. Also ""the little ones"" what the heck is that about? Some psychic rats who heal Ryan for no apparent reason? A little Deux de machina, if you ask me--the sure sign of the author not knowing how to get himself out of a hole he put himself into. It would have been a more interesting book to watch Ryan deal with his fate by himself. The other companions are presented fairly well, but the characterization of Ryan and THE STUPID LINES given to him in dialog is painful to read. So other than the plot and poor characterization, this is a tolerable read."
5,Pioneer The King,"I bought this center speaker to compliment my new pioneer digital receiver. And the sound is unbeatable. I replaced an RCA 200 watts rms center speaker. And though the pioneer center speaker is only 130 watts rms it puts out sound 100% better than the RCA center speaker. You can hear the voices much clearer. It also produces fantastic highs and creates a much more full base when combined with my subwoofer and front speakers. You will have no regrets if you combine this center speaker properly with your other speakers. Buy one. Try it. You can always return it if not satisfied. And by the way it can also be used as a front or back speaker. It comes with the hardware to stand the speaker upright. Another great feature is that the case is all solid aluminum. Also the wire terminals accept banana plugs. And lastly, "" They look great "".JQJR"
4,Blends well but doesn't chop,"First of all, the Korean video showing how to use this machine to make, for example, homemade (with raw egg) mayonnaise in which you might like to dip your ""cookies"" or ""squid"" is so funny it's almost worth the price of the processor!As for this cute little machine: It blends well and fast, and it's very easy to use and to clean up. It takes up just a wee bit of counter space. It's great for smoothies, shakes, margaritas, purees, and such. However, it won't chop or dice, just pulverize. I had mostly needed something to replace a mini vegetable chopper that had died, so now I still have to replace that."
4,It's a beautiful film!,"The children are charming and wonderful to watch, and their relationships with each other and the old man and endearing. It's a good adventure story, and I'm surprised the official reviews weren't better."
2,MORE 1970S KUNG FU SILLINESS,"A COP [BRUCE LI] IS AFTER A LIST OF GANG MEMBERS, LITTLE KNOWING THAT 2 GANGS ARE ALSO AFTER THE LIST. HAS A FEW GOOD FIGHT SCENES, BUT THE STORY'S EXTREMELY INCOHERENT AND THE FILM MIGHT AS WELL BE PLOTLESS. FILMMAKERS OF MARTIAL ARTS FILMS MUST'VE BEEN REALLY DESPERATE FOR MONEY, JUDGING FROM ALL THE 1970S AND EARLY-1980S MARTIAL ARTS FILMS I'VE SEEN THAT HAD BRUCE LEE'S NAME IN ITS TITLE. BRUCE LI IS IN GOOD FORM, BUT LET'S FACE IT, HE'S NOT BRUCE LEE AND HE NEVER WILL BE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD MARTIAL ARTS FILM, LOOK ELSEWHERE."
5,"A good followup to ""Life After Life""","This book was written after Moody's ""Life After Life,"" and is basically the same. And, like its predecessor, it is well-written and readable. The material is again fascinating, I recommend it, along with ""Life after Life""--about which I wrote this: a warm and readable book about a fascinating subject: What happens at death, or near death? It is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor. And, in spite of the fact that I am a Christian, with conservative beliefs, and even though I maintain my faith carefully focused on God, I do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence (along with its companion, written subsequently, ""Life Beyond Death""). I invite you to read it and see why."
3,"Uplifting theme, but no substance","While the overall theme of the book is uplifting, there is nothing new in this book. The author attempts to answer some of the critics, and provides a few stories quoted from other books. I would consider this a high level look at NDEs with little or no research done by the author for this book. The tone of the book was very spiritual, but not religious if that makes senses.One thing I did not care for was the unsubstantiated generalizations that he would make. Such as, ""all or almost all NDEs are positive,"" which is paraphrasing. He didn't back statements like this up with any facts. He did provide statistics from Ring's book and another researcher on the common experiences between NDEs. All in all this book is a research light book, and more of a response to criticisms of NDEs."
3,"I was expecting more, do I have to have an NDE?","The Light Beyond is a wonderful book, but so many people just focus on their own lessons they learned, which makes for an interesting story, but I am always looking for more - how does this apply to me? Do I have to have an NDE myself? I liked Tiffany Snow's book better, just one chapter about her great NDE, but the rest of it shows how anyone can open up, if they learn how. I'm not saying The Light Beyond is a bad book, really, but I guess I was just expecting more."
1,This product does not work on the new version of the PS2,"This product does not work on the new version of the PS2. The new PS2 recognizes the adaptor, but the adaptor doesn't power up the controllers."
3,fun with friends,the multiplayer adapter is very good when you have a big screen tv and you have four friends over but when your by your self it's just a waste of money
5,FIRST RATE TRIBUTE,"Jeff Richman has the ability to reshape guitar greats music in a way that shows what impressive compositions they had created. ""To Beck and Back"" is another triumph. Steve Morse is a master at tributes as testified with his ""Major Impacts"" discs and he again nails the ""Beck Style"" on Freeway Jam. Steve Lukather and Larry Carlton did a definitive take on The Pump but Warren Haynes adds bluesy emphasis for a fresh listen. Has anyone ever attempted a remake of Beck's Bolero? Eric Johnson does a good job. An all star cast throughout, Mike Stern, Greg Howe, Walter Trout, John Scofield, Adam Rogers, Chris Duarte, and of course Jeff Richman make this a ""Five Star"" highly recommended disc."
2,Legends playing legends dont equal a legend......,Jeff Beck is one of the truly distinctive guitarists in rock and fusion history. His approach and technique is unmistakeable. Most of the guitarists on this disc are also renowned in their own rights. However with a few high energy exceptions (Steve Morse's Freeway Jam) this disc is like listening to a medium scale cover band at a sports bar. I would suggest that listeners stick to the original catalogs of both Beck and the participating guitarists.
2,Solos Phoned In,"Jeff Beck deserves more credit for his work as an instrumental rock-fusion guitarist than the recordings on this album suggest. While the performances of both the rhythm section and featured soloists are technically superb, a review of the liner notes reveals that the basic tracks were recorded at a single location, with each of the soloists recording their part at a different studio, presumably to make the project more feasible from a logistic perspective. However, what this results in is a lack of energy and interaction between the soloist and rhythm section, and ends up sounding like a who's who of guitar performing with ""music minus one"" backing tracks. For a truly inspiring cover of Beck's ""The Pump"", check out Larry Carlton and Steve Lukather onNo Substitutions: Live in Osakainstead."
1,Cisco ASA 5505 security appliance,"I would not recommend this product unless you are a competent, Cisco certified network engineer. I spent a week trying to make it work. I read the manual, surfed google how to's and even bought a booklet on the subject, but the appliance refused to work as designed. I bought a Linksys SSL VPN for half the price and it everything including the VPN was working in 1 hour.A colleague of mine also had the same experience a while back. He returned it also. The one good thing is that Amazon have a really good return policy."
1,WTF 32 internal IP addresses?!?!?!?,"Even with the bundled book's I still can't get the computers in the network to access the internet. They must think everyone knows what they know! HA, most don't, that's why they have to write manuals (which treat you like you were there when they built the darn thing). Also another unrepresented and disclosed important piece of information that everyone should know before purchase is with the licensing that comes with the unit you can only have 32 internal IP addresses, WTF, I can buy a $100.00 router and get 255 internal IP addresses. I feel like I need a college degree to program this device. Be warned it's not plug and play, be prepared to do a lot of reading and hair pulling.Very disappointed!!!!"
3,Nice track section; but a word of caution about the wire,"Th derailer track section is fine, but the wire that conects the track to the controller is terminated with spade lugs and is not compatible with the 3.5mm connectors on the recent versions of controllers. Not having a suitable 3.5mm connector on hand, I finally opened the controller and hard-wired the wire-ends directly to the back of the controller's connector. 'No problems after that."
4,Supernatural romance,"Three stories for the price of one. I enjoyed all the stories, especially the one by author Hannah Howell. I read all her books."
4,worth reading,"I thought this book was riveting and worth reading. It was spell binding and I finshed it in less than 24 hours, even though I do work and I just could not put it down."
4,A little imagination......................,"I enjoyed this book. I normally read contemporary romances, but this was given to me as a gift. I have decided to read more books by these authors. This book is written in 3rd person (for those who do not like 1st person written books!)."
2,Missing Essentials,"My second fave theme from this series -- next to Hillary Duff's title song -- was the outro instrumental, and it's NOT THERE!!! Additionally, even with reference to Duff's title song, I love the version that graced the series -- it was crisp and taught -- whereas the one given to us on the CD is different and ersatz. Very disappointing on both accounts. These were the chief reasons I wanted to possess the CD!"
3,I love Laguna Beach.,"This c.d. wasn't everything I hoped it would be but, I was good enough for the price."
1,Never shipped this item!,Amazon never did ship this item. Had to ask for a refund as my son's project was due before the 3+week delayed shipping could come through!
2,I'm sorry I'm wasting space in an already full bookcase.,"There is relatively no content (and what little there is is less than clever). I wonder if the author has even had a cat. Some of the illustrations are amusing, though. Bottom line - save your money."
3,Cute,"This book was quite cute, however, I expected a little more out of it. It's one of those books thay you can read in 10 or 15 minutes - not worth the money unless you're getting it as a gift or you just have money to burn. Pick it up in the library or just read it in Borders."
5,Zen for Cats,"As with all Henry Beard's books, it is a pretty humorous read for any cat lover. I was impressed that it arrived a month before the later of the anticipated delivery dates and was in perfect condition."
4,"Taken in his genre, Beard's ""Zen for Cats"" is amusing.","I found, as did several of my younger friends (and perhaps I should definee ""younger""---high schoolers) that the book offered certain insights, but was mostly funny and very funny in spots. I think if you liked Beard's other books (check amazon.com), you will enjoy this.If you like Barbara Holland's writing---you'll thoroughly enjoy Beard's."
4,"Palmetto people may hate it, but you must read the book.",Read this book to really know the Cracker South. If you are interested in organizing people you will learn first hand about the unionization of the Cuban cigar workers.This is Dixie in all its rawness! Learn of the real South. Nobody is exempt from its biting edge.
3,Palmetto Country Florida,"Pretty good book. I am a Native Floridian and this book offered a lot of info. I did think there would be more of a story base to the book, but I don't regret reading it non-the-less."
5,Does the job well,"Nice wall mountable hose rack. Cabinet is small, but works for small hose nozzles and adapters, very adequate. Holds the hose well. If you want more storage than this one go for the bigger version. This one is in my back yard and I have the larger one out front which, again, the storage is smaller than it looks but it has a shelf and a little more storage."
1,Bad,Product was not like said in description. Description was very confusing to non american speaking people. Would like refund or alterintve product.
4,Good Book but only covers the basics,"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Paint Shop Pro 7 by Nat Gertler isa really good book to buy if you are buying Paint Shop Pro 7 for the very first time and have never used any of the previous versions of Paint Shop Pro.This book is well written and it easily explains all of the applications it outlines.However, I have been using Paint Shop Pro version 5 for about three years now and there was nothing in this book that I didn't already know.The best way to find new tips and tricks that Paint Shop Pro 7 has is to read online tutorials and find sites set up for such instructions.As my review title says, it's a ""Good Book but only covers the basics""!"
2,Poor book or wrong reader?,"I used to be quite suspicious of ""Complete Idiot's Guide"" series (and ""For Dummies"" as well) and would never buy a book without prior browsing it. But in this case I was fully convinced by the excellent recommendations of the reviewers and the relatively high (i.e. actually low) sales rank. So, when the book arrived, I eagerly started to look it through for selective topics and ... at once got disappointed because of the lack or even absence of the important material. For instance, just several short lines are dedicated to the Sharpen Menu, and the Unsharp Mask parameters are not explained at all. As for Histogram Functions, considered to be one of the most important tools, they are not even mentioned. Incredible! What's up? Am I a wrong reader? Not a ""complete idiot""? May be. I don't know. I'm just returning the book and discouraging everybody from buying it."
3,Not bad,Pretty good book. Masks needed more in more depth coverage. Also there could have been more on editing photos.
2,Badly scratched,"The scraper looked like ground by very coarse (60 grit) sand drum. It was sligtly out of flat and took a few hours to flatten and polish. You know, the scraper's flat sides must be well polished, to get decent results. Still, one edge was crooked too much, it made it impossible to finish.After that, I polished the long edges and rolled a burr. It cut very well, even end grain and against grain."
4,company rip off,"Although the books are loved by children, buyer be aware that the international company that sells them charge you $168 for a 4 book gift set. They will not return my calls or emails."
5,Best for person with enlarge heart.,"I had enlarge heart and after using it for 6 month, 3 times a week, 20 minutes a day it has shrunk back almost to normal size.This machine gives you a good work out without impact on your joints.I highly recommend it.Just put in front of your TV and enjoy it."
4,My main focus was Dylan and I wasn't disappointed.,"Dylan played a character who didn't really exist so he hadn't much to go on as far as what to act like. I believe he based the character heavily on who he wanted to be and how he wanted the public to percieve him. It is widely known that Peckinpah wrote the character in for Dylan and no one else. I was delighted by Dylan's performance as the quiet, mysterious Alias because I could tell that there wasn't a whole lot of acting involved and I felt like I was watching most of the real Dylan. All the looks and sighs under his breath and characteristic puckered lips- all Bob."
3,Patty Garrett,"Classic western. James Coburn is a standout as usual. Kris Kristofferson is just honing his craft at this point in his career. If you can overlook the Bob Dylan role, you can really enjoy this movie."
3,Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid starring James Coburn, Kris Kristoffersen and special appearances with Bob Dylan. Was an enjoyable movie although I wonder about the authenticity of the story."
4,pat garret & billy the kid,I first saw this movie when it came out some thirty years ago. I wanted to share it with my daughter recently who is into Bob Dylan. When I watched it again I was really intrigued by the sound track & scenes. Dylanwas young & funny without trying to be. Kristofferson was cool. A great revisit to a time gone by. Classic film!!
2,Good for 5 things,"1. Watching Bob Dylan act, sort of. 2. Lots of naked female torsos 3. James Coburn 4. LOTS of blood spurting out of bullet holes. 5. The soundtrack. That's about it. Kris Kristofferson's acting is a joke."
3,Muddled Western,"James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson give charismatic turns as Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. It's unfortunate that their efforts are stranded in an incoherent narrative. The film alludes to their past friendship but little light is shed on it's true nature. Billy is treated as something of a folk hero because supposedly he is a thorn in the side of the land barons but that theme isn't really elaborated on. Sam Peckinpah employs his trademark slo-mo bloodshed but it doesn't have the resonance that it did in film's like ""The Wild Bunch"". Bob Dylan, who does contribute a superb soundtrack, gives an inert performance as an actor. His high point is reading the labels on food cans. Rita Coolidge, Kristofferson's then wife, breaks form and shares his bed. I watched the director's cut without seeing the truncated or expanded editions of the film. I can't see where they could be any worse."
4,"Kris, Rita and Bob Dylan...a 70's classic","A pretty good storyline, well cast and featuring two well known western actors (Jason Robards and James Coburn) and two Folk-Rock icons, Kris Kristofferson; along with his wife at the time, Rita Coolige, and a young Bob Dylan. Sam Pekinpaugh's direction and attention to detail is superb. Dylan is almost believable as a cowboy.The plot is a bit shallow (by today's standards) and the gunfight scenes may be a bit too bloody for some, but all-in-all it's a 70's Americana Classic."
5,one of the classic in westerns,THIS MOVIE FOR KRIS [Kristofferson]IS ONE OF BEST AS BIIIY THE KID HE PUT ANOTHER SPIN ON THE OUTLAW WHO KILL WITHOUT ANY CARE BUT TRANFORM HIM INTO A ANTIESTABLISHMENT HERO PUT THIS MOVIE ON DVD
4,"Una compra antes de lo esperado, con un pequeño defecto","Recibí el dvd mucho antes de la fecha posible de entrega. Qué alegría, pero la caja está quebrada, qué lástima. No es un grave problema, el producto es maravilloso, pero siempre queremos tener las cosas en perfecto estado..."
2,Can We Please Get Some ... Wide Screen Action?,"Let me tell you something, I like this movie, but I think that Sam filmed a great deal of it while carrying a foriegn load. ...Kris Kristoferson and James Coburn sleepwalk through their roles, while Bob Dylan produces the [worst] movie soundtrack of the early seventies. His acting [is bad], too."
1,revolting prelude,"I hate this film and ""The Ballad of Cable Hoge,"" because of its depiction of animal cruelty. This happens just at the prelude of both films."
4,"""How's Jesus look to you now Bob?""","This is a classic western and one of Sam Peckinpah's greatest. I found the dialouge and the chemistry between James Coburns Pat Garrett and Kris Kristoffersons Billy the Kid to be mesmerizing. Kristofferson was very young in this part and fairly inexperienced as an actor but it doesn't show one bit. The costumes and the period are portrayed perfectly. The characters are dirty, crash, and wild. There are many colorful characters portrayed by a lot of famous character actors that you have probably seen in a ton of movies. Slim Pickens is also here in a brief but memorable role. The Kid and Garretts friendship is what holds the movie together and even though they don't show their early outlaw years together they don't have to. You can feel that the two have a long relationship and that their friendship runs very deep.Check this movie out if you want to see a great western and just a plain great piece of movie making."
3,An ok resource for deep researchers only,This book was required for my son's honors composition class. The teacher decided to use something else at the last minute. It is a good source for post graduate research.
3,Misinformed,"I am a college Freshman and I was required to get this book for research and MLA purposes. Our instructor explained that there were different editions for the book each put in print within the same year, and the only way to decipher between them would be a colored dot on the cover. Unfortunately for me, the image shown for this product had an orange dot on the cover (the product the teacher told us to acquire) while the copy I received in the mail did not. I was not pleased to find that the dot had not fallen off, since it was an image not a sticker, but I can still use the product.When I received it, it was in good condition and full of information for me. My only concern is that at times I wonder if I'm using the wrong information when writing my papers. It would have been more professional to show a distinction between the books or actually show an accurate edition of the book being sold (in the picture)."
2,Love Cake Mix Doctor books but this time was disappointed,"I have several of Anne Byrn' s books and loved them. So I thought I'd try the Kindle version. Something must be off in the formatting as I found the book layout very choppy in several places. So while I loved the content, the formatting is why I'm giving it 2 stars. I doubt I buy any more cookbooks in Kindle form. A waste of money, if it's choppy to read people aren't going to want to want to waste their time or money on it. Very disappointed."
2,Ok if you don't know much..,"I bought this book hoping to get new ideas for baking cakes. I didn't find it very helpful but maybe for a new bride, a new cook..it would be more interesting for them."
2,can't fix the chocoholic,"The recipes I've tried were adequate, but none were spectacular. The souped-up chocolate cake recipes save on time but not likely to impress the serious baker."
2,Don't bother if you have her first book!,"On the hunch that this book would probably have a lot of reruns from the first book, I took it out of the library rather than buying it. And I was right -- there are a lot of exact repeats, plus a lot of repeats with chocolate or cocoa added (or using a chocolate cake mix instead of the original yellow, white, spice, etc). In some instances the recipes don't sound very appetizing -- I mean, Chocolate Pumpkin Cake? Chocolate Spice Cake?For me, there are more than enough chocolate recipes in the first book. Frankly, I wish she would do a lower-fat book. But probably the cakes would taste even more like cake mix if they weren't loaded up with extra butter, chocolate, sour cream, etc.However, I did try the ""Darn Good Chocolate Cake"" with low-fat sour cream and no chocolate chips, and it still turned out very well. (I did use the full amount of eggs and oil.)"
2,Get the First Book,"I agree with the reviewers who said not to bother getting this book if you have the first one. I was really looking forward to this book and it was a real let-down. The best recipe in this book, darn good chocolate cake (excellent, by the way), is available in the first book. I get the feeling the author was desperate to try to create enough recipes to fill this book, and it shows. Like another reviewer pointed out, the combinations are odd and often very unappetizing. Why on earth would she include not one, but TWO versions of chocolate lime cheesecake and not even one basic chocolate or chocolate chip cheesecake recipe? I can't comprehend that one. Stick to the first book, which is well worth the money."
4,for control freaks,"Most of today's tripod heads are great for quick settings, but for those who want to tweak the frame in tiny increments like i do, this is the one to get."
3,70's Camp Fun,"Adam West, dated seventies fashion and gratuitous nudity as only the seventies delivered in an overly earnest overripe soapy story of lust, conivance and betrayal.This no-frills DVD definately has a narrow audience but that audience is bound to relish it."
4,Mario party 7,this game is a fun adventure on a cruise. Bowser is trying to mess up their vacation. You have to solve puzzles to win. It is the BEST of all the Mario party games by far!
5,The best multiplayer game ever!!!,"This game is by far the best Mario Party game ever! It is better than Mario Party 6. However, it it more fun to play with human players. The more people, the better. I see some people are complaining that this game is too hard and that it is too violent. It isn't! Punching and kicking without gore is not violent. Get used to it. Also, this game is much harder than the other Mario Party games. But if you think it is too hard, there is something wrong with you. If this game were easy like the other Mario Parties, it wouldn't be fun. The Bowser Time is a great addition. It makes the game more fun.P.S. Who needs a handicap when the CPU is on weak? Pathetic."
3,I expected more than what it is for the price.,I expected more with microphone. also game is not so much interactive and planning.
3,meh its ok,"this was by FAR the best in the series, which is pretty sad. i suggest not buying the ""mario party"" series AT ALL"
1,?,"Nintendo why have you made 7 mario party games. This is dumb ok if you want a ""party"" game play the first 6.........6! do you want your great great great great grand kids to be playing mario party 500 on the game triangle? they want you do buy stuff for the gamecube so that youll buy more stuff for the next consul. it is probably fun but i don't recomend"
3,Mario Party 7,There is nothing special to Mario Party 7. Let me start off by saying that this game is only reccomended to those who don't already have a Mario Party game. This game does not have anything new to it.Pros*Two new characters (Dry Bones and Birdo)*The graphics look amazing as always*Sound is clear and loud*Mic is alot of fun to useCons*Most of the mini-games are not that much diffrent from the ones from all the other Mario Party*In the mode where where there are two teams as two each team moves together which meanes the game ends much fasterSound: 9/10 AGraphics: 8/10 AGamplay: 6.5/10 B-Overall: 7/10 B
4,Great Game Worth Purchasing,My kids just love this game. They have played it constantly since we got it and it attracts the neighbor kids as well. If you can catch it on sale and get the free shipping then it's definately worth it.
3,My least favorite Mario Party,"I have played every Mario Party game and sadly I have to say this is my least favorite. I still enjoyed it but some minigames can get very boring although there are many characters to choose from. The only board map that is fun to me is the one where you need to climb a mountain to get a star. The best Mario Party games would probably be Mario Party 2, 3, and 4. Try to get those. But you should still get this Mario Party."
2,The best Mario Party and still lousy,"Mario Party 7 may be the best Mario Party, but that doesn't matter because it still has lame gameplay, and lame graphics and sound. This is just the same old 95% luck-based virtual board game that all the other Mario Parties are. There's not much else to say, except that there should be no more Mario Parties. I rate this game 43/100."
1,HORRIBLE AND FRUSTANTING!!,"It's the worst ever, some of the game levels are very unfair and some of the orbs too. Yoshi orb steals all the orbs in his way, could be 7 or 8 at the time, but playing opposite to Yoshi you don't get anything like it. Very unfair, all the characters should have equal powerful orbs. If you have Mario Party 6, keep it, I'll be selling this one soon."
2,REHASH,"Mario Party Games give alot of fun to the kiddies. People who have played the other mario party games should not get this game. If you like it, buy it. Many of the minigames are stripped from the old ones giving new boards and more buttonmashing. Concept is the same."
5,"Great Game, Changed Alot But Great Overall!!!!!!!","This Game is an awesome game however I prefer Mario Party 6. But this Game is also good. It has changed a bit from 6. One of the boards in 7 (the windmill) is the best board on the game, you get to buy the windmill for however many coins and if you don't put up enough coins for that windmill someone else can buy the windmills for a higher price. It's awesome but still like 6 the best. I would say buy the game, great to add to your mario collection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Mini games are alittle harder but very fun!!!!!!!!"
3,Hope you didn't sell part 6,"Mario Party is a flagship franchise of Mario games. This game contains 86 mini-games that range from cell phone quality to console quality.Compared to Mario Party 6, it's terrible.The games are worse (not nearly as fun as part 6), the graphics are worse (to accommodate 8 players I think), the host is annoying both in sound and repeated interruption of the game (bring back the sun and the moon), Bowser will make you buy new controllers after frequently throwing yours at the screen (he is extremely unfair here), there is regular lag in between commencing dialogue and the game.The only thing better in this part are the Donkey Kong games.I knew I shouldn't have given away part 6 before buying this.On its own, this would be a 4 star game, but after playing 6, you know why desert is presented at the end of a meal, after part 6, 7 seems bland.Trilancer.blogspot.com"
3,Question about mic,I don't own this game but I have heard a lot of people talking about the mic feature. What exactly do you do with this mic?
5,Red Army meets Zen Modern,"written by obviously one of the region's foremost authorities on Chinese design and interiors having been in Hongkong with Elle Decor and other excellent publications for many years, Sharon Leece knows her way around the traditional feng shui and new leanings of the China elite as well as the western expat with a home and heart in Asia. Creative and informative text and fabulous photos take the reader on a trip into another world of China Decor uptil now unseen but sure to be come a trend worldwide. Check out her other China interior books for even more wonderful shots of lush and lavish spaces."
5,Dare the Devil,"One of the best games for the GBA. The control is great, and the action is unstoppable. Unlike THE SUM OF ALL FEARS it has the same style as the movie. The graphics, the light, the enemies, the dialogues, even the music( though it is not from the movie) will remind you that awesome film!And after the 23 levels are over, the fun isn't over! You have a lot of things to unlock( if you want to). I have finished this game once, and I have only unlocked half of those. Reminds SPIDER-MAN: THE MOVIE, huh? Only this is more difficult.So, even you hated the movie( I can't see how could anyone hate this movie, but anyway...), you'll enjoy it. What? You don't have it? Run like the wind right now, and buy it!!!"
2,"It was just too ""perfect""","I am a Christian and thought I would give some romantic fiction a try. I was dissapointed to say the least. The story was not bad, although predictable but the characters were just not fleshed out..not real. Everyone and everything was so cookie cutter perfect like the old sictoms from the 50's. Maybe in the world I came from I just could not relate. We as christians are flesh and bone with goodness and with FLAWS. I must say in Wick's defense I usually do not like fiction novels and her sentimentality was sweet but lacked realism in the characters"
2,Not her best effort,"I have read and own several Lori Wick books. I quite like ""Pretense"" which I have read and recommended several times. I love gardens and England so I've been anxious to start this series, which I luckily checked out from the library. This book was just bad. There was no character development. The 'Englishy' part was totally missing, I felt more like it was all happening in Vermont than in England, no local slang, no period accents. It was totally predictable. I've never written a bad review on amazon before, as I love to encourage authors and readers, but I was compelled to share today. No conflict. The scenes of horses involve no horse knowledge. The scenes of gardening involve no garden knowlege. Hardly any dialogue except arranging elaborate meetings and parties, that require no effort. I will not read any more in this series."
1,Lori Wick isn't Jane Austen,"Unfortunately for Lori Wick, her latest effort seems too much like a Jane Austen knockoff than a real Lori Wick novel. Everything from plot lines, places to charachter names is taken from an Austen novel. Reading ""The Propsal"" was like reading a modernised comgination of ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"", and sorry to say, Ms. Wick did not do either of them justice.The charachters are unbelieveable...enough of cliched children! The plot is predictable. I must say, a dissapointing effort from Lori Wick."
2,Okay--but not great,I really love Lori Wick's books and was expecting much more than this book gave. This is the only book of her's that I didn't love. I just couldn't get into it--it really wasn't all that interesting. But yet it wasn't so boring that I couldn't finish it.
2,The Proposal,Not one of the better books. It was rather predictable. But Book 2 was much better. I'm ordering book 3 now.
2,A mix of Jane Austen,"This is the second Lori Wick book I have read. I loved the first! This book was somewhat a disappointment because I felt like characters and situations were ripped right from the pages of Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice...The relationship between Marianne and Jennings mirrowed Darcy and Elizabeth...Marianne even twists her ankle (and thus meets Jennings). Jennings is a mix of Darcy and Edward Ferris, while Marianne is Elizabeth and Jane rolled into one. Lori Wick even used names straight from Jane Austen!Other than these similarities, I liked this book. It was slow at first, but soon picked up. I agree that the romance was rushed, but I don't think that it was the point of the story. I think Jennings conversion was the point...and this led to a romance.If you like Lori Wick you will like this too. It is a light and easy read and leaves you satisfied."
4,"Good, but not Great","After reading a few of the reviews for this book I was hesitant to pick it up, but in the end I'm glad I did. It wasn't as good as the rest of the series but I enjoyed it.Jennings has ""inherited"" three children and isn't quite sure how to handle it and has some trouble getting started. He decides that a trip to his estranged sister's home is in order.There he meets a woman who he thinks will be a wonderful mother for his children and tells her so, but Marianne won't consent to a marriage of convenience. When Jennings actually does fall for her, she won't believe his proposal genuine, so he sets out to prove her wrong.You can see Jennings slowly growing in his faith through-out the book, not one of her best, but still very enjoyable."
3,slow kind of boring,"The story and about Jennnings and Marianne really never seem to be romantic. The book lingered a lot on all the other problems then when you reach the last 7 chapter or so the story rush the romance, and the next thing you know they are married (Jennings and Marianne)"
1,could not finish,"I have only read this one of Lori Wick's books, but I must say I will never read another. I was horrified by the lack of originality. I never read the end of a book before I've read the whole thing, but in this case I already knew what was going to happen. The dialogue was weak, and in some cases painful to read. Ms. Wick also seemed to take all her character's names from Jane Austen. Having read many Austen novels, this greatly annoyed me. Maybe I've stumbled on an exception to her normally excellent writing, but I was wholly disappointed with this book."
2,Not Lori's Best...,"I do have to admit that this is certainly not my favorite series at all! Lori Wick does a good job of creating a small, close, and loving community within all of her books. But, recently I must admit that Lori Wick's book are not believable. They contain characters who are flawless and seem to all be Christian. But, this book is my least favorite of all of Lori's books."
4,Beautiful Life Application of Grace,"Lori Wick has a gift for weaving God's grace in her writing through examples of real people facing real issues. While reading other ""educational"" books on the subject of grace, I receive continued instruction as I enjoy the stories of her characters facing the same issues I face on a daily basis. Thank you Lori Wick for being used of God!"
2,A Disappointment,"Having read all of Lori Wick's books and looking for something new, I was extremely excited when I picked up a copy of ""The Proposal."" However, this book was a total disappointment. The characters were flat and the plot lines were predictable. I did not care at all for any of the characters, and I had to force myself through it. I hope Lori can do better in the remaining novels in the English Garden Series."
5,escape from reality,I love lori wick books and this was no different. Sure it wasn't realistic; for me that is the point. I read her books to escape reality for a while. Who doesn't love a fairytale? As for some of the harsher reviews...do they watch spy movies to learn about real life? I think not. Sometimes you just want something fun and different. Lori Wick does it for me everytime :)
5,GREAT LYRICS BREATHTAKING POEMS GREAT ILLUSTRATIONS,"Just before he sang ""Circle"" in concert, he usually played ""30,000 Lbs of Bananas."" On cue, the crowd greeted the songs with a hearty: ""Harry, it s---s!"" It wasn't true of that song, and it SURE isn't true with this book. The lyrics to some of Harry's songs make up a small part of the book (including the unreleased ""Pigeon Run""). His poems, written between the late 60's and mid '70s, range from funny to scary to darkly beautiful. A must-have for any Chapin fan. But, ""keep the change,"" and find it at: harrysfriends.com/hcf (they also sell lots of collectibles, all proceeds going to the foundation created in his memory. This book, at ten bucks each (a fraction of the usual internet price)--will enable you to get copies for yourself and all the other Chapin fans amongst your family and friends. ONWARDS AND UPWARDS!"
5,Timeless.....Fantastic...A Classic,"Harry Chapin may be gone but his talent lives on in both his music and his poetry. I grew up listining to Harry with my parents and recently recieved his poetry from another devoted fan my, aunt. This book is Harry at his best! The book serves as a source of inspiration and enlightenment. It is a must have if you can get your hands on it."
3,Almost a great bag for my 055X,"The Manfrotto 055XPROB Tripod is s professional level, well designed tripod. It is not light at 7 pounds and is intended for studio and moderate travel. For hiking long distances, I would recommend a carbon fiber model.Why discuss the tripod when reviewing a bag? Because the tripod is supposed to fit in the bag. It doesn't. It is about 1/2"" too long. That means that in order to get the 055X into the AW 32798 bag, you have to put the ball head end into the bag first, diagonally, and then one by one force the leg tips into the other end of the bag. In other words, it is the zipper length that isn't quite right for the tripod.No worry though, you get used to the aggravation and packing the tripod into the bag becomes a routine. It seems that over time, the tripod is stretching the bag slightly and that maybe after a couple year's use it will fit properly. Manfrotto, if you have fixed this problem and want to send me a replacement, please contact me."
4,Great for most tripods or monopods!,"Great Bogan/Manfrotto quality. This does the job. I have two of them, one for a mono pod and one for a video/DSLR. The small pocket on the side is large enough to hold spare mounting plates or small ball head but you won't fit a fluid video head in the pouch. Other than that it's perfect for everyday use. Keeps my tripods in great shape while lugging them around in the car."
1,Too Small forthe 055XPROB with Head attached,"Got this bag along with the 055XPROB & the 322RC2 Joystick Head. The legs will barely fit in the bag without the head. With the head forget it. So if you want to carry your tripod with any type of head on it this is not the bag, you'll need something longer. Now as far as the bag, it is built very nicely. I would love the bag if it were six inches longer. I gave one star because the bags description says its for the 055X series tripods."
2,PLEASE READ - Bag Opening Too Small,"I too have purchased the Manfrotto 055XPROB Pro Tripod Legs (Black). It DOES NOT fit into this case. If I stretch and fight the tripod, I can get it in the case. The case itself is a great case. The tripod that is SUPPOSED to fit in case does not fit. The case opening is about 1/2 to 1"" too small. Do not buy if you have the 055XPROB.I normally read reviews for products, but somehow this got by me. . . too bad for me."
1,Not for the Manfrotto 055CXPRO3 tripod,"I purchased this as part of a 3 item selection. IT DOES NOT FIT THE 055CXPR03. It is not even close. I wonder if I received the correct bag as thier is no lable to indicate it was made by or for Manfrotto. I would return it if not for the fact that I did not try it before I traveled to Hawaii. Once I umpacked everything I found out it wasen't even close to the correct dimensions. I tossed it over the Hotel Balcony and before I could recover it, someone had made off with it."
4,dope !!!,this is one of the most abstract cd's that iv'e ever heard pick this one up my favorite track is bermuda shorts and nightmare...
1,a question,"I haven't purchased this item. Is it weather proof? Someone mentioned that it is quite heavy so I would like to leave it at our cookout area permanently. Would the weather harm it in any way? Also, how is it cleaned? Can you use regular detergent or does it require something special?"
5,Great for picnics too,we bought this cart for placing next to our grill for holding food -- don't use it for pottingworks great
3,Not So Good,"Enjoyed the product immensely, but it broke apart too quickly and was too cumbersome to use afterwards as it was in pieces."
5,What a find!,"We have been looking for this book for at least 5 years. We have a jewelry shop that specializes in Navajo, Zuni and Hopi Indian jewelry. This book is the best in showing where different turquoise comes from and how to identify it. We use this reference book as a means to identify turquoise and give our customers information. It is especially important now that turquoise is a very sought after commidity. I highly reccomend this book for it's usefullness at The Biggest Little Shop in Helen."
3,"Does the job, just not that well...","I needed to extend my shower head up about 9 inches so I could stand up straight in the shower. This fit the bill. BUT it does leak a little at the base. I've tried plumbers tape but it still has a slow drip when the shower is on.One other flaw is that the arm is not adjustable once screwed in. This means that when I tighten the product all the way (to help with the drip), the arm is at an angle. So the extension is not going up vertically but rather at about a 10% angle toward the right. This isn't a big deal but I do loose some height and it looks wonky."
4,This shower arm extender is ok,"I get plenty of water from this shower arm - I use a regular showerhead, which only allows a certain amount of water through, so the pipe size is fine for me. This moves and tightens at both ends, so you can get the exact angle you want - avoid over tightening though. I think this unit is best for setting to 1 permanent position only, in my opinion. I don't like showering so close to the front part of the tub and I use a shower filter, so this helps me with this situation. I put a flow control on first, then the shower filter, then the arm extender, and then the showerhead. I somewhat wish the wrench wasn't a separate piece, but it's not that big of a deal, since I set it in one position and leave it. However, if the wrench was bolted on the unit, perhaps it would get in the way of things. The Danze D481150 is another shower arm extender you might want to consider (I don't know if it's better). The Whedon SRW1C works for me and I've been using this for about 4 years."
3,OK but not very adjustable,"This swing arm attachment is OK for the price, but without a separate rotating flange to connect to the wall pipe, the unit cannot be rotated into the correct orientation to provide vertical adjustments. I fixed mine somewhat by adding extra washers, but it is jerry-rigged at best and I am looking for a better solution elsewhere."
4,shower arm extender,Bought a rain showerhead and needed this to extend to aim showerhead to center of stall. Awesome that it fits perfectly on purchased showerhead. Had to adjust it only twice to tighten screw to keep it in place. No other problems afterwards. Stylish and cool looking!
5,Just announced,"This book has just won the 2003 Maine Lupine Award. The annual award was named in honor of Barbara Cooney's ""Miss Rumphius""."
1,What is this??,"I have Trilogy pt. 2 and 3, so I decided to pick up the pt. 1. BIG MISTAKE! I expected to hear what I heard on the last two in the series, good prog metal concept album, but I got Charlie Dominici playing acoustic guitar while singing and without any other instruments. This might be the biggest disappointment I've had with buying before listening. I can't believe a record company would release this. It sounds like a rough group of ideas laid down in a home studio so the rest of the band can come in and learn thier parts before actually recording. Waist of time in my opinion."
1,very surprised,I had heard many cuts from trilogy part two and like them well. This cd is vocal and acoustic guitar only. Not what I am interested in.
4,catchy!!!,"This is the opening theme to the anime Genshiken, which is all about the lives of otaku (people obsessed with anime, video games, manga, etc.). The anime is great, and this theme song is also very good. It fits well with the series, and becomes very catchy. We watched it in our anime club, and by the third episode, we were singing along with the ""ai ai ai"". I even have the lyrics as an away message on AIM."
4,Very decent introduction of Cg,"This is a very decent introduction to Cg and shaders in general. It starts off by describing the programable pipeline, and then introduces the shaders. The chapters describe how shaders can be developed for most of the common stuff in real-time graphics. But the best aspect of this book is that it does not cater just to the cutting edge(cineFX/DX9) but also demonstrates how the shader can be developed for a baseline hardware system. Performance and cineFX tips are sprinkled throughout the book along with a collected Cg reference section.Overall a very good way to start learning Cg and real-time programming using shaders."
5,excellent guide to using cg,"As the owner of a game company, books like this are a valuable asset in getting our developers who aren't familiar with CG up to speed on the subject.This book is highly recommended by our development staff, and our developers went out an purchased their own personal copies of the book even though we have it in our office library."
1,"It's OK, but there is a better book on Mt. Lowe Railway",I think Mount Lowe Railway by Michael A. Patris is much more informative and a better history of the railway.
5,A Wonderful Portal to the Past,"Like Mr. Klein, I too grew up in Southern California and am familiar with the many locations, in their present incarnation, in which this wonderful story takes place. The book raised a curtain on the past and allowed me to step into the Southern California where my grandparents stepped off the train from Boston, full of excitement and anxious to make a new life in this promising paradise at the edge of America.Even if you are not a native Californian, you'll enjoy this book which, in addition to the well researched historical insight, is a great yarn.Well done Mr. Klein and thank you!"
4,Surprisingly good,Very entertaining (and explicit) lyrics with surprisingly good rockabilly style music.
3,Jayne's Last Movie,"Movie was released after Ms. Mansfield's death in 1968. Jayne's last husband Matt Cimber directs the movie. Jayne looks young in the opening scene as a young girl who is soon deserted by her husband. Then, she darkens her hair and becomes pregnant and later one assumes she aborts the baby. Then, we are left with a boring segment about a late middle-aged couple who are trying to date. Movie was not completed when Jayne died, so I guess this was thrown in to piece movie together, boring. Lastly, we see Jayne as a mentally unbalanced prostitute who drives another unbalanced guy to suicide. Favorite line by Jayne in movie ""Monkey"" Even though, this is a low budget movie, it is a great final movie of Jayne's. I would give movie more stars if it had better quality of co-stars and better budget."
1,WARNING: Mansfiled is HARDLY IN this movie!,"I bought this movie because of the description. I thought it would be a tale of an envious neighbor who is jealous of idol Jayne Mansfield. A fun, yummy script full of wit and fashion. Someone had said it is what ""Single White Female"" had been based on. NOT EVEN!What I found was you need an attention span longer than the great wall of china if you want to have a chance at enjoying this movie. That and you shouldn't be a fan of Mansfield, since she is hardly IN IT! The only good scene is the end, and then surprisingly, just when it gets half-good, it stops. It ends.In one word: BORINGIn one phrase: The description (on the cover) is OVERRATED."
1,Disoppointed with the quality of citizen...,"I gave this watch to my wife has her birthday present. She loved the watch, it was a lovely looking watch... but within a day she came back complaining that the face of the watch has scratches. According to the description the dial windows was suppose to me mineral, which means minimum scratches. But these scratches were deep and visible.I have bought about three Citizen watches from either Macys/JC Penny.. after using them for years, I never had a problem with them, nor scratches... When I was looking for a new watch for my wife, I found this watch and felt the price was great... but now I am disappointed with the quality...I returned it to Amazon.com, they returned the money.. I was not charged for return shipping.... I love their customer support."
3,Work great but are a little pricey,"Mounted them in the shop immediately and got my boxes of gloves off the work bench. Will hold all sizes. Would have been 5 stars except for prce. A little expensive for what they are, but I would buy them again/"
4,A Solid Film...with an occasional expected slump.,"I really liked this video but I feel that it isn't exactly what you might anticipate in rap related cinema. It runs a little slow and some parts are sort of annoying (seeing Puff's b@*** a&&) but offers highlights. Seeing hip hop stars pop in, comical aspects, introspective views into his foundings and future (record label, clothing line: PHAT FARM, accessories ETC.). Also includes a ""built in"" sampling of his record's music as he cruises on the street or by foot. I rented this at Hollywood Video, and I recommend you peep it beforehand. I also rec. RHYME & REASON as the greatest rap/hip hop documentry ever.One."
5,Easy on the Bunghole!,"This is the finest toilet paper known to man. It is strong yet soft; smooth yet not overly moist. Buy a pack of this stuff, and you'll never go back to ""regular"" TPs. (And don't confuse this with Cottonelle's ""Aloe & E"" -- Charmin Plus is far, far superior.)"
5,Pocket-part for main volume,The American Indian Law Deskbook is a great resource since it is updated annually via these cumulative pocket parts. (Read more in my review of the main volume.)
1,A REAL STINKER!!,"The reviewers got it right - this blows!Could not even finish it. Won't buy the next one upcoming. Not if it is the same writer.The Goodwin reviewer's said it best. Decent enough beginning, but then descends into a quagmire of crap quickly afterwards.Can't wait until ANY of the other writers get back to this series."
3,Good ideas to help use your brain,"This work is packed with ideas on how to use your brain more effectively, and to fight the slowing down which some of us may eventually face. Not an easy read, and I certainly took a while to get it finished. But worth the effort."
4,Great but be careful,"I like the excercises and all, but I am very wary of the new age stuff (meditation, etc). Beware of the wiles of lucifer!"
5,Awesome!~,This book was a great read and the illustrations were spectacular! Will be giving this as gifts for sure!
1,The Bad Book,"The book is about a serpent that came to Gloucester. Everybody is really scared and they're trying to hunt it down. When they were fishing they thought they saw it but they actually got a huge humongous trout. In the end it leaves and everybody is really sad because they liked seeing it jump around and have fun. It's the worst book in the whole world because it repeats all of the same words like sea and gloomy and dark, icy, terrible, and serpent. It won the Southerland awards and I didn't want it to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My whole class wanted for Leonardo the Terrible Monster to win, and it didn't, so the day wasn't too fun and a lot of other classes were bragging because they had all voted for The Serpent Came to Gloucester."
5,Good read. Helpful,I thought this was a very well written book. Gives lots of ideas to try with your colicky infant. The best thing to come acros with thi book is that you are not alone!!!! And colic will go away :)
3,"Good information, but there is a real cure for colic","This book covers the basic methods of The Happiest Baby on the Block. It is good stuff, but not a cure for colic.There is a real, research proven cure for colic. It is explained by Taubman in Why is My Baby Crying? There have been 3 research studies on this method. 2 were by Taubman, and one was by a masters nursing student in Texas. All 3 studies shows that there is a cure for colic."
3,BB guns only,"Strictly for BB guns. Works great for that - when the bottom disc is shattered, the next one slides right in to place, until it's empty. Just don;t use you .22 on it though, unless you can garantee to hit only the disc. A .22 will go right through the plastic case and mess up the tracks the replacement disc slides down on."
1,Junk,I got this for my son to use with his bb gun. It is a very low power 2nd gen Red Ryder (it was mine when I was young) and after a few hours of shooting from 60 feet away the plastic holding the feet had completely broken off. Oh well. $2 worth of fun for $10.
5,Bravo Sobonfu!,"When I read ""Spirit of the Intimacy"" I was really amazed. Such a wisdom, so vibrant... such an ancient knowledge. Ideas totally new for me, but I could feel the Truth in them.The Dagara village, that place so special... that wonderful community.I was fortunate of learning about these things.I can understand that so many people put so much expectations on you.Then, the fall. After all you are a human being, no more no less.That is why I bow at you. At the great bravery behind your sincerity.No pretend to be what others would like you to be, just sincerity, just humanity.That is wisdom also.Thanks for your book"
5,Wrong part,"I'm sure this is a great product, but it was the wrong gasket for my car. Better luck next time."
5,The end of the end starts here.,"Within this edition their will be turmoil, their will drama, their will be justice, their will be sadness, their will be Evangelion. To review this edition is difficult since most most people either grasp the entirety of the turmoil and emotion involved, or they don't at all. All that can be said, or should be said, is that if you have watched the series this far, don't stop.It only gets better."
1,Can't stand it,"The animation and concept in this DVD are decent, but it was just too boring. There seemed to be very little action in it. It was depressing and slow. I thought ADV would do better than this. If you want to see REAL animation, view one of the following films...-Akira-Ghost in the Shell-Princess Mononoke"
4,Already included,"I made the mistake of thinking I was gyped out of some of the episodes when I bought the Platinum Collection boxed set (which has ""Collection"" disks 1-6). So I bought Platinum Collection 7 thinking I would now have the director's cuts of some more episodes, but it turns out the boxed set just consolidates Collection disks 1-7 into 6 disks. Amazon.com let me return it, but I had to pay for shipping. Oh well, lesson learned. I thought you all might learn from my mistake."
3,short changed on Platinum Collection 7,"This is not a review, just a comment on Neon Genesis Evangelion - Platinum Collection 7. It does not contain the director cut for episodes 25 and 26."
2,One of the lousier bits of Evangelion,"Ok, let me start off my saying that I am in no way an Eva expet, and I've only seen the first 10 or so episodes up until this DVD. There was a lot of flashbacks, if u like that sort of thing, a lot of sitting around and talking, and almost no action. Not up to the series' standards, I thought. The DVD is great as usual, though. Good sound, good video, good menus, good overall. The acutal content just got boring. I found myself skipping though minute-long scenes of two characters just sitting around, not even saying anything. Hope DVD 8 is better than this."
3,Good music,I enjoyed this CD. I actually purchased it for the wife but I have enjoyed it. It reminds me of Alanis mixed with some fiona apple.
1,"More Jim Beam, please....","I don't have any good reason why I bought this cd.Driving to work, I heard the one decent song, ""Officer"" on the local college station and ordered the cd. And, as a new folk/alt. country fan, I shudda known better.I tried, but after one listen and a reprise of ""Officer"", I just wanna go to the likker store, buy a pint o' Jim Beam, grab the nearest John Hiatt disc, lock it on repeat and practice cleaning my revolver.Until I get it right."
5,priceless for fans,"I am extremly happy that I found this VHS tape, not only because I was looking for more episodes, but it also has the first two episodes of the series. If you're looking for the beginning of this series, buy this, you will enjoy it."
4,Jefferson,"Great to read some about a president who was a thinker and had the right ideas about our country. The politicians back then were people who actually cared about our country and the long-term stabiltiy of it instead of what was in it for them! They were smart enough to know what was good for the country would be good for them instead of getting what was good for them at the expense of the country. If some of our current politicians were alive back then, they would have been wearing red coats."
2,Not great. Mildly informative.,Contained some basic facts. Too much info about Adams as if the author was lacking the content to write the biography. No real interesting stories you would not see in any of the bios written by other authors. Some of the olde English words aren't in either of dictionaries included with the Kindle. Price: Free (five stars for price).[Review submitted through my Kindle. I love this thing!]
2,Not so great.,"This was an OK story, but like Cheri, I took umbrage at the ridiculous statement about breastfeeding. If Sonora were really so intelligent, she would have continued to breastfeed, knowing that it was the healthiest food for her. Silly, I know to have something like that spoil a book for you, but there you have it. A statement like that can leave a lasting impression on a young mind, so you have fair warning, parents. (By the way, I usually like Gail Carson Levine's stories a lot.)"
1,Horrible,"Nothing like teaching kids as early as possible that breastfeeding is ""barbaric"" and ""cannibalism"". I am truly disgusted that children are reading this nonsense. Shame on you, Ms. Levine!"
3,Maybe 3 1/2!,"The book started out a little slow then it was a roller coaster, up and down, for awhile and the last 100 pages really picked up for me but I feel it feel apart near the end. I wasn't that entertained and feel that Piccirilli's other works are much better then this.If ANYONE who has read A choir of Ill Children is reading this review than they should know what I'm talking about. For half the book i really didn't get that great a feel for the character. It's not a bad book just not his best. I still think he is horror's answer to Faulkner, but his talent goes beyond this book."
4,A terrifying vision...,"I'll admit it. I've been afraid to read Tom Piccirrilli. Whenever you pick up his books you see blurbs with quotes like 'literate sensibility', 'lyrical voice', or 'a powerful meditation on isolation'. Eek! I like my horror to be scary, fast, furious, and above all readable! I read for entertainment - not just edification.But, I took the plunge and I'm glad I did.November Mourns is extremely readable and entertaining. It throws you into a backwoods horrorland and doesn't let go until the very last page.The main character, Shad Jenkins, is a dark reluctant hero and is so well developed that you share his every sorrow and triumph.This is a great book for any fan of horror and it doesn't disappoint. Ignore all the highbrow blurbs and just sit back and enjoy a dark, spooky tale!"
2,Key pieces missing,"I book this WROX book sight unseen, but after having read these reviews and owning many other WROX books. The immediate trigger for buying was having some of my Excel 2003 macros stop working in Excel 2007 due to the change in color scheme. This book is silent on the new color scheme. On the other hand, ""Excel 2007 Power Programming with VBA (Mr. Spreadsheet's Bookshelf)"" deals with this issue in depth, so I bought this reference also, and would recommend it over the WROX book. Mr Spreadsheet's book has saved my bacon.The WROX book doesn't handle the translation of Excel 2003 ""lists"" to Excel 2007 ""tables"" completely. I would have liked more info on Structured References, which have the potential to make ""tables"" actually useful."
3,Bone Rain Drain Down Spout,This item was used on our down spouts and worked fine in spring summer and fall but in winter water froze in it and then would not drain.
2,Cheap,This is not very well made and does not work like it should. It takes a torrential downpour for it to work properly.
1,Sucks,"Not worth talking about. Doesn't work, and it's ugly. Although, it did make a good chew toy for my dog for a few minutes."
1,"For 2 bucks used, ok. For 20 new never","While I do not know ""A Customer"" I must agree with him. Thing is that if you are going to cherry pick, there should at least be cherries in the bowel. Always the driver, never the chauffer. Take it from one who knows, this is no ""Class Act"". In order to get along, you go along. Those who take this as gospel should buy thier pacifiers also as they check out."
2,Can't pick and choose the facts you use.,"I was involved with Rudy and Frank for part of the research for the book. I aranged for Rudy to be bailed out of jail after being arested in Miami as a matter of fact he ended marrying his bondswoman. Funny how much of the ""facts"" Rudy had me check out that didn't quite add up never made the book. Anyway, Rudy used me as I imagine he used many of the Tyson-King clan and he got left out. Too bad, my heart is broken for him. As far as I'm concerned he deserved what he got. He is a user in my opinion."
4,great product,"Based on good reviews, I decided to try this product. Very impressive. This product is exceptionally good for an oil. It does go on dry on your skin if you apply right after the shower. It does not feel greasy at all like baby oil after applying. The fragrance can be a little overpowering when you first apply it (that explains 4 stars),but not to worry, the smell evaporates after 10 minutes or so. You could apply little bit of it to hair too..makes my hair shiney. Overall..would recommend this product."
3,Good product,"Although this is a nice oil with a very nice smell, baby oil does the same exact thing and cost a lotttt less than this product."
5,Great product,Fits well and holds up under rugged use. I'll being buying another as soon as this one starts to wear.
1,junk,as in the other belt made by this company go to your local farm store and buy one they cost more but will last more than 2 days or a single season
2,Classic hike book,"This is not so great; there were important trails missing, such as Black canyon trail, high desert trail, badger spring trail, all missing.Isaac"
3,"Nice design, poor photo selection","This guide looks great. In addition to short descriptions, each hike has a color topo map, elevation profile and color pictures. However, the closer I reviewed the guide, the more frustrated I became with the photos. Some are very informative, capturing a highlight along the trail or overview of the area. But some of the pictures are worthless to me as I try to get a feel for the trail or scenery. For two different hikes the only picture is a close up of pine needles and several others show fallen logs, leaves, etc that could have been taken in someone's backyard. Four hikes in a row show pictures of cacti. Seeing all this different plant life is something I enjoy, but I think it could have been included in the ""Flora & Fauna"" section with more informative pictures included with each hike."
4,See all the Desert has to Offer,"From Arizona's gorges, to desert terrain, to streambeds and more...this book has pics and descriptives of them all. If you want to experience Arizona's plant life and varied terrains, then set out on a course of your choice and take along this book to enjoy it to the fullest."
3,Grandson loved it,Ordered this movie that I could not find around where I live. My grandson got it for his birthday and loves the movie. Good choice.
5,Awesome,My nephew loved the DVD. i will b buying more from this person. it came in at the riight time and it was brand new never opened.
2,mediocre,"The mixer is designed to be ergonomic, but I found that it was so heavy that my hand and wrist got sore after only a few minutes. Also, the 5 speeds are fast, faster, really fast, speed of light, and warp speed. In fact, I didn't even test the highest speed because I thought the mixer would take off! The lack of a low or medium speed presented a problem when mixing dry ingredients into wet.I wouldn't buy this mixer again or recommend it to anyone."
5,A great mixer!,"I own this mixer and LOVE it. I use it for making very stiff biscotti dough, a task that is beyond all the other more expensive mixers I have now put away in my cupboard! I rarely use my expensive stand mixer anymore, since this works just as well, and requires a lot less cleaning. There are just two drawbacks. It's top-heavy, so be careful when you put it down, since it tips over easily. I have knocked it over numerous times, and it still works fine. The beaters are not very sturdy, so if you plan to use it a lot buy a few extra. I wish I bought this one before I wasted my money on those more expensive hand mixers. No, I don't work for Black & Decker. I just love their mixer."
4,the rewiew,This book is over 300 pages and has a lot of diagrams. The diadvantage of the book is it is very complicated to learn and the movements take a lot i mean alot of time to do. i have not seen a book with that much information and exercises.if you are new to dim-mak chances are when you see the blocks and stance of dimmak you would quit. Howewer the advantage is it does have chapters on very basic self defence easy to learn moves and does show you how to ko a person and how to revive them in more than ten ways. If your searching for a book on deadly strikes this is the book to buy and yes the moves do work. so deadly that you would have to think thrice before using them and in a physical fight chances are you would not use such effective moves AUTOMATICLY if you dont practice everyday it does also explain on how the moves work and includes also the st.9 point
2,Old and outdated,This book really has not much information at all. Pictures are so old looking and is not informative especially for new collectors. I would not purchase again.
4,A surprisingly good read!,"This is not my type of book...I'm more of a mystery thriller type of fan. But a friend recommended this book, and after a couple of chapters, I was hooked. This was a good story about growing up in the deep south, and never giving up, no matter what nature throws at you. Tobias and Emma started it all, and with good hearts and open minds, raised a family in the scrub. There were difficult times, but the family was strong and persevered. Tobias' son Zechariah had the foresight to purchase thousands of acres of land that became more valuable as time wore on. Unfortunately, with time also comes progress, and good ole days that are gone forever. As a friend recommended this to me, I now recommend it to you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
5,Fabulous. Every Jew should consider reading this work.,"Dr./Rabbi Antelman presents in a very easy read the history behind the various schisms in Judaism, when they happened, for what reason and by whom. ""To Eliminate the Opiate"" is the ""From Time Immemorial"" of untold Jewish History.It is my opinion that when the normal, unknowledged and even the well versed Jew reads these volumes they will begin to ask themselves ""Is this true?"" The reason why they will ask this is due to their faith's obvious schism which now honors all the abominations and digressions that their religion and their Bible deem as ""evil"", ""immoral"" or pure corruptions.This is a very good book for both Jews and Non-Jews alike to truly understand Jews, Judaism and the various anti-Semitic claims that the ignorant place over these people. Fabulous to say the very least. 5/5."
5,Great Basic Information About House Church,"Robert and Julia shared from experience when they wrote this book. It is so refreshing to read a book that is about real life, rather than just the theory and doctrine of how house church ought to be. The various testimonies are really insightful.If you are contemplating leaving the institutionalized church, this book would be a good place to start your journey toward relational fellowship in the home setting."
5,candid and honest,"Finally, a book for actors written by an actress turned psychologist who's both empathetic and logical!"
2,Reading for class but definitely not for pleasure,"As I read most of the chapters in the book, I realized how boring the content was. I only bought the book because a class required it. This book is not recommended for leisure reading unless you Really, Really like Greek myths. The translation is probably good but direct translation from the original does not mean eloquent English to read. The reading is stiff."
2,Excessively Salty,"Crisp chips had excess salt. If you are looking to shoot your blood pressure to the moon, these chips will do it. Otherwise, they have a nice, spicey flavor. Cannot reorder because of the high salt content."
2,As bulbs fine but packaging is not so swell,"One shattered and one intact but not working so the Amazon price advantage disappeared. Other than that, they're light bulbs."
3,45 out of 48,"I had ordered 48, 3 were broken or didn't work. Not worth returning - just glad to get these bulbs."
3,Just so-so.,"A couple of broken ones on arrival, and they don't last very long; not worth it. You'll do better getting them from the grocery store as you need them - or stocking up at Home Depot, if you don't mind the storage space they'll need."
2,can't walk in them and shoes fell apart.,"i have 5-inch platform high-heel boots that are stable and look great ... and i have THESE things that wobble and look clownish rather than wicked.the point on the toe is too long, looking clownish/awkward rather than wicked. and they are a bit wide. So if you get them, get them a 1/2 size smaller than you'd usually get.and i danced in them for a single night, and the plastic black thing on the point on the high heel got worn down to an angle such that they don't stand up streight anymore and i'm not sure i can wear them again.they are uncomfortable (compared to other wicked high-heel boots), they don't look good (they look awkward/clownish) and they fall apart after a single use.no more ellie shoes for me. i got shoes from spike angel. they cost the same and look much better, and are actually more comfortable than some flats i own."
4,Fitness Emergency,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this tape when I received it because I'm not really into videos with super complex choreography. But I was pleasantly surprised when I gave this video a try. I liked the balanced blend of dancy and athletic style moves. The dance moves are do-able. I especially loved doing the hippy marches and shoulder shimmies! Minna is a great instructor. She's not chatty (which is a huge plus for me!), yet motivationg and fun. My heart rate stayed up during the toning section also because the upper and lower body are worked simultaneously. My only gripe is that the toning section in this video doesn't really work my muscles to fatigue because it goes by so quickly. However, I do get a nice hour long workout when I do the whole tape and I'm drenched with sweat when it's over.So for those advanced beginners/intermediates seeking a video with simple choreography to challenge you and spice up your rotation every now and then, purchase Emergency Workout."
4,editing nightmare,"This video is a great workout no doubt about it, but until you have it memorized be prepared for miscues due to poor editing. The fact that they shoot the upper half of Minna's ""back-up dancers"" when Minna is cueing the legs is really frustrating. Once in the toning section they even cut to one of the back-ups doing an excersize off cue which messes me up everytime. Other than that the video offers two great sections for toning and aerobics, and Minna has a great personality that makes you want to stick with it."
2,Horrible!,"As an intermediate exerciser, there is no workout here! The only reason Minna has a little sweat on her at the end is because of all the jumping jacks she does. The aerobic workout does NOT even have a beginning stretch. I was so bored I couldn't wait for it to be over the first time around."
2,Annoying Cardio Segment,"The first 30 minutes is a salsa inspired cardio segment that was choreographed so poorly that I was actually embarrassed to see myself do it! There is way too much hip swinging and general grooving for a rhythm challenged exerciser like myself. I like my moves a little more athletic, and preferably ones that actually will break me out in a sweat!!The toning segment, on the other hand, was interesting and a little more challenging. If you do a different cardio tape, then switch to the toning segment on this one, you would be a lot better off. It's a good thing I really don't have anything I need to get in shape for in 6 weeks, or using this dvd I would be doomed!"
1,"DANCEY - mambo, chacha","I have Minna's Optimizer Blend, and I love it! So I bought this one thinking it would be as good. Its AWFUL! You need to know how to do the Mambo and Chacha, there's poor camera coverage, and no instruction on how to do these dances... I HATED IT! It went about 90mph too so I couldn't pick up the moves AT ALL! Try Minna's Blend, but FORGET THIS ONE!"
4,Definatly a workout!,"Being a beginner, I found it very hard to keep up and get co-ordinated enough to follow her. After a few days and endless rewinding of the tape, I have started to get the hang of it. It is an intense work-out but you NEED to have co-ordination along wit the pause button close by."
5,Excellent workouts,"I already had Minna's Fat Eliminator and Strength and Grace, and I loved them both for different reasons, but they were not exactly what I was looking for. I decided to get the Emergency Workout and I am so glad I did!! For one thing, the time FLIES by because she really keeps you moving and both workouts are actually fun. The Cardio and Toning workouts are 30 minutes each, so you feel the burn and work hard, but they are not too long and not too short. The music is good, and Minna and the girls look like they are having fun, too. I highly recommend this DVD, and not only to people who need to lose weight in a certain period of time. It is good for anybody under any circumstances."
2,Salsa or Exercise?,"I didn't buy this video with the intention of learning the salsa, I got it to excercise!!! I love Minna's other videos, but this one is too much dancing and not enough of just exercising. I have been doing aerobics for years and I had a hard time with this one!!! They should call it a dance video."
2,"Way Too ""Dancy""!","I was hoping for an exercize routine I could really use, but this is so dancy and complicated that it's tough to follow. I enjoy aerobics in general, but there are so many ""shoulder shimmies"" and ""hip circles"" in this video, it makes me wonder if it was created for entertainment purposes rather than to give us a workout. If you need a good workout that you can realistically follow, consider something else."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this video as something to throw in with my regular routine so I wouldn't get stuck in a plateau from not enough variation. Unfortunately, the routines were confusing and difficult to follow. It also consisted of a lot of standing in one place and shimmying your body as opposed to really getting a workout by moving. I was very disappointed, especially after reading all the other great reviews. 10 minutes into the workout I turned it off because my heart rate wasn't what I wanted for a cardio workout. I would not suggest this as a good workout even for a beginner."
4,Minna Emergency Workout,"Minna is a good instructor-trainer. This DVD has two main workouts that are about 25 minutes. She has a cardio and a dance routine. Some days I combine both for a full workout. In the cardio, she combines weights with toning. Minna is real focused and makes sure your form in each exercise is correct."
5,get the tape!,"I got this tape after I became pregnant and could no longer comfortably jog and bike. Let me tell you, as essentially an exercise fanantic, it's good. Most tapes I'd tried were way too easy, and I thought this would be no exception. In fact I bought it so it wouldn't be super hard, but would keep me active during my pregnancy. It's really sneaky -- you think you're getting a light workout but actually it's kicking your [rear]! After my baby was born ( a healthy boy) I found my muscles had better tone and I was six pounds lighter than before my pregnancy -- and I did not diet, and I did not exercise as much as I did before. Get this tape it's deceivingly low key, but very effective."
5,The best one yet!,"I have bought so many different exercise videos/dvds and seem to find this one is the one for me. Like others have said, it is challenging enough but not over the top. I definatly find myself feeling like I have accomplished a good exercise routine every morning. My kids love to watch me doing it too, usually they tug at me and beg me to get them this and that but since I got this dvd they just sit and watch. The first couple of times I did the exercises it was a little confusing but fun enough to try again the next day, now that 2 weeks have gone by I seem to be in tune with it all and enjoying it just as much as the first time. Give it a try!"
2,Not Good,"I bought the VHS tape of this one back in 2003 right at my 2nd pregnancy. I decided to try it after the baby. We'll I did and it's probably good for losing baby weight. However, if you are an avid workout individual, I would not suggest wasting your money. It took awhile getting used to the choregraphy (felt like I was in a video). The producers could have done better."
2,not what I expected,"I generally like Minna's videos, and I looked forward to this. The dance moves are very very complicated, even for me, and I am advanced! The SALSA and the CHA CHA's are thrown in to an already too complicated video. I never even got to the second 30 minutes because I was so disappointed with the first half. Luckily, I bought it at another store and I can return it b/c I don't like it. You can't do that with online shopping."
5,Haunting and Lovely,"The title story--about a dog nailed to a cross outside a church, presumably to discourage its members--is one of the most haunting and graceful stories I've read in years. But what I like most about this collection is how the author depicts the Southern Pentecostal experience, without irony or prejudice, to produce a deeply engrossing collection of stories in which sum of its parts is somehow more than the individual pieces.Gwyn is one of the true descendents of Flannery O'Connor, with a little Larry Brown and Eudora Welty thrown into the mix. If you ever read with awe one of Flannery O'Connor's stories--such as ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find"" or ""Good Country People""--you will not be disappointed in the least with Dog on the Cross."
5,Does what it's suposed to,I bought this for my brother-in-law for his birthday. He seems very happy with it.
5,Love it!,"Love this book! My daughter got it for Christmas she is 2 1/2, this is a GREAT book! A must buy!"
4,Sweet book,Sweet little book. I recommend it.Has several verses using the Jesus Loves Me tune.My grandaughter likes it really well.
5,Jesus loves Me,This book fulfilled a need to find a book to give to one year olds on the first anniversary of their baptism. It is a lovely book that parents can sing with their child to show God's love.
3,It's Alright,"I think this is a nice book - however I wasn't aware that the entire book is written to be sang in tune to ""Jesus loves me""."
1,Don't Bother,"I got this book for free which I thought wouldn't be bad since I wasn't paying anything for it. However, it was so terrible and difficult to navigate through that even the act of deleting it off my kindle felt like too much."
3,Suncast deck boxes,"Great boxes, thought they would have a waterproof seal but didn't. They are a great size, held all of our outdoor toys."
5,Meets expectations,"Pros:We purchased this deck box to store some outdoor furniture on the patio. It's not gorgeous, but it does the job nicely. Furniture stays dry in the rain. The box was easily assembled and is just as described.Cons: There was slight cosmetic damage in shipping, but we did not choose to return the item because it didn't matter to us.We would recommend this item."
2,Broken,SUPER FAST SHIPPING BUT !!!! tabs on one side are broken off. I will try to assemble as is maybe somehow patch it wasn't worth the 45.00 off for this. Always take a chance when u buy on line.
2,"Assembly instructions, please!","Received this product without any assembly instructions. I assume it snaps together, but having a hard time figuring out what goes where."
5,Wonderful outdoor toy box!!,I bought this deck box as an outside toybox for my 3 year old son. It was easy to put together. Lightweight enough to move on my deck and easy for my son to get toys in and out of. Very happy...
4,strong enough to sit on,"Although the deck box was not large enough to store my chair cushions - which is what I bought it for - I have kept it. It is strong, sturdy and water tight - so I use it to store my pool chemicals and other odds & ends on my deck. It has even served as a seat a couple of times."
1,Missing sides panels,"It was missing side panels, and took 2-weeks to get replacement parts, so pool & deck time lost. Plus it cannot be sat on by 2-people it looks good, but will not hold 1 weighty person or 2-people light."
5,Great Buy,"Just got this 2 days ago. It took less than 10 minutes to put together. <br />Went away and it rained for 2 days. Nothing in the box got wet. It holds all my patio cushions, and then some more. Great buy for the price and effort."
2,It's too small and you can't return it once it's assembled.,"I thought my outdoor chair cushions would fit because the advertised dimensions of the deck box are a couple of inches larger than the cushions. Wrong! Once I got it assembled I learned that the INSIDE of the box is only 17 x 19 x 37 inches. The box is really sturdy, though, because I was unable to disassemble it in order to return it. Suncast's customer service department confirms that once the box is assembled it's permanent. So I'm stuck with it. I'm sure I can find some use for the box but will have to store my chair cushions somewhere else."
3,"Easy to assemble, impossible to take apart","I had no trouble assembling this item - true to the advertising on the box, only 5 minutes to assemble and no tools necessary. However, I discovered that it is too small for my deck furniture cushions. When I tried to take it apart, I could not. Those pieces snap into place - for good! My husband tried as well with no luck. We would have ruined it taking it apart. So, I cannot return it.Amazon's website did not, but should have listed the interior dimensions. We guessed, and guessed wrong, which is why it is of no use to us."
4,Great outdoor storage for the cost!,"Although I realize there is many more durable options, but they are at a 200-300% price increase. I living in Brooklyn and I play a lot of sports. My equipment cannot be in my apartment, so I have my things stored outside. Im very happy with my choice and nothing in this has gotten wet or damaged.I recommend grabbing 2 scraps of wood to put underneath so airflow surrounds this."
3,Vallue??,"While the storage container went together easily and seems pretty substantial, I'm not sure its worth the price. Seems kind of expensive for what you are getting."
4,Fills the bill,This might be the easiest thing I ever put together. Literally five minutes. It looks neat and stores a lot. We'll see how it holds up [...]
1,Poorly Designed,"Hinge on one side of the lid failed after 3 weeks of use. Called the manufacturer (Suncast) for replacement lid, but was told they do not warranty deck boxes and a new lid would cost $40.The hinge is poorly designed (weak plastic) as it can't withstand the force of the gas pistons that keep the lid open. The replacement lid would have failed again without some kind of home remedy to fortify the hinge.Thank you to Amazon's excellent customer service for standing behind a product that even the manufacturer would not.I would not recommend purchase of the Suncast DB12000PB 127-gallon Deck Box."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with this product, but glad I didn't pay full price. I don't think it's worth $50.00 let alone the regular price of $100.00. The ""stay dry design"" is partially true...the rain runs off the domed lid, however, the construction is not ""air tight"". The bottom is not a solid piece so items you store inside are still vulnerable to the elements.The fact that no tools are needed means it basically snaps together."
5,Bone Dry!,"Not much to say - except this is an excellent choice for extra deck storage. I've kept unopened seed packets in here with other garden tools. And seed packets really are very moisture sensitive.It's all stayed boned dry in even the worst downpours. I'm so pleased. There's really not much else to say. Extra storage, nice and dry. Nothing bad to speak of."
5,Exactly what we wanted- true to description & reviews,"So pleased with this deck box. We have it sitting on gravel on the side of our house so our two young boys can keep all of their outside toys neat and tidy when not in use. It has been outside for about a month now. Seems to be waterproof and holds a lot. Balls, shovels, trucks, bubbles, rackets, baseball bats, and I even had space left to add three folding captain's chairs. Looks nice with our white trim on our house too. Perfect solution for us!"
2,Cheaply made,"I was very disappointed in this Deck Box. While simple to assemble, the pieces do not go together squarely and therefore the entire unit is wracked and does not close tightly. And I made sure to store it under the eave of the house under the porch overhang as I am positive it will keep nothing dry over the winter. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Does this hold up to years of sun exposure???,"I have shopped for an item like this for years, after the cheap Rubbermaid container I got (of a similar size) cracked due to sun damage in its second year. This looks like a good deal, comparable to the best bargains I have found. But some catalog items I have found indicate that the plastic is UV-resistant, which is essential if plastic items are to be kept outside for years of use. I am hoping someone who has used this item for a while (at least two years!) can comment on its durability."
3,"Suncast DB5000 Deck Box, suitable but not sturdy.","While the box is nice, it is not very sturdy and doesn't fit much as far as something like cushions would go. If you wanted to store pool toys or small equipment for the pool in it it would be fine, otherwise I wouldn't have wasted my money on it had I realized just how flimsy it was. A great deal of the inside space is filled up with ""beams"" to try to make it sturdier than it really is, but unsuccessfully."
5,Good product,The package was in poor shape but the product was in good shape. It was a good price and product
2,A useful but cheap plastic box,"I purchased this box partly because of the price. After it arrived I found that although it is useful for keeping my patio free of clutter, it is nothing more than a cheaply made plastic box. Now if it was made like a Tyco kids products I would rate it higher, but it is more like a plastic trashcan, that surely will end up on the curb with them in the not to distant future."
3,"Great Amazon Price, but that's about all","This ""snap together"" plastic box is just a little up from the plastic storage boxes that every discount store sells. This one has a hinged cover, however.It goes together easily, and indeed is a plastic box. But that's it. It has all the pzazz of an aluminum lawn chair. (Sorry, no offense to aluminum lawn chair marching societies.)"
3,Not what I needed,"The unit does not stand off the ground. The bottom piece is flat on the ground. The inside is not aired out. I needed the bottom interior floor with open slats to drain out. It came shipped with a small infration on the lid side. I sent it back because it did not fit my requirements. Otherwise, it was easy to assemble. Regards"
4,Suncast Deckbox Makes Great Hidden Litterbox,"I purchased the deck box so I could create a hidden litter box for my rescue cats. This deck box was easy to assemble. I had it together in ten minutes. Afterwards, I cut three holes in the back, using a drill then a jig saw, lined the bottom with a plastic liner, and inserted three litter boxes. The only problem with it is I thought the top was flat and could become a seat for me or for my cats. It is, however, rounded. The off white color is not the greatest but I intend to paint it."
3,Pushing the limit,"This deck box seems to about push the limit of the Suncast design. It assembled easily, and it holds a ton of outdoor toys, but I'm glad I didn't go one size larger as the integrity/sturdiness appears to suffer the larger the container. I read the reviews of the larger boxes and opted for this one. So far I have not had issues with the wind blowing the lid open/off, or the box falling apart. I do believe the best use for this is for large, light, cumbersome items. I use it for big plastic trucks, t-ball bats and balls, badminton racquets et al, and bubbles/water guns. I would not load it down with heavy garden staples like sand, lime or soil. The kids can get in and out of it and I don't worry about the lid slamming on them because you pretty much have to hold it to keep it open and it's pretty light."
3,storage,"the chest is not adequate to store chair cushions, but will hold smaller items satisfactorily . I would recommend this item ."
5,tom,Works great. Went together in about 10 minutes. Probably over priced but home delivery was very important to me. No similar item available where I live.
5,Suncast DB5000 50-Gallon Deck Box,Great storage container! It is very spacious and roomy. I use it for storing blankets and pillows. placed it in our basement.
5,Does What it Says,This deck box fits all four of my cushions plus the unbrella and it can hold more! The deck box has been through many storms and high winds and has protected everything inside. It also was very easy to assemble and plus you don't need tools. Very happy with the product.
2,Decent quality,"The product itself is decent quality as expected from Suncoast. However, there is no way to lock the top so the wind won't blow it open on the dock. This is a major flaw by the manufacturer."
1,The lid didn't align with the box,"I returned this Deck Box the next day I received it. The body of the box was OK but not the lid. It might have been deformed on the way of transportation. It didn't align with the edge of the box, that leave a big gap at the opening, and rain might get into the box. It is also hard to disassemble. So, check everything very well before you put it together, otherwise, you would have to use 10 times the effort to take it down to pieces and you couldn't do that without breaking some of the click-in nuts."
4,Cheap outdoor storage,"If you need a cheap, simple plastic box to store things outside this product works well.It assembles easily and seems pretty sturdy.It's not very pretty, but I have mine out of sight storing extra grill and smoker accessories."
5,OUTSIDE STORAGE,Very pleased with item. It is extremely easy to put together and very sturdy and roomy. It's a must for outside storage with kids and pool toys!!!
3,Deck Box,It serves the purpose that we ordered it for but was a little disappointed in the flimsiness of the cover.
4,Great for the Price,"I had been researching deck boxes and found the best price for this one at Amazon. It is easy to put together and a very good buy for the money. The Amazon reviews helped me in determining to buy this one. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but wanted something good. I found it!"
2,Deck box is okay,"The deck box is nice looking and it was easy to set up, but it wasn't as big as I expected. It doesn't hold 4 chair cushions like I thought it would. The first night it rained everything inside stayed dry, but something happened to the lid where we now can't close it properly and when it rains everything inside gets wet."
4,does the job,"I bought this trunk two years ago to store cushions and gardening tools outdoors. It took a bit of patience to put together, but has hold everything nice and dry since. Would recommend."
4,Great deck storage,This is exactly what I was looking for to use as deck storage. It holds all of my deck chair cushions and a few baskets that we use to hold towels for our hot tub needs and more. Its watertight and insect proof so far and it also has a neat little flip top storage compartment that we sue to keep the kids goggles in for our hot tub. Its bigger than I thought and while the color is boring beige (I would have preferred gray) I am very pleased. Its a great buy and I recommend it 100%!
4,Bargain Workhorse Printer,"This was a reconditioned printer that works as good as a new one at less than half the cost.The next time I need another printer, I'm buying another one from these guys!"
3,Essentials of Latin Grammar,"A pretty good book, but definately not for the beginner ignorant of Latin. It is more of a good supplimental book for learning Latin."
3,Can You Really Master Latin?,"If you plan to use this book as your only teaching tool--good luck. With any language, a book will not help you fluently speak it. You have to do the work yourself, and use books as helpful tools. This is well setup and doesn't contradict anything in classical Latin (the same can not be said for Chruch Latin, which isn't usually taught in school). I liked it, but only gave it three stars because I don't think you should spend too much money on Latin books when you can easily get the same information in just about any textbook."
4,Wonderful love story,"After the slaughter of her husband and child in the chaos of the Civil War, Sarah Peters had been taken prisoner by the Comanche. Freed at last she returns home only to be shunned. Sarah agrees to marry rancher Hunter Tate in name only, and went to live with him in a place where no one knew about her in Texas. But soon she started to fall for Hunter.Great read."
1,This book is terrible,"I purchased this book based on the Einstein quote on the back cover, and clearly the man has his limitations. This book is powerfully uninteresting. The author is pedantic and uninspiring. The great ideas of mathematics are in there of course, but it is hard to imagine them being more poorly presented. I highly recommend reading Bell's Men of Mathematics if you want to gain some insight into the great ideas of mathematics written by someone of a broad mind and sound judgement who happens to know how to write. Of course, if you want to be a better mathematician, bust out your Calc book and do some problems. This book tries to be both narrative and teacher's aide and ends up being neither."
1,shoulder pads,The pads show very badly through your clothes. They are stiff and the velcro makes a loud sound every time you move.
1,Disatisfied with the company---SilverSpoon,"I ordered the product on November 27--it was to be a Christmas present THe product was not available from Amazon at the time so Amazon sent me to Silver Spoon. I was informed by Silver Spoon that my product was mailed on Dec. 14. Then I was told that it was back ordered. By December 27th it had not been received! Amazon refunded my money. I have had very good luck ordering from Amazon, but I will not do business with Silver Spoon again, and I told them so."
2,Suncast SFB200 - changing o-rings?,"Have had 2 years and it was leaking water from the in-tube side. I tried to change the o-rings following the instructions. However, when I popped out the black in-tube piece, it popped out with such force that it hit my face above my upper lip and cut it open. I now have a half-inch vertical slit on my top lip covered with a butterfly strip. It bled a lot. I still cannot figure out how to get to the O-ring to change it. Is there a hose reel that a 100 lb., 5'2"" woman can easily and safely perform o-ring maintenance?"
3,Replacement parts are available,"We've had one of these, or maybe the previous model, for close to 10 years, I believe. It has held up well, except that the elbow shaped out-tube splits every couple years and has to be replaced.I'd like to let everyone who is looking for replacement parts know that they are readily available from suncast.com."
1,Wouldn't buy this.,"Very cheap. Handle is made of cheap plastic and will break. Leaks, but i did change the O-ring. Front of unit to light and lifts up when I wind up the hose. I don't recommend you buy this, but that's your decision. Needs to be made of stronger plastics."
1,Don't buy this item for god sake!,"I purchased this not too long ago. As soon as I opened the box and began to put it together I noticed that the main frame the ""A"" portion was exactly the same part as the other ""A"" portion. Therefore you couldn't possibley put it together at all. Save yourself some time, pain, and suffering and just buy one at Wal-Mart or something."
2,Leakage,The plastic connector leaks due to stress cracking. No replacement part is available. A previous reviewer indicated that recent Suncast models still use the same connector. I would not buy another Suncast hose reel for this reason regardless of the cost.
1,Don't do IT,"First of all it doesn't hold 225 hose, It barely holds 200 ft. and even at that it's over the spool. The drift pins that hold the handle didn't last a week I had to replace them with heaver screws. Then the front cross peace keeps coming off every time I move it. I used it today and the cross peace finally broke off...That's it I went to a farm supply store and bought a steel, four wheel cart,on sale for $64. Now were talking. The Suncast is going to the recycle center in the morning. Never again."
2,You won't be thrilled,This product is of dubious design and quality. Using it provides for a garden hose management solution that is moderately better than just keeping the hose in a pile. The plastic used is thin and it appears a matter of time before something goes awry and breaks or falls off. Also - assembly is not difficult but you can tell the engineering behind the product is second rate. It works for now but I am less than confident in this being a long term solution. Its one of the cheapest hose-coiling devices available and when you get it you will see why you saved some money on it - because its not a good product.
2,Suncast HRC200 Hosemobile 225-Foot Hose Reel Cart,Suncast HRC200 Hosemobile 225-Foot Hose Reel CartI'm very disappointed with the materials that went into the construction of the Suncast HRC200 225-Foot Hose Reel Cart. The wheels are too small and the gauge of plastic for the overall cart is too thin to provide reasonable support for heavy hoses containing water. The cart always leaned to one side or the other and was hard to move. I used it for one season and finally ended up putting it out with the trash. What's a shame is the Suncast Hose Reel I previously had for 7 years worked just great.
4,FANTASTIC product support,"I picked one of these up for free on the side of the road. It was missing pieces and broken. After piecing it back together, I found it had a leak in the out tube. Getting parts could not have been easier. Their website is simple to navigate, and ordering is easy. I placed my order on a weekend, and had my part delivered via FedEx to my door in 3 days. For EIGHT BUCKS, shipping included! They included all parts that I needed, and even clear, articulated ENGLISH instructions. They even gave me a complete in-tube/out-tube assembly, and a tiny little packet of silicone lubricant to help renew my seal. I couldn't be happier. When it's time to replace my hose reel, I will be buying another Suncast product. Thanks!"
2,adequate,For my occasional use it is satisfactory. It is light and breaks easily. What I need now is a new handle. Can I get it from you or at a local store?
1,Cheap and flimsy,"Might be suitable for occasional use with a lightweight hose, but if your needs are any greater than that, keep away, spend a few extra bucks for a beefier product."
3,"Fragile, flimsy, too low to ground...JUNK","I'm 5'11"" and have bend way over to reel in the hose.The spool is very full if you put the amount on it advertised.The handle/crank is ridiculously flimsy - approx. 1/16"" thick, and it snapped right off after only modest pressure and I only bought it around 10-14 months ago. Very difficult to repair, which means more solid waste in the landfill, unless I find a repair kit cheap.UPDATE: Customer service shipped new handle promptly for $4, and they've improved design some, w/ additional reinf. ridge. BUT, after contacting Suncast via Menards, they were AWESOME in responding, immediately shipping me an improved/upgrade model at no charge. I'm AMAZED. I give the orig. product. a 1 still, but customer service a 5. If I like the new product, I'll likely give that a full 5 stars, taking into account this wonderful service. PLUS it's AMERICAN MADE. :-)"
2,You Get What You Pay For,The reel is easy to use however it doesn't last -- the handle broke after a couple of years.
1,broke the first time I used it,"I bought this model to replace the Suncast Smart Trak Hose box that broke after about 10 weeks of barely being used ... this model broke the first time I tried to wind a 50 ft hose onto it. They all break in the same place, where the take up barrel meets the winding wheel. Do yourself a favor and stay away from the products made by Suncast... spend a few dollars more and buy something more sturdy, In the end it will save you money.. and a headache"
2,Outtube not available at Suncast,"The outtube cracked on my Hosemobile HRC200 in the same place other reviewers mentioned. I ordered one from Suncast based on the tiny pictures on the website. It didn't fit. When I described my outtube, the lady at Suncast customer service quickly exclaimed that they had depleted their stock of 'those' replacements. I asked if there was any other option to repair the unit. She said NO! then abruptly said ""GOODBYE"" and hung up. Honestly, I had been upbeat with her during the entire (short) conversation. I now own a cracked outtube and a new useless one. Obviously my next reel will not be a SUNCAST model."
2,Slow moving,I normally like Robyn Carr's novels but this one was boring. After struggling to read a few chapters I skipped to the ending to see what happened.
1,"Review of Chill Brazil, Vol. 3","I was very disappointed listening to most of the songs in Vol.3, especially after listening to Chill: Brazil, Vol. 2. In fact, I've only listened to it once because it's not relaxing at all. At work, I normally listen to music. When I listen to Vol. 2, I feel relaxed like I'm on a beach in Brazil. But, I just don't get the same feeling when listening to Vol. 3. I hope your Vol. 4 is much like Vol. 2. Sorry about the low rating, but I have to tell the truth and also to help you decide what to put on your next volume."
4,A horrorific good rocker,"I'm only writing this because the ONE review on here for the album is so...vague.I have the vinyl version of Monster a Go Go, which doesn't have the last two tracks listed on the CD, but they can only make a great album better! The songs hereon are all monster/horror themed, mostly covers (I think one or two are actually original compositions), performed in the typically fun garage-rock lo-fi style of The Fuzztones, with Protrudi putting on his best morose monotone for the proceedings. This is a great album for dwellers in the dark side of life, garage-rock fans or anyone looking for a totally kick-ass set of tunes for a Hallowe'en party!"
5,ENJOYABLE TO READ,Alison creates characters that are easy to identify with and care for. I read this book on the plane home from vacation and I wanted the flight to be a little longer so I could finish the book!! Very enjoyable to see the story from 3 different character views.
3,Worlds Collide by Alison Strobel,"This fictional book was thoroughly enjoyable! I felt a part of the story and could feel what the characters were feeling while I read. I identified with moments where you battle your sinful flesh to either do and think selfishly (living for today), or selflessly (living for eternity). I took away from the book that genuine consistency in our spiritual walk; what we say and do; is of utmost importance when desiring to display Christ in our lives to those around us. I am thankful for that reminder! I look forward to reading future books written by this author!FTC Disclaimer: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
5,"Jan Smith raw, earthy sound is worth every minute","""Tin Heart"", Jan Smith's first album rang with an intimacy and personality that surely attracted listeners. ""29 Dances"" looses none of that closeness even with the bigger sound produced by Nashville producer Bill VornDik. ""Woman Your Guitar"" is a saucy tale of regret that is sure to offend and entertain with it's witty lyrics and masterful guitar work.Get this one."
4,Spunky,"Jan Smith continues her winning ways from her first CDTin Heart. ""Woman Your Guitar"" sets your toe to tapping with its down-home acoustic beat & tongue-in-cheek lyric about the importance of music, ""Don't give a woman a guitar that you want back; Don't give her all your records in a stack; She will learn Big River & she'll start wearing black."" ""Rum in My Morning Coffee"" has song tasty twanging guitar by Johnny Hiland with Jan's seductive lyric, ""A little vodka in my tonic, a little song to help me sleep; I'll take the time that silence buys 'cause nothing satisfies me like you."" David Talbot's banjo and the lovely melody make ""Simple Path to Freedom"" a gem. The CD concludes with country swing on the spunky ""True Love,"" ""Don't be slow; don't you turn on no TV show; I've got a yearning, baby, don't you know, Oh I could be your true love."" ""29 Dances"" is a country/folk confection. Enjoy!"
1,Damaged product,DVD will not work. Returned twice with the same result. I purchsed it at a competitor and it was the same result.
1,"MINE WOULDN'T PLAY, EITHER","Hey Dennis Carter, you're not alone! I got this DVD and it will not playat all (the first out of the 200+ DVD's I own). When you hit ""play"",nothing happens, even though the counter moves. When you go to ""selectedscenes"" and choose one, nothing happens either. Total waste of money.Too bad, I'm a Beatles fanatic too. I'll stick with my ""Anthology"" DVD's."
4,The Unseen Beatles,"If you are a true Beatles Fan you will like this.It has some great black and white footage and some really cute scences with the ""Fab Four"".It is not the Best DVD on the lads I have ever seen and trust me I have lots of them in my Beatles collection of VHS and DVD's, but it is worth having. it is done well and it is very Clear. I really liked adding it to my Collection.luvmusic12/02/07"
1,Technical difficulties,"I purchased this item here, then another from Newbury Comics, then another from Target. None of them worked."
5,massive,"It's a pefect bowl for my needs, I posted the photos i mainly will use it for bread making and canning its a massive bowl how can it be wrong? i had to find a special place to store it in my case above my water heater in laundry room its made in India like the other bowls in my pictures its not very heavy duty but will meet the needs of most, Amazon picture is incorrect mine are correct, it sits flat and i enjoyed making dough in it with out making a huge mess another plus ,in my book only thing that would make it better would be a lid :)"
3,"Bigger than advertised, too big to use","Pro: The item arrived quickly and in perfect condition, and the price is quite reasonable.If you want a really big stainless steel bowl, this is a good choice.Con: It's bigger than advertised - too big to be useful. It's not worth the shipping to send it back.It's supposed to be a 20 quart bowl (no dimensions given); the one I got was 24 quarts, and about 18-1/2 inches wide on the outside of the rim (17-1/2 inside diameter). I can't even keep it in the kitchen because it's so big, and my wife finds it disturbingly large.It might be that different buyers will get different products; mine was packaged in a very sloppy and amateur-looking way, and it looked like it was a one-off surplus item. So you might get a 20 qt bowl, who knows?"
4,Kids love stickers!,"I won't lie and tell you this is a literary masterwork. However, sometimes little kids need a simple, but creative diversion and I would really recommend any sticker book that deals with any subject which they have an interest. It is a nice diversion to see them ""create"" a story based on how they play with the stickers."
3,Safeguarding My Identity,So far this book is informative and exposes alot of things that one may not think of. I'm glad that I will have this book on hand should I need help in this situation.
1,What a terrible cd.,All twelve groups on this album should write Tom Petty a formal letter of apology.
1,The Losers Didn't Get Lucky This Time,"CAUTION! This CD IS hazardous to your health, karma, and piece of mind. If you are a collector of ALL THINGS PETTY then there may be a place in the corner of your basement for this disk. Otherwise save your money or take a friend to lunch or better yet invest it in any other CD that Amazon offers. The covers of Insider, Breakdown, and Nightwatchman are just very hard to sit through...seriously hard, seriously. (If my redundance changes just one mind my my work here is done). American Girl by Everclear is a not too bad cover. Stop Draggin' My Heart Around by Loud Lucy isn't offensive in the least...high praise indeed! If you pass through this world without hearing the rest, well, You Got Lucky..."
1,Tom Should....,"I think Tom & Mike should hunt down whoever put this travisty together along with the {cough, cough} artists who contributed to it & rip 'em to shreads for makin' my ears bleed.... I've heard a lot of crap in my day but this is sacrilege...."
1,Product Description is incorrect,"Beware. Although the product description says this unit has 2 AV inputs and an IR transmitter for headphones, it has neither. It only has 2 VIDEO inputs. There are no audio inputs, and no facilities for wireless headphones."
4,Cute and smells really nice.,"I have a friend who bought a small Corolle doll for her daughter and just loved all the hair on it, so when I was looking for a new doll for my daughter, I chose one too. She is so cute and is big/small enough to be manageable for my 3 1/2 year old to move in and out of a stroller, etc. I thought I read somewhere that you could style this dolls hair with styling tools like a curling iron, but I am too nervous to try. The hair is pretty, but does tangle a bit and might be hard for a child to keep nice. She's so cute that I'm willing to help with that- gives me an excuse to play with her too!!!"
4,Another Great Season,"This is as intriguing a show as any on television right now, and the second season just gets better. The reasons that I gave it only 4 stars as opposed to five are that 1)(technical)there isn't a ""play all"" feature for the disks. 2)(plot)the ""personal"" issues of Elle go too far, and I'm ready for her to leave when she does. Other than that, a great season."
3,Spoilers listed...Hmmm....an interesting season but,not one that I can say I enjoyed. Elle is written off the show after her life is saved and she acted like she soooo wanted to get back to work. A new girl that you can only warm up to by the end of the season.One of the rescued victims that were rescued in the first of the season is killed in the end which is disappointing. The episodes themselves seemed more like horror flicks than something ripped from headlines. I KNOW alot of these shows could happen but who wants to watch it!
5,Thank you!,My friend borrowed it as soon as I got it and was pleased with it and would watch it again.
4,Season 2,My daughter is such a fan.We will be getting more seasons!A great value.Newer seasons cost more so will wait it out.
5,Great show,"The last season with the original cast, and introducing Prentiss to the team. Especially enjoy the storyline with Reid and the dynamics of the team."
3,Criminal Minds,gave it 3 stars because in the case holding the first two dvd's the plastic that holds them in place all broke off now dvd's are loose in the case
3,Finding Criminal minds,I just barely found this show and the whole profiling and serial killer thing is very interesting but the show needs work. AJ Cook is the real reason I started to watch. But they need to do more character developement and this whole mens club thing is annoying. I want to see more of garcia and especially JJ. Again I love AJ cook and she deserves to have more screen time. But I'm starting to like the show more and more and now that Mandy patikan is gone I think it will get even better. Can't wait for the new season so I can see My Girl!
5,GREAT Show-Great DVD,"I love Criminal Minds and watch it every week. I bought this DVD and have watched it completely on several occasions. It is just a great DVD, if you like analysis, human behavior and basic crime drama. The Bonus features are also great. They have commentary and it gives you a real inside view of the cast and how the show is created and how much time, effort, etc is put into this show. Great DVD!"
5,Criminal Minds,"Started out catching a couple of episodes of the current season. Liked it so much, I bought the previous seasons as a Christmas gift for my husband (ya- right - it was really for me, who am I kidding). We both enjoy it so much that we are addicted!! Well worth the purchase"
4,Criminal Minds Season 2 --- Better than the 1st Season?,I was very wary of buying season 2 beacuse in my experience if you love the 1st season of something the 2nd season is never quite as good. But I was excited that this wasn't the case with Criminal Minds Season 2!! The 2nd season in my opinion is better than the 1st one. I will warn you that the 2nd season is a little darker than the 1st season was but it is soooo good!!! I would def. recommend buying it!!!!
5,Season 2 Criminal Minds,This is a great series and it should only be viewed by adults due to the nature of the content.
5,Another Great Season,"Criminal Minds is a great show, it adds depth to what is often a shallow line up of crime dramas. The second season is merely a continuation of what proved to be an amazing first season."
5,"Criminal Minds DVDs (shades of ""Dexter"")","Great show, great DVDs. You don't have to put up w/ commercials and can watch as many episodes at once as you can handle. This has added to my appreciation of the writing and acting on this show. The actors are not all stereotypes, they are different, they are even fun. Anyone who has not yet seen Criminal Minds and who loves ""Dexter"" on ShowTime will like this show too. Far better than the usual TV fare."
5,I love this TV show!!,"I have been watching this program from the beginning and I have started to collect the seasons this year. I especially love season one and two because the character Jason Gideon was in the lead role those two years and I really like him a lot. But none of the seasons disappoint in the least. This is a great series and if you haven't checked it out yet, you really should give it a chance and watch a few episodes. I think you will end up as hooked as millions of other viewers have become."
5,criminal minds second season,I am a criminal minds freak. I don;t know why. Maybe it is because of the actors and the parts they play so well. I recommend but not to the faint of heart.
4,Love this show - but having problems with disc 5,"This is one of my favorite procedural cop shows and I love sitting down to watch them on DVD in order every so often. However, I was watching my copy of season 2 this weekend and found that disc 5 will show the menue but will not allow me to scroll between episodes to actually watch these four episodes on the disc. I exchanged the disc at a retail store and the second disc had the same problem.... very frustrating. I look forward to getting a working copy so that I can once again enjoy my favorite searies in order!!"
3,Slaves to the Machine,"The BAU finds themselves in Seattle on the trail of a serial bomber who has fear of Technology. What are the bombers motives for setting off the bombs and what connection do they have to an old Science Fiction story called ""Empty Planet""?"
4,Helps Keep Stove Surface Cleaner,I was very happy to find this item. I've owned one for over 10 years. It helps keep the stove cleaner when I'm cooking. It has never had a bit of rust but I wash it after each use and dry it. I don't put it in the dishwasher. I was very happy to get the extra splatter guard. The first one I bought is still in use. It doesn't prevent all splatters from getting on the stove surface but it is much better than not using anything.
4,Less Mess,"The splatter screen does help to cut down on the mess of frying bacon, etc. But be careful......You can get cut on the edge, so when washing and drying, be aware."
4,A great product for camping,I have used this splatter guard for wilderness camping using small single burner camp stoves with great success. I use one on the ground to act as a heat shield and stable support for the stoves. I use two more to shield the wind.
4,works great,"THis works great! It's so basic, I'm glad someone thought to design and make one of these. It fits around almost any size pan, and really controls the grease spatter. I use it with my spatter shield on the pan, and my stove stays pretty clean."
5,Grrrrreat,"My mom has had one for years, so then I got one for myself, I love it and it is very sturdy"
1,razor sharp edges,"I ordered these for gifts, because I have a different brand I purchased many years ago and everyone that sees it wants one. When I opened it I almost cut myself on the edges. The one I have was nothing like these. They are sharp and can not be put in dishwasher. Very disappointed, cheaply made and not safe."
1,Shoddy and dangerous,"This product is shoddy and the edges of the metal screens are so thin and sharp they can cut you - especially in a kitchen enviornment with wet hands, etc. I gave it one star because we don't have a zero star option. I returned for a refund."
1,Worthless piece of trash,"Length:: 3:10 MinsThis is my first ever video review of a product on Amazon. I was inspired to do a video review because this product is so appallingly awful. I'm stunned by the positive reviews - they're either reviewing some other product, or their shills, or, well, I don't really know what would cause someone to give this product a positive review. Hopefully this video demonstrating how flimsy and downright tiny this so-called splatter guard is will save others the trouble and cost of buying one."
1,BEWARE - Super sharp edges!!!,"I DO NOT recommend this splatter screen, even though I was extremetely careful I still cut myself. The edges are super sharp, item is very flimsy. BAD BUY!"
3,Does the job,"I found these guards kind of hard to find so I'm happy just to have one. It was a little smaller than I expected as I thought it would be a little taller. The only other thing is that it's very thin and the edges are quite sharp. If you're not careful, you can easily cut your finger like I did when I was washing it. Be careful!"
2,"Great Idea, very sharp","I have the old style which is a little heavier and has all rolled edges This one is very thin aluminum and very very sharp edgesI have cut myself twice now.. So I put ""duck tape"" all around the edges, if they would roll the edges they are a great thingwhen cooking..."
1,Poor Product - Poorer Customer Service,"Ordered two (2) Splatter Shield Guards through Amazon from ""Web's Best Deals"". Received one(1) in usable condition, but the other was missing a hinge pin and cannot be assembled.Both Amazon and World's Best Deals have failed to even reply what more comply with my request which was to SEND ME THE MISSING HINGE PIN.Now I will begin action to return their junk."
4,WORKS FOR ME,"I disagree with the other reviewers however I didn't purchase it to prevent grease spatter (I use a splatter screen when sauteing). Due to my kichen design the only place I could put the tv was next to the stove. I use this to contain the heat from cooking pots from damaging my tv & it works GREAT. I do find that it does prevent grease splatter as well. As far as the comments regarding it being ""flimsy"", I have found that if you treat it well (no dishwasher), dry it well before storing... it is more than adequate for the money."
3,nice but,I ve been looking around to save myself time to clean the kitchen ..was glad to see this similar product I was using in Japan only this is shorter ..also the sides cut me 3x already ..it is way too sharp ..my daughter had cuts too..be very careful using this ...i am considering covering the edges with something..
4,Norpro Splatter Screen Guard,"Received product as stated. Works find, however, is difficult to clean, Leaves lines on the product that do no want to come off."
4,stops splatter,"I ordered three of these to go all the way around my stove. I have a roommate that stir fries EVERYTHING and never covers her pans and I was sick of grease splatter all over my coffee maker, blender and everything else near the stove. These work great, now if I can just get my roommate to clean off the splatter guard..."
5,KITCHEN HELPER,"I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE A LONG, LONG TIME AGO. IT HAS SERVED ME WELL - SO WHEN I RAN ACROSS THIS ONE I WENT AHEAD AND BOUGHT TWO. THESE ARE BETTER SINCE THEY COME WITH A COATED FINISHED. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. GOOD IDEA AT A REASONABLE PRICE."
1,Don't Bother,"I thought I would need one when I fry, but soon realized I really have no use for these. They just sit in my kitchen un-used."
4,As Time Goes By.....,"""Casablanca"" has remained a beloved screen classic. And author Jeff Siegel's fourth book, ""The Casablanca Companion--The Movie And More"" rekindles any embers into roaring fanned flames. This short but complete work is chocked full of interesting anecdotes, fun trivia quizzes, behind the scenes juicy as Georgia peaches gossip, wonderful photos, and much more.I happened to meet Mr. Siegel e-lectronically a few years back. His wit and humor revealed he must be a writer, a good one. Our type/talk of books and movies was, forgive me, ""...the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""Spend some time on memory lane with the video and this added companion to ""Casablanca"", you'll have no regrets.Thank you for your interest & comments--CDS"
1,A throwaway book for a plane ride,I bought this book to read something that was fiction by this author. I thoroughly enjoyed his biography of the Duchess of Windsor and wanted to read something else he had written.This wasn't that interesting to me. I didn't finish reading it.
3,sephora mini clear brush set,"This really was 'mini'. I was surprised at how small it really was, but it did arrive quickly and maybe I should have paid closer attention to the word 'mini'."
5,Sephora brushes,"These are wonderful, and they make perfect stocking stuffers! The brushes are nice quality and I keep a set in my purse for those afternoon touch-ups. Also fits nicely in to an evening bag."
2,Product fine. Delivery was not what I expected..,"I ordered patch cables. I now have them & they work fine.The problem was delivery. I selected ""Standard delivery"" which had them delivered by DHL. When I did not receive them on time, I contacted Parts Express who said they had no record of my sale & suggested that I contact Amazon. I had my order number & such, but they told me I did not buy from them??When I contacted DHL, I found they handed off to the Postal Service. I found them at the local Post office.The whole delivery & customer service process was handled in a cumbersome manner."
2,Made in China,"I bought the 45 Pcs, And I could say I was a bit disappointed. But what could I expect from a cheap China Set. The Brand name is Queen's."
3,"Interesting, if not too penetrating","Not a very deep book but a pretty enjoyable introduction to Santeria and some related subjects. I like the author's honesty when describing the occasional self-delusion and fakery in the religion - not many religious folks are that honest. I also liked the chapter at the end about racism in Cuba - that's also not a subject that gets much honest treatment. Other parts, like music in Santeria, I thought pretty weak."
5,A wonderful book by a wonderful man!,"In a very odd turn of events, *I* do not have anything further to say about this wonderful book. To read it is to know what I mean.(-_-)"
1,LOW BUDGET,"I'm sorry, but I've seen every Metallica video/documentary, and this was horrible. Everything mentioned in this DVD is obvious to the average Metallica fan. It was a big waste of my money. There was no Metallica interviews. All I got out of this video is that the cover band ""Creeping Death"" sucks!"
2,Stay Away From it !!!,"First there is NO Metallica , its Even not a Documentry . People talking about Metallica (Metallica shouldn't have done that and this)....And an Avrage Cover Band , And thats it !!! why waste $$ Go to a chat Room and talk about your favorite Band (METALLICA) . Buy YEAR & A HALF or watch VH1 Behind The Music To learn more about this GREAT BAND ."
3,Lexmark Z816 Printer,"I bought 6 of these printers at Office Max about 8 months ago. Only paid $15.99 each. I used one for printing and the rest to replace the ink cartridges when they ran out. The printer did a decent job of printing, even photos. After that I donated the printers to our local non-profit thrift store. They were able to sell them for $30 a piece! Everybody won all the way around! I can't understand why they are asking $275.99 for one on Amazon. Papa Larry H"
1,Worst.Printer.Ever.,"This printer was impossible to install. I accidently made a mistake while installing this printer, and its impossible to reverse the effects of it. I finally found a way to uninstall the printer driver and software, but even after installing it again (the right way this time) it still doesn't work. No wonder you see so many Lexmark printers at the thrift store, and no wonder you see retailers practically giving away this printer with new computers and new digital cameras."
5,Works great for me!,"I bought this item a little over a year ago. I live in the mountains in colorado, and this hose reel has been mounted outside at a southern exposure, so it gets FULL sun ALL DAY. Also I didn't take it down this winter, it handeled the elements just fine. The reel works fine, the hose feed works great as long as you line the hose in front of the reel (which I don't find a problem with). Also pulling out the hose through the feed is best to pull it from the front, not on an angle. For $30 this reel is great for me, of course it may not function like the $150 ones, but I don't care!"
2,Wall-Mount Hose Reel :(,"This hose reel installs with four screws that are 15"" apart :(Since it is designed as a wall mount I was hopping for 16"" on center mounting capabilites.Most exterior walls do have particle board or plywood sheeting under the siding, but after a few years of use I suspect this will come lose."
1,Don't waste your money.,These hose reels don't appear to be very well made. The hose guide is more trouble than it's worth. It needs a bottom support to be of much use. These are for very light use. I doubt they will last me one season in my yard.
1,Poor quality,"I have been using it infrequently for about a month now and my comment is that it is bad. The build quality is low, it broke after several uses. Really unreliable. The hose guide is useless.Very disappointed.Don't buy it, seriously."
2,broken crank handle and not covered by warrenty,Poorly designed crank handle flimsy and weak broke under normal gentle use
1,Bitten twice,"To be succinct:1. Gave the product two chances.2. Product failed in less than two years both times3. Hose ""Guide"" didn't work on either. Removed them4. Attachment to brick wall couldn't be tightened in place--no access. As result, was loose and would come off wall on upstroke of retrieval.5. Connection of retriever wheel to reel failed making retrieval a manual task.6. Lessen finally learned. Ordered aluminum reel. We'll see.7. ""No Stars"" wasn't an option or I would have chosen that one."
4,Great Unit,I am replacing my old unit only because i wore it out after five years in the Florida Sunshine. Will try another one. Can't delive the Texas review that his is a bad purchase.
1,Crap,"The size of this unit makes it appear that it can handle a very long length of hose. It is quite heavy when attached to the exterior brick and you know that eventually your anchors are going to pull out from the weight. Last but not least, the spool is completely broken in half after less than a year. I have now been bitten 3 times on Suncast products. I would give this zero stars if I could. I will definitely tell my husband not to waste any more money on this brand when he is at Lowes."
2,The Plastic Turned Brittle in 12 months,I guess this product is not made to withstand direct sunlight. My unit turned brittle after 12 months of use and the right wheel's mechanical parts fell apart.
1,Cheap junk,"I bought this to use in my back yard. After 6 months the rotating seal would pop out every time I turned on the water and then walked somewhere reeling out the hose and nozzle to sprinkle my plants. To not have the supply hose pop off and geyser water I had to first stretch out the hose to the location I wanted to water, then walk back and turn on the water faucet and then walk back to the nozzle and use it. A pain. The water pressure from the faucet isn't high at all. I tried screwing in the rotating seal plate, which kept it from blowing off, but then the entire hose reel would pop off the supply connector and squirt water everywhere.Conclusion: bad design, cheap plastic parts that warp and won't seal and operate under use."
1,Whoever wrote the directions should be severely punished!,"The product feels weak, like it might break at any time. Not the sturdy quality of my other hose reel. AND - the directions must have been written by a jerk who never tried to execute them with a clear mind. I'm 65 years old, can read and understand, and have assembled many things in my lifetime. Without doubt, these are the worst directions I've ever encountered. And they did not ""lose something in translation"" - they were written in English! I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product."
3,Works well now!,"I had problems with the TWM Hose reel initially. The water supply feed hose kept poping out. I called Suncast, they advised me on what should be done and sent a new water feed assembly. It has working fine ever since replacing those parts."
2,Sigh.....,"I loved Boy meets girl,and the boy nexy door.But i think this book is totally on my Sucky List of chick lit number 2!Althogh it's still a page turner but the romance betwee Cal and Jane isn't as touching as the ones that Meg Cabot's previous books and tons of places are really cheezy.It kind of give me the feeling that Mrs.Cabot wrote this book just to dig money.You can feel that with her talent, she didn't even spend over a week or so getting the idea and writing it into a book."
1,Yuck,"I have read a number of Meg Cabot books in the past and haven't ever been disappointed enough not to finish one until now. However, by page 63 I became turned off enough to say ""enough"" with her latest novel, Every Boy's Got One.By page 63, the e-mail format had worn thin, and the dialogue was just downright silly. Thirty-year old women conversing like they're a pair of 15-year olds is not attractive, nor realistic. And by page 63 Cabot has inserted two anti-America comments that did nothing for the plot or the dialogue. Very gauche for a successful author to bite the hand that feeds her.This novel may be appealing to the diehard Cabot fan, or the indiscriminate chick-lit fan. Better luck next time, Meg."
5,Very Funny,"My best friend and I really enjoyed this book. She read it, said it was really good and then gave it to me to read. We thought it was really funny and loved the emailing, I guess because we do the same thing. We also really liked Boy Meets Girl and Boy Next Door."
2,"Unless you are a die-hard Cabot fan, skip this book.","I am an avid fan of Meg Cabot's books (both her adult books and her teen books) and I was not impressed with this latest edition. I've read both 'Boy Meets Girl' and 'The Boy Next Door' and enjoyed them alot so I was excited to read this book. I found the main character to be rather blah, and I did not like her love interest, Cal. I also found the ending to be abrupt and really unbelievable even in the fantasy-land of a make believe romance.Unless you are a major Meg Cabot fan I'd skip this book and re-read 'Boy Meets Girl' or 'Boy Next Door' as they are much better books."
2,Definitely Not Cabot's Best,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed both The Boy Next Door and Boy Meets Girl, Every Boy's Got One just didn't cut it from me. I found the story exceedingly bland and I could not stand the character Jane. I couldn't see why Cabot put her in such a critical role in the book, when she was neither cordial, interesting, or, for that matter, all that educated. It got a little better in the end, but the ending was so unrealistic and not touching, I had to set the book down at once. I personally feel I cannot skip books in a series, but if you can, do yourself a favor and ignore Every Boy's Got One."
4,"Interesting, delicious","The story plot isn't actually mind blowing, but it is intersting. Characters are believable, and the romance parts aren't disgustingly unbearable as other types of romance novels. I love the way she uses e-mails, diary entries, journals etc to show how characters feel and what they actually say to each other, but I don't find the other extras really useful at all, like the menues and receipts in Italian( as i can't read Italian). The ending was a happy one, but I wish Meg Cabot could have written more about it, as it wasn't really that satifying to me."
3,Chicklit with a twist...,"Lately I have found the chicklit I've been reading has been filled with cardboard characters and predictable plots. This book made me realize there is better stuff out there. What starts as a travel journal for Jane's best friend Holly, instead turns it Jane's own private diary as she accompanies Holly to Italy for Holly's elopement. Holly's fiancé, Mark, has also invited his best friend Cal along. The story is told via Jane's travel journal at first, but soon includes text messages and e-mail as well. I really liked this touch because we got to know Cal better as well. The setting, in Castelfidardo, Italy, was also quaintly eccentric, and added to the story as well."
5,Interesting way of presenting a story,"I am so glad that I read this book. I had never read a Meg Cabot book before She Went All the Way, and I was not impressed with that book. This book, however, was very good. The story is presented in a series of emails, receipts, restaurant menus, journal entries, and instant messages. The author did a fabulous job of bringing all these medias together to form a complete story. There is much humour throughout the book, and I found myself laughing out loud lots of times. I finished the book in a matter of days because it is a cute story and a quick read.After reading this, I will definitely be reading more Meg Cabot books."
4,What does every boy have? You'll have to read to find out.,"This is just a cute story. I couldn't put it down. As is typical in a Meg Cabot story the whole thing takes place via, email, text messaging, pda journals, travel journals, website blogs etc, no direct conversations are actually had between any of the characters.Holly and Mark want to elope in Italy because their families are against their union, he's jewish she's catholic, so they bring their 2 best friends Jane and Cal to Italy to be their best man and maid of honor. This is the story of trying to get Holly and Mark to the altar. Cal's anti-marriage, and Jane just believes these 2 are meant to be, so what happens when the maid of honor and best man have to try to get along in order to make the wedding happen."
2,not as good...,"I enjoyed all of Meg Cabbots previous books, but this one was not as good as i excpected. There were some funny parts, but the plot was too unbelievable. I would not reccommend this book, but stick with her other works."
4,Much fun and a very easy read!,"I love the format of emails, PDA's and blackberries! I first read this style in Boy Meets Girl and loved it so I went out and got this book next. I liked BMG better (I thought it was much funnier!), but this one is really good too."
4,4.5 STARS REALLY - Fast Read,"I have really loved the Meg Cabot books - I enjoy that they are very fast reads but cute stories with funny characters and plots. I saw someone noted it was silly - that's what makes it funny! Anyway, this book is really a 4.5 star book and can be read in literally just a few hours. Perfect for the beach or lazy afternoon/weekend when you just want to relax and not have a deep or intense read."
2,"A Little Fun, A Lot of Stupid","Really a dumb book. I'd suggest it for airplanes or poolside holidays. Few redeeming elements, I'm sorry to say. It was well-written and light, but also very very obvious and silly. The kind of book where a running joke is women trying to guess how big a guy's thing is. Of course, the girl gets the guy and his thing is huge. Now isn't that the sweetest ending ever?"
4,Enjoyable,"Every Boy's Got One was all around a pretty good read. It's absolutely worth the purchase price, at least, although it wasn't a perfect book. The relationship moved too quickly for me, and Cal wasn't all that likeable, however not to the point where it ruined the book. If you liked this one, you should read The Boy Next Door, which the best in the series."
4,SOMETHING MISSING!,"Boots Randolph was an incredibly talented sax player and I havealways enjoyed hearing his recordings and hearing him play onTV shows, such as the Grand Ole Opry and Hee Haw.This CD is terrific in general but I'm disappointed that twoparticular songs are missing.He charted only 4 titles on Billboard's Top Pop 100 charts(and none on the country charts).""Yakety Sax"" and ""The Shadow Of Your Smile"" are included onthis CD but ""Hey, Mr. Sax Man"" and ""Temptation"" are not.This CD is titled ""The Greatest Hits Of. . . ."" How can theyjustify that by omitting 2 of the 4 songs that charted?For that reason, I give it only 4 stars instead of the 5 thatit would have had with those other two songs included.Oh, well, it's still a good CD."
4,IT's Boots for crying out loud,"This is a perfect intro to Boots and a fond CD of memories. Nothing new, just him and his Sax. I am thankful we have his music."
4,Useful but sometimes difficult,"The ""...for Beginners"" books all provide a fine introduction to their topics, enough to get one started thinking along the right lines at least. This volume is no different. My only complaint is that it is a bit abstruse at times; it may take more than one reading. Alas, this book is the only 'Lacan for beginners' sort of book that I know of, so if you want an introduction to his thought then this is really your only option."
4,Not really a Bowler Hat...,"I ordered several of these hats for a dance team not realizing it is really more of a Fedora, not a Bowler hat. It's difficult to see in the photo, but the hat has ""dimples"" that a fedora would have in the front. A typical bowler is completely rounded and could also considered a ""Derby"" hat. Please understand, I was very pleased with the price and quality of the hats, but unfortunately it wasn't exactly right for me."
4,Girl's adult gangster bowler hat,"My daughter wore this as part of her costume. She told me that it was well packaged, shipped quickly, and is a good quality for lots more parties. It was a little big on her but she was wearing a wig so it worked out great."
3,Loosely wrapped,"I guess the cd was ok as far as listening quality. I gave it to a friend as a gift & she hasn't mentioned anything being wrong with it, but the case of the cd looked used (and I thought I bought it 'new'). Looked like it was wrapped in Saran Wrap & not very securely at that."
2,"No dogfights, just word-fights.","This is a text heavy book of fair to middling aviation art. The text is blah blah rah-rah America, than anything else. And since Handleman does not confine himself to WW I & II, but goes into the modern age, in which there is a lot of hyperbole and searching for some glorious instance in aerial combat. Unfortunately, that ended with World War II, and has not been translated to the modern era, since wars are not being fought by giant industrial powers whose existence is at stake. Although there is a long bio of R.G. Smith, there is only one of his works. Also, you will not find anything by Taylor, Trudigan, and Fellows. The redeeming features are the work of first tier artists Cohen, Dietz, and Kodera, and following them a bevy of tier 2 & 3 artists. So only, buy the deeply discounted copies."
4,Review: The Visual Display of Quantitative Information,"This is a well-written and well presented book. I haven't read it in its entirety, but so fat it has been an excellent read. Very informative."
4,The best for data display; missing how to tie displays in,"Tufte isn't considered the master of this field for nothing; this work debunks a lot of common practices in data display, including use of color, composition of images, and the importance of scales and labels. An excellent grounding is provided in theory about how to effectively present quantitative data, but the practical advice and examples are also comprehensive.The only thing this book was missing for me was how to tie in data display with the rest of a writing -- how to best visually display your data near descriptive text, but get the flow right so that readers will get the most value from it. Of course, you can get some of that information by osmosis merely by reading his beautifully-composed book."
4,Knew of this book and purchased it specifically for inspiration,"My graduate advisor had this book, along with Tufte's other books. They were very intriguing and I always knew I'd try to get my own copies. A source of inspiration for any type of research, not just quantitative."
4,:),"There is some really great advise for making graphs cleaner and easier to understand. The book also has several examples of beautifully created graphics, pretty enough to be a coffee table book! The things I would love to try to take from this book are the golden rule, clearly labeled data, pointing out interesting data points or outliers, and my favorite the Lie Factor."
4,Readable reference,"Very good book about how to display statistics in charts and graphs. I wish there had been more examples of what makes a good graph, but overall it's a great reference for anyone who's looking to make a chart or graph."
2,More cons than pros,"Pros:1. This book is considered by some one of the key books in this field2. It has some great observations on how to detects ""lies"" within charts3. General advices are sound (if a bit obvious): don't use irrelevant marks, shades and hatches; do plot information...4. Some interesting information on history of graphsCons:1. The book is dated. This is the 2001 edition but I am not sure how much updating has happened since the late 1980s.2. Some proposed techniques are peculiar; the author goes way too far into removing what he considers redundant lines: he has a new box plot and a new way to do bar charts that (although contain the same information from a mathematical point of view) will just loose the audience focus, since the audience will spend attention into puzzling out the new graph3. The book is extremely idiosyncratic on what types of charts it covers, and you are likely not find anything of interest to you besides the general advice"
1,Don't buy this book. Buy a book on Visual Statistics.,"I wasted my money on this obsolete book. I truly don't know where these positive reviews are coming from, when the content of the book solely focuses different types of charts, when my 1998 Excel can do a better job plotting a pie chart!Buy this : Visual Statistics: Seeing Data with Dynamic Interactive Graphics (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics) This has the most relevant information for someone who is looking for ways to present data accurately and precisely."
5,It Changed My Outlook for Life,"Though some of the examples of computer graphics are dated, the principles still resonate. This book was recommended to me in the late 80's and is still the major influence in how I think about presenting data. Tufte writes with quick wit and tremendous examples.Buy the book in spite of the title - it belongs on every professional's bookcase."
2,Complicating the complex.,"Edward Tufte prides himself on making very complex information accessible. What he doesn't understand is that the average person can not make sense of convoluted charts and graphs. Not everyone can read 5 pt type and overlapping hairline strokes, making his examples successfully unsuccessful.Tufte's choice of words clearly demonstrates his lack of interest in the ""'average' consumer."" His writing is overly complicated, much too proud and irrelevant. Intimidating is the antithesis of accessible. ""Excessive"" immediately comes to mind.If you are looking for a book from which to copy a few sentences to impress your boss, this book is great. If you are looking for insight into explaining very complex information to a very wide group of people, then steer clear.Thoroughly disappointed.PS - Don't attend his workshops. You may as well go on a ""team-building retreat."""
3,XKCD,"Randal Munroe of XKCD mentioned this book in the alt-text to Blogofractal ([...])""Edward Tufte's 'The Visual Display of Quantitative Information' is a fantastic book, and should be required reading for anyone in either the sciences or graphic design.""I have to agree, as a graphic designer. Plenty of other books can show you how to make information look pretty, but few can show you how to make information readable. Readability first and the pretty will follow."
3,The Ups and Downs of Tufte's Book,"It definitely was interesting and educational to read and see Tufte's presentation on Visual Dispaly of Quantitative Information. He illustrates the good, the bad, and the ugly of graphic displays over the centuries. However, I was hoping to see more examples of current computer graphics that should be emulated in this edition instead of terse comments and skeletal constructs in this area."
3,neat little book on musical improv,This book was okay. I like that it came with a cd and some practical ways you could practice musical improv. I feel like it would be a good precursor to a class on musical improv but certainly doing it alone would not make someone good at musical improv. Just okay.
3,A great overview but not very indepth,"I did enjoy reading this book; the author has a nice style and covers a good range of information. There were several areas in the book where the author pointed to other books for further information that I was hoping would be included in this book, but it is a short and inexpensive introduction to musical improv. The CD really makes it worth getting. It not only demonstrates some of the concepts but also has plenty of tunes to use for practicing your own improv. Perfect for getting you started on musical improv, just realise that you probably will want to pull from other resources as well."
5,"Practical, inspiring and highly, highly readable.","I really couldn't recommend this book highly enough - Michael Pollock is one of those rare people whose genius at what he does is equalled by his genius at teaching it.As an Aussie improviser who has always loved musical improv (but only seen its application limited to the odd 'theatre-sports' style game) reading this book marked a real turning point for me. Not only did it open up my mind to the possibilities of musical improv, but it explained the nuts and bolts of how to do it in a clear and simple way. This book has laid the foundations of how to approach musical improvisation, while igniting my passion for it!The CD is brilliant too, bringing to life the examples in the book and allowing you to put your skills into practice right away.If you're at all interested in musical improv, don't even question it: just buy it now!Jenny Wynter, Australia"
3,A historical thesis,"From the start, the book reads much like a historical thesis. It goes into depth about the family genealogies and backgrounds of Susanna's and her husband's families, as well as detailed accounts of the lives of all their surviving children. It's filled with lots of factual information, dates, and even ruling church and political leaders. There are only about 2 pages of information about Susanna raising her children. Most of the information about her relationships with her children is about after the children left the home and she corresponded with them through letters. If you're looking to do a historical study or similar on Susanna Wesley, this book is packed with information, but if you're looking to do a book report or just wanting to learn more about her and her family life (as I did), I'd look elsewhere."
1,Insulting Garbage,Trying to watch the female actor in this mismash was unbearable. You just want to get out of the room as fast as possible.
3,A woman's point of view.,"I purchased this book immediately after seeing the author on ""The Other Half"". While the author's mannor kind of put me off, his message really hit home with me. His book is an honest look at why marriage isn't working, and it is clearly meant to be directed at both sexes.The book isn't exactly a masterpiece, and I don't agree with the message that marriage should be completely avoided at all costs. However, it has been a good resource for my essays on the _wrong_ reasons to get married. Read it and take the author's advice with a grain of salt I guess.If you can't quite get into this book, try Phillip C. McGraw and his ""Relationship Rescue"" or ""Life Strategies"" books."
5,Very good,"Candid, insightful, well-written, humorous. Recommended for those open-minded enough to appreciate it. I agree with the book entirely.Conversational tone is nice. Not filled with references and footnotes."
1,We're doomed.,"If this fellow's point of view is to be believed, there is no point of hoping for a brighter tomorrow. Totally indicative of the self-absorbed ""Me"" generation. Additionally, it is printed on flimsy paper stock and filled with typos."
2,LOVE the machine. No online community,"The machine itself is fantastic... but, shouldn't be considered for competitive or online racing via Row Pro 3 software (which only supports Concept2). Row Pro is the only rowing software that actually has users racing online daily, with 6-12 races per day. Water Rower has ""We-Row"" which in theory is competent software... but no one uses it, which makes it useless. WaterRower over-sells this software and there ""community"" on their website, but it is non-existent. They have no forums, and no way of connecting with other members. Their driver support for PC's is spotty, and for Mac's - non-existent. The software is a complete mess.The rower machine is great though. I wish I didn't have to sell it, but due to the limited ability to use it online and in competition environments, it doesn't matter how good it is, it's worthless to me."
5,Excellent piece of equipment,"Shipment was exceptionally quick (the factory is in our state).Setup took app. 30 minutes using the included Allen wrench. Starter supply of chlorine tablets is included, you will need to make additional purchases of those to keep the tank water free of algae ( bleach cannot be used ).Stores upright in very little space, although obviously the ceiling must be higher than the length of the device to do this.The rower has been in daily use for app. 1 month. Smooth and quiet action.No negatives to note at this time."
4,Easily understood version in a compact package.,"The Good News Bible, second edition, is an easily understood account of the life and times of Jesus and his followers. One cannot say more than that. This is a great gift for young and old. Maybe you are just looking for an alternate version to supplement your bible study - this is the bible for you. In addition, this paperback edition is compact and very portable."
3,good value,"Easy to understand, great value compared to hard back Bibles, my only comlaint is the pages are tissue paper like thin."
2,The Feel Good Bible,"This bible is for people that want to take Christianity more lightly. One example is Matthew 4:17. ""Then Jesus started preaching, 'Turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven will soon be here.'""Compare to the King James Version or the Revised Standard Version:""From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.""Well, this is quite a difference! The original Greek word is ""Repent"" (metanoeite) &#61472; Is this the same as ""Turn back to God!""?Possibly, some of the Good News according to this version is that you do not have to repent."
3,Taken too much out of context.,Jeremiah 9:4 for all relatives are as deceitful as JacobIs the translation correct? Please get back to me at maripaen.eddiah@mailcity.comThank you.
4,Modern Army Combatives Level I,"First of all, while there may be a similarity, this is not MMA. For those military personnel who are deploying, and need your level I, I can recommend it just because there are so many moves, I have had a hard time remembering all of them, and I have taken the class at least once a year. With that in mind, I felt it was worth the money. Beware that rumor has it the Army is moving away from ground fighting, but never the less, there are some good moves in here that can be very useful, especially if you like to mixmatch techniques."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"The clear layer of the face plate is quite thick and bulky, and not the easiest to remove from the dark grey faceplate. The paper isn't glossy, but the fact that the plastic is, makes it more difficult to see the designs than it should be.The paper itself is thick, and has slotted cuts everywhere so that it can mold to the shape of the faceplate, the pieces removed for all of the different slots are oversized and a good deal of the grey faceplate will show through.I can't reccomend this product unless you're willing to go with the very cheapest vendors.(I got mine for like 5$, so it's no huge loss). It's a case of getting what you pay for I suppose.As far as customizing a 360 face plate, Decalgirl would be the way to go, with nice glossy vinyl coverings. They even do custom jobs, faceplate, controller, and both the other sides of the XBOX, plus, if you do a custom job and they want to use it in their store, they'll give you a freebie."
2,Not worth $20,"This thing is so not worth the $20 you will be forking over. The paper quality is very cheap. So when you print things out, even with the best of the best printer, the result will look very dull and pretty much not as great as you would get off $10 TSZ face plates.Also note that the plastic cover that is required to tighten the paper used for the design will hinder any type of verticle stand and keep it from being ""fit"". Also, the plastic has small side plastic tabs that will not keep your 360 flat horizontally."
2,what the heck is this?,"its a skin for a faceplate. i mean i could get the same faceplate for 20 bucks. + anyone who looks at it once goes all like huh? please amazon and lower the price man, or woman or anyone running amazon."
2,Cheapo Product,"Tested several new electrolytic caps and readings were all off. Suspect that this isn't the most accurate way to test, and any serious user would be better off with something a little more professional. Other review must have been written by manufacturer's rep or distributor. Bad English a giveaway."
4,If you're looking for the Canadian hard rock band here...,"This isn't the band from Oshawa Ontario, fronted by powerful lead singer Harry hess and guitarist extraordinaire Pete Lesperance, but another band from halfway around the world with a completely different sound which, if your tastes are diverse and eclectic, is every bit as enjoyable! I wasn't aware of this particular band several years back when I ordered one of their albums on eBay, thinking Harry and the boys had a couple of releases I wasn't aware of...imagine MY surprise when it arrived and I opened the package. Still, fine music to enjoy and quite catchy and infectious!"
1,A rip-off of the complete score,"This is another example of the music industry trying to get the consumer to invest in the purchase of multiple soundtrack albums of the same movie. I bought this album because of my curiousity in the track listing (of which there are 10 tracks listed). I already have another CD in my collection -- also titled ""RAMBO III: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"", but it contains 23 tracks instead of 10 and has a different jacket cover. If you are a fan of the ""Rambo"" music or like the compositions of Jerry Goldsmith, you probably aren't going to be happy with this CD. Although Amazon doesn't list the 23 track ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"" like I have, you might want to best spend your dollars at an auction site or ""rare"" web sites that offer the complete version."
2,Rambo III soundtrack,"With only a few exceptions, this soundtrack fails to capture the spirit which was presented in Rambo ""II"", lacking the musical depth and intensity captured in previous Rambo soundtracks. In stark contrast, when listening to the soundtrack from II, you could almost see the movie and feel the energy from the visual by just listening to the tracks. While III is well done in it's own right, it doesn't convey the same stimulus to the imagination. It seems, however, to leave one with the same question that the viewer is left with after seeing the movie: ""did we really need this last installment of the Rambo saga?"""
2,Shipping higher than labels!,"These labels are nice, but I highly recommend searching for other external label sites. You can get a wider variety of labels--even personalized labels, and spend less than the options currently provided on Amazon."
2,"Kitchen Aid Jam Labels - 2"" circular","Colorful label, will not hold lazer jet ink, which parts of flake off when peeling or applying to the jar. It is printed on a coated stock, which is why the ink dends to flake. I have been having to spray a clear laquer on the label sheet after printing, so I can get 13 or 15 labels applied to the jar. Maybe it would work with an ink jet printer, haven't tried that. Also, an expensing label, per piece."
4,Good buy and happy with watch,"The watch was as good as advertised. Not worried about warranty issues, because it comes with the standard 1 year warranty. Save a ton of money on the watch."
5,Sylish watch,"Ilove this watch. Been looking at it for a long time and found a great price on Amazon so I took the plunge. It is sporty, yet dressy."
4,"Generous portion, quality product",This is a very potent sage. Just a little bit works for a whole house. I was pleased with the quantity and quality. Would use company again.
2,Wrong cursive style for my Nine-year old,I could not get enough details about the style used in this book. It happened to be all wrong and different to how my nine year old had learned to write.
4,"Excellent compilation, some organizational problems","Big Jim's Motor Black Book is a compilation of advice written by Jim Greenemeyer on various web forums over the past several years. Hank Hagquist compiled, organized and published the information in this paperback volume. Big Jim covers all kinds of tricky questions about RC car motors -- timing, brush selection, comm cutting, gearing selection, maintenance and cleaning, etc.My only criticism: the book is fairly disorganized, despite Hank's noble attempts to impose order on it. It's a collection of chatty, first-person essays loosely organized into titled chapters. At times it can be difficult to follow, and more reference information would be welcome for RC novices. However, there is a tremendous amount of valuable information here for the RC car performance enthusiast, and it is not available in compiled form anywhere else."
2,Sexy Stella Stevens rules so so movie,"If you're a fan of beautiful sexy underated Stella Stevens then get this just to see her at her prime. But dont expect much from the movie itself, middling, lame story, and actually quite boring, and once again proves that Stevens was much better than the material offered to her."
3,Good for 5 year then leaks,"Similar review: work great a 5 years , but plastic at reel connection breaks and leaks. Unable to repair."
1,The plastic frame broke,"I mounted on the side of the house and it was perfect for pulling the hose out to the front of my house. But Two years later I see the back FRAME broke and it is barely hanging on the wall.It was only used it 1-2 times a month and the part that broke is behind the wheel which means UV ray damage was probably not the issue.I Cannot believe that in 2 years I have thrown out BOTH suncast reels (read my other review on the RSH-125)I can't believe we are filling up the landfills THIS QUICKLY. I am just a Joe homeowner and I have chucked 2 hosereels in the trash in 2 years.Go with Metal - Buy once, Cry once."
3,2nd one the last one lasted 10 yrs or so,"I bought the same one that I had before witch broke on the top mounting bolt, repaired that with plumbers tape [the steel kind] ,with sheet metal screws,lasted the last 2 yrs.Mounted on brick home I used 1/4"" concrete molly's didn't what to change the mounting so I ordered the same one that I had."
2,LEAKS AND NO PARTS,"I've had this for four years. It leaked from day one. Finally took it down to see if I could fix it. The replacement part from Suncast costs 64 cents but the shipping is $9.50. On a 4 year old item, replacing the part doesn't make sense. Since this hose is right next to my front door, I have to have some sort of reel. I'll look elsewhere."
1,Warped spindle,"I received this item with a severely warped spindle. Did not want to hassle with returning and used the spindle I had from my old one with the broken base. So, basically I paid for just a new base. Cannot believe the QC people did not catch this. Also the hose for connecting this to the water spout is too short to be useful."
1,Not Good in Florida Sun,"I have 2 of these units. Both have broken off the wall after only 2 years. The plastic cannot take the Florida sun, hardens and becomes brittle. I did not have the hose connection problems as others have had. Plastic is not good in the sun!"
2,"Cheap plastic cracks easily, and NO warranty from Suncast","First, you should note neither the box nor the printed instructions from Suncast contain a warranty because there is no warranty. I called Suncast and was told that they warrant that the reel is not defective at time of purchase only. If anything breaks, you need to buy a replacement part which, when you add shipping, will cost you the same amount as a whole new unit.Second, the way this unit is constructed, the cheap plastic will break, either from the weight of the hose or from the force of pulling on the hose to unwind it.Therefore, I suggest you look elsewhere for a well made hose reel."
2,Won't hold a full 100 ft. hose,"I spent 90 minutes anchoring this reel on my stone wall, and then when I tried it with my 100 ft. hose, the top bent a bit off the wall so the reel wouldn't spin properly. Weak plastic.,"
2,Suncoast ST100 side tracker wall mount hose reel,This hose reel seemed quick flimsy and cheap made. It came with a warped reel and is hard to roll the hose up. We have had several other Suncoast hose reels in the passed and have been VERY satisfied with them. Are they just making everything cheaper these days????
3,O.K. for the money,"I bought this unit more than 3 years ago and it served its purpose for the $30 or so it cost. I had to use different mounting screws with washers to avoid the problem of having it pull away from the wall (through the plastic) with the weight of the hose. While it states 100-foot hose fits, my experience is it holds a 90' hose or less (the last 10' did not spool well). Recently, the reel began to leak internally. After taking it apart, I'm not sure if the o-rings are the problem or if there is a crack I can't find. I will be purchasing another reel rather than trying to fix this one.Overall - any plastic, wall-mounted reel is prone to these issues. The question is how much are you willing to pay for the convenience of a reel. Mounting a rack is cheaper and will last nearly forever, but you have to coil the hose yourself."
4,Great product.,"This is a great piece for the money, the only thing is that it works better up to a 75 foot hose, not the 100 as they say."
1,Will last one season!,"I wish Amazon, Lowe's, Meijer's and the other chains would carry all steel reels with brass fittings and a quality baked enamel finish. My parent's steel reel lasted 20+ years. The threaded plastic connector failed on my reel and now water sprays in all directions. I can't find a steel model anywhere, including the internet. Will probably revert to a simple wall mounted hose hanger."
2,"Lasts for a few months, then breaks","The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100' hose full of water. The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose. Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year. This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk. I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price. It looks like it will work forever. Also, this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8"" hose. It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft. If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a quality reel the first time."
1,second year,"Product works fine no trouble with it the first year, this spring the first time I turned on the water it leaked like a down pour. The rubber O rings had dried out. No problem I thought right. Just run over to the hardware or Home Depot and pick up two .20 cent O rings. Ha I have been to Home Depot, hardware stores, auto parts, plumbing supply ect. No one has the .20 cent O rings to fix this product. So you have a big leak or go buy a new hose reel !"
2,A little too small,"While it may well hold 100 feet of 5/8"" hose, your garden hose is likely bigger than 5/8"". Our hose is 1"" in size and thus we were disappointed to find that this reel is not big enough to hold all of the hose."
3,Needed to Fix it.,"This item worked well the first year. But after year #1 the assembly part that you attach your hose to failed. It is a tube with a plastic plug in the end. Well...the plug pushed out of the end of the tube caused by the water pressure. I tried to glue it with Gorilla Glue(TM), but it only held up for a day before popping out again. I finally put the plug in and drilled a hole through the outside wall of the tube and the plug while it was in place. I then slid an opened paper clip through the tiny hole to lock it in place. Then I filled the tube cavity with silicone to seal the tube. It has held up so far. What a pain. I did like the easy crankability and how easily the hose tracks onto the reel."
1,NOT a Squirrel,"This item is not for the squirrel, which they apparently no longer carry even though they've got it listed for sale. They will send you a beaver which is much lower quality than the item I reordered (supposed to be the squirrel). It took entirelypets.com (the seller) 4 days to generate a return shipping label and three weeks later I have yet to receive my refund."
3,Dead in record time,"Not as ""chew-worthy"" as previous Kong squeeker dog toys. This one lasted about 10 minutes with our mini dachshund. A joyful 10 minutes, but still just 10."
1,bait and switch,"I ordered 3 squirrels, because the one I bought before is the only stuffed toy my Lab didn't tear all the stuffings out of it on the first hour. She actually sleeps with it between her paws. It's getting pretty dirty, so I wanted to replace it. This company sent me 3 beavers. You can't trust them to fill their order properly."
2,Don't Bother,"The only positive thing I can say about this toy is that there was no messy stuffing to be spread all over the house and eaten. This toy was torn apart the first day. My dog tried to eat one of the legs she got free from the toy...yikes! I don't see why they give you replacement squeakers...this toy is torn up the first day and with all the holes your dog makes in the squirrel, the squeaker pouch won't stay in. All in all, don't bother with this toy."
5,WONDERFUL IDEA!,"This unstuffed, but plush dog toy, is a huge hit with MOM and the KIDS. I finally was able to throw away the pile of their toys that needed mending for the umteenth time. They play with it individually and tug-o-war together. The added extra of several squeakers was a wonderful surprise. AMAZON.com...You Rock!"
4,Nice toy but sheds fur!,"My four-month-old Labrador Retriever simply loves this toy, but she manages to pull out (and sometimes swallow) tufts of fur from the squirrel's tail whenever she plays with it. I'm not sure if the culprit is poor manufacturing or the excessive zeal of a teething puppy! The toy washes extremely well in the washing machine, the velcro patch keeps the squeaker nicely concealed, and I especially like the fact that the toy came with four replacement squeakers."
1,The small version of this toy is about the size of a mouse.,"This toy has rav reviews, so I was all over. NOT! I received teeny tiny package in it a teeny tiny reddish thing on cardboard. No stuffing I could just feel the squeaker. Velcro, so your pup can take OUT the squeaker if they are clever enough. (Mine is). Now I have a 13lb playful pup, she makes up games with everything and cherishes her toys. I presented it to her and she just looked at me like WHAT IS THAT, MOM? That COULD NOT BE A TOY. Squeaking did not help it was limp and lifeless on the floor. I put the ""xtra"" squeaker in it to make it a little more interesting as there was not much too this tiny mouse size toy.... Don't get the buzz, waste of my hard earned cash! Just be careful with that velcro, in my opinion it's totally unnecessary, get Coleman toys is you want a toy that last."
4,one of the better stuffed toys,"My black lab loves toys, especially stuffed ones that he can chew open. Most with a squeaker are chewed open in 5 - 10 minutes. This one lasted over 15 before I removed it myself. I like the fact that it has heavy velcro holding it closed so you can open it up remove the squeaker or put the inner lining back in. The fleece inner stuffing is a lot better than the polyfill that gets all over. He still loves the toy even though its pretty ragged. Its mostly in one piece. I wish it was even tougher but I haven't seen anything better."
4,More durable than other stuffed toys,"Length:: 0:22 MinsMy Jack Russell Terrier wants to catch a squirrel so bad, so I decided to try this squirrel toy because it is made by Kong. I was happy to find that, unlike any other stuffed animals that have entered the house, the Kong squirrel was not ripped to shreds in under 60 seconds. My boy loves it! The only issue I had with the toy itself is that the tail fur is pretty easy to pull out, and that was the only destructive thing Jack tried to do to it. It barely squeaked at all...if you are worried about the annoying squeak, the squeaker seems not to be in a place for a small-medium dog to squeak it very easily. Of course, a great thing about this toy is that you can remove and replace the squeakers. This squirrel lives up to Kong's reputation for making things sturdier. I was not disappointed. The biggest danger to Mr. Squirrel is that the other 2 dogs want to take him away from Jack and it's definitely not an ideal tug toy."
2,Hairy Mess,"Kong usually has great dog toys. This one does not make the grade. For over a week I was picking up squirrel hair fuzzies off the carpet, fishing it out of the dogs mouth, and generally annoyed with the mess it made everywhere. I finally cut the tail off since I did not want a vet bill for a hairball stuck in my dog's stomach. KONG needs to rethink this toy big time."
2,Cute but not long lasting,"This Kong toy was super cute and my guys loved it (two medium sized Australian Shepards), but as with most soft toys didn't last 20 minutes. I was hoping with a Kong stuffed type toy it would last with my aggressive chewers, but it didn't. As was said before, thank goodness there was little clean up. It did come with extra squeakers I've been putting in other things to provide a good ""hunt"" for the boys!"
5,Kong toy,"The dog (newfoundland) is relentless when it comes to tearing out the squeaker in the toy, but so far the toy has held up"
1,No match for Australian Shepherd,It only took our two year old Australian Shepherd a day to demolish this toy.
2,Cut off the tail,The pup was choking on tufts of tail fur immediately upon purchase. Lopped off the tail to salvage the purchase and the dog. Not nearly as well made and durable as Dr. Noy's frog. Will not purchase again.
2,Cute but not strudy,My dog loved the squirrel but destroyed it within an hour. The extra squeakers serve no purpose when there isn't enough of the toy left into which to put them.
3,Not tough enough.,"I gave this to our Australian Shepherd, Emma for Christmas 2012. She loves it but quickly tore it apart, pulled out the squeaker holder and tore that apart, too. I have 3 more squeakers but will have to figure out another way for her to play with them. She still plays with both pieces though. I had hoped that with the Kong brand it would have held up better."
1,Gone in 60 seconds,Dog destroyed this in less than a minute and we had to throw it away. Not exactly what I'd expect from Kong.
2,Okay,My lab was able to chew a hole in this toy. She was able to rip out the squeaker and squeaker pouch. Would not purchase again.
1,SO cute!,The squrriel was such a cute toy for our 7 month old Lab. It lasted about 15 minutes and was in pieces. The good thing is that there was a limited amount of stuffing.
3,Good for awhile,My dog was able to get the squeaker out and destroyed the pouch that house the squeaker in no time. He did like it while it lasted.
3,It made it past the three week period!,"Our part Airedale Terrier, part Border Collie is pretty rough on toys. She usually plays with the stuffed type toys for a week or so and then guts them ripping out the stuffing. When the squirrel arrived I was a little unsure of the tail. But she has had it for three weeks now and has not ripped into it yet. She has played with it for hours at a time. So far, this is one of the best stuffed toys we have found."
3,not tough enough,"I was excited to find Dr Noy's Dog Toys as I had heard good things about their durabillity. However, it took no time at all for my 8-month old golden/spaniel cross to rip them apart...literally withing minutes. As a consequence, I would not buy them again...I will purchase less expensive toys for him to shred. I do think they would be wonderful for dogs who like to cuddle their animals."
3,Our baby nis tough on toys,Great toy for normal play. Our dog will gnaw on his for hours until we find little pieces of fur all over. He loves it.
3,Don't know,"My GSD took it outside and buried it, found it once then he took it and buried it again. One day we will find it and give a review."
4,For patient viewers,"The Bottom Line:There's no getting around the fact that The Garden of the Finzi-Continis often moves at a glacial pace, but if you stick with it until the ending it might be able to move you too; a different style of Holocaust story than I'm accustomed to and one told with intelligence, it's a movie I'm glad I watched even though I never want to watch it again.3/4"
4,"A gorgeous film, but with a new ending","This is a lovely film, moving and subtle. BUT this version has a new coda tacked on to it that I'd never seen before. I have no idea where it came from, or who authorized it, but it is grotesque, compared to the ending of the original film."
2,Why is this so great?,"It is politically correct, perhaps, to call any work dealing with the Holocaust great just because it deals with the subject, maybe because one fears the charge of anti-Semitism. I suspect that's the major reason this film has built a reputation. But this is NOT a great film. Like many period pieces dealing with aristocrats, it's a stately bore. The plot and character development take forever to build any steam. Just when you begin to care about the characters -- the movie ends. Or, more accurately, just stops, dead in in tracks, not a single plotline resolved. Characters just disappear along the way, randomly, with no dramatic impact. I wondered if they chopped away the last third of the film by accident when I rented it. It is beautifully photographed, but way too detached from it's subject matter until it's too late. In the end, too frustrating to be entertaining or thought-provoking."
4,"After 30 years, it's still a remarkable film","I saw this film in its initial release in the early 70s, when there were lots of outstanding, intelligent, and personal films around. It made a deep impression then, and it holds up. The haunting mise-en-scene, the interaction and personalities of the characters, the involvement of the writing all still exercise a strong pull on the viewer. But foremost is Dominique Sanda: she was beguiling and mysterious then and she continues to exercise this hold. And I'm finally able to see it in its original format. I'm sorry there's so little additional material on the DVD, but the quality of DeSica's vision of his country at an unhappy time is immensely powerful."
4,Excellent Book for the Korean Cooking Newcomer,"While I was in College friends introduced me to Korean food, and I have been hooked ever since. As a non-Asian, I had never been exposed to this type of food growing up and knew little about the ingredients. This books is great! It gives clear color pictures (instead of b/w drawings) of the individual ingredients needed, concise measurements and step-by-step directions. I have been able to locate all needed ingredients at my local asian food store and have been much surprised that things have actually worked out and tasted good. I highly recommend this book for the beginner!!"
1,Japanese point of view,"In the list of ingredients there are Japanese names that are not used by Korean people. Besides, explanations of ingredients include too many references to Japanese influence. There should be some words for Chinese influence as well as the appropiate conditions of Korean climate to cultivate some of the products and the adaptation of these products to Korean style.The author says that ""most of the recipes contained in this book have been adapted to Western style"". It is true.Excellent pictures but finally unuseful if you want real Korean recipes."
1,Not so healthy,"After having looked over the recipies in this book I would discourage you from using it. There is too much MSG in this book. It isn't healthy for you nor is it necessary in korean cooking. I am a korean american and grew up eating and learning korean food. I am looking for a good cookbook to supplement the cooking taught to me by my mother. My mother always told me that using MSG in foods is cheating and it is not good for your health. Not to mention that food cooked w/MSG tends to have a funny msg taste. Also, some people have very bad reactions to msg. so please either stay away from this cookbook.. or leave the msg out of the recipies"
2,Japanese-style Korean food,"This book has clear (if dated) photos, relatively straightforward recipes (although there are many obvious spelling and grammatical errors), and there's a very helpful section about Korean etiquette and table settings in the back.But it's a strange hybrid: it's a Japanese take on Korean food for the Western palate. The recipes are not exactly authentic, they are filtered through the Japanese worldview of what Westerners want. And it clearly needed to be run through an editor, as some sentences make no sense at all and some of the instructions are far from clear.It's hard to recommend this book for the idiosyncratic recipes, unless you are interested in making Korean food like a Japanese housewife from the 80s."
3,not made for US market?,"Great pictures, wonderful instructions, great recipes.The book is in English, but seems to be made for use in the Japanese market, citing Japanese measurements, and often listing Japanese brands or products to use in the preparation. Does not seem to be geared toward the ingredients or brands available in North America."
1,Faulty product,"I was excited to get the docking station but to my surprise it does not function properly. The only function working is the video jack...the power,usb's for my remote mouse and printer will not run. Very dissappointed."
2,you don't need it,"To save yourself some money on this stuff, just use STP cut with a little 30 wt motor oil in your oil squirt can. Works better.Use the same mixture for your chain saw bar oil, too"
2,Used for lubricating ratchets.,"Lots of people purchase this product as a ratchet lubricant. My review pertains ONLY to that use. While it smooths out the ratchet considerably, it does ooze quite a bit, leaving red gooey stuff all over the box or drawer--thus the lowered rating for a ratchet lube. I no longer use this product for ratchets; I use a competing product based on lithium grease."
3,Thorough research; fuzzy pictures,"Mr. Loudon did a nice job describing the life and demise of this large D&H roundhouse, including interesting historical anecdotes such as the spectacular coal dock fire. As such, it's a unique and thorough report of his original research. Unfortunately, poor photo reproduction quality drove down my rating - the book has the appearance of being photocopied on the office Xerox copier. Hard to make out any details of the building construction from these pictures. It's a shame the author did not have access to a high-quality scanner."
3,Not what I expected,"Eventhough the book might be good, it is not as easy and as friendly as I expected. It has only text, without any graphics nor ideas, so you must have plenty of time to read it before implementing something."
4,BIG,This chest is even bigger than I expected ! Bought it for my sons scuba gear storage. It held everything with room to spare. I planned to buy another but our KB home has the smallest garages imaginable and this takes up a LOT of space.Easy to assemble and sturdy. Have not tried to move it yet so I can't speak about the wheels. Will buy one or two of it's smaller cousins soon.I should be able to eliminate my $57 a month storage rental fees soon.
4,like it,The box is great. It was difficult to snap together. Need some serious strength. Plenty of room and everything is staying dry.
4,Deck Box,"I shopped around and couldn't find a large deck box. The ones I saw sold in the stores only hold 4 cushions. This was a great price for the size. My six cushions do squeeze in there, so I'm happy with it."
1,Deck Box,"This box is not of good quality. The quality has deteriorated from our previous Deck Box by the same manufacturer. However, we are using it and it looks nice."
1,Extremely difficult to assemble,This product is not engineered to assemble well. The panels cannot be pressed together as indicated. This product is an embarrassment to American engineering and that is shameful. Two adults weighing 170 lbs. each could not press pieces together. Suncast tried to produce a product cheaply resulting in a flawed design which will be returned.
2,"Cheaply made, Doesn't Roll","Bought 3 of these and was pleased to see Made In USA on the box. I was very disappointed in the quality however. No tools are required for assembly but we found them hard to assemble with fist pounding. One corner shattered before popping into place. The wheels spun just fine before the end pieces were attached but when assembled they wouldn't roll at all. We tried cutting away the parts of the joining tabs that slide into place against the wheels but it didn't help. None of the 3 deck boxes' wheels roll. So I consider these boxes cheap pieces of plastic junk that I'm just going to use, abuse, and throw into a landfill like a good little American consumer."
1,Not Water Proof!!!,"Got a new patio (not a porch) poured last summer and decided to buy new deck boxes... At the end of the season I put my patio cushions in it along with other items. Just opened the boxes today. and the entire bottom was full of water...about 3"" and EVERYTHING is moldy and ruined! I am currently looking for rubbermade containers... When it seems to good to be true, it probably is...Suncast deckbox with wheels and a seat on top: $50Value of contents inside: $200Rubbermade Container: Priceless!"
4,Good and Bad,"Attractive box, lid attachment holes not so good. Closure tab needs inprovement. I hope it stays shut in the wind. Wheels only work well on concrete and are only on one side. Got my box today in great time, to replace an old Rubbermaid storage box. Three of the hinge holes on the lid were cracked. I called Suncast and they are sending a new lid at no cost. Even with the hinge holes cracked it was really hard to get the lid attached at the hinges. As one person wrote, you need lots of patience to get it on right...so true. Others should check to make sure the hinge hole tabs didn't crack while attaching the lid. Other than that I'm pleased with the purchase, and would recommend it to others but, would caution them when attachig the lid. TAKE YOUR TIME and don't crack the hole tabs. Oleshoeleather"
2,Dissapointed,Definitly too small to store cushions - I have the smaller version as well and there really isn't much difference between the two except for the price - I was sorry I bought this - I was extremely dissapointed - I wouldn't have been happy with this item at a lower price but the expense makes it even worse.
3,Quality has taken a nose dive,"We liked our first Suncast Deck Box so much we ordered a second one a couple of years later. Sad to say, the quality has gone down hill in the time between orders. Both boxes were easy to assemble, but the newest one has a number of flaws. For example, the front edge of the top is quite thin and has several chunks missing. It's not enough to warrant going through the hassle of trying to return something this bulky and won't (I hope) diminish its usefulness, but it's a glaringly obvious cosmetic flaw that we will notice each time we open of close the box.Disappointing. More like 2.5 stars."
5,Great Item,I'm using the Deck box on my patio to hold chair cushions. I know that they are safe and dry from sun and rain damage. And they are just a step away from the chair in time of use.Great size also. Terry in Ohio
3,ASSEMBLY CHALLENGES,"I just purchased this item from Amazon for $20 more than it is now listed for. The main assembly was hard enough for one woman, but I finally got all in place except the lid. After much effort I finally had to call a very ""handy man"" friend. He couldn't believe the design as there is no give for the lid to pop down into place onto the hard/solid pegs....it is solid on solid. So he actually had to shave away parts of the pegs and release the support pieces to create some give......after much time, it finally snapped into place. It should not take that much effort or modification of the product to get the lid on. The comments on Amazon have clearly reflected the difficulty for some time now with no change from Suncast. It is definately a design flaw that needs to be corrected."
4,Great storage box,"This storage box was a great buy and looks nice for being made of plastic. You will have to put this together, but for the most part it's pretty straight forward. I did make the mistake of putting one piece on backwards and it was a pain to get it apart to correct.Pros- Easy to assemble- Very sturdy- Nice looks and color for molded plastic.- Protability is nice featureCons- Too light when empty. It would be nice if there was a way to put sand to keep in place.- Top door does not latch or lock shut."
4,A Decent Purchase,"This sword isn't the very best of all of my purchases made, however I am pleased with the purchase none the less. The sheath is made of medal and what appears to be plastic with a wooden look to it. Also like I've seen in many reviews the chain looks as if it could possibly break but I am not planning on using it as much more than an addition to my collection. The sword is beautiful, a little longer than the picture makes it look, but the description length is dead on. The grip is made of the same materials as the sheath but it is very sturdy. It is a beautiful piece and I would recommended it to anyone who isn't too serious of a collector. But over all it is very nice and I am satisfied with this purchase."
5,intellectual and great,"I am french, and Huis Clos is one of the most importants books i read when i was a teenager, looking for truth about adult behavior... It's really intellectual, but not artificial, and makes you think a lot about what is going on between people, and what you learned growing up."
3,Hell is up to the imagination.,"""Huis Clos"" is one of the few books that actually illustrates a version of hell. Most people wouldn't think to write about such a touchy subject. Likewise, most people accept the typical hell full of fire and torture chambers as what it will be like. Few contemplate the possibility that it might be different, as well as refuse to think about what else it could be. This book made me think about it a little more than I imagined. What if having to be around the same two people for eternity really is hell? What if hell was based on the individual? My personal hell would be eternity on a stair-master. And the only music would be Michael Bolton...karaoke-style."
4,Just what I needed,"I needed an other adapter plate so I could change quickly to my lens that is lens mounted, requiring me to stop take the plate off the camera and put it on the lens. It took so much time I would just not use the bigger lens. Now I can switch easily, saving a lot of time and effort. Now if I could just get the quick release to work properly."
2,big a bulky,"don't waste your money on these quick releases. purchase ones from ""Really Right Stuff"" (with head base plate) and you will have the best in size, weight and usability.)These are very clumsy to work with and there is better on the market."
4,Excellent item for photogs,"Having spare quick-release plates allows me to not have to worry about changing plates from camera bodies to telephoto lenses, etc. I can buy as many as I need and not have to change. Manfrotto/Bogen rocks!"
3,The Diabetes Cure Review,"Book was really out of date when it came to the facts it represented in the book (published in 1999). Not sure that the current thought agrees with the use of the supplement as effective for dealing with diabetes. However, the principles of low carbohydrates, exercise, etc. are timeless and very helpful to the newly diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. Seller was great on sending it on time."
4,Australian Marine Life-REVIEW,"This book contains information on most if not all species of marine life in Australia particualy, southern Australia. It contains all the phylum genus and species information as well as location and size. A very good referrence book for anyone interested in Australian Marine life."
2,Inefficient,"Has no effect on me and my 3 years old child, probably has some effect on my wife. Also, the image of 4oz bottle is wrong: actually it is the image of 2 oz bottle with dropper, 4oz bottle has no dropper."
4,Good stuff,My 3 year old is very hyper..to the point where he will likely be diagnosed ADD. When I give him this stuff he does calm down a couple notches but still does get into crazy stints.It tastes good which was a pleasant bonus.
3,works for awhile...giving false hope,"We tried this about a month ago. Worked AWESOME after about 10 days. Completely changed my almost 4 year old son. Daycare said it was like night and day. Unfortunately, It just gave me false hope. He reverted after about 8 good days at school (a total of 3 weeks or so on the liquid). Now I am trying to see if I can find something else that will work...maybe a combo...I just don't know."
5,"Thank you, God.","I'll leave this simple, for those with kids with ADHD and the like:This syrup is the difference between a kicking, screaming fight to do the slightest thing, and complaining a little bit about doing something."
2,"Brings 'em down a ""notch"".","My 5 year old son is an all over the place kind of boy. Very fidgety. Since giving him the syrup - 3 times a day - for almost a month now I've noticed the difference.I'll put it this way. I would rate his ""fidgety""-ness BEFORE the syrup on a scale of 1 to 10 as a 10. Since taking calm child I'd say he's about a 6.5While he is still quite himself, I've noticed he's come down a notch.It's not the miracle cure I was hoping for, but it sure has helped.[edit/jan2011] - Three months have passed and well, he's regressed and the syrup doesn't seem to be working anymore. Not even adjusting the dosage has helped."
2,"Lovely, but then they shred...",Lovely set for the first few months but then the bottom sheet starts to shred. Notice this same comment from people who rate the set after having it for several months. I have never has sheets that shred in this way even after years.
2,"awful polyester feel, hot","These sheets were nice and big--fit our king size bed well. However, even though the label says they are 100% cotton, they feel like 100% polyester-very slippery. After a few washings they began to pill and became worn in spots. Also, they don't seem to breathe and made us very hot. After several nights of waking up soaked in sweat we threw them away."
4,Good deal!,"I think these sheets are a nice texture. They aren't slippery but they aren't like flannel either. I don't find them itchy at all. We've washed them twice since we bought them, no pills yet! The only reason I give them 4 out of 5 is because they are a little big. We have a tempurpedic mattress (18"") and the sheets are a little loose. They don't come off the mattress, just can't get a tight fit!"
4,Comfy Sheets !,"I bought these sheets in a Calif. King size about 4 months ago. We have an older mattress so these sheets don't fit as tightly as they would on a newer thicker mattress, but no bother. They feel so luxurious, different than any sheets I've ever had. In fact we ooohed and aaahed every night for about a week when it was time to slip into bed. Usually during colder months I switch to a flannel sheet because the plain cotton ones seem so cold. These sheets, however, are NOT flannel but they are not cold when first getting into bed. They launder well and after some washings, I wouldn't say they're wrinkle free but they have less wrinkles than regular sheets. My purpose in buying them was to have the 600 thread count and a set of Calif. King sheets which were affordable. The wrinkle free aspect was secondary to me.I really enjoy these sheets !"
4,Really Nice Sheets,"We went to a B&B; that had really nice sheets - 500 or 600 thread count, no-wrinkle, sateen finish - and commented on the sheets. I guess other people had commented as well because the innkeeper actually sold sheet sets - she got them from some innkeeper supply place - but they were very expensive. So I did an online search and found these sheets at a much better price - and bought them as a Christmas present for my wife.They are nice - they feel very smooth, are fairly heavy fabric, and when we washed and dried them before using they came out of the dryer really close to wrinkle free - a world of difference from some 400 count cotton sheets we have (though those aren't wrinkle free). We have a fairly deep mattress - and they fit just fine - plus the pillow cases are very generous - no jamming your pillow into these cases! We've only used them once, and so we can't say anything about longevity, etc. - but so far we're very pleased. We may never use our old sheets again."
5,Sheets,"This is the 2nd set of these sheets that I have purchased. For the price, they are awesome. I never have to iron and they feel great against my skin. My dog loves them too!"
3,A Disappointment,"I ordered these sheets thinking 600 thread count had to be soft and wrinkle free too at a good price--too good to be true. Well most things too good to be true are just that. The sheets are not softer than the the average decent lower thread count sheet. The only difference is they are super thick (which feels a little strange) and very oversized(I have a deep queen mattress and these were still too big) As for wrinkle free--there is a note that says something like ""remove from dryer promptly as soon as dry and put directly on bed"" Well most sheets will remain wrinkle free if we could always do that. If they don't go directly from dryer to bed they are not wrinkle free although the big thickness does help them not be super wrinkled. I gave 3 stars only because they have not pilled (perhaps because they are not soft), colors were nice, and they are not bad compared to my regular sheets, but if you are trying to splurge on 600 thread count pay more and get what you really want."
2,Nice feel; bad fit,"It is true, these sheets do not wrinkle and they feel nice; but the fit is terrible. The sheets are so oversized you cannot get a good fit on the bottom sheet. We have a pillow top mattress that is 19 inches thick and still the sheets did not fit. Two of our pillows would fit in one of the pillowcases. When the sheets arrived, there were several dark blue stains on the bottom sheet. This did not interfere with their use, but it indicates that the manufacturer's quality control program needs upgrading."
2,Comfortable but fragile,"These sheets are very soft, comfortable and wrinkle-free, but after 6 months, they just shredded apart where out feet rest. While our feet are not perfectly baby-soft, we have never had sheets wear or tear at the feet before. I loved these fragile sheets, but I won't buy them again."
5,Great sheet set,Brougt this 600 count set and a 1000 count set. The 600 count set was far superior. They are soft and smooth. Best of all they are indeed wrinkle free. Wish I had brought two sets instead of the 1000 count set. Can't go wrong with this 600 count sheet set.
3,"Comfortable, but not durable","I bought these sheets the end of December 2006. They are very soft, comfortable, great feeling; however after 7 months, the fitted sheet just shred at the bottom of the sheet (where our feet lay). Top sheet and pillow cases are fine, so I have to find a fitted bottom sheet to go with them now. Even at the discounted price, I expected them to last longer than 7 months."
5,are we all reading the same book?,"I know a reader-review should respond to the book itself, and not the comments of the other reviewers, but this recent batch of negative reviews are so wildly off the mark that they beg correction. I don't know what these readers are thinking, but it seems to me like they either haven't read 'Musca Domestica' or simply lack the faculties to read it fairly.In any case, potential buyers, don't be discouraged by these nonsensical reviews. 'Musca Domestica' is an incredibly rewarding book: the poems are only difficult in the way that the most intriguing and beautiful puzzles are difficult. These poems reward in every way: Ms. Hume manages to be funny and poignant and provoactive and weird all at once, and the more time you spend with this book the more delightful it becomes.Give 'Musca Domestica' a try -- the poems have earned it, and the book will richly repay your attention!And to you 'readers' in the one-star crowd: snap out of it, kids."
1,"""Musca Domestica""","This book is overly concerned with epistemology and as such comes across sounding too studied, too forced, with very little poetic attraction at all. It is forced-sounding with a repetitive housefly imagery throughout the poetry. WHY HOUSEFLIES? The housefly imagery completely takes over and leaves the author with very little room to explore. The poems sound forced and unnatural. The poetry has an identifiable agends that is NOT flexible enough to be important and accessible. This work is ONLY intended for poets or postmodern theorists concerned with not making any sense."
4,Beautiful Earrings,"Bought these for my 13 year old daughter. She loves them! They were shipped and received very quickly, less than two weeks. I was a little bummed that the color of the stones were a lighter blue than the photo. They are still gorgeous, but not the London blue color as shown. Very nice earrings, especially for the price."
2,Predictable cliche,"There's not much to this novel. From the get go, I knew that the two main characters would get together. I don't think the monk's motives for first joining the priesthood and later leaving it were fully explored. His letters to his fellow priest at the monestary were irritating and full of trivial musings. Overall, I found the book dull and predictable. There was no plot to speak of, and the characters felt flat and drawn, instead of complex and developed."
3,A bit slow,"One good thing to say about this book is that if it were any longer, it would be a real snooze. The length sustains the plotline ably, but I was distracted by what I thought was plot and dialogue that was littered with distracting cliche. The character of the monk (Mike) is rich, but Rebecca tends to be little more than the stereotypical single mom. It was strange to juxtapose the much more complex character of Mike with Rebecca, and that's where the story lost me."
5,A thinking romance,"Thinking and romance novels often don't work well together because of the very nature of romance novels. Mr. Farrington pulls off an incredible read, that is both light hearted and deep and profound all at the same time and very romantic. Loved it totally."
4,Not just a fun romance,"I really liked this book not only as a fun romance, but if you were willing to dig and search some, it was a fascinating examination of religion and, in the monk's case, finding how his religion could fit in the context of a ""normal"" life. He has lived as an ""all or none."" Either I'm a monk, or I don't know if God exists because the monastery wasn't quite doing it for me. I loved the end and the benefits of having religion - even if you don't necessarily believe, the ability to hand some of your problems over to a higher being has a powerful effect on the psyche."
5,Extremely Well Written,"Rebecca Martin is divorced with a 6 year old daughter. She rents out her ""in-law"" apartment to Michael Christopher - a man who just left a monastery after 20 years.He's struggling to find a new way and she's struggling with her job, her irresponsible ex-husband and being a single parent. They slowly become friends and then more than friends.It's not an easy path but a wonderful read of family, friendship and love."
2,Disappointing,"While the characters were likable enough (albeit one-dimensional and sorely underdeveloped), the plot was so disappointingly unconventional that I am actually shocked this book received such high reviews. This was my first Tim Farrington novel, and I was so unimpressed with The Monk Downstairs that will not pick up another one of his books. Writing quality was unexceptional, situations seemed awkward and less than believable. Tim does a disservice to Catholicism and monastic life (failing miserably to examine what all is involved in switching vocations, having sex with a woman he barely knows and isn't married to.. it overall just leaves a bad taste). There is a proposal in the story, which was the only point I laughed- and because of the ridiculousness, not because of any intended humor on the author's part. Overall, Tim Farrington failed to separate himself from the rest- any writer who cranks out cheap dime-a-dozen romance novels could have written this predictable sub-par story."
2,Ordinary,"I was surprised to see such high ratings for this book. i personally found it to be nothing too out of the ordinary. The book was not very insightful and the few shimerring pieces of writing seemed to peek from the letters that the monk wrote back ot the monastery. The biggest let down was that the 'monk' did not really have anything to add to the storyline. Had it been an average Joe living downstaairs, the story would have still remained the same. The story was not about a relationship with a monk but with a man who happened to be a monk. 2 similar but very distint lines of thought."
4,Charming,"As soon as I read the beginning of this book, when the ex-monk , Michael Christopher, moved into an apartment in the home of Rebecca, a single mother, I figured that it would be a predictable ""boy meets girl"" kind of book.Well, it was a ""boy meets girl"" book but it was anything but predictable. The quirky baggage-laiden characters and difficult situations reminded me of Anne Tyler's writing, which I love. The book was not overly detailed nor overwritten; the dialogue was realistic; and the characters were very appealing. The warm and honestly rendered story was full of hope and everyday spirituality, written in such lovely language.Michael and Rebecca, as well as her daughter Mary Martha, are delightful, real, and engaging characters - and so are the ""minor"" characters. Farrington's portrayal of their day-to-day life struggles will endear these folks to all who read the book."
4,Spiritual allegory/sweet romance,"I was fully expecting this book to be a cute little romance and was delightfully surprised soon after beginning it that there are many layers to this novel. Farrington deftly weaves the story of spiritual journey into a simple, yet lovely romance so well that one disinterested in spiritual things would enjoy the tale for its love story, while someone who wants to seek a deeper meaning can find a lot to think about. The beauty of this book is that there is not a lot of the usual relational missteps thrown in simply to complicate the plot. But there is just enough legitimate angst to make it feel real.Although unabashed in his symbolism, particularly in the naming of the characters, Farrington does a great job of posing spiritual questions in an unobtrusive way. I felt as though I could sit and peel away layer after layer and still come up with something new to consider, which makes this a wonderful book for a discussion group."
4,Very enjoyable little love story,"This was such a joy to read. It is about a single mom who is struggling and loosing faith in men, and a monk who has left the fold and renting an apartment from her.These two unlikely people form a friendship that is so touching and hopeful. It restores faith in love. It is also a very witty book. Terrific writing. I would read another by this author.Loved it!"
5,Very Charming,"The Monk Downstairs is an extremely charming novel, a love story that stays clear of sappiness and cliche. Rebecca Martin is a single mother who rents out an apartment in her San Francisco home to Michael Christopher, a man who has just left the monastery after 20 years. Rebecca has an irresponsible ex-husband, a wonderful daughter, an independent and nosy mother and is pursued Bob, a man who desperately wants to marry her. Rebecca is an extremely likeable protagonist, sympathetic and believable. Her relationship with Michael is believable and her story is a pleasure to read. It's compelling and will keep you up at night until you finish. Enjoy."
4,Pretty good,The 368B does the job for me. It is very sturdy. My only complaint is that the legs are a little troublesome to collapse or expand.
4,Wish this was still in print,This is a great book for nurses who might want to publish. I am teaching a class in which students need to know this information. It is just sad that this book is out of print and there is no plan for a new edition. Why do publishers do this?
3,"Where is ""Scatterlings of Africa?""","This is a decent, but far from complete collection of Juluka's recordings. Particularly troubling is the absence of the song ""Scatterlings of Africa"" which is a must to be included on any 'best of' collection. That it is missing from here is a serious oversight and distracts from the rest of the songs. The result is a less than completely compelling picture of Juluka."
3,I love Johnny Clegg's Music,"I love some of the Juluka songs, especially Scatterlings. On this album I particularly like the track called Africa. Listening to any of Johnny's songs takes me home, no matter where in the world I may be. I feel that the early works with Juluka might do well in a country like South Africa, where Zulu is understood. Johnny Clegg attained international recognition with his band Savuka, due to the fusion of not only the lyrics, but the music as well. The quality and mastering of Savuka's recording, engineering and musical ability on Shadow Man and Cruel, Crazy, Beautiful World is far more superior than many Jaluka songs I've heard. Johnny Clegg will always hold a special place in my heart and in my life, and even though I prefer his works with Savuka, I love listening to all of it."
2,Buyer beware,"This is a reproduction, which means it looks like somthing I could have printed myself. 12x17 is the about the size of a regular sheet of computer paper and it has white borders that are not very profesional looking."
2,loom for something better,"bought this bag to use as a backpack carrier and I had to reinforce both of the outside seems because they ripped completely, and this is after about 4 months of use. I guess it could stand up if you were putting light loads in, but I wasn't carrying lots of heavy textbooks or something like that"
2,Eldorado C.D,"Rec in 4 days, Great. Good packing yet it was cracked, song ""Heavy Love""stoped at 4min. 41sec. skipped to 4min. 43 sec. and played to finished. Not to happy with it, hope this does`nt happen with other orders. Sound is good, love to hear Neil play on Old Black, song ""Eldorado"" is cool love it when He add`s alittle spanish to rock awsome. Sound`s and voice are like his early c.d. Still love it. Joan Cruz"
3,Steering Wheel Cover,I like this product alot. It does have a new smell that gets in your hands. i don't mind it but my husband didn't like it. It was difficult to get on the steering wheel. My husband had to do it for me and I am pretty strong.
4,Army Cross,"I bought this for my son who is in the Army. The cross is nice quality. The chain is fairly light and broke the first day he wore it. This was really not an issue for him because he put it on his dog tag chain. This is a really nice piece for anyone currently serving in the Army or retired from the Army, but you may need to consider a different chain."
1,Pure PsychoBabble,"If you go in for hipster pop-psyche of the trendy and trite, then by all means you'll love this exercise in stereotypes. Or if you wish your five year old could only get in more prime-time TV, you may also like it. If not, however, feel free to skip this pseudo-intellectual claptrap."
4,NOT TOO HIPPY,"people may say this book is too ""hippy"" but i think it is a fun and enjoyable book about basicly not judging a book by it's cover. Yes i confess that i chose this book because of it's cover but i am glad i did. it jumps right in to the plot of the story and never drags on.Cloe's stepfather sends her to FL to visit his sister. Cloe thinks that this will be boring. Cloe has always had to compete with the in and outs of styles if it is fashion or boys you have to know when to like it or hate it. She soon finds out that in some cases you need to not care if your hair is frizzy or if you are sweating like a pig but as long as you are enjoying being with the people you are with. READ THIS BOOK PLEASE!!!!"
5,Absolutely Terrific!,"This was the first Celtic CD we bought and it was so great, we've been buying them ever since. This is still one of our top favorites and I strongly recommend it to everyone."
5,Great Music,"I was given this CD several years ago but lost it in a move. I missed it a lot. When I found it on Amazon, I was so happy I bought a copy right away. The songs are very uplifting and the vocals are smooth and strong. I recommend this CD to one who likes/loves Celtic Music."
4,Four and a half actually...,"This is an album worth buying. I love all the songs, though I don't understand a word of those that aren't in English. When I first discovered Celtic music, this was my first inquisition, and it still is one of my favorites. I tend to agree with a reviewer that I don't really understand the order of the compilation, but I also agree with this reviewer that Celtic music is a broad field. I cannot imagine trying to choose just twelve to put into one CD..."
3,Some good songs,"If you are into world music, these putamayo cd's are great. You can't go wrong. If you are into top 40 pop music, these are not for you."
5,Just what The doctor ordered,This item works well for keeping the mic away from the stand allowing room for guitars. I tried a flexible goose neck but it was way too loose and would not hold the mic steady. The locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in 1 position. The short extension in the picture is not on the unit I received but it really is not needed it works fine as delivered. I would purchase this unit again and again. It is a good piece and a good deal!
2,to short/....,Not really useful coz its too short....Not really useful coz its too short....Not really useful coz its too short....
5,What's Done In The Dark,"Gloria Mallette has done it again. this book was so good I could'nt put the book down. it has soooo many twist and turns that you can't wait to get to the next page. this certainly a modern day version of Cain and Able, only it's the female version. this is a must read."
1,I would like a refund,"I am so sorry I spent my dollars on this book. The entire book is about two sisters' anger - no plot, no nothing - nada. I have read her books before and was not overly impressed but am always willing to give an author a chance. Sorry that I did."
2,Disappointed,Found this book to be disappointing. Expected it to be more of a murder mystery which it wasn't. Overall found the book to be depressing.
2,Way too much drama!,"I didn't like this book at all. There was so much going on that it was hard to keep track of it all. The dialogue between the characters at times was just unbelievable and took so many different tangents I didn't know what I was supposed to be reading. The language used was very, very, strong and explicit and it was way too much for me. I read all of the reviews and I was so excited about reading it, but I think everyone needs to find their own preferences and stick to them."
1,Not what it appeared to be!,I was greatly disappointed in what I actually received. It was not a commentary of any kind in itself. It was a total misrepresentation.
3,Not what you'd think,"This is not at all a bad book, for what it is. But what it is is not really ""Trout Streams of Alberta"" but more like ""A Beginner's Guide to Fly-Fishing (especially in Alberta)"".Only about 100 pp. are on the rivers of Alberta (not much on ""streams""). The rest is a general intro to fishing, spinning and fly-fishing. Nice plates of the author's favorite flies. Some interesting stories."
3,"Good book, shame about the artwork!","As far as board books go, this is a very good one, however it says it's drawn by some of the best Japanese artists. I've seen Japanese art way better than what's in this book. Since I draw Mewtwo a lot, I noticed a lot of faults in the pictures of him. Some were even quite scary looking. I'd buy this book only if you are a true collector."
2,after 2 times it's not working,yes this sterilizer heat up very fast and work great but I used it only 2 times and it's stop working. The power is not on and doesn't create steam. I can't return it because I bought it 2 months before my son was born.
5,perfect!,"Absolutely perfect product for those first weeks after arrival of your baby. No need for pots,boiling water on the stove top...etc. Just toss your items, pour desired amount of water and push the button. Return to it later when you have time! Highly reccomended."
5,Works perfectly with Born Free bottles as well,"The sterilizer fits 6 BPA free Born Free bottles and their associated accoutrements (nipples, rings, caps, valves). It works flawlessly thusfar!"
5,awesome product. worth every penny!,"I had registered for the Avent, but it was too expensive at Babies R Us so my sister bought me a sterilizer made by FirstYears? or something for around $40 and it broke down within TWO WEEKS! Turns out it this was only a bit more to order on Amazon w/ free shipping anyway.Don't be cheap - get THIS sterilizer, it's wonderfully efficient. AND you get two free bottles! Gotta love the free stuff :)"
2,Erronious Description or False Advertising?,"Product arrived, much to my surprise - there were NO BOTTLES!!!The compact size fits the space well, it works well, but the incorrect description disappoints me.I need to investigate pricing to see if I was short changed."
1,WARNING! Avent Bottles Contain BPA Bisphenol-A,"I liked Avent Bottles, my daughter Liked them too! Then I found out about Bisphenol -A being used to make the Bottles. After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. Do your own research. I'm really surprised the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated."
4,"Challenging, inspiring","This volume should be a must for anyone interested in following the Shaolin path, I found it to be clear and it continually challenged me to increase my efforts to learn the techniques of the Shaolin masters. Well worth the money."
4,Good,"This book covers the Lohan set in Shaolin. It, like a couple other books by Draeger, is direct and specialized. There is a bit of information about Shaolin as a whole, but the main gist is the form. It also only has only one application for each movement. Anyways, it is a good book, for those wanting to know this form and some of its applications."
3,Not Chinese Shaolin Lohan at all,"This material covered in this book, for those that want the information is Not Chinese Shaolin Lohan form.It is a Malaysian derivative from Shaolin.If you think you can learn how to do this form from a book, especially this one, you are clearly delusional.Get a real KF teacher."
3,pretty but not comfortable...,same experience as the previous reviewer...bought it half a year ago and liked the style a lot.however my skin got bruised. now i don't wear it any more...
3,"this shoes looks good, but not comfortable.","It hurts my feet. Especially the upper front size is covered by some robber material which is kind of firm. One time I wore it to dance in a club.Later, inside skin of my toenails were bruised. Some days later those came off."
5,Comfy shoes,"I just ordered this shoes and absolutely love it. It fits well, very comfy and looks nice too. This is definitely a great buy -- and at a reasonable price."
4,how to be happy...toss true-false replace with kinda-sorta,"I read this about 7 years ago and it totally changed my life and my view of the world. (NOTE: It changed for the better)It's kind of a disorganized mess of a book but you'll get used to it. Read at least the first few chapters.Basically taught me to let go and think of everything in a ""fuzzy"" way. I think the people of the world would be much happier if they were able to toss the idea of black-white/true-false answers."
1,A reader,"I bought this book when i was first being introduced to the fuzzy logic world, and i must say i get very disapointed of this.Fist off, the author spend most time criticizing everything with occidental flavor, from religion to philosophy and i should say that i found this very upseting and distracting.About the explanations on the subject of fuzzy logic, the author uses some very abstract examples, they are good but not so ilustrative for someone who is just begining in this world and hopes to find clear examples. I give one or two stars for this item."
2,Disappointing,"I'm not sure if it's my fault or the book's fault, i just couldn't seem to grasp what's it's all about. It keeps repeating the same thing by giving us numerous way to illustrate the idea of black and white versus gray. It's bought last year and i still haven't finished yet (if I'm to finish it), during that period i've already read like 50 of other bestsellers and they didn't disappoint me except this seemingly popular book. I'm still open to the possibility of my own fault, email me if you want to enlighten me."
4,An important book that failed,"Denotation and connotation ... fuzzy logic is losing the battle of Semantics to the ordinary.Fozzy is a cute bear in a children's puppet show.and fuzzy logic is ""bad thinking"" in the popular mind and usage.""Gradu-Weighted Logic"" would be more effective usage than fuzzy logicno matter what it has come to mean to philosophers, mathematicians engineers and even musicians.In the long run the philosophical aspect is probablythe most important while fuzzy engineering has turned into a Japanese fad.We needed this book ( which is well written and informative) , but we needed morethe ideas behind ""fuzzy thinking"" tobe taken seriously.Fuzzy Engineering"
1,A kid's newfound excitement,"Mr. Bart's excitement in finding something which had been known to the world for thousands of years is amusing. But he saw it for himself fought to let other people know that he knows it, but that doesnot make him a seer of truth nor the Columbus of new ideas. The worst thing I found in this book is he tried to prove something right at the cost of proving something wrong. In the process he showed his immaturity of thoughts and he cannibalized what he tried to show the world, the peaceful coexistence of ideas in a middle-path. He fought a crusade of the east vs. the west, ""logical"" science vs. fuzzy science completely ruling out the emergence of a synergical consciousness. I disliked the book and donot think I would jump to read his other publications. He has a lot more to learn to sound convincing and needs to change his attitude towards knowledge."
1,Absurd,"This isn't a book, it's an ego trip. I slogged through about half of it before finally realizing that he probably wasn't going to say anything comprehensible at any point. Save your money!"
2,Incoherent,"This book is written in a ""stream of consciousness"" style and that makes things incoherent. The book was disappointing. There was only about 2 chapters talking about the technology behind fuzzy logic. This book doesn't explain much."
3,good for students of all types of philosophy,"A book worth the read for students of the philosophies of the inner and outer worlds. A spirited appeal for toleration and wisdom, a plea against the closed mind in all of us, and a clarion call to those who think they have any answers. A word about the book's dedication, though. Would that everyone had the opportunity to do three degrees! Make the most of whatever you have."
3,Bawdy and cheap,"If you like bawdy songs and filthy limericks you'll enjoy this book. It's delightfully dirty. I liked it a lot and found some great material for singing around the campfire when there are no children around. But... it's not perfect. My biggest complaint is that there is very little indication of the music for the songs. A few songs list the name of a better known song with the same tune. But most are just lyrics.The pagination is off by 3 pages. Not a major flaw, but it's a bit annoying."
1,Typical garbage,"I truly dislike being lied to, and the author lies in this book, saying that diversity awareness isn't common sense. It is in large part common sense. It also requires maturity to apply the common sense. It does not require a degree or formal training. It does not require college classes, or textbooks. Information can help, but dealing with other cultures, however they are delineated, requires more than knowledge. Specifics on how to avoid offending particular cultures (in the broad spectrum, since it often comes down to individuals, not collectives) can be helpful, but providing such help is beyond the scope of any single, short and overpriced book. A better book to buy would be ""Making Friends With Black People,"" which is informed by common sense and humor, something profoundly lacking in this book."
5,A MUST have for all who seek health,"I recommend this book to ALL Health Care Professionals, as well as health enthusiasts. The sick and the well can both prosper from the content of this publication. Come Alive is well written, it is full of interesting information, and it is written in a way that everyone can understand. Water, salt, antioxidants, minerals, enzymes and electrolytes, are a few of the topics that are detailed in the book. The effects, the benefits and the hazards of our dietary choices are all eloquently explained. The philosophy of the book is that healing begins from within. Come Alive takes the reader through a step by step analysis that explains the disease fighting elements that we can experience through diet.Best Regards to all,"
4,LandRover diecast model,This was a Christmas gift for my husband - he loved it (even though he would have preferred the real thing). The car was bigger than I thought and the design was very detail. The product came on a stand so it's not the type of car that kids can play with. Great product
5,extreme cold,"I have been a faithful user of TriDerma products for the last two years - particularly the Intense Recovery Cream and Facial Redness product. I have mild to moderate rosacea and have found that these products keep the rosacea at bay and keep my skin presentable. I recently made the decision to move from the warm, damp coastal part of Canada to the Prairies - land of snow and extreme cold and dryness. I thought I should purchase the Extreme Moisturizer in hopes that it would keep my dry, sensitive skin from suffering. The product is marvelous - deliciously creamy and non-greasy - and safe enough to put on my eyelids as well. My skin has not suffered at all with the change of climate thanks to this serious moisturizer. As a bonus, the price is reasonable and certainly better than the cosmetic offerings that offer high prices but little relief."
4,An excellent writer tackles a problem many of us share,"Perhaps I am a bit jaded; my father-in-law is in the late stages of dementia, and over the years I have read many books written by relatives who watch over a loved one's decline into this disease.What Sue Miller adds to this ""genre"" is the general excellence of her writing. (Miller is well-known as the author of novels such as ""The Good Mother."") Thus, ""The Story of My Father"" rises above the sad story of her father's decline (a story whose outlines will be familiar to many of us) and gives us more, a touching portrait of the man her father was throughout his life.I did not learn anything new about Alzheimer's from reading this book. But I think most of us read books like this not for the medical facts, but for the sense that we are not alone, that other people have been there, too. If that describes you well, you will find ""The Story of My Father"" a very sympathetic choice."
4,I am Not the only one...,"It was nice to read of Sue's experience, as I am now going down a simalar path with my mother. There were many things she said that are happening in my case and it was indeed good to know I was not alone. I have similar thoughts and feelings and to see the similarities to my mom's case was enlightening. The book will make the next steps easier as I know much more what to expect from the disease and what I can do and to asuage my guilt feelings. Thanks for writing this."
3,Not a complete waste of time...,"Maybe it's because I don't have a parent currently struggling with Alzheimer's or maybe because I was listening to the book and not actually reading it, but when the second CD ended, I just couldn't bring myself to put the third one in. I felt almost as if I was caught in the hallway with a coworker who kept droning on and on, oblivious to the fact that I wasn't really listening anymore and had somewhere else I needed to be...20 minutes ago. I listen to books on my commute to fill my time and take my mind off of traffic, but I found myself sighing and not following the story, because quite honestly, in my opinion there isn't much of one. Granted, I didn't give the book a real chance, but after the first two hours, I felt no indication that it was going to get any better. It was almost out of politeness that I brought myself to flip to the third disk, but then I realized no one would ever know that I didn't finish this book unless I told them. So I didn't."
2,Electronic Horn,PROS: Installed easily. Just drill the right sized holes and insert. Two color coded wires on back that you can crimp or solder.CONS: Sounds horrible. Nothing like a regular horn at all. Sounds like one of those commercial fire alarms that you find in a hotel. About as close to finger nails on a chalk board as you can get. I immediately ordered a traditional replacement horn.
2,Wouldn't hold a charge,"Similar to other review, the batteries self drain very quickly. I fully charged 6 and put into a portable label maker. After printing two labels the unit sat for 3 days and was dead when I went to use it again. I recharged the same six and reinstalled. Worked day one, worked day 2, was dead day 3 (about 4 labels). This same label maker would print 50-60 labels with regular alkaline batteries so I know it's not the unit. I've got some Enelope's charging now, we'll see how they do."
4,"Decent enough, for the price","For this price, this CD is worth it (if it were regular priced, I would give it 3 stars). Tone is decent, intonation and technique are acceptable. There's nothing wrong with the playing, it's just not terribly notable. Sometimes Ricci doesn't seem quite convinced that these concertos are worth playing- which doesn't help convincing the listener. The Goldmark's a nice piece, the Saint-Saens #3 is much more interesting than the overly extended #2. Chang and Bell's Goldmark recordings are preferable- I don't know about the Saint-Saens.Final verdict: If you're looking for an ok, cheap recording of these lesser-known pieces, this is it. But if you're looking for inspiration, try elsewhere."
1,Not Recommended,"We bought three of these to replace our older LCD projectors. These projectors do not work with our Dell laptops (Latitude D630, Inspiron 6400)in clone mode using the analog input - the ""normal"" way we use all our projectors. Sometimes the projector display will work for a minute, but usually not - it just stays on or reverts to a blank blue screen and says ""searching"". Not recommended."
4,Good cook book for beginners,This book is a good cookbook for beginners. The ingredient lists are simple. Most of them can be found at your local grocery stores. I've tried some recipes. The taste is closed enough to mama's home cooking.
5,Better every time,"I don't know how these guys do it, but every time I hear them or see them, they've taken their unique approach to music to a new level of excellence. This album is no exception: it has all of the brilliant improv and exceptional composition as their previous releases, and the introduction of Hoenig's subtle and mind-altering drums really makes this one take off."
1,ES HORRIBLE,"ME ENCANTO EL CD ""ENTREGA TOTAL"", PERO ESTE ES HORRIBLE, POR FAVOR NO LO COMPREN PORQUE HAY MEJOR MUSICA..."
2,Disappointed,"I received the t-shirt promptly but the shirt must have been sitting for years. It was extremely discolored and dirty. I did not send the shirt back because the shirt might not have been replaced in time, so I soaked it in tide and baking soda and it is as good as new."
1,Not happy,"I bought the wrong book form this seller. When i e-mailed them they never responded. That was over a month ago. I was interested in knowing the selleres return policy. A MONTH went by without any return e-mail or contact. I was not at all happy and content with this seller, for their lack of attentiveness...."
5,An Album for Peaceful Thoughts & Quiet Introspection,"The album Rachel's Song is subtitled ""The Instrumental Album"" which does not truly reflect the tranquil qualities of the CD. The selections on this CD bearing such titles as ""Symphony of Peace,"" ""Images of Hope,"" ""Tranquil Moments,"" etc., indicate the album's focus and emphasis. Just as with Prim's other CD, ""Beautiful Thoughts,"" the music is perfect for reading, writing, or introspection or as background music for just about anything you wish to do."
2,rachels song,"when i put the cd in my car player it stuck in there after the first songwhen trying to retrieve it ,it got scratches on it."
3,Second dress needed,"My daughter LOVES Ariel so of course we bought this doll. When we got home we realized when Ariel becomes human and needs legs, she has nothing to wear. When you take off her fin she is naked. Definately needs a second skirt or the existing skirt needs to come apart. Something needs to change!"
4,Great guide with cool tricks and haacks,"I really liked this book. Ita has lots of cool trick and hacks that I hadn't really heard of. Writing was good, but the best part was learning some cool new ways to use my favorite toy. If you want to get them most out of your ipod this is the best book out there."
2,really dull,"Lady Elizabeth goes to Egypt to visit her father, an archaelogist. Lord Jonathan has not been home to England in quite a few years and is currently living in Egypt working for the king. The king sends Jonathan on a mission to learn what Elizabeth's father is searching for and Jonathan decides that he will seduce her if necessary and then marry her to find out her father's secret.The entire novel is just boring. There is nothing new here except the setting. Jonathan does not even do that good of a job at seducing her and she is naive enough as to be quite dumb. Granted, this was written in the early 90's which, in my opinion, is very much a hit or miss period for romance novels. They seem to be very good and among my favorites, or just painful to get through.All the charcters were flat as was their dialogue and their interactions with each other. I couldn't care less whether Elizabeth and Jonathan got together. Overall, I would not recomend this book."
3,Tepid suspense at best in this simple morality tale,"The story does begin in an engaging fashion with a distorted timeline and brillant cinematography. However, the overall malaise and idle philosophising of the story soon drag it down. Yes, it is a condemnation of fascism (how novel), but there is little riveting in the story, and the interal operations of the secret police are clownish as well. Not overly convincing or emotionally involving as the characters are shallow and little developed. Pass."
3,Horrible YELLOW subtitles,"This is one of the great European films, and it's just great that it has been given an almost proper release, BUT, there are HUGE bright YELLOW subtitles almost right in the MIDDLE of the screen. Why? This makes the film almost unwatchable. They are so OBTRUSIVE it is almost better watching the dubbed version. Don't buy this. Wait and see if there is a less horrible version released in Europe."
2,Overrated,"Having now seen The Conformist again, in ""restored"" form, I've got to say I think it terribly overrated. Just for a start, one thing I find problematic is the equation of repressed or latent homosexuality, if that's what it is, with fascist tendencies, or guilt about some homosexual exeperience (as indicated at the end of the film) with whatever the central character's pathology. But then this is not sufficiently clearly sketched to make any real sense; it's the kind of thing that can only be taken seriously in the context of a particular kind of left-wing European machismo of the 1960s. Otherwise it's nonsense. Perhaps one's not meant to take it as ""realism"" but as ""symbolism"" all the way through the film, but even then it fails to join the dots; certainly, it doesn't work as ""realism"". Despite some effective scenes (like the final murder), I think that as a whole this movie has a vastly inflated reputation."
2,WIERD TECHNICOLOR,"Why the release of this outstanding film to DVD has been so long delayed has been mysterious. Previously the only version available in the USA was an overdubbed VHS. Not that Bertolucci used actors who were all speaking Italian in the scenes, the sound was added post, but it is great that this version has the option of Italian and French. However, this movie is really meant to be seen in original Black and White and this copy is TECHNICOLOR. Wierd. I was wondering why so cheep. Kind of dissappointing for one of my favorite movies of all time."
2,Top 10 it's not.,"Not as spectacular as other reviews led me to believe. I hadn't seen it before, but with comments like ""precursor to The Godfather"" and ""one of the 10 best movies"" I thought I'd give it a try. It's an OK movie at best. It has some interesting visuals and unique cinematography, but the story is just not interesting or engaging. I'm generally very easy to please when it comes to movies, but for the last half hour of this movie I was just waiting for it to end. The cheesy 70s dialog and hammy acting didn't help either. Sorry, but I really can't recommend it."
4,Psychedelic Crime tale pays off,"This is certainly not a fluff piece that can be easily digested. Kind of like how if you tune in to the Sopranos or Lost in the middle of it all - well - you'll get the gist but not the depth.Tom's book demands that you pay attention. And that's a good, and rare, selling point in this day and age of novels as thinly disguised screenplays.Stories are made on the strnegth of their characters. Now, I may be biased because I grew up on the east coast with lots of similar people, but in the end, I feel this book is a really worthy read.The great thing about it is this: say there were no ghosts in the book, well, it'd be just as great. On the flipside, if it were all about ghosts, the same applies. The fact that both worlds are melded so well is testament to a very unique writer with a very unique take on the world."
3,Food for though,"Crawford builds on themes from his earlier work, reiterating that libraries cannot be only digital and that the human element will always be a necessary part of the library. He sees technology as providing tools to help librarians find answers rather than being the answer in itself. This book does not present new information. However, it does offer a comprehensive look at issues which are important to today's libraries and those of the future. Practicing librarians should read it, as it will certainly make them think about what they will need to do in order to help their library remain viable in the new century."
4,Handiest little tool,"I use one of these almost daily at work. It's quite compact and very versatile. I knocked a star off because I agree with the others that it should have been packaged with a #1 Phillips/small slotted instead of the square driver. Nevertheless, it is a keeper. J&H"
4,Handy Dandy,"I Love it, but if you loose one bit or wear it out, you must buy a whole new unit. I fount that it has easy 1/4 and 5/16 sockets (with bits removed) for hex head screws and most hose clamps etc. Functionality is 5 star, but as mt Phillips head gets a little worn, I begin to wonder about those replacement parts."
1,2010 Jetta poor fit and manageablity,"I'm not clear where the ball was dropped here, but the shade neither fits my 2010 Jetta (as indicated in the description,) and it is also quite difficult to roll back up.The size is too large for the dash/windshield area.I really can't say much else other than look for alternatives if you have a need for this specific product type and specific model car."
4,fits perfect,"This sunshade doesn't let any light in! The only negative is it takes up a lot of room, but it is made of a sturdy material and isn't flimsy at all. Fits my 2006 Jetta perfect!"
3,"Good, but...","The product came very quick, and had excellent packaging. However, for a ""custom"" sunshade of this price, I really expected a better fit on my 2006 Jetta 5th generation."
4,how many is refugees in country,how many is counrty is refugees in each one i think it 43 in one countr
3,SLOW SHIPPING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I HAVE RATED IT 3 STARS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN IT YET! I PRESUME THIS IS A VERY FINE WATCH AND ALL, BUT THE SHIPPING... HOW CAN I PUT THIS? SUCKS!!!!!!!! I DID NOT GET MY PRODUCT AFTER 2 WEEKS OF WAITING AND NOW THEY PUT FREE 2 DAY SHIPPING FOR THIS PRODUCT. WELL THATS JUST SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU ARE A NON-PATIENT CUSTUMER AND YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK(WHERE A LOT OF IMPATIENT CUSTUMERS PRESIDE) THEN DO NOT(UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES) BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent Watch,"I was looking for a rugged watch to go everywhere I go and keep me on time. My Timex Ironman can go anywhere my body can go and keeps great time. It is -10 seconds per month which is better than the Casios. It is shock and water resistant just like the Casios. Unlike the Casio, it doesn't beep every time I push a button which could be bad in a tactical situation. It helps me meet my run times by keeping track of my lap times. It helps me train for my timed push-ups and sit-ups by beeping at set intervals. If you're looking for high performance without a high price this is your watch."
1,Doesnt seem like this DVD ever actually came out.,"I preordered this DVD when it was first announced. It never arrived. The listed release date changed about 10 times over the last year. Now its out-of-print. Cant even locate any real proof it exists anywhere (cover scans, advertisement from manufacturer, etc). Mabey a few people recieved it, but I dunno...Ive also had 'Max Fleischer Color Cartoons' DVD from the same manufacturer on order for months and months...same story... release date just changes constantly, but it never comes out.Go figure."
3,Good but different,"This CD is reminiscent of 'Notes from the Underground,' with an all acoustic setup. It is mostly ambient/free jazz with sparse latin or polyrhythmic grooves throughout. I like it, but it's a little over my head. If you're looking for a starter CD for MMW I would suggest 'Friday Afternoon in the Universe' which is my personal favorite."
4,Like Days of Old,"This live CD is a wonderful return to MMW`s roots. After furthering their reputation as Electro-Funk meisters on their last 4 CD`s, the trio return to the sound of It`s A Jungle Out There, and raise the bar at the same time. Along with the change of gears, they record the CD live at Tonic`s, a club in NYC. This recording features amazing sound, a great song list, and a groove that at times harkens back to days of great jazz trio`s on Blue Note.From the strains of free form, to the off beat measures, to even a cover of Hey Joe, this is an absolute treat. While the trio returns to their unique meat and potatoes sound, let`s hope they slip in a few desserts with every now and then."
5,Acoustic again (finally),"This album is a masterpiece. For those of you who thought that electricity and minimalism were getting in the way John Medeski's brilliant musical ability, this Tonic will cure all that ails you. From the swingin' beats of Afrique and Rise Up, to the soothing, mellow tones of Hey Joe, this album proves that MMW has matured into true Jazz Musicians. This album is Notes From the Underground--kicked up more than a few knotches."
5,Acoustically awesome,"I had never heard anything acoustic from MMW until I picked up this album. I loved every minute of this concert. ""Afrique"" and ""Rise Up"" were by far the best tracks on the CD. The great thing about this CD is that is a different MMW experience, but you can still it's them."
1,Buyer Beware - Defective CD,I have ordered this CD two times from Amazon and both times the CD was defective. The second disc was completely blank!
4,~ Great value ~,"I have only had this bridle a couple days, but it is very nice, and at a super reasonable price compared to the other figure 8 bridles at over $200, two hundred dollars!! You do need to make sure you oil it before you use it or even fit it because of fear of the leather cracking. Overall a very nice bridle with a very soft piece on the noseband. Great value, and shipped fast!"
5,A _fantastic_ sampler....,"...now let's bug the powers that be to make the albums for these individuals more readily available! Kidjo, Toure and Johnny Clegg are easy to find, but most of the rest of these folks need more airplay (or websites that recognize their talent). C'mon Amazon, show us what you can do!"
4,There is a great 2nd edition!,"Search for: ""Transforming Leadership: Equipping Yourself and Coaching Others to Build the Leadership Organization."""
4,Shelter,"Sometimes music wraps you up and cradles you like a baby in a blanket. That may be cheezy or cliche but that's how many of the songs of this album have made me feel. It made me appreciate folk in a way I hadn't before and would recommend it to anyone. Although a few tracks are not my particular favorites, it's worth it for every other song."
1,Not the Best by a Long Shot,"This collection is a major disappointment. The songs are uniformly bland and certainly not the best of these artists. Most feature a tuneless lyric sung to a gently strummed guitar with soporific keyboard decoration. For example, Nanci Griffith is represented by ""Spin on a Red Brick Floor"" and Sarah Mclachlan is represented by ""Shelter."" Never heard of these tunes? You're not alone. The one standout is ""Orbiting Jupiter"" by Cheryl Wheeler, but there's nothing else approaching it in quality. My guess is a bunch of crappy songs were chosen for licensing reasons. If you're interested in listening to a good collection of contemporary singer-songwriters, keep searching."
1,"Best artist, maybe. Best songs, I'm not so sure.","I bought this album and set out to actually listen to it all the way through. It was mildly interesting but, a couple of months later, I have lost interest. The only tunes I can remember are ""Shelter"" by Sarah McLachlan and ""Spin On A Red Brick Floor"" by Nanci Griffith. Considering the cost of this CD set, I don't think it's a good investment."
1,I agree with Carlos,"There are only a select few songs I enjoy. I thought may be he (Carlos) was just an extraneous factor...after buying the album, however, I definitely agree that it's not worth the investment. Putumayo is an excellent label, and has other selections that are awesome: Mediterranean Odyssey, Africa, and Romantica are among my favorites."
5,Love Love Love It,"This is a fantastic bowl. Sturdy and Beautiful! As you probably guessed, I love it. Yes, it is a bit heavy but it's a big bowl (12x12x7). However, it is not as heavy as I expected it to be. Great craftsmanship. I also have the small bowl (7.8x7.8x5.5) and I love it as well. I'm now waiting on the medium bowl (9.5x9.5x6) to come back in stock and my set will be complete."
3,Interesting....,I oreded this without realizing that it was one that I had already seen. There are others that are better than this one......but for the price....you can't beat it.
3,Ghost stories,It is not bad but at the same time Id never need to watch it again. it just wasnt exciting enough.
2,Not impressed,Breakfast had umpteen recipes for muffins but not much more! The rest was also not very helpful.
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping for some innovative recipies and some neat things I could cook with my toddler. While this book offers a little of each, there isn't enough of either. Many of the recipies contain fatty ingredients. Also, while it isn't a ""recipie,"" on a page of other meal ideas they suggest pouring chili over corn chips; hardly a healthy meal for my toddler -- even if they do suggest you serve it with fruit."
2,Disappointing.,"I bought this book because I wanted recipes similar to the best-odds recipes in the back of ""What To Expect The First Year."" What I found was recipes for food that, quite frankly, I could easily make without a written recipe. There's a couple of good ones in there, but it's not worth the investment."
5,What a terrific resource for parents!,"Food for Tots is a charming, information-packed resource that will help parents of toddlers find a wide variety of appealing and healthy foods. I especially enjoyed the ""tot tips"" that answered questions a parent might have as she reads the recipes and commentary. This useful book also includes important nutrition information, advice about common feeding problems and information about food allergies."
3,Nothing special...,I'd have to rate these Exuviance products as average. They did not improve my skin but did not make it any worse. I am a women of color and have commbination normal/dry skin and. It has been a struggle to fine products that deliver moisture but do not clog pores and cause breakouts. I was hoping this was it but the search continues.
5,WOW!,"Great value, this is my second purchase of this model Wahl. The first lasted about 9 years. I dropped and broke a couple of the teeth on the blade. Cheaper to replace than fix. Like the energy bunny it just keeps going and going, a great buy for the money."
5,GREAT CLIPPER,"Purchased these clippers to replace a portable/battery operated pair we had for a couple of years. These clippers work very nice and the color coding of the attachments helps also. The clipper has a little weight to it and had to adjust to being able to maneuver it due to the weight compared to the little portable clipper I had. All-in-all, this is a great clipper set."
4,Great for the price!,I have never used clippers to cut hair let alone ever cut someones hair. This comes with easy color coated guides. I have cut my son's and husband's hair so far and it has worked out great. Comes with a easy written guide too. Everyone thinks I did a great job and are actually surprised it wasn't done at a salon. I plan on doing my son's and husband's hair every time now. Great for saving money!
4,Great Product,"I purchased this; because I was tired of spending $9.99 each time, for just a buzz cut. I decided to give this a whirl and see if it is any good. After one cutting, I have no complaints. Very simplple to use, I was cutting MY OWN hair! By the way; I have not and plan not to use the cape, seems like a one-timer, I would rather pop a hole in a trash pag! It is good for the money with all the attachments."
3,I NEEDED EARPLUGS!,"THIS IS A DECENT HAIR TRIMMER WITH LOTS OF COMB ATTACHMENTS (LONGEST IS 1 INCH), BUT WHEN I TURNED IT ON, I THOUGHT SOMEBODY HAD FIRED UP A LAWNMOWER. THE MOTOR IS SO LOUD--SO OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD-- I HAD TO WONDER IF IT WAS FAULTY OR BROKEN (OR SOMETHING!!)CUTTING MY HAIR WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE DUE TO THE VOLUME OF THE MOTOR.WORKS GREAT-- IF YOU HAVE EARPLUGS!!"
5,Can't beat the value. Wahl quality is pretty darn good.,"For somewhere around $25 in price, this clipper set is phenomenal.The clippers do get warm when ran for a long time. Other than that, these have served me well for over 10 hair cuts so far and they still cut like new.This kit is very complete, with cutting oil and a cleaning brush as well as all the guards. The carrying case fits the whole set easily, but the guards could use a little organization. I just leave my extra guards in the plastic bag they came in and shove that bag in the case, but Wahl could have done a better job organizing these guards.Overall, well worth the money as this seems to be a durable, quality product."
5,wahl haircutting system,I bought these mostly for the name brand. I haven't had a chance to use them yet but I will very soon.
4,Wahl 79300 Home Pro 26-Piece Review,"Good product, comes with loads of useless goodies. I like the fact it comes with all the attachment combs. The larger attachment are a little flimsy. My biggest complaint is that the fader on the clippers doesn't adjust far enough."
4,Love the color coded system,This is a great hair clipping kit. The color coded system was very useful. The kit was very reasonably priced and arrived quickly. I only wish it would have come with a more organized case to be able to separate the pieces where it is not all thrown in together. Seems to cut well and I love the added ear and eyebrow guards.
4,Amazing Purchase,"By far one of the best purchases I ever made. A HUGE money saver. The variety of lengths and shapes of attachments allows you to cut your hair in just about any fashion, with ease, and quickly. It runs very smoothly, is not too loud, and is pretty ergonomic to fit your hand. The only complaint I could come up with is that sometimes the teeth of the attachments can get slightly malaligned while on the clippers, but even the manual will warn you of this and all you do is flick it with your finger and it snaps back into place. Other than that these clippers are magic and saving me a butt load of money"
4,Pretty good deal,"The comments about them being extremely loud are true. I often have to pinch the sides of the clippers (not sure why) to get them back to normal operation. Again, I don't know what causes it or why that helps, but it does. When not in ""high gear,"" though, the clippers work just fine. The color coding is nice, but some of the colors do not really match the color code on the clippers. The general color is there, but most are darker or lighter or a slightly different hue than the color code. That was frustrating at first, but now I've pretty much memorized which colors I use where and do not pay attention to the color code anymore."
3,"Cuts well, cheap plastic guards break","Cuts well, cheap plastic guards broke on first try. Nice soft touch feel and is pretty quiet for hair clippers."
2,Not rechargeable,Do be fooled by the website description. The clipper is not rechargeable. If you are looking for a cordless clipper. This isn't the right one either.The only good thing I could say about the clipper is that it looks durable and heavy duty. You might be able to mow your lawn with it.
5,Great Clippers,"I bought this pair clippers over 10 years ago, and they are still running strong. Just keep them oiled and you will have a great pair of clippers that will last generations (probably). They run just as good today as they did when I bought them."
2,Don't be fooled,"This clipper set looks and sounds nice, Not the case. It is no differant than any other cheap clipper you can get at walmart. This clipper will last no longer than a year if You use it a couple times a month. I have been using clippers for many many years and have learned that you get what you pay for. Last time I used these They cut my scalp in two places. No joke. If you want a good clipper that last stay away from magnetic motors. I recomend The Fast feed by oster. This clipper is a big step up for about 15.00 20.00 bucks more."
4,Does what it's suppose to.,"Right out of the box we started cutting the kids hair. There are some simple ideas included which helped. My wife did such agood job, I let her cut my hair and looks as good as my regular stylist which charges me $15. With 4 kids we now save about $70/month. I wish this review came later so I could tell you how long the blades stayed sharp. But for now, it's great."
5,great clippers,"i recieved these clippers and was very impressed. they are comfortable in the hand but most of all they give a perfect haircut everytime, because of the color coded blades there is no guessing.i love having these clippers."
1,Useless,This is a totally useless clipper. Dont buy it. I just wasted 30 bucks. It lacks enough power and does not cut but rips the hair out. Total waste of money.
1,Powpow,"This product is so noisy, I would not recommend purchasing this clipper.the manufacturer need to put a silencer on this device."
2,Poor long term performance,"I bought this to save money on haircuts since I just wear a crew cut. The cutters worked pretty good for the first year, but performance rapidly declined after that. The cutters must have dulled out quickly or something because it likes to rip the hair instead of cut it. It takes over 20 minutes going over the same spot multiple times to get a haircut now, and there are always lots of long hairs left over. Noise doesn't bother me...or my set was not as noisy as everyone else's. I would highly recommend spending a little more money and investing in a set of something more tailored to professionals like the Oster Classic 76 clippers instead."
2,Taking a loss on this one...,I ordered this as a temporary fix until I can order a better set at the next hair show. They didn't even edge well. The clipper guards were random the kit and looked pieced together from a variety of other kits.
1,Worst book I've read,"I saw a person online recommend this book and I read a lot of financial books and never heard of this book, so I thought I'd give it a try. I only could read half of the book and refused to read anymore. This is the first book in probably 5 years that I couldn't read the whole book, becuase I felt it was a waste of time.First the author says we should all be renters. Second he only advocates using CD as your investment. Then he talks about places that have a lower cost of living. What was considered lower cost of living in 1988 will not apply to 2006. Also the CD rate of 8% does not currently apply either.The book really doesn't teach you anything that you probably don't know from reading these other reviews. Save your time and your money. I read my copy from the library, but I want my wasted time back."
4,"$50/day was enough to get married, have family in 3rd world-","I was 38 years old, single, never married when I first read Paul Terhorst's book in 1988. I already had saved up a minor nest egg and Terhorst's often sarcastically amusing book convinced me to retire at age 40 to live in the third world (albeit with a slightly different investment mix than was recommended). Since then, I found that not only is $50.00 a day sufficient to live well, but it was enough to charm and marry a very attractive woman... and still is enough to support a small family here (my daughter was born in Chile)."
2,SO-SO,Not many creative ideas for those on limited assets and have kids.Good for individual or couple with at least 400k and no children needing college expenses from you
5,Relevant even 20 years old,This is a great book. Very good read. Lots of insights. The investment advice might be dated but everything else is very relevant.
2,An Outdated Book for the Rich and Healthy,"An interesting book, but really only workable if you have $400K--$500K in assets. What's worse, Terhorst assumes you'd be living off the interest generated by investing your assets in CDs earning a currently unheard of 8% interest.In addition, the book doesn't touch on health insurance. I'm guessing that when he wrote the book almost 15 years ago, health insurance was far more affordable than it is now. Either that, or he was assuming that you could self-insure if your assets were so high.I'd like to see this book updated for the 21st century--i.e. how to ""live off your assets"" when interests rates are 2% or less, and how to live on ""$50 a day"" (Terhorst's mantra) while still securing health care."
5,Best movie of all time? I think so,"I can't go through the Christmas season without watching Elf. Hilarious! One of my all time favorites! There are a few kissing scenes, but I still think it is acceptable for children"
2,talk talk,May as well buy a grays anatomy. Pictures minimal and loads and loads of words and more words.
3,"good book, SLOW TRANSACTION",took longer to get than any other book I 've ever purchased online. Wasn't sent out in a timely fashion. book is in good condition and I am satisfied with that part of the transaction.
5,Human Anatomy for Artists: The Elements of Form,"Excellent book, quick delivery at a competitive price. Excellent value. I'll use the book for years to come."
4,Definitely One of an Artist's Best Friends,"I bought this book for a sculpture course, as we were modeling the human body in plasteline clay from the skeleton out. The drawings and diagrams are extremely helpful, and the explanations of origin and insertion are simple enough that I didn't feel like I was reading out of some overwhelming, medical school grad's book. The only problem I had was that there were some minor muscles not covered in the book, so I ended up using another text book along with this one. However, the vast majority is covered in detail. If you're an artist and are looking to improve your understanding of human anatomy, or are simply an enthusiast, this book is a must have. I'm so happy I bought it in hardback, because I know I'll be using it for years to come."
5,The Standard.,"An excellent and detailed view of human anatomy written for artists but thoroughly scientific throughout. It's my preferred reference book as it doesn't get caught up in the artists personal style and keeps things usable. It also has a photo, a diagram and a description of every muscle so you can see the actual surface appearance as well as the simplified diagrammatic view."
2,Not as in-depth as I'd have liked,"This book seems as if most parts of it have been directly quoted out of Mary Wilson's ""Dreamgirl--My Life as a Supreme"". I read Mary's book first, and the parts in the Diana Ross book pertaining to the Supremes, almost all matched Mary's quotes, exactly.I didn't feel like I learned too much, and since this is an ""unauthorized"" biography, I feel that one cannot tell what is true or untrue. Of course, out of the 3 original Supremes, Diana was my LEAST favorite, so it doesn't upset me to read anything negative. After all, we are all human, and anyone who can't have ANYTHING written about them, cannot be human! At any rate, I was not too satisfied with the information I received from this book in terms of completeness."
5,True side of Ross,"This is a great and thorough read of the life and career of Motown's appointed DIVA, Diana Ross. I've never been very impressed by her, but she did have star power (not to say the others at Motown didn't because they most certainly did!) and the best supporter in the business: Berry Gordy. What is unfortunate is how she got to the star magnitude. Throughout the book I wondered why did it have to be this way. 20/20 hindsight, but I'm positive others at Motown were thinking the same thing. Quite an ugly mess behind the glamour and very unfortunate."
1,Diana Ross is great. This book is ridiculous!,"I am reading this book still, but I can see many things missed in it! Diana Ross is a great singer, he (J.Randy Taraborrelli) didn't show her career, her recordings, her prizes. I don't believe in all facts. I don't know what he thinks about Diana Ross, but he only showed facts unlikely! I like her, Diana is Diana, can you understand? Or don't you want understand?"
5,Good Quality,I bought this over a year ago. Installed it the week I received it and the car is running strong with no leaks ever since. Gaskets were good quality and fit the malibu perfectly.
2,not much support,"Swimsuit fit, but was flimsy in construction. Good design and colors. After one washing on delicate cycle, crotch tore."
4,Western Action,A great read for anyone who likes a real western.The fast pace story and action continue thru the whole book.The only problem I had with the book was that it made me thirsty!This is one I would like to see made into a movie.If you like westerns that take you into the story you willenjoy this one.
3,Yaqui Gold,This is a very hard to get ahold of western book. One of the writer's was Clint Walker who played Cheyenne for many years in the series of the same name.I will say it was an enjoyable story. But considering how much I anticipated it since I had hard time getting ahold of I will say let down. I will give it a 3 out of 5 stars; worth reading but not worth going out of your way for.
2,Sloppy and not so indepth,"Why was this book written? Didn't she cover all this in her last book? I felt I knew less about her than when I started? When she complained to Mitch Miller about singing all the crap she was given, he told her to talk to him when she was a millionseller. I guess she forgot to do that!"
5,Best of its kind,"Anyone who has every heard Rosemary Clooney sings knows there is no one else quite like her. And so it would follow that her memoir would follow suit, and it most certainly does. I cried, I laughed, I loved this book more with every page I turned. Kudos to Barthel for bringing Rosie's voice to the page, and rendering poetry from such a soulful, remarkable life."
3,Girl Has Had an Interesting Life,"While the first few chapters were slow going the book picks up both the pace and gets more involving as Ms. Clooney's involvement with the professional music industy increases.Ms. Clooney is very open and her stories on working with notable industry professionals-Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby as well as many others-make this a worthwhile read. The book has many subplots, the most interesting being her relationships with her mother and sister and her marriage to Jose Ferrer."
5,Wonderful bio,"One of the best autobiographies I've read! Warm, funny and very well written. Some passages are almost poetic, such as Rosemary's descriptions of her hometown and the Ohio River. I'm reading it for the 2nd time and still enjoying. An amazing adventure of ""Old Hollywood"" and and era of wonderful music! I couldn't put it down and found myself reading into the early morning hours instead of bedtime!...highly recommend!"
5,review,"danny mcbride is the man! this is the funniest show by far! wish it wouldn't have ended, hopefully they add on"
2,I don't recommend this scanner.,I previously owned a flat bed Microtek years ago and it's still working fine. Unfortunately I can't say the same about this model. The ADF constantly jams and the rollers were noisy. It jams at least once per scan and that's only with 5 sheets of paper. I had it replaced with a new one but it does the exact same thing so I'm returning it for an HP.
1,Huge disappointment!!,"I ordered this scanner for use at work to replace one that had to be at least 10-15 years old and barely functioned anymore. This scanner promised fast scanning speed and excellent quality scans, which is just what I was looking for. It proved to be the exact opposite - this scanner is EXCRUTIATINGLY slow and the scan quality is HORRIBLE. My old, half dead scanner worked WAY better than this one. Don't waste your time or money."
3,More Like a New Age/Spa CD,My primary intent in buying this CD was to add to my collection of CDs that I use for practicing Tai Chi (Yang Style). This CD was just too New Age like for my taste. I prefer music with more of an Asian sound for my Tai Chi practice. This CD would be more suitable to use for meditation or sleeping. If you like the New Age/Spa type of sound then this CD is one you may want to add to your collection.
3,sound level too low,The music is excellent but the recording volume level is much lower than standart on any other cd ; look like a copy of copies cd .
1,Spiru-Tein Products/Powders,"The one BIG problem I have with Spiru-Tein powders is that even though the packaging states they mix easily or instantly dissolve, or something to that effect, nothing could be further from the truth. After stirring, stirring, stirring, some of the power remains on top of whatever liquid (e.g. milk) you have mixed (or tried to mix) it with. I have even used an electric mixer to try and get it thoroughly blended and it still remains undissolved."
1,EGG-NOT,"This drink has a chemical taste. Hardly any egg nog flavor and, does not mix well even with a blender."
4,Great shaver,"I have owned several similar items in the past, and use them until they wear out. Wahl's have been great, so I don't expect anything less from this trimmer/shaver."
1,Wahl Bump-Prevent Shaver Trimmer,"Despite claim of ""no pull, no snag"" the unit does exactly that. Using the 3/16"" spacer, I had to stop using the unit immediately because of the hair pulling. I'm not surprised to see the unit is no longer made. Will toss this unit in the trash and try to find a better one."
3,Mis-represented?,"I just recently bought what I thought was a Wahl 9400 shaver. Upon receiving it I noticed on the battery compartment lid it said 9200. I emailed Amazon about this and have had no reply. Also, the base for the shaver and the accessories is a 'plumbers nightmare'- hardly anything fits the way it's displayed in the advertising. I have used it once with 'satisfactory' results. It's not as adaptable as my old Conair device, but it seems like it will be OK as I keep my beard really close. How it will do with a 'hair trim' will be forthcoming. So- guess the verdict is still out- as Paul Harvey used say- stay tuned for Page Two!"
1,sucked,quality isn't that good cant handle the power and speakers pop when in usewouldn't recommend wasting your money on these
1,Poor quality,I have a new pioneer in the mid range of models and when you turn it up distortion big time. I was told a amp may help but think twice before you try to save money with these.
1,Lasted one week!,I purchased these speakers for my sons birthday. He had them professionally installed. They lasted one week. Well the drivers door speaker lasted 7 days and passenger 12 days. I am now looking for Pioneer speakers for his truck.
1,Wrong application,This item was reccomended for my vehicle and it was the wrong fit. I sent them back and was credited for the refund as stated. I've now orderd the correct fit units and they are on the way. I like dealing with firms like this one.
2,pay a little more for something else,"You get what you pay for. 25 years car audio experience, I wanted a budget system for a back up vehicle. Better off spending a little more on something else, like Kicker or Lanzar. These may perform fair off just head unit power, avoid these if your running an amp. Ran these off an amplifier low-level line outs, the cleanest power option and results are minimal. Tweeters simply sound cheap and distort easily, mids are a bit better but not much. I knew Pyle was nothing but restamped Pyramid junk, but decided to gamble anyway. Photo of the mid-bass in photos is misleading, not at all a beefy speaker. grade ""D"", giving them 2 stars at best."
2,You get what you pay for,"Shipping was free and fairly quick. The component speakers work ok at lower volume, but cannot handle much with heavier music. They tend to distort easily with music such as Metallica, even at lower volume. The tweeters seem to do alright at any level. Mounts for the tweeters are cheap and break VERY easily. One was actually split when I opened the box. Crossovers do their job without a problem. Best application would be a set to buy your teenage son, explain how to take care of what you have and see how many days before he blows them, lol. Overall you get what you pay for, $37 for two entry level crossovers. Would suggest spending a little more money for a better product."
4,Pyle 6.5 component sys.,"I purchased these to replace the worn out speakers in my Silverado. The bass speakers fit perfectly and with a slight mod to the existing tweeter mount the new tweeters installed where the old ones were. For the price they sound good, slight improvement over the factory speakers. They do not produce a lot of bass but the highs are clear and I'm overall very happy with them and would recommend thrm as a budget replacement to original speakers."
2,not that great...,"I would not recomend these, the tweeters are poorly constructed and quite easy to burn out, the crossovers are quite poor and the 6.5"" drivers are very limited in range...i was running these on a cadence 4x50 Watt(rms) amp. (the Q4000) at a masured output of 41Watt RMS (as configured)... in only a few weeks i burned out all but one of the tweeters, and one of the crossovers... the crossovers are a 1st order LP 2nd order HP with a reistor in series with the tweeter... the LP inductor is a iron core wound with 22AWG wire, the hp inductor is at least an air core, but it's made with 26AWG wire... the tweeters mounts are all friction fit and fall apart very easy... the 6.5"" drivers are ok for upper midbass to low midrange, outside of this range it's responce gets quite eratic, and any bass below about 180 HZ will cause distortion across the rest of it's range... all in all these were not worth even the low cost i paid for them."
3,Ehhh,The Tweets are trash. Sounded horrible since the day I got them.But this kit is helluh cheap and sounds alot better than my old set up. I'm satisfied
3,low bass,I bought these speakers based on all of the reviews. The speakers are okay for the price but lack Bass. I had them installed professionaly and sound quality is good but again no bass. I am actually looking to buy another set of speakers for the same Honda Odyssey and give these away to my nephiew. Honestly speaking my factory speakers sound better than these in the Odyssey. I will just bite the bullet and buy better quality speakers for more money.
4,Pyle 400 Watt Speakers,"These are a good pair of speakers,I have installed alot of these and have done some remedial repair work on peoples cars who did nottake into account the depth of the speakers,cut holes in their door panels only to find they are too deep............if you have dont this the easy answer is to cut 'spacer' rings out of MDF which will allow these to fit correctly,just an opinion offered.Now these do handle amps VERY well and aslong as they are installed correctly there wont be any distortion so they are worth purchasing...........just plan ahead with the layout of your system,as with ANY speakers pay attention to the depth and measure before you cut so you can check they will fit where you intend to put them and not cause you any aggravation modifying the opening.Worth the price and will help your system with or without a seperate amp(depending on what internal power your head unit offers)"
2,Not worth it,"I got these as a replacement for my stock sound system, and plugged them right into my radio, no amps or anything. They worked fairly well for about 3 days and while driving on the highway,they farted out. a tweeter blew and they haven't sounded the same since. If you'll use them lightly, then go ahead. but otherwise be careful what you spend your money on"
3,average set of speakers,"Good for mids, not so good on bass. Stated it was compatable with my vehicle, but were too long on the back end, and to make some cuts, and mods. But other than that, a preaty good buy."
5,amazing quality for the price,Ordered this package for my 95 jeep grand cherokee along side the 3 way door speakers and I was astonished with the quality and kick these suckers give without an amp the only problems I had with it was the instalation because I had to drill holes in the door in order to mount it but all in all it is a great product if upgrading from stock and you can't beat spending less than a hundred bucks on a product that sounds like 200 bucks can't wait to get my door amp and 15s now :)
4,cool,"This was a fun project, I built a custom box for my truck (standard cab) and used these speakers because of the size. I wanted something that wouldn't sacrifice any leg room and add a little more acoustical depth to songs. The factory setup I had was about as bad as elevator muzak resonating in a tin can. I put time in building and carpeting the speaker box, I cut and mounted the tweeters into the door where the mirrors are, I'm happy and pleased with the results, the yellow speakers in a green carpeted box is aesthetically pleasing. The filters are a nice touch. I ended up using those filters in the door with a different set of speakers. the bottom line is these speakers won't win awards but are fair to replace factory speakers, and the audio did improve from what did I had. It did meet my expectations, if you are looking for quality, look somewhere else. If you have a scenario similar to mine, I would do it again."
2,...,It was not nearly what I expected they do not sound good my old speaker sounded better I would not buy them if i had it to do over again
4,Good Replacement for worn component type stock system,Ive installed these in my 2001 VW Passat. To get them to fit the Passat you need speaker adapters that extends them out far enough so that the speaker doesn't interfere with the window operation. I think the woofer is pretty much the equivalent of the OEM stock premium monsoon stock speaker that VW had in the passat. But VW Passat's OEM stock tweeter seemed more crisp than the PYLE so I just left my original tweeters in the car. But i have to say the crossover did seems to make my oem tweeters even more crisp than they were . Over all Im pretty please that I have a nice sounding system.Pyle PLG6C Custom Component Kit PLG6C
2,You get what you pay for...,"I purchased these as a temporary replacement for worn factory components until I could afford the much more expensive set I wanted. Just didn't expect them to be quite so temporary. Powered by a modest PPI amplifier (60x2) at reasonable volume, the tweeters lasted 8 days, the woofers followed a scant 4 days later. Found quality was poor, the tweeters harsh and overly bright, the woofers muddy and lacking in the upper midrange. I would have almost preferred the scratchy stock drivers. But for the price, they fill the holes. The Power handling claims are overrated. But in all, you get what you pay for."
3,componet system break down.,"it hooked up pretty good to my sony 100watt deck, i may add a 300watt amp, but it sound's good as as with 50/50 100watts coming on through! the little crossovers make thing's look so nice and Hi Tec, but there just connecter's."
1,junk,They are junk put them in sounded good but only lasted for two weeks then they just quit I bought these knowing that they are cheap and ill tell you you get what you pay for now I spent $50 on each h set of speaker Alpine and they sound good hopefully you read this and make the right choice the first ti
1,Good paper weight,Okay first of all they didn't fit...I checked the door speaker size and tried finding something cheap that'll fit. Bought these and they were to big. I decide to use a speaker for a small computer system I have that needed a new sub. Well these suck so bad the old broken speaker sounds better. I don't even use it as a paper weight because I am embarrassed I bought them.
3,Good for the price..,"You get what you pay for.. I am glad this came so cheaply and as a full set, I have worked with some pyle stuff before that was the same way I got what I paid for.. The tweeters and crossovers work amazingly, the mids seem to over push themselves and I only have a JVC 50 x 4 deck pushing them now this could be because of the fact they are running free air in my doors of an 07 cobalt which I had to drill and tap holes for the speakers to fit because everything about this cobalt has been a headache (thats another story) I have been just running them off the crossovers that come with the setup as well so only midrange is coming thru I think that the crossover may be set a little high gain high bass unfortunately I cannot adjust the crossovers which kinda sucks as well.. But the tweets sound rich and full.. Price is fair for the equipment you get.."
4,Jeep Speakers,Bought these for my son's jeep. He installed them into some boxes we made to fit in the back of his YJ. Good quality and good price.
2,all but tweeter work great,"tweeter worked for 20 mins then quit,too much b.s. to replace through here ,just wont buy again crossovers great ,subs great but 20watts and both tweeters quit after i cut holes in dash ,,not happy with that"
2,Incorrect fit,Reviewed the product before ordering with my car information and it said exact fit. but to my suprise upon installation the fit for my car was not as they said. So now i am return this product and trying to find another that really fits. It was a headache :(
2,tweeters are junk,"i recieved this item and noticed that one crossover had a crack in the outter plastic casing but installed it regardless and when i put it in, the tweeters didnt work, so i sent them back and got an exchange for the same system. after recieving that package i inspected everything and noticed that one of the wires to the cone on one 6.5 was not even connected.... value is not a reason to get these they are junk. i just bough the pyle dryver component set with the same things but a little more expensive. i hope that those dont let me down becaus i have always loved pyle products"
5,Lot better than OEM,Stock speakers died. Installed in a 2005 Chev Silverado 2500HD Crew cab.Front doors. Some drilling required for a tighter fit. I disassembled the tweeter to use the existing mounts a little RTV and done. Did not use the crossovers as I dont use an amplifier. Great sound at a low price.
3,No way it could handle 300 watts,"These are awesome for the price. I didn't expect them to but i got hopes up and they were crushed, they wouldn't handle 300 watts. but the sounded awesome on a 52 watt deck"
1,my last purchase with amazon,"BOUGHT THESE SPEAKERS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THEY WHERE NEW. TO MY SURPRISE THE TWEETERS WHERE ALREADY GLUED TOGETHER AND I CANNOT TAKE THEM OUT OF THE HOLE MOUNT CASE TO SWITCH THEM INTO THE FLUSH MOUNT CASE. NOW I GUESS I SHOULD TAKE MY REAR DECK OUT OF MY CAR AND PREY WHEN I INSTALL THE USED SPEAKERS THEY WILL WORK. NOT. I WILL EASIER THROW THEM OUT AND SAVE MYSELF THE HEAD ACHE. BUYER BEWARE OF AMAZON CROOKS, DON'T NO WHO'S FAULT THIS IS BUT I AM NOT HAPPY. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. I WILL NO LONGER DEAL WITH AMAZON SHOPPING."
1,Four Blown Tweeters,"I purchased two sets of pyle PLG6C component speakers and hooked them up to a kenwood 150x2 amp. System sounded good for about a day and a half and then the tweeters started blowing left and right. I checked the X-overs and they were fine, I then preformed a resistance check with my ohm meter and all 4 tweeters tested out of limits. Diagnois 4 blown tweeters!I contacted PYLE (the name says it all) and they wanted me to send the blown tweeters back and pay for shipping both ways=$30.00 Why just so i could blow them again? Screw that. So much For the 200 Watt RMS power rating. Probably ok to run just off the recievers power but if you plan on running an external amp forget it."
2,All around bad,"The price is a dead give away. I got the speakers installed them and less than two day's later the 1"" blew. The speakers come with wire that is about 16 gauge and cheap. Don't get these speakers."
5,Pretty damn good for 35 bucks,"I purchased 2 sets of these for my work van, I must say im impressed.Sound great, well made , If you want to spend alot of cash then dont buy theseIf your looking to save (these speakers are a 1/3 of everyone else) then stopthinking and buy em, I have a Kenwood set with Kenwood deck in my other truckAnd the pyles are just as good, (they even came packaged better) .so my final word! excellent job Pyle!"
1,No stars. Why can't I give NO STARS!,Item not as described. Misleading. Each speaker is 200w MAX Leave it be. Not worth the hassle. Don't bother. Leave.
4,Great product at a great price,"These speakers look great and include a screen cover that is not pictured. I installed them in about 25 minutes including the time to, remove the door panels, remove the old speakers and break the wire harness/plugs for the stock system. I di not install the crossovers yet or the supplied tweeters but am confident that all will be easily installed when the time is right. Good instructions are included and the panel/cut-out template was very helpfull. Product was shipped very rapidly and received early. thank you."
4,Not too bad,I ordered this set to be a temporary fill in untill I could save some money up for a higher price set but I must say I have been suprised at the sound this set produces I am running it off a RF 125.2 amp and they sound very decent.
4,PYLE DRIVERS,"This Pyle 6 1/2 Speaker Component Kit is well worth the money. Installation in my 94 Suburban was straight forward. All mounting hardware is included. The Tweeter setup is pretty neat with options for installation and mounting. I was especially impressed with the quality construction of the cross-over. These are great sounding speakers for the money; decent highs and mid bass. I installed these Pyles in conjunction with an 8""sub and bridged Amp off the head unit.I also have two Pyle 4x10's in the rear. The total sound is awesome!"
3,Not bad for the money,"I bought this package to replace a blown 6 1/2"" mid range speaker in my door. These are hooked up to a separate amp for the door woofers. I expected the speakers to be bassier and have more ""kick"" than they do. But hey, I got 2 woofers and two tweeters for about $39! I guess they are no too bad for the price."
5,dalom kids &Splash Collection,"As always, the same great old Hit Machine splashing the hits.You wanna be on the dance floor all nite long? then this is the one for you!Batswana love you Oom Dan.Batswana love Splash and Dalom Kids.KEEP ON DISHING GOOD MUSIC. WE WANNA BUY IT!"
1,"Hermetic in many places, rairly Jewish","The author shows some knowledge of Jewish sources in the book but seems to be totally ignorant of many others. One very telling quote is when he's talking about pairs in reference to the hour of mars on tuesday and he says ""...will recognise that the Talmud considered even numbers to be unfortunate."" If he could read the commentary that went along with the section he would have referenced the information on Zugos and where/why they are important. The amount of things that he left out that are elementary are a testiment to why I give this book such a low rating. Of course his Hermetic talk on Kabbalah rather than going to the Jewish sources is just another nail in the coffin."
2,A Misleading Title,"The first edition of this book, released before the current resurgence of interest in Kabbalistic literature, did not contain the word 'Kabbalistic' in the title. If you look at the table of contents you will understand why since the Kabbalah is not mentioned anywhere in the book's 22 chapters!! I admit the author has some interesting things to say about how astrology relates to the Midrash, Talmud etc., but those who are expecting a book whose primary focus is on the Kabbalistic interpretation of astrology will no doubt feel as disappointed and mis-led as I do now. Should have kept the original, more honest title 'Astrological Secrets of the Hebrew Sages'."
1,DONT BELIVE THE PRODUCT DETAILS,VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT INFORMATION BECAUSE THE DETAILS SAID CLEARLY LANGUAGES SPANISH AND IS NOT TRUE JUST ENGLISH AND FRENCH. FOR MY CHILD OF 5 THE DVDS ARE TOTALLY USELESS
3,I'm getting this 4 Christmas,"Hi Everyone. I'm getting this for Christmas. Everyone says that this game is sooooo cool, but I'll find out the truth on December 25. You'll hear from me then.HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE"
2,great while it worked,"This is easy to use as most reviewers note, however, ours stopped working after a few months of use. Just won't come on anymore. Yes, we've put new batteries (lots of those when it worked) to no avail. We've since purchased a Sansa which we are currently happy with, but only had for two months. I'll write a review for that once we've determined that it's reliable."
3,Not a review but a marketing concern,"Amazon bodly proclams:List Price: $179.99Price: $85.99Shipping. See detailsYou Save: $94.00 (52%)Availability: Usually ships within 1 to 2 days from Amazon.comYou can buy the same item at Creative's own online retail store for $89.99. They do not post a list price but if the manufacture is selling them for $89.99, to me that is a $4.00 savings or a 4% savings!!!"
1,"Works great for a while, then...","I had mine for less than a year and treated it kindly. Then one day, for no apparent reason, it wouldn't work. It kept saying ""file system error."" I tried to reformat it from the Creative website, but it still wouldn't work. I'm sending it back to (hopefully) get fixed. From what I've read, this problem is happening to a lot of people."
4,Note on lifespan of electronics,"Jeff Jeff mentioned that he ""only"" got 7 months of life from his Muvo. Excuse me, but you're buying a low-grade high-tech product that probably only cost $20 to make and you want long life? Either use a credit card that automatically extends the warranty of items you purchase, or acknowledge that consumer electronics now have lifespans measured in months, not years. Use and toss might not appeal to you, but it's the new paradigm. Just be careful to recycle any potentially toxic bits in the contraptions that die."
4,Definitely a great buy!!!,"I rated this item a 4 out of 5 because nothing is perfect. nonetheless, to transfer music files from your computer to the MP3 player is super fast. The sound quality is excellent. I have nothing bad to say about this product. The only negative is that it hold only about 70 songs, depending on how long each song is. It's very small and can fit on your keychain, pocket, etc.. I highly suggest that everyone buys this product!!!!"
4,Nice Little Player,"After reading alot of reviews i finally decided to buy this Creative Labs Muvo TX 256.After 10 hrs of using it ,i have to say its a GREAT player.Had a few difficulties with skipping between folders initially,seems we have to get used to the scroller,now its okay.ProsSound Quality .Backlit display is great.FF and Rewind .Instant recognition of the Player when inserted to the USBport (XP).Software provided seems to be good.ConsFound difficultis skipping between folder.no case provided as mentioned in Package content.Volume level could be higher for maximum volume level."
2,"Great for the first 7 months, but.......","This was a great little MP3 player. Great sound, my wife loves the portability in the gym, but after 7 months of normal wear, the display stopped working. Worse yet, I call Creative and they tell me it's not under warranty anymore. They said the warranty was for 90 days!Huh? The rep at Creative said they'd give me a ""discount"" and only charge me $45 to fix it. I asked for him to please talk with his manager about this problem. He said he'd call me back today, but I'm still waiting.Beware ... Creative products look great, they sound great, but clearly they not only don't hold up well, but also don't have the type of support you expect to have from Creative. Sad."
2,Failed after 6 months,"I really enjoyed using this during workouts- portable, sound was decent, and it was easy to use. However, the other day it just stopped working. I got a ""File System Error"" in the display window. So, I pulled out my manual and sure enough, there was a suggestion on just how to fix that error- reformatting the unit. HOWEVER, that didn't work!! I plugged the USB in and the device shows up on the computer, but that's it. Can't reformat, can't do anything. Creative's website didn't offer any more suggestions on what I should do, either.If you want a player that's going to last a while, don't choose this one. Spend the money and get a higher quality unit."
3,Good info..but come on now...get real,"Great infomation about Gems he does discuss, however M. Katz leaves out many healing stones. Also, I disagree that you have to buy His necklaces to have ""real healing"". People ill with cancer and other serious illnesses im sure do not have the money to buy his most excellent quality necklaces. When a person is really ill, they are not working, so it would be hard, unless you have lots of money aside to purchase these ""theraputic gems necklaces"".I have worked with reiki and with stones and oils. I have seen marvelous healings done with a regular ROCK. I think hes fattening his wallet. Period."
2,Very incomplete information - not for the serious energy medicine practitioner,"I was dissapointed with this book. It lacks ANY information about many common gems, including jade, obsidian, black tourmaline, moonstone, etc. This is a ""glossy"" book designed to attract the new age crowd who may just have a passing interest and want a VERY basic introduction. However, for anyone who is serious about gem and energy medicine, especially naturopaths or others interested in making gem elixers, I would NOT recommend this book. It simply lacks enough complete information."
5,A Book that Can Transform You & Your LIfe,"What a beautifully written, and inspiring ""call to compassion"" this book is! Aura Glaser presents nothing less than the revolutionary idea that Freud and Jung stopped short of exploring the power of compassion in the true transformation of suffering. It took an accomplished psychologist, teacher and Buddhist practitioner, someone with 25 years of meditation experience, to call us to experience a total, radical replacement of our troubled minds and closed hearts, with wisdom and compassion. Her eloquent voice, her depth of insight into Freud's and Jung's work, her easy way with the wisdom tales of old, and her obvious clarity and fullness of heart shine through on every page. She weaves an exquisite tapestry of erudite and practical understanding, using myths and stories, and offering big-hearted solutions and understanding of how we can come into our wholeness. I unequivocally, whole-heartedly love and recommend this book.Rochelle Winter, M.S.W."
5,One in a Thousand,"I selected this after viewing over 1000 handbags. It met all of my qualifications: beautiful style, excellent black leather, room for essentials but not enough to overload. It is handsome and comfortable on my shoulder. The strap does't fall to the floor when I'm seated at a restaurant but hovers above the zipper because the footed bottom lets the bag stand."
3,trimmer wont shut off,"it doesnt matter which way you put in the battery, it turns on, the on-off switch doesnt turn it off, sent back to wahl, new one does the same thing"
1,you get what you pay for,This is a piece of c_ _ p!!!!!It does poorly for my husband's ear hair. Then I tried it on my yorkie's face then feet. It did less than a poor job. Wish I had not purchased this product.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A BETTER ONE!!!!!!
2,Very limited use.,"We purchased this product to trim around eyes, toe pads and bottoms on our tiny toy dogs. We thought this would fit the bill and be quiet enough not to scare the dogs. It is fairly quiet but it just doesn't trim well. It's very hard to get it to cut our dogs' hair. Our dogs have fine, almost human hair like fur. It just doesn't cut well. We usually try using this first and then end up grabbing the scissors. It does seem to help get out the occasional mat if used with enormous patience and a certain technique."
3,good but loud,"i had gotten this trimmer to replace the con-air one because it had gotten to the point where the switch had broken so you had to hold the battery to get it to work. this trimmer works as well as my old one but there are a few things i didn't like. one was it was considerably louder than than my old one, and there is a brush built in to the handle and it would get snagged on my hand and fall out. other than those two things it feels exactly like my old one"
1,ITSOKAYTOMAKEMISTAKES,This was a very exciting book about a team of SAS soldiers in Russia. Ryan certainly lives up to his standards.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Check out that title. Those guys, Aragones and Evanier, pretty funny eh? Like that would ever happen. He must be sick, or taken over, or replaced , or something, because he starts sounding like his brain must be functioning.This draws anybody and everybody that Groo has beaten up, destroyed, maimed or stressed in the past to come and find out what the hell is going on."
1,Never again! Nasty color and not much vanilla flavor.,"Well, another failure for Spiru-tein. I guess a lot of folks might like this one, butI just couldn't get on board!Now, let me say that I do love Spiru-tein. They have some great flavors (not this one),and you can't beat the nutrition in the shakes.HOWEVER - whose idea at the company was it to make a vanilla shake green?!?Was someone feeling a little Irish that day?""What color should we make the vanilla shake Erin?""""Well duh - booger green, of course.""(See photos.)They lost me on this one. It was like a cruel joke in my cup. When I want a vanillaprotein shake, I don't want a bubbling green cauldron. It would make a great Halloweentrick drink, daring some unsuspecting child to take a drink of the brew before him/her.Meanwhile, I'll keep looking for a great vanilla protein shake. Spiru-tein has the nutrition,but it doesn't help much if you can't get it down. *shudder*"
3,"Great show, but poor treatment!","My Favorite Martian is a great show, but this is one cheap DVD release! The episodes are edited and the package is cheap!By the way, Amazon, it's not My Favorite Martian:Complete Second, it's My Favorite Martian - The Complete Second Season! TITLE IT PROPERLY!!!Amazon also incorrectly said it was in Color, it is not, it is in Black & White! GET IT TOGETHER AMAZON!"
3,Double sided discs can be a problem,"My first copy of My Favorite Martian Season 2 had some problems with freezing and skipping on one of the double sided discs. Would not play on most of my many DVD players.Fortunately, I returned them to amazon and the second copy was OK. The show should be 5 stars as it is a beloved classic. Some transfers however have some shaking areas. Still worth buying however as this is the best we will ever see."
2,Third season WAS produced in Color,The third season was produced in Color. How do I know? I own the VHS box set released in the early 90's that contains all 32 third season shows IN COLOR. The first two seasons were produced in black and white.
1,My Favorite Scam !,"That's right ! , fans do not purchase this set it is a DOG , no insults to dogs but any way do not waste your hard earned cash you are honest and would expect Rhino to do the same , NOT !"
3,An old friend,"Some of the criticisms made by other reviewers on this page are beyond my knowledge to evaluate. I found the DVD set to have good quality production values. ""My Favorite Martian"" is a great old time series with lots of gentle humour, not the in-your-face style that is so popular today, a pleasant change."
2,close only counts in handgrenades!,"The book was helpful in helping us select hikes. Accuracy was a problem, on one hike the starting point was misstated by 5 mi. This coupled with virtually no trail markings in Colorado, made our hikes frustrating. The 'author' is a photographer who should have collaborated with someone for accuracy. Get better maps and descriptions of individual hikes before you set out."
1,Sketcher,"There are some great things about this set. The numerous wells and compact size for one. BUT, when I took it out for a test drive on location, I picked it up out of my pack to open it and the bottle fell off. It does so every time I pick it up. I thought maybe I had the bottle in wrong, but after close examination didn't. So I'm giving it one star since it's fairly useless in it's functionality. I guess I'll put some kind of strap around it. Also the brush doesn't have a cap of any kind, so is loose in the kit allowing the hairs to get bent. Now it's permanently bent from being stored that way previous to my getting it. I'm quite disappointed."
1,Where's the new rock album were all waiting for ?,"Same old boring 10 songs or so .......... I want to hear a great CD of new material from these guys ! Scorpions have good album out right now ! Not to mention DDY's "" 100 Years From Now ""They have material from Cyclorama and Brave new world ? Why don't they add some of those tracks to their set list . Sorry this CD is nothing other than another live CD to make some more $ .........."
1,Pretentious to the max,Using an orchestra to play Styx songs is like using a cello to shovel manure.
4,Good effort - interesting approach,"While I find the proliferation of live albums by Styx in recent years a bit tiresome, One With Everything is better than most said albums. The fusion of veteran rockers with enthusiastic teenaged orchestra members is a fresh and interesting approach to the rock band/symphony trend. Just Be was pleasant. Everything All The Time is a terrific rocker - the kind that makes one want to turn his car stereo up really loud. There's enough other new live material to make it a worthwhile addition to any Styx fan's collection. That said, I also find myself wishing they would get away from the live and cover albums and produce a good run of original music."
4,another perspective for Styx,This is fine for those who enjoy classic Styx rock and want to listen to it in another way. Perhaps the DVD would be better.
4,Very good,"""Just Be"" is a great new song.The DVD is even better. You can see the fun and excitement in all the performers.If you like Collective Soul's ""Home"", you'll probably like this, and vice versa."
5,AWESOME,Styx performing with youth orchestra ROCKS the house down! This was on HDNET and I wish I had DVR'd it. Now it's my turn to make the purchase. I can't wait to hear it again. Get yours!
2,Small and Overpriced Discontinued Toy,"This Lego set came out a few years ago and it is because it has been discontinued that it costs so much through Amazon's third-party vendors. The toy itself is fine, but it is very small and overpriced unless you're desperate to add it to a collection."
2,Itty bitty lego knights bus,Don't make the mistake I did--this is not the full mini-figure sized Knights Bus set. This is an itty bitty Mcdonalds give-away set that makes an itty bitty knights bus. Not worth the money.
1,DO NOT BUY!!! PLEASE READ,I thought this was a mistake when I received a Happy-Meal-Size tiny bag of legos for over $50 dollars. This is not the regular size lego Harry Potter bus! It is someone's poor idea of a future 'collectible' pre-inflated in price beyond belief! I bought this as a birthday gift for a disabled boy and have a very unhappy child. Please do not send this vendor any orders- they do not deserve to be an amazon marketplace vendor. I have complained to both the vendor and amazon for promoting such a rip off for which I would not pay $5. Truly it is over $50 for a happy meal prize.
1,Don't buy this product,It is a discontinued item that some would think is the recently released product. It is small and way over priced. I intend to return this as soon as I confirm it is not the one my granddaughter wanted
1,are you kidding,"I ordered this without carefully reading the description (dumb on my part,I know) I think I just figured $34 would buy a decent Lego product I didn't realize what this was. This is the size of a McDonald's Happy Meal Toy and I just paid $34!! I am really really disappointed and will be returning the item immediately pending approval of course. Which of course drives me nuts!!!"
3,Harry Potter Knight Bus,I was disappointed when this product came in a cellophane bag instead ofa box. Made an error when ordering.
1,Seller Rip Off - Not as advertised,"This is a tiny miniature, this wasn't advertized as a mini toy. Sucks and costs much more than the real, new one which is much bigger. Buyer beware..."
4,"Maps, and size, are important; hence Michelin green","We are just back from a trip which included London. As always, Michelin is the best at having handy maps of districts you are interested in exploring. And the size fits nicely in a coat pocket. But, as my wife said, the descriptions are not inspiring. I find the maps and portability matter while on a trip. But for planning, maybe something else might be better."
2,Not that helpful,"Michelin guides are thought to be very good guides, that's why I bought the London Michelin green guide before I visit London. Unfortunately, the guide of London - at least - is not helpful. The subjects are organised in alphabetical order and not in routes! Moreover, there is not in it a plan of the underground, so you need an extra map to organise your plans depending on the tube stations. Besides, the information given on the monuments some times are not correct."
3,First impression - London Green Guide,"This is a premature general review. I am currently going through the guide, the visit in London is projected for end-September.This seems to be a very comprehensive guide, providing a great deal of historical information.Insofar as museums are concerned, I would have preferred more details on artists' works of particular importance and interest, at the expense of the quite extensive background and general information provided in this guide. I cannot imagine being able to take time to absorb such information, even if read on the eve of the visit in the museum itself, certainly not on the spot; I would want then to know what to look for and pay special attention to in specific exhibit."
1,OMG!!,"I purchased this set because of the brand. I've always been drawn to using wahls products, so I felt even though it was cheap it would be great...... Definately not! I so wouldn't recommend anyone to purchase it. Sorry to bring down any high hopes"
3,Order earplugs too,"I cant believe how loud this thing is. Its not annoying loud, its deafening loud. I mean its really, really loud. It does a good trimming, but its really, really loud."
5,Long Lasting,I have used these clippers two to three times a month for the last 2 years. Great investment. It has more than payed for it self.
1,disappointing,"This is the same model number as my wonderful old Wahl HomePro, purchased about 8 years ago, but now the quality of the manufacturing is pathetic. All of the accessory parts are flimsy and cheap. The motor on the new one quit halfway through the first haircut. The only thing wrong with the old one was that the blades had chipped, so I put the blades from the new unit on the old device and threw the new one away."
3,Too Noisy,"It does the job well, but way too noisy. Would not have bought it if I heard it at work prior to the buying decision."
1,Not useable,"A very bad clipper that can hardly cut a follicle of hair. After first trial, i had to abandon it and only use the comb and scissors. Not recommending it as it's not value for money"
4,Good Haircutter,"Apart from being a little bit heavy, this hair-cutter works very well. The accesories going with it are of much usefulness. In sum, this is a good product with acceptable price."
2,You get what you pay for,Does not cut hair cleanly. Ends up pulling at hair and requires multiple passes.
1,Messed up my hair!!,"I had to reedit my review after months of having the product I now feel confident in writing a review, First off, I put a clip on the clipperssize 1/4.I cut my hair and when you have a clip on the clippers its as easy as moving the clippers all across your hair, well for some reason it did not help it ruined my hair and i had to cut it down to a zero, I had lines in my head and the cut was so uneven, I would not do this ever again.I also dont recommend this product to anybody."
1,Bad choice,This kit is made in china.The Clipper vibrates a lot and makes loud noise.Numbs hands and the head on which it is used alike.Returned to Amazon after first attempted use.
3,FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY,"I saw a Wahl clipper at Big Lots that looked exactly like this and the label on its package says, ""Made in China."" It is priced for $12.99. I still gave it a rating of three stars because I know it is also a good product despite its country of manufacture."
1,Misleading Item,"This machine works good however, it is not what I expected. The item is misleading. It does not indicate anywhere in the text that this machine is non-adjustable. The blade cannot be adjusted on the machine and this is a major flaw in the design. I would not recommend this machine for anyone who is looking for a machine that can be adjusted."
1,Nope,No it hasnt worked because I cant remember to use it alkd jakj ajkaj jaklfj ajfkla ajfaklj ajafk aljaf fakl
1,save your money,"If you are a boomer growing concerned about remembering where you left your keys, don't waste money on this book. Perhaps this was written for the very elderly who have never learned to improve their self-esteem, but that's old news for boomers. This book is very poorly written (the grammar is atrocious) -- it shows that anybody can write a book in these days of desktop publishing and cheap printing. It is filled with clap-trap, and never delivers what it promises to sell. Two thumbs down!"
4,One of the better memory improvement programs,I am a medical professional and have been interested in memory improvement for years. I have followed the research faithfully since a parent was diagnosed with dementia. I found the memory workbook to be very up to date on the current research and more importantly understandable and usable. It is based on research and provides a comprehensive program for memory improvement. Highly recommended!
5,Artdolls,This is Jack Johnston's best work. I have read everything he has written and find this one amazing. If you make dolls you must read this book.
3,Northwest Airline plane,"My son doesn't use this as a toy, but as a decoration in his bedroom. He collects all the planes that we have ridden on at least one time."
3,Grainy,"This looks like it's from the days of VHS and 250 lines of resolution. On any kind of high def monitor, it looks pretty bad. That being said, it's a fine product, and will look fine on an older TV."
5,Multiple purpose cabinet,Great cabinet! Love the adjustable shelves. Placed it on the marina dock and holds up great to the elements.. I recommend this product highly
4,Very good for a plastic cabinet,"About as sturdy as I can imagine a plastic cabinet being. Not nearly as sturdy or capable of holding as much weight as a metal or wood cabinet. But the specifications of the shelves for 75 pounds seems realistic. I bought it for my garage, where wood or metal would be problematic over the long term, and it seems perfect for what it is. Assembly was pretty easy. No complaints."
1,Smaller than expected,The dimensions of this cabinet were much less than I was anticipating- I had measured out for a specific item to fit on a shelf and allowed for the shelves to be 6 inches smaller just in case the dimensions listed were just accounting for the frame. The shelves were still no where near correct- the item will not even fit just on top of the cabinet. The top shelf will also sometimes fall unexpectedly (but only the top shelf) so I do not recommend putting anything heavy on this shelf.
2,Not what i ordered :(,"The cabinet is working fine however, i paid $169.00 for a new item and it appears used (staining on the shelves). The exterior of the box looked ok but when i opened it the accent color on the handles was not royal blue (which i specifically ordered to match my other pieces). I am keeping the cabinet because it's easier than shipping it back. Overall, not a good experience."
2,Poor COnstruction,"I purchased one locally and could not get another to match so ordered unit from Amazon. The unit came broken, but I was able to construct without broken part. The whole unit was warped and would not fit together well because moulded pieces would fit into each other. It took 3 hours to contruct whereas the original NOT FROM AMAZON was put together in 20 minutes."
2,"good idea, poor execution","I got this for my after school program. Some of the kids like card captors, but they didn't like this game. A monopoly format or some other type would've been better. They found it to be a boring game. The Powerpuf Girls regular and Monopoly as well as Pokemon Master Trainer and Monoploy games are wildy popular. Too bad, maybe next time."
1,Boring,"I bought this game hoping for some fun, but it was boring and the game instructions are not well written. Now the game is sitting under my bed waiting for a garage sale."
3,Helpful but Dated,"My friends and I got a lot of use out of this tablecloth, initially. I shared it with some experienced Bridge players, however, and they said that it was very dated. I still find it helpful to have the reminders in front of me, but need to be careful not to follow it precisely."
3,Bridge Coaching Tablecloth,"I ordered both the Bridge Party Tablecloth for $29.95 and the Bridge Coaching Tablecloth for $31.95. I received 2 of the same thing. I'm not sure what the difference should have have been. I actually have not used them yet, but I think they will be helpful when playing."
1,Could have been shorter - BORING,"I enjoyed the first half of the book, but quickly got bored and gave up 2/3 of the way through it. From the other reviews, it didn't get much better near the end. The book could have been 150 pages shorter. Nice pink & gold cover tho'"
2,you can do better than that...,"This is actually my first Danielle Steel book. I like the book in the beginning, but soon I got bored. Paris is a ""sad"" character. It seems to me she forgives her unfaithful husband too easily. Maybe it's just me, but i was expecting to see more emotion then the ""wanting him back"" and ""missing him"". Being an independent woman, this book irrates me. I respect housewives, however there are so many other things to enjoy, why does a woman have to find her own self worth in raising kids and running a family, like Paris? There are p-l-e-n-t-y things she could do to make herself happy.... this book is kind of a set back for all the women."
2,Filler,"Years ago I was enthralled with Danielle Steel, after all, everyone dreams of a love story, even with the drama. However, I grew tired of the same descriptions of the characters, repeated storylines interwoven. I stopped reading her books. Then I saw this one, read the online reviews, and excitedly purchased it. I wish I could say I loved it. After being in the dating world forever, I certainly laughed at some of her awful dates, but it feels almost insulting to have every paragraph repeat the one before, or to repeat what the character is thinking a page later, only with different words. I wish I had loved it, I just was frustrated, and three-quarters of the way through, I jumped to the end."
4,Finally.....not the same old book!,"After reading all of DS books....I finally happened upon one that DOESNT sound just like all the rest of them. Yes - Paris' husband leaves and yes- she tries to pick up the pieces, but this book not only had a dramatic ending, it didnt leave me bored halfway through. The twist on the plot was refreshing, and the addition of Paris' children kept it moving at a good pace."
1,The Dating Game,I did not like this audio book.Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story.In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again.It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man. It tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again.
2,Dating Game,Boring! I have read all of Danielle Steel's books and this has to be the most boring of all of her novels. I skipped many paragraphs while reading it. It was very predictable. I hope her next novel is better.
2,Adoption irritated me,"First of all, as an adoptive mother, this book really gave me the creeps. It is not easy to adopt a child when you are a middle aged single parent--there are thousands of younger married couples competing with you. It was wayyy too easy and fast. Secondly, it didn't seem that Paris had a huge desire to be a mother again--it seemed more that she wanted companionship. Thirdly, it may be old fashioned but I think kids need fathers. The dating stuff was pretty funny and a welcome change from most of her books which deal only with perfect romances. I would not be surprised to see Ms. Steel turn up totin' an infant after reading this book."
1,"Bored rich women of the world, get dogs!","I must agree with the reader who just wanted to scream ""Get a dog!"" The first half of the book was good, and I sympathized with Paris.Then she moves to a new city and a great job falls in her lap. After a few bad dates and failing to make any real friends, she decides that she needs a baby. Never mind that it is mentioned over and over again that she works such loooooong hours, often getting home after 10:00 PM. Never mind that in real life, nobody gets to adopt a healthy infant within two weeks. Never mind that all Paris needed to do was *get a life*!All I got out of this book was the lesson that I really need to try reading something with more substance."
1,"HANG IT UP, DANIELLE!","DANIELLE STEEL DID HER BEST WORK YEARS AGO. HER CURRENT BOOKS ARE REPETITIVE WITHIN THEMSELVES AND WITH EACH OTHER. THERE IS NO EXCITEMENT TO HER STORIES. THERE IS NO URGENCY TO READ THEM. THE ENDING IS OBVIOUS, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF GETTING THERE. ACTUALLY, THIS STORY WAS A YAWN AND ONLY MILDLY AMUSING THANKS TO BIX MASON. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SPEND A COUPLE OF YEARS ON A NOVEL INSTEAD OF TURNING THEM OUT EVERY SIX MONTHS AND THEN PERHAPS MORE DEPTH IN HER STORY LINE CAN BE ACHIEVED. I THINK THAT THE TALENT IS STILL THERE, IT JUST NEEDS TO BE RE-AWAKENED..."
3,I think I read this a few years ago.,"As a life long D.S. fan it pains to say this, Danielle new material please, I find myself hoping that something other than her husband leaving,children growing up will happen to Paris. I think we die hard fans have sung this song before. But has a devoted I'll keep buying them.....JUst please something different."
5,Enjoyable as always!,"""Dating Game, by Danielle Steel is a fun story and it was as enjoyable as I thought it would be!"
2,Ho Hum...........,"If you've never read a Danielle Steel book before you probably would think this is quite a juvenile book.I wonder when Ms. Steel will go back to writing mature love stories like she did many years ago?So much repetition of phrases, everyone is either handsome or pretty in the books she writes and they usually have money. The story lines are interchangeble; just change the character names.The book is quick reading, but ultra-light in content."
2,"Extremely Disappointed, couldn't even finish it.","My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. I was always more for historical romances. But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very ""history lesson-ish"") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, ""So what?"". Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. I honestly expected more from a bestselling author."
5,Great source of entertainment for anyone on the rebound,"If you've just dumped someone, been dumped, or are for some other reason back on the market, I highly recommend this book, which will help you get your mind off your own worries and see the whole ""dating game"" for the entertaining circus it really is.I also highly recommend a new little book I just read called ""Meeting, Mating and Cheating,"" a real-life account of people all over the world who have played the online dating game! It's hilarious!"
4,Lois & Clark - The New Adventures of Superman - The Complete First Two Seasons (12pc),For fans of Lois and Clark it was a trip down memory lane!!! i loved the fact that you can buy the 2 seasons together but i can't wait to get the next 2 seasons. if you are a fan of smallville and you were too young for lois and clark it is worth a look. (and Dean Cain is so cute as superman/clark aswell!)
4,Superman,i loved this series when i was a kid i wish they would have made a fifth season the only think i wanted was more detailed special features
4,good product,good product like advertised. the injector worked great out of the box with no problems I would return back to buy more next time
2,"Small, but uncoated - taste like iron","These are not coated, so even though they are small, I can't bring myself to swallow them. They taste like iron, which reminds me of the taste of blood. It's hard to get rid of that disgusting taste even if you swallow these down as fast as possible. I haven't used up much of the bottle, but I'm giving up on them and getting some encapsulated iron!"
4,"It is ""OK""","I would have to say that the best part of the toy was building it. It took me 8 hours strait to build it, but I enjoyed every minute of it. I did find, though, that when I was done, the fun quickly died. All you can do is watch it go up and down, up and down.I recommend this product to a person who likes to build coasters (RCT game) or likes building K-Nex. It is fun at the beginning, but I lost interest in it in 3 days. Good Luck."
5,Great reinforcement for the budding engineer,"I never understood the lure of plain old plastic building toys, but I wanted my math-smart 13 year old to experience the challenge of building a model. The sheer size of the project was the source of some of the initial intrigue, but as my daughter built it, the anticipation of completion became stronger. As she was adorning it with the little flags and the serpent head, several kids in the neighborhood happened to come by. The little geniuses worked together to complete the finishing touches and turned on the motor with great expectations. It worked! Someone bumped something and it needed to be adjusted, so there was more intense discussion as they fixed it. I was thrilled that the entire project was done by a girl with no previous interest or experience with K'nex. I can't resist turning the thing on when no one is around."
1,Missing pieces,"This item was ordered with express delivery which meant more money for shipping. The item arrived a week late. Also, once my son spent the time putting the coaster together we realized there was not enough track to finish the project. So, late delivery and missing parts......Will not repeat this mistake again!"
3,Not worth the money.,"I paid $45 for this toy back in 2004 and it was worth what I paid for it them. But now sellers are asking $300 to $400 for this thing and if you pay that much for it you will be SORELY dissapointed! It is nearly impossible for a child to put this toy together without the help of an adult. So be prepared to spend hours on the floor helping out. While we had fun building it and watching the roller coaster several times, it quickly becomes boring once it is built. And it completely loses its attractiveness when you realize you now have a 6 foot long toy taking up an entire room. So unless you're rich, and have a playroom... this may not be the toy for you."
4,One of the most realistic roller coaster replicas.,"I bought this toy on xmas of this year. This toy is fun, but i believe that it is too expensive for a TOY. I just have the right place in my mid sized bedroom. Even though i am not going to buy a different set to construct a differet layout, i still enjoy it. Just looking at it is fun for me. I like to turn it on every once in a while. Oh, it took me about 10 hours to build."
2,Not good.,"This toy will end up in your child's toy box faster than alot of other toys will. The special parts make it difficult to create different combonations for a track. The motored chain to raise the car up to the drop will only pick it up half the time. There can be too many problems with the track itself, too. It takes too long too build it, and when I finished building it i ran a test and said, ""Is that it?"" Believe me, not the ideal toy of its time."
4,FUN,"The Screamin' Serpent Roller coaster is great. Before the compliments, I'll get to the bad stuff.1) It sometimes gets stuck at the top of the hill2) The chain goes really slow3) The cars don't make it all the way down (they stop after the loop) if you don't put furniture polish on the trackI agree with their commercial. It is a real roller coaster, it's just really small. It only takes about 2 weeks to build, and the instuctions are great. This is a great toy for hours of fun!!!"
1,Too difficult,"My boys, age 7 and 9, found this waaaay too difficult to put together. Even dad got frustrated during the hours and hours it took him while the boys evenutally wandered off to do other things. Then it was just way too big to leave it set up anywhere for very long, so we had to take it all apart (left to mom, by herself, as the pieces were too difficult for the kids to get apart and dad had already paid his dues). Of course, it hasn't been touched since. Unless your kids are old enough, I'm thinking about 14, then steer clear would be my recommendation. Sorry to be a party pooper..."
5,Don't Buy It Yet,"I've owned this toy for two years and it hasn't let me down. I built it in four hours without eating or taking a break, and it works like a gem. The motorized chain lift, banked curves, and sound effects box makes this toy seem like a real roller coaster, only smaller. However, I just wanted to let you know that in August 2003, K'NEX is releasing a new roller coaster called the Rippin' Rocket Roller Coaster, with a complete zero degree vertical drop and speed boosters along the track, so if you're interested, save your money!"
2,"Fun to build, boring to play with","My son had great fun building this toy last year during Christmas break. He hasn't touched it since. Once you get it working, it doesn't provide much to do as you just set the roller coaster in motion and watch it. Also, it comes apart easily."
3,"Cool Rooler Coaster, But has SOME bugs","The rollercoaster is pretty cool, but I couldn't get it to fit exacly at the end. The loop-the-loop was pretty cool, but it keeps getting stuck at the top of the lift hill, and at the top of the loop-the-loop. unless you are a techy(a person who loves putting things together and building things) you would like it but I do not recommend it to ones who are not techies. Peace Out"
5,The amazing toy,"The SCREAMIN SERPENT from k-nex is the greatest toy EVER! Iwould encourage you to buy this toy. (...) 5 stars for fun,5 stars on educational value, and 5 stars on durability. YouSHOULD get this toy, and not a momment too soon."
5,Wahoo!,"I got this set at the request of one of my kids at work (we were also considering the other Knex roller coaster). The set is huge! Put all together, we had it on top of a folding cafeteria table that seats 12. The kids and staff had a blast putting it together and everyone, including the parents liked seeing it in action. My only complaint is that because the pieces aren't as colorful as some of the regular sets (big ball factory or trampoline tower), it was a little difficult at time to assemble. And sadly we had to take it apart because it takes up too much space, but we'll have the kids take turns putting it together over the summer. Great set for parents and kids to build together! Our current project is the Trampoline Tower and then the big ball factory!"
5,great Christmas gift for my 8 yr old,"Yes, it took most of Christmas break to get the coaster completely assembled, but it was an excellent project for him and for the whole family. Even though it is now May, it is STILL set up in our family room. The directions are challenging to follow, because many of the colors are not vivid, so it's hard to tell which pieces are which color in the instruction manual. But, we conquered, and he is so proud of it when friends come over to play."
5,COOOOOOL,"This some what hard to build and time consuming product turns out to be one of the coolest things Ive ever seen. Throughout buidling it I thought I messed up about 50 times but it worked perfectly in the end. The sound affects are kind of hard to hear but just seeing it work is amazing. If you have the time to do it and space to put it in, youll have a ball. It is hard to move, and probably impossible to move up or down the stairs. I suggest use a large area in your home, and when you are done, youll love it!!"
4,A Great Toy,"This toy is Great! I had a lot of fun working on it with my daughter. The only problem we had was with the motor. If you dont connect the chain correctly it wouldn't bring the car up. We had much trouble with this part. No one could Figure it out. Finally we did, after many hours of trial and error. But Other than that it is a great toy!!!"
5,The Screamin Serpent Rollor coaster rocks !!!,This toy is amazing and very entertaining. It is just a little complicated by with a little help it looks awsome. One of the best parts about it is that if you dont' like the the way the instructions tell you to build it you can build your own. You can have your own mini millenium force if you choose to in your own house. If I was to rate this out of five I would give it a four and a half. The only little flaw is that the instructions are a little hard to understand.
4,Color in Nature : A Visual and Scientific Exploration,"I am interested in the subject of visual perception, color in nature and in landscape. How human being except nature or landscape (parks, gardens) on psychological level and the possible ways of landscape planning that includes the visual perception."
5,What Made Us Who We Are Today: World War II Oral History,"These stories, told in the words of the people who lived them, spirited me back to a seemingly more innocent and simple time in America. The fact that the stories are in the words of the people who contributed made them all the more readable and enjoyable to me. This would be a wonderful companion book to Tom Brokow's book, ""The Greatest Generation"" because here are their own words."
2,Who needs it?,"""Don't Lie To Me?"" Jeez, where's their version of ""Whole Lotta Shakin Goin' On?"" Buy all of their proper albums. Get someone to make you a CD-R of the two tracks from the Chris Bell 45. Forget this mess."
3,Best if it came with answers!,"because the site doesn't offer a preview, when i ordered this book i thought it was with answers like most of the other reading comprehension workbooks. But it happens to be no answers to all the questions, which is a total let down!"
5,The first episodes of the best TV sci-fi series ever,"""The Way Back"" hooked me on this series and I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Intriguing plot, revealing Blake's motivations and demonstrating the Federation's desires for total domination and their ruthless methods. ""Cygnus Alpha"" establishes the creation of most of Blake's crew and introduces the Liberator. Watch these before you see any other episodes. END"
5,Brilliant!,The beginning of an absolutely wonderful (although underfunded) science fiction series.A must see for any science fiction fan. Now if they would only offer this series on DVD in the USA (Region 1 or 0).
3,A little small,"After receiving this, which was smaller than I had expected, Tuesday Morning had a slightly larger one for $2.99, oh well, that's the way it goes. My grand-daughter had given me her wish list and this site!"
5,"""Adopt a Virtual Pet"".......""and Find Out What This Is All About!""","Greetings to all my friends in the animal world! I am adopted, and obviously happier than a Bamboo shoot. Oops, that's because I am an itsy bitsy panda from Australia. My adoptive parent plans to visit the webkinz website to see if it is secure for all her other friends. Stay tuned.....Earlier in the day, I was rescued from the storage of a major store; it seems that one store employee wanted to know more about my whereabouts. With the help of another store employee, he rescued me from the storeroom, and now I am basking in the comfort of a new family. See you!"
3,gift,this was a gift my child liked it but was not the right size for her collection oh well thats pickie kids
3,not the best,"this product is a lot smaller than i expected, they should definitely include size in the description. overall its very cute but too small."
2,"""Let's not read this one again.""","My 4-year-old loves the Miss Spider's Sunnypatch world, so we were excited to see this brightly colored book about one of my son's favorite things--cars. But the story turned out to be disappointing. My son had zero interest in seeing Miss Spider and Holley shop for a car. He didn't understand the concept, and the words did not help. To him, there was no story, no plot. He was disappointed that none of Miss Spider's kids were in the book, and the illustrations were not clear enough to get him interested in the vehicles. I think we were both expecting a family adventure in a new car. At the end of the book he said, ""Let's not read this one again."""
3,not as good as Miss Spiders Tea Party,"Some of the pictures I found a little sinister (pointy teethed rats and some snarling bugs) although my two year old seemed nonplussed. Very few words indeed, but the pictures are still well done."
2,For the illiterate only!,"Miss Spider's New Car is a sorry attempt at poetry. The rhyming lines have no meter. The pictures, giving a 3-D look to the characters, are quite beautiful, graceful and artsy . The pictures tell the story better than do the words."
3,Very edifying,"The subtitle on this book reads: Do Texas Fossils Indicate Coexistence of Men and Dinosaurs? Unfortunately, this book is poorly organized in my opinion. Also potential purchasers might want to know that much of it is very technical. Nevertheless, there is some very valuable information within its leaves. Not only are there considerable evidences of man and dinosaur coexisting, the authors cite artifact after evidence of a young earth and the recent existence of man in supposedly millions of years old sediments (reality is more like a few thousand years old). There are many interesting color photos including a pre-flood fossilized finger, a pre-flood hammer and much, much more."
4,Great Traveling Companion,"Quite surprised this book hasn't been updated, hence only 4 stars. Some of the shops listed are now out of business and when your destination may be that shop--disappointment to say the least. For that reason I would phone ahead. Other then that, the book is great! It lets you know how many bolts you can expect to find and business hrs. It also features a state map to better assist you in your travel plans. Just wish there was a newer version."
4,EXCELLENT SOFT CORE,"For fans of the soft core genre, this is an excellent contribution. It has beautiful women, highly charged simulated sex scenes, and a decent plot to boot involving a plan to pull off a pseudo kidnapping to get a deceived father to put up a million bucks ro ransom his daughter who is in on the scheme (well played by a sexy young thing who unfortunately does not get a credit listing). In my opinion, Kim Dawson dominates the picture. This luscious blond seems to get better as she matures. Here she plays a very nasty stepmother to a T."
3,OK.,"This DVD was OK. I found the movie to be interesting and the sex scenes weren't too bad. The only reason I purchased this DVD was because I wanted to see more of Kira Reed and her scene in the hot tub with her husband was somewhat pleasing. However, I was disappointed in Kim Dawson's performance as well as Kira Reed's appearances in her scenes. I would've liked to see her in longer sex scenes. But three stars suits this movie."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,Total waste. Nothing good about it. Plot. Acting. Actors. Everything and everybody unattractive. I threw it away.
2,Not worth it.,I don't know what others saw in this but do not waste your time.Nice looking skin but so what? Stories are nver good in the genre but it was middle of road.Buy something else.
4,Very Hot Sex Movie,there is lots of hot women and sex scenes in this movie. The last one with Kim Dawson and Eric i thought was the best. 4 Stars
1,Sex devoid of Style,The women in this movie are certainly not attractive and sexual Scenes depicted does not have that style to impact u
3,this movie is good,kira reed in this movie is okay not as good as some of the other movies she has done
2,Scratch-resistant? It does not seem to be...,"I bought this Feb 12th. I was so delighted with it. I seldom use it, and keep it on the windowsill to charge.I noticed today, though, that I had 3 scratches on the face. I cannot imagine what could have caused that, especially when it is supposed to be scratch resistant. The windowsill is not that cold to ""crack"" glass. The only probable culprit is zipper along the cuff of my winter coat, which I doubt is of material hard enough to penetrate the mineral crystal this watch was supposed to have...I also bought a similar eco-drive for my husband, and it seemed slow, he kept adjusting the time. We are trying to observe how much it gets delayed over time.I will try contacting amazon about this (they are supposed to have automatically registered these purchases for warranty)."
1,Don't buy this scooter,We got this scooter as one of two of the same brand and were very disappointed. Santa left these scooters and assembled them and they looked pretty cool. In the morning when our kids got up and saw them they were very excited! That soon turned to disappointment when the front wheel frll off one of the scooters. The froont wheel is not secured by a screw or bolt to keep it attached. This part of the scooter come pre assembled. Luckily this happened in our living room and not out on a paved surface or while our kids where riding down hill or fast- otherwise they could have been seriously hurt. Do not buy this scooter.
4,Hurricane force winds,"If you likeNear Life Experience, you'll really dig this CD single. While Secret Number is just (not that anything produced by Come deserves to be ""just"" something!) an album cut, the other two tracks are vintage Come.Prize is a midtempo and bluesy song, with Thalia Zedek's smack encrusted growl layered over Spanish influenced guitars, some harmonica, and a restrained rhythm section.The most incredible thing on this disc, however, is the last track. Hurricane II is an acoustic recasting of Hurricane, the lead off track on Near Life Experience. What was formerly a howling, nasty, and destructive song has been transformed into a wistful and desperate, yet equally powerful, tune. Fans of Thalia's later work will recognize the seeds of her current hybrid acoustic/electric sound here.Four stars. Well worth seeking out if you are a fan of Come, Thalia Zedek, or to a lesser extent, Chris Brokaw."
3,Not too many songs on this album!,"Larry is a great musician. He's a very good improvisor and arranger. Too bad he didn't put a lot of songs in this album, only ten. I like to hear music in his own style. I wish he had included Besame Mucho, La Paloma and Quien Sera."
2,Not beauty around here,"When he plays the faster caprices like 5 is tremendous, but when the piece requires perfect intonation and musically, like caprice 3, 11, 4 etc, is horrible.Caprice 3 have ugly octaves, the caprice 2 is in a crazy tempo with bow noise included. All pieces are played agresively, not clean with a constant beat, like etudes.Moto Perpetuo is excellent, because is just speed, nothing else, and speed is the unique talent i see in Ricci's style.Definitively this recording is not pleasant to the ears.But maybe it will ""impact"" some begginers violin pupils, all speed lovers."
3,REFERENCE READ,I purchased this book because I was fascinated by the idea of Online Branding. I think this book is a good reference book but it is dated in a lot of its information. There are timeless principles in the book though that any good marketer would want to get a grasp on. I recommend getting the book used if you really want the most bang for your buck.[...]
3,Interesting but needs to be shortened,"The book began with an exciting detailed account of an A-6 night attack but the book bogged down in the middle with the author's detailed description of everyday happenings on the cruise from San Diego to the Gulf. There's a good book in here if the author edited extraneous details, but it became a chore to finish. Having read three aviation memoirs of the Gulf Wars, I've notice that the ease of writing books by computer has tempted authors to include too much mundane information instead of tightly editing to keep it concise and interesting. To borrow another reviews description of a Gulf War book as an ""information dump"", that phrase applies to this book. If I reread this book, I will skip the boring shipboard incidents and stick to the exciting accounts of combat missions and carrier landings."
3,"schick simplistic design, but noisy and band is fraying.","overall pleased, but wont buy it over again. its noisiness doesnt drive me nuts but i am aware of it sometimes, for example, i have to take it off when trying to sleep. after only about a month i can clearly begin to see wear and tear on the nylon band.."
2,way to small,"it was way to small for a man to wear i didnt like it all, but since the person in my secret santa list order it that way I gave it to him, but if it was for me I would return it"
3,review,"product was not what i wanted, but i recommend the co. for reliability, fast service,it couldnt be beat. i highly recommend this company."
4,Survived the Washing Machine,"OK, it's just a plain watch, tells the time. I've had this watch for a few years now, seems to keep good time, no surprise. But a couple of weeks ago, I must have taken the watch off, put it in the pocket of my pants, and somehow put the pants in the washing machine. The watch came out of the pocket while being washed, and I found it in the bottom of the drum. Still working, there was some condensation under the crystal cover, but just fine otherwise. And clean! I did unscrew the back, removed the battery, and let it sit for three or four days to get rid of the foggy crystal. And working perfectly now. I (and, I'm sure, Timex) do *not* recommend this method of cleaning, but I'm impressed."
3,LOUD!!!!,I love the look etc... but dang it is LOUD!!!!! TICK TICK TICK. my wife wont even let me put it on the night stand. I have to put in on the floor so it's cushioned at night.
5,It keeps on ticking.,"When push comes to shove, there aren't a lot of ways to review a watch.If it's style you're going for, that ends up being a matter of personal taste. Me? I like the simplicity and size of the Camper. I'm pleased that I found a non-leather/non-metal strap watch at a reasonable price - it doesn't pretend to be a ""fashion"" watch, but it gets the job done and works with most outfits I've tried it with so far.If it's functionality you want, it either keeps time or it doesn't. Well, as I discovered after a kayaking mishap, this one keeps time, and is true to its word of being water-resistant. Full marks there. Not even a scratch on the watch face."
3,"Good, but flawed watch","It's hard to complain about a watch that is this cheap, but complain I will.The first and biggest complaint is the strap. I should have put a new one on as soon as I got it, but I decided to keep it. For months, however, the thing kept slipping off. I lost it time and again only to recover it soon thereafter. Finally, I lost it permanently as of a few days ago. I'm so angry because the thing, when it would stay on, was like a part of my body. I was always unconsciously checking the time.The second big complaint is the crystal. It scratches really easily and is difficult to clean. Eventually I gave up and just let whatever junk would obscure the face wear off with time. A harder plastic or a slightly raised bezel would have taken care of this issue.Otherwise, this watch is perfect. Cheap, easy to read, simple, and not 16-hundred grams of stupid, useless gimmicks like so many other watches. It tells time, what else do you want?"
4,"Good watch, but could be more durable","The camper watch is a classic design, and the face size is the perfect for smaller framed men(such as myself). I have been wearing this watch daily for just over 7 months now. While the design and size is perfect, there are some shortcomings in the quality of this piece. Firstly, the included strap is wearing considerably, with the holes for the strap becoming enlarged so that it is no longer a nice and snug fit. It has inadvertently become dislodged from my wrist on a few occasions now. The face of the watch became scratched from fairly insignificant abrasions, and the inside of the watch gets condensation from swimming in water at shallow depths. I am still giving this a 4-star rating based on the function, appearance and price, but really would like for Timex to create a quality piece to this same spec that is much more durable - even if at a higher price-point. At the current rate, I expect this watch to not last me longer than a year worth of daily wear."
3,"Good watch, except...","Watch is good, to spec and as billed. Probably will ""take a licking..."" and last me at least the ten years of the first battery, as advertised, tho the ribbon strap may wear out well before that. Only problem is a lesson in Internet buying: it's LOUD, as in TICK TICK TICK...."
2,Check watch when you receive it.,"I bought this watch for my grandson who is into outdoor activity and boxing. It was one of his birthday gifts. I ordered it early and kept it in a drawer for several weeks. I admit I did not check the watch closely when I received it and tossed the receipt. When I presented it to him, he later discovered the crystal had a flaw that seperated it from the ring on the body. This prevents the watch from being used in water---which makes it worthless for his use. I frankly thought Timex did a better job on quality control...but as I stated, I did not inspect the watch when received. My advise to anyone purchasing this watch is to closely inspect it upon receipt."
1,The tell-tale watch,"I've had this watch for about 6 months.Pros:- Still works- Very light weight- SmallCons:- Cheap strap- Clear (glass/plastic?)scratches easily- LOUDI cannot overstate that last con one bit. This watch is LOUD - like, really really loud.When I am not wearing this watch I usually store in in my sock drawer, so its obnoxious ticking doesn't drive me insane at night.If you ever plan on wearing a watch while hiding in a closet or under a bed from a serial killer - this is not the one for you. The ticking will lead them right to you."
3,Still not sure,"I purchased this watch for a vacation I'm taking to Costa Rica. I wanted something that had a little style, was CHEAP (in case I lose it), and could take a beating. Ideally I wanted a Victorinox but they're not cheap-especially if a three toed sloth ends up eating it off my arm (kidding). I picked this one because J Crew is selling almost the EXACT same watch for $150! Their face is a little larger and metal, but this watch has the same rugged classic look but for $125 less and is still made by Timex. The band is really cheap and where the holes were punched out on the band, scratchy little threads protrude and irritate my wrist. It feels a little plasticy...like I won it from a vending machine. Also the ticking! I'm not kidding, my girlfriend makes me keep it in the other room because it's so loud. If it lasts through my trip, I'd give it another half star. 3 stars are for look and price."
4,Ask me in 6 months,"Don't get me wrong, I love how this watch looks and works, buuuuut ...1. It feels like a 25$ watch; it's very lightweight and probably not very shock resistant. To that end, I'm curious how long it's actually going to last2. The clasp is a little uncomfortable. I'm considering spraying it with plasti-dip to put a coating that'd be a little more comfortable on my inner wrist. I'm hesitant to do this because I don't know how plasti-dip responds to sweat."
2,Too small for a Man's wrist,"This watch is fine if it is for a child's wrist, but it is much too small to fit a man's wrist. I am not the large and need to use the very last hole on the wristband."
1,The only Timex I ever owned that failed.,"This watch kept good time for about a month before it started running slow.It would loose 4 hours in one day.I changed the battery, but that did not help.Timex watches used to run forever. This one was a disappointment."
2,Too small for a men's watch,What I liked:*typography*simplicity of designWhat I didn't like:*too small for a men's watch. The clock face's diameter is just too small. It looks better on my wife.
5,Excellent little watch,"This is the first watch I have bought in a long time, and when it finally gives out, I'll be buying a new one. I'd like to get into watches more, but until then, I'll be rocking this Timex camper."
1,Stopped working after 1.5 weeks,"I gave this watch to my husband as a Christmas gift. At first he really loved the watch. It looks sharp, is comfortable, and it looked like it would put up with years of use and abuse. Unfortunately, it stopped working 1.5 weeks after he took the watch out of the package. We hoped that it stopped working because the battery died, but no such luck. We replaced the battery and the watch still does not work. We are returning it to Amazon."
1,Stylish...NOT well made,"Got this watch cause it was cheap and looks good, so I guess i dont have much to complain about...BUT, i will. wore it for no more than two weeks, went swimming with it on, was totally fogged in and now has water inside the face. It is supposed to be water resistant to like 30 meters or something. Was a waste of $25. Not even sure if worth the headache to try and get refund or new one yet...oh well, cause it is a great simple looking watch."
2,Not the Greatest,"The watch works fine and everything, but there are a few things about the watch that I found annoying:It ticked very loudly.The cloth band never stayed fastened."
5,Perfect Little Watch!,"For what it is, it's a perfect little watch. It is, however, small and designed for smaller wrists. There are other Timex models similar with larger cases."
2,smaller than it looks,"I had this on my wishlist and received it as a gift for Christmas. My first impression was that I had been mistakenly purchased the woman's version of the watch. It's... small. Timex specifies the housing as 34mm wide. That's 1.33 inches.Beyond the size issue, the only other cons for me are that the face picks up scratches easily, and that the ticking is quite pronounced."
3,small,"This is a good watch for telling time! Otherwise it's pretty average. Small face for a man's wrist. I agree it is loud but I didn't have any trouble falling asleep in a room with it, nor did it ever interrupt any conversations. If your looking for a ""fashionable"" military style watch, look somewhere else."
3,Beautiful and simple but very small,"I ordered this watch as a cheap bash-around watch to wear while I was doing things that could hurt my nice watch. I spent a lot of time looking at options and this was a nice looking and simple watch that was cheap and (according to the reviews anyway) tough. I loved it, it was just way, way too small. My nice watch is about 40mm across and this watch was closer to 27-30mm. I ended up buying another timex but the one I liked was the Expedition. It's the same black on black look except this watch is much bigger (about 40mm which is about perfect for me), has a date window and indiglo (which is more of a gimmick but might be useful someday)."
3,eh,"It got the job done.... until it broke. I dropped it once and it broke. Not too rugged for being a ""camper"" watch. ...but then again is is just 20 bucks"
1,something is wrong with this watch,"great lookin watch,feels good,unreliable timekeeper.loses about an hour a day.watch is one month old.will have to send it back to timex.battery change did not help.beautiful watch but unreliable.the worst timex i have ever owned."
1,Not waterproof and LOUD,"I had mine for about 5 months. The only issue I had is this watch is really loud. Audible to people who aren't wearing it. I could live with that, then it stopped working. At first I thought it was the battery and replaced it with a new one. It didn't do anything. I can only assume the watch broke due to water issues, and it's not like I went diving w/ it. I just did dishes and occasionally got it wet in the rain. Anyways it's really a disappointment."
3,men's watch,"Watch arrived quickly and well packed.The time piece is excellent in keeping time and attractive.The band is extremely cheap looking and very scratchy.Timex instructions for set up need to be enlarged as print is hardly readable.All in all, a seems to be a good watch for not very much money."
4,"Simple, small, the right price.","There's nothing fancy about this watch--just a simple design to keep the time. It's light weight, compact, and comfortable. It's smaller than I expected (seems like a women's watch size), which was a nice surprise. It is just what I was looking for (except for it not being waterproof).CONS:NOT waterproof, just water resistant.The loop band that holds the main band in place looks a little cheapWrist band band holes are a little scratchy and can be a little difficult to place the metal pin through it.OTHER NOTE:Like others have mentioned, the ticking is a little loud, but personally, I find it comforting."
2,This is an old model,"This is an old model of this watch It does not have the indiglo feature and an unlisted water resistance. That generaly means the thing is only good to 30 meters. The newer model available at places like Target has the indiglo feasture, water resistant 100 meters for $29.99. More watch for about $3.00 difference if you include shipping.I returned this merchandise and replaced it at a local store."
3,Not too bad,"This watch is okay. The wrist band is pretty flimsy. Also, the 10m waterproof label is somewhat deceiving. My watch broke after 3 weeks because I went swimming with it. READ THE WATER PROOF CHART. I suggest getting this one instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SZNSVA/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 more durable, has a light, has date, better wrist band, and water proof to 50m (meaning I can swim with it)"
5,An honest presentation!,"I recently graduated from a school of Hypnosis; came out basically with one Induction i.e., the P.R. Induction! I thought of adding another Induction to my, ""Tool Box"" (as Mr. Awan puts it) so after searching many sites, I bought this DVD from Acme Hypnosis Center's own site. It was 2 1/2 hrs. long program but I don't think it could have been shorter than that because there were a lot of aspects to be covered and Mr. Awan did that very nicely. His language is easy to follow and you don't miss anything. I've read Dave Elman's book, ""Hypnotherapy"" but there were things I couldn't really understand ( being a novice, ofcourse!) This program explains them in detail. I never wrote to Mr. Awan to thank him for his honest teaching ethics but I think this review should do. Daniel Anderson NY"
4,A fine teacher! An informative video.,"I bought this program in 2004 when it was only on VHS. Keeping in view that it's an educational video, one must not expect Hollywood quality. Malik has done justice to the topic. Yeh, his pace is slow. Overall, it's an honest, informative program. Malik has discussed every aspect of the Induction quite elaborately. I could have given it 5 stars, but I took one away for it's pace and Audio Video quality. I learned from it."
2,Very Basic/Disjointed,"I am just getting involved in hypnosis and bought this DVD hoping that I could get an organized, thoughtful presentation of the subject. Unfortunately, this DVD was not it. The subject matter was presented in a disjointed fashion, was very incomplete, and essentially this was a very amateurish, poorly produced DVD. Mr. Awan was so boring I feel asleep several times during this overly long presentation."
1,got my money back,"I loved the look of this, but I had 2 different models that broke within weeks. After I shipped the 2nd one back to Speck they lost it and just refunded me the cash. A friend of mine had the same problem. Speck stopped producing them because they are great looking but don't last."
1,Don't buy it.,"I bought three of these at the same time when they were $99. The volume knob on two of them went bad after a couple of months. The sound quality is ok. But I get a good bit of distortion at moderate volume levels. They look retro cool, but they are not a good product."
1,Doesn't work with iPod Touches or iPhones,"Great looking, nice sound, nice style ... BUT ... this does not work with modern iPod Touches or iPhones ... this is for very old iPod products. What I can't figure out is why this information is not included in the product description?!? I can see some (not very bright) executive saying, ""Why would we advertise what our products can't do?"" ... for some simple reasons; to avoid irritating customers, costly returns, and bad reviews just like this one ... nobody is going to keep it if it doesn't work, so they are not fooling anyone into keeping it."
2,"Aaahhh, the problems with ordering online","I was really excited to get these boots in. They were ADORABLE! Then I tried them on.... not so good. I have muscular calves and I could not zip them all the way up. I've had this problem before, but after reading about the boots, I thought they would be ok.I was highly impressed on how quickly the boots got to me... however, I sent them back right before Christmas and I am still waiting for my credit on the return. So that too was disappointing."
3,they are good,they are good boots overall ive only worn them a few times but i can said that if you choose to buy them you wont regret it.
5,This book was excellent!,"I thought this book was absolutely excellent! The story was great and it really dealt with some issues that Christians face today in a Christ-like way. It didn't condone practices that go against the Bible, but did discuss how Christians should deal with them. Overall, Alison is an excellent author, and I look forward to seeing more of her work!"
5,SHE KEEPS GETTING BETTER!,"Alison gave us WORLDS COLLIDE - a good read. And now this project which shows how Ms. Strobel is maturing as a writer. A poignant, moving contemporary story that captures relationships and their ups & downs. Highly recommend this fine story and its author. I now anxiously await what else comes from her keyboard!"
2,It contains the one story that I wanted,"I bought the book because it contained ""The Drowned Giant,"" and I greatly enjoyed reading that story again. The other stories were a bit disappointing: dated without creating nostalgia."
4,Bolts don't fit with land cruiser 80,"The damper is superior in quality by itself. But If you intend to use this for a series 80 land cruiser, the damper bolt/post that goes with it won't fit into your steering mounts (it's too big in diameter). You need to buy the bracket kit. Still the bolt that goes with bracket does not fit. You need to look for a replacement bolt. You will see when you buy it. If you want a DIRECT bolt on, buy a TJM or OME."
4,One of the best JJ singles,The title track here is one of the better ones off on and on however the 2 live songs really shine.Its all understood has been given new life with a bit of a bass line and a more reggae feel to it.Flake is very much like the album version with a bit more slide thrown into the verses.Both live songs are awesome and make this a worthwhile single to obtain.
3,"Solid, but...","This is a truly solid case! I would feel comfortable throwing my iPod off the empire state building in this.However, it's a lot bulkier than expected - It does actually measure 1.75in thick x 3.5in wide x 6in long (I thought this was the shipping size with packaging).I'm not sure when I would ever use it. Perhaps in an environment that it gets banged around a lot (like on the boat or ATV, or if you keep your iPod in a tool box...)"
4,The Red Hat Club Rides Again,"Pure Fluff at it's best. A light hearted read of the ladies that formed a friendship back in high school, now in there 50's and members of the Red Hat Club. The ups & downs of life and how they remain loyal to each other through out.If you are looking for a read that doesn't tax the mind, just enjoyable, can make you laugh out loud and cry just a bit, this book is for you"
4,Love the Red Hats - Another Fun Read,"Great book, lots of fun! These are well writen fun books that are a brief departure in the 'chic lit' genre from reading about single girls problems with boys, friends, and jobs. Enjoy!"
5,Great follow up to The Red Hat Club!,I love this book - such a great novel detailing the friendship and bonds of a group of women over the years. I'll be re-reading it!
5,Ever Wonder Where D&D Came From?,If you want to know what shaped the mind of Gary Gygax here it is. From the first story you will recognize the Jack Vance influence. It's strikingly obvious in fact. Right down to the prismatic spray. Not only are his stories original and still fresh after all these years they tend to be better than more current offerings. After first discovering Vance at the tender age of 13 by way of his Lyonesse trilogy I have since scoured the used book stores and library book sales to find those covetted out of print titles. I have never been disappopinted with anything the man has written and that is what amazes me most. Doesn't every author have to have the requisite stinker? One would think so and yet if Jack Vance has one I have yet to find it. Buy it. Read it. Love it.
2,"Great Landscapes...uhmm, that's about it.","A couple of exquisite stories in the original bunch of ""Tales"" (""Mazirian the Magician"" is my favourite) lose their lustre in the subsequent ""novels"" -- actually a poor cobbling together of loosely linked incidents -- in the other three quarters of this collection. Vance has a colourful eye; his vision of an Earth at the end of time is wistful, poignant, strange, memorable. However, when he moves his brush away from composition to the banal mechanics of narrative and character development, Vance loses interest. EYES OF THE OVERWORLD and CUGEL'S SAGA, for example, are basically the same novel lumbered with the same obnoxious hero and EXACTLY the same (slim) premise.A better buy would be a slim volume the ""Tales""; the rest is just paper weight."
2,Sheesh,"I've read over 2000 fantasy titles, and this is indeed one of the worst. I like some of Jack Vance's other works, but not this one. The characters are foolish idiots, with no redeeming qualities, and the world is a mish-mash of loosely interconnected idiocy. Not even a map was provided to allow one to follow along with some of the characters travels. And the prose! The only other author I've ever read that made me cringe this badly with their prose was James Fenimore Cooper, and he gets the benefit of the doubt since he lived in a day when people often tried to impress us with their wordcraft to hide their lack of actual substance.Honestly, I've owned this book for over 14 years. I still have not managed to read it all the way through. I am stubborn though, and will finish it this time, so it can finally go where it belongs, on a shelf collecting dust. Not recommended."
4,A particular taste,"Weirdly enough, this set of books - which make up the set - didn't appeal over-much to me. I found them a little slow paced and ones that meandered along, rather than sought any real conclusion. In most of these tales, the plot is not plain to see, even though you may be deep within it: within this saga, the telling of the story is very much placed ahead of the necessity of a plot, if indeed there is one.However, I love Vance's books and although these tales are ones that I haven't reread as often as others, the humour and comedy held within them, retains the values and relevance of the book; without this I feel, the book would suffer greatly and be remembered as a meandering set of tales telling of a far far far future were technology is so advanced and assimilated within a culture, that it appears as magic."
5,Cugel the marvelous,"I will always remember the first time I read ""Cugel's saga"" (part of this omnibus) several years ago. I was entranced by the dialogue and the way the words flowed smoothly. Jack Vance is a true storyteller. He is descriptive without being too wordy, wise without being too righteous.My favourite part is Bunderwal v/s Cugel in the pub, especially when they choose their champions...Truly a masterpiece. Another part is the village of the ""reclining men"" who must strain ever higher to catch the feeble rays of sunlight. To me this signals the strength and folly of social norms, even in our present day society.I recommend this book. Definitely among the best in any genre."
2,Some of the worst fantasy I've ever read,"I have a very eclectic reading taste, and usually find something to enjoy in pretty much any book I pick up to read. And yet this work was impossible for me to enjoy. And I tried. What others call ""purposely obscure prose"" I call just plain lousy writing.The stories may actually have had some merit were the prose more pleasant...but then, I doubt it, which brings me to the next problem I found with this work. None of the characters were likeable and the world, though others have called it well designed, is just a collection of random whimsy and fancy. The two combined would make the stories difficult to enjoy even if the prose weren't so painful to read.All in all, out of the thousands of fantasy books that I have read, this is the worst of the bunch. It is the ONLY one I had to continually push myself not to toss in the trash without finishing...ever. I found nothing in the entirity of this book worth even a tenth of the time it took to read."
2,Condition not as described,"This book was described as ""Like New"". In fact, both book and dutjacketwould more accurately have been described as VG-/VG-"
1,A terribly bad book,"Maybe just a bad book. The terribly is because some people feel the author is deserving of a Nobel prize and would get it if his name were perhaps Hispanic and he from a different country (check Google for this). This book is (as far as I could stand to read it) a compendium of fantastical and (this is the difficulty) boring adventures. The second tale which finally made nauseous was a sort of reverse Candide where an definitely not innocent encounters all sorts of adventures with not very nice people and manages to out screw them all. Better authors include, J K Rowling, Ann Rice, and Dorris Lessing. The first two will never win Nobel Prize and the author won't even winning a dress.Tales of the Dying Earth"
5,clever and practical,A great twist on an old standard. All the most common drivers in one small package without all the extra filler stuff!
1,"No good , softeare does not wrok with window 7 , and there is not dial tone","No good , softeare does not wrok with window 7 , and there is not dial tone"
5,Line Switching - yes; Call Waiting - no,"Works great, simple to install, easy on budget. Unfortunately doesn't support Call Waiting - once a call is made it is no longer possible to switch between voip and landline. Moreover, during a voip call there is no indication of new landline call - and vice versa.It is possible to work around it by using two separate phones, one for voip and other for landline or a dual line phone. I can only wish that future releases of the device and/or its driver will support call waiting."
4,Works Surprisingly Well,"I was a little worried about the cheaper quality of this device when I ordered, but it works surprisingly well. I'm now using a very cool old-school retro desk phone in place of the stand-alone USB microphone I used to have. Sound and voice quality is great, and I finally have a real phone to dial when I need to call out. Best of all Skype automatically pops open as soon as I pick up the handset; no more fumbling around my virtual desktop. I just hope they keep the firmware up-to-date."
1,Couldn't Get It To Work For VoIP use.,My son is a UI Developer and he remotely tried to get this to work on my computer and I worked on it for 4 days and we couldn't get it to do VoIP calls no matter what we did or added to upgrade the drivers. [[ASIN: B000JCU88S USB Phone Adapter for Skype MSN Yahoo VOIP Interface]]
4,Really not intuitive,"I have to admit, I found the installation instructions very unclear. I installed this on a MAC, so I needed to get the MAC version of the software. Here are the things I had trouble with (and are not particularly covered in the documentation:1. How to switch from Skype to Landline: Pick up the telephone, press the asterisk.2. How to place a Skype call: Pick up the telephone, if USB light is not lit, press asterisk. Then dial:(for a call in the US): 001 {area code} {7-digit number} #Do not use the Skype interface for dialing.Still having trouble entering numbers once the other party answers (like for a conference call, for example). Seem to be on the wrong frequency."
1,Unreliable-two have failed within weeks,"I've lost two of these within weeks of installation, the first after three weeks and the second after two. Symptom is that it stops ringing the phone, then a day later it fails to produce dialtone nor transmit audio to the host PC. I've checked the USB port voltage, no problems. We don't connect the box directly to our house telco line (only to a phone and to the PC), so the trouble is not due to line disturbances (e.g., lightning). I'm switching to another vendor's product, as this one appears to be too fragile a design to survive actual use in the real world. Too bad, as it works nicely at first."
1,NO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!,this item is outdated and will not work with skype 5.0 they send you old software dont wast your time or money!
4,A Good Product hindered by Skype removing speed dial from Skype 4.x,"The product itself I have found to be very good. You should search online to find the newest Skypemate program from the Yealink website. The problem's I had were really caused by Skype removing the Speed dial function from the GUI in version 4.x. The fix for this was installing Skype 3.8 and reinstalling Skype 4.x over it. After that you are still left without a builtin method of adding the speed dial number, but a third party app can be found online that allows you to add the speed dial number to contacts.Skype 3.8.0.188 -- it can be found by searching onlineskypespeeddial(third party app) -- should be the first search result(it's on the authors blog)Once you do these fixes, it's fairly straight forward to set up the Skypemate utility to your liking. I rated this USB Skype Divert so highly because you really shouldn't fault the manufacturer for problems caused by Skype."
4,Simple and it works!,I had to return the d-link dph-50u because it didn't work for me. The installation of this adapter is very simple and quick. Although the software user interface appears to be cheaper than that of d-link but this adapter actually works! I've tried it on both windows XP and Vista. So far so good.
5,usb B2K voip adaptor,I have been using Vosky call center until I got a new computer with Vista..vosky was useless ... so was their support... This product works flawlessly the first time out of the box with Vista.... highly recommend it . Don't bother with others eg D link or Vosky adaptors
1,Stay away!,This product is not supported for windows XP.I was unable to get it to work due to the lack of XP drivers.
2,Works well but not long,"This is a great adapter except the life span is short. The 2nd one that I purchased has just shot craps at 13 months. The first one I purchased, I believe, lasted for 10 months. Bummer."
2,USB Phone adapter,"This product works with Skype but the problem is that if you have several phone, like a 5 phone cordless system, it will ring the other phones while you are taking a call. If someone picks up that call, it will drop your call. If that wasn't an issue, I would likely have rave reviews for this item and sell it to most of our business client, FYI we are an IT Support company. We wanted a simple small business VOIP solution for Skype but this item failed at that, as most have unfortunately. It's said when something that is obvious doesn't work intuitively."
2,Misleading,"This product is listed as ""Connects home phone to network"". This is misleading. It should say, ""Connects home phone to computer"".I wanted a product that connected to the network directly. I can use Skype through my computer if I want, but I wanted something that didn't need my computer. This product isn't it. It plugs directly into your USB on your computer and nothing else.What's the point of this thing if I have to plug it into my computer? I still have to keep my computer up and running all the time if I want a home phone for skype. Therefore, this thing is useless for my needs."
2,Skype Mate,"This device takes control of the speakers, I cannot listen radio from internet when the device is connected. I would like it to work without affecting other programs/devices.I could not use it with VOIPStunt software. It only works with skype (using skypemate software included in the package)"
5,"Excellent product,",Instructions were easy to follow which made the installation process very easy as well. Audio of skype communications was improved after installing the adapter. A public phone line is not required. I have attached a cordless phone to the Eforcity Phone USB Adapter and now it is like having a regular phone line at home. Eforcity's delivery time was excellent. 100% satisfied with this item and with this vendor.
1,Useless,"I just wasted four hours of my life.SkyMate SW is obviously NOT working with Skype properly.1) When I set it up, selected USB port as default, than anytime I pressed Talk button it started sounding Alarm tone. No way to turn it off.2) When tried to dial, some digits were duplicated.3) Went on web trying to find solution, per recommendation upgraded SkyMate to newest version, downgraded Skype to 3.8 which turned out does not work with Win7 64-bit. It does not work with any Skype version for me.4) Apparently does not work without landline connection, which I do not have.5) Misleading information in manual, such as which website has latest driver.Nice idea, but extremely poor execution. Would buy when they fix this, which I doubt (Chinese mfg.)Don't waste your life."
1,this item is worthless to me,"I need to return this item. The problem is that it must be plugged into a phone line as well as the computer USB connection. What is the point? I need something that does not require a phone line. Further, I am disappointed that there were no cables included with this item and no return or other information in the package. Driver was on a disk that does not install. If not for window's ability to detect and install drivers, I would have had to track it down. I cannot tell you how well it works because I cannot install it without the phone line. Overall, very disappointing!"
2,OK but Weak Software,"Unfortunately nearly all hardware needs software to work. In this case the hardware does what it claims but is let down by the quirky software you must use ""skypeMate""."
1,Troublesome for Mac,"I tried using this device for my Intel Core 2 Duo Mac running OS X 10.6.3. I installed the SkyMacMate 1.0.0.12 software (PPC) provided by the manufacturer, which runs under Apple's Rosetta. I plugged in my phone, ran Skype, and got a dial tone. I tried dialing, but couldn't make a connection. Maybe I needed to configure something else, or I didn't dial properly, but I gave up. Other reports I found on the web say that the product doesn't work for Mac OS, as the software inevitably locks up the CPU. When I came back to the computer a few hours later, I found a few kernel processes running out of control, and I had to reboot. Luckily, I found that a Bluetooth headset works seamlessly with Skype, so I went with that. Although I'd prefer to use the better microphone of a handset, it didn't look like I'd get the product to work with my Mac. I might invest instead in a Jawbone headset, which may have the best microphone sound."
2,"It was very,Very tough to get some clear idea or support to make it work from the mnaual or from the internet information.","It is not easy to get CLEAR and EASY set-up instructions to avoid total disappointment of the product's inability to adapt as a transitional device to keep the functions of your normal land-line phones compatible.The settings from one's PC and the settings of the Skype network failed to create a constant compatible expectation for normal use.It either would receive or not receive a call or fail to function incoming or outgoing calls as expected. It worked than stopped working. It probably works but there is no particular set-up plan to bring the devices into a normal telephone network and no skype support that gives credible remedies or solutions. It is a, 'Houston I think WE have a problem' and Houston responds with ......?? It is not a We thing project. You are all alone.Good luck.Thomas USA"
2,Product did not work,This product did not work. Tried many options to get it to work but just wasted a lot of time. I returned it.
1,Louder background static,"I have been using this adapter for several months now. The installation was pretty easy. However, like the user who gave it two stars, I am experiencing background static. Unlike that user, however, this static is loud enough to drown-out the voices on calls. This makes the phone almost useless. The static cannot be heard on the other end of the conversation, just on mine."
2,'Meh' on a Mac,Been using this on a Mac for a about 7 mos. Works about 75% of the time. Mic will randomly mute. Software crashes with restart. Will not work with latest Skype. (Only 2.8 or earlier). I would skip it.
1,Don't waste your money,"If you have money and time to burn this is the unit for you. Directions were terrible, you had to dial a series, yes I mean series of numbers to call out on Skype. Totally worthless.And no I am not the type of person who doesn't like things and writes nasty reviews, trust me, flush your money down a rat hole before buying this worthless piece of junk. I am VERY disappointed Amazon is selling this worthless item.I never could make a call out, I did receive a couple of calls in. HOURS spent and what a waste of a product.Price looks good, now you know why."
1,Not fully functional,Does not function as advertised. Dial from handset does not work. Using tones to access automated help does not work.
1,"awful product, dangerous software","Product does not work with a mac, software causes entire system to crash. Stay away."
3,Good book to travel with,"If you're planning a driving trip and want to do antiquing along the way then this is a neat book. Each state has the major cities with lists of antiques shops (not comprehensive but a start) as well as recommended Bed & Breakfasts or Inns to stay at. The thing that's missing for me is an intro to each state that kind of summs it up - like if you're going to go to the state definitely don't miss going to this area or that area or if you're going to be there a certain time of the year watch out for this antique fair or this flea market. I'm still looking for a book that will do that. So, for me this book only gets three stars but I think if you plan to be going on a trip and are interested in hitting a few antique shops along the way then this will help get you there. It would have been nice if there were short reviews of the different shops indicating what the dealer specializes in if anything. Oh well. This book left me wanting something more."
4,sweet,"I just recently saw this movie and I loved it. It's a sweet romantic comedy, and the cinematography is just beautiful."
5,Shirley MacLaine Fan,"This DVD was great! The story was good! The DVD had great English subtitles! The DVD was sharp, the sound was clear! Shirley MacLaine was Beautiful! Amazon's free shipping was fast! DVD arrived in good shape! What more can you ask for?"
4,great classic,"I have enjoyed this movie over the years whenever I catch on TV, so I finally bought it. It's just one of those you like to pop in on a rainy day and curl up with your cat to watch. The story line is good, the actors are great. I love the transformation in Shirley MacLaine from headstrong actress to selfless Geisha. Movie is nicely done. Basic DVD, no extras, No documentation in the case, just a DVD. I miss the little pamphlets and pictures they used to put in them. Pop some popcorn and ENJOY the movie though!"
1,My Geisha,I have not received my two copies of My Geisha yet please can you let me know what to do. I sent you an E-Mail yesterday but i'm not sure if it went through ok.RegardPauline Evans
1,Buyer beware!,"I've had leakage problems with this unit since purchase. It was difficult to get the various supplied hoses connected to my exterior faucet hook up and to the 100' hose to be attached to it. Everything leaked. In desperation (after I'd tried everything, including plumbers tape)I asked my gardener to check the connections to see if he could get them to stop leaking. He advised that there was nothing he could do - all connection parts were defective (missing threads, crooked threads, threads that were too short). By this time, the return date was long gone. I'm going to be stuck having to buy another unit. It won't be a Suncast product!"
3,It broke.,"I purchased the hose reel because of its features. Used it for two summers. It did everything I wanted it to do. Rolled the hose onto the reel fairly even, held all the hose I need for my yard and has a cup to hold extra attachemnts. The third year I went to use it, the place where it connects to my short hose to the outside faucet broke off. It is virtually useless at this point because I don't see any way the piece that fell out can be fixed/replaced. It is the piece that allows the hose to be connected to the outside faucet and still unroll or roll up the hose on the reel. I feel for the price I paid it should have lasted longer than a couple of years. Do you have any suggestions for fixing this product?"
1,Broke within a couple of weeks,"Broke where the middle part connects to the bottom part with the wheels within 2 weeks. Put it back several times, but eventually wouldn't go back. Will never buy Suncast again. Very poorly made!"
1,"low quality, cheap plastic","The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all."
1,Absolute Junk,I have had three of these over the past 3 or 4 years and all but one have failed miserably. They leak and the Rube Goldberg hose connection on the inlet side of the hose reel invariable breaks off rendering the whole unit useless unless you want to use it to roll up electrical wire or something like that.
1,Waste of my time and money,"There's a fixture where the short green feeder-tube connects to the axel that is held togeather by two tiny clips of plastic about as wide as a paperclip. If these peices get stressed (say by tugging on the hose even a little bit) they break and the feeder hose falls out of the reel.The problem is: It's a fragile part, there is no replacement available, there's no way to repair it, and it's only a matter of time before it fails. And that's unforgivable.Save your $35 and spend it on something else.I won't buy another Suncast product the rest of my life."
2,Design flaw (corrected in new models) causes problem and free replacement parts offered.,"I had my previous Suncast hose reel cart that wintered outdoors in Virginia winters for more than 10 years with no problem - other than eventual old age. Based on that experience, I ordered this item thinking it could not be that bad despite the reviews.The item I received in August was broken by January. After reading some of the posts here, I contacted Suncast. The representative was very gracious in stating there was a design flaw in the intake tube that had been corrected and shipped the new parts to me, so brownie points for their handling of the issue.The rest of the cart seems very sturdy for what you pay. I am cautiously optimistic that this cart will now last the next ten years.If you live in the south, you probably would not have this problem."
2,Great if he could sing on-key,"Dougie has a pleasant voice and writes pretty, heartfelt songs. Unfortunately, on virtually every song I've heard by him, he goes flat on the last note of almost every line. If you have heard only one or two of his songs and are here to sample the rest of his catalog, this is a warning: if listening to someone go flat over and over and over again during an otherwise listenable tune makes you grit your teeth, then stay away from Dougie's live or studio albums. If, on the other hand, you can overlook the occasionally off-key singing, go for it. Natalie Merchant has plenty of fans too that put up with her lazy vocal stylings; Dougie MacLean, as a national treasure of Scotland, deserves to be at least as successful as she is. I just wish they could carry a tune."
5,Perfect for any Doisneau Fan!,"As a huge fan of the Doisneau pictures of couples kissing, this one fits in perfectly. A private moment captured. Perfect for any romantic space. We have it hanging in our bedroom and love the way it looks."
5,Very Smooth,I Had Been Looking For This Cover For Months...Didnt Find It In Any Stores...I Wanted This Cover Specifically Because My Father Had A 92' Town Car With This Cover...And I Was IN LOVE With That Car...Now-a-days I Have A Town Car Of My Own...4 Years Younger But Still The Same Car..And I Had To Get This Cover...Just For The Memories...So I DidI Ordered It Here From Amazon...Chose Two Day Shipping...It Got To Me Exactly When It Said It Would Get To Me...Brand New...Exactly Whats In The Picture...Put It On The Wheel...Took A Bit Since Its Not That Stretchy...But Perfect Fit....I Am Very Satisfied With The Product And The Transaction
2,Not good,This cover has an orange tint wood grain that probably wont match anything. It was a bit stretched out and just strange.
2,STeering Wheel Cover,I must say poor quality. Very disappointed because it did not fit on my sterring wheel. I do not recommend.
1,"ugh, feels sticky all the time","Imagine wrapping your steering wheel in vinyl contact paper. Ya know that sticky feeling? That's how this feels. Yes, it's smooth, but your fingers sort of stick to it because it's such smooth vinyl. And when it's hot, it's even worse. I bought this yesterday, today it was returned, and I'm now shopping for something with a bit of texture to eliminate the sticky feel. Good luck!"
4,Good Resource,Into the twisted mind of der fuhrer. This work provides insight into the irrational thoughts of a mad man as he conducted a war of annhilation. Great resource for the student of World War II.
1,Unnecesary,"This book is one of the many hundreds of books on Hitler in normal bookstores. This book is typical of the obsession, unhealthy, with Hitler. What's next, a book on Hitler's bathroom reading material, a book on Hitler and his garden? Do we really need to know what Hitler rambled over lunch while chewing on some Schnitzel? This book records in mind numbing detail the boredom and stupidity and nuttiness of Hitler while he relaxed with his `boys' and driveled on about the destruction of Europe while musing about how great the German sausage tasted.This book is really just not worth it unless your writing the next in depth biography of Hitler and even then the detail is too much. This book would be fine as a reference stowed away in the catacombs of German studies 1939-45 but its useless as a book to read and find interest in."
1,One star? This recording doesn't deserve any!,"The qualities of Ricci's performance and even the undisputed beauties and complexities of the works recorded here are merely suggested by the awful quality of the sound recording. It is more likely the work of an amateur (one might guess if it has ever been authorized by the artist!), excruciatingly distorted and thoroughly covered by hiss and pops - the clearest parts are the applauses! There isn't anything like balance here. Worse yet, Ricci seems not to be at his best, although making any rendition about his performance is a heroic piece of guessing-what-might-be-happening-now-beyond-those-annoying-noises. A serious candidate to be immediately returned by any customer who dares to buy it despite all my efforts to warn you. So, don't!"
2,Sound-It-Out Speller,"Found the book very hard to understand and use, especially for someone who is learning disabled."
5,Outstanding Mix of Music !,"There are forty songs on this album, they span a huge range of music from Andy Williams to Leftfield. Where else could you find the likes of Moby, Fat Boy Slim, Propellerheads, Prodigy and Faithless back to back?The music flows from one track to the other, and it is easy to see that alot of thought went into the selection.My own favorites were ""Shallow grave"" Leftfield and the suprising ""Boom Boom Ba"" by Matisse......All in all if you buy one album this year, this one should be it!"
5,No Choice,"You simply have no choice. When a record has so many great artists, from Moby, to Dean Martin, to the Pixies, to Isaac Hayes you HAVE to get this C.D."
3,Useful ... but ...,"I found this atlast quite useful and a good resource, but in places it is too discriptive of what I was looking for, and in other places not nearly complete enough. There is too much continental European material for my liking, and too little Irish and Scottish material. I wish there had been more. Still, it is a useful text."
3,The Next Time You're In the Celtic World of Yore . . .,"Now if King Arthur had had the Atlas of the Celtic World, he would've been well remembered today. Oh sure, you can get a map or chart to just about anywhere today, but can you get one to the past? How about the early Middle Ages? How about the Celtic World, of which so little is known about? John Haywood has done just that, providing you with maps so clear and precise that you could navigate your way through the green hills of Wales today. Accompanied by an in-depth history lesson for each map, and fill details on the many little-known cultures of this type, Atlas of the Celtic World takes you on a journey that I am sure you've never taken before.Originally published on April 1st 2002.For over five hundred more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter [...]"
1,Aaaaaak!,"It's very fitting that this movie took place on a train because the ensuing wreck was foretold. However, the movie does serve to prove Mr. Waltz's point made ininterviews after his ascendancy in Inglourious Basterds, the gold has to be in the script before it glitters on the screen. It wasn't, it didn't."
2,Not worth the money!,I purchased this product while in school. Many of the questions were wrong and the point pictures were not in the actual place. It was so bad that many students at my school had to return it. I tried to return the product to the creator and he wanted me to go through the hundreds of questions to find out which one were incorrect. I even verified the question through the book he wrote and the required MSOM text. The 1st (CD)software that I purchased would not even download to my computer. I had to be sent the info via e-mail from the company for the initial download. For almost $200 and many incorrect answers this software was not worth it.I wasted alot of money and time on this product and was not effective in passing or studying for the boards. I would check out other test prep software. I took the BIOMED and none of the questions were on the boards or close to it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,inapropriate front cover,The inappropriate front page illustration would probably stop most people from looking further into the contents of the book.
2,Welcome to Gabby's ego-trip,"""People are already pissed off at me because I'm athetic AND beautiful; to be smart in addition to that...it's like, too much."" And that quote sums up this book in a nutshell: the breathtakingly beautiful Reece telling us how hard she works and how smart she is. Interspersed througout is co-author Karen Karbo clucking in agreement (for example, detailing a Nike PR session where Gabby makes snappy insults at questioners). For the first half of the book its unabashed unhumbleness is refreshing, but by the end you ask yourself if the world really needs any more athletes/supermodels/intellectuals with ""attitude.&quot"
5,Awesome Santana Compilation,This is probably the best available Santana compilation. It features many classics (live and studio) as well as many great unrealeased Santana live and studio tracks.
5,"an unusual, yet compelling collection","I'm truly suprised to find so few reviews of this collection. It's a strange brew of hits (some studio, some live) and unreleased cuts; yet somehow it all gels very well and, in my opinion, provides the best overview of Santana's (the band) work. It's finds it way to my stereo far more frequently than Santana, Abraxus or Santana 3. And that surprises even me."
5,STRONG,this is a Must Have Santana Set Too Have.The Music here Really Captures The Essence of The Santana Genius&Legacy.The Tones&VIbes here are Strong.Very Essential.
4,double live CD rocks!,"This is mostly live, with some previously Unreleased Studio Tracks.However, the sound quality of this album is worse than on the newerre-mastered releases.2-disc spans 20 years of Santana up to 1988. Some live tracksappear on other releases as well."
1,Abbreviated to say the least,"The problem with this soundtrack is the same with others I've purchased: You don't get all the songs on the soundtrack that you heard on the movie. There were at least two songs I heard on the movie that I bought this soundtrack for. There aren't on it. What a waste. The song playing while the bikers were in the bar and pulled a gun on the waitress was great and also wasn't on the CD. Since I didn't know the name of the song or the artist I couldn't know whether it was on the soundtrack or not. Now this soundtrack sets on the shelf. I will eventually sell it, if I can find anyone willing to pay good money for this joke of a soundtrack."
