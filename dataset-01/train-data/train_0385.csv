3,"It's okay, but...","I own the Grind and Brew in Black. It has some nice features, makes a decent cup of coffee and appears to be well constructed. However, I did not realize what a pain to clean the machine is after each use. Steam gets into the grinder during brewing which leaves a soggy residue in the grinding chamber. It is not like the dry residue I have using an ordinary grinder that I can easy brush out and wipe with a damp cloth. Therefore, I have to break down and clean the grinder everytime I use it. It cleans up okay in the dishwasher, but it is a hastle to do by hand with all the nooks and cranies."
1,Junk,"I loved my grind and brew until quit working. It worked flawlessly for almost 9 months, then it would only brew 2 cups of coffee at a time, and finally none.I replaced it with a $10 coffee maker from Wal-Mart. It doesn't grind the beans but it makes coffee just as well was my dead $130 Cuisinart."
3,Fine for the first year or so...now dangerous,"After the first year or so, the door now constantly pops open while brewing, allowing scalding hot coffee to flow all over the counter. This should be recalled as a hazard.I will have to replace it now."
1,worst coffee maker ever,"Cheap and complicated plastic used inside a 100 plus maker. Coffee overflowed 3 times in a span of one month. Turned out a check valve in the carafe lid sticks, causing the coffee to overflow. Lid design is such that impossible to clean the valve area. Forcefully removed the valve cover and removed the valve. The valve cover, required to open the valve in the ground coffee basket above, is now reattached with duct tape. Looks like hell. And of course the coffee cools down faster. Stopped using the grinder because it takes at least 1/2 hour to clean the grinder area, even using a tooth brush. Water level is very difficullt to see. By far the worst appliance I ever purchased. Will not purchase another Cuisinart product."
5,"Excellent product, delivered as advertised",We're enjoying our fresh ground coffes in the morning and the machine works great. The product was delivered as advertised.
2,A pain in the brew,"I concur with the others who said that...too much hassel to clean, the steam up in the grinder cup, the coffee grounds in every nook and cranny, take it apart, clean it, put it back together, enjoy coffee, take it apart, clean it, put it back together, blah, blah, blah. My wife hates it. If you are looking for ease, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an above average cup o' joe, look here. But make sure you know that you're buying a high maintenence machine."
1,One of the worst designed products I have owned,"This is one of the worst designed products I have ever owned. In theory, it is great to have a grider and coffee maker all in one product. However in practice, the design makes it a pain to make coffee. Each time, you need to clean the filter and the lid on top of the filter, the two pieces that make up the grinder as well as the coffee pot. You also need to dry the two pieces that make up the grinder. Otherwise, the coffee grounds get stuck in the grinder and the channel that leads to the filter, eventually blocking the entire channel. I am about to go back to my good old coffee grinder and my old coffee machine."
2,Coffee pot,The pot was to heavy and I like the glass better. I passed it on too my grandson and he loves it.
3,the jury is out,I do not like this coffee maker real well. I do get it out when I have company. It is more to clean than my bunn. It also leaves a taste in the coffee that no one notices but me :-( I also never received the rebate that I sent for.
5,"A must have if you want it all (set ahead, grind, keep warm)","I'm on my 2nd grind and brew and can't imagine using anything else (the first one got blown out by a power surge in a storm). Yes, it has a lot of parts, but if you want it all, there will be parts! I appreciate being able to set up my morning pot the night before. It's my alarm clock. There is nothing better than coffee made from freshly ground beans. Make sure you get the thermal carafe. It's 3 pm and I'm just finishing the last cup made at 9 am this morning. Not piping hot, but not cooked to death or cold! The only problem I've ever had with this machine (in 8 years) is that the grounds can get into the drawer gizmo and unless you clean it very carefully, you could have the drawer pop open unexpectedly. Now that I'm aware of it, I always double check to make sure it's properly hinged. The only improvement I would suggest is to include a spare set of parts, so you can swap out while one set is in the dishwasher."
1,Really not a good product,"I bought this on Amazon in August 2008. It just failed completely, with the electronics working in random sequence - on, off, program, grinder, off, grinder, off, etc. etc. Now I cannot brew coffee because I cannot shut off the grinder, and the brewer will not start until the grinder shuts off. I thought the grinder would be a nice feature, but the grind is very course, and the noise will wake you from sleep.... a gimmick.In my opinion, a product costing this amount of money, should last longer than 18 months or so. And, oh yes, the cover on the carafe leaks - permanently - unfix-able - count on it."
2,Some design flaws.,"I have a similar machine, Cuisinart DGB-600BCC. The good: it makes pretty good coffee, though I'd prefer a cone filter. It's nice to wake up to the sound of coffee being ground. I used a metal filter and it worked better with this machine than with others I have owned.The bad: This is a design flaw that may have been fixed in other models, but check before you buy. The steam from the brewing coffee goes up into the grinding chamber, making a tough mud of the remaining coffee dust.This requires regular washing. Also, the door holding the basket tends to pop open on its own, creating a shower of grounds or coffee on your counter and inside the machine. I am only using it now as an temporary grinder to make coffee in a french press."
2,Terrible - even haunted machine!,"Received this coffeemaker as a wedding gift. Decent but not great grinder [very loud; incomplete grind]. Hard to clean as condensation collects into grinder. After a couple of years, some of the buttons and lights stop working [can't change time, grinder off, etc]. Carafe leaks when pouring. Now, 3.5 years old, it will spontaneously start grinding - at random times. The water reservoir lid will be open, no water in the machine - but it will start grinding. I can now only use to make a quick brew, then unplug to prevent random grinding attack [sounds like an air raid siren]. I have really soured on Cuisinart products. Beware"
2,got this for christmas two thumbs down,NoisyLid is almost impossible to take off without rubber lid removerCannot see how much coffee is in potNOT very hotHard to cleanMessy when making coffeeI had better results with my 10$ walmart coffee pot..paid over 100 at macy's for this one.I would think twice about spending that kind of money on this coffee maker..it really isn't worth the money!
2,Does what it says but....,"The grinder/maker works but it didn't live up to my expectations. If your're lazy and love great coffee, this is not the machine for you. First of all there are two design flaws. A) it is too tall, it will not fit under most 18 inch cabinets; B) you cannot brew two consecutive pots as the grinder is housed with a unsecure lid within the percolator. This causes the grinder to accumulate all the steam from brewing, thus leaving the grinder completely saturated. Anyone who grinds thier own coffee, knows a wet grinder is not a good thing. As a result of this, you have two extra parts to clean in addition to the standard coffee basket and pot. Lastly, the grinder is wickedly loud."
2,You're better off with a separate grinder,"A lot of moisture gets in the grinder, requiring that it be cleaned after each use. I finally stopped using it and bought a separate grinder. Also, when pouring for a long time, such as in a travel thermos, the coffee will drip around the pour spout and land on your table. I wish I never purchased this machine. I suppose the coffee stays hot for a respectable duration, but that doesn't outweigh the other problems. The only thing it really does well is look good."
3,Fairly decent unit,Makes great coffee. It has two problems: one is that it has overflowed while in use and coffee and coffee grounds were all over. (Water amount was correct); the second complaint is that the carafe pours very slowly and is difficult to pour to empty.
1,"Poor design, mediocre coffee","- It is programmable, but since you have to warm up the carafe with hot water each morning, that's useless.- If you don't warm up the thermal carafe, you get lukewarm coffee (remember there's no heating pad in the machine).- It brews good coffee, if you put in pre-ground coffee, but I didn't buy it for that.- The grinder is poor. Clogs up and even if it's full of beans for just 8 cups of coffee, the coffee is weak.- A lot of cleaning required if you use the grinder.I bought in haste trusting the brand and now I'll go back to the simpler cheaper model."
5,Grind and Brew Cuisinart,I love this machine! Grinds (quietly) and brews then shuts itself off becasue the carafe is a thermos! They are a genius! Hot coffee to take anywhere you want.
2,captainjohn,"In my quest for the perfect cup of coffee, I am very disappointed with this unit. First, the coffee is warm, not hot. The thermal carafe is a joke. Coffee needs to be warmed in the microwave for 30 seconds. Second, the filter basket is so small, that if you like robust coffee, you can only make 4-5 cups at a time. No way can you brew 10 cups unless you like weak coffee. My $15 Toast Master makes better coffee. I'm returning the unit."
1,A NIGHTMARE OF A COFFEE POT,"I purchased this pot to replace a Melitta Grind and Brew with Thermal Carafe that is no longer manufactured. It is difficult to use - hard to clean, has a tendancy for the coffee grounds to overflow and clog the carafe opening causing coffee to spill all over the counter, etc. Recently the mill stopped grinding altogether and I thought I'd keep it anyway and just grind the beans separately but after the third overflow in two weeks we are chucking this baby out!"
2,Don't make a full pot of coffee!,"I'm very disappointed in this coffee maker. It loves to overflow if you make a full pot of coffee--what a mess! I tried contacting Cuisinart about this issue, but no one will get back with me."
3,Needs a lot of beans,Initial experience was disappointing - coffee was weak with the recommended amount of beans. Finally made good coffee using 1 1/2 scoops of beans per cup.
2,Grind function limiting for strong coffee drinkers,"I give this machine 2 stars b/c I don't use the grind function, which quite honestly is why I paid over $100 for a coffee machine. The grind function only holds enough for maybe.....5 or 6 cups of coffee MAX, and even then, it grinds it so fine that 20% of it sticks to the sides and the rest is for brewing, which makes WEAK COFFEE (not to mention the noise wakes up the neighborhood, it's a little intense).However, I'm salvaging it - I grind my beans in a separate grinder, and I can turn off the grind function, and brew it this way, and it tastes GREAT. The thermal carafe is good b/c it does stay hot, but pours so slowly you always think you're out of coffee - pretty weird.In sum, if you like strong coffee, get a Cuisinart without the brewing function and save some money."
3,"Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew, Brushed Chrome Coffee Maker",Coffee Maker works well except for 3 dumb annoyances:a.) The grinder spins too long even if it is set at 4 cups capacity. Grinder spins beyond 15 seconds after all the coffee grind has emptied into the drip holder. Did the manufacturer ever tested their own machine?b.) There is no light indicating if the keep warm feature is still on or not.c.) Carafe's cover lets the coffee pour out so slowly that my grass grows faster than filling a cup of coffee.
5,"Great All-in-One Coffee Grinder, Brewer and Storer","We had a Cuisinart combo grider, brewer and storer for some six years prior to purchasing this new one. The weak point in the system is the basket that holds the ground beans or pre-ground coffee. The drawer system on the old unit broke and would not stay closed, thus making the whole system useless. Cuisinart should work on strengthing the drawer mechanisms so that this does not happen. The new unit is identical to the old one (NOTE: Everything else on this system is wonderful and thus justified buying a second identical one) so we are entirely pleased with the new unit. We'll just have to be more careful with that fragile drawer!"
1,Avoid this product,"If you want something that looks good in your kitchen, then buy it. I owned it for about a year and a half, it's in a closet and I got my old cofee maker from 13 years ago and I am so happy. The grinder was the first thing to go and then the entire coffee maker just quit working. For what I paid, I expected much more."
2,Coffee pot review,"Was a huge pain to have to clean it every day, every part, and it ended up breaking after a year. For the cost, it is better to have something else."
2,Not so Great,"This item is overpriced for the quality, I had problems with overflow and leaking long before a product of this price should have, do not waste you money."
4,Happy Enough,"I also almost did not buy this based on certain reviews. So far, I am glad I did. It meets my criteria - I want to wake up to the smell of brewed coffee, and did not want to pre grind or buy ground coffee. It is kind of fussy to clean, but really, it only takes me a minute, literally. I love the coffee it makes and so does my family. It is only six months old so I cannot vouch for its longevity yet, but I hope it continues to perform."
1,Was great when it worked,"We had this coffee maker for under two months when it started to malfunction. After searching online I found that there is a known problem with only a partial pot brewing. Pushing the ""1-4 Cups"" button results in an entire pot brewing.A $100 coffee maker that doesn't function properly after two months was disappointing. What was horrendously frustrating was the customer service Cuisinart provided. They charged me shipping for the replacement and to send back the defective unit. A few months into owning the new unit and the same problem is starting to crop up.Today I checked the status of my mail-in rebate and it was rejected. Straw, meet my broken back. I will never purchase another Cuisinart product even if they come out with a coffee maker that performs sexual favors."
3,It leaks,I have had four of these machines and after about a year they all started leaking coffee onto the kitchen counter during brewing. Don't know why but for whatever reason they do. The only reason I keep buying them is I like to have freshly ground coffee brewed and ready when the alarm clock goes off.
2,Needs Improvement,"I've been using this product for almost a year now. I'm not very happy with it for the following reasons:1. Coffee is not hot enough, so I always have to warm up the pot with hot water which defeats the purpose of having it automatically make coffee.2. Grinder plastic parts are cracking3. Potential for huge mess: Life is hectic in my house, and occasionally, I forget to put the basket in the maker. There are just too many parts to assemble and although this is my fault, the machine should not allow me to turn it on if there's a missing part. It's happened about three times since I have it, and this morning was the last.4. The grinder is a bit too small to make a full pot.I'm not going to get into the positives as they have been reviewed ad nauseum."
1,"Sadly, All the negative reviews are true","We purchased this coffee maker less than a year ago. It has failed. The digital clock fogged up and the buttons stopped working. Despite occasional huge messes and excessive daily maintenance, it did make great coffee, just consider it diposable."
1,Terrible coffee maker!,"I am very dissatisfied with this coffee maker. It makes lousy coffee. To get the strength typical in other coffee makers, substantially more coffee is required. The grinder doesn't grind enough, so I am now grinding my own beans and putting them in the coffee maker. There are many parts that need to be taken out and cleaned after each use, which makes the whole process tedious and time-consuming. Because of the way various parts pop up and swing out, I'm waiting for something to break. The thermo caraffe needs to be heated with hot water, so using the timer for morning coffee produces less than desirable temperature retention. I would not recommend this product unless you like weak coffee and have lots of time to spend setting everything up. This is a real disappointment from Cuisinart."
1,WORST POT OF COFFEE I HAVE EVER MADE,I make good strong coffee that I drink black. I have always ground my own beans. This coffeemaker makes the styrofoam cup at the gas stations look good. VERY BITTER. Extremely disappointed. This product is going back to the store today. Not worth even one star.
1,DO NOT BUY this procduct -- not up to the Cuisinart rep,Do not buy this product. I bought one and it stopped grinding after about 2 months. Got a second one -- same thing happened --2 months of service and it stopped grinding.Even while it BRIEFLY worked it was mediocre. The container to hold beans was not large enough to hold beans for 12 cups of anything but very weak coffee. It is also VERY messy.I have since bought a Krups maker and a DeLonghi burr grinder. This is a much better combination.
1,The grand award for bad design,"The grinder does not do a complete job. The steam from the coffeemaker comes up into the grinder, making a nasty mess each time you use it. The spring loaded basket unlatches on its own and allows coffee to dump everywhere.One of the worst appliances I've ever had. Back to my old Krups."
1,worst design ever invented,"The engineers that designed this one obviously drink tea!!The grinder is worthless and wastes lots of coffee. Then it gets all of condensation heat so you have a gooey mess.The worst part is the all plastic door. It seems that when it gets hot the latch loosens up, door pops open and water goes everywhere. This problem happens at least 10% of time.Do not waste money on this junk!"
1,Pretty piece of junk,"This thing is a nightmare. I've had it for two years but didn't use it till a year ago when my 10 year old faithful Bunn finally died. First off, it's grinder is so loud you wouldn't need an alarm clock to wake you in the morning. It doesn't grind all the beans so your final cup of coffee is a bit weak. If you don't scrub and check the basket every time you use it, it clogs up and leaks all over the counter. The door for the basket pops open for no reason at all and it leaks. When you pour water in the tank, it leaks. The carafe is not made for pouring and it leaks. Get the picture? It leaks from all over the place. It is programmed to stay on for 2 hours but turns itself off whenever it feels like it. Sometimes it doesn't even turn on or you go to get a cup of coffee and its turned off half way thru the process. It's going in the garbage."
1,BACK TO BASICS,"I was really looking forward to not having to grind a bunch of beans and store them for use in my current Cusinart paper filter coffeemaker. Now, I have to get beans out twice a day (I drink coffee in the morning and at night) and have to clean the top grinder unit and clean out the filter unit before each use. This coffeemaker is very irritating. The carafe hold 50 oz. of coffee which isn't that much if you use a typical 8 oz. coffee cup. The carafe needs to be tilted at a much steeper angle, which in itself isn't a problem. But, it is almost impossible to get all of the coffee out of the carafe. So I really don't even get the full 50 oz. I am almost ready to change to become a tea drinker! If this unit cost maybe $40 the irritations would be acceptable, but for $120-$130 I consider it a rip off. I would like to see Cusinart recall this coffeemaker and refund everyones money! I'm going back to my paper filer, ground coffee only, coffeemaker."
2,Good coffee! For about 3 months!!!,"Easy to use, a pain in the neck to clean, but I was willing to forgive when I smelled the coffee in the morning. However, after about 3 months, the basket catch mechanism stopped working and I was waking to a huge mess of water, coffee, and grinds all over my counter, cabinets and floor. Ugh! I contacted Cuisinart, they advised me to pack up my machine and send it to them with 10$, and they would fix or replace my machine. They sent me a brand new one! I was so excited! For about 3 months! Then the nightmare continued with the basket mechanism.Alas, I have dug out my old reliable Mr. Coffee and am grinding my own beans while I save up $200 for the Capresso..."
5,Excellent Coffee System,"This coffee maker is the new rave of the neighborhood. the coffee is as tasty as the corner coffee shop (when you use fresh beans). The reviews where this device was badmouthed because it leaked all over the place were probably written by some very lazy people. I wouldn't brew a pot of coffee without cleaning this or any maker, so their ""leaky"" conclusions are unfounded. I would (and have) recommend this gem to anyone."
1,Frustrated,"I've had this machine for over a year. Great tasting coffee but a pain to maintain. It's extremely slow in making the coffee, taking sometimes over an hour to make one pot of coffee. Cleaning with vinegar doesn't help speed up the process. Now I've quit using the machine because the water runs out of the bottom just about as fast as I pour it in."
1,"Too many parts, too much cleaning required",I don't like it. There are too many parts that must be cleaned after each use or it'll plug up with grounds. The water level inicators are inside and difficult to see. The grinder is a blade type that is noisy and gives a poor unadjustable grind. Coffee brewed with this is marginal at best - nowhere near as good as my old Krups. Too expensive. My wife's taking it back to the store right now. Bad coffe pot. Bad.
1,Beware,I cannot stand this coffee maker. The cleanup is very involved. Some areas that need daily cleaning are completely inaccessable . Using pre ground coffee it seems to not allow the coffee enough time to go thru the filter . This results in the grinds and hot water pooling till overflow then spilling internally over many fused plastic parts. You cannot even clean them because they cannot be removed. And yes this muck drips over the caraffe and onto the burner and starts to burn. Unbelieveable. Even though you may not use the grinder you still have to break it down and clean the condensate out of it . Very poor. This product is junk. If you dont believe me buy one and see for yourself.
2,Not the Best,We've had the machine for 3yrs now. We have abandoned the coffee gind feature because of the cleanup required each time. The drawer pops out 1/4 of the time which left unattended (morning shower) results in overflow of grinds and coffee all over the counter. The pour is slow and my wife seems to spill every morning. I would not buy again.
2,Already dead,"Well, had this for little over a year and it's already broken. Won't boil water any more. Piece of junk!"
1,Waste of money - sorry cuisinart :(,"Word of advice - NEVER NEVER get rid of your old faithful coffee machine until you've really tested out the new one......This model sadly just does not measure up the price and aesthetic look of the machine - The grinder is so loud it's like a wake up alarm for the whole house - the grinder is not easy to clean - for a thermal pot the coffee doesnt stay THAT warm., and when you do pour the coffee its painstakingly slow and no matter how careful you are it makes a mess everywhere....shame as cuisinart are normally very good - if you dont mind grinding your coffee at the supermarket then do that and stick with the previous cuisinart model."
1,Not up to Cuisinart standards,This lightweight grinder clogs up and doesn't perform to the standards of Cuisinart. Too bad they cheapened their image with this low-quality product. Available much cheaper at warehouse clubs if you really are determined to support this ailing product.
2,Looks Good but...,"This product looks great and makes good coffee. However, it's very cumbersome & difficult to use. In addition to some of the comments in other reviews, mainly the frustration of not knowing how much coffee is left in the pot, it is almost equally as hard to determine how much water is being poured into the machine in order to make coffee (there is no labeling on the outside). When we initially purchased this machine we found it annoying having to lean over the top of the machine to see the labeling for pouring in water (number of cups), now the numbers have worn off completely so it's become a guessing game. It also is difficult to pour water into the machine from the craft without spilling it all over. My husband and I both regret purchasing this product."
4,"High maintenance, but makes great coffee","There are several steps to using this coffeemaker, and several more to clean it after use. It is a lengthy ritual, which I guess I dont't mind, for the sake of having really good coffee. Some parts of the Cuisinart have a ""flimsy"" feel to them, but careful use an cleaning will probably make the appliance last."
4,great fresh coffee,"The grinder is noisy but the coffee is great. Cleaning is easy, but do not put any parts in dishwasher even though manufactuer says it is safe. After serveral cleanings, if not done properly the button tends to stick. The grinder aND BOTTOM PART NEED TO BE WIPE OUT AFTER EVERY USE. In Calif. the company gives a 3 year warrenty and you can return the product to where it was purchased. I myself had had promblems with the side button and grinder after a period of time. I do take care of my coffer pot. I love the coffee but this product has not held up beyond the warrenty. I did purchase this product as a gift for my daughter because of the flavor of the coffee. I have also had one for several years but have had to return them because of malfuction. This is an inconvienced but the flavor of the coffee and thermal pot are well worth the effort. I do feel the company could desing a coffee pot of this cost better."
1,Expensive piece of junk,"Do not buy this coffee pot. We owned it less than a year when the coffee grinder stopped working, and that's not the worst of it. About every 3rd brew cycle, something goes wrong and it spews coffee all over the counter. I hate this pot and can't wait to get rid of it!"
1,Not worth the money at all !!!,"I could have gotten less hassle with a $40 coffee pot. This thing is a pain to clean. After you grind the coffee the moisture rises and goes into the grinder so the grinds that are left get wet and stick to the inside of the grinder. It also drips from the bottom of the pot when you pour due to excess steam after brewing. the water drips down behind the pot onto the hotplate. also the coffee starts to cool down after about an hour in the ""thermal carafe"" We paid $135 for this. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. Run from this product."
2,this item leaks!,"I bought this coffee pot because it looks great! Cuisinart has a reputable name, too, and with the built in grinder, I thought I had it made! But like others have said, it is a pain to clean. But beyond that- the carafe leaks EVERYTIME we pour a cup of coffee. No matter what we do. And from time to time, the filter gets clogged up with coffee grounds, and it does result in spilled coffee everywhere. I lost 10 cups of coffee all on my counters and in my cupboard- of course, when company was over. Not a mess I wanted to deal with. Save your money and do not buy this leaky, hard to clean coffee maker. You will only be looking for a better model in time."
3,good coffee it stays hot for a long time...but is loud & messy,I have had this for over a year with no problems. The cofee is good. But it does have an annoyingly loud sound while grinding. No one could sleep through it It could take the place of your alarm clock! It brews quickly! It is a bit of work to clean all the parts out! But if you want a programmable grind & brew machice I would recommend!
4,cuisnart coffe grind and brew review,"Unit was returned as it was not the one I had wanted, It was the 600 and I wanted the 900, Amazon was really good about taking it back and I did get the 900. Be careful when ordering this coffee maker, the 600 and 900 looks alike when ordering."
5,"Not only recommend, I buy as a gift!","I've had this coffee maker for 5 years; convinced many people to buy; and just bought one for my Mom. The coffee it makes is worth the time it takes to clean the parts; 1-step ""whole bean-to-grind-to-brew"" is genius; and the thermal carafe (pre-heat with hot tap water before start) is better than any burnt coffee from a heating element. Buy it! and at this price - buy one for a friend!"
4,Excellent coffee but there are drawbacks,"This purchase was to upgrade from a previous grind and brew Cuisinart that I had for many years. The new one is sturdier and looks better. The thermal carafe is good and bad. It holds the temperature well for short periods, but tends to loose the heat over time. The pour is extremely slow, but okay once you get used to it. Filling the chamber with water from the carafe is sloppy. Unless you pour very slowly, water runs down the side of the carafe and all over the counter. Overall it is a good coffee maker, but there are some drawbacks."
2,Would not buy it again,"I purchased this little number about three months ago, and in that amount of time on maybe twelve early mornings I have shuffled with half closed eyes to grab my conveniently prepared morning jolt only to find A MESS IN MY KITCHEN BECAUSE THE *^&(%^&( BASKET POPS OUT!!!!! Even when I am cautious to insure that the little handle on the basket faces forward, as the manufacturer suggests, still the basket inexplicably pops out and leaves grounds all over the carafe, burner plate, counter, floor, etc."
3,It can be improved!,"When I bought this cofee, I thought it was one of the best coffee machines I have tried.The coffee is very good. I brought it for the office and everyone was very pleased with the morning's coffee.I realized the cleaning is not easy. You have to really wash it perfectly every time the coffee is finished. If the cleaning is not perfect it will be a mess when the coffee beans are grinded. I can live with this, so is not like the worst thing.The bad thing with this machine is the steam! It goes into the electronic part of the machines, so I guess evething inside gets wet. I was going to throw away the machine just when a friend helped me opening the electronic little box and dried it. After drying the electronic part the machine worked again.Now we put a seal on that little part, so the steam does not get inside.It definitely needs to be improved on that issue."
1,Poorly Made. DO NOT BUY!,"This was a wedding gift from our registry. Even as a gift, we have to replace it. The grind mechanism is ridiculously loud. You cannot use it with guests because of this. Now the worst part. The carafe was poorly designed. You have to poor at an odd angle to only have the coffee dribble out. And it WILL poor all over your counter. I've seen the new versions of this model with a newly designed carafe but I'm not giving it a chance. Worthless. This coffee maker has turned me against Cuisinart and their poor R&D."
1,makes 1950s coffee even from great beans,"Anyone who grinds beans is going to want good coffee. This turns very good beans into something generic from a can. After one pot from this machine, we went out and bought a Capresso, the only combination with an adequate grinder even if it is a bit klugy."
2,"Love the concept, but not well made","Bought one of the original models of these machines around 7 years ago and it worked really well under heavy use for about five years and then the grinder stopped working. Considering it had been used every day, I thought it had actually performed pretty well so I replaced it with the above model. This looks nicer, but is cheaply made and I have had a real problem with it leaking everywhere now that it is about 18 months old, although the grinder still works! It is another example of a great concept being very poorly executed."
3,Grinder Hassle,"I like the pot. I makes great coffee and the thermal caraffe keeps the coffee hot but the grinder is so much of a hassle that I have stopped using it. It is easier for me to just grind my coffee in my stand alone grinder and put the grounds in the pot than to grind them in this pot and then clean it afterwards. They really need to seperate the grinder from the water compartment so that you don't have the condensation problem. For this reason, I would recommed buying a coffee pot that doesn't have the grinder but similar features and probably a lot cheaper. Who has time to clean a grinder after every use and who wants to?"
3,Grind & Brew Cusinart,I have the black version. It was great for the first three months and then it became almost impossible to remove the grinder to clean it! It gets stuck in place so tight that I had to use plyers to get it out and clean it up so that I could send it back to the company for a new one! Hope this one works better.
1,Used it two weeks and it's going back!,"what an awful coffeemaker. The coffee is fine.Keeps hot only if you fill the carafe with very hot water before you brew.Lots of little, clumsy parts to clean-- every time you brew.Too much work for a cup of coffee. Will try to find another Capresso grind/brew. Manufacturer has discontinued making, just as our original one died - after 10 years of faithful use. But there's got to be one left over somewhere!"
1,Very Dissapointed!!!,"I waited along time to buy this coffee maker...after it finally went on sale I went and made the plunge and bought it. I was so excited when I finally got it, but boy...was I wrong. It is very complicated to get it programed. It was very unclear...also there are too many parts to it and too hard to clean. The most dissapointing part was the thermal caraf. It took at least about 30 seconds for a full cup to be poured...it was so slow. There is no adjustment to the lid. What a waste of time and money. I wish I had read all the reviews before I bought it."
2,Too expensive to keep replacing,This is my second grind & brew to own and I love them while they work. They make great coffee and I don't even mind the hassle involved in cleaning them. What I do mind is that both machines have died due to the same problem ... they will not stay on. No one should have to turn on the coffee maker 5 or more times just to get a half pot of coffee brewed. The bottom line ... this machine is too expensive to replace every 2 years.
1,Mess all over,"We purchased our Grind & Brew about 1.5 years ago. It worked fine for about 8 months then for some unknown reason the filter compartment started to pop out of place during the cycle. This has created a mess all over the counter many times, coffee, grounds, hot water. When putting the filter in we double and triple check to be sure it is secure but again, in the morning, grounds and coffee all over the counter and running down the cabinets. We are no longer going to use this coffee maker and am disappointed that we paid this much for a coffee maker and only got a year and a half use out of it."
1,Keeps Shorting Out,"We are now on our third Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew. The product worked great for about 6 weeks then it began to stop brewing after only 1-2 cups of water had passed over the grinds. We would have to continously restrart the unit only to have the brewing process quit time and time again. Cuisinart customer service (which had us on hold for 45 minutes) said that they had not heard of this problem, but I was surprised to see that another reviewer on this web site had the same problem. We sent the unit back twice at Cuisinart's expense only to receive another coffeemaker that experienced the same problem. Don't waste your time or money with this one."
1,Don't even THINK about buying this piece of junk!,"If your idea of a good time is to spend an hour cleaning coffee grounds out of EVERYTHING after every pot is brewed, go ahead and buy this little beauty. On the other hand, if you like coffee that doesn't contain 6 parts grounds to every cup of drinkable coffee, a coffee maker that doesn't have to be completely disassembled, steam cleaned, and reassembled with each use, a coffee maker that doesn't sound like a jet has just landed in the kitchen ... well, then, my friend ... keep looking. This machine deserves a class action suit. But, since that takes too much time, I just threw mine in the trash --- don't even bother to recycle."
1,Waste of money!!!,"Please take my advice and buy another coffee maker! Made excellent coffee...at the beginning. Within a couple of months, we started spending many mornings wiping up the entire pot of coffee that brewed and dispensed onto the counter. Then, the grinder started randomly starting itself and not shutting off. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!"
2,very poor design,This thing is a major pain. The carafe leaks all over. The filter basket door won't stay closed. The coffee bean holder and the water tank are too close together. You spill beans no telling where stuff goes. I'm retiring it after three months of trial and going back to Capresso.
2,Needs Improvement,The thermal carafe dose a wonderful job of keeping the coffee hot. When brewing pre ground coffee I dislike that you must turn off the grind feature before turning on the unit every time you want to make coffee. I also dislike the angle required to pour the coffee.
1,Disaster the most labor intensive coffeemaker out there,"If you have the time to clean every part of this coffeemaker everyday, then this is the coffeemaker for you. You have to clean the grinder, grinder blades and the intricate top to the grinder after every, I mean, every use. Only for people with a lot of time on their hands and like to get them wet.This is the biggest rip-off out there. I am not the only person that feels this way-two other people in my neighborhood threw theirs out as well. The trashmen must have a treasure trove of Cuisinart Grind and Brews, God knows they don't have time to clean them after every use either."
2,A nightmare to clean,"Buy this coffeemaker and you may find yourself going to Starbuck's just to avoid cleaning it. Every time you make a pot of coffee, you must disassemble, clean, and replace 7 different parts. Poorly designed and engineered."
1,Not what I expected for this price,"I liked the idea of grinding just-in-time and in the same unit, to cut down on the steps and time required to get coffee setup at night, and the mess it creates.I found it takes longer and makes more mess rather than less.The unit has some basic design flaws. The grinder is right above the filter, and every time you use the unit, steam from the brewing process gets into the grinder making a mess out of the grinder compartment that is a lot of work to clean.I use about as much water for brewing as for cleaning the unit. Also, there's about 2 tbsp of coffee grounds that get stuck in various part of the grinder which don't get used in the brewing. That's a lot of waste of perfectly good coffee.And having a flat round filter rather than a cone filter, I found the coffee doesn't taste as round and strong as what I'm used to from my old Krups machine.If it wouldn't be such a pain, I'd take it back."
1,Bad Coffee + Big Mess,"I bought this as a present for my wife, who liked the idea of putting beans in the resevoir, setting the timer and waking up to a delicious cup of coffee. Unfortunately, the grinder works, but it does not allow you to set fineness to your taste. Steam rises from the brewing area and moistens the grinding part, so you have to clean a bunch of soggy coffee grounds out of the top of the maker every night in addition to cleaning the filter and the carafe. Worst, the filter basket is prone to popping out on its own in the middle of the brewing process, sending coffee streaming down the counter and onto the floor. Finally, the carafe leaks."
1,Stressful!,"Well, I opened the front door, threw the entire coffeemaker out the door and watched it smash all over the front sidewalk!!!!! IT felt great too! I have had this since September. Since then the grind drawer has popped open no less than four times during brewing and flooded the counter. You cannot use this machine unless all SIX annoying pieces are in place. Hard to see how much water you have poured and this past weekend I did not have the carafe lid on tight and the entire pot of hot coffee spilled all over the counter, floor, and new rug. Out the door it went! I hated this thing from day one. Don't know what I'll do if a bigger appliance breaks?"
1,Nearly great; but a great failure instead,"I have owned and used this item for about five years now. As noted elsewhere here, when this product works well it produces great coffee with admirable qualities. I love the gold filter, the thermos, and the programmable grind and brew. But come on! About 1 in 30 brews results in a coffee catastrophe, where maybe half the coffee ends up in the thermos and the rest goes everywhere else you don't want it to be. To make it more irksome, I have been unable to find any trigger for this horror. This morning, I had fully cleaned the unit, dropped the kids off to school, and I returned to spend 30 minutes cleaning drawers that were full of coffee plus the cupboards and the floor. Today was the last time. It's in the trash can and I'm shopping for a new machine with no regrets. And yes, cleaning the unit was a pain but normally the chore was worth it."
2,"Great Idea, Bad Product","I thought this machine would be fantastic. Put in beans, set timer, go to bed, and wake up to a fresh pot of coffee. The first pot of coffee was great! Every pot after that required thorough cleaning of the grinder. Cuisenart needs to improve the design of the machine so the steam does not seap into the grinder area. I thought I'd let it sit and dry and it would be ready to go the next morning, but that never happened. I ended up returning the machine and buying a Krups (which I love)."
2,"Good idea, but doesn't work well in practice","We ended up returning this one. It was a pain to clean, but the biggest problem is that we couldn't get a good cup of coffee out of the darn thing. We called customer support and they said that certain beans will not work well with the non-adjustable grinder that is built into the machine. Per their advise, we ordered some Dunkin Doughnuts beans and this helped a bit, but there was still a pronounced bitter after-taste to the coffee. We could tolerate the high price and cleaning hastle if the end result was great. But since it wasn't, we chose a different model."
1,Worse waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought it would be so cool not to be cleaning my grinds up everyday. Boy was I wrong, This is the worse mess, to clean-upI dream of my Mr. Coffee. I spent so much on it I can't get rid of it yet. Do Not Buy"
2,Needs More Engineering,"Product is well built, but its primary feature -- integral coffee grinder -- fails to do the job. While most of the coffee ends up in the filter basket, the average grain size is 5 to 20 times larger than that of coffee ground in a separate grinder. Consequently about 33% more coffee is needed to achieve a desired strength and, even with this this much extra coffee, the flavor is substantially inferior. I've stopped using the internal grinder, but the apparatus needs to be installed each time, even to brew pre-ground coffee. Set-up and clean-up are thus more complicated than with other, less expensive products."
4,DECENT COFFEE MAKER,"I think the coffee comes out tasting really good and it is HOT. The biggest downfall is you have to clean it every single time thoroughly. It does steam up so if you pre-make your coffee the night before you have to dry the machine in additiont to cleaning. The programming works great, but the sensor for the carafe not so great. If you forget to put it out, the coffee still brews and all over your counter"
1,Twice wronged!!,"I received this coffee pot for a birthday gift and thought it would solve all of my very early morning wishes- fresh, hot coffee the minute I rolled out of bed! Well, after cleaning the myriad of pieces and parts, I found that I had to use twice as many beans as normal, since most of the grounds stayed in the basket. I adjusted - small inconvenience.After 6 months it just stopped brewing, grinder worked but nothing else. I returned it for a new one. Four months later, same thing. I eMailed the company and no response. I give up - no more cuisinart products for me!"
1,"Messy, Noisy","Returned coffee maker after 5 months. We tried to like this machine but it was a messy nightmare. Noisy- when grinder starts wakes you up, scared the cats. Messy - need to clean grinder basket all the time...if you don't...water disaster. If you forget to put coffee basket catcher in...no alarm...lots of water. If you forget to put the lid on the carafe... no alarm...lot more water. The machine will alarm if you don't close the top lid or forget to put the grinder basket in...neither cause a water disaster. Good coffee...think you can find other machine that offer tasty coffee for not the expensive $$$$$$$$$$$."
3,Great concept,"We've had this coffee maker for about two years and love it for the most part. I love the fact that the beans get ground right before brewing and that it's programmable. I also love the stainless steel carafe because of the heat retention, but don't like that it's not see-through. It would also be nice to have a see-through section on the water reservoir to know how much water you're pouring in, without having to lean over the top.About a year ago we began having problems with the base of the grinder. It wouldn't come out on its own and had to be pried out with a pair of needle-nosed pliers. This made it extremely difficult to clean and I was only cleaning the base every couple of weeks (mostly when the wet grounds would clog the chute leading to the filter). We've finally had enough of the prying and are looking for another machine."
4,My 2nd Cuisinart coffee machine,Just purchased my second Cuisinart Grind and Brew and I simply love this one the best. Love that the latch is better made. My old machine would pop out from the vibration of the grinder and I would have coffee brewing all over the counter. Love the stainless steel carafe and the automatic shut off. Makes a great cup of coffee with very little clean up.
1,"Brilliant idea, horrible engineering","Awful to keep clean, noisy, coffee filter door occassionally pops open brewing coffee all over the floor. After having this product for two years, the grinder sticks and it's difficult to remove it to clean it. Grinder must be taken apart daily and cleaned because the grinder builds up steam and is always wet. Doesn't like pre-ground coffee, it clogs everything. Worst coffee maker I ever had. I am going back to having a separate grinder."
2,Worked for two years ... then ....,"My wife and I hammer our coffee makers pretty hard. After two years of every-day-use, a water leak started to show at the top, right (where the grounds are kept). According to online blogs and reviews, this happens often. Cannot fix it.This (coupled with the fact that the grinder always gets damp ... different issue), renders us buying a new one. Sad, because we really liked it.I just looked at Cuisinart's website ... this item has been discontinued. Do NOT buy."
2,"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me","I first purchased this coffee maker 5 years ago and was very excited about all the features such as the built in grinder, permenant filter and thermo carafe. It worked great for a while and then all of a sudden it only brewed 1/2 cup of coffee, even when there was water left to be filtered. At the time, my husband and I lived in a place where there was extremely hard water, therefore, we thought it must be the hard water that caused it to break, so we set out to buy a new one since we loved it so much. Not even 1.5 years later and now living in another house with normal water, the 2nd one is doing the same thing- only brewing 1/2 pot! For the price we paid, I was hoping to get many years out of this coffee maker. It looks great, has amazing features, but all that is short lived. I am hesitant on even buying the brand again."
4,Very good product,Overall I love this coffee maker. If you use the little scooper it comes with and measure exactly it makes awesome coffee. Better than Dunkin Donuts. The only reason I didn't give it 4 starts is because my mom bought a cuisinart coffee maker with a thermal carafe that doesn't have the grind feature. Her coffee stays scalding hot all day long even after you pour a cup. This coffee maker does not keep coffe hot for very long. I'm a stay at home mom and I drink cups of coffee through out the day so I end up having to nuk my coffee. But that is my only complaint with it.
1,High Maintenance Pain in my Morning,"Steer clear, I can't imagine a more poorly designed coffee maker.The product review states ""When the aroma of freshly brewed coffee... wafts into your bedroom in the morning, you won't need your alarm clock."" The truth? 1) The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, so there is NO satisfying coffee aroma and 2) you won't need an alarm clock because the grinder sounds and feels like a jet rocket - VAAAAAH-ROOOOOM!The machine is also very high maintenance. There are too many parts to clean and it's cumbersome to disassemble, reassemble, disassemble, reassemble, etc. Furthermore, these parts are messy - grounds scatter all about and frequently end up in the carafe itself.There is also no option to circumvent the hideous grinder by starting with your own grounds.The only nice thing I have to say about this product is the fact we got it as a gift (Thanks, Mom!) that said, I can't wait to replace it!"
2,Looks great but too much work for a cup of coffee,"This is a cool looking machine and works great. It's a lot easier to grind your coffee in something else that doesn't get all wet with steam,etc. though. And the unit is too tall to fit under some counters and still be able to open the top lid to put in the beans and pour in the water. You need a good 24 inches to get this done. The daily clean up ruined me in less than a week. I sold mine used and one week old on eBay."
3,good but messy,"Most days I am happy with my Cuisinart all in one grinder brewer coffee machine. It grinds right there in the machine and you don't have to transfer from a separate grinding machine into the coffee machine. That is very convenient and saves the mess of spilling coffee grounds all over the place while you are desperate for your first cup of coffee. UNfortunately, the mesh filter inside the grinding chamber gets clogged up with coffee grounds, and you basically have to clean it or at least wipe it every time. So the convenience of self-grinding is nearly canceled out by the inconvenience of all the cleaning, which is also very messy. When I bought this there were few others like it on the market. Now there are many others which are a bit better and I think I will upgrade to a different brand next time."
1,Don't waste your money,"I love a good cup of freshly ground ""strong"" coffee. If you like strong coffee, this is not the coffee maker for you. It only hold enough bearns to make 3 cups (6 ounce cups). If you attempt to make more than 3 cups, you best be prepared to get out the tools to take it apart to clean. The coffee grinds goes everywhere except where you can easily clean it up.I currently have this in a box in my garage. It will stay there."
3,No battery,"My only complaint about the Cuisinart Grind and Brew is that it doesn't have a battery, so unlike my $5 clock radio, you have to reprogram it every time the power goes out."
5,I love it!,This machine looks great and brews great tasting coffee. It's easy to clean. I've purchased Cuisinart before. Their customer service folks have always been helpful too. Give it a try.
3,"Good coffee, but with some comprimises","This coffee maker grinds and brews great coffee, but has some limitations (comprimises).The unit is tall, and won't fit under our cabinets (1960's house).For best use, most components must be rinsed to remove underground beans (a few each time) and ground coffee sticking due to condensation.The carafe is heavy and awkward to pour from, but does keep coffee hot.So, not perfect, but we've decided to keep it after finding a spot on our limited counter space for the unit. We love our coffee, and so nice to have fresh ground for every cup."
1,Cuisine Art Grind and Brew,"This product has been a nightmare from day one. We have experienced many problems with it. Not too long after owning it, it began to shut off before it finished brewing the coffee; we had to continually restart it to get it to brew the full pot. Now, the clock shuts off the minute it finishes a pot. So we have to unplug it and replug it in to brew anymore coffee.We have been taking good care of the maker. We clean it quite regularly, and all these problems have occurred in less than a year. This is something I would expect from a thirty-dollar maker, but it's unfortunate to have wasted all this money. Even without the mechanical problems, it is a hassle to make coffee with this product. Now, instead of just grinding in a regular grinder and pouring into a french press, we must clean the grinder, clean the filter, dry the grinder with a paper towel before we can begin to brew coffee. Gets to be a little annoying every morning."
1,A Disappointment,"We have had this coffeemaker for over a year and have been truly disappointed. We have finally decided to replace it with a different one. Here are our main complaints:- The grind feature is SO loud - wakes up everyone on the house each time it's on- It's a total pain to clean - the little coffee grounds get everywhere in the machine, requiring you to clean just about after every use- The hardware is flimsy. Already the swing out filter holder/cup area sticks and you have to shove it in - it no longer pops out when you press the button on the side.- The coffee is weak! I might forgive the first couple complaints if at least the coffee was good, but we've found that it's WAY too weak for our tasteI would not recommend or buy this model again. Sorry, but it gets a one bean rating from me."
1,Huge Hassle,"Although I love the concept of this coffeemaker, it doesn't live up to my expectations. Fresh ground coffee certainly tastes best, but the Cuisinart Grind and Brew doesn't last. I am now on my second unit. The first stopped working after about a year. As I didn't save the receipt, the ""limited 3 year warranty"" did me no good. And, Cuisinart refused to help.So, I bought a second one. This unit died after 4 months. No, I'm not immersing it in water or doing anything odd to it. It's just not made well. Yes, I saved the receipt. However, says ""to facilitate the speed and accuracy of your return, please also enclose $10 for shipping and handling of the product"". Huh? They made a bad coffeemaker and they want me to pay for both shipping to AND from Cuisinart? This really rubs me the wrong way. So much so, in fact, that I will probably never buy another Cuisinart product."
2,Beware,"This has been an inconsistent and frustrating machine for me. It's extremely delicate - get one little thing wrong and you get a terrible cup of coffee. The grounds can get stuck in the grinding section and it's almost impossible to pull it out to clean it. All in all, a terrible experience. Much preferred my late, lamented Melitta, but they don't make it any more. eBay, here I come!"
2,Not so good,"The coffee maker itself is fine, and I like that it brews into a thermal pot so the coffee doesn't burn. But the grinder being in the machine is just a horrible design -- what were they thinking?With the grinder in the machine, it gets wet, and any grinds that remain in the grinder stick to it, so after each use, you have to pull the grinder out, and the shoot where the grinds go through, and wash them both. It's a real pain in the neck.Cuisinart must have realized this after brewing their first pot of coffee in the test lab, but I guess at that point it was too late to do anything but sell it. How aggravating."
1,Lots of problems --,"The first one I owned worked alright for almost a year. (Was disappointed because it did not automatically grind set # of cups like my prior Capresso. Also it is a big headache to clean.) In about a year, it started spilling coffee out all over the counter -- I bought a new one on sale and have had it an aggravating 3 months --just mailed it back after the same coffee spilling out problem. This model seems to be very popular -This popularily won't last as people find out they do not last and are very aggravating to maintain. Capresso is far superior but does not make stainless steel with the grinder............."
3,"Does the job, but not easily","This coffee maker does indeed grind and brew, but has too many parts for my liking. Takes a bit too long to set up and clean. The carafe does not stay warm long enough, requiring the pouring and nuking of coffee. Still, not a bad value for the money."
1,"We can put a man on the moon, but can't make a decent cup of coffee??","I have unfortunately owned FOUR of your Grind and Brew coffeemakers--three of which, I purchased myself, and a fourth given to me by my father. This is the WORST COFFEEMAKER I have EVER OWNED. It clogs and floods my kitchen on a daily basis. Today, I brewed a full pot of coffee, and only got one mug out of the pot, and the remainder is currently on my kitchen counter and floor. The flooding coffee is damaging my counter tops and my kitchen floors. It is not a defect in my current grind and brew, rather it is a defect in the entire product line. I have TRIED to love your coffee makers. Like I said, I bought THREE of them. I am amazed that a company that generally produces such quality products is unable to produce a coffee maker that doesn't flood my kitchen every day."
5,Fabulous,We LOVE this coffee maker. Introduced to us by our son-in-law at his house. We had to come home and order us one. We mix Espresso beans with decaf beans and it is such a treat every morning. After 7 weeks costing us only 7 cents a cup for fabulous coffee.
1,Not Worth the Money,"I have had trouble with this coffeemaker from the beginning. It is hard to clean, and I have a daily struggle to get the coffee grinder part loose from the machine. The latest malfunction is that it brews only part of the water. I have to push the on button three times to brew all of the water through the coffee to make a full pot. I spent so much money on it I wish it was worth it, and now I am shopping for another machine."
2,Lot of trouble,"I have had the DGB-600BC for 4 weeks. I use the grind and brew feature as an alarm clock because it is so loud. But that is not my main concern. I am not that pleased with the coffee (I use a high quality bean). Another concern is the cleaning process. It takes at least 5 minutes to clean it after each use. You need to use a brush and soap then you will not be able to get all the grounds out. One good feature is that you can put the parts in the upper rack of your dishwasher, but I do not run my dishwasher every day. I have gotten better flavor from a cheap Black & Decker BrewMaster. The coffee does stay hot, but I do not believe it stays hot for 8 hours as some claim. I usually drink it within 30 minutes and it is beginning to cool down."
3,"Good brew, but several pains","This coffee maker has good and bad:Good1. I love coming to work and having the coffee ready (timer),2. The carafe pours fine (I disagree with other reviewers),3. The built-in grinder is great for fresh tasting coffeeBad1. The carafe does not keep the coffee hot as long as other thermal carafes (which is the primary reason I only gave three stars),2. The built-in bean grinder is cool, but is a pain to clean each time,3. The grinder sounds like a jet taking off (although I do like it when it freaks out my office mates when it goes off in the morning)."
1,Wear hearing protection.,"Overall I hate this coffee maker but my biggest complaint is how loud the grinder is. It was so unexpectedly loud, I actually jumped back when the grinder came on. Also the lid is very difficult to move from lock to unlock and vice versa. Also difficult to take off lid for cleaning purposes. Both of these things are enough to make me want to return it ASAP! You are forced to clean the bean grinder every time because moisture gets in there. The coffee was hot and not too bad tasting, I'll give it that. After I return this, I'll probably get the Cuisinart coffee maker without the grinding feature."
1,Follow up review,"This is a follow up review from a year ago. Basically, this machine is a lot of work. There have been at least a half a dozen times when I've forgotten the lid or made some other minor mistake that resulted in coffee pouring out all over the counter. I also agree with other reviews about the carafe. I always pour my coffee over the sink; otherwise, there's always a spill. If you want to be able to have coffee without any work at an instant's notice, get a super automatic espresso machine. I just got a Capresso C1000. It makes coffee and dumps the residual grounds into a reservoir. No cleaning. No programmimg. Just get up in the morning and press a button. Yes, it's expensive, but if you want great coffee and convience, there's no beating a super automatic espresso machine."
3,Flavor-free coffee,"I like a strong cup of coffee in the morning so when my last coffee maker wore out I purchased the Cuisinart. The thought of fresh ground coffee in the morning sounded great. The timer and grinder worked fine, but the coffee is always weak. What a disappointment! I just ordered a new coffee maker from Amazon."
1,How in the world is this rated so high?,"It felt so good to toss this at the transfer center today. What a piece of junk. To start with when it did work the coffee was very weak. It just can't hold enough beans to brew strong coffee. And the clean up was such a pain. even if you didn't use the grinder you have to have it in to brew. so even that has to be cleaned every time. Now for the dark side. The basket pops open ether when grinding or brewing. This means you would have to babysit it while brewing. Timer brew? Piffff And if you read around you will find its known for this! At the end I found jamming the basket with a plastic fork kept it closed. But then it just died, It would do nothing but beep at me. So after only 4 months it was junk. And I bought it referbed so it was past its 60 day. I'm going back to KitchenAid,,,,,I never should have left"
2,Does not stay hot,"We were given this machine and had heard rave reviews. The coffee never stays hot and the flavor is not good, no matter if you use the $$$ coffee beans or the cheap ones. The clean up is a pain. The condensation gets in the grinder so it cakes and gets wet and wastes beans. The programing is easy and the noise is loud, but not as big of an issue compared to the pot getting cold after a few hours. We have tried brewing with filtered water and using the charcoal filters, with no charcoal filter and only filtered water and no matter what the coffee just isn't that good. Now we are searching for a new machine...need good flavor and it to stay hot."
5,Best Coffeemaker EVER,"I have heard/read a lot of coffeemaker reviews, I even wrote 1 or 2, but this machine deserves/earns my best coffeemaker EVER award. I really could care less about what others think of it. I have owned a LOT of coffeemakers over the years from a Mr Coffee to the King Krupps, this one is the best I have ever owned, used, or seen. Mine has last 3 years without a hiccup or whimper. Makes coffee as good as you can expect dependant on the quality of coffee you use.BEST Features: Steel thermal jug, substantial, unbreakable, easy to clean, highly utilitarian, attractive. Good to great build quality. In an era when nothing lasts for very long, this one will last. Uses the most common/inexpensive paper filters available when you don't care to use/clean the copper one. Programable.Cons: More complex than it needs to be. Relatively expensive branded/exclusive charcoal filters. Interior condensation (easy to deal with once you're used to the machine)"
3,Great Coffee......but why does it leak?,I love the grind and brew feature but can't figure out why it leaks coffee from under the front plate. Does anyone else have this problem?
3,Too much work!,"It is a disappointing machine.1. Water capacity too low and hard to see the fill lines when pouring water into well.2. Recommended amount of scoops of coffee beans too much! I made my first pot of coffee and almost choked on the strength! I finally experimented and got it down to 5 - 6 scoops, and then the coffee tasted great.3. I agree that the pot pours too slowly. It takes forever to pour a full cup of coffee.4. Cleaning also is a hassle.5. Carafe does not keep coffe hot most of the day.I wish I had read more reviews before I bought."
2,Disappointing and Overpriced,"1. Too much hassle to clean the grinder...literally a 10 minute process just to ""reset"" the whole thing to make coffee.2. Carafe pours so slowly you'd swear it was waiting for you to deposit money first.Skip this thing...It's a hassle."
4,"Yes, it does work but the manual doesn't tell all!","We had the older model which finally died completely but we liked it well enough to buy the new one---if you compare the instructions between the two you will find that the ""program"" paragraph of the new model fails to tell you about the ""green light!"" Make sure it's on after you enter the time or you will wait quite a while for coffee!"
3,Great concept & Not a bad cup of coffee,"I've had the coffee maker for 3 weeks and am getting accustomed to the ""high maintenance"" nature of this appliance. It does make a great cup of coffee using good beans, but it does not make much. Four mugs and it's gone...so make another pot you say... Well that's where the high maintenance comes in. Prior to firing it up again, one must wash and dry the grinder which gets steamed in the brewing process. If not dried well, the next batch of freshly ground beans will stick to the sides and top and not drain into the basket for optimum brewing. Directions recommend allowing it to ""dry overnight"" One other downer is that the carafe does not pour well. We have tried different angles but always end up with coffee on the counter. Our old reliable coffee maker is still sitting on the counter. We have not decided which one to put away."
1,Eeeewwww...,"This product, which I think is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned, has been returned. It had some good reviews here - did these folks EVER use the product?Each session of use requires you to do about a 20 minute cleaning session, since the steam makes a grimy, sludgy mess in the grinder, and throughout the interal parts of the unit.Grounds slip past the included filter, and into the pot. Its really tall, so it was hard to even get the coffee and water into the machine for my 5' tall wife. The top wouldn't open while unit was under the cupboards on the counter - it opens UP and so must me moved everytime you want to do anything with it.Shame on Cuisinart for allowing a product this poor to make it through testing.Amazing that such a good compnay could makes such a lousy product."
1,AWFUL PRODUCT,"There are too many faults with this proudct to list them all. I will stick with the highlights1. No measurement markings in the carafe. If you can not put this pot by the sink, dont buy it.2. Awful product to clean - Seven parts to clean per brew!3. Pooring rate is painfully slow4. Makes a weak cup of coffee with minimal water and a full grinder of beans.I am still looking for the right coffee pot but this product is an engineering/design disaster. If zero stars was an option I would do it."
1,Did someone say tea?,"Thats what the coffee looks like after it brews!After many days searching for a coffeemaker I stumbled upon this one at Williams Sonoma, paid more there by the way. Well it""s going back to them tomorrow.PRO's, there really is none except if you are looking for something pretty to sit on your countertop for decoratation.CONS, many . This brews the weakest coffee I have ever had. I even resorted to rebrewing the pot it made and still no taste,The coffee comes out a light yellowbrown see-thru color, not dark and rich.The water level is a bit hard to read.Coffee does NOT stay hot for more then 10 minutes,Does not seal shut, had steam coming out in places it never ever should .Clock is impossible to readReady beep, well lets say don't wander more then 5 feet away to hear it!LOTS & LOTS of coffee grinds ended up in my cup , disgustingThis model should have been pulled from shelfs a year ago."
1,Do not buy!!,"This is the worst coffee maker. The BIGGEST problem, is coffee going ALL OVER your counter. This can happen 3 ways... either it over flows from the carafe because there is a block in the lid, or because it is not sitting in the machine correctly. OR because the door pops open that holds the ground beans. I came online just to write this review after having to clean up an entire counter and floor of coffee 3 times this past week. The only good thing to say is that it can grind your beans and brew at the same time. The bad thing is you can't set the timer to go off automatically when you are just waking up, because you risk it overlowing when you are still in bed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,Take great beans and brew mediocre coffee!,"Yes, take great beans and brew mediocre coffee! Or possibly wake up to coffee flowing across your kitchen counter and down into the cabinets. Hard to clean and tiresome to look at, the Cuisinart grind and brew has finally lost its place in our house and this morning, after another disaster, our machine (after only seven months) is heading for the garbage can. It was hard to clean and never really made a great cup of coffee despite the best ingredients. Programming was tedious and assembly of the parts, water and coffee each evening was simply not what one wanted to do at bedtime. Its vaguely retro stainless steel veneer was impossible to maintain. So it's back to straightforward French coffee presses for this household - and (Joy!) finally a decent cup of coffee. We'll be skeptical about future Cuisinart purchases. And trust us, dear reader, you do not want the hassle of this imperfect machine."
1,Poorly made!!,"I purchased this coffeemaker about a year ago. Although it's a little cumbersome, it got the job done. I have used it almost daily. One month ago, a small piece of the grinder cover broke, thus rendering the entire appliance non-functional. Yes, that's right, even if you don't want to use the grinder, the coffee maker WILL NOT FUNCTION without that piece. So I ordered another one for $10.00 from Cuisinart.com, asked for quick shipping, and waited. After multiple phone calls to them (no correspondence from their end) I have learned that the part is ""backordered,"" that many people are waiting for it (another sign that it's poorly made) and that it might be more than another month before I see that piece. Meanwhile, the thing is collecting dust. I have tried to get refunded the price of the coffeemaker, but it's ""out of warranty"" so I'm ""out of luck."" So my recommendation to anyone considering this appliance is look elsewhere. I would NOT buy another Cuisinart if my life depended on it."
1,The Teeth Grinder Coffee Maker,"I grind my teeth everytime I use this Coffee Maker. I just recently recieved this coffee maker as a gift. It must of been from someone is extremely mad at me! I am taking it back today. Within the 2 weeks that I have had this THING, my coffee has over flowed, I couldn't get it open and the grinder is a royal pain. I love fresh grind coffee but this thing is a pain. You have to clean it everyday after every use. The plastic top gets filled up with steam and cakes the ground coffee to every little nook inside. This is one of the poorest made coffee makers I have ever used. Do yourself a favor and buy a separte grinder for you coffee!!"
2,"Good idea, bad execution","Coffee is good and stays hot for a while. Although I do agree with some others that the coffee is not as hot initially as it could be. The bean grinder does a good job for a medium grind, but the dust gets wet during the brew cycle and cakes onto everything. Lots of cleaning after every brew. This particularly stinks when serving multiple guests and another pot is necessary. As for the button-ejected basket... this is the killer. After one year the basket will randomly open during the brew cycle and flood my kitchen with coffee. No response from Cuisinart since I am past the 1 year warranty. Personally, I would steer clear from this pot."
1,Don't be fooled,"This machine is a great disappointment. The Grind & Brew concept is a design failure. As stated in another review, this machine requires extensive cleaning of 5 or 6 parts much more frequently than other coffee makers. The design flaw is that the grinder is filled with steam on every brewing, caking the grinds in every nook and cranny and requiring messy cleaning after every brew."
2,This product will not simplify your life,"Mercifully, my Grind 'n Brew has finally given up (some electrical problem caused it to cease brewing seconds after starting. It finally died completely). Now I realize how much I struggled with this product. Most annoying was the cleaning process. As mentioned in earlier reviews, all brew components must be washed and completely dried before setting up subsequent brewing. The release latch for the brew basket malfunctions, randomly popping the door open, resulting in a river of coffee across the floor.The product brews good coffee but it's way over the top in terms of user effort to get there.I give it points for being a single process grind and brew and its reliable programming, but I will happily return to my coffee grinder -- which remains DRY -- paired with a simple, programmable coffee maker.I admit that I did use it for years, but I truly regret having purchased this product."
1,Fundamental design flaws,"K... here's the deal. Putting a coffee grinder inside the same housing as the brewing takes place is just plain retarded. Every time you make a pot of coffee, your grinder gets all moist and you have to clean it out in between pots so your fresh beans don't stick to the sides like some sort of coffee paste. (I finally gave up using the grinder altogether). But, ironically, the carafe is too small to fit your hand into and a scrub brush isn't rigid enough, so the you can't clean the inside of the carafe! Then, the little springy thing that pushes in when you put the carafe into place that allows the coffee to flow into the carafe, and not out onto your countertop along with all of the coffee grinds, intermittently failed to push in. That was the last straw. I donated it and bought a Mr. Coffee."
1,A tremendous disappointment,"The thermal carafe is about the only thing I liked in this machine.It is huge and awkward and difficult to load. There are many pieces to assemble, and they become quickly caked with bean pulp which is messy and inconvenient to clean. The brew basket drain valve often becomes clogged, which simultaneously causes the basket to overflow from the backup while leaving the drain open if the carafe is removed.This morning, I mopped up its spewed hot coffee and grounds from my kitchen counter for the last irritating time. I'm going back to a low budget Mr. Coffee to remember the little pleasures of using a product the does something simple correctly.The only way this device would ever be worth $132 would be if you lived in a zone where you could pack the reservior with sufficient dynamite to blast the thing back to the architectural demon world which spawned it."
4,"Good coffee, bad cleanup.","There seems to be a theme in this reviews!Yes, it is good coffee, and I love being able to set the grinding to happen the night before. There are no heating coils for the carafe, but the coffee will stay hot enough to drink for several hours - and it'll still taste good!But it is loud in the morning, and I can hear it all the way upstairs. In addition, the cleaning is a pain - so much so that some mornings I choose to go out for coffee instead of having to deal with the cleanup.Generally, I'm happy with my purchase. My next coffee maker will be a separate maker and grinder, though."
1,the worst coffee maker in the world!,this coffee maker has NEVER made a good pot of coffee. the thermal carafe doesn't hold the temperature and the manufacturer recommends that you shake up the coffee in the carafe in order to mix it well...that's just insane!buy a percolator rather than this useless piece of junk. it is difficult to clean and that grinder isn't worth bothering with.cuisinart really screwed up on this one!
3,Cuisinart Grind and Brew,"Up until 3 months ago, this was the best coffee maker I have owned. When the Cuisinart turned 1 year old, it decided to brew partial pots only...perhaps it has entered the terrible twos a bit early. I usually have to push the brew button 4 times to get it to finish brewing the pot. I have contacted Cuisinart about this problem, and have been instructed to ship it to them, and a replacement will be sent out.I don't mind doing that, but can not imagine having to use my old Mr Coffe while I am waiting for the replacement. This coffee maker is wonderful...when it works. I have not had a bad cup of coffee, unless I leave the house.I gave this item 3 stars in my rating, because I expect a better built product from Cuisinart. It was my Mothers choice of small kitchen appliances, and mine also. I hope Cuisinart fixes the problem, I notice I am one of many who has experienced the same auto shut-off problem."
2,Way over-priced for what you get !,"Though this machine does make good coffee, and the coffee cannot get stale, I am very disappointed because it continually breaks down. I've already had to replace my coffee maker twice (fortunately Cuisinart did honor their warranty without any problems), and now it's broken again. I give up. I'm now in the market for a more reliable, and cheaper model. I didn't have these problems with my simple old Mr. Coffee machine. I wonder if they make a termal machine?? Anyway... I've just had nothing but continual problems with the Cuisinart Thermal Grind & Brew machine. It's definitely not worth what you pay for it. Consider yourself warned."
2,Worthless!!,Worst coffee maker I have ever owned. Can't measure water in pot. Have to press buttons for every pot up to 4 cups and another button if don't want to use grind and brew. But worst part is that I have had trouble with it since the get go. It is supposed to be factory reconditioned but after 3 months has a mind of its' own. I got mine from Smart Bargains who told me I had no recourse other than to contact Cuisinart. Guess I learned not to buy reconditioned or from Smart Bargains!
5,It does it all and looks good on the counter,"This was a real upgrade for our coffee habit! This maker is easy to use and clean and it makes great coffee. Our favorite feature is the thermos carafe; keeps brew hot a long time, is easy to move to the table for refills and will not break! We also like the integrated grinder - less mess! Finally, the parts are all easy to remove for cleaning and reassembling. This item has turned out to be even better than we expected!"
2,Major Design Flaws,"This machine was a huge disappointment. I am amazed that it was brought to market with its signifcant engineering problems. I returned it for the following reasons:1: Steam- When you brew a pot, the ENTIRE machine- grinder, bean hopper, etc. fills with steam. The unground beans get wet, and the residual grinds turn to paste. It's a huge mess every time you make a pot.2: Carafe- leaks. It is impossible to pour out the final 2 cups without spilling half on the counter.3: Weak coffee- The grinder will only take enough beans to make about half a pot of decent coffee. If you use the max amount of beans and try to make a full pot, you get brown water.4: There are a bunch of little plastic parts that you have to clean and replace every time you set it up.On the plus side, it looks pretty cool and makes excellent coffee (in small amounts)- probably thanks to the charcoal water filter."
1,Don't buy if you like stronger coffee,"Could never really get teh grinder to grind enough beans to make a decent cup of coffee. Even though you have the option to put in pre-ground coffee, I could still never place enough int eh filter without it making a mess. Most expensive coffee maker I ever bought and I threw it away after a couple frustrating weeks."
4,Stands up over time,"I have had this for FIVE YEARS! I make coffee every day. It's loud, it's a pain to clean, however, it makes good coffee and it's last us a long time. Oh, and it looks nice in my stainless kitchen."
4,Great Coffeemaker,"Overall I have been really happy with this coffeemaker. The best things about it are the grinder and the wire basket it comes with which makes the coffee taste great. It's also compact enough to fit in my apartment kitchen, and saves me from having to have a coffee grinder on the counter too.The only thing I don't like is the noise of the grinder. It is way louder than my old coffee grinder. It kind of sounds like a cross between a jet and a police siren. I always feel like I'm annoying my neighbors when I turn it on.All in all though, I would recommend it. Who needs neighbors when you have delicious coffee anyways?"
5,"Love this coffeemaker, even after 2.5 years!","I have had this coffeemaker for two and a half years and I still love it. My husband and I make coffee with it every day and we have never had any problems. The coffee we make with this machine is so good, that when we visit friends and family, my husband has to go out and buy coffee from Starbucks because that is the only thing that compares to what we make at home. We always buy whole beans and we always clean it out and make it that morning. I am actually about to buy another one for work, which is how I came back here to review it in the first place. So, I am off to buy my second Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew, I hope this review helps you find what you are looking for!"
1,watch yourself with this one,"I bought at Cuisinart DGB600BC Grind and Brew coffee machine over a year ago.Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew, Brushed Chrome. When it began to swing open during the grind or brew stage I thought it was my fault. After a year of observing, I can report that when it swings open during grinding, you get a coffeepot covered with grinds. When it swings open during the brew cycle, you get a counterful of coffee stains to mop up. There is no cutoff device to stop the machine when these mishaps take place. So you have to stand over it, or take your chances. An old time coffee pot on the stove is more reliable"
2,Looks Good Bad Design,"The Cuisinart Coffee machine looks good, but is idiotically designed. At 5'3"", I am too short to pour coffee into the reservoir without spilling it all over the --standard height--counter. So, I set up the rest of the coffee and my husband pours it. Idiotic! Pouring coffee is a pain, too--you can pour it with lid on, but it pours REALLY slowly. Remove lid and pour and coffee spills all over. Cleanup is also a pain with all the parts. The coffee tastes fine, however. The other day I put beans in and the machine began to beep out of nowhere. I had to unplug it for awhile, then reprogram. What a pain! Finally, when setting timer, not that PM comes up first--completely counter intuitive if you ask me--so you must cycle through to AM. It was expensive, so I will hang onto it for at least awhile--unless I throw it out the window because I get pissed at it."
4,surprisingly sturdy,"I've used one of these daily now for three years. My initial impression, when purchasing the machine, was that the plastic wouldn't hold up. It has. Still makes great coffee. The grinder, going off at 5:30 am, will wake the dead. We are now used to it, but need to warn house guests."
5,Husband Loves it!,"I bought this for him last spring and he still loves it. Not one complaint, and he said the grind works great."
4,Grind and Brew,"We had a Cuisinart ""Grind and Brew"" my wife loved, it did however break down three times with-in the warranty period. Cuisinart fixed or replaced it, but the shipping costs were an unexpected cost. She loved the product and its output so much I bought her a new one; however after receiving it we discovered a much cheaper local price."
1,Not worth the money,"I received this as a wedding gift and thought it would be the answer to my problems. No more separate grinding. NOT THE CASE. First of all - the coffee is never hot at all. Who likes room temperature coffee? Next, the cup for the beans is so small it never makes strong coffee ever. When I make a full pot of coffee I fill up the cup with beans and also use ground coffee in the filter. I have had this machine for about two years now and on two separate occasions (only when company was over) did I have to go rescue my countertop from grinds and coffee all over it. What a nightmare."
2,"GOOD COFFEE, BAD DESIGN","This makes really good coffee, but cleaning the grinder is a major pain. You also need to clean the lid to the filter every time and it makes a mess taking it off and on. You can not fit your hand inside the carafe to clean it, so I'm reduced to using a sponge and a pair of tongs to get inside. We've had this for a little over a year and the grinder is no longer working properly. It leaves half the ground beans inside so I have to turn off the coffee maker, pull out the grinder and empty the grounds into the filter...put everything back and then turn it back on to brew."
1,I have to agree. with previous reviews.....,"I have to agree that this coffee maker is less than I had expected. Coffee is lukewarm and for some reason it leaks water onto my counter with every use. I'm constantly cleaning up my counter top. This is my third Cuisinart coffee maker and once it quits, I'll not buy another."
3,Meh,"Difficult to see water level. Grinder is preset--grinds too long & leaves residue in carafe. Other than that, it's OK. Coffee still tastes good, & when I wake up, it's ready."
2,Cuisinart grind & brew,Our Cuisinart is less than a year old and the front panel to open to clean the filter is constantly jammed. The door does not slide in nor will it slide closed without a hard push. Very disappointed with the product considering how much we payed. I'm going back to a regular coffee maker
1,"coffee lover, pot hater","This coffee pot was excellent when I first purchased it. The coffee tasted wonderful and it was always hot and brewed quickly. It hasn't been a year yet and the coffee takes for ever to brew, there are grounds in the brewed coffee and worst of all the coffee pours out all over the counter. Rarely do you get a whole pot of coffee. It still tastes great but what a mess. It is also very hard to fill the water resevoir with water. Cleaning is a chore.This is my third cusinart coffee pot in 5 years and I will never buy another one from them. They look great work well at first but do not last. I thought I just had bad coffee pot karma but I think its the company. Time to find another brand."
2,difficult to use,"We have had this maker for over a year and could not really recommed it. The grinder is VERY loud, and can be heard all through the house, to the dismay of those sho do not have to get up early, this can be turned off, but that sort of defeats the purpose. The lid to the pot is very hard to get off and gets harder as time goes on, my wife now has to get me to remove the lid. Cleaning it is another chore, the coffee compartment has to me very clean and very dry or the coffee sticks and does not go to the filter. I am about ready tp go back to a $30.00 Mr Coffee!"
2,worked great ..... for a while,"Cuisinart (DGB-900BC) 12 Cup Grind & Brew Coffeemaker (Brushed Chrome) + (ED150) Bean Vac Coffee Canister.... Set the automatic timer and then the filter drawer kept popping open when the grinder started ...WHAT A MESS ... grounds spattered everywhere!!! But the worse thing was that the water brewing would miss the pot and there would be water everywhere. Gee the timer function was useless because i would have to stand there and hold the drawer closed until all functions were done! On another note ... cuisinarts rice cookerCuisinart CRC-800 8-Cup Rice Cooker.... kept scorching my rice on warm and also would bubble and spatter all over the counter ... they replaced it! I had the same problems. I threw it away! Cuisinart? What happened to your quality??? Spend a few extra dollars and buy the VitaClayVitaClay VF7900-3 Chef Gourmet 6-Cup Rice and Slow Cooker Pro, Brushed Stainless.... perfection personified!"
2,Great coffee! Lousy machine!!!!,"Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew, Brushed ChromeThis was a replacement for a defective machine 2 years ago. Due to the mess the grinder makes, we purchased a burr grinder and love it. Now this machine is leaking, leaving a puddle of clear water underneath it with each brew.I have put off contacting customer service due to their nasty (New Jersey) telephone reps, who insinuated that the problems had to be my fault, saying I must not be cleaning it correctly, that the defective door that always flew open was my fault, and didn't even attempt to address the issue of the intermittent electrical problems. I had to resort to emails to get help and this replacement, but even then my email address was blocked after I suggested that they should move the cust. service to the midwest, where people are more polite. Too funny!! It's pretty pathetic when a company's product can't even make it to the warranty expiration before puking!!! No more Cuisinart junk for me!!!"
1,Don't bother,"Don't even bother with this product. I bought 2 different machines and returned them both. If the coffee carafe isn't in the exact right position, the coffee leaks down the back of the machine and spills out all over the counter. The grinder is incredibly loud and the beeps when the coffee is finished would wake a bear from hibernation."
4,"Good coffee, high maintenance","this makes great coffee, the only downsides are it is noisy - the cats still are not use to the noise after several months, and that you have to clean it after each use. In reality grinding my coffee in a separate grinder made much more of a mess, so once you get into the daily clean-up habit, you'll LOVE this coffee maker!"
1,Go buy a $20 unit from Walmart instead!!!,"After only ONE YEAR I'm done with this thing and going to Walmart to buy a cheapie because....1. Grinding device is stuck so can't ever clean it again (hard to clean to begin with)2. Leaks all over my counter3. It's not really done when it beeps, so coffee, once again, all over my counter4. I have to use x-ray vision to see how much water I'm putting in the thing (ps- I don't have x-ray vision)"
2,"Horrible carafe lid, Average tasting coffee","The taste of the brewed coffee is adequate. However, I cannot get past the lid on the carafe. It just will not pour. It dribbles. It drips. But doesn't really pour. It's almost like the lid is clogged. But I've talked to others with this unit and they say their lid works the same way. So I guess I just don't like a carafe that pours slowly and sloppily."
2,Mediocre coffee maker for a lot of money,"I received this coffee maker as a Christmas gift last year. I thought, good brand, high price, ought to be a great coffee maker, right? WRONG! The carafe leaks every time I try to pour a cup of coffee - I even called Cuisinart and they sent me a new lid, which only stopped the leaks for about a week. Also, it takes forever to brew a pot of coffee. I prefer my $20.00 Braun to this overpriced pice of junk."
4,Better than expected,"I recently purchased the Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew Thermal coffee pot for my husband as an anniversary present. I read several of the reviews and was concerned about some of the critisism about it. So far, I have been happy with this item. It does take a little more work as you need to clean the coffee grinder after each use, but it doesn't take long to clean (maybe 1 minute.) The grinder is quieter than I thought it would be and it grinds the coffee very fine leaving no big pieces that some have claimed it does. It is made of stainless steel and it looks wonderful. I would recommend using a stainless steel polish on it to make it look better. My only major complaint is that you have to tip the caraffe almost upside down to pour the coffee. Overall, we are happy and my husband loved it."
3,It makes a great cup of coffee,"Okay I admit it, I got this coffee maker because I was lazy. I didn't like having to grind the coffee, put it in the basket and set up the maker to brew, while I was half asleep in the morning. But I found cleaning this maker is just as much trouble as grinding the coffee separately. This is my first grinding coffee maker, so I didn't realize that it would require so much cleaning after every use... I am not really worried about the cheapness of the construction of the Cuisinart. I just treat it gently. I do worry about the wear that is showing on the grinding bowl and lid. Though I still have my old sturdy machine and separate grinder, I am not using them, because I love the coffee that comes from this initiating machine."
2,Disappointed,If you want a 747 taking off in your kitchen then this is the machine for you. Too Noisy! Too many parts to clean even when you don't use the grinder and finally the timer malfunctioned and I sent the machine back. Amazon was great and gave me a complete refund. I would strongly suggest the CAPRESSO brand. It has a coffee maker with an attached grinder that does not get wet. I bought the Coffee Tec with the froth express and it is terrific. I would pass on this machine.
2,Grinder is too messy to use.,"We have had ours for less than a year. The pros and cons are as follow:Pros: Water filter cleans water as it comes through the pot.Stainless steel keeps coffee hot longer and fresh.Makes coffee faster than others.Cons: We never use the grinder because it makes a big mess.It is very, very hard to add water. If you are not at least 5'7"" you will need a stool to look inside the pot to see the waterline for the water and to not over filled.We now need a second for another home but hope to find something without these flaws."
2,The Cuisnart Leaker,The caraffe lid leaks coffee when it is poured. I have to hold it over the sink to pour a cup of coffee.The grinder and all the other parts have to be washed after each use. Washing and drying the grinder is inconvenient.
3,Cuisinart Grind & Brew,"This appliance makes good coffee but is very hard to clean, and the carafe does not pour well. Steam enters the grinder and turns the bean residue into a real mess. I'd prefer a warming unit under the carafe to the thermal carafe. Although it does keep coffee hot for a while, coffee must be reheated if you wait too long."
1,Think twice,"I purchased a DGB-600BC grind and brew about a year ago and wish that I did not. While the overall performance, interms of coffee quality, etc. is good, the inconvenience of using this dwarfs the benefits.Key Shortcomings:1. With a full pot of coffee, carafe ALWAYS drips coffee down the side and onto the counter2. Moisture flows up into the grinder mechanism, meaning that it must be cleaned every time (failure to do so will mean a BIG mess3. When using pre-ground beans (not me preference), must be careful not to use more than 10 tbs of the water will overflow - makes it impossible to make strong coffee from pre-ground beans when making a full pot.Bottom line - you're MUCH better off with a good stand-alone grinder and quality coffeee maker than with this one."
2,Sadly disappointing!,"I was very sad to return this coffee maker. I love the idea of a grind and brew unit. After a year of problems - the basket popping out mid-brew, getting stuck when I wanted it to open, and finally, coffee brewing OUT of the pot and on to my kitchen counter and floor...I called Cuisinart. I read the serial number on the bottom of the unit to the customer service rep who told me that it was under warranty for three years and to return it to place of purchase. I did."
3,The Gift of the White Elephant,"I recently received this coffee maker as a birthday gift. After using it each day for two weeks, I am reminded of the ""Gift of the White Elephant.""In order to show his appreciation to a loyal subject, the king bestowed upon him the rarest prize in all the kingdom...a white elephant. The subject was terribly impressed at this lavish gift, yet as time went by, the reality of maintaining a white elephant soon proved extremely taxing. Within a short period of time, the subject and his family were peniless and ruined from both the physical and financial responsibility of owning such a lavish gift.This coffee maker is gorgeous, modern, and brews outstanding coffee. You will have to care for and clean the unit each time you use it. Brewing coffee will become a half hour endeavor each day.Enjoy, and remember...this coffee maker loves peanuts!"
1,Have finally accepted that this is a piece of junk!,"Got this coffee maker as a Christmas gift a little over a year ago. At first, it seemed to work fine, and I even wrote a very nice review here. But I have had it with this coffee maker. The Brew 'n Pause feature does not work. You remove the caraf, and it just keeps right on pouring. About every other time, it overflows the basket, spilling coffee and grounds all over the counter top. You have to watch it like a hawk right after you start brewing coffee in case this starts to happen. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a timer so coffee is ready when you wake up!Stay away from this overpriced piece of junk. It took me more than a year to accept this reality since I paid so much money, but I finally unplugged it today and said enough!"
1,This is my first review of a product,"This product created enormous messes!!!! Bad functional design, was probably NEVER prototyped.The grinder needs to be absolutely clean and dry even w/ steam (from brewing) gets all inside the grinder. Grinder never sends coffee to the filter.The coffee pot (on the thermos) valve gets stuck and over flows (all over).The coffee pot needs to positioned perfectly to accept coffee from above."
1,Not my Idea of a coffee maker,"Others before me have written about the poor points of this brewer. Neither my wife or I are mechanically inept, but, we never did get this thing to make a cup of coffee. Yes, we filled with water, plugged in, set time/date ground coffee read instructions umpteen times, closed doors 45 minutes later still no coffee. reboxed and going back asap.Looks great, works lousey."
4,This thing is great if you are a tech-lover,"We actually bought our Grind and Brew used and it has been working well for us. It is a little high-maintenance, but fortunately I am one of those people who like high-maintenance appliances. I clean it meticulously every night and it has continued to work beautifully for us. The coffee is not incredible but still good, and it's nice to have fresh beans ground for you. All in all, a good purchase and very convenient for anyone without time to make fresh-ground coffee in the morning."
2,"Plastic, a pain to clean, good coffee and nice looking.","This is the typical cheaply made plastic coffee maker, hardly worth the price unless you are more concerned with appearance than quality.There are no less than 7 parts to clean after every pot of coffee, what a pain!Makes better coffee than the Melita grind and brew even without the adjustable grind (but requires more beans). The Melita left a plastic taste for a year and promptly broke once the coffee started to taste good.Unit comes with a great thermal caraffe that keeps coffee warm for HOURS without getting too strong.Scott's Opinion - Go with a separate grinder and quality brewer, or get the Melita, suck it up for a year and be really careful with the fragile little plastic clips and catches."
3,"Good coffee, but very high maintenance and marginal quality","I received this as a gift last Christmas. Makes a good cup o' joe, but washing everything every single dang day was a bit of a hassle. After a year of use it seems something has broken forcing me to get out the channel lock pliers in order to remove the grinder basket.I have been enthusiastically pleased with my other Cuisinart products, this one not so much...."
2,Piece of Junk,"I accidentally dropped the carafe and broke the handle. I went to the Cuisinart replacement part website, but no handle available. I called customer service to find out if I could purchase just a handle, and they said they don't offer just handles. I would have to replace the entire pot--at a cost of $48.00. How convenient for them--they make a really cheap handle and don't offer it as a replacement part. This is the last Cuisinart product I will ever buy. In addition, it doesn't pour well--I have to remove the lid every time to pour a cup of coffee. Also, the grinder is a pain to clean--coffee gets into every nook and cranny."
2,cuisinart decanter stinks,"The decanter for coffee is designed so poorly , that the coffee comes out extremely slow . There is an inside lip in the decanter that creates a 1 "" rim that the coffee must travel over before coming out - thus a slow process. If the decanter was a normal one , I would give this coffee maker a 3 out of 5 stars . The other bad thing is it is a little time consuming to clean the grinder after each use."
4,"Great Coffeemaker, but not entirely dishwasher safe","We've had this coffeemaker for about 4 years now. We noticed recently that the carafe was no longer keeping heat very long at all, and recently had to purchase a replacement carafe. Do NOT put the carafe in the dishwasher, bottom line.This coffeemaker requires a little bit of effort. You have to clean all of the parts every day. But it's a lot less messy and a lot more accurate than measuring out the grounds and grinding them in a separate container. If you have to have freshly ground coffee, this coffeemaker is perfect for you.As for the carafe, it worked great for the first couple of years we had it. We're going to ignore the manufacturer's directions that it's dishwasher safe and hope that our (quite expensive at 1/3 the total cost fo the coffeemaker!) carafe is as good as the old one used to be if we don't destroy it in the dishwasher."
2,Overly Complex Design,"Coffee makers with a built-in grinder are a good idea. I bought this one to replace a Toshiba model that served us well for many years and made great coffee. In the Toshiba the grinder was in the filter basket allowing you to control the coarsness of the grind by setting the grinding time with a little spring-loaded timer. This Cuisinart has separate grinder and filter basket so the grinder has to blow the ground coffee into the filter basket as well as grind it. Because of this, you have no control over the grind. You also have more parts to clean. Other pros and cons of this machine are well stated by other reviewers. Bottom line: It makes mediocre coffee. It's not worth the money. Buy a separate coffee grinder to use with your coffee maker if you have to. Back to the drawing board, Cuisinart. I want my Toshiba back."
1,Don't waste your money,"This was by far the worst coffee pot I have ever purchased. At first it made fabulous coffee. However, things just never worked correctly after 3 months. It wouldn't continuously brew a full pot of coffee for whatever reason. It was an arduous task to clean it. It was a great day when I got rid of this coffeemaker."
3,At least it lasted,"When I bought this machine about four years ago I referred to it as the single worst appliance purchase of my life and I warned my friends off of the product. Four years on it has finally died due to what appears to be an electrical short in the grinding mechanism, so in my experience it outlasted the average coffee maker. The machine did a nice job of grinding the beans and the coffee was fine. The door for the filter basket stayed in place and auto/anti-drip mechanism worked without fail. My primary gripes about the unit when it was new were the noise it makes when grinding the coffee, which is akin to a turbine winding up and the need to clean and dry the grinder on a daily basis. I got in the habit of grinding in the evening to avoid running afoul of the city noise ordinance and the daily cleaning became a part of my morning ritual. And at the end of the day it is probably good practice to clean the unit on a daily basis. I will not be buying the same model as a replacement."
5,Ahh-smell the coffee,"I got this for my husband and he loves it. I read all the reviews before purchasing it, and can't figure out how anyone can complain about the ""noise."" Apparently they never tried to use other grinders, which are way more noisy & messy besides. We don't pre-heat the carafe with hot water, and the coffee stays hot for hours. It does take a bit of clean-up, with especial attention needed for the grinder base to remove a buildup of residue, but any coffee maker should be thoroughly cleaned for good tasting coffee to continue to be made, so....get over it or hire a housekeeper. Either you want good brewed coffee at home or you want sheer convenience."
4,Makes great coffee and keeps it hot. Period.,"After 6 months of daily use of this coffeemaker, I feel qualified to write a review. In summary: It makes coffee and keeps it hot - hotter longer than any other thermal I've used. It works as well now, after about 100 uses, as it did the first time.Yes, this machine requires about 45 seconds of extra work each day to rinse out the parts. Big deal.Yes, the grinder is loud. It's a grinder, and unlike hand-helds, you aren't dampening it by holding it - so it's pretty damn loud.Here's a tip to people who are stunned that brewing into a cold carafe causes their coffee to cool: It's a good machine, but it unfortunately doesn't break the laws of thermodynamics. You need to rinse a metal carafe under hot water if you do not want coffee to cool slightly.Here is my one big complaint: the grinder does not hold enough beans to make 10 cups of strong coffee. I overfill the grinder and can get about 8 strong cups.I would purchase this item again."
1,Drink it fast - coffee does not stay hot,"Looks great, makes great coffee, the grind is really loud, but it just doesn't keep the coffee hot!! After 15 minutes the coffee is cold. The carafe is the only item which trys to keep the heat. There is no hot plate. They recommend to fill the carafe with hot water and let it sit to heat up the carafe then make your coffee. But I set a timer in the morning to not have to do steps like that. Horrible, I returned it."
4,Great coffee,"This coffeemaker is well worth the money and the time spent on a bit of extra cleanup every day. It makes great, consistent coffee. It keeps it warm for a really long time. Get some Weiman Stainless Steel wipes and keep the outside looking great. Yes, you do have to wash and dry the interior components each day, but I think it's worth it. You can do everything at night before you go to bed, set the timer, and wake up to great coffee. The only issue I have is that it only makes 10 cups. Oh, and the grinder is pretty loud."
1,don't,"I would strongly advise to not buy a grind and brew machine. It is too loud, sounds like an airplane taking off, has way too many components and is difficult to clean, does not keep coffee warm enough and is hard to pour from the karafe.Just grind your beans where they are away from moisture and use a normal coffee pot."
3,The grinder lasts about 2 years,"We have had two and we don't grind that often.Makes good coffee and stays warm.Our first unit lost a bearing and made an awful noise or second the bearing seems to have froze.I'd say we grind 30% so 2 years seems short.A rating of 2.5 would more appropriate.Update, it totally went bonkers this week about 6 months after grinder died."
5,Long-Lasting,"I've had this coffee maker since 2007 and it has never given me any problems. Perfect grind and the thermal carafe keeps coffee hot till lunch. It is very easy to take apart and clean, anyone who says otherwise is lazy. I am surprised by the bad reviews."
1,Made to last 1 year!!!,"I love to have freshly ground coffee every morning. So I bought my first Cuisinart grind and brew coffee machine, about 4 years ago. I have gone through 4 different models of Cuisinart grind and brews each lasting 1 year!!! I used to think that Cuisinart was a great brand. But their grind are brew coffee makers are JUNK!!! My fourth one just broke a few days ago, I have had the same two problems with each one of them. Either the pot itself leaks, or the burner stops working. I am currently in the market for a new brand of grind and brews, if you have any suggestions let me know!!!"
2,Good looks ain`t everything,"It's a very nice looking coffee machine, but it always leaves a mess. The filter pops open while the coffee is still brewing, it over floats quite often and you end up with a lot of coffee grinds in your coffee"
1,Worst coffee pot I have ever owned,"Buy this one only if your hobby is cleaning up coffee grounds and spills for about 30 minutes a day. This morning, the front door popped open during the grind cycle and blew coffee grounds all over my white counter tops and floor. This is a regular occurrence. This also happened in spite of the duct tape wrapped around the machine to hold it closed. Avoid this coffee maker...run for the exits...call in the experts for an exorcism. (Need I say more?) I Have taped this Cuisinart to the top of my outside garbage can to serve as mute testimony of lousy workmanship and design. The garbage man may not even take it!!!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"I've been using this coffeemaker for some time now. I have to say that it produces a fine cup of coffee. However, it is a pain to use.I like the idea of a grinder and brewer combination coffeemaker, but I think they need more innovation because the product needs some improvement.I stopped programming the coffeemaker because on rare occasions the grinding/brewer cycle would start and somehow blow open the maker. The result was a disaster. Grounds everywhere and crappy coffee.Another thing I don't like is that it's difficult to clean. In fact, it's a tedious process that takes too long.Again, I like the coffee. I just don't like a coffeemaker that's a diva."
2,"Great coffee, but the machine is a disaster in your kitchen","We are on our second Grind & Brew machine because we love the taste of the coffee, but the product is a piece of crap. The grinder stopped working on our first machine. On our second machine, the basket drawer pops our midway through brewing so coffee spills all over the counter. We actually have to keep an elastic band wrapped around it to contain it. The coffee is full bodied and delicious, but this is a disaster in your kitchen."
1,Do Not Buy,This Coffee maker is great for the first 6 months then the basket keeps popping out and the coffee pours all over the place. do not buy this one
2,If you are considering a factory refurbished DGB-600...,"I'm glad to see this model has been discontinued.It worked positively great for the first year and a half. Then it started shutting off mid-brew. We have reached the point where we have to restart it 3 or 4 times to make a 8-cup pot of coffee.It is a frustrating endeavor as a consumer to purchase products with very short functioning life. Price has no bearing on quality (friends with a $2k coffeemaker from W-S have had the same issue.) I'm really glad I only paid $60 for this model at a crazy New Years Day sale. All electronics are garbage these days. Besides being out the money to purchase, you have the added frustration of things breaking at inconvenient times, and then the time spent re-researching products and repurchasing expenses.At this point, I'm considering getting a french press. My experience definitely won't have me back to purchasing another Cuisinart model.Two stars because it was great during it's short duration."
1,Sad Disappointment,"We were given this coffee maker as a gift for Christmas, and it has been a sad disappointment, indeed. The carafe will keep coffee lukewarm for six hours, and the coffee maker brews at a temperature a little hotter than lukewarm. So... if you enjoy stale, lukewarm coffee... this is the system for you! I drink my coffee fresh and hot, and it's not possible to get a hot cup of coffee with this system. At the price they charge, they should have made the brew temperature adjustable, but they didn't. I'm sure someone at Cuisinart thought he had the brew temperature right, but that is a matter of personal preference. For example, some people think America should be a Marxist nation, and I don't. Do you see how diferent people sometimes are from each other? Sadly disappointed."
1,I hate this coffee maker!,HIGH maintainence! Must clean several parts every time you make coffee. Occasionally the door pops open while brewing and coffee and grounds go everywhere. Takes 2 scoops more coffee to make a pot than my Capresso. Would not recommend!
1,Don't bother,"We've gone through a couple Cuisinart Grind and Brews, both were junk. They need to be cleaned completely between uses and they are a pain to clean. They begin to leak after only a couple years and then need to be replaced. The door with the basket will occasionally pop open half way through the cycle so you can wake up to coffee all over the counter. This coffeemaker is a total waste of money. We acquired a Melitta Mill and Brew that is vastly superior but it doesn't appear to be available anymore, pity."
1,Cuisine Art Grind & Brew Thermal Coffee Maker,"My new coffee maker is a big disappointment. First, the high maintenance grinder has to be completely washed and dried between uses. Second, it uses at least 25% more coffee beans to get the same taste as my old coffee maker. Third, about once a week the door to the basket pops open and I wake up to coffee spewed all over the counter!"
2,A Pain to Clean and Lukewarm Coffee,"We got this coffeemaker as a wedding present and used it for a little over a year before I finally got fed up with it and got a new one. There are two major flaws. The first is that a lot of steam goes into the grinding compartment which means it has to be cleaned between each and every pot to keep it from getting all gunked up. Also if you don't use the grinding portion it still has to be occasionally cleaned because the steam collects in there and it will eventually mold and mildew if not cleaned. The other flaw is that it just doesn't get the coffee very hot. If you like cream in your coffee you will have to nuke it. The flavor of the coffee is fine, but the design is very poor. They need to redesign it so that the steam doesn't get into the grinding portion and ditch the thermal carafe for a standard glass one with a burner."
4,HIgh Class Coffee Pot!,"This coffee pot rocks!! The grind & brew is a great coffee maker. Love the sleek modern look. Grinder is a bit loud, lots of parts to clean daily, which are kind of a pain to take apart. Keeps coffee hot for at least an hour. If you dont want to use the grinder you have to shut it off first before you turn the coffee pot on to brew. Love the auto shut off right when coffee is done and the little sound it makes when the coffee is done. Looks great with my stainless steel appliances. I Love this coffee pot! My husband wasnt really crazy about the way the coffee pours out, you must open the lid first or the coffee just trickles out. Maybe I'd get the bigger carafe, it makes about 10 cups. A great high-end coffee pot for a great price! Love it!"
4,"Makes good coffee, lots of parts to wash","It is a classy looking machine and reasonably priced for a machine that grinds beans for FRESH coffee. Programming is easy. Like many other reviewers note, there are a lot of parts to wash, approximately 6, after making a pot. I wash everything, but some people may not think that certain part always need washed. The thermal caraffe works great and keeps the coffee hot a long time - longer if you pre-heat it by rinsing some hot water in it prior to brewing. Probably would buy again."
5,The best quality in the best delivery time.,It's the first time that I buy something over amazon and I have to say I am very impressed with the service and the quality of the product.
2,buy a different SARK book (not this one),"I LOVE SARK. I do. She is a source of much inspiration and I bought my first book many years ago. That's why when in the 158 section of the library I saw her name on the spine and thought ""oh good"" and took it home.I would really like to give it more than 2 stars but can't. It's just too disjointed. Too filled with reading lists of other books instead of SARK. It seems very unfocused (OK more unfocused than normal for SARK).The best part I found -and I was looking-are pages 182-190. There are other good parts but lots of ramblings (again more so for the author).I will look for some of her other books because she is gifted and enjoyable to read. And I wish I could really recommend this book.2.5 stars maybe but not 3."
2,Book,"I received this book. Althought the content is great, I don't like the illustration and feel like I'm reading a hand written journal of a child. I would have preferred it to be a typed style book. I would still recommend it to friends for the overall information. The book was purchased used and in excellent condition as described. I will continue to order items from this company. Thanks."
2,There are better books than this one,"... I was very disappointed with it. My basic contention is that this book lacks substance - for me, it doesn't really help in a deep way with ""life issues"". It's a fun book - nothing wrong with that, as long as you realise that is what you're buying. Don't buy it to get information or, indeed, a re-orientation on life."
2,you get what you pay for,"When I got this item, the clasp on the pearl seemed like it was going to open and the pearl fall off. the chain seemed very flimsy. It took my about 10 minutes just to untagle the chain. The pearl itself was nice and that is why i gave it 2 stars not 1. I returned it cuz it wasnt worth it."
4,Memories refreshed,I listened and was again enchanted by Kiri's voice. She would have been the Anna Netrebko of her time. I did experience her in 2 live concerts and have vivid memories how beautiful she looked matching her singing.
4,Wonderful,I bought this machine and I love making these! They are easy to make. Follow the directions and presto you are an expert! My family can't eat them fast enough when I make them!
1,TOO HOT TO HANDLE,"iron is extremely hot on outside, requiring extra caution with use. batter sticks to iron even after coating .pizzelles are way too thick."
1,No way,"Not worth it. I had the old pizzelle machine for over a decade. Even using the recipe that came with it or the old one, the taste and cooking degree is horrible. I'd like to send it back. I even kept the box because I am so disappointed. I used to make them for parties and none would be left. Now some are left over and the main complaint is the cooking/taste/texture."
1,Buyer Beware,"Please do not waste your money on this. I had an old pizzelle maker that was my mothers (over 50 years old) and I or my mother never once had a problem with it. I thought that I would like to get a coated one (easier to clean) so I ordered the Cuisinart. Keep in mind that I only make pizzelles on holidays and during the second year, the latch broke off (which is plastic and should not be). Since I had a 3 year warranty, my husband called them. They said that we would have to pay $10 for them to send us a new one and another $10 to send the old one back. We were furious! Then I called another rep there and she waived the first $10 fee, but we still had to pay to send the broken one back. I will never again buy anything from Cuisinart. If you want a pizzelle maker, make sure that it has a metal latch, not a cheap plastic one."
1,Very disappointed,"This press must have been defective. It took much longer to make a pizzelle than was suggested, then it very inconsistent in the amount of time it took for each one. They always stuck, even with cooking spray and extra oil added to batter. The little measuring device was too small to get a full sized pizzelle.Now I don't know what brand to buy. Very frustrating and disappointing experience."
3,Small but efficient,Easy to use and easy to clean. Pizzelle's come out a little on the smaller side but still taste great and they're nice and thin. There are other pizzelle makers that offer a better finished cookie. I would have preferred them to this one. These are to small.
5,Easy to use and the price is right!,"Having had two other Pizzelle makers, and wearing them out, I found this press to be easy to use. I have more Pizzelle's turn out beautifully without sticking than I did with my other presses. My neighbors and friends LOVE my Pizzelle's; this is something new to them. I recommend the Cuisinart for ease of use and price.I like the recipe in the booklet too, it is easy and tasty."
4,Makes good pizzelles,This pizzelle maker is light years better than my 1940's model which had no heat regulator and was not non-stick. I still use a spritz of canola about every third batch and the pizzelle's are perfect.
4,Works great,"Love the new pizzelle press. Works great and produces great cookies. The only down side is the locking device. This seems somewhat cheap and prone to breakage, otherwise it is fine."
4,Pizzelle Press,"I was impressed when I saw it on The Chewshow and searched online for it; so far,I have made two ""batches"" and find itquite satisfactory."
4,Pizzelle Iron,"I really like the iron, the cookies are smaller than I expected, but it cooks great and I am glad I bought it."
5,Great!,The pizelle maker I bought has been awesome this Christmas season. I've made like 7-8 runs of them. Pizelles are tasty and good. I'll always enjoy my pizelle maker.
3,Pizzelle Press,Worked well in making pizzelle's this holiday season. I like my pizzelle's thin and these were okay but still too thick. I didn't like having to figure out when the red light was on and then the green and then waiting for the red light again. Somewhat confusing when you're trying to get done.
5,love it,works great and I will love it more when I get all the recipes that my family loves. Can't wait to make ice cream cones
1,BLEW UP,THE VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT SPARKS CAME FROM THE BACK OF IT AND THE BOTTOM PLATE STOPPED WORKING.
2,"Great cookies, poor latch closer","Just purchased item and after making the 3rd batch of cookies (made 4 days after 1st batch), latch on maker melted and broke. Very surprised by returns and comments that Cuisinart did not correct this problem. If it wasnt for this problem, item would of received 5 stars. Cookies were great and I did return the item. Will purchase better made machine and will ""listen"" to the reviews next time."
3,Not the best.....,"Despite following the instructions to a tee, and the recipe as well, the pizzelles stick!!! The first few come out flawless, and then...even with re-oiling between batches, I can not get them off in one piece. I would recommend this product, but only if you have a lot of patience and time."
5,CUISINART WM-PIZZELLE PRESS,"I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE CUISINART PIZZELLE PRESS. I AM MAKING THESE COOKIES FOR A WEDDING. ALSO, MADE A BATCH OF THEM FOR MYSELF, AND FAMILY.CONSIDER PURCHASING THIS ITEM FOR YOURSELF. LOVE IT, LOVE IT."
3,pizzelle press,"The press didn't always show the red light when starting nd green when pizzelle were done. In fact, the green light stayed on most of the time, so I had to check all the time to see if pizzelle were done."
5,Love it ...,"You can always trust the ""Cuisinart"" name. This product is excellant. Works easy and cleans up nicely for storage. Would always recommend the ""Cuisinart"" name."
4,minor problem with pizzelle maker,after two uses the latch on front of iron broke would appreciate a replacement latch .Please send responce small problem but like replaced thank you .Cheryl Hostetler address 8 Harmons Lane Rehoboth Beach Delaware. 19971
1,Not so good.,I did not care for the Cuisinart Pizzelle press. The cookies came out too small & too thick.
5,Great Purchase,"Very,very happy with this purchase. We have used it almost daily since receiving it. I have grilled not only sandwichs but fish, boneless chicken breasts. asparagus etc. As long as they are cut to a uniform height this works well.Order it and you will be happy."
1,Horrible cookies!,"When I mixed up my first batch of pizzelles I used the recipe in the booklet provided. They were horrible, not thin at all, very cakey. So I went to my tried and true recipe that I got from Mama Leone herself and I had used this recipe with her iron many many times for super thin crispy pizzelles. Not with this iron, they also came out thick. They are also smaller than what I am used to. Very disappointing and I am returning the iron. This may have something to do with the thickeness of the cookie but the latch can be hard to pop up when the cookie is done, very flimsy and I can see this breaking down the road."
2,Mine melted,"Yes, melted. The clasp that closes it melted and I felt it was no longer safe to use. I wasn't using it an insane amount either. Cuisinart said they would consider replacing or fixing it but I had to pay shipping both ways. The shipping would have cost more than the cost of the machine! I was not impressed. I am looking for a new one but definitely not one by Cuisinart."
1,Used Twice and Quit,"This appliance was a disappointment. I used it last Christmas and got it out to use yesterday. Made six pizzelles and refused to heat up after that. Tried recycling it eight times--no luck. Buy a real pizzelle maker and don't waste your time and money on this ""made in China"" version!"
4,Good results,"Bought this for our daughter last holiday. She loves Pizzells. This unit does exactly as advertised. We have enjoyed quite a number of the delicious Pizzelles, always very tasty! Good job on this product."
4,Cuisinart WM-PZ2 Pizzelle Press,I have used this twice so far and it works very well. The Anise recipe that is included was really yummy. Everyone loved them! I can't wait until I try some of the other recipes!
5,Cuisinart WM-PZ2 Pizzelle Press,I have had the Cuisinart Pizzelle Press for about 9 months. It has been Great until this morning when the latch broke off. HELP!!!! I need a replacement latch. Really messes up my Easter Cookies. It looks like it is easy enough to replace. MFG CODE WP91026 Bought it new from Amazon.com
4,Pizzelle Press Review,"I gave the pizzelle press to my daughter as a gift, to replace one (different brand) that she had used for years. She says that it is very satisfactory, her only negative comment was that the edges on these cookies is smooth, whereas the one she had used before made scolloped edges which she liked a little better."
5,cuisinart pizzelle press,"This is a wonderful product so far. Made the best pizzelles with it, crispy but with some texture to them."
5,Pizzelle Iron,"This was to replace my other iron, love the fact that you can get 3 done in the time it still takes for only 1."
4,Works Great!!,"This works great. I used it on setting #2. When you shut the lid it takes a while for the light to turn from green to red, but when it does it soon turns back to green to signal they are done, and they come out perfect then. For the price, I am really happy with it.It is slow though, it took me almost 2 hours to make 10 dozen. I am thinking about buying another one to cut my time in half."
5,Very Good,The Cuisinart Pizzlle Press was a great buy. It heats up quickly and is very easy to use. The pizzelle's came out very nice.
3,makes delicious pizzelles,"makes delicious and pretty pizzells, but only makes 2 at a time. it took a long time to make a whole batch. I would recommend one that makes at least 4 at a time. but it is a good working machine. and the pizzells it makes are prettier than my friends pizzells."
4,Quick and easy,"I just tried my new Cuisinart Pizzelle Maker and it was very easy to use. I followed the directions exactly except I didn't brush the grills with oil or anything before I used it and it was great! Nothing sticks. It was kind of hard to judge in the beginning just how much batter to put on the grills but you'll bet the hang of it real quick. I love the small size of this little maker and how quickly it makes the cookies. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm not very happy with how cheaply they made the latch to close the lid. I was extra cautious when using it because I read another viewer who complained that it broke right off. I can see this happening if you're not extremely careful. Otherwise, I can't wait to try some of the other recipes."
4,LOVED IT!!,"I had been using my grandmother's pizzelle maker. I always burned myself trying to get the pizzelle off b/c they always stuck even though it was ""seasoned"". I also never knew for sure when the pizzelle were cooked thusly ruining some when I opened it too early or too late. This one heats up quick, has the indicator lights, and is wonderfully teflon coated! It was a breeze making pizzelle cannoli shells with it. The only beef I have with it is the ridiculous little spoon that came with it. That spoon is no good! I just used a regular teaspoon."
2,Not as it seems....,"Please be careful when you order this. It is not as it seems. It makes SMALL pizzelle's not the two large that you would expect. It is VERY poorly made, and I do not expect this one to last. I purchased this to replace my old one that was my mothers. It was 25 years old and finnaly gave out, after millions of cookies were made. This one barely closes. If I did not need it for this week, I would have returned it. I should learn, you get what you pay for."
4,Love my pizeele maker,"I love this machine, but my handle on it did break, which is kind of a bummer."
5,cuisinart pizzelle iron,"I recieved on Novermber 18, 2009. I used on Friday novermber 20, 2009. It works great. The pizzelles did not stick at all on the iron at all. I love it."
3,A good gift,"This ""cookie maker"" was given as a gift to a lady who likes to ""cook fancy things"" and ""has everything""! She says that she likes it."
2,fear,fear ... I have nothing to add ... but you will find many other better products for sure ... just search before you chose this one
1,I only wish I knew!,"I'll bet this is a a dandy pizzelle maker but I can't say for sure since we have yet to see it--I gave it one star ONLY because the program insisted I do something in that space. I've ordered it twice but DHL can't seem to figure out how to get it there. (and yes, I've double and triple checked the address...)"
1,Maybe I just got a bad one. . .,But mine quit heating the fourth time I used it and now I have to hunt down a place that will repair Cuisinart - $40 is too much to pay to toss it out. I'm very disappointed.
2,Good pizzelles - lousy service,My wife bought this last year. The latch broke this year. They can't send me just a latch (about a 10 cent part) since it's made in China. They have to send me a whole new machine. They want $10 to send me the new unit and I pay for sending the old unit back. NOT! After I blew they waived the $10 and I can send the old unit however I want. Buy a product that you can get parts for. Not this one.
5,love it,A 2 year old could make perfect pizzelles with this its so easy!I would advise all my friends to get this brand.
3,Pizzelle Press Cuisinart,"Pizzelles stick to top when done. I went by the instructions,but had to clean each time.It is not non-stick (top). I brushed finally with crisco to no avail & tried that andfinally recleaned it ---- still sticks????? Creates too much work! I'm shocked.I purchased from Amazon"
5,Love it!!,"Red/green light not useful. I set the temp between 3 and 4 with preheat about 15 minutes with the lid latched closed. Also use kitchen timer approx 50 seconds. I like pizzelles just shy of brown color. If brown, shorten the time 5 seconds while eating the ""rejects"". Fun."
3,Would of been nice to know,"The description said "" New, perfect condition"" it had the best condition description but when I received the discs they all had the name "" Matt"" written on them in permanent marker! I bought them to replace one that I broke that didn't belong to me...not cool!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!,"This is a set that compiles the first two X-Men movies into one set but do not buy this product.This isn't the kind of box set that holds the DVDs in their regular DVD cases in one larger box set. Instead, this collection just has them in folder-like packaging and the discs themselves slide around when you pick up the packaging to take a disc out or put it back in and the DVDs get badly damaged this way. I had to replace the second movie because of this.Do not buy this product! Just get the two movies individually, even if you end up spending a few more dollars."
4,Excellent Movies So-so Extras,"I love both the X-Men movies, especially X2 and was eager to get them together in this nice looking package. I was not disapointed in the films themselves. They look and sound great. I found the extras, however, to be a little lacking. There were some interviews done during the shooting of X2 but nothing especially produced for X-Men 1 and so nothing from actors who didn't appear in the sequel. Most of the features were originally produced as marketing material or for the general TV audience and there is relatively little for the hard-core fan. I didn't come away with an overall sense of what it was like to make the films just some interesting anecdotes. I really wanted more behind the scenes footage and comentary. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed what there was but it left me wishing for more."
5,Good Collection,"Comes with special features and behind-the-scene footage on how the films were made. X-men 1 is good start for the franchise, but X-Men 2 is just awesome. Especially since Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) kicks ass throughout the entire movie, simply because his fight with the guards when they storm the mansion and his fight with Lady Deathstrike. Get this it is at a very good price, it reminded me why I liked the first two X-Men movies and disliked the third one."
3,BUYER BEWARE!,"The movies themselves are great. The problem is the packaging. It's not the regular disc holders. They are like CDs, when you fold up the Set, they get loose and slide around. I had to return it once because Disc 1 and Disc 4 were scratched very badly. I suggest paying the extra 8 bucks to get individual cases or buy two seperate DVD cases to hold them."
5,X-Men Rock!,"The 2 X-Men movies were probably the best movies I've ever seen. They really got me hooked on the X-Men comics and I really wanted to find out as much info as I could on the X-Men. They really picked out the best actors to do the parts and Bryan Singer, the director, really out did himself. I give this movie 2 thumbs up! The must see movie of your entire life!"
1,ROBERTO YANES CDS,I CANN'T RATE IT. THERE IS NO OPTION SO SEE THE SONGS THAT ARE IN ROBERTO YANES' CDS. GREAT MISTAKE FROM YOU PEOPLE
4,Excellent buy..,If you are thinking about a pressure washer this one is great.. Easy to use and move around.. Good pressure.. I would buy another.. One thing that does bug me.. I don't really like the siphon feed for adding detergent etc.. That could have been done better but I have used it many times without it and I think this pressure washer is fine..
4,It worked ALL summer in Hot Dallas!,"The only reason I give this a 4 & not a 5 is the previous review which I just read ... gotta do some research there... We used these on our two small dogs ALL summer and they were FLEA-LESS! We had no critters in our home or yard, either & that was NOT the case when using Frontline! And the dogs really like their morning 'treats' ... we yse this with nzymes antioxident & they're both really healthy ... they're white, so we add Angel Eyes for no black tear streaks ~ works for us!"
3,Moderate,"It is acceptable, but wasn't what I wanted because it is very weak in the graphics and stories are not as I expected."
4,Before there was Marlowe,"This book collects a few of Chandler's short stories, along with the essay ""The Simple Art of Murder."" The essay reads well, and gives a simple, clear statement of what Chandler dislikes about the murder mystery genre. By way of example, the book offers three stories that make the points, by one of the founding authors of the noir detective story.Although I enjoy the Philip Marlowe novels, these are short stories, they star different characters (none of whom are Marlowe), and generally seem weaker than Chandler's novels. The style is all there. The first story feature people guzzling alochol like a biofueled Hummer; characters throughout seem like people that could only exist at night. Still, even when Chandler isn't at his best, he's a lot better than most others.-- wiredweirdPS: All of the stories that appear here, and more, also appear in the collection titled ""The Simple Art of Murder."""
2,Not what I wanted,"I couldn't identify with either of the main characters, and the time shifts were maddening. Just as I adjusted to switching from present day to the 50s, the author would make another leap into the World Was II era. The way the two story lines were linked in the end was too contrived. The only reason I even finished the book was that it was all I had to read on an airplane trip. Buchan's other books are far superior. Mavis Cheek's are even better."
2,Too slow,"This was a pick by my book club, and it seemed to drag on for me. The reviews of our club were mixed--a few gals really liked it, but most thought the pace was too slow--not enough interest or excitement to carry the two story lines in this book."
2,Poor quality and the cord is too short,"Beware of the quality of this product. It broke within 2 minutes after I used it. It didn't even boil the water once! Besides, the electric cord is way too short. It has to be placed very closed to the outlet."
2,I don't see the big deal,"I don't see the big deal in these vitamins. I took them for like a week and I saw no changes in how I felt or my body whatsoever, seriously."
2,ugh.,"Wow, do I disagree with them being easy to clean!!! A great size for the overall bib, but gigantic neck hole for little babies. they sure look cool though."
3,Sadly not the same as the original,"About a year ago I purchased a bib made by Built. It was turquoise -- I think it came in pink as well -- and I have used it almost every day since we started my son on solids a few months ago. It was great for a number of reasons: small enough to not distract him from eating; not made of a material that made him want to play with the bib instead of eating; easily hand-washable; and it dried quickly. Anyway, last week I ordered this Built bib, thinking it was the same bib in a new color. The fabric has been changed from the original neoprene to something rougher that is trickier to wash and dry. Built -- please bring back the old version!"
3,still looking for the perfect bib,"These bibs are cute, and have a nice design, but they are too small for even my 1 year old (way too short). I have a blue/green and a black/green bib - and they get so fuzzy when washed (I wash them in loads with towels, so maybe I should change that?) I think that the best features about these bibs is that they do not allow food/drink to soak through and the bottom ""lip"" for catching food. Overall, if the bib was longer it would work better, at least for my son."
4,Skeptical at first but now a believer,So who would have thought that this bib would be such a great buy. I though the pouch would be more like a gimmick but boy was I wrong. This has to be one of the best baby bibs that I have bought. I really wish it came in more colors as I would have purchased a rainbow of colors. This bib is much more comfortable than the plastic ones you find around and if I had to knock it for something I would for the velcro. I am just not a fan of velcro on anything that has to go in the wash machine.
1,Do not waste your money,"I purchased this bib for my 5 month old daughter because I wanted a solid neutral colored bib that would go with some of her outfits that have black and green in them. However, I was very disappointed with my purchase. It is very uncomfortable on my baby to wear. The material is so thick and it is not very flexible at all. I would not purchase this item or recommend it."
5,The ultimate concert of Phil Collins,"One of the best concerts of Phil Collins. Great sound, very good performance, incredible fans in a unbelievable athmosphere. The main artist and his musicians are in best form during this event. A must have for every fan, because this DVD box has many scarce bonus material too."
3,Adequate cloth book for young baby,This cloth book has some cute illustrations but I was disappointed that the pictures weren't labeled in any way and that there was no story line to tie them together. Well constructed and washed well.
5,I have the whole collection,"of this nine books...THEY ARE MAGNIFICENT!!!As dad says: ""I strongly reccomend it, guys !"""
4,Grab a fire extinguisher!,"Wow! Kevin Yarbrough's debut novel is sure to scare with fiery flare. In 'The Fire Within', Kevin brings the legendary Phoenix to life with his original writing style and a blazing mix of sex, gore, twists and turns. This book is a not-to-miss.~ Stephanie S. WoodsAuthor of I.M. Internet Message and reviewer forMidwest Book Review"
5,Just what I needed.,"This book was given to my family when we lost our son in a car accident, by Florida State University. He was a freshman there. One verse talked about behaving just as though he was still with us, to continue to tell stories and use his name often. It ends with a promise that he is just around the corner and we will be reunited one day. At the time, it felt as though he was speaking to us through this passage. I now give it to any friends and relatives who have lost loved ones."
2,xam,The test questions were very elementary although the content was very helpful. The book did include graphical errors.
2,junk,they are just cheap plastic. they come with worthless screws to. i broke two of the screws putting the together around the capacitor. they fit around it just fine and were flush before i tried to put any screws in. i had to get some different screws and drill one of the holes out a bit to make it work.
4,cheaply built,"Firstly, this only comes with 4 screws, screws to attach this to your car are not included.Secondly, it is incredibly difficult to screw the top and bottom together. The holes are not drilled out well enough and the plastic is incredibly stiff and brittle. I cracked my top piece by over tightening. I couldn't even get a couple of them in all the way, even with a power drill.This being said. It was cheap, it fits, and it will do better than only having one mount and having my capacitor sliding around."
5,The Orginal James Blish Adaptations!,"For those of you that love the classic series; this set of books are the written word version of each episode. Why read the written versions? Well, James Blish provides lots of insight as to what is going through the minds of Kirk, Spock and McCoy along with the orginal crew. In the episode the Alterative Factor James Blish provides a better ending than the questionable one on TV. The novels provide a lot more facts on the crew and background details never metioned in the series."
5,Good little keyboad for lap use,"I got this so I could use it in my lap and surf from a comfy chair (with my monitor on an Ergotron arm). The touchpad takes a little getting used to if you're usually a mouse user (no scroll wheel, which I kinda miss), but I've gotten the hang of it. Makes it easy to get away from a desk and use a computer in comfort. I like it."
3,"An Interesting ""Angry Black Man"" Novel","This novel follows Steve Hill, an educated black man, through his struggles to find a place in white America without compromising too much of himself. Although not as well developed as some of Williams' later works, there are interesting themes of interracial relationships and Steve's inner conflicts. I recommend the book as a way to develop a better understanding of Williams as a writer. If you want his best stuff, stick to The Man Who Cried I Am."
3,hard to clean,I must say we do love our coffee maker but it has so many parts to clean it gets kinda annoying and the fact that at 5 am it is kinda loud too........the only other problem i have is finding filters for the coffee maker ...Has anyone found them i tried the website but had no luck......i give this coffee maker 3 stars because the coffee taste greast but with no dishwasher or if you wake up early with children sleeping it could be a disaster....
1,A piece of junk!,"Believe the bad reviews. In addition to being difficult to clean, the front door has popped open on several occasions while it was brewing. This caused a HUGE MESS all over my counter and floor, consisting of wet coffee grinds and hot water. Very frustrating. BUY SOMEONE ELSE'S COFFEEMAKER!!"
3,They just don't last very long...,"It makes excellent coffee if you use Eight O'clock Columbian roast coffee and brew a full pot every time. BUT...it's he!! to clean, and, if you wash it in the dishwasher, the plastic dries out and cracks. Even if you DON'T wash it in the dishwasher, the plastic breaks--little pieces. SO, too bad it's not made better. It's LOUD, but if you set it to brew coffee in the morning, it's kind of like an alarm clock!"
2,Stupid design,"As already noted, you have to clean up the grinder after every pot of coffee. Why? Because steam is allowed into the grinder area during brewing and it becomes totally sopping wet. If you try to take the grinder out before this happens, then the coffee maker stops and beeps at you; some sort safety feature? Really dumb. I'm going to try to rewire the damn thing so the grinder can be removed as soon as it's done grinding, by jumpering out the interlock switch."
3,choose another grind and brew,"We own 3 grind and brews and this is by far our least favorite. It is so much harder clean than the others (both Melita's). It has so much build up inside (which we can't get to) that is feels like gravel every time you open the filter basket. We brought the Cuisenart to the lake so we didn't have to use it as miuch. I would recommend the Melita grind and brew as it is less expensive, easier to clean and makes better coffee."
1,Design Flaw - 300 model better,"My main problem with this product is that after about a little less than a year, no matter how often you wash it, some of the ground up coffee somehow works its way into the sliding mechanism that lets you take out the filter. The result is having to pry the thing open careflully each time to try to get the filter out, and because it is flimsily made, you are very likely to break something in the process. We even completely cleaned out the ""coffee sludge"" from out of the sliding mechinism so it slid freely again only to have it stick on the very next brew.Do yourself a favor and purchase the DGB-300 model. The design is much better. There is no gap between the grinder part and the filter because it is one piece. Much better. We were very happy with the 300 model."
1,Worst coffee maker ever to CLEAN almost impossible,This is worst coffee maker I ever saw to clean CAN Not take apart to clean. Have to use a long handle brush and than almost impossible to clean and rinse.I have to unplug and wash with soappy water and than rinse (a nightmare). Would never buy one like this again not for this amount of money.
1,not hot enough---grind and brew,"Grind and Brew maker, very disappointing! Coffee NEVER hot enough. Too many grounds lost in sink drain during clean up. Cleaning up this pot is tedious.Too many parts."
2,A cheap product under a quality name,"This coffee maker would not command the price if it were not marketed under the Cuisinart name. I would not buy it again.Several design flaws:- No temperature control on the warming plate. The coffee cooks after a fairly short preriod.- no sight glass to judge water in the brew chamber. One must look over the top of the device into a dark chamber to see water level, which is not easy if you are under six foot tall.- Maker is too tall to fit under normal cupoards. It is noisy as well.Beside the design flaws, it is cheaply made. Light weight plastic parts and poor tolerance control make me feel it is not a long-lasting appliance.It does make a decent cup of coffee, and it is fun to grind whole beans and brew in one step. Too bad Cuisinart has chosen to market a product unworthy of the name."
1,"Horrible coffee, annoying to clean","For this much money, one has a right to expect a decent cup of coffee. Unfortunately, because of a woefully inadequate grinding operation, what you get is a tepid, transparent, undrinkable cup of plastic-flavored water. If that is what you are looking for, then this ""coffee maker"" is for you. But beware, if you should actually want another pot, you will have to disassemble, wash, DRY, and reassemble - get this - 8 parts before you can use it again.Forget it. This is a complete waste of money at any price."
1,Cleaning nightmare,"A normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse; this machine requires a wash, rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit. You can't just rinse the grinding unit because the fine coffee grounds need to be washed out.If it wasn't for the fact that we spent nearly $100 for this unit, I would throw it away.SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY IT"
1,Electrical Problems - pain to clean,"I enjoy this coffee-maker but didn't realize how much trouble it is to clean it. You've got to clean out the coffee-grinder, gold filter, filter top, filter container, and caraffee after each brew of cofee. The idea of freshly ground, freshly brewed coffee is nice but I don't think it makes the coffee taste that much better.The worst part about this is that it keeps breaking. We've alrady sent it back a few times and it keeps shorting out. It will smoke, overheat, and stop working. Cuisinart makes you pay for shipping both ways.I recommend getting something else."
1,What a mess!!!,"I got this to replace my older version of the grind and brew. I got the white one, and you can really see the mess. Coffee gunk drips from the grinding spout down behind the carafe down to the burner. And while the design of this one is easier to clean, it is still a drag every day. I would rather have a separate grinder and just a coffee maker than this mess!!"
1,ULTIMATE DISAPPOINTMENT !,"After three mornings of inferior coffee, I will be boxing up my new purchase and returning it. The coffee is weak. I have increased the amount of beans and that has helped only slightly. I love hot coffee (nickname....asbestos mouth) but the coffee remaining in the glass carafe becomes so hot, as to be scalding. If you pre-program to have coffee ready when you get up in the morning you will not need an alarm clock! The grinder is so loud that it woke us with a start and sent the cat running. I agree with the other reviewers who did not like the mess in the grinder (damp grounds)and the many parts to be washed and dried. Modern technology should make our mornings easier. I thought this was the answer.......but it was the ULTIMATE DISAPPOINTMENT."
1,I LOATHE this machine,"I had owned the old Grind & Brew (twice!), and my husband thought the new one might be better (we both didn't like the cleaning). This one is EVEN WORSE. I completely agree with the other reviewers that it's a true SOB to clean...and the coffee isn't good enough to justify the time spent doing so. A maid in my own kitchen, indeed! For the $$ they charge for this piece of junk, Cuisinart really should do some SERIOUS R&D on how to make a Grind & Brew machine that can be dismantled to clean all the crap that gets stuck on the little shelf below and behind the brew basket, not to mention the toxic-looking waste that gums up beneath the grinder. Gimme my old Grind & Brew ANYDAY! But, I think I'm going to jump on the vacuum pot bandwagon - America's Test Kitchens said they were great, and that's enough for me!"
1,A Design Nightmare,"I have owned two of these things [I know, my fault, but I thought the first one was a fluke basied on Cuisinart's reutation]. The first one laste a year befre the grinder just quit working over night. I had to go 20 miles to their recommended repair people to fnd out thaat Cuisinart doesn't make parts for this, so it was landfill. Bought another because I liked the concept o 2-in-1. The ground coffee often doesn't make it into the basket. The grinder NEVER gets all of the coffee out, so I have to use extra. It has to be cleaned every other day to function at all (I don't have to do that with my regular grinder). And the button that lets you pull out the pot in the middle of brewing often sticks open and the coffee goeas all ovver the countertop. Never again! And I'm questioning ever buying any other Cuisinart product."
1,Terrible coffee,"After about 4 months, the coffee maker did not work correctly. Some days it works, some days it spits grinds all over the place, some days the filter door won't close. The pieces don't fit well together, thus sometimes it dribbles coffee all over the counter. Cleaning it properly is a chore. Avoid this Cuisinart and buy a Braun instead."
2,One major flaw,"This coffee maker is a great concept, but really poor design. As others have said, the major flaw is that the steam gets backed up into the grinder forming a sludge that is difficult to clean. And you can forget about making back to back pots of coffee unless you take it apart and clean the grinder chamber and filter basket each time. And then you have to COMPLETELY dry the grinder parts so that the beans won't get wet when grinding.The coffee does taste good, but there is no choice for grinder setting and I like a course ground. The caraffe on the glass model is great. It's big and does not drip. The coffee temperature is also good, nice and hot and I like the 1-4 cup feature to make it extra hot. Unfortunately I am returning the pot because it is not worth the extra time and effort for cleanup. I wanted something automatic to be time saving and this pot is the opposite."
2,"Can you say ""high maintenance""?","This seems like a wonderful idea. Program your coffeemaker to grind and brew, wake up to fresh coffee. What could be better? Not much (at least to me when I'm stumbling out of bed.)BUT...while I love the idea of this coffeemaker, the reality's a little different. It's a fussy, tempermental little machine. First of all, it's impossible to keep clean. I have the black model, and gooey coffee gunk disappears into the crevices. You can remove some, but not all of the parts -- so cleaning this sucker requires a strong will, cleverness and time.The other frustrating thing is that this coffee machine is incredibly sensitive. God forbid you don't place the filter in the EXACT right position -- you'll end up with grounds everywhere or hot coffee all over the counter."
4,"Good coffee pot, but...","I have owned this coffee pot for a few years now. Overall it is good. The biggest problem is that the grinding is so loud, that it will wake the dead. If you live in an apartment, condo or townhome, you probably do not want to get one of these. It will wake up your neighbor."
4,Satisfied customer,"I bought this coffee maker about 6 months ago in spite of reading the review about the difficulty of cleaning. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's no big deal. There are four pieces besides the carafe: the grinder basket, its lid, the brewing basket and its lid. To wash them, I rinse them in water and then every few times, throw them in the dishwasher. I got the same results when I soaked them for an hour in dishwasher detergent and water. As far as the recent review which mentions the electrical problems, I haven't seen anything like that. The only problem I have with the machine is that it is too tall to fit under my upper cabinets, so I have to move it when I want to use it."
5,a great coffeemaker for the price,"I read a lot of negative reviews about this coffeemaker before I bought it, but I bought it anyway. I'm glad I did - I love it! Sure, the grinder's loud, but what grinder isn't? It doesn't spray coffee grounds like others do, and it's pretty easy to clean...all you have to do is remove it and rinse with water. The 1-4 cup option makes the coffee hotter than any other pot I've had. It took awhile to get used to all the parts (I'm not too crazy about the design of the coffee filter/lid), but it was definitely worth the money to have the smell of fresh coffee fill the house every morning. Now I love deciding what blend of coffee I'm going to brew the next morning - it's become a ritual."
3,Disappointed in the Grind feature,"We purchased this pot over the ""basic"" Cuisinart model because of the Grind & Brew feature -- freshly ground coffee upon wake up? Great! One less item on our kitchen counter? Great!Unfortunately, the grind feature is a mess. Steam from the brewing rises through the grinding mechanism, leaving a mucky mess. If you want a second pot of coffee, you have to clean AND DRY the entire mechanism. At first, this seemed like a minor annoyance, but after about six months we ended up pulling out our old coffee grinder when we had company for a long weekend and brewed several pots back to back. Now the coffee grinder sits on the counter right next to the ""Grind"" & Brew.I still gave it three stars because it does make a good cup of coffee. However, if I had it to do over again, I would definitely buy the basic Cuisinart or another brand."
4,Cuisinart Grind and Brew,"Esthetically pleasing so it works well in the kitchen; it is easy to program and operate. It seems to anticipate your every need and provide an easy solution. The directions are coherent and in detailed English. I am just crazy about this product, and have used both the provided basket as well as disposable paper filters - both work well. The only down side I can name is the loud grinder -if you program it to go off before you are awake, it is startling. After a few mornings, you won't notice it, but the first morning, I thought there was a fire somewhere because of the high-pitched hum the grinder emitted -for less than a minute."
4,Outstanding product if you know how to clean it,"I have had this product for several years and have never been dissatisfied. People complain that it is hard to clean, I disagree. I rinse the guts of the machine and put them in the dishwasher, no problem... Once a month I take my kitchen hand sprayer with very hot water, hold the coffee maker upside down at an angle in the sink and gently spray all over inside the machine working the spring loaded mechanism that holds the grounds. After all these years I am ordering another and keeping the first one for parts..... In my opinion this is the finest grind and brew I have ever owned...."
3,"Started out great, but is now junk","I got this coffee maker about a year and a half ago and I really liked it at first. However, it is a huge pain to clean. Now, almost everything on it is broken.*The button that releases the basket doesn't work, so I have to pull it open*The plastic part on top of the grinder broke*The grinder will no longer come out of the coffee maker, so I have to dig the grounds out by handAnd of course it only has a one year warranty."
2,Great coffee.. for a few months,"I LOVED the coffee from this coffee maker so much that I didn't even mind the fuss involved with cleaning all those parts. I even brushed off my concerns when it started acting ""wonky"" a months after we got it. If it didn't run properly, I assumed I forgot to turn on the timer. If it stopped halfway through brewing I thought maybe I didn't fill it properly. I kept making excuses for the erratic behavior until it abandoned me about 16 months after our love affair began. After the initial feeing of mourning, anger set in. There is no way a coffee maker that cost this much should die so soon! (over $100 on sale in 2004!) NO MORE over priced gadgets that are all flash and no substance. I went back to the store and bought the Bunn coffee maker that has been faithfully brewing my morning coffee for over two years without a hitch - and cost about the same!"
1,Disappointed Coffee Lover,"Dear Cuisinart,Great Concept, Great Look but why can't this wonderful idea deliver DEEP, RICH, HOT, GREAT QUALITY coffee? It is amazing that you would put so much time and design ideas into a coffee maker without thinking about WHY YOUR CUSTOMER WOULD DECIDE TO BUY THIS UNIT: I grind high quality beans in order to enjoy a rich high quality cup of coffee at home. This coffeemaker delivers weak, warm but not hot coffee. Clean up is not as bad as most are saying and the grinder is not that loud, but we want great (not average) coffee from your coffee maker. Unfortunately, the Braun flavor select unit I used to own for years does not grind it's own beans, but I am returning the Cuisinart for the Braun today. (PS: You never answered my email or call regarding these issues.)"
2,Disappointing coffeemaker,"I received this coffemaker as a Christmas present last year, and the quality of the coffee is just disappointing. It seems weak and always has a burned smell/taste to it, even the first cup but especially after it's been in the pot for more than a few minutes. I've tried using more beans, less beans, ground coffee, filtered water, bottled water, tap water, wire filter, white paper filters, brown paper filters.....but I've never hit on a combination that give me a cup of coffee without the burned taste and smell.As for cleanup, it's not a big deal unless you're making multiple pots of coffee. Just pop the parts in the dishwasher. I've never had the filter door pop open while brewing as others have. The grinder is VERY noisy.Overall, it's just a disappointment for the money. Since I'm the only coffee drinker in the family, I'm thinking about a single serve machine like the Keurig."
1,horrible to clean,"This coffeemaker does make good-tasting coffee, but the box advertises that it is simple to clean. It is not. The basket doesn't come out all the way, so you have to try to reach a finger in there to clean behind it. Cuisinart denied false advertising, but it is false. Their own customer service people don't know how to clean it."
1,the epitome of bad design,"dude, i bought this thing at a kitchen specialty store mainly because it was on sale. ok, the red color was also rather enticing.anyway, it sucks. i wish to god i'd read everyone else's reviews before buying it. what's scary is that some people actually paid full price for this piece of junk.anyway, nothing i can say that hasn't been said before. this. machine. sucks."
4,Good Pot!,"1. This pot makes a really great cup of coffee! I use 1 level Cuisinart scoop (a very small-size scoop) of beans per 2 cups of water on the carafe's marking line. It makes a very economical, rich, and delicious cup of java, every time!2. Yes, the grinder sounds like a grinder, all right. It's a little louder than that of a separate grinder, but it only takes 15 seconds.3. Clean-up is a zip--5 minutes, total--to hand wash, rinse, and dry the carafe and lid, the 3 filter basket parts, and the 2 grinder parts. I think of it as a meditative ritual, not quite as historic as preparing Japanese tea, but equally rewarding, in the end. ;^)"
2,Rube Goldberg would of loved this coffee maker...,"But I hated it. Actually, ""Hated,"" is a little strong, as it did make a fine cup of coffee. ""Irritated,"" is probably a better word to describe my reaction. Making coffee is not that difficult, except for having to push some needless buttons to open the thing, but clean-up was a hassle. The grinder, (Two parts), and the brew basket, (Three parts), have to be completely clean and dry to make another pot. As coffee is about the only vice I have left, I drink a lot of coffee, and on weekends make multiple pots. After three days my irritation at the poor design led me to return it and get the model DCC-1200, which is essentially the same machine without the grinder."
1,NEVER THE SAME COFFEE TWICE!!,"I have to say that I bought this coffee pot with the idea that my coffee would be soooooo much better if I ground my own beans.....NOT TRUE!!! In fact, I can't make the same pot of coffee twice!!! I have been using the same beans every time and sometimes it is weak and other times it is strong!! The cleanup is not so bad, considering it grinds too, but the condensation from the hot water makes the coffee grinder a little messier than a separate grinder. I am ready to junk this one and buy a plain jane coffee maker and go back to my regular old grounds. It is too unpredictable and it's a little embarrassing when you have company....it looks like I don't know how to make a good cup of coffee. One last thing is that even though it is a 12 cup coffee maker, the amount of beans that you would need is more than fits in the grinder!!!"
1,What a mess!,"If you ever like to brew a pot after one is finished, don't buy this coffee maker! It is a complete mess to clean up. Each time I brew a pot I have to wash and thoroughly dry two pieces to the grinder, the carafe, and three pieces to the basket! How inconvenient is that? When the maker is brewing the coffee, moisture gets into the grinder, so you cannot simply ""clean it every once in a while"" as another reviewer commented. It has to be cleaned every time as it gets wet inside every time.Don't buy it - I'm returning for a refund and going back to a separate grinder and brewer!"
1,Grind and Blue,"The name Cuisinart says it all. The best, or so I thought until I purchased the Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee maker. What a disappointment. It first of all has virtually no programmable coffee making features except what time to start. The result is a tepid cup of tasteless coffee regardless of what quality or quantity of beans you use. Secondly it is a mess to clean up with THREE separate components to be cleaned after each use. It is no bargain at any price and certainly not a product I could recommend if you treasure a really good cup of fresh coffee in the morning. Sorry Cuisinart but this product is a bummer."
1,Don't buy it ...,"We've been looking for a grind & brew with timer forever and thought this was the answer...Unfortunately, water condensation causes the beans to become sticky and clog up the channel to the filter. In addition, the bean grinder is too small for the capacity making the coffee weak. Our coffee ... never tasted so bad...."
1,Not a good coffeemaker,"Did you know this coffee maker was manufactured 4 years ago, which as cuisinart has informed me they are no longer under warranty. It doesnt matter if you bought it 4 months ago as I did, and have problems, there is nothing they will do for you. And let me tell this I have contacted Cuisinart 4 times the first 2 months after I bought it, it has leaked water constantly out the bottom of the unit itself, they will do nothing, why because it was manufactured 4 years ago. I paid 100 for mine, the cheap 20 dollar makers, brew better coffee than this one, and last longer than 2 months. I gave it one star only because I had to."
2,Disappointed,"This coffeemaker has a decibel level which seems to approach SST-level. We have a one story ranch house with the bedroom on the other end of the house from the kitchen. When I used this product, it woke my wife up when it was grinding the coffee. This was replacing a Melitta Mill and Brew which did not wake my wife up.The other disappointment is the inability to adjust the coarseness of the grind. Thus, you need to vary the amount of coffee beans or water to adjust. This is not very efficient.The Melitta let you adjust the grind level.The Cuisinart is now on its way back to the seller."
5,Love this machine,My husband and I got this for our wedding but in our recent move we lost it. We bought the exact same one again because we love it soo much. It has everything you need and is easy to use for both whole beans and ground coffee.
4,good cup of coffee,longest lasting coffee maker we have had - just replaced first one as it was knocked off the counter while painting - no fault of it's own :-) Only drawback is the grinding chamber must be cleaned after every use so more up-keep required than other makers.
1,Coffee Sucks!!!,I bought one and was extremely dissatisifed with the flavor of the coffee. It was very weak and tasted bad.
1,The worst coffee maker ever,"After 3 months of use, the basket does not close properly. I take careful precaution to make sure the basket and caraffe are properly in place but three times I have woken up to coffee and grinds spilled out all over my kitchen counter and floor because sometime during the grinding session, the basket was wiggled loose and opened.Not only that, it is a mess to clean, as you have to take off about 6 parts and clean them extensively, especially the grinder (even when you don't use it, you have to clean it because it fills up with condensation).Never again will I buy a grinder/coffee maker. It's better to grind your own and just fill it with grounds. Trust me, it's not worth the dissappointment and frustration of waking up with a huge mess to clean and no coffee to drink."
2,Poor performer in the realm of flavor...& that's everything w/coffee eh?,"I know exactly why this unit gets consistent 3 star reviews...the water is rushed thru the filter basket too fast to leech the optimum flavor from the coffee grounds. I beta-tested/compared to my KRUPS unit, which allows the water to swim in the bean much longer. Temperature-wise the CUISINART DGB500 wins by 10 degrees, but that doesn't matter, the coffee still tasted like tea unless I put about 35% more bean than a regular coffee maker. Great idea, but using that much more bean over a long haul means you might as well head to McCoffee for the $1.70 cup of GOLD COAST every day. You'll spend a lot less time cleaning parts that way too! Face it, it's all about the flavor if you're a serious coffee drinker...this unit will only frustrate the serious java-lover's palette. Save your money."
2,complicated & difficult to clean,"Picked this up instead of the Melitta Grind & Brew. After two years our previous Melitta had pretty much fallen apart, so I was looking for something better assembled.The Cuisinart boasts easier cleaning and a 12 cup capacity. Both are, IMHO, not true. The machine has more parts than the Melitta, and gets dirty *inside* the machine as well. Brutal. Furthermore, while the caraffe can hold 12 cups, the grinding chamber can barely hold 6 heaping scoops of coffee. So, unless you like your coffee to look like tea, you *ain't* gettin' 12 cups of coffee out of this puppy.Finally, forget ever accurately measuring the water - the fill chamber is an ergonomic disaster.So, we're back to the Melitta Grind & Brew, and will stick with it for the foreseeable future."
4,Awesome once you figure it out,"This thing is really awesome. Once your figure out how to load it (cut bread, do not overstuff, etc.. which in my mind is trivial since there are NO standard bread sizes), the grilled sandwiches it turns out are delicious. Omeletes are ""ok"" if a tad dry on the outside though moist on the inside.Will not be using it for making omelets again!The only (or two) thing(s) that would have been useful is a temperature control know and/or a beep to let you know the grill time is ready. You have to hover around it to see the green light come on. If you step away for much longer after the green light turns on, be prepared for a burned sandwich!Would recommend this highly if you are not the type that wants 'everything' done for you."
5,Great pick,"Amazing price, does everything you want it to, quick, simple and easy to use! Love this! Bought another one a few weeks later for my sister before she moves into her new apartment."
2,Keep your packing materials--you may need to return it.,"I'm disappointed with this sandwich/omelet maker, which I began having problems with about the third time I used it. The green light comes on; I pour in my egg mixture to make little ""omelets""--and the light stays green, meaning that it isn't cooking. In order for the red light to come back on I have to unplug it for several minutes and try again. Usually takes a couple of tries just to get it to work. I would have returned it, but it's just too much hassle at this point."
1,Save your money,"Used it for about a month before it quit working, The indicator lights still came on but the unit would not heat up. Even when working, it was good for grilled cheese sandwiches and that's about all."
3,Sammich maker,"Seems to work fine and for the price it's a steal, easy to clean, the outer casing and plates get very hot so be careful, overall a good purchase"
2,You get what you pay for,"The thing works and does what it's supposed to do, but it is cheap looking and the plastic surface paint scraped on the first use."
1,Piece of XXXX,"We brought this item, thinking Cuisinart Brand product will be better constructed than others, but it seems it is not actually made by Cuisinart but by some Chinese manufactures and Cuisinart just put its label on top. Quality is useless and it last only 6 month. Wrong decision... useless product"
1,Complete Crap,"I purchased this item to replace the sandwich maker I left at an old apartment. I couldn't remember the old one I had but saw this and purchased it. I used it to make grilled cheese as I had done so with my previous one. Well, I ended up with grilled bread with cheese on the outside and all over my counter. The item was locked and I followed the instructions, the item was just poorly made. I wish I had the name of the other brand I formerly had because I never had any issues with it. Don't buy this one."
1,not what I thought,"This grill is very, very, very limited it what you can make with it. The grills are so small (4""x5"") that no bread of any kind will fit without trimming. I tried to make a grilled cheese sandwich and the bread was hardly browned and the cheese ozzed out. I will put it away in case I ever want to make grilled tea sandwichs!"
4,Great toaster,"I made a few sandwiches in my grill, and I am satisfied with this product. I don't think the pockets are shallow. I like to overstuff my sandwiches, and it always comes out good"
3,Fine if you like your bread squished,"Put a slice of cheese in between 2 slices of average typical grocery store white bread. Close the lid, heat it up, open the lid...voila, squished grilled cheese sandwich. Had they added a 1/4 inch more clearance, I would've given this 5 stars, as it otherwise works as advertised. But for some reason they didn't leave enough room when you close the lid..."
1,Some may like it,"This is probably a good product. But I didn't like it. Too messy, too small, leaks too much, too much trouble and to hard to clean. It spends it's life in a landfill somewhere. I make my hot sandwiches in the microwave."
1,Not a Reliable Product Watch Out!,"I purchased this recently and was happy to get one. My wife and i used it to make 2 sandwiches which turned out great and we were very pleased. However, a couple of days later we wanted to use this product for a second time and it would not heat up. The green light comes on which indicates it is heated and ready for use but it is not heated. Im very dissapointed in the reliability of this product. When it worked it worked the one time it worked beautifully. All im saying is be aware of the reliability issue when ordering online since you may be packing it back up and sending it back."
4,Works perfectly,"I love this little sandwich maker and use it daily! Okay, it'll grill sandwiches and toast them quickly but as others have noticed there are a few issues:1. Most bread is too big and will hang out the side. This isn't a big deal as you can just put it in the middle of the sandwich maker, and you won't get that picture perfect diagonal cut but then you can only make 1 sandwich at a time.2. If you want to make a sandwich with many toppings - cheese, meat, tomato, cucumber, etc. The lid won't close, and you'll have to hold it shut.Other than those two main issues it's a pretty great little machine. I accidentally once left it plugged in for 8 hours as I was rushing to get to school, came home to no fire and it still working perfectly, albeit the kitchen was very hot!"
1,Super Glue on Stickers,"This sandwich maker has a big sticker on top when you get it...can't use til you remove, and it is put on with Super Glue. You can't submerge unit in water, so I wet soapy sponge and left it on lable for 40 minutes. Still wouldn't release. Had too use a dull small canape knife to work on it....still wouldn't release without a lot of pressure. Now has stratches and big black gouge on top so you can't return, and there is still the glue residue all over top of unit (could only get the paper off...glue won't release with soap and water or finger nail polish remover). Cuisinart....Why ruin your product by not using a quick release lable....what's point of having it glued on permanently?????"
3,Not such a great gadget,"The product does exactly what it is billed to do: it grills sandwiches quickly. The problem is that the grill is very small, so normal grocery store bread is way too big and it hangs out the side. In addition, if you want to make a bigger sandwich, i.e., stacked with several ingredients, the lid will not close and lock without Herculean strength and the risk of burning yourself. It does OK with two small pieces of bread and a small amount of cheese. But, for that, it's just as easy to heat up a nonstick frying pan. It would be, however, handy for students in dorms or others with no access to a stove."
2,Too small for regular sandwiches,I bought this sandwich maker so my daughter would be able to make quick sandwiches without my assistance. The Grill works fine but I find that the plates are too small for regular slice bread. My daughter likes to make grilled cheese on this and she usually adds tomatoes and sometimes other ingredients as well. Since the plates are so small the bread hangs on the sides of the grill and if she uses more than one slice of cheese it melts all over the machine. Especially the back where its hard to get it clean. This would have been perfect if it had larger plates.
1,CUISINART,THIS ITEM LASTS ONLY MAX 6 MONTHS !!! I ALREADY BOUGHT FEW AND TODAY THE LAST ONE I PURCHASED DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. I AM VERY UPSET AND FED UP TO SPEND MONEY .
1,"Messy,Messy","Thought this would be good for my teenager to make grilled cheese sandwiches for herself but apparently 1 slice of cheese is too much, this overflowed everywhere and made a huge mess. What cheese remained was like molten lava and the bread was soggy by the time it cooled off enough to eat. Wish I would have looked at some of these reviews prior to buying this!"
4,I like this little gadget but it's a pain to clean,The very first time you use it it will burn your sandwich. Just know that. After that it does okay but even with spraying w/pam each time it is hard to get everything out of the little nooks. Best to get a Q-tip for the tight corners & get it all clean before storing. If you put any kind of meat in it the meat will cook until warm but pull out of the sandwich when you bite it so just use soft items (like cheese) or chop the meat/ingredient before cooking. Gives a nice toasty flavor though which I like so not a bad purchase for the price. The only downside is cleaning really.
4,Makes Quick Grilled Cheese Sandwiches,Easy to clean with water and cloth or paper towel. I have only made grilled cheese and toasted bread so far. Everything cooks to my family's liking.Easy to store and lightweight.
3,Good while it lasted,It was a decent sandwich grill but did not last long. We used it a lot and were happy with its performance. But it only lasted for 3 months.
2,Not like the original sandwich Snakmaster,"I had great hopes that this would replace my Snakmaster sandwich maker which was accidentally given away. It looks the same. But noooo! The wells for the meat filling are so deep that when the sandwich bread is put in the space, it falls over the center ridge spilling the contents out the sides. It toasts very unevenly (I should have paid attention to a previous review.) And worst of all, it only ""seals"" the sandwich in the middle instead of all sides. You end up with four triangle sandwiches sealed on one side only. My Snakmaster gave me a triangle pocket sandwich, sealed all the way around. I expected more from Cuisinart. Sigh....."
1,hard to use and clean,"I thought this would be a great substitute for grilling sandwiches on the stove, but there are two serious drawbacks: the grill is divided into sections which are smaller than any normal piece of bread, so you have to cut up the bread to fit ; cleaning it is a bear because there are so many ridges and hard-to-reach areas. It's much easier to clean a frying pan. We have used it twice since buying it and likely won't use it again."
4,Easy to use sandwich maker,Cuisinart sandwich maker is a useful tool in my kitchen. I like that it is easy to clean and use for a quick meal.
4,heats fast,This little gadget heats fast so you can make a real quick grilled cheese. I just wish the housing was made form a more substantial material. The plastic makes it feel like it won't be in my kitchen in 5 years.
3,Was my sandwich grill illegally parked?,"Nice versatile device that is a useful compliment to the product line, but as many reviewers noted, the large, pointless, and unsightly sticker on top of the unit is not a small problem. First, it serves no purpose, as there is no safety notice or some understandable reason why it would be there. If cosmetic, fine, then it should remove easily. BUT - no exaggeration - this sticker seems to be of the same variety as the ones they place on illegally parked cars (Note to Cuisinart: that is done to PUNISH the driver). It can only be removed with an unreasonable amount of effort. Sticker removal degree of difficulty rates as a 20 on a scale of one to ten. It says right on the sticker to remove it, and true, I suppose you don't have to. Except that it is one ugly sticker. An idiotic choice by Cuisinart, now immortalized by this review."
5,simple and easy,"Love the simplicity of this product...when it is heating up, this is when I put the sandwiches together...my favorite is cheese and avocado and some tomato sauce. Also love that you don't need to spray it with anything because the material is non-stick. Barely any mess...(unless you overload on cheese)...Loving my toasted sandwiches."
5,"Well made and simple to use, ideal for the hot sandwich enthusiast","I bought this kitchen gadget three years ago, and I am very happy with my purchase.I use it to make warm sandwiches of molten cheese, or cheese mixed with eggs. Very easy to operate and to clean. When the sandwich is ready, the light changes to green. You can also use it to cook eggs, or warm bread. I think it would make a very valuable addition to the kitchens of those who don't cook otherwise.I dropped it once and some of the plastic cover broke, but I glued it back and it is as good as new."
1,Non-stick coating comes off,"I've now gone through 2 of these in 18 months. The non-stick surface chips off easily and I did not use a metal utensil on it. It just seemed to rub off while I was cleaning. We got a few good months out of both of them, but for now I don't want to serve my children chipping teflon (or whatever it is) in their grilled cheese sandwiches. I'm sure I could send it back for another one from Cuisinart (which I did w/the first one) but I think I will try another brand."
1,Giant Stupid Irremovable Sticker!!!!!!,"I can't believe that so few people have mentioned the gigantic 'permanent' sticker on the top of the grill.This thing is stuck on with some serious glue and seems to withstand all attempts at removing it. Any further attempts will likely result in scratching the surface of the item, thereby voiding whatever warranty they may offer on the thing. (The conspiracy theorist in me wants me to believe that this is by design.)I'll be sending this item back as it's completely useless to me. I can't use it without removing the sticker, I can't remove the darn thing and I can't risk scratching the grill itself."
2,Designed By Marquis de Sade,"This is one of the most annoying and badly designed machines of its kind.It is this side of un-cleanable.An odd size, but quick to do what it should do. But it is the aftermath!!!Cleaning it takes more time than preparing and cooking. And in the end, the cleaning is always difficult and usually unsatisfactory because of the silly and thoughtless design which must be by someone who has: 1. never cooked, and 2. never cleaned.This should only be sold at S&M; sandwich shops."
4,Good Product,It's good. Worth of its value. Easy to use & saves lot of time also. We almost use it 3-4 times a week.
2,Don't waste your money if you want to use it for pita breads,"I'm very disappointed. I've purchased this machine to heat pita breads in it so that I can eat it, and unfortunately I've found that it is not suitable for this kind of bread. I have checked on the return option for this item, and I've found that there is no benefit if I return it because it will cost me about the half of its price. There was an option under the reason list that I used to see in the past but I can't find anymore. The option was ""different from what I was expected"" or so, and it was a great option because it explains my situation perfectly, but I don't know why I cannot find it anymore at Amazon.com. However, this is one of the times that I felt that I'm unlucky and not satisfied with my purchase at Amazon.com."
5,Works!,It makes good sandwiches. Use butter and the right size bread and you'll be happy. It's rare to find the great iron ones made to go over a cooktop so this is a good alternative.
4,Why did I wait so long to get this?,"I had a version of this in my dorm room, and we used it so much the handle broke off. I've been re-looking at these for a while, really trying to justify why I should buy a fancy panini version for way more money. I finally picked this up instead. There are so many things you can make in this thing. It's fast and easy to clean. I just discovered that you can crack an egg and cook it perfectly in one of the triangles and it comes out great. Only 4 stars because I really want it to have a ""floating hinge"" so I can fit more stuff in there :)"
2,Not Worth The Trouble or the Money,"I received this Cuisinart Sandwich Grill as a Christmas gift. Looks nice and I usually like Cuisinart products. Today we gave it a try with a grilled cheese and added some bacon and tomato. After reading the directions, two sandwiches were assembled and placed in the Sandwich Grill. Very soon we could hear sizzling noises and steam was coming out of the machine. When the indicator went to ""ready"", I tried to remove the sandwiches and this was accomplished with some difficulty. The toasted bread was dry and filling was much too hot. Cheese was oozing and this made for a messy meal. Cleaning up the Sandwich Grill was a pain.In summary, I could make the same sandwich on my stove top with a nonstick pan faster and with better results. And, clean up with a nonstick pan is always easy. Perhaps we'll give it another try, but I won't be in a hurry to use it again."
4,Quick easy sandwiches,"This is a great, easy sandwich maker. It warms up in only 3-4 minutes and grills in about five. I only give it four stars because I wish it had a buzzer or alarm to tell me when the light turns from red to green (indicating it's hot or done cooking), and it's a little tricky to clean. Other than that it's a great machine and perfect for a quick lunch."
5,Nice little machine for the price,"I have bought these before, usually from a local store. The thing about these types of machines is that the non stick gives out quickly and food starts sticking to it. Generally they are so cheap that I just toss them out and get a new one. So far, this Cuisinart one is holding up much better than it's competitors. We use this often and it's great for any kind of a grilled sandwich."
2,Doesn't work!,This product worked only for about 6 months for me!!I dont even know why it stopped working?? I hardly used it...I wont recommend it..
4,Great Product,"Read previous reviews and discovered most was possitive with clearly some reviews of people who are ill-informed as to requirements and or operating a snackwich, great product deal with regular bread made sandwiches with ground beef, Tamato and Chees, Ham and Cheese and Jelly and Cheese with out anny problems, and Yes you have to clean it after every use and yes you will have cheese dripping deal with it."
1,Back to The Drawing Board,"Needs rethinking.1. No on/off switch; pull and plug cord into outlet each use.2. Only one arbitrary temperature; overcooks often.3. Contents of sandwiches often spill over edges.4. Gives off smoke and odor like back of a turnpike diner.5. Must be scrubbed by hand almost immediately, else grease is baked permanently into the nonstick (sic) surface and cannot be removed by Lysol, Krud Kutter, kitchen sponge rough side, etc. Perhaps could be cleaned by chipping with a paint scraper--bye cooking surface.6. New unit could not be given away to Salvation Army, had to be discarded per #5."
4,Best sandwich grill I ever tried,"Being an older person, I was made my grilled sandwichs on the stove. This is much easier and much quicker. About 65 years ago, GE made a grill, that also had changeable plates for waffles. This was very nice, but no longer made. Thank you for bringing the sandwich grill back. It is so simple to use and cleanup. The sandwiches are great."
4,That's Penn and Tellar,I have read parts of the book and it gets a bit silly...but that's Penn and Tellar....I still liked many parts of it....great if you love to play practical jokes with a bit of magical whimsy...
1,Get your money back.,"If you bought this, get your money back. There are other more interesting books on magic. If you are a Penn & Teller fan and can handle hundreds of pages of pure boredom, buy this."
5,Good stuff!,"I just got my copy of ""How to Play in Traffic"" and was awake looooong into the night reading it (and often laughing outloud!). Apparently, judging from a couple of the reviews, some people thought this was supposed to be a book on performing magic tricks and were disappointed. But having read the other Penn&Teller books, I was very pleased to find the book was sooooo much more -- the hilarious anecdotes, the funny prose, the wonderful pictures. If you're in to P&T, this books is a pleaser! :-)"
3,Classic Essential Mexican Lit,"I read this book while in Mexico (which helps w/an authentic and cultural immersion). What I liked was the historical perspective of the Revolution, which I did not know much about, and also the appreciation of the time in which it was written. I was in in amored with the style which I found it very much to be a Don Quiote type of story. I pushed to get to the end and ultimately skipped to finish. This does not diminish the fact that it was a prolific novel of it's time and the appreciation for the message."
4,A Worthy Book,"Upon opening this book it is good to bear in mind that author Mariano Azuela, the so-called first of the ""novelists of the Revolution,"" was born in 1873. Consequently, the text is a little choppy but overall this is a worthy book.""The Underdogs,"" is a marvelous narrative of the Mexican Revolution. The protagonist is a poor farmer who rises to the rank of guerrilla general with bravery and an endless streak of luck. To that end, the book is a blow by blow account of the brutality of the revolution and the hardships the poor suffered from both sides.However, as the plot unfolds the author skillfully dismantles the lofty liberal idealism of how the revolution improved the quality of life for the masses. Ultimately, the book ends on a moralistic note...lamenting the length and fruitlessness of the conflict."
4,Scenes from a revolution,"This novel, although mostly a series of vignettes with only the slightet of plot and character development, never the less delivers a harrowing descripton of the Mexican Revolution."
1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"This book is the worst book I have ever read. This is the type of book where you can read the whole thing and when you get to the end you realize you have just been looking at the words without actually reading them. It is just impossible to follow. Not that the book is too complicated, but the writing style is just sloppy and terrible. This is due to the fact that it is translated from Spanish, but its definitely not worth reading, let alone buying."
4,Representative of its time.,The R&B/salsa hybrid known as boogaloo was extremely popular during the late 1960s and early '70s and most of the songs here reflect this. The inclusion of boogaloo-flavored tracks with traditional salsa numbers and slow tempo boleros make this album very interesting.
3,SPR00200 file folders 50/bx,"The only problem i have with this item is that you state in the description that there is 50/bx but, they only come with 40/bx. You might want to change that and lower the price."
4,Good educational value,I wanted to learn something about the mind as it pertains to business and personal life. Tracys book teaches us to focus on what's important and forget the the rest. I'm thinking of reading it again.
4,For the beginners,"Simple, clear and understandable.I'd recommend it to read to everybody in the beginning of their studies or carreer. Currently unemployed - also recommended, will help you to get yourself together and take more responsibility of your life.The rest - do not bother, there will not be any surprises for you."
5,Great job Brian,"My first contact with Brian Tracy was a at a seminar a friend of mine invited me too. It was great. Since that time I have committed to leraning all I can, because learning power equals earning power.Focal Point like all of Brain's other work has been not only educational, but inspiring. If you invest in and read one book this year. Make this the one.Good readingJason McClurewww.jasonmcclure.com"
1,Tracy's SLAM strategy is selfish,"Say I get married and afterwards my wife develops a debilitating disease. If I had known what I know now, I wouldn't have gotten married to her. Tracy's advice: dump her as fast as you can.Say I agree to help my friend move. When I arrive at his place I find out that he's a packrat and has tons of stuff to move. If I had known what I know now, I wouldn't have agreed to help him move. Tracy's advice: get out of your commitment to help as fast as you can.In both these cases, there is no regard for commitments you have made to other people."
5,Want Focus? Get this Book!,"By the end of Chapter 2 (42 pages), I had incorporated several of Brian Tracy's suggestions and won two large contracts for our company. Worth the price of the book - easy! Tracy claims he has a ""Proven System to Simplify Your Life"". It is true! As he says, ""Don't just read this book, incorporate it"". Are you ready to positively change your productivity, goals and life? Be prepared for happier days :)"
3,"For a book called Focal Point, it's a bit unfocused.","I thought I would get ""A proven system to simplify my life, double my productivity, and achieve all my goals"".But there was not such a system available in the book.What there was was a bunch of platitudes and anecdotes with a few good ideas thrown in for good measure. There was no discernible structure to this book, nor did I know what I should do once I finished the book... Brian Tracy is a great motivator, but he's not great at creating actionable content."
1,"Not Campy, Not Scary Just Stupid","While there were a few decent ""Jaws"" rip-off's (Joe Dante's ""Piranha"" for one), this is certainly not one of them. This film fails despite its Cast of American Film Royalty. I've read accounts of how late-in-life John Huston needed the money, that Shelley Winters took any role she was offered, and that Bo Hopkins was dying to be a leading man. But Henry Fonda, for God's sake, what was he thinking ? Probably the same thing that the Screenwriters were thinking - nothing. The premise of a giant octopus gone mad by an evil corporation's greed is as old as dirt but the conclusion of Shamu enjoying squid for supper was, to say the least, unique. This dud joins such other infamous 1970's ""Creature Features"" as ""Frogs,"" ""The Swarm,"" and ""Barracuda"" as cinematic chum that is best avoided."
2,Movie Review,"Both of these movies were made in the 1970's. The 'Ants' video has pretty good special effects and a decent story. 'Tentacles' is about the same. It is a good movie if you like ""B"" type movies, and if you don't spend too much money on them."
3,Hey buddy watches those Tentacoli,"There is no wrath like an octopus scorned. Take a lot of actors past their prime, add an octopus past its prime, toss in some bathing beauties worth eating, and a few brats on small sailboats for desert and you have a movie.You already know the story of the ruthless developer that does not mind a little sea food (for Mr. Tentacles) if it does not get in the way of the project. Self conscious ""do-goober"" that thinks eating people is not nice and a buddy going down for revenge.This leave us with the question does the innocent cephalopod get dispatched or does he live for a sequel?"
2,Almost Worth It for One Nightmarish Scene,"If you've read the other reviews, you already know how bad this ""movie"" is.The only really scary moment is when the sole survivor of a nighttime encounter with said monster aboard a yacht or cabin cruiser is twisted around & lifted into the air by the octopus, as if she were a trophy. This one scene is very disturbing / frightening.I don't know how they got the actress to do this incredibly creepy scene.That was one really pissed-off octopus!This one scene should have been saved for a ""real reel"" feature, and the rest should have been burned up forever."
2,"""Jaws"" with eight arms","Just as the hoopla of ""Jaws"" was dying down, we got ""Tentacles"". Great cast - Henry Fonda, Shelly Winters, Bo Hopkins, Claude Akins, and John Huston. A San Diego community is terrorized by a giant octopus, and it's passable fare for those who aren't too critical. Could have been much better, but the trouble is that most of the story (and most of the scenes) try to ape ""Jaws"", instead of trying to create a story of it's own. As a result I have a hard time trying to get into a movie that draws heavily on another one. I was a bit disappointed that Shelly Winters didn't have a heroic underwater scene like in ""The Poseidon Adventure."" That might have enlightened things a little."
2,"Bad, even by Drive In standards","I definitely have fonder memories of what was going on in my car at the drive-in than what was going on up on the movie screen. I believe my date's name was Jody and the movie (second on the bill) was TENTACLES.The only thing I remember were the puppet killer whales tearing a real octopus apart for the finale (a dead octopus, from what I've read--but this was a European film, right?).The only reason I'm writing a review for this movie--in the off-chance that you'll actually watch it--is to share some trivia: all of Henry Fonda's scenes were shot in his backyard. He agreed to do this piece of crap as long as they paid him and HE DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE HOME! Is that hilarious? He just walked out to his backyard, shot all his scenes on his own lawn furniture (most on a dummy phone, as I recall), and picked up a check.You're going to put more effort into watching this movie than Henry Fonda did APPEARING in it!"
3,Cinema classic material,"Growing up in a small town that NOBODY has ever heard of, we only had 1 theatre and 1 drive-in. Empire of the Ants, Tentacles and The Giant Spider were shown every summer for at least 8 years, as I remember it. In ""Empire"" I remember Joan Collins performing quite well. The giant ant costumes were obviously fakes, but for 70's technology, very well depicted. The film is rife with ""image lay overs."" Mentioning that I mean close-ups of ants (normal) that were magnified and poorly placed on the big screen. This is the same cinematography that can be expected in ""Food of the Gods."" Nevertheless...GREAT movies for the Gen-X crowd. Personally, I liked these films, but these are NOT for the overly-critical. ENJOY!!!"
3,um...,"Let me break this to you as gently as I can.Humans become ant-slaves by being forced to sniff the queen ant's farts.When I remember how scared I was as a kid watching this at the drive-in in 1975, I cringe.Don't know if the dvd works better as a ""so-bad-its-good"" flick, or a coffee coaster."
3,Something missing,"Sorry, I can't agree with the other reviewers. Maybe since they are new to Corel they didn't realize the fact that information on some very important tools is completely missing. Although shown in a toolbar description, the interactive drop shadow, blend, and distortion tools are forgotten. I'm also new to Corel, and I stumbled on this fact while experimenting. It does provide a good basis for a robust piece of software, but I can't give it 5 stars."
1,Feather,"Perhaps the book should have been titled, ""Chicken or Feathers"". A line the author uses quite often throughout the book. The author could have just reapeated the phrase over and over for a page or two solid. This ""novel"" reads like low quality soap opera crap. I'm gay, I'm male, and I'm a RN; I was expecting something more organic, true to life. This story so did not deliver. There were often typographical errors in the text which helped to contribute to the overall sophomoric effect of the writing. This book was a sweet waste of my time."
3,Ok read,Not real happy with the choppy read but over half way in I wanted to know what happened and finished it. Nice stories that does have laughable moments. I did not like how this book ended as I was waiting for more at that time. Just ok.
1,Disastrous - click to the next book option - NOW!,"I'll hand it to the cover designer for hoodwinking people into buying this utterly useless and predictably gay ""book."" The romance aspect - predictable, the gay aspect - predictable, the nursing aspect . . you get the picture. Terribly written and clearly used for this ""writer's"" ego boosting. He doesn't make it past page 20 when he HAS to mention the size of his penis - in the context of telling another syrupy ""had to have been there"" story, of course. Can it get any more gay than that? Why not just take an ad out on Craigslist and brag there? What gay man didn't have a ""fag hag"" in college? This alleged heartwarming and charmer of a book is a waste of paper and your eyesight. I'm embarrassed for this guy and anyone who writes that they liked it."
5,Are you ready for beautiful music?,"This album belongs in your collection of music you love to listen to when you want to be swept away by beautiful music. I would consider this the first ""Kathie Lee"" album because it is her first project where she had creative control over everything. It's as though she emerged from a watershed period of artistic introspection and finally tapped into her raw talent rahter than try to please the masses with comercial products. You'll know what I mean after you listen for the first time. It's a magnificent album. It's a unique album. If you try just one Kathie Lee album make it this one. After two recent albums I think she finally realized that she had to reach deeper to find the best of her talent. This album proves she has talent and cares about your experience when you listen to her music. You will love it. Take a chance and buy this album. I look forward to your reviews."
4,A good buy,This is a beautiful CD. My daughter enjoys it and it is so soothing that I have almost nodded off while listening to it!
4,"GOODNIGHT ANGEL"" PUTS THIS ADULT TO SLEEP AS WELL","...and I mean that in a good way!Self-penned by Kathie Lee Gifford and David Friedman, Kathie Lee's soothing voice, along with the piano and limited musical accompaniment, is perfect for lulling your little one to sleep. Among the stand-outs are the title song, ""Goodbye, Goodnight,"" ""Rockabye Lullaby,"" ""Hey Little Dreamboat,"" ""If You Can Imagine,"" Even though, ""Goodnight, Little Knight"" is a bit too upbeat for a lullaby (as another reviewer stated), Kathie Lee still does a beautiful job with it. ""Goodbye, Goodnight"" and its reprise act as bookends for this little gem. Highly recommended. 4 stars."
4,Peculiarly charming,"I love the cover of this book!! The rest of it is useful. The order of the arrow is a concise description of the struggles I have in my life. Occasionally I am down, most of the time I flat line, and sometimes I am heading upward to the next level.She does use some of the same stories from her previous book ""Love is a Verb"", but I won't hold it against her. It is a great read for a nice pick-me-up."
5,Anouther GREAT book from Rob Roy.,"If you wont to learn,live and love. Then this is for you. I have added this book to my Rob Roy collection and I am thankful for that!!!"
2,I am returning,"This is the first time I have to return something to Amazon..This is aweful..I am sure you will get a workout (strength training), but the video and instruction are horrible... she jumps from one exercise to the next with no time for you to get ready. She is using a totally different set of bands than the ones that come with the dvd..Some of the exercises she says use short band and stretch from foot to shoulder, well it obviously cannot do that. Of course the band she is using is twice as long..I am so frustrated..Waited for this to get started, now I have to go and find something else...Stay away from this..."
3,Resistance Band DVD,"The excercises were good. I found her ""frozen"" smile to be distracting. I quit using the video because of that. Also, I didn't like the voice over cueing. Linda"
5,A Good Beginning Reference,"Don't confuse this book with the 'Guide To The Pianist's Repertoire' by Maurice Hinson. It is not nearly as comprehensive. But for the money, it is a good place to start and might be all that many pianists and teachers need. The price is an added bonus. Much information at a very modest cost.Recommended"
2,Hard to operate,"I bought 2 of this for a countdown for a cruise for my daughter & myself. She didn't like it & it ""was lost"" I didn't like it because it was too hard to operate."
4,Nice Visual Aid,It was a fun visual along with our presentation to show the client how much time is left to complete their project.
1,Unfortunately dated,"The material is very dated and virtually irrelevant for Vista or XP. I would love to see an updated book by the same author, however."
5,Yoga with Grace,"I have several other DVDs I really like produced by the same instructor, so I decided to also get this one. For me, as a yoga student, I always look for an instructor who can inspire and motivate me while I am trying to replicate the same positions. And this is exactly what I get with this DVD. There is a very nice flow of movements and positions done with extreme flexibility. And then there is the beautiful grace that only a ballerina can add to a difficult yoga routine to make it looking effortless. Some occasional slight imperfections that may be noticed only give a human touch to the presentation.Overall, this is an original approach that I enjoy and it helps me executing more challenging positions. And in the same time it inspires me with the confidence that I can also do it."
3,Rogue RA-100D,"Decent shipping time, nicely packaged, but arrived with two large cracks on it! Not sure who to blame for that, but it was cracked about 3 inches on the bottom and the paint chipped off down to the wood >.< NOT a happy camper."
5,GREAT FIND,I looked online for about 2 weeks for a guitar. I read all the reviews on for this guitar and purchased it. It arrived in 2 days with standard shipping. I haven't played a guitar for about 25 years. When I opened the box and pulled it out I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing it needed was a little tuning. The sound is great; like some guitars I've looked at that cost $200. I give t five stars and it deserves them. I would definately recommend this instrument.
3,Guitar was great but one of the tuning knobs was faulty,"SO i got this guitar neatly wrapped complete with the feeling of getting something new, however the guitar knob for the 3rd string was faulty and now i have to turn it the wrong way to tune it higher..that sucked, i spent an hour trying to fix that knob, before i realized it cant be repaired..At the end of the day, the guitar sounds great and the strings provided are impeccable.."
2,Mine didn't live up to the hype,"I wasn't as impressed as other reviewers. My guitar came neatly packed, looked great, Tuned it up and am experiencing very loud buzzing from the 3rd fret whenever a string is held on the 2nd fret. The buzz is most noticeable on the D string. I don't know if this is an easy repair or not, however, I'll still have to take it to a shop before it will be playable. Maybe I got a lemon, but never the less I'm disappointed."
5,a good buy,"I've owned this guitar for about 4 months, and am pretty pleased with it. For the price, you can't beat it. The sound is adequate. It seems durable- I've accidentally knocked it over several times, and nothing has broken or come apart. It comes rigged with a decent set of strings too, I'm a lefty so I immediately took them off and strung them the opposite way, and they're still hanging in there. I highly recommend this guitar for a beginner, or for someone who simply wants an inexpensive guitar to take with them or practice alternate tunings with."
3,UPdated.,"I love the super lightweight feel of these. Can't even tell they're in. ""Earbuds"" won't fit in my ears, so I have to go over the ear. I've tried many, these are the only ones I like. Great sound. I add the little foam pad covers on the part that goes in your ear, but that's because I'm ridiculously particular. Tip:If you're rough on cords, as i am, put a spot of superglue on the part where the cord meets the jack. Done.and ps they make these with a retractable cord winder, i don't like that. makes it too heavy. fyi.UPDATE: these are not so great, due to the fact that the cord always disconnects. after four pairs, i just don't buy them anymore, too expensive. if u put a dab of superglue on the cords when u first get it, it will help. but it looks crummy."
3,"Nice earbuds, but nothing mindblowing","They're lightweight and pretty comfortable, allthough in my ears they're still prone to falling off if the cord is tugged. The sound is good, but I dont know what ""surround sound"" headphones is supposed to mean because...well they're headphones. When you have speakers strapped to your ears there's only so many places sound can come from. Good headphones, but not groundbreaking ones."
1,Wow. What terrible headphones.,"These headphones are absolutely, without a doubt the very worst headphones I've ever had the displeasure of purchasing or wearing. I've purchased headphones at target for 9 dollars that were much better. They are uncomfortable, i had to take them off after ten min it was so bad, the sound quality is terrible and it starts cracking if there is any bass in the song what so ever. Do not buy headphones."
3,"Good for exercising, just a couple of minor issues","I bought these to use when working out, and I've been pleased with them for the most part. I think they deliver excellent sound quality, and they fit comfortably. They do still occasionally come loose when I'm running, but I'm not sure if there is an earbud in existence that will stay in place 100% of the time, especially if you have smaller ears. Also, the cord started to detach from the jack after a couple of months of use. It was easily repaired with electrical tape, but still kind of annoying."
4,Good sound... in quiet places,"Surround Sound EarbudsThese earphones fit comfortably with their over-the-ear design. They sound very good for their size and are reasonably stylish. The main drawback, for me, is that you can hear outside noises CLEARLY, because they rest over your ears. They don't form any kind of seal to block out noise. I used them while working out and they were ok, but I could hear everything else in the room, too. They would probably be great if you only used them at home in a quiet room."
1,Does not Stay Connected,"I did receive the item very quickly... However, the charger cable does not stay connected to the phone... as soon as you move it one mm, it falls off. I'm not sure if the charger actually works to charge my CDM8100 as I can't get the cable to stay connected... very disappointed."
5,Jet Li at his best,"This is probably Jet Li's best movie! A must by for all Martial Arts Fanatics. The story is hilarious and the action, though a little subtle compared to other Jet Li films, is AWESOME. This is a tale of the beginnings of one of the legendary Canton Tigers. Check it out!"
2,A fast read but simple and a bit silly,In the Deep Midwinter is a book that anyone reading this review could write. A simple story line and unlikable characters with dubious morals makes this somewhat unpleasant reading. I recommend picking up a Muriel Spark novel instead for sharper observations on the upper crust.
3,A compelling middle third,"Robert Clark can write. His prose are very good when leant to description of surroundings and motivations. However, just because characters are ""well drawn"" doesn't mean that reading about them is enjoyable. I found none of them sympathetic (except for the doctors); they make unlikely decisions; much of what they have to say is uninteresting to the reader; their sex scenes are embarrassing, though not gratuitous.Nevertheless, ""In the deep midwinter"" is compelling because of the middle third of the book dealing with the consequences of Anna's unplanned pregnancy. I think Clark really gets this section right, setting out all the moral shades without being pedantic. This ought to be required reading in the U.S. right now as we contemplate a possible future without Roe versus Wade."
4,"Interesing, kind and thoughtful","Although I would not call this book profound, I went away feeling as though Clark was a thoughtful man, interested in getting inside the minds of his charactors and in taking the reader along. I think it was a nobel effort and would recomend it."
2,About 100 pages too long,"Could be a good book if the author would have used some restraint. His use of like and as---like her hair was like a field of summer wheat, he must have used comparisons like this over 100 times, distracting from the plot and making the book much too long. The story itself has possibilities but was over written."
2,Parkway Byways,"I'm planning a trip along the Blue Ridge Parkway this summer. I read discription of this book and it sounded good,but it was trips off the Parkway not the Parkway. It said the book was 1.5 inches thick,but it was 1/2 inch thick. The pictures in the book were not very good. After reviewing the book I returned it and ordered another book."
2,A Bit Disappointing,I purchased this unit because of its small size which I thought would be useful in our kitchen. We have a much larger unit of this type but it is inconvenient to use for small amounts of food. This unit chopped well but there was always a problem with unchopped food in the bottom of the glass container. With extra stirring you could manage to get everything chopped but it was a mess to have to open and close the unit many times to achieve this. It appears that a poor design of the glass bowl and cutting blades are the problem. We have gone to another small chopper and have given up using the DeLonghi unit.
5,Incredible CD - Almost serves as a defacto greatest hits!!,"Don't be turned off by the fact that this disc blends energetic live cuts with newly recorded studio songs. The flow of the CD is amazing. The live cuts burn, with bandleader-guitarist-vocalist John Ellis and the rhythm section breathing fire into the trio's back-catalog. It's a worship-oriented record that both rocks and whispers. Only ""Blessed Be Your Name"" is missing in action here, but that's OK. What's present here is some of the greatest Christian rock released this year. Get it, throw it on and throw up your CD player's volume knob."
4,Great Praise And Worship Album,"'I Stand For You' is another album of energetic Christian rock.This CD combines some previously released songs along with some new ones. It also has some studio versions and some live. They transition from one to another very well.They have a version of 'Amazing Grace' that is superb. The other live songs are particularly good. Having seen them in concert before, I can tell you that they demonstrate great passion and energy while performing.The one thing that seems a bit odd to me about this album is this: This is a worship album. They are using some previously recorded songs on it. For some reason, they left off their best worship song, 'Blessed Be Your Name' which is easily a 10 star track.Regardless, this is a band that is not shy about praising Jesus or using his name. They are extremely gifted musicians who deserve a much wider audience. I heartily recommend this album."
2,Harmless non-fun,"A friend recommended this as a wholesome compendium of family fun. Well, at the small price I paid, I jumped on it. In the event, the DVD shows family life with the huge brood and the overworked parents. As it was unscripted (it appears) there is no magic moment of comedy or pathos. It really is 'cine verite' as they say in France: true filming of simple reality. If you find the travails of a huge family funny or enlightening--perhaps you miss The Waltons--then buy this. Otherwise, save your pennies for the gumball machine..."
3,Kids are great,I love these kids and generally enjoy the show a lot. Wish the producer would show more of the Tups and less of Jon and Kate. What some folk don't understand is that the show is Jon and Kate's job.
3,My Favorite Reality Show,"I really enjoy watching Mady,Cara,Alexis.Aaden,Collin,Leah,& Joel.I like the 3rd season better though,since it's longer.Although the potty-taining session wasn't that interesting.I'm trying to save money so that I can own seasons 3-4 but untl then I'll just keepwatching seasons 1 & 2.Jon & Kate Plus Ei8ht, Seasons One & Two"
1,Child Exploitation!,"All I can say is these parents are exploiting their kids, that should be some sort of child protection agency in on this. They may not be abusing the kids, but by filming their every move and letting them support them finacially, is exploiting them. I think the writing is on the wall, Maddie is already acting out and the rest will follow...the kids will figure out they are being exploited and start resenting it.... This book and everything else the parents do, is to add wealth to their lives so they can get more material possessions at the expense of their childrens right to privacy. I think Kate is way to concerned with keeping the kids clean and 'camera ready' at all times. It's not natural and I really feel sorry for the kids. They may have more than most kids, but they have to earn the money for the family....the parents don't work...Kate acts like an obnoxious Queen Bee, not like a loving wife or mother...."
4,Love it but...,I really love Jon & Kate plus eight but was wondering why isn't every episode on the dvd set?
5,"Jon & Kate Plus Ei8ht, Seasons 1-2","Jon & Kate Plus Ei8ht, Seasons 1 - 2. This is a wonderfully, enjoyable DVD about everyday life about a real-life family with twins and sextuplets. The kids are adorably cute and Kate (the mom) is so organized, she makes handling eight kids seem like a ""cake walk."" Her husband, Jon, is a fun ""side-kick"", and a great hands-on dad. Not only will you watch everyday life at the Gosselin home, you also get to travel with them to interesting and fun places (Disney World, Oprah, pumpkin patch, Gymboree, etc.). These places may not be on this DVD, but these are some of the places the Gosselins have visited and filmed for their TV program on TLC."
4,jon and kate plus 8 seasons 1 and 2,"Just a good video for all the family, shows you how such a big family can work together, very good values in todays world, i just love this family and what they represent."
5,love this show.,"amazing show, i bought mine at walmart for 14.99. i wish the show was still going on! I am a big fan of Kate and agree with her 100%. TLC shouldve put more episodes into this show, and onto this set."
3,it could've been better,"so I have watched this show since day one. I know that this DVD is missing more than 3 episodes. It is missing the two from the Disney vacation. That was one of the better shows, especially for a person who loves disney. There are a lot of tv shows that are taped in disney land or disney world and those episodes are on the DVD's now, so why aren't they on jon and kate plus 8I also wish they would have had both shows of surviving sextuplets and twins (orrignial and revisited)."
4,Very interesting DVD's,It was interesting to see how the Gosslein family handles their busy household with eight kids and what they do as a family.
4,Love this show!!,I absolutely love this show. I have watched every episode since it begain with the special. My 5 year old and 3 year old daughters love it too. We watch it every week. I completely understand Kate with all her little things people complain about. I would be the same way if not worse. I only have 3 kids and my house is just a crazy. She is an amazing mom to those beautiful children. I just wish that every single episode would be on the dvd's. My kids would be in heaven to watch them whenever they wanted. And some of my favorite episodes were when the younger kids were still young. I recommend this show to anybody who like family programming.
3,"Jon & Kate Plus Ei8ht, Season 1 & 2 DVD","This DVD collection of the first season of the Learning Channel Reality Show of the Gosselin family - of twins and sextuplets is a delight. The little ones are adorable and Kate, although controlling and moody is to be admired for her unbelievable organizational skills. The interaction with Jon, the long-suffering dad is priceless. Love, love, love watching the sweet babies - too darned cute!!"
4,A gorgeous book,"For nearly forty years, a group of women have lived in a religious community in rural California. Some have come and gone, some have come and stayed, and almost all have been affected by the quiet and steady ways of living at Julian Pines Abbey. These interconnected stories show their diversity: nuns and battered wives, lesbians and straight women, women both celibate and sexually celebratory. ""And Then They Were Nuns"" is a witty and gloriously charming novel about these women, and a welcome invitation to a beautiful way of living in spiritual harmony with each other and the world."
5,And The They Were Nuns: A Novel,"Sweet, engaging, it draws you in. The writing is superb, thoughtful yet crafted with great brevity and a balanced economy of words, which I personally appreciate. I would highly recommend."
5,Highly recommended !!,"Have went on several of the floats in the book, most were on creeks I didn't even know existed. The details for put-ins and take-outs, water mileage, etc. have been very accurate. She speaks in the book of possibly doing another edition later on and I sure hope she does .."
5,Buy the original,Buy the original ink tank and you'll won't be sorry. Some of the refill kits or the generic ones can clog.Not worth a few dollars of problems and costly repairs. The two packs are better deals.
4,canon cartridge,The cartridge arrived in a timely manner. It took two pages to resolve the print quality which is probably more a fault of my printer than the cartridge.
3,Rebate response,"I bought 3 Canon BJP black cartridges. The rebate offer was to buy 3 and get a rebate for the 3 one. I followed all directions and just received a denial. The card states that I did not buy 3 of the same product. In fact, I did. I bought one single cartridge and one twin pack of the same cartridge. What was the problem with getting the rebate??"
4,Good summary,"I think this CD gives a good summary of all the albums that were released previously. It reflects the development of Therapy? through the albums perfectly, the greatest hits being present on the album as well. Other classics, like Meat Abstract and Teethgrinder, are present as well. Although I do miss Opal Mantra. My personal favourites are present: Nowhere, Screamager, Straight Life. However, for the real T? fans, this album would be a waste of money. The two new tracks, which are OK, do not justify this. The other edition of this album, with some B-sides, would be a better purchase. Still, if you're new to Therapy?, this album would be a good one to start at."
3,Great for new fans but lacking some of the best songs,"I love Therapy? endlessly and this is a good best-of, containing the band's most ""famous"" songs, but lacking the real great ones. , as the band says, it's a retrospective album, ten years of great music indeed. But I miss my personal favorites in here : ""Turn"", ""Animal Bones"", ""Me vs you"", ""Little tongues first"", ""Hate Kill Destroy"" or ""Black Eye, Purple Sky"". It would also be cool if they would have recorded the guitar-live version of ""Diane"", the one that was on ""Infernal Love"" is in my opinion one of the weakest Therapy? songs ever. On the other hand, I like ""Bad Karma follows you around"" - it's a great live song. I didn't get to hear ""Fat Camp"" yet, but I will as soon as one of my friends is buying this CD. A big recommodation for everyone that is getting new to Therapy? but it isn't quite great as a best of. Get the original albums for eternal listening pleasure."
1,Hardly anything original about `Prince' Movie,"Hardly anything original about `Prince' MovieDirected by Kookie V GulatiProduced by Renu Taurani, Kumar S TauraniStarring Vivek Oberoi , Nandana Sen ,Aruna Shields , Neeru BajwaAgain the concept is from a bunch of Hit Hollywood movies ( Matrix , Bourne Identity , Mission Impossible etc etc ) .It seems that the director of Price tried to make a bollywood Sci-fi but failed to do so.Music is not great , Dialogs are not impressive . Vivek Oberio wasn't impressive as an Action heroOverall a Flop Movie .Worth Watching -- >>>>Other Vivek Oberio Action Movie : Dum , Company , Yuva ."
2,wish I had read reviews before buying,"Cute pot. A pain to clean --there is no filter--good for environment, but one must scoop wet grounds out with hand. I tried pulling the stopper to loosen grounds but worse, the grounds all came flying out. The pot does not stay on long enough. I land up drinking cool coffee after 30 minutes. I am impatient and think it took too long to brew (my Delonghi percolater was fastest). Too pricey for not being perfect."
5,"The Fifth Horseman, A Sleepy Hollow Legend","I was very impressed with Mr. Gonzalez's book. I knew very little of the Sleepy Hollow Legend until I went on a business trip to the U.S. and was highly recommended to read this book by a new writer in town. I ordered it through (you guessed it) Amazon.com and started reading it in the Airport. From the very beginning, one notices his well made research on the subject which allows one to become easily absorbed by the story. Throught the book, his well thought out words leads one into the keen suspense of the plot. The ending was so vivid with detail and activity that time did not provide much of itself to become distracted. After coming back home (Bogota, Colombia)from that trip, I've become very interested in the Legend and am currently looking up all I can on the subject. I truely hope that Gregg Gonzalez will continue with his writing ventures, and provide us with more of himself in black and white."
4,It's a modern horror story of a famous and ageless legend,"Excellent book, it allows the reader to relate with the characters and provides the reader with ""dark-humor"". Intriguing, scary and a page turner."
2,NOTHING LIKE PICTURE,I THOUGHT THEY HAD SENT ME THE WRONG BRACELET-THE LEATHER WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR AND TEXTURE FROM ONLINE PICTURE AND THE PEARLS ARE SOOOO SMALL-THE WHOLE THING LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE FOR A 6 YR. OLD.I'M SO DISSAPOINTED.IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
5,Fantastic film!,"Although I love the music, I'm not normally a fan of hip-hop/rap movies, but this one really struck a cord with me.Anne Frank's diary has been my favorite book since I was a small child. It's one I've related to through my life just as Cynthia did in this film.It's very rare I can say this, but...I have nothing bad to say about this film. It is just phenomenal!"
5,thanks,i love this movie anne b. real is a really good movie i watched this movie over a thousand times
5,Extremely Moving,This movie touches the heart. It is about a young woman's dreams and family interactions. It is about broken trust and self reliance and development. It is about addiction destroying relationships. It is about a young woman's struggles to move forward in life against opposition and with a frayed support system.
1,4 words,"i have 4 words to sum up this documentary. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...Just to give you a heads up, there is not one Raiohead song played throughout the whole DVD. You will see one guy with bad achne talking about the band the whole time, and a bunch of pictures and film shots of people walking around the cities of UK...Please, dont bother with this..i am a very dedicated Radiohead fan, and i was very sad that i spent the money i did on this DVD (which doesnt even have a menu)...."
1,Horribly disappointed,"Ick, I wanted to turn it off within the first 5 mins. I'm a film major and I don't know if I've seen many worse student films than this. Anyway I definitely would not recommend this. I would recommend ""Meeting People is Easy"" though. That was excellent."
1,radiohead documentary,"Wow, what a disappointment. This has got to be the worst documentary ever made. It's unofficial, so there are no interviews with the band, Radiohead is not even on the soundtrack...nothing even remotely worthwhile. Do not waste your money on this one."
3,Not exactly what I expected,This video was interesting but not exactly what I expected. Most of the information on this video can be read by reading other articles found on the web. I thought this video would have more obscure information. Homework is not worth it if you already know the background on Radiohead.
2,Very Disappointing,"I was not really satisfied with this DVD. Just the whole fact that it was unauthorized basically ruined the whole thing. You don't hear any Radiohead music once the whole documentary. Also, there is only a few footage of Radiohead actually talking. Its basically just a bunch of pictures of the band, with other music to it. There really isn't too much stuff in here either that i did not already know about the band, and they dont even go into the albums in depth. Unless you are a crazed Radiohead fan like myself, there really is no need to own this DVD."
1,1 star is too kind,Picked it and looked at it at a gun show : If you are a total gun moron you might learn something . Bites the big one .
1,Save your money,"Almost half of this book is balistics tables, probably for cartridge and bullet combinations you are not shooting.The rest of the book is mostly geared to the beginning shooter, but the information is not very good. For instance, the authors suggest using scope bases with the built in windage adjustments. The authors must have about zero experience with these bases, which are known for unintentionally allowing your zero to shift. I don't know of any military or lawenforcment tactical shooter, or any civilian long range shooter using the scope bases and rings suggested in the book. The best shooters are using solid steel bases secured to the rifle with over sized screws.Also, there is no up to date information on long range rifles, gunsmithing, or modern cartridge and bullet design.A waste of time and money."
2,Jim Sonnenberg's 99% right,"Jim has (almost) hit the nail on the head - for the ""not so experienced"" long range shooter there are however one or two pearls contained in the text. Would I buy this again? maybe, but not at this price."
1,Too Basic,"Very very basic book, most of the book is ballistic info for rounds but its not nearly complete. youll be much happier buying a book for long range shooting, this book barely goes into detail. this was a rushed cookie cutter publication, theres way better books out there."
3,"Oh, for what could have been...","If only they would have gone with Shatner's original story treatment, where the Enterprise journeys to H-E-double-hockey-sticks and Kirk gets in a fist fight with Beelzebub, kicking ol' Scratch's horn-tailed keester, of course. Can you say camp classic, kids?"
3,Good story--mediocre SFX,"This time William Shatner takes the director's chair and puts together the most least favorite Star Trek film. Due to a worker's strike in Hollywood, The SFX aren't as strong as the previous installations. Also, there's too much focus on slapstick humor as well. This time the Enterprise must rescue some hostages...but they are soon taken hostage themselves by Spock's half-brother Sybok & taken to the center of the universe to talk with God."
3,Not that boldly,Agreeably not one of the better Star Trek films. I got it just so that I would have a complete set of the original casts movies in my dvd collection. I think this is the one that William Shatner strong armed the producers so that he could direct after the truly awesome job that Leonard Nimoy did n his directorial debut. Just hope that William Shatner will stick to acting and leave directing alone.
2,Not very good compared to the others.,"I am a big trek fan. But this movie was a mistake. I like what Leonard Nimoy said about it though. In ""I AM SPOCK"" he basically tells everybody not to blame Bill Shatner for it, because he believes Bill is a great director, but that the fault lies in the very weak storyline. Well who am I to argue with Leonard Nimoy? This is a very lame storyline if there ever was one, I won't waste anyone's time running over it. (But I do agree with the people who said that Bill shouldn't have directed. This was definatly an ego issue for him.) I will say that you should go rent this movie before you buy it. IF you are a die hard trekkie and you find you must have it just to say you have it, that's fine, but I wouldn't cry in my cheerioes if I couldn't get it tomorrow. It's really not a very good movie."
1,"The ""Plan 9"" of Star Trek Movies","This movie is the be-all, end-all proof of the odd-numbered Star Trek movie jinx. This movie started out bad, and just got worse. We can assume that this is in part due to Shatner's total inability to direct. Then again, the fact that Shatner's so bad at directing at least gives some degree of symmetry to his acting and singing skills. This movie was obviously made in order to advance the series from the good (but too-cute) Star Trek IV to the great (but Montalban-free) Star Trek VI. If there's going to be one Star Trek movie that's truly worthy of overripe fruit, this is the one. Buy this one to prove to your friends that you don't like anything with a Star Trek title. Buy this one to keep your drinks glasses from leaving rings on the table. Buy this one to prove that something did come between IV and VI."
3,"Better than any Trek today, for sure.","Is this movie flawed? Oh yes. But this has more character and feels like more, genuine Trek than anything Berman and his bunch have put out in years. It really is a startling night and day difference to go back and watch some of these older Trek films and really just see how far Star Trek has declined since in quality. Very sad. Star Trek IV is even the more outstanding example of a night and day contrast. What happened to that? What happened to Star Trek? Why was it allowed to go down so low in the past...almost decade or so?These Special Edition DVD's are must owns for Trekkers, especially the classic films.You'll enjoy this one for nostalgia and completist's sake, if nothing else."
4,Trek V-A Satisfying Entry in the Series,"There is nothing like a Trek big screen film that begins with a prologue.(Trivia:There was an original prologue that was cut from Generations where we see Kirk skkydiving, and then being informed of the christening of the latest Enterprise!)Laurence Luckinbull is fun to watch as Spock half-brother.People complain about the effects of this film.I don't see the problem with them.They serve the film as the effects in any Trek flick would! This film is fun, mainly, because there are a lot of scenes involving the trio(you know who I mean too!)Scene where Nichols sings is outstanding(that is a thrill back to the series when she did that on occasion-remember Charlie X episode).This film caught a lot of flack, but it is just as fun to watch as Wrath of Khan if you ask me."
1,Twelve more beers and I'll appreciate this movie,"This movie was so ridiculously bad. Shatner attempts to be philosophical, writing a script in which the crew of the Enterprise visits ""God"", who, for some reason, confines himself in some forsaken region of the galaxy. At one point ""God"" asks the crew if he could borrow the spacecraft so he could leave the forsaken place. The crew are suspicious, ""What would GOD want to do with a spaceship?"". That's how deep this movie is."
2,Not quite the worst...,"This movie is not quite as bad as The Motion Picture, but doesn't come close to The Wrath of Khan or First Contact. Only real ST fans should watch this. P.S At the end of the movie both Kirk and spock make a stupid mistake. Kirk says ""I lost a brother once, I was lucky to get him back""(refering to Spock in ST2 and ST3), but he DID lose his elder brother at the end of the first season of TOS!"
2,Horrible,"I've seen all the Star Trek movies, and many of the original series, TNG, DS9, and Voyager episodes. You could call me a Trekkie. This movie has made it into my collection only because it is a Star Trek movie, not because I liked it. It is horrible and I only watch it so I know what it is about for any Trekkie Trivia questions."
3,Is it really that bad?,"""Star Trek V"" was panned by critics (the same critics who praised the ridiculous and torturously dull fourth movie) because the plot was hard to follow. And it's true, the plot is jumbled for about the first hour. Even so, critics should at least appreciate that the film tried to stay faithful to the Enterprise's mission of ""boldly going where no man has gone before,"" instead of focusing on Kirk's relationship with Spock, diplomatic squabbles with other alien species, or trendy 20th century issues like saving the whales. And the ending is great. Of all of the movies with the original cast, this is my third favorite. It is overlooked by fans and undeservedly so."
2,To Boldly Go Into Mediocrity,"The Starship Enterprise goes on a spiritual quest in this lackluster fifth installment. An infamous William Shatner vanity project, ""The Final Frontier"" (1989) is plagued by the actor's directorial inexperience and a poorly developed script. At least the camera stays in focus. Despite its $28 million budget, ""Star Trek V"" plays like a mediocre TV episode and, therefore, fares better on the small screen."
4,Not the best Star Trek but Star Trek nonetheless,Not the best in the franchise but don't let all the Trekkies who gave this a bad review fool you it's still Star Trek. And I guarantee you that they have watched it more than once.
3,Has its moments...,"A less than stellar entry in the series. But I loved every big screen STAR TREK film for different reasons. To me, I like what most Trekkers like about it. It is funny at points (especially the campfire scene) and has a very good moment in the middle with Sybok, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. I thought of an addition to the movie's tagline but its pretty cruel. The tagline was: Why are they putting seatbelts in the theaters this summer? MY ANSWER: To keep people from leaving. Im only kidding. I think Shatner had a different idea and was over criticized. He made do with what he had ."
3,"Not the best , not the worst","This is inferior to Star Trek II and IV and others, but much better than The Motion Picture and Insurrection -- it places number 7 out of 9. The scene where we learn about the things that have haunted Spock and McCoy is great. We finally know why McCoy is so irritable: he let his father die right before a cure to his disease was found. I love the idea of giving his anger a definite source. And Kirk's line about ""needing his pain"" was a highpoint, also."
1,terrible,"This was, by far, the worst of the Star Trek movies. As a ""die hard"" Trekkie, I was completely disappointed with the story, the writing, the acting. The special effects were okay. The only credit to this film was the introduction of the new type II phaser. Shame on you guys."
1,"""Three Stooges in Space""","I still remember my friend's one-line review of this movie as we left the theater. She was reacting to the final scene with Spock, McCoy and Kirk singing (off key) around a camp fire, one of many pathetic and ineffectual attempts at humor. About a dozen of us had ditched work to see Star Trek V when it came out and, boy, were we disappointed. What an embarrassement!This movie has little offer non-fans. If possible, it is even more annoying to life-long Trekkers, such as myself, with its violations of the canon with regard to Sybock, the renegade Vulcan (I won't spoil it, if you are determined to watch it) and out-of-character behavior by Spock and others.The movie that confirmed the odd-numbered Star Trek movie curse. Watch II, IV, VI or First Contact (VIII) again, instead of wasting your time on this turkey."
2,Starts well and then falls away.An idea for Paramount .,"""Every man hides a secret pain""says Star Trek 5.I'm sure that women would wonder what happened to them in this little piece of philosophy.Seriously,Paramount should redo the effects of this film.Even the current tv show has better effects so it wouldn't cost much to redo them.And one really good idea:get the supporting cast-Nichell Nichols,James Doohan,George Takei and Walter Koenig to sit down and do a commentary on the Star Trek films.What great stories they could tell!And what a great marketing ploy it would be."
5,Most brilliant,"Shatner did a superb job as director: the camera angles are beautiful--we have a marvelous view of Spock's face, the handsome devil. Moreover, the makeup humbles nature: I'v enever seen more perfectly crafted Vulcan ears. As for the plot, I think its a welcome change from the humanistic if not agnostic leanings of Star Trek; the search for God? What an original idea! Shatner wisely took control of this great action flick that will change your perception of life...forever!"
2,Bad,"Well now, this is by far the worst Star Trek movie ever. The movie is so innacurate, such as how the Enterprise made it to the center of the galaxy, over 30,000 light years away, in under a few hours. You watch shows like Star Trek Voyager, where the ship is stranded 70,000 light years away from Earth, and the trip will take decades. The Enterprise-A is a much older and slower ship than Voyager, and it should take them decades to reach the center of the galaxy, not hours.The innacuracies is not the only thing, I cannot think of anything more dumb than a ""god search"" by a Vulcan on Star Trek! I have been a Star Trek fan for a very long time, but even as a fan, I must say that this movie does not portray the Star Trek franchise in a very good way at all."
1,The worst of the Star Trek movies.,"This is a movie that starts off well, but after the beginning it progressively gets worse. The opening scene showing Kirk, Spock, and McCoy on shore leave in Earth's Yosemite Park was, in my opinion, the best part of an otherwise worthless movie. After the opening scene on Earth, the plot became so unbelievably stupid that I felt like I was watching one of the more crappy Star Trek episodes instead of a Star Trek movie. After seeing this movie, I sort of got the feeling that it was a movie that was made just for the sake of being made, and not much more. Unless you're a die hard Star Trek fan, don't buy this movie. This one is barely rentable."
1,I asked my girlfriend what her favorite part was ...,"... and she said,""The end.""Boy, did this stink. It was very uninteresting, and anyone could see where the plot was going. About 70% of the Next Generation episodes have been better than this thing."
1,Oy! What a mess!,"Well, this was the first major clinker of the big screen Star Trek sagas - but then I am not telling you anything new here.Shatner ... can't ... direct! (Apply pseudo Shakespearean emphasis).Thankfully, Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country, (a/k/a ""The Apology"") made up for the mess. But my collection of cassettes/DVDs sure looks strange with out this title to complete the sets."
1,awful!,"I found this movie to be so awful that I can't even remember anything about it, other than Uhura's ludicrous fan dance. I guess I just blocked it out of my mind. As a fairly dedicated Star Trek fan, I'm very glad the following movies were far superior. Shatner needs to stay away from directing!"
3,"Hey, if the storyline's bad, no director can save it...","so quit blaming Shatner as the director. In fact it's because of Shatner directing the movie, that it's watchable at all. If some guy like Nicholas Meyer who's good with special effects and ""treknology"" but is no good with people like Shatner is; if he had been given this movie, it would have been a true disaster, cause the humanity wouldn't be there.The chemistry between the characters are there, and the humour is there. All of these things in a movie comes from the director's touch, it doesn't happen automatically, if anyone though so.You can't just place Shatner, Nimoy and Deforest Kelley in a room and except them to work well together, it takes the director's touch to broung this particular chemistry to life, and this is what Shatner does so well in this particular movie."
3,It might have been so much better if...,"Just fair to my mind. So much went into this, it had so much potential, yet somehow still fell flat. And as a result it was something to view once and never see again, since it was all plot with little or no story.But...BUT...what if the creature had been revealed to be Gary, from the 60's Star Trek episode ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"": Kirk's ""old friend"" from Star Fleet Academy, the one who was endowed by that same energy barrier with the god-like powers, the friend who Kirk then attempted to maroon on an unihabited planet to protect humankind, failed, and then apparently killed and left for dead...?What if Gary had somehow survived?Imagine Kirk's astonishment when the creature's face appeared, reverted to its original form of Kirk's old friend Gary, and then he/it said to Kirk in that same dry, bitter, ironic tone, ""Hello, old friend....""Now THAT alone would have made up for so many lesser scenes in this movie."
4,Not The Best But....,"I always wondered what they would come out with after the Voyage Home and I wasn't too surprised by what came up. Some of the insight into the main characters backgrounds was nice but the movie really just didn't make it. I liked OK, but not one of the best Star Treks."
3,Almost A Really Good Film,"I rate this movie 2.5 stars. The first half of this movie is very good. But after the true origin of the Sybok character is revealed, it starts to unravel a little. A couple of annoying science and continuity errors (72 decks or somesuch, 6.7 HOURS to reach the galactic center which is a mega-radioactive region with a mega-black hole?!). Otherwise, the often weak special effects in the second half are the only real letdown. Bill Shatner should be proud of his direction: but a slight script rewrite and higher FX budget would have helped this movie a great deal."
3,"it does have its problems, but. . . .","let's face it, this film, at times, rings extremely hollow. it's downright laughable in moments, but to give this film its due, it delves into some pretty thought provoking and timely issues that deal with the quest to find some sort of meaning at the heart of human existence and those who would exploit that desire. shatner can be an awful director, but he also succeeds in bringing out some of the most stirring human moments in terms of the interaction between Bones, Spock, and Kirk that really serve as a juxtaposition to the desire of zealots to look outwards for spiritual significance when the bonds that hold humanity together are a hell of a lot closer to home.5 is the best and the worst of trek, but what it does well, it does extremely well."
3,"Not as bad as the first one, but not as good as #3.","After the farce of the whales, this is not nearly as bad as reputation suggests. Fast & funny, this movie is a great way to kill 2 hours. Sure, Shatner cannot direct himself and the jokes do wear thin, but the overall direction is compelling and fast paced. With better special effects and a more of a slam-bang ending, it could have been a classic. But, if you compare it to say, The Avengers, or even Star Trek 1, you've got a decent film here.Good movie!"
4,The Final Frontier for Star Trek humor,"Considered almost universally (no pun intended) the worst of all Trek movies, it may not be the best, but in my own opinion it is certainly not the worst. I won't give spoilers on the plot, but its one that is certainly appropriate for Star Trek. The banter and humor between Kirk, Spock and McCoy is top-notch and the speical effects are adequate. Overall, an above-average entry into the Trek movie collection."
3,"Shatner's folly? Yes, but . . .","Usually reviewers comment on how Shatner's ego seems to permeates every aspect of the film. True, but more importantly, when you look just below the surface it becomes apparent that we have an almost unfiltered view of Mr. Shatner's id! Very disturbing, but very funny too. This is the only place where you can learn: 1) It's possible to escape a photon torpedo blast by hiding behind a bolder. 2) God doesn't live at the center of the galaxy. 3) I need my pain - it's part of what makes me who I am."
1,This is the WORST Star Trek movie ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is horrible!! I have never seen a worse Star Trek movie. It has some good things about it but this movie doesn't fit in. I'm a Star Trek fan and I love Star Trek, but this movie is a insult to Star Trek and everything Gene Roddenberry worked for!!!"
2,"What genius let Shatner direct, anyway?","This movie is so pathetic that I've almost completely blocked it out of my mind. Kind of like when someone experiences something extremely traumatic in their life and they can't remember anything about the event afterwards. What, there was a Star Trek V?I won't be buying this one. But, it's Star Trek, so I can't give it only one star."
3,Worst Trek YET but....Still Worth Watching,"First let me give you my top 10 before I explain.1) The Wrath of Khan2) First Contact3) Nemesis4) The Undiscovered Country5) Insurrection6) The Voyage Home7) The Search for Spock8) Generations9) The Motion Picture10)This movieNow in saying this is the worst movie, I mean that it has the weakest villain ever imagined, a very weak story, and some really cheesy effects. Now having said that, there is one tangible that makes this movie worth watching. The cast. The Original cast adds so much to this. Their chemistry together makes this worth watching. The comedy may go overboard sometimes but still it is good 60% of the time. It may be the worst movie of all the Trek movies but still the cast tried their hardest to make this look good."
4,The ONLY good Star Trek film!,"(...) as far as I'm concerned, this is the ONLY Star Trek movie worth watching. Star Trek IV came close (but no cigar), but Star Trek V knocks the ball out of the park, it's the ONLY Star Trek movie that connects with what made the original series so good."
2,Why?,Only redeeming value is the great musical score which eventually became the theme for The Next Generation TV series!
2,a disappointment,"i had hoped the audio commentary,deleted scenes etc would make up for what the film itself lacked.they did'nt."
2,WORST! ---excerpt Jerry Goldsmith score,"I'm not the fan of Star Trek. But, I watched several star trek film, and 'Star Trek 5' is worse and more stupid than other one. Though some people said Star Trek Series is becoming BLAND, I want to say one thing, ""Hey, at least it's better than 'Star Trek 5'! "" At Least, Jerry Goldsmith's exellent score is brilliant... It is one of the example for scoring sequel in wonderful way...."
3,"Ebert says the worst, well I beg to differ","Yes Star Trek 5 had it's share of problems. in fact there is a person on Youtube who took the movie and did their own CG graphics and it is way better than the original film. Something Paramount should look into and arrange with this person to redo the film to make it better.As to the worst, SORRY Mr. Ebert but of the Trek films Generations holds that title. Compared to Generations, and it's story line, Trek five seems like a decent movie. GENERATIONS not only has a horrible story line, especially once inside the nexus. Yeah it's 80 years after Kirk's death and yet from his view point he just arrived in the nexus also, what he lay in limbo for 80 years? the whole opening with the 1701-B was way to fast, and short leaving huge gaps and questions, then the whole soran, klingon, and especially picards alter life in the nexus just dragged! So No Mr. Ebert Star Trek 5 was NOT the worse by any means."
3,The Final Frontier is Like Pizza...,"...it's good even when it's bad. As a result, I believe The Final Frontier is severely underrated. There are many flaws with this movie. First, Klingon Commander Klaa is an extremely weak nemesis with equally weak motives. Most of the time, he just comes off as cheesy. Also, the ending is a major let down. But one must remember that Shatner didn't have the budget to have rock-like creatures attack him.Even though the special effects are awful, TFF more than makes up for it by having great character interaction. TFF gives ample screen time to Scotty, Sulu, Chekov, and Uhura (even though some of it was cheesy). But most importantly, the movie focused on the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad. This movie shows the best Kirk-Spock-McCoy interaction of any Star Trek movie. The 2009 Star Trek movie clearly lacked this essential element."
5,Powerful life changning experience,"Feel the power of the best movie ever made, from the sci-fi action, to the profound theological statements to the sexy three-breasted aliens, it makes a great movie."
1,Glad I saw this turkey at a matinee.,"What's wrong with this phrase ""William Shatner, Film Amateur""? Yeah, you just figured out what's wrong with this film.STAR TREK V is the worst Trek ever. Control was transferred to Shatner because of a contractual obligation. That's not a good reason to make someone producer, director, writer.At one time, STAR TREK was about the story of the voyages of the Starship Enterprise and a wonderful mission to push out the boundaries of human knowledge and wisdom. This flick is to show off Shatner as a horseman and a climber of rocks. Jeez, James T. Kirk was NEVER that kind.Come on, retire this tired old cast. The stories in the current STAR TREK TV series are a purer form of Trek than ANY of these sorry films have ever been."
1,Star Trek Animated v-5,The weekest of the 11 volumes. I erased the first episode showing satan as a misunderstood alien. The second one is only ok. A bad link to a great cartoon series.
1,Pathetic Trek,"This is undoubtedly the worst of the Star Trek movie series.Directed by William Shatner,it should have been titled ""Star Trek meets T.J.Hooker""simply because Shatner tried to direct it with the same style that he used to direct his old series.This should be thrown in the trash.F- at best."
1,ST5 has no real story.,"Captain Kirk allows his starship to be taken over with no oppositon at all.No security team,no warning even though he is in direct contact with his ship and,worst of all,he flys the villian up to the ship after telling him him that he wouldn't help him(does that make sense?).Is this the same captain that self-destructed his previous ship to avoid it's capture?In this film the Enterprise is portrayed as a faulty and clunky ship,a classic gimmick when you have a weak villian.This is a bad film,a voyage to nowhere where nothing happens.Avoid it."
4,Lighten Up!,"""To Boldy Go Where No Man Has Gone Before."" This is what Star Trek is about. Unlike Star Wars, which is concerned about special effects and non stop action, Star Trek at least cares about it's main characters. ""The Final Frontier"" isn't the best Trek movie, nor is it the worst. The plot of finding God didn't rub me the wrong way. Trek is about exploring, and finding God is exploring. Also, the trio (Kirk, Spock, McCoy) were all excellant. The whole point of the camp scene, which has been much maligned, is to show the bond between the friends--and that is more watchable than a special-effect driven scene. Shatner did a fine job directing, too."
1,THE WORST OF ALL STAR TREK FLIKS,STAR TREK V in one word yawn!!!. I can not to this day believe to this day this movie was ever made. Yes WILLIAM SHATNER directs and was expierence I'd like to forget going to find god? please!!! that has no place in a STAR TREK film at all. Also watch out for row row your boat I won't say who sings it but it'll make you cringe avoid STAR TREK V THE FINAL FRONTIER at all costs.
3,The Film Paramount wished never happened.,"William Shatners effort, some would say, but a clause in his contract for Star Trek four gave him the right to direct the follow up movie. I seen this movie when it opened in the UK and i thought it was very good, apart from the end. It makes us see a side of the characters which we never see very often, humour. Sean Connery was asked to play the role of Sybok, but turned it down to star along side Harrison Ford in The Last Crusade. The reason the ending of this movie turned out bad was that William Shatner ran out of money, so the ending looks phony in most parts. But i would say that this movie is much better than The Motion Piture which is a good film if you like Special effects but the story line is terrible. At least Star Trek five had a story line."
2,One of the Worst of Star Trek Series,"This movie is boring, and the characters don't seem real. There are a few good one-liners but that's about it. If you are a die-hard Trekkie, see it. Otherwise, forget it."
2,The worst trek movie,This movie has continuity errors and is not very funny. They could have done better.
3,Good but it could have been much better,"Star Trek V is commonly considered the worst of the star trek movies and alot in it is bad but it is watchable. This movie needed a much larger budget than it was given and a lot of William Shatner's original story was changed, mostly for the worst. If the movie had been given a adequate budget, Shatner would have gotten to film more scenes and afford better special effects. This would improve Star Trek V dramatically and if the storyline hadn't been changed this film would probably deserve a 4 1/2 or even 5 star rating."
2,Shatner helms a baddie...,"Besides the new ""Insurrection,"" this is the only ""Star Trek"" movie that feels tired, like we've seen it before. William Shatner directs and stars in this ho-hum film that leaves much to be desired. The plot concerns a renegade Vulcan named Sybok hijacking the Enterprise and taking it to the center of the universe to find God. It's not a pretty sight. Most of the characters we know and love have nothing to do here but act like zombies, especially Uhura, who gets naked and sings in front of Sybok's desciples. Why was this scene put in there? Don't get me wrong, Nichelle Nichols is a wonderful actress, but this is embarrassing to watch. As for Shatner's direction, it's actually not that bad. His writing needs plenty work, though."
1,Star Trek V,My husband got me this movie for our anniversary.WORST ANNIVERSARY GIFT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Just a warning for anyone thinking about it.
2,Simply Said - It Stunk,"This is a simple review. Lawrence Luckinbill was terrific as Sybok, but the story line was absurd, even for Sci-Fi. Too bad Lawrence Luckinbill had to be wasted on this trash."
4,"Not The Best, Not The Worst!",Ok so this movie had scenes that totally stunk but there was aslo some scenes that were totally great so I think that though this is one of the worst Trek movies its not the absolute worst and isn't all bad and is probably worth buying if you are a major die-hard Trek fan and have to own every Star Trek item!Personally my least favorite Star Trek movie is Star Trek III: The Search For Spock wich I personally find to be the worst!
3,"NOT THE BEST TREK FILM, NOT THE WORST (insurrection)","Star TRek V is considered by most as the worst entry of the film series, I disagree on that point, I think insurrection is!Anyway... I am looking forward to getting the special editionof Star Trek V, I am big on special features and have collectedthe first four films in the double disk format already. I learn may interesting facts about the film and the TEXT commentaries are GREAT... I am especially looking forward to the special edition release of my personal favorite ""Old Crew"" film Star Trek VI and I am patient enough to enjoy V for a while. Hey ITS A TREK FILM none the less..."
2,Worthless trainwreck....,"Not sure why this movie was made. I realize they were trying to venture away from the storyline that was Star Treks 2 through 4. However, they did a horrible job of it with this one. Spock's half brother? 1) Who cares? 2) Who believes it? After 50 years aboard the Enterprise you'd think he might have mentioned it to somebody by now. Surely it would've come up over dinner or something.The entire film is dead and unbelieveable from that introductory moment. A feeling Vulcan that apparently was disowned or disinherited by his people. Shunned or what have you. He becomes a less maniacal version of Khan from Star Trek 2.By the end, you just want Kirk to take out his phaser and kill the guy."
3,Good old Star Trek fun,"With this movie it seemed that Star Trek was winding down, but on the other side TNG was taking off. It is still good old Star Trek fun in spite of a poor plot, terrible scenes and low budget visual effects. On the other hand it follows the comic tradition of Star Trek IV and the original series and it is still a human adventure. For Trek fans it is good to see William Shatner's perspective on the nature of the series but as Trek movies go it is probably the worst (after Nemesis)."
1,Shatner - Stay In Front Of The Camera!,"As you have read above, this is the worst of the 9 (Soon to be 10)films. It has some very cute and short sentimental moments in it and a great senic opening of Yosemite National Park, plus a gorgeously wonderful score by my favorite composer Jerry Goldsmith - but - overall, no story, no story, no story. Did I mention no story?Shatner should have not let the producers take over. When I read his memorars about the shooting of this film, Shatner says the movie was completely different. It was budget cuts and studio pressures made it into something it was never intened to be.If that's true, then cudos to Shatner, but as a film....""The Muppet Movie"" was much, much, much more entertaining. Sorry Bill!"
3,Mystery Science Theater 3000 material ..it's a stinker !!,"I can see see Servo and the robots viewing this movie on the program. I can see them doing jokes about Shatner's stunt double doing the rock climbing and fights. The whole plot with the God planet is real bad. I don't know how Shatner got this one made. If Paramount is for a re edit with new special effects and the ""rock people"" the Shatty one wanted to come out of the pit I'm all for it. On a special effects dependent feature like this one it would be worth it to revamp the effects. It would have saved the whole film to have a worth while ending. You can't blame poor Bran Ferren; the special effects producer. He was given a small budget and could not work outside of the money given him to produce a decent movie."
2,Disappointed.,"Eh, this book is more about creating your space in the kitchen, and the energy of the kitchen, rather than providing great recipes. I was really just hoping for some wholesome 'good for the body and soul' type recipe ideas, rather than prayers to the goddess for each season. The stuffed acorn squash recipe was great, but that's about it."
4,great cookbook,I have really enjoyed using this book. She does a wonderful job of making the kitchen a fun and blessed place to play. The food is good also. I strongly recomend this book to anyone who is looking for a natural way to live and expierence life.
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I've had this book on my Wish List for a while and finally recieved it. While I have not yet read it cover to cover, I did look at all the recipes and this is when my disappointment set in.I was not expecting a vegetarian/vegan cookbook. Nowhere in the book's description does it states that the recipes are vegetarian or vegan. The recipes in the book, however, do sound good and I plan to try them out, but perhaps Cait Johnson or Destiny Books should label their books accordingly in the future. Kitchen Witches do not have to be vegetarian or vegan."
5,A heartfelt offering,"This book lays out a spiritual practice of reconnection with nature and the seasons of the year through the food we eat and its preparation. As with all paths there is a need to establish the environment and rituals for practice that enable the alchemy of transformation. With chapters on setting up the sacred space of the kitchen and rituals based around the wheel of the year, the stage is set for connection to our world through feeding our bodies. The healthy, earthy vegetarian recipes sound deeply satisfying for both body and soul. The dishes I have tried were a joy to make and eat."
3,Suprised,"I was suprised that this was a vegan/vegetarian cookbook. After that wore off, I liked the book. I like books that I don't have to actually cook to enjoy. I was able to curl up with a glass of wine and read this without ever have to turn on the oven. I tagged some recipes to try later and have found the ones that have been made to be good. I am looking forward to making some more of them."
5,Great gift,"Well made for children. Quality material & durable. This book engages their senses. It is a touch & feel book, as well as a counting & ""can you find"" book."
5,Simply the Best,"Dont walk,run to buy this system.Will rival many audiophile high end Stereos. Worth the price for the tuner alone. Dollar for Dollar superior to Bose. Professional design with unique extra features. No audible distortionat high volumes. I beleive this is the most powerful and clean consumer amp. Ive ever heard. JBL supplies half of all recording studios. No better THIB,not by a long shot. Im hearing things on old analog recordings,unheard before. Color coded wiring and inputs make this the easiest system to assemble to date. Quite frankly, JBL didnt ""dumbdown"" for the home theatre market. The solid, Heavy constructionmakes this a keeper for many years.You can feel confident its equally a stereo and Home Theatre system...But dont tell JBL. Another nice thing is the absence of stupid,glitzy featuresthat never get used,and only distractfrom the real issue. Power. 500 wattsAmazing System."
5,Nothing Better for the Price,"Flat out the best system at this price. The sound quality is just what you would expect from JBL. Having the 5 disc changer makes it perfect for parties...... set the CD's in the player and just let it do it's thing. The compact speakers will surprise most people when they first see the small size, but the sound that comes out of them will blow them away. More options than I can even go into (i.e: DSP imaging, sleep timer, DVD options). Get it and enjoy."
5,This System is the BEST,"This is a great system. Sound from the speakers is incredible. Had a Yamaha System before I picked this one up and it totally blows the Yamaha away. Recently watched SwordFish and some scenes actually made my walls shake and the volume wasn't even at half. Setup is simple...Do yourself a favor and get this system, you won't be sorry."
4,My Altec Lansing Computer Speakers Have Better Sound,The overall package is good. It lacks some mid-range sound. I also starve for more bass.
3,"read it, but dont expect wonders","This book isnt a must read, but it wont kill you. I read it early on and it enspired a few things in me just from the characters. I cant agree much with the detail that the other reviewer mentioned, but the characters were interesing. There wasnt much thought put into the story and it all runs like an RPG translated into a book, but if you have a week to spare to read the three books then go for it."
3,avatar,"Richard Awlinson stood for all-in-one. A group of TSR writers wrote different parts of the series. This one was written by Scott Ciencin. A good book, the best of the avatar series for my money, and introduces some interesting characters, Midnight, Cyric and Kelemvor. They will later all go spectacularly wrong and mutate beyond recognition, but here at the beginning, they are a surprisingly likeable bunch. Look for Cyric's heroic defense of Shadowdale."
5,Tsr Book,"A great set of books if you can get your hands on them, this one in perticular starts off the trilogy & is quite hard to find, but this good company here had it, I recommend them."
2,A waste of Time,"I love the Forgotten Realms series and the AD&D RPG games to go along with it. After just finishing the last of R.A Salvatore's books I picked up the first book in the Avatar trilogy expecting it to be up to par. It wasn't! If you are a fan of fantasy novels I recommend passing this one by in the Library or the book store. The plot was ill-conceived and the characters were bad. It was torture for me just to finish it. Obviously by the other reviews though, some people like it and maybe it just isn't the style of book I like to read. I see this book as a waste of time but you might not. I guess you can read it and see."
2,Unmemorable,"I read this trilogy ages ago when I was a kid and the fact that I remember so little shows that it was nothing special. Many others have said that the writing style is very ordinary and this is true in that it did not stand out at all. There was some interest in the plot (in this book I do remember the battle around Shadowdale to be an interesting section) but I guess having read it as a kid means the plot could be interesting to kids but not necessarily adults.If you are a Forgotten Realms fan (which I'm not, I was given the books) then the added interest of this as a background story as well as connections to the world of the Realms will probably outweight the negative aspects of the book such that it may be worth reading. Otherwise, it's fairly pointless."
1,Just Bad Writing,"If this is an example of books that TSR release, then theyshould just stick to role-playing games. This book is filled withliterary cliches one after another. The characters are flat. The descriptions are bad. The only reason I gave this book a two instead of a one is because the plot is not so bad. If someone else was writing this book using the same plot, then I might bring myself to complete it."
1,Avoid at all costs...,"I picked up this book, the first in the Avatar Trilogy, fresh off the heels of having read ""The Icewind Dale Triology"" and ""The Dark Elf Trilogy"" by R.A. Salvatore. I was highly disappointed. The prose is written in an awful style; it reminded me of reading ""The Illiad"", except that the Illiad was interesting! It was an absolute chore to read this book, so much so that I never finished it and never read the other two books in the series even though I foolishly bought all three at the same time.Avoid."
2,Intriguing idea marred by bad writing,"The Avatar Trilogy is often entertaining, but the quality of the writing is shaky at best. The authors employ too many literary cliches, and the text is blemished by a number of technical mistakes which any decent copy editor ought to have caught. I did enjoy the authors' uncommon characterization of the gods as petty and meddlesome -- this idea, reminiscent of the ancient Greek pantheon, is curiously absent in most of today's fantasy literature. Overall, the books earn a marginal thumbs-down from me. My advice: read the trilogy if you have a chance, but don't buy; borrow instead."
2,Ok bio,"There are not many biographies of Heydrich, and Günther Deschner's would be by far the best one. This book is an ok read, but the chronology is somewhat difficult to follow, there is indeed much more discussion of others than of Heydrich and the book could have stood for better editing. For those specifically interested in Heydrich, this book would be an ok read, otherwise, Deschner's bio is more comprehensive."
2,It doesn't work,"Like other reviewers, I thought this was going to be a unique, fresh indie film with gay themes. From the first moment of video, bad lighting, bad sound, questionable acting, I thought: ""What?!""I fell asleep in this ""film"" twice and was only awoken because a phone goes off several times.I try hard to support indie film, but people who do these projects have got to understand: 1) You don't just point and shoot; 2) the sound MUST be stellar; 3) You don't use flourescent room lighting; 4) if someone is in another room and you are shooting through an open door looking upon that room, you mike it from where the actors are standing, not from where the camera is; 5) if actors are going to ""ad lib"" then make sure it is worth listening to; and... well, you get the idea.Maybe it looked good on paper, but it didn't work for me."
5,Great Product/Price,hard to find purple color (daughters school colors) and good play ball for her. She loves it and should last a few years even through her 'ground ball' use outside. great price for product.
1,Flat basketball,The basketball arrived flat. I was expecting to have it all aired up. It was not. I think this is a bad way to ship a ball. I have no idea how to air it up for my nephew. Not happy.
1,Warning,"This book was written by someone who simply wants to sell books to liberals. Not a great starting point for intellectual honesty, but great for people who want -- who actually strive -- to delude themselves. Take drugs or read this book. The choice is yours. Want a recommendation? Read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations and stop lying to yourselves."
5,Insightful and Wickedly Funny,"I thought I would wouldn't want to read ANYTHING else about the never-ending election of 2000 -- but this book had me scratching my head and smiling from start to finish. Roger Simon gives us a first-person account from McCain's Straight Talk Express all the way through the ""riots"" in Broward County. I especially enjoyed Gore campaign manager Bill Daley's thoughts on the whole convoluted mess. Simon's perspective is irreverent, well-written and just plain interesting. A must-read for political junkies -- and anyone who wants the inside scoop on ""Election 2000."" The perfect Father's Day gift for my father the C-SPAN fan."
5,Soul Shaping by Douglas J Rumford,"Douglas Rumford gives a comprehensive, but simple, path to spiritual growth. I found the book most helpful and have used some quotes and concepts presented in the book to help my friends along their spiritual journey."
3,My birds don't use it :(,"Bought this to keep my parakeets warm in winter. Unfortunately, the opening on the front is small and the cutout is stiff, so my birds didn't use it and I don't think they went in once. It kind of sits crookedly, as well. Material is fine and maybe it's better if you have a slightly bigger bird. However, might be tough for a parrot to fit through the hole, too."
3,ER Fan,"Wasn't the best season but ER was a good series and that's hard to say about most TV today in my opinion. So, when nothing is on, I have this and other DVD series to watch."
4,ER at it's finest,"The fourth season is one of the best. This is ER when it was still ""pure"".... all of the Old Cast was still in place along with some new standouts."
4,not as good as the previous 3 seasons,"Er has been on along time and has had its ups and downs and season 4 was a down season, we had watched the previous 3 seasons before watching season 4 and stopped about half way through becouse it was not as exciting as seasons 1-3. That being said if you are an ER fan and want to collect the series this is a must have and is worth a look and worth owning if you can get it for around $20."
3,Gift,I bought this as a gift for my husband who thought the movie was hysterical when it first came out. It still makes him laugh
3,"Pretty Dumb, Pretty Funny","This film makes low-brow comedy look sophisticated, but you won't be able to help laughing (or at least groaing, which is the aim of most puns anyway). If you're in the mood for really dumb humor, this is pretty funny."
3,these reviews mean nothing,how can Amazon put these reviews on the 2 movie DVD of Night Patrol when it only came out in Oct 2011 and some of these reviews go back 7 years..There are dozens of sites that review movies..There is no need for a review of a movie on Amazon..Amazon reviews should be about the DVD..I have no idea if this version of the movie is cut or if there are any special features because all the reviews are from past releases..some seem to be reviewing the 10 year old VHS tape..how are any of these reviews relevant to this new version..
5,"FINALLY! ""L.A.P.D.! Police run out of control!""","At last, the Citizen Kane of low budget bad taste comedies is on its way to DVD. With an unreal cast including The Unknown Comic, Linda Blair, Pat Paulsen, Andrew Dice Clay, Billy Barty, Pat Morita and others, Night Patrol made history upon its release in 1984 by stretching the boundaries of taste and decency in film comedy to new limits. Dismissed by mainstream critics as a knockoff of Police Academy, the film has survived with a rabid cult following to this day and now comes the news we've been awaiting. Thank you Anchor Bay for continuing to be the #1 cult DVD company anywhere, and keep up the great work!"
4,one of the funniest movies of all time!,"this is one of the funniest movies of all time. this and the naked gun are the two most funniest movies of all time. but night patrol is maybe funnier. i mean in maltin's summary he said this movie has one-lines you won't believe. that's totally true,but maltin still gave this movie a bad rating. but i don't care. night patrol has the most off the wall crude jokes you'll ever see. i can just think of a joke in this movie is start bustin' out laughing. you just have to see this movie."
2,NIGHT PATROL,"I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,MOSTLY FOR LINDA BLAIR.AFTER SEENING IT AGAIN,I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS MOVIE.IT IS A CHEESY,CORNY MOVIE.THERE WERE SOME FUNNY PARTS IN IT.BUT AFTER SEENING IT AGAIN I PROBABLY WON'T LET IT TAKE UP ANY SPACE ON MY SHELVES."
5,Better than Dream Theater,"I just recently discovered this band and I think their music and especially the singing is better than Dream Theater hands down. I own some Dream Theater cds,but they have been suplanted by this one cd. I would recommend this cd for anyone who loves Progressive metal music!"
5,The finest prog metal i have heard in a long time.,"This is a phenominal album. The Dreamscape members obviously have incredible playing abilities, and you can hear this in beautiful solo sections. However, they do not allow the soloing to get in the way of the songs like some prog bands do, and instead have acheived the perfect balance between hard-core prog virtuosity and melodic metal symphonic sound. They sound quite a bit like Dream Theater, and are often compared to them, but do have their own unique sound, in that they are more epic and melodic in their songwriting than DT, and also do not allow songs to get completely out of hand with bizarre time signatures and lengthy solo sections. In addition to this, Dreamscape's vocalist is superior in fact to DT's James Labrie, and although I am a dedicated Dream Theater fan, I am finding that I enjoy Dreamscape even more than DT now. You cannot go wrong with this album."
2,Waste of money,"I used it to cut out the old grout in my kitchen. I went to buy more grout blades and was shocked at the price, about $40 a blade. I do a lot of work around the house and used this Fein MultiMaster 2 or 3 times in 4 years. Now it it just a dust collector. IMO, not worth the money."
1,Disappointing,"May be fine for very light jobs but will not handle any ""real"" projects. Replacement tools are very expensive and will not handle construction projects. This is more of a ""hobby"" tool. I was very disappointed."
4,KILLER,When i first got this album i listend to it once and thought its not that great but when you listen to it a couple of times it gets better this is one sick and gory album thats why i like it Visit www.necrohiphop.com
5,These People don't know what they are talking About,"Besides the person who titled his review, ""Simpily the Best"", are all stupid posers that don't know what they are talking about. This is Necro's best cd yet, he get's out of cd's like,""I Need Drugs"", ""Brutality"", ""Gory Dayz"" etc. All of these previous cd's are Necro classics but in my opinion they aren't as good as ""The Pre-Fix For Death"". What cd wouldn't be good with appearnces by Jamey Jasta and Sean Martin from Hatebreed.#0 of Slipknot also known as Sid Wilson etc. Necro invents his own Genre Death Rap. The best songs are Push it to the Limit featuring Jamey Jasta and Sean Martin of Hatebreed and Empoweredfeaturing Sid Wilson. If you aren't an Underground Hip-hop poserbuy this, if you are buy Nelly."
1,another pathetic attempt from Necro,"Boy, Necro once had so much potential. The beats on the first two Non-Phixion albums, his first two solo joints, and Ill Bill's album/mixtapes were insane. He was a great beatmaker and a passably decent emcee.But now he is running out of ideas and realizing that he isn't going to make it in the music industry. So rather than innovate, he puts out this violent steaming pile of refuse, a clumsy attempt to mix rock and hip-hop. Of course all the &*%#-riders are going to wax about how thugged out this music is, but in reality, Necro is just a depressed, self-loathing selfish dust-head with nothing to say. That was fine on his first two albums, but it's no longer funny or cute. It's pathetic.Psycho-Logical is a sinking ship...and the captain Necro is steering his team toward the iceberg. Ill Bill should jump before he drowns with the rest of the jokers on this label."
1,Total Trash,"I can't believe how disappointed I was in this book! The mystery was so predictable, the characters cardboard cut-outs, and the dialogue really cliched. What a joke!"
5,Perfect for travel,This is the perfect size for travel and heats up very quickly. I highly reccomend it.
3,"It works, but doesn't last.","This kettle is alright. I purchased it when I was living in an efficiency that had a single burner - I wanted a quick way to boil water for tea. For the first couple of months, it did just that.The switch is poorly designed. Even when it was new, it was often difficult to get the switch to stay in the ""on"" position. Steam leaks from the lid when you're pouring, and I've also had water leak around the base. Nonetheless, I continued to use the kettle because it DID boil water quickly.Recently, though, it's stopped working. The switch does not stay in the ""on"" position, and when I DO get it to stay, it does not heat. The kettle is not that old, and has been used as directed. For the price, you can get another small kettle that will last longer."
4,"A sweet, little kettle for the price","The Bodum 5410-03USA Mini Ibis Electric Water Kettle does everything it is supposed to do and quickly. I keep a gallon container of spring water under my desk and no longer make frequent trips to the kitchen to boil water in the microwave. My only complaint is that the steam leaks from underneath the cover, which is very close to the handle. The first time I used the kettle, I burned my hand, but grip the handle a little lower now.Otherwise, the design is good, spare, and the cord is adequately long (though I wish they'd develop a cordless version). I see no problem with the cover. I suppose, as another reviewer mentioned, that one could let it fall into the carafe, but it is easy enough to avoid doing so; it *does* have a locking mechanism, after all."
5,White Mini Electric Kettle,I'd used these kinds of kettles when traveling abroad. Usually hotel rooms in the U.K. and Asia have these instead of coffee pots. The water boils very quickly and the entire unit is cool to the touch. This one is the perfect size for a couple or where space is limited. It also comes in a larger model. Water boils very quickly. No need to fire-up the stove or microwave.
1,Wore out too fast!,"The kettle is cute and convenient for workplace-cube use by one person. However, I just got this a couple of months ago, and the nickel plating is already wearing off the element, exposing some nasty looking corrosion and leaving chunks of metal in my water! This can't be healthy."
1,This lasted for six uses - and I carted it to Europe with me!,"I bought this with some trepidation, having read the reviews that stated the kettle would only last a few months. However, I liked that it had a European plug with an American adaptor, as I was purchasing it for travel. I love my tea before bedtime and I knew there wouldn't be microwaves in the budget rooms I'd booked! I used it about four times at home to ensure I knew how it operated and packed it up and took it to Turkey. It worked there the first two nights. The third night I plugged it in prior to putting water in and there was a poof of steam and voila - the death of the Bodum. I am not advocating turning on a device without water, but isn't that what the automatic turnoffs are supposed to be for??? So here am I online searching for a more reliable product...."
3,Great at the beginning,Pot works well at first but the connection where the electrodes meet to base the base seating mechanism shorts out. Mine lasted about 6 months with all day daily use.
2,OW OW OW OW,OW MY THUMB I JUST BURNED MY THUMB BECAUSE STEAM VENTS OUT THE BACK WHEN YOUR POUR IT WHY WAS THAT A GOOD IDEA OW OW OW...I really did just burn myself not 60 seconds ago.
1,Mine Just Didn't Work,"I followed the instructions to the letter. The kettle did not work at all. See that black switch sticking out on the right hand side below the handle? When you press that switch down, it's supposed to turn on the heating element, stay down until the water boils, and then pop up. On my unit, the switch seemed to be defective. When I pressed it down to start the heating, it kept popping up and would not stay down. The teakettle was totally incapable of heating water. I recommend this product only to those who need an unsightly [] paperweight. I exchanged it for a T-Fal (model ""78541 7-cup Vitesse High Speed Kettle""). The T-Fal works perfectly, looks a lot better, holds more, heats quickly, and easily lifts off its base to move about without its power cord. The T-Fal shows its water level. It can be filled through its spout. When you fill through the spout, it filters your water. I cannot imagine an electric teakettle better than the T-Fal."
1,Something wrong with a water kettle that can't get even a little wet,"I bought this less than a year ago. I loved it at first...really heats quickly. However, I found the plastic difficult to keep clean and when I wiped it down with a damp sponge, it shorted out the switch. I expected better from Bodum."
2,Didn't last-switch died,"Great during the 6 months it worked. Boiled about 3-4 cups of water pretty fast (about 1 cup per min). BUT after 6 months the 'on' switch started flicking back up whenever we tried to switch it on, and now it doesn't work at all. Very frustrating!!!And now I'm shopping for a replacement!"
5,Great cheap electric kettle,"I've used one of these for almost a year now and I find it perfect for my needs. Heats up a big mugful of water nice and quick, and that's all I need. It has been very reliable.I suppose if I tried to use it many times in a row without letting it cool down, it might have problems as others here have described, but by the time I'm finished drinking a big cup of tea, and am ready for more, it's ready for service. The manual does say it can be switched on as soon as the thermal elements have cooled, but in defense of these other customers, that doesn't clearly give an idea of how long one should wait.Anyway, I'm very happy with mine and wouldn't hesitate to suggest this product to others."
1,Hazardous glitz! No biz...,"1. Cute design, yes.2. Small footprint, yes.3. Faulty design: lid may fall in because it's oval, not circular like man-holes; steam leaks because it has no steam guard.4. Longevity short: yes. My unit lasted 1 yr and the shutoff failed to switch it off with consequent fire hazard.I wouldn't risk again to burn my fingers or my house."
5,"Bodum = best inexpensive, corded kettle","I have used the Bodum electric kettle for travel for years, but decided I'd (foolishly) purchase a Proctor Silex for the office since it was a few bucks cheaper. That was a big mistake. Despite boiling and dumping out the water a half-dozen times, the water itself from the Proctor Silex STILL tasted strongly of plastic. Ick. Also, I found the general shape difficult to handle, the lid was hard to open, and when gently pouring the water it consistently (and dangerously) sloshed out the sides near the spout.Anyway, I ended up giving the Proctor Silex one away and buying an additional Bodum electric kettle for the office. It's working great, just like the 10-year-old Bodum I take traveling. (I think it's also interesting to note that the classic, no-frills, usable design of the Bodum has remain unchanged in the past 10 years - Hey, if it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it.)"
2,Not user friendly...,"Bought this product for my elderly in laws to prevent the ""forgotten tea kettle meltdown syndrome"". The auto shut off feature is very appealing however neither one could remove or replace the lid after being shown how. I would imagine that it would be a fine water boiler for a college dorm or apartment dweller."
3,Price too good to be true!,I thought I was buying the Ibis Electric Kettle????I have bought two in the past 4-5 years.The base connection always burns out!!! Bodum refuses to replace it...so I must buy a whole new unit.I overlooked the word MINI and that is what I got.For the price I paid I thought I bought the larger model?????I must constantly fill with water and there is no visable water gauge to tell when it is low?So---until I get some more money together to buy the larger Ibis---I must work with this one.
2,made in China,"I returned this item because it was manufactured in China. I had called Amazon customer service before I ordered it and asked where it was made. I was told that since the item code had USA in it, that indicated it was made in the USA. I do not ingest anything that comes in contact with any product made in China. Therefore I returned the tea kettle."
1,not what I expected - I returned this.,"I ordered the item, thinking it was a replacement but when I received it, it was not the right item (or size) I returned it and have already received notice of its return. I am pleased with how Amazon handled this.Thank you."
2,LAME doesn't cover it!,"I'm not really a fan of ""over the top"" gore or ""blood squirting everywhere everyone's gonna die whether they want to or not"" kinds of ""horror"" films. I can't even remember if I was actually even startled... much less ""frightened""... yawn................. Alexis Texas is kind of cute but not enough to watch the movie again!"
3,Funny zombie mutant romp,BLZ was a goofball Zombie flick.... some funny scenes... a few cool zombie kills.Would make a great Drinking game or frat house movie.
2,There's better books for the money,"Bonnie Kosanke can't very well pan her hubby's book, so I will! Seriously, the book has some good articles- But you could buy a copy of Alexander Hardt's Pyrotechnics for that ammount of money and have a better book if you're only buying one pyrotechnics book this year."
3,new safety features are a hassle,"The new ""Safety Features"" on the DFP-7BC model make it awkward to use. The motor works well once you get the items into the processor. The problem is that the ""pusher"" part doesn't come all the way out of the ""feed tube"". You have to take the lid completely off any time you want to add more food. I was disappointed at the poor design of this product. This is not what I expected from Cuisanart. I took it back and got the DLC5BC which still holds 7 cups but doesn't have the dorky inconvenience features."
2,Beware:,"Although the motor is great. I wind up having to manually hold the top down to make a connection for the blades to activate. Just impossible and defeats the purpose of having ""a second pair of hands"" i.e. a food processor."
1,Worked ok - until it died on me,"I thought this was a great food processor - until one day I put my lettuce in the feed tube, pressed the pulse button, and nothing - dead. It comes with a warranty, but I've tried to call the Cuisinart number and I get a busy signal every time. I have only had the thing for less than 4 months. I would never recomend this product to anyone, nor will I buy from Cuisinart again."
1,What Has Cuisinart Done?,"I was the first my neighborhood to buy a Cuisinart 30 years ago. It served me very very well for all these years. Time to get a new one so I purchased this model. It was impossible to clean, very difficult to use, and died after 3 uses. Save yourself some grief."
1,A terrible version,"I have either watched or owned four versions of ""Love Affair"". This one is BY FAR the worse ever produced. The film jumps in many places and the sound is imperfect. It was so bad that I stopped watching about 1/2 way through. I recommendation to anyone is to NOT buy this horrible version of ""Love Affair"". One really odd thing about the cover is the leads are not named. Four people who hold minor roles in ""Love Affair"" are listed. In addition, no mention is made of any of the actors in ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"". I did not watch ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" and can not say anything about that. If you want that film I would suggest that you buy it on a DVD not produced by Marengo Films."
4,neat but short,I love the National Geographic videos and wanted to buy some before they are to scarce on tape. This one was a nice one to enjoy with the family but it seems the films with the most fun are features on animals.
4,Better than I expected!,"I read this book thinking that it would be just ok, but it was really better than I thought it would be. Touching and sweet, its gave me a glimpse of the plight of the Navajo Native Americans that I didn't have before. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read romance novels with Native American characters, anyone interested in Navajo history, or anyone who wants a quick read."
5,Touchingly Emotional!,"NAVAJO SUNRISE is a deeply moving tale about finding love during the worst of times. Although the plot is anything but uplifting, it's wonderfully written and delicately told and it stirs the soul. Definitely a 5 star read!"
5,A Perceptive Survey of Asia in Transition,"Ian Buruma's lively writing style, familiar to readers of the New York Review of Books and the Far Eastern Economic Review, comes to the fore in this wonderful look at a variety of Asian countries. He manages to isolate scenes and trends that characterize the tension between the traditional and the modern in several Asian nations (or indeed nations in formation). The non-Asian writer on Asia is at times less forgiving, and at others brings a fresh view, but always provides insights that few other books or writers seem to produce. God's Dust lets the seasoned Asia dweller feel that she is developing her own unique perspective on life in Asia, and at the same time gives those who have never experienced Asia's intricacies and contradictions an opportunity to experience more than a travelogue or a soon-to-be-proven-wrong business trends bestseller would deliver."
1,Terrible colors,"The entire graphic turned out dark green, with no discernable difference in the blacks, whites, and greens in this picture. Couldn't even tell what the graphic on the tee was supposed to be. Contacted seller 5 times--no response."
4,How could I ask for anything else?,"This is a Tool poster featuring creepy pictures of the band members. You can see what it looks like before you buy it, so how could you complain about it? Only way I would give it 5* is if it came with a hidden $10 bill."
5,TOOL fans - a must from The Undertow artwork on the inside of the book,"Amazing old-school ""Undertow"" artwork. Completely brutal as well as trippy in a beautiful darkness theme."
3,Good recording,But when I compare the Haitink to Bryden Thomson's I give the Thomson 5 Stars.In fact Thomson has the best overall RVW set over all other recordings. I say overall as Stokowski and Mitropoulos in the 4 and 6th offer super high exctiement. Yet Thomson competes with both.Paulpaulfbest@cox.net
3,"Some good, some bad.","Four or five of the tunes on this cd are good--such as ""The Boys are on Parade,"" ""You Wouldn't Believe it's True,"" ""Gladiators,"" and maybe ""Born in Carrickfergus."" But other than these, the others are rather lacking. Some of the others I always skip. ""The Highwayman"" stinks. The others aren't memorable in the least. However, although it isn't exactly the best cd I've gotten before, a couple of these songs are of good quality. If you want to have a cd to play in the background, this would be good, but if you want real good quality cds, perhaps try Old Blind Dogs, Silly Wizard, and some of the Battlefield Band's cds."
1,The Wedding - Danielle Steel,"I was very dissapointed with this book, but not surprise. The last 3 books by Mrs. Steel have all been very boring, there is nothing to make you want to read and read, she does not grab you anymore. Her books read like they have been written as a mass production, something she just does because a contract or deadline. I do not recomend this book neither the last 3 books she wrote. I give her 1 star."
2,"Same plot, different names.","I quit reading Danielle Steele a long time ago, when her books became too much alike. The last good book I think she wrote was ""Crossings"". Anyway, I read this one, because I heard it was so-o-o good. I disagree. Once again, we have a ""beautiful"" woman in a bad relationship, who meets her Prince Charming. It's always, all too perfect. Always beautiful friends, family, lots of money. It was ok for a rainy day. I am just glad I got it from the Library and did not buy it. I miss the Danille Steel of old."
1,This is definitely not her best work.,"I have been reading books written by Danielle Steel for about 25 years now. Her first books seemed to have more developed characters and were more complex with a good story line. This book, like her others, is about beautiful, rich, people but it is very blah. The word ""and"" is used so many times it becomes almost comical. It reminds me of developing writers, always adding details with ands. I didn't even finish this book. It definitely lets your mind wander while reading. I found this book lacking in all areas."
4,Quite enjoyable to read,The wedding was an enjoyable book to read. I've always enjoyed Dannielle Steele and this one didn't disappoint.I considered it light reading which is what I'm into.
2,Boring story and annoying characters,"I read most of DS books and like many of them but Wedding is not one of the her best work. Story is so incredibly trite and boring. I couldn't stand main character Allegra who is so weak and whiny and has so many issues that would make your head spin. And most of them, she created herself, I might add. Her father hated and abandoned her, told her how she wasn't his dauther anymore because he was an ass and Allegra still feel obligation to have him walk her down the aisle? Geez, I just wanted to throw up. All the bad things that happened, I could see coming from a mile away-her stepfather's affair, her fiance's mother issues, her own insecurities, all very predictable.Her relationship with Jeff was described endlessly until I was flipping pages-yes, he was great and he loves her and we all know how much they love each other, can we move on please to something else?If you are DSteel fan, you maybe dissapointed with this book. I know I was."
4,"Nice, short, easy read!","This book was a great book! It is a nice, short read that you can read in a few days or a week. It is a heartwarming story that leaves you with a warm feeling. It isn't a book you will remember for 10-20 years, but wonderful while your in it. I would reccomend to any women that loves a warm story."
2,Awful book,"I thought that this book was one of her worst. Danielle Steel's character Allegra was awful. She was judgemental and narrow-minded. I think that Jeff's mother wasn't portrayed well at all. Instead of thinking of all that his mother had been through, Allegra could only think about herself and all that his mother had put Her through. It seemed that Allegra was also selfish and she blamed Jeff for their one fight which most married couples have before their wedding. I don't understand what Jeff saw in her at all. She also seemed to think of the wedding as more of a burden than the happiest day of her life. I can understand the stress yet Allegra seemed to think the wedding was more of a nuisance than anything. The book didn't go into depth at times and seemed to move slowly. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Her most boring book,"I am a real Steel fan but this was the most boring, name dropping book of all her books. My thoughts were that now that she runs in wealthy circles, she has to name drop. I know that she writes about what she is experiencing a lot of the times but I thought this was excessively needless and did not add to the book. There are other authors who do that and a few with panache but it really stopped the flow of the story for me. Hope the next is back to her old form."
2,The Wedding,I have read most of Danielle Steels books and usually can't put them down. I was disappointed with this one. She kept repeating the same things over and over again as if she expected us to forget and there was not much depth to any of the characters. Her books usually make me feel like I am part of the characters and I laugh and cry with them. This book did not cause me to feel that way. I would not recommend this book to my friends. My mother-in-law also read this book and agreed with me. This is not one on Danielle Steels' better books.
4,from hollywood to the jungle,"A friend had recommended this book. I borrowed her copy, brought it to the Costa Rican jungle while on vacation, and discovered they already had a copy in their three-shelf ""library"", much to my surprise!This was an excellent source of distraction and amusement. Steele does an excellent job in transporting the reader to snowy New York, the Golden Globes and Malibu, not to mention the quick trip to Las Vegas.The main character, Allegra, is strong and weak at the same time and evokes the reader to be her cheering section when life becomes arduous."
2,Not One of Danielle Steel's Better Novels,"I didn't like this DS novel very much. I know this is fiction, but why should a woman, abandoned by her birth father, then allow the bum to co-walk her down the aisle on her wedding day with the stepfather who raised her? The plot twists and angles that sent the character in this direction were less than convincing.Also, the plot filler about the troubled lives of Allegra's clients - screwed up rock stars and emotionally troubled musicians - was boring and irrelevant. I also wasn't emotionally caught up in the angst of her mother and sister, whose personal angst created plot filler but nothing particularly interesting or memorable."
4,Thanks Danielle for coming back!,"Written in a way that we know and love. I couldn't put it down; unlike Irresistable Forces, I cared about these people, you will enjoy this one!"
1,My last DS book,"I had to write a review of this book because I am appalled that writing this bad can get through the editing and publishing process. The main character Allegra was so unbelievable, I really didn't care if she got married or not. I got so tired of hearing how beautiful she was (and didn't even realize it), her body was perfect despite no exercise and eating whatever she wants. This goes the same for all the members of her family, c'mon DS let's join the real world please!!!"
1,she's repeating herself,"I really don't know why this writer keeps getting published -- I guess it's tradition. All of her stories are basically the same, set in basically the same locales, and with basically the same plot, time after time after time. I hadn't read her books in years and years, but thought there had to be something to her popularity (and her writing) that I was missing. Well...I'm still not missing a thing."
4,A true-to-life love story,"I've always loved Danielle Steel's novels and this was not an exception. What I especially love about her stories is the way she brings her characters to life.This story is very true to life - combining a wedding preparation with a real tough job.I really liked Allegra's personality and courage, the way she realized what Brandon was doing to her and how she dealt with it. She's portrayed as a human being who is in love and kidding herself about the man she loves but who, in the end, finds a man who wants to love her for the rest of her life and protect her, and that is the most beautiful thing that can happen to a person!"
1,Dime Store Trash,"I've been called a literary ""snob"" for my reading selections (Hemingway, Irving, Faulkner); So I figured I'd give this romance writer a shot before spouting off. Forget it. I've seen better writing on bathroom walls. What a shame Steele makes all the money while the real artists, artists who would die to write ""one true sentence "", who would die to keep civilization healthy, starve.Michael Fischer"
1,Most predictable book ever,"What a waste of time, you knew all along what was going to happen and the characters are all just a little too perfect to be normal and believable.Some things are totally out there... for exapmle, Allegra is woken up in the middle of the night to bail her client out of jail? Come on! Lawyers are not ethically permited to post bail for their clients. Do some research Danielle, like the rest of the authors do... don't rely on what you see on television. No lawyer would ever give out their home number, let alone answer calls in the middle of the night.And I am sick and tired of this obsession this author has with thinness. A size 10 is fat? Women like to read about characters who they can relate to and are like themselves... not the ideal woman created by the male world.Don't waste time on this book, unless you are still in high school."
5,danielle steel pulls out all the stops,"I selected The Wedding for my book club choice for the month of September.I was hesitant because some of the members had expressed that Danielle Steel is not one of their favorites.I read some of the reviews and decided this would be my selection anyway. It was a good choice.After starting to read,I could not put the book done and completed it in two days. I truly enjoyed the book and can't wait to discuss it. I was also glad that no major character met his or her death as has been know to happen and that basically there was a happy ending. I am now working on questions to lead the discussion and if there is anyone out there who can assist me it will be greatly appreciated."
4,A Definite Improvement,I love The Wedding. It was very very good. A lot of surprises and fun and full of suspense. It was a welcome change from Irrestible Forces which was a terrible book.
1,Boringest book you'll ever find,"Danielle Steel is the boringest writer I have ever encountered in my entire life. This is the very LAST book by her I'll ever read. I've given her too many chances. Not one book that I've read by her wasn't boring. I love to read, and I appreciate good books, but Danielle Steel is way overrated. She is boring, prolific, uses the same story line, and worries about quantity not quality. I have many favorite authors, but Danielle Steel is not one of them. She is the worst author ever. ALL her books are the boringest books you'll ever find. Do NOT waste your time reading this book or any of her other books. We need to quit overrating her, and quit giving her so many chances to switch from quantity to quality, and move on to better authors. There are so many good authors out there, so why waste your time on BORING Danielle Steel?"
4,This book kept me up for a few nights!,"""The Wedding"" was classic DS material. It started out VERY slllloooooowwwwwwwww and I had to wonder if I could ever finish it! But wow, after Jeff and Allegra meet it really picks up. I especially liked the storyline of Samantha and her friend. This book will be loved by all true fans of DS.Also try: Some Things That Stay and Remembering Blue"
2,Not the best,The watch does not handle moisture very well at all. The face holds condensation for weeks before it evaporates. The wand is hard to use. It's hard to change the date and/or time. It gets stuck and falls out when you try to pull it out.
4,Muy cool.,"Esta en buen precio y ademas es un buen regalo, lo unico es que parece mas grande de lo que en realidad es..."
2,this phone is driving me nuts,"Overall- this phone is ok. The voice quality is clear enough, the screen is decent for me, I like the ringtones. I don't need fancy, so it's good enough. I don't know if others have had this problem, but the one thing that I hate about this phone is that it redials in my pocket even with the phone closed and the keyguard on! As far as I can tell, the keyguard only protects the side buttons since the ""flip"" should protect the inner ones. If I'm driving or have to do something that compresses the phone a bit in my pocket, the speaker button gets pressed though it is an inner button, and if that happens twice it not only redials but turns on the speaker which broadcasts the call to everyone in listening range. I can't find any way to stop this except to use some kind of bulky holster. If I had known about this, I wouldn't have bought this phone."
5,Smooth and Enjoyable,I have liked Don ho since I visited Hawaii a number of years ago. This CD is an smooth and enoyable as I remember hearing then.
5,Alive Faye - Vol. #2TT,"This is a great collection of movies that I enjoyed when they first came out - and still think they're great. Great stories, great music and great cast. I use the word great a lot because that is just what these movies are. Great entertainment!!"
3,disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this 2nd collection of Alice Faye's movies. Alice Faye is a wonderful actress and has made many good movies, but it is apparent that at least three of these movies were added to the collection only because no one would buy them alone.On the plus side, I love the featurettes and the documentation that Fox added to these movies."
4,Inclusion of 4 Jills in a Jeep - A Joke?,"why in the world include a film in which Alice Faye is a guest star and is on screen less than five minutes with all the starring vehicles she did for Fox? It makes so little sense one suspects that the people putting these sets together are either idiots or just thumbing their nose at fans.Sally, Irene, and Mary, Wake Up and Live, Sing Baby Sing ,You Can't Have Everything with Don Ameche and the Ritz Bros. - any of these would be much more valuable releases.Too much to hope that the Fox people read these posts and realize their ""mistake"".Otherwise , this is is a great release with four terrific starring Faye vehicles long wanted by fans on dvd."
4,A few titles that were never available on VHS,"As a few others have mentioned, the inclusion of ""Four Jills in a Jeep"" is totally a misfire in this collection due to Alice Faye's 5 minute appearance. Why wasn't ""Tin Pan Alley"" included? That film was a huge hit in 1940 - and has Betty Grable! Or how about ""In Little Old New York"" with Fred MacMurray? I also want to mention that 3 out of the 5 films are available on VHS. The two that have never been available are: The Great American Broadcast and Hollywood Cavalcade. I have had bad ""taped from TV"" videos of these two films for years simply because they were never available commercially. One can only hope that by not including some of her never released to video films from the 1930s, that the big scheme (future volumes) will include some of those. I should also mention that ""Hollywood Cavalcade"" has no musical numbers."
4,Rainy day reading,"If you people out there want to learn about yourself and how to actually elevate your level of thinking, by all means buy this book along with others. Don't just sit there and read it all at once. You will not get its full potential. Read it, digest what you read, think about it. Then take another bite out of it."
3,The Amazing Laws of Cosmic Mind Power,"This book had good content contained in a lot of stories about things that happened. They left me with a good feeling.For us, Cosmic Mind Power either exists or doesn't. How it is manifest depends on our belief.This was a good read, but not as powerful as other books by Joseph Murphy. Probably the reason (just my opinion) was less chance for analysis and reflection"
2,To look for people that know of the topic.,"I believe that I should have a contact with people that know the writings of Joseph. I have read this book and the book the psychic perception. This I get rid he has helped a lot, it is very interesting but I believe to need to dialogue with people that have read it."
1,I have not put in he practices the content of the book.,"I believe that I should have a contact with people that know the writings of Joseph. I have read this book and the book the psychic perception. This I get rid he has helped a lot, it is very interesting but I believe to need to dialogue with people that have read it. I'm from Colombia, I don't speak english well. It interests me a lot the topic about the power of the imagination. I would like a lot to enter in contact with people that know of the topic and to chat with them. I want some answer a lot, I thank the attention."
5,In Life experience,"I first came across this book ten years ago in a second hand book shop in Stoke on Trent. After reading it from cover to cover, I can honestly say that it changed my life, and goes on changing it each day.The book is divided into easily digestable sections, effectively bullet-pointed at the end of each chapter.It discusses twelve ""Universal Laws"", and gives the readers examples of the affirmations used, and results obtained.In 1991, I lost my copy and only managed to track down the title in late 1997, since when my life has been transformed for the second time.If you are searching to find the strength to change your life by changing yourself from within - this may well be the only book you need buy !Mike Pendragon"
1,read the original version instead,"If you're a fan of Dr. Joseph Murphy and his wisdom, read an original copy of this book and NOT this revised edition. The original book, published in 1965, is beautifully written and timeless. Many of Murphy's books, including this one, have been ""revised"" and ""updated"" with a co-author in an attempt to appeal to a modern audience of spiritual seekers. But in his lifetime, Murphy never needed or used a ""co-author,"" as his books were (and still are) perfect just as they were originally written.Although this book is 40 years old, it doesn't need to be revised or changed in any way. Dr. Murphy had a beautiful and unique way of expressing his wisdom. These revised editions are watered-down and lack the original flavor. They are essentially no different than any other modern self-help book. Read the original instead!"
4,Are you ready to change your life?,"I have read three books from this author. About a year ago, I came across with a book ""The Power of Your Subconscious Mind"". Everafter I have been interested in Joseph Murphy's books. Joseph Murphy explains you some of the most amazing laws of cosmic mind power that will help you on your path to success. He has written carefully 15 chapters on some of the most profound areas of the life.It has been my dream to move to the States, and become a police officer there. I believe that Joseph Murphy's books will help me to achieve my goals, and help others to help themselves.I promise that this book will reveal a whole ""new you"" to you. However, I gave it only 4 stars as something is missing from this book. It is simple, and a reader who is looking for very advanced hints won't find many of them. This book is a good and basic resource for creating success.. but I would still recommend you to read to read The Powermind System and Power Pause.I wish you the best success!"
5,The Amazing Laws of Cosmic Mind Power,I purchased this book over 25 years ago and it is still very helpful to this day.It seems to speak to you personally and gives you the added encouragement you may need at the time to go on and through any difficulty.This book is easy to read and understand.It's for everyone. Enjoy!
5,Works like it should!,"Great price for an AC Adapter. I've gone through 2 or three spare chargers for my R3000, that's what happens during heavy use and lots of transporting on planes, etc. This charger was a great low price option to spending the big bucks on one directly from HP. Works just like it should, perfect."
4,New Drug EP Kicks ASS!!,"This is a band that I saw play in London at the Nottinghill Arts Club. They were amazing to say the least. This EP is really good, but doesn't do the band justice. It was recorded as rough demos in their living room, but still manages to rock. New Drug is an amazing song that opens with a strokes like riff before going completely heavy in the chorus. ""Over the edge"" is a lesson in American rock -n- roll, with a killer hook. And...the beauty of ""half a world away"" cannot be put into words. The vocals are exceptional, the musicianship as good as any band out there. I just can't wait to hear the final album versions recorded in a real studio. Although there is room for improvement on the production side....this band is ready to soar to the next level. If you like Muse, Radiohead, and Ours you will love Luna Halo."
3,Reads as if written by a lovelorn groupie,"Although this book reads painfully as if it were written by a lovelorn groupie, it does offer some good recommendations for the use of the remedies. Since the tone of the author is so adoring and sickly sweet, with a relentless he-can-do-no-wrong motif, when talking about her subject, I would have to think twice before giving credence to this ""biography"". Not even Mother Teresa was this saintly...I would recommend it for the valuable remedy and application references, of which there are enough, in my opinion, to validate the purchase of this little book.As a biography, I would possibly consider it as such, but only in a very superficial sense: perhaps timelines and places. Otherwise, my skepticism takes hold and questions."
1,Yikes!,"This product didn't work exceptionally well, and quite honestly, the fishy odor that it has is horrendous. Wouldn't recommend."
5,Fabulous Fudge,I am so amazed at the variety and flavors Fun Flavor Fudge offers. I order frequently and try different flavors. There has not been one that I have tried that isn't the best fudge I have ever eaten. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to try something out of the ordinary. Best fudge I have ever eaten and will continue to try more flavors. Since there are so many flavors I guess I will be buying fudge from them forever. The fudge is smooth and flavorful and not the hard paraffin wax fudge that has a shelf life of 10 years. When serving guest this not only has a nice presentation but also provides good conversation on the varieties offered. It is truly Fabulous Fudge.
5,Kids love it!,"We gave this to our three year old for Christmas and he and his seven year old brother are watching it for the 2nd time this morning. We are already big Disney fans and they love watching the TV show, so it's no surprise that this movie is a big hit!"
5,Disney Playhouse DVD,"My 17 month old grandson loved this DVD. He loved the music, and the characters, especially Pete!"
4,Great DVD,My 3 yr old son loves Mickey and I knew he wanted this DVD. It was a perfect Christmas gift.
4,"Good, but pricey","Our kids love this episode so we finally broke down and bought it. The good is that it is essentially a combined episode of back-to-back episodes to tallying almost 60 minutes. It definitely is pricey for what it is though, that's why 4 instead if 5 stars."
5,Thanks,"bought for my grandsons for christmas. they they will like it as they in very ""into"" mickey these days! great price"
5,Train CRAZY!!!,"My two year old son is train crazy, and he also enjoys Mickey Mouse, so this dvd is perfect! Not super, super long, but my son gets so excited over it, that doesn't even matter! Perfect fot the train crazy child in your life!"
5,Awesome!,My grand daughter 2 loves this. It is adorable and fun to watch with her. Learning shapes is fun too!
5,"High Quality, Good Price","This tubing is a great product for how relatively cheap it is. I used it to make prop glasses that needed zigzag arms, and this tubing not only bent the way I needed it to, but it also held that shape with more strength than I was expecting. I know it's not the intended use of this product, but I was very impressed nonetheless."
4,A good reference on a little documented subject,"I thought that this was one of Osprey's better books in the ""Warrior"" series. Some excellent information on unit structure and the various unifroms worn by the Japanese soldiers of this period that is hard to come by in english language references. A previous reviewer criticized the book for spending too much time on the ""minutia"" of Japanese military uniforms and not enough on tactics. This is, however, akin to complaining that an apple does not taste like an orange; these books are not meant to discuss tactics or campaigns, but are intended to focus on the ""minutia"" of uniforms and personal equipment. The brief format does not really allow the subject matter to range too far. Anyone interested in more information on Japanese tactics in WW2 should consider some of the excellent Osprey ""Campaign"" series of books, including ones on Iwo Jima and Peleilui."
2,Ok for basics but simply insufficient,"I studied this text for an introductory course on the philosophy of language at ANU. While it is case that this text is somewhat comprehensive and reasonably well written, it is simply much much too brief in its accounts to be a worthwhile purchase. When it came time to write my essays, this text gave me the basic idea but i couldnt rely on it to provide the desired depth and substance needed to have a hope of writing an HD essay. I would suggest that your better off buying a text that does not try to cover so much territory in such a short space. there are massive wholes in some of the theoretical descriptions. for example, when it comes to Grice's analysis of sentence meaning, his account is tantamount to saying ""this is too complicated and i dont really understand it so i wont cover it"" - he therefore only provides half of the story of the analysis of meaning through intention.In short this text was disappointing!"
3,Typical Philosophy book,Just buyin the book for a class. Very easy to read and understand but the author adds his views. Quite frankly I just care what the major philosophers had to say. He does a great job showing what they mean using examples and his interpretation though.
3,"low-level aspiring mobster, in New Jersey no less","This is a pretty good, sad film about a young tough on the make. He wants to move up in the mob, but proves too hot headed and prone to bad mistakes, making enemies and messing up longstanding set-ups. It is pretty much a downward spiral that is well acted, if banal. Joe Pesci appears in it as a bit player and is very good, which makes the film worth watching for film buffs. This is real nickel and dime crime, for all I know realistic, though there is nothing too notable about the film.Recommended."
4,A true giant of Salsa's triumphant return to the top.,"If it's true that this 1973 release broke no new ground for Charlie Palmieri, then it's also true that it proves once again just how immensely talented and innovative a pianist and musician he was. Produced by Joe Cain and featuring the smooth-voiced Vitin Aviles on lead vocals, this album spawned the major hits ""La Vecina"", ""Despierta Julian"" and ""El Cantante Del Amor"". Perhaps reflecting the fact that Alegre Records' days as an autonomous label were numbered (the label would be sold to Jerry Masucci's Fania empire in 1976), ""Vuelve El Gigante"" did not sell as well as its immediate predecessor (1972's superb ""El Gigante Del Teclado"") but it's nonetheless an album very much well worth getting."
2,Mobile Data 3-in-1 USB Travel Kit for Palm Treo 650,"I'm not very satisfied with this kit. Good price, but the quality is quite low. After about 6 weeks the connector covers started separating every time I plug it in, causing a portion of the connector to separate and be unable to connect to the telephone, so I have to hold it ""just so"" every time I plug it in, and be careful not to move the telephone or it will lose unplug."
1,Should Have Listened,I should have listened to the reviews on this item. I decided to buy it anyway and what a disapointment it was. It never worked and the connection to the TREO was horrible. I have learned a lesson about after market products and will not be buying products from these companies to save a few dollars.
1,It broke within hours,I used it 3 times and one of the prongs broke off in my phone - luckily I was able to remove it w/o damaging my Treo.Great concept - fewer cords; too bad it was made of inferior materials.
1,Not worth $1...,I bought this thinking it would be perfect for what I wanted.The wall adapter dosn't work at all and the end of the cable that plugs into the phone has slowly been chipping away to the point that it is now impossible to plug it correctly into the phone. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1,Don't waste your money or time,Nice concept poor quality. The item broke after two days of limited use. The metal tabs on the Palm connection block were not firmly seccured in the plastic terminal housing and as a result they disapreared into the housing when connected to the phone. This caused the phone to not charge because the power tabs were not making contact.Don't waste your $15.00 on this cheaply made poor performing product.
3,"Is there a way to ""sync"" using this kit?","I have purchased this kit based on several recommendations here. However, I have not figured out how to ""hot sync"" to my PC using this kit. Is there a way to sync using this kit? Thanks for any feedback!"
5,This does it all,"This is the only additional power source you will need for the Treo 650. It does it all, 100v AC, 12 v DC, and USB all in a tidy package."
1,I would give it 0 Stars but it is not possible.,"After I received it I plugged it into the car and 10 minutes after it stopped working. There is comething completely wrong with the connector that it does not make a good contact. A piece of junk. I travel a lot, 50-60% of the time and thought this was my salvation.I wasted $16 in the most miserable way.I can't return it because I am traveling in South America and by the time I return I won't be able to return it.Do not buy it."
1,do NOT purchase this...,"I was looking for something practical and small enough to take with me on bussiness travel. It worked for four days. After that something got loose inside the connector. On my recent trip to Vancouver, I had to purchase an extra charger at the Dallas Airport, as this unit just simply did not work at all. I though it had damaged the phone, but the phone was perfect. If i were you, I rather go PALM accessories. This Mobile Data 3-in1 USB Charger/syncro cable is really BAD quality."
1,Doesn't work at all. Piece of junk.,"Not sure why I though I'd have any better luck than others, but I guess I thought it was worth a try for the price. I was wrong. I agree with most of the posters that this is a piece of junk. Amazon should stop selling it."
1,worthless to me,"usb doesnt work, wont charge or sync.also doesnt charge with wall adapter. the cable is just totally bad.not worth my time to send it back, and it looks like out of stock now anyway. bummer."
1,Charges but no Hotsync,My first unit failed to charge or hotsync with my computer while using the USB. I did a return with Amazon and got a replacement unit. This one would charge using the USB but still won't hotsync. I would call this product a POS and recommend you to save your money. Judging from the other reviewers the quality is hit or miss but with two tries and no success I would give this product 0 stars if possible.
1,Travel kit leaves you stranded,"Great, except a prong on power cord, where in plugs into the Treo, somehow broke off and left me stranded without power. Lucky that I had a spare battery or I would be at a 2 day conference without phone or email."
1,"The thought is nice, but product quality is poor","The idea of less cables is great, the price fabulous. However, I went through two cords trying to get good contact with my phone. It rarely would signal it was charging, and would lose contact soonafter so I would be driving with both hands on the phone trying to initiate the charge. I felt as if I was going to ruin my phone by jamming it in harder or at a different angle. Not worth it! I am returning both cables and just paid the bigger bucks to purchase two separate cords from the Sprint store itself. (These new cords worked perfectly)"
1,Poor Quality,The idea sounds great but the product was made poorly and connection is poor. I returned the product since it won't be of any use if it doesnt work
1,I should have read the reviews before ordering this...,I just received this product yesterday (5/18). A good idea badly executed. My Treo 650 can't sync with my computer using this cable. I'll probably wind up buying an extra charger and HotSync cable from PalmOne. I am returning this thing.
5,Works well on my Treo 650,And the price is so much nicer than buying everything separately and paying over $100.
1,Bad Product,The data cable was faulty and never worked. Neither did it work when connected to the car charger and also when connected to the AC wall plug.I am very dissapointed that the quality of this product is so low.
1,Do not buy this item,I am not sure if it is the vendor or the item itself. Please be carefull. It did not work for me and the vendor did not help also. If you are prepared to waste the money go right ahead
2,Where Did Laurence Shames Go?,"The Naked Detective is a decent book to read if you have never read any previous books by Laurence Shames. If you are a follower of LS (as I am), this book is marginal at best. The characters just seemed to exist. I never fell in love with any other them, except for the tennis playing cab driver. The first chapter or two was written in his usual entertaining style, but then something went very wrong. Laurence Shames seemed to disappear. I hope that ""The Naked Detective"" is not a preview for his future works. I will patiently await LS's next book in the hope that he will once again write as brilliantly as he did in his other books."
2,The Naked Detective,"The book reminded me of a Woody Allen line about life. Two women were complaining about a restaurant - ""the food was terrible...and such small portions.""Although Laurence Shames is one of my favorite authors (especially Scavenger Reef), I was dsappointed by the book. When it arrived I was surprised at how short it was. As I read it, I found it hard to care about Pete Amsterdam. The whole reluctant detective theme didn't work for me. The other characters were all familiar that we have seen in John MacDonald, Carl Hiaasen and Tom Corcoran. I am not drawing comparisons to these three authors (certainly the best in this genre) as that would be unfair. I will still look forward to Shames' next book when he will hopefully get back on track."
3,"A solid book, but not outstanding","I do enjoy a good reluctant detective story, and I like the way this one was set up. I can actually see such a thing happening, people do stranger things to dodge taxes. And despite his lazy demeanor and womanizing ways, I rather liked the main character. The plot was a bit on the thin side, a few of the other characters a bit overly dramatic, but it pulled together into a good lazy Sunday sort of read. Nothing too thought-provoking, nothing too amazing, just decent writing and a nice-paced mystery."
3,Still the Best,"My wife knows the routine when I'm reading Lawrence Shames. I'm constantly sayng, ""Listen to how he says this!"" then I read her the latest gem. But not so much this time. This novel is good fun, but I didn't find the amazing choices of words I've come to expect, the pleasing metaphors, similes, and humor of, say, ""Scavenger Reef."" But that's OK. Shames is stll the best of the Florida genre even in this latest offering---but it's a genre he usually transcends."
3,"Okay, but not great.","This was a good read, but lacked the zaniness of earlier Shames books. Not up to his usual standards. It seemed tired and formulaic."
3,"Not Awful, Not Special, Just OK.","The reluctant hero gets a whole twist in this lightweight Key West romp, in which retired 47-year old Pete Amsterdam is dragged from the comforts of his hot tub, wine cellar, and regular tennis game by a bartender hiding out from a local Mafia type. Pete is technically a detective, but only on the advice of his accountant, who was looking for a way to write off the wine cellar as a business expense. In this homage to (or spoof of?) classic detective tales, Pete is soon embroiled in a number of PI tropes, a sexy femme fatale, a mysterious missing package everyone's looking for, and a dame he's not sure he can trust. For the first half it's a pretty fun little romp, moving quickly along. Somewhere around the middle though, things started to bog down a little and drag, but it's still decent beach reading. As with other Florida writers like Carl Hiassen, there's some clear criticism of South Florida development as well. Not awful, but not special."
3,A very different Laurence Shames. A 3 and 1/2.,"I am a big fan of Laurence Shames and his Key West capers with many a colorful character. The high dose of humor his stories usually contain is a huge selling point. Like Woody Allen, I enjoy Laurence Shames when he's funny.There is scant humor in ""The Naked Detective"", so it ranks low on my personal likeability meter. However, it is a strong noirish short novel. As usual the Key West descriptions are so vivid you can taste the salty air, get burned by the sun and feel the dampness of the humidity. The scenes are brilliantly set. The action is a bit uneven; nonstop at times, followed by lulls.The whodunit is a clever twist and the ""Maltese Falcon like"" buried treasure's identity is kept from the reader until the end. Neither is easily telegraphed, so you have plenty of time to play guessing games and solve the mystery."
2,Not very convincing,"I bought this camera and my first impression was good. But when I started shooting pictures it changed inmediately. The flash doesn't work constantly (when it's on like it should) just whenever it wants to, the pictures turn to be all dark and blurry except when you take them out in the sunlight. The photo quality is very poor. So I would not recommend this camera for shooting outer pictures. For a web cam is ok. It works but it also needs a lot of light arround so you can see yourself clearly. I consider this product a loss of money but if you want to try it, go ahead, prove it by yourself."
2,Quality questionable,"Areas of the figure have low quality, does not look very realistic. Some scuff marks on helmet and body of figure."
3,Beautiful but unbalanced,"My dear readers:Great detail in the armor suit, good finishes and beautiful to look but unfortunately the model is off balance, leaning backwards because of the weight of the resin cape. There's also some minor assembling part problems. I resolved the balance problem with a black metal bookstand and the same holding cables that the model brought positioned on the back of the cape."
5,It was what I wanted,"It's a awesome manga, I like this kind of manga it came in good conditions, I recommend this manga to someone that saw the anime and want to know the complete story."
4,Guts gains focus,"Our hero has been dragged along by fate and has lived in the shadow of Griffith's dream. Through his pleasing interlude with Caska and a very drawn out sword battle, he becomes his own man. In this story of dreams, I can see this will be a major plot point.The story is building nicely toward the Hawks victory and undoubted crushing by the demon's fate."
5,"Essential and entertaining reading about Sondheim's career through ""Into the Woods""","This book is an excellent achievement for the writer, Craig Zadan, and a thoroughly entertaining and absorbing experience for the reader. Stephen Sondheim, to his credit, remains an ever-enigmatic figure at the end of the book as he is at the beginning. What you do comprehend by the end of the book is how brilliant Sondheim is, and how unique! Reading about his shows will make you want to purchase all of the cast recordings if you don't have them already."
4,Nice island feel,The classic Hawaiian island music beats. I love it. Lots of catchy songs. Makes me feel like i'm back home with the ohana.
5,Lupin Does It Again!,"Another great set of episodes from Lupin III. These 5 episodes have also not been shown on US television, so you should get the DVD just for that, but there are other great reasons for getting it. In one episode, Jigen and Goemon infiltrate two crime groups to help Lupin steal a royal crown. One episode has Lupin and the gang chasing a group of strange gorillas. One episode, titled ""But Your Brother Was Such a Nice Guy,"" where Lupin gets caught with vampires, might be a little offensive for the overly religious, but it's just a cartoon, so no offense. Great set of episodes. Also, you might want to pick up Castle of Cagliostro if you haven't already done so, because it's a great movie."
4,Good classic anime Tv series,I loved this show based in the comic books of Monkey Punch.It follows the adventures of master thief Lupin the Third nephew of the French Arsene Lupin and his gang composed by Goemon Ishikawa a master samurai and Deitsuke Jigen a cold blooded gunman.Sometimes joins to the band Fujiko Mine a bussom beautiful lady expert in conning and also thieving.Where the most valuable or expensive treasure or antique is Lupin the Third and his gang trying to rob it.The Dvd has 5 episodes that are in order as they originally broadcasted with the preview and even the commercials break.The series are well translated and the voices of the dubbers are quite similar to original japanese.The only flaw in this Dvd is that the English subtitles are the translation of the Japanese version not the English dubbed version.Sound and picture quality are more than average.I will wait for next volume.
5,such wonderful insight,"I started reading this book because a pastor friend of mine had suggested it to me when I inquired about a good book on the cross. I have to say that this book has truly revolutionized my understanding of Christ's sacrifice on my behalf, and what the cross really means. There is hardly one page in the book that I have not underlined and written in the margins. I wholeheartedly recommend Martyn Lloyd-Jones' book ""The Cross"" for all those who want a deeper understanding of this most crucial matter. I also recommend ""The Cross of Christ"" By John Stott for further study. God be with you."
3,The first Flash 5 book,"This is a decent book with concise, straight forward explanations of the features of Flash 5. It isn't, however, very comprehensive or detailed.Question? Should I buy this book because it is first or should I wait for other books? . . . I believe the answer to this question depends upon your experience with Flash.If you just bought the program and want to start learning, you will probably be better off with a more comprehensive tutorial book (there were several for version 4 which I'm sure will be out shortly for version 5). The Quickstart Guide does have tutorials but they are very short and don't include source files (no CD--no download site).For the upgrade users. If you are an expert at version 4 there's very little in this book that you won't be able to figure out for yourself. For the intermediate users who have just upgraded this may be an excellent choice as it zooms through the program in record time!"
1,Leaves out important steps!,"Horrible book! It leaves out important steps for beginners! Example: in telling you how to do a shape tween (p. 304), it neglects to tell you to select ""create tween"", something a beginner would not know. It tells you to get a certain tool, or go to a certain window, but does not tell you where it is or how to get to it (and some are hidden quite well in Flash) This book leaves out a lot of important steps that are unique to Flash, but goes into lengthy detail about things that anyone could figure out, like how to draw a circle with the circle tool."
3,5 Degrees of Flash,"You've seen the sites, you've read the hype, now you want to get a leg-up in the world of web-based animation using Macromedia Flash. Though not intended to turn you into an MM guru overnight, this book, with its clear and concise, examples-based narrative, is an excellent way of getting your head around the fundamental aspects of this increasingly popular program. I recommend it to anyone just starting out in this field."
1,Terrible,"Don't buy this book, not only does it leave you frustrated because of the lack of explanation it also gives you no idea's on actionscripting, all you will do with this book is read over and over the steps wondering where you are going wrong because the explanations are wrong, they might as well just pasted a 5 over the old 4 books and sold it as a new one, I can't wait for the 6 version, I'm sure that will be a repackaged 4 as well !!!SAVE YOUR MONEY-get some other book!!!"
3,For beginners,"This book is for a beginner. I bought this book because I wanted a cheap book to help me learn flash. I have learned very little from this book. It goes through basic thing any normal computer person would just know.Like using a couple pages on the pencil and the line tool. I mean who doesn't know what a pencil tool or a liine tool does. This is a pretty good book for beginners, but if your intermediate in flash look for something else."
1,Nothing New,"For the life of me, I can't figure out why this book was published. Anything you want to know about overall Flash functioning was already covered in the Flash 4 Quickstart Guide. What's worse is that the Flash 5 guide doesn't focus on ActionScripting--which is the heart of the Flash 5 program. The publishers really didn't seem to bother with producing a new book. They just put a new cover on an old one. Lazy, lazy."
5,Best software book I've ever read,Ulrich does a great job of explaining the complexities of Flash--she covers the necessities and then some. Easy to read with good examples. A great book for beginners or intermediates.
3,i love my shirt,"overall, this is an inconsistent recording. i love my shirt is good for a laugh but otherwise quite terrible. some of the other songs are flat. highlights include the singles barabajagal and atlantis, to susan on the west coast waiting is probably his worst single of the period. superlungs my supergirl features some fine fuzz guitar, and trudi, with the jeff beck group is pretty good. much of the rest is pretty silly and doesn't hold up well today, if you want to buy his best record, I'd suggest you get SUNSHINE SUPERMAN."
2,The Beginning of the End,"1 great tune (Atlantis), a couple of good tunes and the rest is pretty bad. Get it if you are a completist, otherwise skip this one."
3,An inconsistent work,"This work is not as strong as ""sunshine superman"", ""mellow yellow"", ""a gift from a flower to a garden"", and ""hurdy gardy man"", it's quite inconsistent. Standouts are ""barabajagal"", ""superlung my supergirl"" and ""Atlantis""(with Jeff Beck group, yes). But others are fillers. For more pure folky sound try ""a gift from a flower to a garden"", for psychedelic gems try ""mellow yellow"". The CD remastering is poor, too. (So as ""sunshine superman"", what a pity)."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Great quality, rec'd quickly, fair price. This is the best you can get...works great with plastic or steel tip darts. I didn't know anything about dartboards & this was a gift for my husband. Based upon the description, I chose this one. He was very happy and said I made a great choice."
3,Good Price but Quality not up to Specs,The book was at a pretty low price so I guess I shouldn't complain too much but I don't believe the condition of the book was up to the quality advertised.
4,Yay!,"This book is FABULOUS! For anyone thinking of starting a meal-swapping group, this book is for you. There are tips in the beginning to help you get started, and forms in the back to use in helping to determine dietary needs, choices, etc. My mommie's group found this really helpful in transitioning from playgroup meet-up to food swap, and the recipes are wonderful! I highly recommend this book to anyone starting out with frozen meals!"
4,Not bad if you need a quick review,"If you need a quick review of all of ""Biology"" (obviously an impossible task) this is a good place to spend an hour or two."
1,If you like mold then buy these,"Sproutman is the ultimate shyster. On his website he makes claims that these will sprout ""even the mucilaginous seeds"" such as chia and flax. Once you get the bags in the mail you find a different story on the insert: ""These bags are much better suited for sprouting grains and beans."" Go ahead and try to sprout leafy sprouts with this bag and you end up with a bag of crap. They still get moldy and rancid even when you sterilize everything thoroughly. You just can't sprout the seed sprouts in these easily or efficiently. Perfect if you like to sprout already mycotoxic grains and beans, but then what's the point? Get a suitable tray or even a chia pet and you will be better off.You've been warned."
2,I'll be honest with you...,"..it doesn't work as a looka t the real Ed Gein, or as a slasher film. I only bought this because of Kane Hodder, but there is really not much offered here. If you must absolutely watch this by any means rent it only, you will save yourself the trouble and can get something better. I have nothing good to say. I gave it two stars and not one because it was bearable. I was able to at least finish it through all the way without falling asleep."
2,Waste of time.,"I'm not gonna go into detail about this movie. It's not worth taking the time to review. I feel like if I can help someone save money and valuable time it's saying a few words though. This movie very slow, it has bad acting, and terrible screenplay. The only redeeming thing about this movie is the costumes and the set design. I could never in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone."
1,Not the Gein I know,"You've heard several negative reviews about this film. I know some about the real Mr. Gein, and this is nothing like him. They created him (in the film) as a towering mass of brutality. Almost like a Jason...or Michael Myers?If you are interested in a film that depicts more of the real Ed, then try ""Ed Gein"", or ""Deranged"". However, ""Deranged"" has a B rated goofy quality to it. However, it still beats this version of Gein's life. Ed Gein Butcher of Plainfield is something you might want to watch if you have no interest in the real Gein? To be honest, I tried watching it twice. The first time ""booooo"", the second I tried approaching it in a non-judgemental way. No matter how you look at it the movie is not good :( The acting stinks, script stinks, It's boring all the way around itself. If you want an original movie (with out Gein) try ""Trick r Treat"". Best Halloween film I've seen in years. Spend your cash on that, not this.Thank you"
1,Completely horrible,"This movie was completely idiotic. It was basically a love story with Officer McStudly dating Princess Blondie with sprinkles of a very loosely based version of Ed Gein. This is not a true crime film.The woman (Adrienne Frantz) playing the female love interest was completely unbelievable in her role and I found myself disappointed at the end when she didn't get killed. She was that terrible. She delivered some sort of high pitched whiny monologue at the end about how Ed didn't have the right to decide when people died - only god did. The guy playing Ed Gein was the only believable actor portraying real emotions in the movie. As such, he was the only one you could empathize with in the film. Everyone else was one dimensional and unbelievably stupid.This isn't even a movie for people who like bad horror. I like bad horror - this was just a bad love story. If you want a good recent horror film, get Trailer Park of Terror."
2,Not true to story of Gein,"Warning may contain spoilers. Very vague spoilers ahead...When I first heard that Kane Hodder was playing Ed Gein, I became excited. I thought he would be a very scary Gein. However I was very very wrong, This movie was okay, but it was not accurate in the portrayal of Ed Gein. First off, he did not have an accomplice that helped him rob graves who he later killed because he wanted to stop. They never caught him with a live girl and the cops did not chase him through the woods and put a gun to his head, only to be talked out of shooting him by the very girl he had kidnapped. If you want a good Ed Gein movie see the one with Steve Railsback. Buy it here.Ed Gein. It ruled."
2,"Too much ""poetic license"" here","Like other reviewers, I could not accept Hodder as Ed Gein. He's just too big, strong and scary. He looks like a killer. Nothing like the real Ed Gein.I also didn't expect the gore. If you like bloody body parts movies, you might like this one--it's pretty graphic and sadistic.From what I know about Gein, he was crazy, not sadistic. He was trying to recreate his mother, not terrorize and torture other women.The real story of Ed Gein is one of sadness and insanity, not of pleasure killing and meanness. I was hoping to find out more about Gein--particularly his prior life--he doesn't fit the typical serial killer profile, but is one of the most notorious serial killers. I expected this movie would help unlock some of the mystery, and it fell really short. In fact, it added more myth than anything else."
2,Boring,"They tell little to nothing about Ed and the movie moves incredibly slow, horrible acting. It is creepy and at times some good violence but that's about it. And Kane proves why he's a stuntman and not a true actor. Serial killers like Bundy, Gacy, Gein and especially Dahmer need movies with bigger budgets and to be taken more seriously and have better stories."
3,"""TRUE CRIME""","THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON THE TRUE LIFE KILLER ""ED GEIN"".HIS CRIMES TOOK PLACE IN THE LATE 1950'S.THERE IS AN OLDER VERSION OF THIS MOVIE SIMPLY TITLED ""ED GEIN"".IT CAME OUT IN 2000.STARRING STEVE RAILSBACK AS ""ED GEIN"".AND CARRIE SNODGRESS AS HIS MOTHER.THIS REMAKE IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL.KANE HODDER DOES GIVE AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE AS ED,BUT THE MOVIE LACKS SUSPENSE.I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS VERSION.YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL THEN THIS VERSION TO GIVE YOUR OWN OPINIONS.THE STORY OF ED GEIN IS A GRAPHIC ONE.HE WAS A GRAVE ROBBER OF HUMAN FLESH,A NECROPHILLIAC,AND A SKILLED TAXIDERMIST.IN WHICH HE MADE HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTS OUT OF HIS VICTIMS.THIS REMAKE DOES HAVE GORE AND IS GRAPHIC,AS DOES THE ORIGINAL.NOT FOR THE FAINT AT HEART."
5,Mr. Men Show,"Great for kids, especially when they ask to read the books afterwards!I found the short episodes manageable for children to grasp and for adults to relive their childhoods.The Mr. Men (And Little Miss) franchise has been a great inspiration to my professional life with its childishenthusiasm and quirky characters.-Zac Stanley"
4,Great book to share your life with those you love.,"I really appreciated the opportunity this book gave me to review my own life, and record memories for those who may read it."
2,"Cute idea, but way too small","This book is about half the size of a small paperback book. My parents are in their 70s - the writing is small and the area to write on is also small. The book itself is a great idea with good questions to answer, but I will likely send it back. My parent's writing has gotten larger as they've gotten older, and I doubt it would be easy to compose anything on these pages. To be fair, I should have checked the dimensions before purchasing. Thank you."
2,Very Small!,"I did not like this product very much, due to the fact that it was alot smaller than I originally thought, the pages are just too small. Not enough room for a mother to really tell her story and leave a piece of her legacy. Does not apply to african american mothers. Have to shop for a new one!"
2,Not a lot of detailed information,"I didn't find this book to be very useful at all. It was basically a short review of general dog care focussed on city living. However all the information was very breif and didn't go into very much detail. if you really want to learn more about your dog I suggest getting a book that is more focussed on just one subject. I highly suggest the book ""Rover, Don't Roll Over"" for positive training. This book might serve someone well as a general reference, but if you have any troubles or questions that need answering or even trouble shooting don't bother with this book. I aslo didn't like their training style, it wasn't harmful, I just don't think their particular techniques work as well as in Rover, Dont Roll Over."
5,Kilcommons and Wilson have done it again.,"I thought I would like this book, and I did. I've read all of the authors' other books about dogs, and this one was right up to par. There was no resting on laurels!Metrodog is invaluable for dog-owning city dwellers, but it's equally useful for dog owners in any location. The book begins with how to find the right dog, and ends with how to say good-bye to a faithful old friend. In between it covers housebreaking, food, manners, training, socialization, exercise, and health care, with hundreds of useful details discussed with the authors' customary savvy and humor.For readers who are interested in learning how to successfully and happily share their lives with a dog, this is the book to read."
3,"Great book for hikers, bikers, and railroad enthusiasts","This book is a guide of abandoned rail lines that are now in use as trails for hiking, mountain biking, or just plain walking. Covering all of California, the trails rang in difficulty from short, smooth trails within city limits suitable for a short walk or bike ride, all the way to long distance mountain trails, for hiking and mountain biking. Great photots, and the maps and directions are very detailed. If your a hiker or mountain biker in California, or planning to take a trip here, I would recommend this guidebook."
4,Great Book,"It was great reading a book that finally addressed the cause of economics and capitalism. Economics is very fascinaing to me, and it interesting to see it applicable for the 18th century as well.Adam Smith wrote the book the same year our great nation was established. The book was very intriguing and genuinely full of good, useful economics principles.All in all, the book deserves a B+. I give it a strong B and not an A, only because of the wordage used. At times it was even above my intellect.Thanks, Raymon Perry 850-521-9647"
1,Mangoes are juicy,"As with all of her other books this one is uplifting, fun, very true, and makes you remember yourself when life tries to over-run you. Everything this woman does makes me want to have her as a best friend. She is WAY COOL.If you have not read any of her books you are missing a wonderful experience."
3,Not as advertised,"This is not a book for the novice to learn basic self defense techniques. There are only two pictures on self defense. The rest is written. You have to already know the techniques to know what he is talking about, in which case you don't need this book. It is mostly a book about Applegate's days in the O.S.S. It was advertised as a book to learn the few basic techniques needed for self defense. This is not the case."
2,Trial & Error,"Product works but only after a lot of trial and error. Some issues include:* You can not plug a turntable directly into the unit. The VU meters will indicate a signal but you can not adjust the input or record volume and the recording will be inaudible. I had to run the turn table through an old receiver and use the tape out.* The software included will prompt you that it will replace your old Nero 5 with the Nero 6 ""Suite"". What it doesn't tell you is that deletes all old Nero software and only installs the one program: Soundtrax. My Nero CD burning software was erased.* The instructions are nearly worthless as is the tech support. I only got this to work after reading reviews on Amazon.com.. I would buy something else."
2,not as easy as it sounds,"After spending hours trying to get the ADS Tech Instant Music to work, I called the ADS Tech phone line, only to get an answering machine. Frustrated, I finally took the kit and my computer to my local computer shop, where I shelled out another $45 for the guy to tell me that the audio quality through the box provided with Instant Music allowed too much static and wasn't as good as plugging the LP/cassette audio into what I already had on my computer. To their credit, the ADS Tech people eventually called back a few days later, but I doubt whether they would have been of much assistance, as they immediately referred me to the FAQ on their website, which I had already seen."
1,Doesn't Work,"First of all, there are no instructions on how to connect with the computer to transfer LP's. Secondly, the software that comes with it expires within 30 days. Thirdly, the sofware didn't work and the only way to possibly get it to work is to buy the upgrade."
1,Software Incompatible With Mac!!,"I bought the RDX-150 because the description said for PC and Mac! This is very misleading because this item includes software for PC only, Spin It Again. The Box is no good without software. Now I have to go and buy Roxio or Garage Band for Mac. What I should have ordered was the RDX-151-EF."
1,Direct turntable input will not work,"One thing they don't tell you is that this device will NOT handle direct input from a turntable. It requires a pre-amp. If you have all your stereo and computer gear in the same room, that will be okay. But if you don't (like me), forget it.There is absolutely nothing in the documentation or the ADStech Web site that tells you this. I did a search of product reviews and finally found one that said, ""Oh, by the way...""I'm not about to lug my desktop/monitor/kb/mouse to another floor every time I have a chance to record an album. And I'm certainly not going to tear apart my entertainment center to drag my sound system to the computer. This product is getting returned."
4,ADS Tech Instant Music Rocks,Just what I needed to make a great xmas gift for my family. Found an old cassette tape of an interview with my grandfather that has since departed and I needed a way to put it onto a cd.
2,Apparently has QC issues,"I've been through two of these so far, and only the first one worked, for about half an hour. It worked very well, but then suddenly relapsed into a weak, extremely noisy signal. (Yes, the source was still good.) The S/PDIF I/Os are a nifty feature, though not ones that I can currently use. The included software is an unusually irritating subset of Nero 6, and documentation of the unit itself is minimal. I know when to cut my losses. Next up: the Xitel Inport. Wish me luck."
3,"ok for a field guide, if you don't mind getting frustrated.","As an amateur watcher just wanting to know which butterflies were in my garden, I was somewhat disappointed. I spent a great deal of time trying to compare the butterfly with the poorly represented plates. The few pictures scattered through the book were better, but I found errors in the identification given for the picture and the identification given in the plate and one was even not listed on the page they gave (or no where I have yet to find). The range listed were difficult for me to know if this species was in my backyard and not every species had a range map. These errors I found in one whole afternoon while trying to identify only THREE butterflies in my garden. Some of the book I like, like some of the intro information, but I guess other books have this info also. I was frustrated."
4,good book- not great condition,"The shipping was a little slow, but it came within the time frame,had quite alot of water damage, but it was still readable so i guess thats all i needed it for. would buy from seller again."
4,Disturbing truth,"Well-written book, excellent research. Disturbing that several police departments were unable to solve the case and unwilling to share information to help bring down the killer. Disturbing that Californians apparently didn't demand better police work. Sad that Mr. Graysmith worked night and day looking for a killer while tax-paid police feigned interest but didn't join in. Sad that the SF's lead investigator blames others when he loses his job even though it was nine years and counting at that point with no one behind bars. How is it investigators get only one search warrant for a suspect with several homes? A sad and disturbing story all around."
3,There's a movie coming,A major character is based on this author. A good time to review the history of the case. This gives you the basics and a feel for the monster.
1,Graysmith might as well be the killer,"First and foremost the worst part about this book is the way Graysmith has written it. By using pseudonyms for just about everyone in the book keeping everyone straight with their real identities is nothing but a jumbled mess. And more so, its completely unneccesary now since everyone knows that Graysmith is trying to pin it on Arthur L. Allen. When they reprinted this for the movie they should have fixed this problem.Additionally, this book seems to deal more with Robert Graysmith than the Zodiac killer. I'm not saying he's the Zodiac, I just think it's more than a bit odd.Also, like so many have pointed out Graysmith plays it rather loose with the facts. Yes, this book can be entertaining. But so can Fox News. Neither of which are truthful."
1,What a waste of time,"This is a good read if you want to know exactly who the Zodiac is NOT, Graysmith's suspect has been debunked. Not just by people who ""didn't like his book"", but by fingerprints and DNA evidence. Graysmith will still try to sell you on Starr (aka Allen) as a viable suspect but can not do so with facts. I'm hoping the upcoming movie wont be quite as fictional but it most likely will be."
5,Zodiac,"Book arrived on time, in excellent shape. Good reading, scared the beejesus out of me when i first read it in 1980. this zodiac killer was never cuaght and did his rean of death up until 2008....."
5,Couldn't read it fast enough.,"This book opened my eyes. Before reading this, I was just a small town kid who had no idea things like this happened. Not to mention in the late 60's. Graysmith is a master at weaving the tale of a mysterious being who calls himself the Zodiac. The vivid descriptions and attention to detail he derives through his interviews with those involved in the case still haunt me at least once a week in my sleep. Graysmith is the king of true crime in my book and a master at non-fiction in general. He puts you there, and I suggest all of his books and I'm eagerly awaiting The Bell Tower."
3,Needed a better writer and a better printer!,"The story of the Zodiac killer is a fascinating one. The story of how Robert Graysmith, a political cartoonist on the staff of the SF Chrionicle at the time of the Zodiac murders, became obsessed with discovering the killer's true identity is also fascinating. Mr. Graysmith seems to have been a diligent and thorough researcher and may also be a talented cartoonist. Unfortunately, he's no writer. The text switches back and forth between clumsy, overwrought purple-ness and dry, just-the-facts recitation. Worse, it's full of grammatical howlers that I was surprised to see make it into a final published text. I was also unhappy with the quality of the edition itself, which is the paperback movie tie-in one. The printing is blurry and too fine for comfortabe reading and slopes this way and that across different pages.Still, I read it cover to cover and wasn't sorry when I was finished."
3,Serial Killer,This was a good treatment of a serial killer and the investigation into it by various police departments. Written by a newspaper reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle who did his own investigation in cooperation with the police.I'd recommend the book for those interested in chasing down the clues.
4,Great insight,I liked the movie a lot but wanted to know more - now I fear I know too much. It is an interesting painfully detailed account of the Zodiac murders.
5,5 Stars For Sure,"Awesome, awesome, awesome. I have heard that some of the ""facts"" are not accurate, but this book is still great. It doesn't just scratch upon the surface, but rather cuts then burrows down deep into the guts of the case and comes tearing out through a large gaping exit wound. It presents all the facts without ever getting boring or bogged down. The author also presents many theories that are well thought out, and never seem half-baked. Ultimately though it is a bit anti-climactic, but this is the case of the Zodiac Killer..."
3,Department of Morbid Details,"Apparently used as a gruesome ""how to"" manual by Heriberto ""Eddie"" Seda, the 1989-1996 New York ""Zodiac copycat."" Readers should be aware that most students of the truly mysterious Zodiac case believe that Graysmith's candidate for the perpetrator is not the right guy. But relentless self-promotion has worked -- this has become one of the longest-running true crime books."
3,Enlightening of the facts,"Graysmith recounts the timeline of the unsolved serial murders of the ""Zodiac"" killer. I knew that Zodiac is still free, but it never really hit me that he's among us until after I read this book. This person (or possibly more than one person) is working with somebody, sleeping with somebody, cared for by somebody. Could be you. Could be me. Nobody is working on the case anymore. He's intelligent. He's possibly still killing. He's good at what he does (however horrible and gruesome it is). He's free."
4,"A Book Nearly As ""Perfect"" As The Crimes","Mr. Graysmith is to be commended for a thoroughly researched and beautifully written account of a truly horrific series of crimes. The reader should be warned in advance that one reading leads to another; the book is that fascinating. If there is a fault in Graysmith's effort, it lies in his conviction that one particular suspect was responsible for the crimes and the diabolical letters written to the newspapers and police. It should be noted that the Zodiac case remains unsolved. A thoroughly absorbing book. Four stars!"
2,A Bit Egocentric?,"At first read, the book seems great. I mean, it's absolutely teeming with information... But not all of the information is true. Graysmith writes that after the murder of Stine, police actually stopped the killer asking him if they had seen anyone matching the (false) description they had of the suspect. However, there's no record of this except for in Graysmith's book. He puts himself into it too much, adding unnecessary lines and chapters about his own personal search for the killer, such as the line (when he's being led out to the Lake Berryessa crime scene), ""'Watch out for snakes,' he told me."" Lines such as these seem to serve only as a way for Graysmith to brag about is involvement. Interesting stuff; horrible writing."
5,Zodiac,I bought this book because I didn't know a thing about the case and was very interested to get information about it. Courious to find out about the case. If you don't know anything about the case & want to find out the story then get this book. It's worth reading.
3,It was OK for the price,"Wagner is supposed to be a good brand for Auto Bulbs, I have used them before but this perticular pair did not last, One of the bulb blew up within 2 weeks . One Right headlight was blown on my car, and as recomended, I replaced both headlights at the same time, Within two weeks one on Left side blew up. Now I have re-installed the one, I had removed from left side. And both headlights are working fine so far."
4,Great for newcomers only!,"The book is simple yet concise in presenting disk drive mechanisms for the layman and does away with excessively complex formulations found in most texts. That's the main reason why I rate it as excellent for newbies to the data storage industry. As for experts, it serves as good instructional material as well as a handy reference. The contents are well-delivered, breaking into different sections for discussion and each chapter ending with references for in-depth reading. While the book attempts to cover the evolution of drive design (e.g. ferrite technology), there is also up-to-date coverage on newer stuff like giant magnetoresistive heads and PRML technology. On the other hand, the disappointing areas are the lack of discussion in mechanical aspects, assembly and perhaps, on the servo and spindle control.In general, this is a helpful book for people interested in basic understanding of a magnetic disk drive. Wish I have this sooner..."
5,What Special Operations is all about.,"If your interested in joining any Special Operations Force, the get this video. See what it really takes to be the best of the best."
1,Army Green Berets?,"I went to bootcamp in March of 2001 in the United States Marine Corps. All I have to say is that everything I saw these ""Special Forces"" candidates doing is what we did in bootcamp. It wasn't any two weeks either. Don't waste your money."
3,"My Guide 3050 - Lots of features, one killer flaw...","I am a GPS junkie. I own or have owned about 15 units over the last 10 years. The features of the MyGuide 3050 are excellent, based on the SiRF chipset capability. As others have pointed out, the lack of a real time clock is a killer. On power-up the unit defaults to 2 AM somewhere in Europe. This sets the screen to night time if the night screen is programmed in. After start up you have to set the date (start-up is a few years ago) and correct time into the unit for other features to work (arrival time etc). Having said that the unit performs very well in actual use. Support is weak, I have sent two emails with questions to the company, both unanswered."
5,Great to dance to,"My daughter loves to dance around to this cd. She is only 18 months, but she loves when we play this CD. She even spins to song #3."
1,"Kindle kin, be aware, this light will NOT ""work with the Kindle.""","Somehow this item got tagged 'Kindle' and now there are discussions here and there on its usefulness. Hopefully the 'Kindle' tag will be removed at some point. Until then, those wanting to use this little light with the Kindle, be aware that the USB end of it must go into a USB port. Therefore, it can not be plugged in to the Kindle directly. How else you plan to use it is up to you, of course. That is all. :-)"
2,"Decent Light, not the best.","I bought this USB light for my Gateway NV53A notebook. It's easy enough to use, but hardly bright enough to illuminate the entire keyboard, even in areas with no light at all.The flexible neck is sturdy and well made. The light is actually way too dim, it would have been nice to adjust the brightness."
5,Packed with Knowledge!,"Many business books provide just enough information to whet executives' appetites for more advice accompanied by high consulting fees. Author Kees van der Heijden has written an exception. His comprehensive volume puts scenario building in historical context, explains its relationship to forecasting and tells you how to introduce scenario planning to your organization. Once you understand your corporate identity and your fundamental ""Business Idea,"" he says, you can establish and enact informative scenarios that will prepare your company for several different versions of what lies ahead. In that way, scenario planning generates better decision making. We strongly recommend this book to top managers, strategists and planners, especially those who sense they're making decisions on the fly without having a structure for thinking deeply about future implications."
3,Great content but writing style makes for hard reading,"Frankly I'm surprised at all the glowing reports without someone mentioning that this isn't the easiest book to read. Not that the language is difficult. Rather the sentences are long and often unclear, and there are too many reference to past and future chapters.I'd suggest reading a few paragraphs before purchasing the book. You might find that this book is not for you -- it didn't do anything for me. I gave up half way through the book, maybe there was more value in the second half."
5,Process to get a business to think strategic vs tactics,"This book is aimed at corporate strategists, or anyone responsible for figuring out where a business needs to go, vs. what the business is doing today. You can also use these techniques for your personal life. Kees uses lots of examples to get his ideas across. I personally found the text too dry and academic, but the ideas and processes presented are excellent, and it is well worth the read. I also appreciated his comments on dealing with internal politics, which seems to be the over-arching subject in a lot of these meetings. A very good companion book would be Peter Schwartz's The Art of the Long View. Both Peter and Kees used to work together at Shell, and both books complement each other"
3,Cut to death,"Seven swords is a really good movie, but feels like its a smaller portion of something bigger. Then when you go through the special features you find out there was a cut that was almost four hours. This helped me understand why there were so many gaps in the story, and backstory. But the cut provided was very entertaining, with some great fights, and some very unique bad guys, which is often a rarity in kung fu movies. The only real complaint I had, beyond the aforementioned wholes in the story, would be the dubbing. Most was very off, but donnie yens voice sounded more like he was michael clark duncan than donnie yen. Given I've seen donnie yen do his own dubbing several times I was suprised that not only he didn't do it, but that he had such a different sounding voice. Otherwise the movie is entertaining, but more of a portion of a whole concept. Worth watching"
1,Sorry,"I was not impressed with this movie at all, it had too many slow boring moments and I didn't like the ending."
3,7 Swords,"A little above average movie. Story-line is ok, acting is average, and action is ok. It seemed typical ""Asian martial arts"" genre. Try not to pay full price."
3,Action but....,A bit disjointed and definately not Tsui Hark's best but still entertaining. Good Wu Xia but at some point the story drags a little yet the charactor's are pretty interesting.
1,Big disappointment...,"Okay, first things first: ""The Magificent 7"" or ""Seven Samurai,"" this movie is most definitely NOT.It is more like ""The Storm Riders"" meets ""Conan"" meets ""Mad Max.""The action is grotesque, without any really great choreography. The plot is thin. Character development is poor. Overall, very poorly done...Don't waste your time or money."
3,"Great movie, bad writing","Why is it that there are so many movies with bad writers? Can't someone find people to watch the movie and re-write it before they release to the public. I am only saying this because I enjoyed this movie so much and would give it a 5 for plot action, fighting, love but they totally mess the movie up with bad writing and there are just a lot of thigns that happen that you wish would have went the other way!~shauns movie review"
3,Suspensefful + Splendid scenery + Spectacular fighting + Non-stop action + No time for love and character development.,"This movie shows it has a big budget. It contains splendid scenery. The giant mountains with snow look beautiful and scary. The fighting scenes are fast, bloody and furious with strange weapons. Sometimes it's hard to see what's going on. The action is non-stop. It has quite a few suspenseful scenes.My only complaint is it gives no time to love and character develpment. They exist in the movie but for a very short time. As a result, they can't make me feel anything.It's worth renting but not buying."
5,Pleasant,"it's not exactly great, it definatly didn't look too fake as, crouching tiger hidden dragon. i first watched this movie while i was in afghanistan, so i recommended it to my cousin. we now both enjoy this movie, because of the fact that they tried to keep away from making people fly."
1,Disappointing,"Choppy cinematography, poor characterization, and an incoherent plot. I'm not sure what the director was trying to accomplish, but the film as presented is practically incomprehensible. The fight choreography is nothing special, and the dialogue seems to lurch from one non sequitur to another. One gets the impression that better editing could have produced a very different (and possibly superior) film, but what is there just doesn't hold together."
3,Not impressed,"""Seven Swords"" is a bit bland, to be honest. Great director, nice sound and look, Donnie Yen, the magnificent Lau Kar Leung. It has the right ingredients, but simply fails to make an impression. Not enough character development, silly fighting and less than amazing dialogue. There is perhaps too much fiddling around with the look of the 'baddies', who look sort of ridiculous.I wouldn't see it again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not absolute genre- or Yen-fans. 2,5 stars."
5,Don't let the photo mislead you,"Ignore the misleading, completely inaccurate photo. This IS the correct 20"" bed extension for the Jet 1642 EVS lathe. Mine arrived in just a couple days, with FREE shipping. Fits my Jet 1642 perfectly. I can now turn spindles up to ~ 60"" long."
3,Good Choice,Nice Music.I performed this music last year.It was great music. worth it to pay that money. But remeber that the paper quality was not good.
5,The sound of Synchrovision's definitly kickin'it,"a friend gave me this records to have a ear on it, and bammm !can't quit it,i'm a musicien as well,and i tell you,if you enjoy avant garde jazz'n'tronic this one is for you really.can't wait for the next one"
3,Not quite what I had expected,This cd had some pretty cool jazz type stuff in it but I was expecting something more along the lines of trumpets or piano. To me this was mainly just an abstract record that needed to be arranged a little better. There are some pretty good tracks on this but I would definately give it a listen before you consider buying it.
3,A little deceptive,The books original title indicated that the book was written about the Northern forests. The majority of the trees and animals mentioned were indigenous to Northern forests and don't even exist in SC where I live. I enjoyed the book and learned a lot but a lot doesn't apply to my area.
5,jmilligan@swf.sk.ca,"This book is outstanding. Though written as a book of wilderness living skill in the northern boreal forest, the skills can be applied to a survival situation. The book is well illustrated with clear blackline drawings and is easy to read. Check out some of Mors other articles in The Society of Primitive Technology's 'Primitive Technology: A Book of Earth Skills.' Mr. Kochanski is one of the world leaders in wilderness living skills his dedication, research and expertise in wilderness living is recognized around the world. After reading Bushcraft and his work in other journals you'll know why."
3,"Pretty solid read, great for a cabin","Authenticity bleeds thru this product. Lots of helpful passages about all kinds of field skills. Really a pretty good read, but honestly, nothing you couldn't find by searching the internet."
2,not practical.,"This book is frankly a waste of your money. if you are going to spend it, spend it on a more practiacal book. Bushcraft spends 35 pages telling you how to hold a knife, it almost insults a person with any common sense.One other thing, it does not have any pictures, all line drawings. (most impractical, and innapplicable in the real thing)It does not have anything on traps, snares, or other devices, which will make-or-break a person in wilderness survival.This is a good book if there were none others available, however, there are many which are a much greater value of your money, like Primitive Wilderness Survival Skills, by John McPherson. Check authors like: Jim Riggs, Larry Dean Olsen, Tom Brown, Richard Jamison, to name a few."
5,Amazing book,Bushcraft: An amazing book for those of us who live close to canada or those of us who do live in canada. (I say that because the enviroment that this book covers is based on these areas.) This book (besides an edible plant book) would be the only book you would ever need to live in the northwoods of America. The drawings are simple yet very easy to read and see what you need to learn. Axecraft is taught in this book which is very important. I myself had no idea how to properly use my axe until I read this book and watched a couple videos on youtube. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn new wilderness skills.
1,Written for professor.,"Overpriced, all black and white drawings. One of the few books I bought online that I wish I had seen in person first. I would not recommend buying the book unless you need it for a college course."
3,Dazzle Creation Station 200 USB,"Installation of this device was easy and it works well. However, picture captured by computer is much lighter than that on my camcorder. Am I using it wrongly or this is all that the device can do?Dazzle talks about free service which is a joke. When you call machine tells you to call another number where you can get service for a fee. For free service, they let you hang on forever. I called and held phone for ten minutes without an answer.Try it at you own risk."
1,frustrating dvd creation station,"I am so frustrated using this product. First of all, I had to go online to update the software then the movie software would freeze up on me. The quality of transfering the video tapes to dvd was terrible. It was just a big waste of money. I even tried to ask for help...got nowhere...the support was just not there. After working on it for over ten hours, I learned my lesson and that is to read reviews and opinions of products from customers before purchasing new items."
2,Not Quite,"The topic is interesting, but it gets crushed by all the meandering. I found it quite disjointed."
4,Low production values but good exercises,"When I first played this DVD, I found the fixed smile on ""Sunshine"" and the overly loud background music annoying. I also thought the five or ten minute filler at the end to be a bit much.Those are the only minuses, though, in this otherwise wonderful exercise video for seniors. I'd tried others and they tended to move too quickly for my arthritic 86 year old mother: by the time she'd have mastered one movement, the presenter would have moved on to another and getting ready for a third. This DVD is well-paced and more importantly, does a good job of gently exercising a lot of muscle groups, expecially legs and upper body. I have recommended this title to others and will continue to do so."
5,Great for seniors!,"I bought this for my grandmother, who is in stage 2 of Alzheimer's Disease. She is able to follow along with all of the segments and really enjoys the hostess."
5,"Seniors Exercise Dvd, Easy Simple & Effective.","Purchased for an elderly gentleman, he enjoys following along and doing the exercises. His balance is off, so being able to hold a chair in the lower body exercises and exercise is just right.It's a great DVD for seniors. Very easy to do and she does them slow enough for everyone to keep up with. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Not worth the money,"The exercises were ""just ok"" but the main problem with the video was the fact that ""Sunshine"" looked just like a mannequin or possibly someone with a face super imposed over the actual face. I found myself so caught up in watching for some type of facial expression while doing just routine exercise While working with Seniors and sometimes nursing home patients the video gave nothing other than routine. The background scenery was great however. I would not recommend this particular video."
3,Elder Easy Pilates Exercises DVD,Helpful information presented by an exercise model who has an unchanging plastic (frozen) smile on her face.
2,Easy Cheesy,"I am quoting Thumper from Bambi on this video...'If you don't have anything nice to say, then say nothing at all.'The End"
5,Easy Exercises for Seniors and Elderly.,I got this DVD and the easy sitting exercises dvd for Grandma. She enjoys doing the exercises which are very easy and simple. This DVD is full of a variety of exercises for the whole body and is excellent for seniors. Very clearly explained and is done on a beautiful sunny beach. Recomended.
4,Great,This was also a great DVD for the elderly. The people I work with can't stand but i use it at home and love it.
3,There's better out there.,"I decided to read the Left Behind series concurrently with the Harry Potter series. ""In all that is fair, balance that which is opposite and settle on a theory."" Interestingly, I felt more joy and warmth after each of the Harry books. The authors of Left Behind seemed to direct the reader along a ""fear"" course. I read for enjoyment, mostly, and while both series are clearly targeting the 8 to 16 year-old audience, it quickly became apparent to me that a journey with a budding wizard is infinitely more satisfying to an adult than a flawed downward spiral of a ""trip"" with the chosen few."
3,Troubling but Lessons can Be Learned from Left Behind,"I've read the series through the ninth book and continue reading even though I have strong reservations about the theology and political implications. What motivates my reading is a desire to learn how a conservative Christian may see the world. I've learned there is a language and different way of thinking. The biggest surprise was that much of the series is based on fear -- fear of God, fear of our neighbor, fear of the future, etc... One positive thing is that it shows that whole-hearted devotion takes commitment and work. While the writing style is simple, I don't think I would be willing to commitment to a ""deeper"" writing style to learn this. The journey of reading Left Behind is troubling, quick, yet challenging because I have to learn to suspend my own thinking as a Christian to understand a point of view shared by many, many people."
3,Interesting - addictive - but accurate?,"My son got the first seven books for free so I read them all in three days then bought the next two used. On the positive side - they are are reminder to be spiritually awake and that the Bible says God has the last word but that evil will reach its peak before that. On the negative - it appears from Scripture that although many who never knew the Gospel will have the opportunity to repent after the Rapture, people who did know and neglect or reject the offer will not. I believe this series gives false hope to those people. Also, it seems unlikely that the Antichrist will be praying to Lucifer, but rather exalting himself perhaps unaware of Satan's control of himself. It also seems unlikely that he will actually use Jesus's words but rather his own words and secular philosophy. Interesting reading, but don't swallow it whole. Compare it with the Bible."
2,Fun Books-Lousy Theology,"This series of books should be read for fun and entertainment, not as a discourse in the theology of eschatology. I enjoyed reading the books myself, but would hesitate to recommend them to a new Christian or nonbeliever who might become confused."
4,ASTONISHING,"It takes a lot to get me into a book. I read the first two pages of the first book and I was hooked. I'm not a real religious person, but this has got to be the most amazing book/series I've ever read. Once you start, you don't want to put the book down because you want to know what's going to happen next. Many times I couldn't remember what would happen between one reading and another in other books I read, but this one you cannot forget. These two gentlemen did a wonderful job and I hope they continue on with this series as well as come up with another one."
2,Leaving behind a plethora of religions,"I had anticipated an apocalypse-type book of the likes of Stephen King's THE STAND. I wasn't anticipating a bigoted book of ""only Christians need apply."" As most people know (and why half the world is envious), the Jews are ""God's chosen people."" How embarrassing for him that he didn't give them train tickets. The premise hooked me in the beginning but the dumbed-down writing attempts to only hook middle school-aged kids. The ""down on your knees and worship"" message made this Catholic feel like she was being harassed by the Hari Krishnas at the airport or the Jehovah Witness glued to my doorstep. My mistake was that I was expecting an exciting futuristic fiction tale but got an unneeded lecture series instead."
2,A bit of an embarrassment overall,"On one hand I am really glad that this book is selling so well. Many mainstream readers are probably contemplating eternal matters they never would have otherwise contemplated.However, I was a bit embarrassed not only by the strong emphasis on events which are biblically questionable, but also the sloppy writing style and the missed details. The story is definitely exciting -- in the same way that a Tom Clancy story is riveting, but Tom Clancy gets his details straight and Lahaye and Jenkins disappoint. Aircraft types and technical details were rife with errors -- and while this doesn't hurt the story, it does hurt the credibility of more important (eternal) details.After all I'd heard about these books, I had hoped for better."
5,If you enjoyed Left Behind . . .,"If you enjoy Left Behind, I would strongly second what so many other reveiwers have already said and suggest TheChrist Clone novels and We All Fall Down by Brian Caldwell. Both are similar to Left Behind but vastly different in aproach. I read them while waiting for the eleventh Left Behind and, while I love that series, found them to be just as good, and possibly better."
1,How Horribly Mean!,"I started the first one, but there was something in there that irked me so much, I just couldn't finish.Here it is. There is a girl (I don't remember her name) whose Dad was a complete playboy. He always had women over, he didn't care about his daughter, etc. However, he hears a preacher one night and ""gets saved."" Hence, when the rapture comes, he is taken up, and the daughter is left behind. Immediate Problems. Jesus, Who is all Just, would never make a daughter pay for her father's mistakes so dearly. Mr. LaHaye actually expects me to believe that this poor girl, who has never been taught or shown about Christ, is left behind.! And, to add insult to injury, her father, who was responsible for his daughter's soul and left it in jeopardy, gets raptured anyways?! Hello?It is a good thing Jesus is running the world and not the authors of Left Behind."
2,Scapegoating?,Is the Left Behind series an exercise in scapegoating non-believers in Tim LeHaye's definition of Christianity?I found Rene Girard's interpretation of the bible a lot more compelling an argument for what Judaism and Christianity have contributed to attitudes of open-mindedness and tolerance we take for granted in everyday life. (the audio cassette kit ISBN 0660184966 is an easy-to-listen-to overview of Rene Girard's ideas)
5,Amazing series,"I'm not a big reader, but my parents gave me volume 1 to read and I put off starting it for something like 6-12 months. By the time I finished it, I had to get the next one ASAP. I couldn't stop reading these. I had to force myself to go to bed whenever I noticed the clock hitting the early AM hours.The first book took me a few months to read (as mentioned, not much into reading), but after that, every book in the series volumes 2-12 I completed each in 1-2 weeks easily. LOVED them"
1,The worst variety of non-biblical tripe-- Get yours today!,"Listen folks, what you're reading here is unintellectual garbage of the highest degree. I am completely amazed that something so biblically unfounded can be passed off as Christian. I read reviews all the time stating that the Left Behind books have brought people back to Christianity and they couldn't be happier. Good for you. My only question is this: Where is all this rapture baloney in the bible? LaHaye and Jenkins will have us believe they found it in the book of Revelation. It's not there. I've looked. In fact, any review I've read of these books by scholarly Catholics, Protesants, or Evangelicals, states that these books are intellectual shabby, and theologically unsound. The Rapture? The End Times? You want a good book about the end times? Try the bible. This dispensationalist blather will only make you paranoid. And trust me, LaHaye and Jenkins don't need the money. Use the internet. Research the truth."
2,Something better to read,"I highly recommend reading ""End Times Fiction A Biblical Consideration Of The Left Behind Theology"" by Gary DeMar, instead of anything having to do with this series or with any notion of a theological thinking that was never part of the early church. In this book, DeMar demonstrates the flawed interpretation of pretribulational/premillennialism and instead lets the biblical text speak for itself."
5,Fantastic!,"I absolutely love this series. I wait on the edge of my seat for each new edition. Great past paced stories, interesting characters, and great Christian theme."
1,The Truth? Who knows besides God?,"Although this book was very entertaining, it cannot be proved factual. The rapture is a highly debated topic among Christians. The truth is,until Christ has returned, we cannot tell what is going to happen. It is my belief that people won't come to Christ and stay in Him if their only motivation is not wanting to be ""left behind"". What kind of love is that? That is not what the Bible describes as a personal relationship with Christ. If you want to try to save someone, don't scare them, inspire them."
5,Don't be left behind - just get the books and begin.,"I have read many Christian novels involving the Tribulation and this series of books has come as close to nailing how these last events will take place. Once I started with the first book, it stayed open until I finished it 2 days later. I am now on Book 8 - The Mark - and I await my order eagerly. If you are a serious Book of Revelation follower do not even read another review. Just get the books and begin!"
2,living proof!,"This novel, speaking of the first one of the series, is living proof that interesting ideas do not necessarily make a great novel. I was attracted by the book's premise but the shallow writing and expression left me wanting so much more. In fact, I ""left the book behind"" and did not even finish the novel."
1,Revelation meets cartoon 007,"Secret agent, newly confessed Christians fight the powers of Lucifer! The authors should have included action illustrations so people will know what they are really reading: a comic book. I understand the authors are trying to keep foul language and violence to a minimum, but their lack of skill with this makes their characters trite and their scenes shallow. In addition, each successive book says so much less than the previous one, that I'm starting to worry that these good Christian men are profiteering. Come on, 8 books to tell this story!? I gave up at book 4. I found myself basically skimming the whole book. But these guys are laughing all the way to the bank."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,Had to buy and return several time from different sites but this one did perfectly fit our blender and it worked till blender broke few months back.
1,not the right size for the blender stated!,"this o-ring is thicker than the one replacing it. don't know at what point it changed, but what a disappointment. the blender doesn't fit in the housing correctly and runs the motor super hot."
2,Does not fit all domestic models,"It does not fit all Hamilton beach models. It was not expensive, but it will not work in the wave master blenders. That is such a shame. Unfortunately Hamilton Beach wants 7.99 for their gasket and 8.99 to ship the darn thing. I could buy a new blender for a few dollars more."
1,Does Not Fit Hamilton Beach Model 91200 commercial Blender,"This Does not fit the Hamilton Beach / Proctor Silex Commercial Blender, Model 91200. The gasket is a bit too wide.The seal ring might fit other blenders OK, but not mine. Product appears to be sufficient quality, if it were the correct size."
3,Not the right size,Products such as this one really need to have dimensions in the product descriptions. I took a chance on this one but it turned out that it did not fit my blender. The gasket itself is fine but it is just not the size I need.
4,amazing how much fulfillment is in one little O-ring,"When my original O-ring was melted on the heating element of my dishwasher, I thought I would have to toss out the old blender and buy a new one. I was wrong. The replacement O-ring for my Hamilton Beach mixer works like a charm. My only complaint is that it took a long time to arrive (more than a week overdue)."
5,Good quality,The gasket fit my Hamilton Beach blender perfect. I liked that it is actually thicker than the one I had and therefore creates a better seal.
3,"Not one size fits all, but does the job if you stretch it.","Like most of the reviewers I discovered that this is not a one size fits all. However, if you stretch it, then it fits and works."
1,Does NOT fit ALL Hamilton Beach Blenders as advertised,"Too small for my Wave-Action 10-speed. Frustrating to wait for it to arrive, only to find it doesn't fit."
2,Did not fit but we made it work,"Seal was not the correct one for my model, it was too large for the blender but we modified the seal and made it work. I did not contact seller for a replacement since it was such a small purchase and just would have been more trouble than it was worth, we just made it work. It is still working."
1,save your pennies,"Item seemed hand made and was torn when i received it. Above all it didnt fit my blender, so it was a waste of time and money"
1,Didn't fit,"We were told this ring was the size for our blender, but it wasn't. The shipper was great to get it returned, we just didn't return it because it wasn't expensive at all."
2,Not universal!,Good quality; it would be a fine replacement if only it fit my blender. This o-ring seal was advertised as fitting all Hamilton Beach blenders made in the U.S. I have a B40 blender (51645) and it is the wrong one.
2,Catholic Catecism class?,"I love Paul Johnson. I love Paul Johnson's books. I just disliked this one. His impeccable credentials (Oxford) and his usual penchant for exhaustive scholarly research (The Intellectuals, History of the Jews, History of Christianity, etc.) were surprisingly absent. This book is thoroughly Catholic - not necessarily a bad thing mind you. It's just that the book title had nothing to do with the book. This was no ""Quest"", no grappling with doubt or faith or pain. Just a Catholic Catecism - a celebration of one man's faith, not the Quest or personal pilgrimage of a man searching for God. It appears that Johnson has found God, neatly and conveniently inside the cathedral. That's O.K. for him. I just was hoping he would help me turn over a few more stones."
4,a thoughtful meditation based on a serious life,"I was quite surprised by some of the reviews. Some discount him as a dogmatic Catholic; others don't seem to like his politics; still others deride it for weak apologetics. I am not a Catholic, I don't care about the politics of someone reporting his or her spiritual journey, and I did not see the book as an exercise in apologetics. It is, as I read it, a personal report of one man's spiritual quest. I found it honest, serious, thoughtful, and insightful. I think that is the test of a spiritual memoir."
1,Profound Disappointment,"I am always interested in spiritual autobiographies. Works that explain how an individual grappled with the problems of existence and came to an appreciation of their faith. Unfortunately, there is no sense here that Mr. Johnson ever challenged anything relating to his faith. The book also includes several severely homophobic comments. Mr. Johnson's previous works were solid, if conservative. I expected more from him."
1,"The food was dodgy, I won't be eating here again","Sorry, once was enough. I've read this guy's work in the Daily Mail (fool that I am). This is more of the same. Amazing how so obviously intelligent a man can be so blinded by faith and dogma that he turns into a sub-fascist apologist for virtually any entity that would take away human rights. Why can't Richard Dawkins turn his brilliant mind loose on this dinosaur ? He'd make chutney of him."
1,He's no Theologian,"Johnson is a historian, the darling of conservatives like Wm. Buckley. He is, however, no theologian. That is apparent at once. And his bigoted rantings against gays severely diminish a book which is supposed to be, after all, about finding God. You would think that a man who is concerned with weighty and important matters would be above such pettiness.You'd be much better off picking up a copy of Abraham Heschel's ""Man's Quest for God"". From him, you might learn something!"
2,Once again Politcial agendas take a front seat to the actual SVU aspect,Seems this season is full of political so to speak soapboxes. This whole case is stupid in that They should have thrown the girl in jail. First she lies and claims rape then she runs over half a dozen people. Shes an idiot too attractive young girl could get anyone she wanted if she wasnt an idiot. Kinda stupid case and the rock star was a moron
2,Defective,"The item came, a 6 CD box set and only 3 of the DVDs would work. The seller could not exchange the item which is what I want, but said he would refund the money, which has not yet been done. I had a negative experience with this seller"
2,No justice,"Let me see if I've got this right. They're releasing the seventh year of SVU before the sixth year of the much superior original series even though the original has been on the air for twice as many seasons as the spinoff.There may be Law & Order, but there sure ain't no justice!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Pretty good episode wish theyd can the politcal agenda crap,"SVU is supposed to be about investigating sexually based crimes but instead it seems the past two episodes or so have been at the end about a political agenda. Guns rights, etc. I think they should stick to the subject matter and stop trying to inject political statements that have really little to do with the SVU as it appears a bit preachy and off topic. Other then that good episode."
5,Sweet!,"These goggles are awesome! Flexible so they fit over my helmet, super cute and comfy! Definitely recommend them! They're awesome!"
1,My SCOTT Goggles fell apart,"My Scott Ski Goggles were fine, for a while. But then the rubber rotted and they just fell apart! That's not what I expected from a supposedly high quality product. I contacted Scott, but they claimed it had been over exposure to the sun which caused the rubber to rot. It didn't impress them that none of the other goggles which I had kept as long or longer under exactly the same, well protected conditions didn't disintegrate like the Scotts did. The only time the Scott goggles were exposed to sunlight was when I skied, and that was not more than a few weeks a year. They just didn't care.I won't buy Scott products again."
4,Beginners Fitness,"I like this DVD. I started out using three-pound weights and I notice when I go up to five-pound weights, I get really sore, so it must be good exercise! My only nitpick is that the DVD is a bit amateurish. For instance, some of the words that appear on the screen are misspelled. Nice introduction to weight training, though, in a pretty beach setting."
2,Not for over 50,"I bought this product because it came up when I typed in ""exercises for the elderly"". I saw a brief snippet on the dvd and it looked great. Nothing that a person my age or physical limitations couldn't do. I decided to order it.Warms up were mostly good, upper body great, then she started the lower body which you couldn't do unless you DON""T have lower back or knee problems. This is a dvd for beginners who haven't any physical limitations. I gave it two stars because I can use the upper body strengthening. Good luck."
2,Poor production quality,"While the exercises on this video were simple enough for my obese friend. The production was so ridiculous it seemed like a joke. I personally use high quality exercise videos such as Jillian Michael's and Jackie Warner. I've even used the Biggest Loser workouts which I think are really great, but still just a little too advanced for my friend. This video had some good reviews and I was really hoping it would be a truly good beginners forum. If anyone has any suggestions for a basic beginners instructional video, but with the production quality of the big name videos, I would be very grateful."
2,Fun Circuits Double,"I'm really disappointed that this DVD is simply the Fun Circuit DVD, dressed in different packaging. I already have the Fun Circuit one and had I known Beginner's Fitness was going to be an exact duplicate I would have tried to order another DVD from these series of workout DVD's.Aside from that the DVD came in perfect condition and this has nothing to do with the seller who sent everything in a timely manner, wonderful packaging and the cost was reasonable."
1,Terrible video,This is one of the worst exercise video I have ordered. It jumped around from floor to standing exercises making it hard to keep up. Very bland narration of exercises. No motivation. Save your money and order Tammi Lee Webb.
3,Only for beginners,"This workout is good for beginners, but almost too easy for someone who has any recent history of working out. It is also too short, not even being 30 minutes. I use it as a supplemental plan along with other activites, mostly aerobic."
3,Fun Beginners,The DVD was just okay. Not quite what I was looking for and the exercises went very slow. The scenery was nice to look at though.
1,Open office is free and outdated.,"You can get OO 3.4.0 for Mac PC or linux here [...] for free or you can get the fork of O Libreoffes here [...],"
3,"Very technically written, but informative.","The book is very informative, but can be quite technical for the non-medical person. Also, with the FDA approval of vagus nerve stimulation for chronic depression, I would recommend a great book about this medical breakthrough procedure: ""Out of the Black Hole: The Patient's Guide to Vagus Nerve Stimulation and Depression"". It is written by a patient for patients. Apparently this new therapy has none of the side effects of ECT.Depression is still dismal, so anything that offers hope other than ECT sounds good to me."
4,Ethnography and Mythology,"William Geddes is one of the few ethnographers to have worked with the Land Dayaks of Sarawak. This book is based on his research in the village of Mentu Tapuh. It is divided into two sections. The first is a basic ethnography with an emphasis on social structure. The second is the recounting of the myth of culture-hero Kipachi (for which it took his informant nine nights to tell, hence the title). This is a good book about an interesting group of people."
2,Palmieri's best?,"I wouldn't say that, how can anybody forgetting albums like: Champagne, Mozambique or songs like: Muñeca, Vamonos pal monte, busca lo tuyo?,...so, the best of Palmieri? nothing farest away from the truth. Perhaps the highlight of this record is ""Ritmo Alegre"" song by Cheo Feliciano, with a very interesting arrangment, the horns in that song sound like they have to and the performance of Cheo is unmatchable. I'd recommend you to get the track I mentioned by coping it from somebdy and buy the real Palmieri's best, that old record he made with Ismael Quintana."
4,entertaining,"I enjoyed this novel. Very realistic feel to the language and format. A fast read, which is not deep, but entertaining."
5,Leather Treatments,"Products perform well. I don't have to worry about stains, odors, or skin reaction when I use them."
1,Great Cleaner For CHEAP Leather,"This cleaner is terrible it destroyed my couch. I had a camel leather with matte finish so it was not a high sheen or high plastic like vinyl that you find in many cars. It was a soft porous leather. The lexol Leather cleaner destroyed the couch, you can literally see where the product was sprayed onto the leather as it was directed. DO NOT USE THIS FOR NICE LEATHER FURNITURE. Trust me I nearly never review items unless they are absolutely great or..a well you can guess the other. Again it works great for my volvo seats but ruined my couch. I hope you do not make the same mistake"
3,"Great story, sloppy editing!","I've enjoyed several Luanne Rice books before. I love her beach settings, and deeply moving plots and characters. I have to complain about the sloppy editing in this one though. I'm reading along a very moving scene between Rummer and Michael reconnecting and the next paragraph it's Rummer and 'Colton' talking? I'm assuming someone zoned out while transcribing and got the names mixed up, but it sure yanked me out of the story in a hurry. Hate when that happens. I have the mass market paperback. Hopefully that's been corrected in later editions."
3,A Little too Blue For My Taste But..,"It is a good story. It's a very simply written story. Wonderful plot, I find it a little hard to believe that two people who were so in love let themselves suffer and be seperated for so long. And a little hard to believe that Zeb would fall for the love of his life's sister without so much as a question or at least a heart to heart before the wedding. I think so much more could have been done with this story.It is a sweet tug at your heart strings book though. Once again, one of my signature comments; a good quick weekend read. Best on a rainy weekend."
5,Original Tale of the enduring power of first loves,"At first glance this tale looks like another true love lost and found story. Not so. Rice has re-created a scene of emotions, nostalgia, regret, and remembrance that is original, touching, and full of warmth. We all wish we could find the other halves of our soul. Some of us do at an early age but through human errors ... destroy it. True Blue is a chance to read about possibilities to repair the heart despite time. Great for a cozy weekend romantic reading retreat. If you love this and other Rice books, you'll also enjoy The Last Time They Met by Anita Shreve."
3,It's a start,"Aside from the spelling and grammatical errors, I found this book extremely helpful in getting me past the clutter of acronyms that are so prevalent in the telecom field. Unfortunately, this is also one of the very few books that is willing to define most of the terms for you. In that regard, I think that this is a great book that serves its purpose. Although I would really like to see a more updated version."
4,Colt Woodsman Pocket Guide,This is a helpful book if you are doing research on this type of gun. I have others like it and use them all the time.
2,Book is NOT up to date with Georgia Divorce Laws,"The Georgia divorce laws had numerous changes effective January 1, 2007. The copyright date of this book - which unfortunetly you cant't seem to find out for any books via the Amazon.com website - is 2001. Which means that the new laws are not covered by this book. I looked up the most recent edition of this book, the fifth edition, and it's copyright date is 2004. To my way of thinking: What good is a book about law, if it is not up to date with the current laws? Not much as far as I'm concerned. Who knows what trouble you might find yourself in following information that is out of date? Amazon.com needs to start providing the copyright date information, especially for books that pertain to the law. Buyer beware!"
5,Good one!,"This was just right for me. Good flick. I'm out of time, else I'd explain why. I really enjoyed it."
3,Tamie,This move was ok some part confusing where they were going with it and was starting to loose interest in it
4,good movie,good movie worth the watch. good thriller and a good ending. i like most of demis movies and this is one i hadnt heard of
3,"Despite some weakness with plot, still enjoyed the movie","While I agree with many of the reviewers who highlighted the few holes in the plot, I still enjoyed the movie and would recommend it for three main reasons:1. the set location was stunning - gorgeous London apt to the idyllic English sea side2. Demi Moore is a likable actress3. The handsome love interest was charming and adorableNo every movie can be as amazing as The 6th sense....in fact, 99% aren't (I am still waiting for M. Night to make another one that is just as good) but that doesn't mean one can't just sit back and enjoy Half Light."
3,Decent way to pass a Sunday evening..,"I didn't watch the DVD version, but watched the TV version so I'm sure I saw quite a tamed version. It was a fairly good movie. It was nice not seeing a lot of Demi's flesh for once..although I'm sure the dvd version showed more in that one scene. She played a likeable character and at times I really felt her loss. She wasn't as emotional as some moms might be though..how's that for talking out of both sides of my mouth?I agree with another viewer's statement about Demi should have had more publicity just as Julianne Moore had. The Forgotten WAS a great movie, but this was good too.I give it 3 stars for Demi and the beautiful scenery."
1,"lackluster plot, poor love interest chemistry..","The good stuff...the location was absolutely breathtaking...the music was fitted well to the scenes..haunting and beautiful...NOW...onto the other stuff..I tried and tried...but I simply couldn't muster any sympathy for the character...why would she react soooo slowly to discovering her child missing..much less seeing his toy in the water and she moves even slower...UGH!...I was like ""jump in the water already!!""...and even the CPR looked so fake..its the details...and I was lost after that...but I still tried to give it a chance...when she met the lighthouse guy...UGH..he was like in his 20's...and there was no chemistry...could it have hurt the movie to have someone her own age or even a little older who possessed a rugged scottish charm??...and I love movies, even some bad ones...but this one I had to turn off."
5,Great romantic ghost mystery,"What a wonderful throwback of a movie- A ghost story with suspense, mystery, romance, and very little blood. Demi Moore, with whom I've never been terribly impressed, turns in a great performance.But the real central character, in the truest sense of the word, is the setting: A small village on the seaside in Scotland. The actors who play the villagers are splendid, in particular the policeman and the woman with 'second sight"".Like any good ghost story or mystery, a certain suspension of disbelief is required, but the sheer gracefulness with which this movie was made allows the plot to slip on like a comfortable slipper. Perfect for rainy night- pay no attention to the naysayers!"
1,Terribly disappointing--don't bother,"Wow.My husband and I were trying to figure out why neither of us had even heard of this movie. When was it in the theatres? Did you see a trailer for it? What the heck is it even about?After watching it this afternoon, I think we have our answer.It was fairly clear within the first five minutes that Demi Moore was contactually obligated to do this film. Her acting, if you can call it that, was akin to Eeyore in a high school play. She wasn't the least bit believable--and I don't think her heart was in it.Naturally, I can't say that I blame her too much. The writing was pathetic and over the top, and the musical score just tried way too hard. (Be sad...this is a very emotional scene...musical swell, musical swell).Blech."
3,good to watch,this movie kept you on your toes waiting to see what was going to happened next. something similar to the six sense.
4,entertaining movie,"I like a good ""ghost"" story. This one was very entertaining; with a little twist or two to boot. I recommend it."
2,nothing special,Easy to figure out. Pretty slow and not inteterersting. Tbe plot needed some work. I would skip this one. A aa a a a a
5,"Spine-tingling, spellbinding, epic movie",The story line draws you into the movie right from the start. You follow along as if you are in the heroine's shoes and mind. Demi Moore is superb in this role. I will not give away the plot here and don't spoil it for yourself by trying to find out what the plot is before watching it. The filmography is excellent; you feel like you are there. You may find yourself asking how in the world is this dramatic mystery going to end? This is a one-of-a-kind artfully suspenseful movie experience.
3,A solid enough plot...,"...to make an entertaining thriller, but poor camera work and obviously uninspiring direction for uninspired acting. Also a couple of unecassary bad effects, when they climb up the stairs to the top of the lighthouse for example -it looks fake indeed.But all in all, I was entertained. A couple of good ""jumps in the seat"", though otherwise not very scary. The story, anything but unique and non-original, wasn't at all that predictable at all I think. And quite clever. It's more in the filmaking of ""Half Light"" the problem lies. And makes it ""just another attempt to repeat The Sixth Sence"". Not much a comeback for Demi Moore, but no disaster neither.Recommended for fans of the genre."
5,Demi... A BREAKTHROUGH Performance,"This is by far the best performance of Mrs. Moore's entire career. A semi-dark, mystery that will keep you guessing. No Hollywood ending here! Mrs. Moore makes you feel the character she portrays. It is definately not what you think! Congrats to Demi for scoring big with this film.It doesn't keep me from wanting to stand on Ashton Kutcher's throat, but this film shows that Mrs. Moore can still make some good decisions. I truly hope she has many more performances like this one in her future. This could be a whole new start to her career!"
2,Dull....,"Demi Moore is fantastic, but the over all story was just plain boring. It seemed forever for anything to happen after the intitial opening incident.The locations and lighthouse was beautiful......but.......With a little added punch, I might have liked this sleeper."
2,very predictable,"You could see the ending coming a mile away. I won't give spoilers for those who haven't seen it. Its not a terrible movie, its just that I felt the story was recycled from several other movies. (At times, I felt I was watching other movies).Demi was great as usual, and the filming locations were beautiful, but the plot was borrowed at best. Ending was a let down."
2,It COULD have been good...,"This movie was not suspenseful and I did not believe Demi Moore's character for a second. At times I felt the makers of this film were just trying to fill the running time in any way they could. Also...the dialogue? Bleh. Sample--HE-""Then I'll know all about you."" SHE-""Maybe."" Later...SHE-""So, do you know all about me now?"" HE-""Maybe"". Seriously, don't waste your time."
4,Deffinatly worth owning.,"For only a penny at the moment, i'd take it. It's really good. Nothing inappropriate and very entertaining. plot kinda goes everywhere, but still easy to understand, and im 16....so good buy!!"
1,I DON'T THINK SO,"I liked the cinematography but the movie as a whole, in my opinion, is just another Demi Moore stinker. As a mother myself I was appalled at the lack of emotion the mother (Ms. Moore) demonstrated at the loss of her only son. And to get into a love relationship shortly thereafter? A real mother in the same situation would be completely immobilized. The devastation from losing a child would be heart-breaking and of long duration. It would rule your every waking moment for years. I felt none of this from Demi Moore's character or the movie. In a film, it is difficult to successfully combine the plot of the loss of a child with sex and suspense. In ""Halflight"" it certainly doesn't work.Demi Moore is quite pretty in the film and the scenery is charming. It's an interesting little film about intrigue, but it disappointed me on the one important level. Because of that I found Demi Moore's character to be unsympathetic and unbelievable.Rent, don't buy."
2,half light half baked,"Hard to believe this movie is averaging 3.5 stars. The story was interesting but it is hard to watch a ""plastic"" forty something romancing this your man. I thought demi's acting in the scary scenes seemed wooden and not very interesting. She is another of the gaunt actresses looking like they have protein calorie malnutrition. This movie was definitely a replay TV skip mode movie. That is, when it starts to drag, just skip 30 seconds (about 10 times). I enjoyed the local color characters the most. They seemed real. Demi always seems to have a hard time actually carrying a movie.Wouldn't recommend this one except in skip mode."
1,long very long,"Not terrible, I actually watched the whole thing but it was very long. Two hours, I think. Demi Moore worked okay for the role. A lot of character development, possibly to a fault. Boring. Still didn't get an answer to several questions and a new character introduced with 15 minutes left. Kinda dumb really."
5,a smart thriller,"Beautifully shot, great twists and turns, a surprisingly emotional performance by demi... this movie really delivered."
3,Good Thriller,"I found this movie intriguing and watched it from front to back.It was dark and sometimes a little slow but overall, the conceptwas good if not sad, and the ending was a surprise."
2,Not up to snuff,"...with the Demi of ""Ghost"" or ""Seventh Sign"". I was disappointed to say the least. Although I did watch the entire movie - it was only because I kept hoping it would get better. And it just did not..."
4,Half Light Pleasant Surprise,"What a pleasant surprise... script, setting, photography, acting, nothing truly outstanding yet all fit together for me like a deep, slowly moving river...a cerebral, visual, audio and intellectual meditation. Much of the innuendo of the script was obvious, much was not, found myself enjoying the second guessing to the ending. One never knows...ah cannot give anything away, for me it was good, I felt good at the ending, listened to the music while reading the credits, the mellowness like after a long run...endorphin doing their thing. This is a ""dare to try it movie""...try it at the right time and be surprised by joy, or at least the warmth of a nice merlot."
1,Half Light,"Half Light....should be called Half Awake! To be polite this movie was T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E....Other than Demi Moore having her name associated with this film; nothing else was remotely memorible. The one positive to this movie was the location seemed quite beautiful, I often found my mind drifting and thinking about how this movie should be at the bottom of this serene ocean in the United Kingdom. With my feelings put aside, this movie is about a novelist (Demi Moore) who lives in London and tragically looses her son in an drowning accident. To cope with her grieve she moves to a remote Island to learn more about Light Houses which is featured in her upcoming novel. The plot (which I will not give away) is predictable and if I did give it away you the reader will be glad I warned you. Charactors in the film were very forgetable to say the least..."
2,"Like A Lifetime Network Movie, For Hardcore Demi Fans Only",This is very similiar to made-for-TV movies as shown on the Lifetime TV network. Almost every man is evil. Demi gives a wooden performance. The movie does a good job of capturing the mood of seclusion and beautiful seaside scenery with cold weather. For Demi fanatics only.
3,full screen version / not remastered,"Interesting movie! Film adaptation from the novel by D.H. Lawrence, starring Joanna Shimkus and Franco Nero.Unfortunately this is not a remastered version,and it's a full screen 4:3 presentation (only opening titles are ""widescreen"")."
5,Awesome,"Beautiful Watch, can't believe it was offerred at this price! Like previous comments, watch has more of a mirror like finish than what looks like a satin finish in the photos. Still an absolutely beautiful watch! Have received so many compliments! Thank you so much"
1,Disappointing,"This novel has an amusing premise - a band of bachelors who form a support network for men who are on the brink of proposing to females. The main character of the book is a man who has been married numerous times because he feels uncomfortable when there are silences in the conversation with an unmarried female companion. To break this awkward silence and to open a minefield of discussion, he proposes to them. He is on the brink of falling into this trap again and that is where the book begins. Despite this promisingly amusing beginning, the book does not succeed in holding the reader's attention. You are glad that it's all finally over, as the book struggles laboriously to its all-too-distant end."
4,An easy read if you appreciate art.,An easy read if you appreciate art. I liked that it tried to describe each painting and even showed them in the book. It really took me back to that time. This was a well written flowing book.
4,Delightful read,"I wasn't familiar with Harriet Scott Chessman until I won an autographed copy of Lydia Cassatt Reading the Morning Paper and now I find myself wondering why. In a word, this book is delightful. The writing is artistic and the photos of Mary Cassatt's paintings that are featured are stunning. This book is a fictional account of the relationship between the American Impressionist artist Mary Cassatt and her sister Lydia. It is set in France in the late 1800's and focuses on five paintings Mary did of Lydia during that time. Mary and Lydia had an incredibly close bond that only sister's can share. Lydia was Mary's favorite model and sometimes struggled to pose because she was battling Bright's disease, which eventually took her life.This book is helps you imagine what it was like in Paris in the late 1800's. I felt like I knew the Cassatts by the time I was through. It is a wonderful story of family, love, strength and endurance. I will definitely be looking for more of Harriet's work."
4,Sweet and simple,"Just a sweet and simple book about sisterly love and having to face one's own mortality. Lots of metaphoric prose and colorful descriptions. A small insight into the world of art and artists. Subtly presented, yet deep in meaning and insightfulness. Can easily be read in a couple of hours."
1,Mary Cassatt is rolling in her grave...,Chessman does not do women any favors in her erroneous portrayal of Mary Cassatt and Degas. Cassatt was entirely modern by proving that a woman could have a career and be happily single.
3,Lyrical Tale of Sisterly Love,"I was a huge fan of Tracy Chevalier's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", so I was most interested to read Harriet Chessman's novel about Mary Cassatt and her sister Lydia - the inspiration for many of her impressionist paintings. Chessman's style is elegant, and spare, and she limns a portrait as lovingly as Cassatt painted Lydia. If I have any criticism, it's that I wished the novel had a broader scope - it covers a very brief period when Cassatt and her family lived in Paris. I wanted to know more about the family before they came to Europe, and how at that time in history a woman was able to rise to such prominence in the epicenter of the birth of modern art. Chessman is an accomplished writer, and yet the book is not as deeply felt as it could be, perhaps because of its brevity. Still, it is a tale well worth the telling, and a pleasure to read."
5,Best book I've read all year---and I read a lot!,"This compassionate, beautifully written tale celebrates life, death, art, poetry, and sisterhood. It lacks the bitterness of Girl with a Pearl Earring, which I didn't care for at all. You will never look at these paintings in the same way again. It also reminded me of the beauty of what my own sister left behind. Many thanks to the author for such a compelling book."
3,Where does the romance occur?,"It was o.k. I just really missed the part where they fell in love. As they are threatening each other and yelling, they are thinking of their unrequited love. The conflict went on way too long without depth to the plot showing the growing of their love. Yes, Viking stories can be harsh, but these are, after all, men. They have feelings and enjoy family( the author even makes note of this with the brother Eric)."
4,Nice historical read,"Graham does a nice job setting the scene. The cultural conflicts between the Irish and the Viking characters are well played out, with complex characterization and nice images. Strong male/female protagonists and interesting supporting characters. I think this is the first in a series."
5,Absolutely the very best book!,"I only wish this book was in hardcover. It is one of my favorites. If you like vikings you will love this series. Even though I do not like paperback books, this one is a ""keeper""!"
4,Golden Surrender,"This book being Heather Grahams first attempt at historical romance, she sure hit it on the head with belivable characters and description one can picture in one's mind."
4,An enjoyable romantic read...,"This mixture of romance, history, and war turned out to be a very good historical romance. The two main characters, Erin and Olaf, are both strong-willed, proud and stubborn which made for some interesting feuding from the very beginning. The author fleshed them out enough to make you care about them, and like them both.Aside from the romance, which was very good, there were also some pretty interesting battle scenes as war raged on between the Vikings and the Irish. (Don't worry, these scenes aren't overlong.) The author did a good job of conveying the pride and dignity of both sides in the warring.I must admit I was slightly irritated by a few things Erin did, but I quickly overcame my irritation because of the interesting way that the situations were resolved. This irritation was also overshadowed by some of the admirable actions that Olaf took.In sum, if you like historical romances, this is a book worth reading."
3,Not a page-turner.,"I liked the story, but it didn't flow right. It also lacked humor and humility. I didn't get Erin at all.It was strange to see how much the male character grieved for and adored his first love. That's rare, and I'm telling ya, it ruined the story early on. More in this series? if I see the next at a sale, maybe."
4,amazingly compelling.,"It clearly teaches that there isn't such a thing as a deviant behavior,as the title strongly suggest. At least during the time you watch the dvd. The film may be very upsetting , if taken seriously,but it's unlikely to happen."
2,squirell trap,trap arrived in good shape--but the trip plate was so that that the squirrels could walk on it and not set if off--every day the bait was eaten and no squirrels in the trap--had to do some bending and adjusting to catch any at all--all in all--it is poorly made or adjusted
3,Damaged item,"I RECEIVED MY ITEM IN A TIMELY FASHION, HOWEVER IT ARRIVED DAMAGED.IT WAS STILL USABLE BUT THE CORNER AT THE BACK WAS CRUSHED ,I KEPT IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO CAPTURE THIS ANIMAL IMMEDIATELY AND HAD NO TIME TO FOOL AROUND RETURNING AND WAITING FOR THIS ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED . BI WAS NOT HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE THOUGH.FRANKLY I REALLY DON'T THINK ANYONE GIVES A HOOT ABOUT MY REVIEW.PROBABLY BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO KEEP MY PURCHASE .I SAVED YOU ALOT OF PAPER WORK DIDN'T IANDY FILTONHavahart 1078 Professional Style One Door Cage Trap for Rabbits, Skunks and Large Squirrels 24 x 7 x 7"
3,So far I haven't caught anything,The mesh is big enough for grey squirrels to just reach in and take the bait. I tried putting it inside a tin can and they rolled the trap around to get it- demolishing a flower bed in the process. So far I'm disappointed. I'm going to try to smear peanut butter directly on the plates and see what happens.
5,Squirrels Beware,"This trap is the perfect size for gray squirrels. Using unsalted roasted peanuts in the shell as bait, caught 11 in a two week period. As one of the other reviewers suggested, I used a 1/4 in stick as a shim under the handle when setting the trap to decrease the amount of pressure needed on the treadle to spring the door. The trap is sturdy and well constructed."
4,Havahart 1084,"I've been having problems with squirrels for some time and had a 50 year old double door trap that simply wore out. I ordered the 1084 from Amazon. In the first 2 days I caught 2 squirrels. The second squirrel was caught with no bait in the cage. Late in the 2nd day I noticed that the unit had triggered with nothing in it. I found that the cable that holds the trap door open had pulled out of the weight that holds the trap door down. It appears to be 18 gauge stainless braided cable. I requested a replacement from Amazon and it arrived in 3 days. Since then I'm averaging a squirrel a day (4 more as of today). I really like the unit and with the exception of the broken cable it has performed great. I'm still holding my breath on the cable issue as it appears to be a bit of a weak link. I'm giving this unit a 4 only because of the cable concern. Otherwise it would be a 5. Amazon, though, stood behind this unit 100%."
2,Easy to setup but not trapping,"I bought this and everything looked fine no damage. But after I found out my dad had what I think is a 1089 he wasn't using. So I have been using both. So far I have caught 6 squirells and 2 rabbits. I have only caught one squirell with my 1084. It has also been ""triggered"" mutiple times without any annimals. I don't know how they did it but they did. I think it might be too short. I also haven't had any trouble both bigger animals getting in there like skunk or raccoon, knock on wood. Maybe it's all in the bait. But the 1084 is a little easier to set, and release So I would recomend the 1089 over this just my opinion. I did this on my iPhone so I apologize for any typos or grammar issues cause I'm not going back to correct em."
3,Just OK,"Bought the ""easy set/release"" trap thinking it would be less stressful on animal and user. The release mechanism is much too insensitive for squirrels. I made a couple low-tech fixes and was able to relocated the problematic rodents but don't expect the trap to work as stated right out of the box."
2,Didn't work on rabbits for me!,"The design and appearance looks great, but after trying for 3 weeks to catch the rabbits killing my grass (pee & poop)I never caught a single rabbit. I did however...feed the rabbits as some morning I'd come out and the apples would be gone or mostly eatin from the very back of the trap."
5,Very Nice.,"This is a nice stand. The bottom of it is weighted enough to hold up my Shure 55H, Series II Microphone which is quite heavy.It also looks nice on my office desk, with the solid black base and the chrome extension.I use it to put the mic in front of my guitar amp to record and it works nicely for that as well.I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a desktop mic stand."
3,Good for Kindle,"It was really nice to be able to highlight parts and skip ahead with the table of contents and search options, but it was not good for having book discussions. Everyone would reference a page number and I would have to guess where they were. There are no page numbers in here, so if you're looking to use this for a class or book discussion, just go with the paperback or hardcover versions."
2,only one great,"this collection contains one great story: what was it?. diamond lens has a good start, build up nicely, but ends up being mediocre. none of the other stories are really wort mentioning."
4,Sigma 105 macr ver Nikon micro lenses,"I need a Macro lens for my Nikon D-60 So I looked at the Nikon AF-S VR 60mm, the Nikon 105 AF-S VR lenses and the Sigma 105 macro lense.The sigma is missing some fetures of the Nikkor lenses, however in macro work you are normal using AP mode and manual focus. I feel the 105 lenses work at more flexable distance from the subject, the quality of the immage between a the nikon 105 and the Sigma is nearly identical. But difference in price is inportant to me. Summar, the sigma has a signifant price/performance edge of the Nikon competers."
4,Good for the money.,"I paid $380 for a used lens that looked brand new out the box. At that price I had to buy it. The lens takes great pictures but it is a subsitute for the Nikon VR 105mm. The virbration reduction is the only thing missing. I have to shoot more off the tripod for shots like ring and marco shoots. The Nikon lens saves me a little more time. If you have the money buy the Nikon lens. However, If money is a concern the Sigma 105 is a great buy. The question would I recommend this lens to someone? YES! Am I happy with this lens? YES!"
4,Great lens for the money.,I bought this lens for macro work after I saw the photos of a member of my camera club made with the same lens. I wasn't disappointed. Photos are sharp & clear.
5,"super sharp, a great value compared to other brands","I previously owned the sigma 150 macro. It was super sharp and awesome in any way, just kind of big and heavy. So I decided to get the 105mm because it's cheaper and lighter, more likely to stay in my bag. The 105 lacks HSM but that's not really a problem for macro where you use manual focus, or for portraits where you don't need fast focusing. The min focus distance is about the same.I didn't get the 60-70mm macros because I also want to use the lens for portraits and 105 is better.I researched the tokina & tamron equivalents but I choose sigma cause it was cheaper. The reviews say they're all about the same. I agree the Tamron 90 macro is better but it's a lot more expensive. Plus I think 105 is better for portraits.Overall I highly recommend this lens for nikons. For canon bodies, the sigmas typically front focus and I would only buy canon lenses (canon has a good 100mm macro)."
4,Great macro lens,"This lens is AWESOME. I had the opportunity to try it last month and I'm really satisfied with the results.**I'm using D40X, so AUTO FUCUS WON'T WORK !! Moreover, I found some dust particles inside the lens when I received it, but it didn't effect the quality of my picz.Other than that, I'm happy to have this lens in my collection."
3,rock hudson movie,the movie was good. it seemed like the movie had been re-recorded off of a copy of the original movie. I still liked it and you could watch it.
1,Worst Language Lessons Ever,"1. There's no basic pronunciation and alphabet lesson - at all - anywhere - especially not on the CD.2. The pronunciation guide is about 4 sentences long, and again there is no audio accompanyment.3. All that's on the CD are the mini conversations at the begining of each of the 30 lessons - one at normal pace and once at a slow pace.4. Lessons include many words that are not introduced through the audio conversations, and absolutely no pronunciation guidance is given.5. It's actually fairly riduculously set up - no one can learn a language in 30 lessons that take a max. of 5 minutes each (or about 2.5 hours total), especially when spread over 30 days and with little review.Basically this is a crappy way to learn German - or to speak and audibly comprehend it. You might come out reading a little. So save your $20ish and buy some weinerschnitzel instead."
2,Difficult (a provisional rating),"I learn langauges by listening and repeating, as well as by reading, but grammar comes more slowly to me and I'm finding this book difficult. I think there's too much grammar too quickly for someone trying to get comfortable in German for travel. I think the lessons also get too long too quickly. However, the CD dialogues are well-paced, repeated, and clear. I'm not convinced this was the best choice for me, but it may work better for others."
5,Frommer's Scotland,"Of all the travel books I purchased for my first trip to Scotland, the Frommer's edition is the one I used and kept after my trip. It is comprehensive, detailed, and gives good advice. It had all the attractions I wanted to visit and more. They also have a great website as a reference tool."
4,Still need a more complete Rick Steves guide,"As good as this guide is, it still leaves me with unanswered questions. We are traveling by rail, and this and the other guides assume that all travel by car. I need to know, as I would find out from Rick, where the train station is in relation to the accommodations."
4,Useful for Planning,"Purchased this book to help with planning for a forthcoming trip to Scotland. Seems fairly informative, but can only really review it after taking the trip."
2,Badly miked. Mundane performance.,"After playing this, I had to get my head straight by playing my Klemperer EMI version. The difference is night and day, both performance and engineering-wise. The Muti mikes seem to be right in front of the brass, to the point that we can't hear all the wonderful things the rest of the orchestra is doing. I have always loved Bruckner brass, but never realized that there could be too much. Klemperer and EMI do everything wonderfully. The hall ambience and decay at the end of each movement is quite nice.There are other better performances, too, such as Karajan, Mehta, Jochum, Solti, Furtwangler, for example.I would give it three stars(""Its OK"") for the performance, but the miking (or post-production fiddling) drops it one star."
3,love to read,this book was very long and drawn out. it was not what i thought it would be. the story just seemed to go on foreveruntil about the end.
4,Nice Feeder,"It really does keep the squirrels at bay which is quite an accomplishment . The birds don't seem as enthralled with this feeder however , that is why the 4 star instead of 5 star rating . Overall , I would recommend this feeder ."
1,TERRIBLE - design flaw!!,"I have 3 (successful) birdfeeders and go through lots of seed. This nice looking metal, sturdy, 'squirrelproof' feeder caught my eye. (I paid more than here on Amazon,too) I've had it for 6 months, through an entire spring/summer/fall cycle, rotated sites, rotated seeds. I firmly believe it's a design flaw. The little perchs are too small for larger birds to sit comfortably and eat the seed. The space between the bottom seed tray and the metal openings are too deep. The birds need to reach down nearly 1 inch to get the seeds - too deep for the little birds. I've even found the spring-loaded cage locked closed after a squirrel had tried to get to it -the cage never sprang back up to allow access to the seed.PLEASE save your sanity and purchase a different feeder!!Molly in Minnesota"
4,"Not perfect, but a good try","This lasted two summers until the squirrels figured out that gnawing the plastic seed catcher on the bottom would cause all the seeds to fall out. The good part about this is that it kept the squirrels intrigued long enough for me to be able to shoot them. This definitely prevented repetition, one squirrel at a time."
2,Bird Feeder,I was very disappointed in the produst and the lack of information for setting it up The squirrel proof apparatus I had to try and figure out myself since there were no directions. Now I see the birds cannot get at the seed to eat it. There is the same amount of seed as when I filled it 4 weeks ago. As a new customer I am really disappointed. If I buy from Amazon again I hope I will get more satisfaction from the product.The bird feeder looks nice but is not functional. I am contemplating breaking it open to try to modify it so the birds can get to the seed.
2,Keeps Squirrels out but where are the birds?,I bought 2 squirrel proof feeders and this one may keep the squirrels out but it does nothing to attract birds. The feed holes at the bottom of the feeder seem to be too hard to get food from therefore the birds congregate on my other feeder which works great! I would not recommend this feeder.
2,Squrrirel feeder,I'd rate it higher but it doesn't stop the Squirrels. Does a good job of feeding both the birds and them.
1,Most Squirrel FRIENDLY feeder on the market,"The squirrels have no problem with this feeder. They just perch off to one side of the feeder which keeps the door from closing. It is kind of fun watching those bushy tailed rats scoop fist-full after fist-full of seeds out of the dispenser and onto the ground. The crows just hang out on the ground and wait for the squirrels to do all the work. Everyone seems to love this feeder other than the song birds I was hoping to cater to. I may try to re-engineer this thing, or I may just throw it away."
1,squirrel proof feeder ????????????,Our squirrels are much too smart for this feeder.It is being returned today.
3,Not what I expected.,"The exercises are fine, but I can't stand the model. I think she was told to keep smiling at all times, I watch her and it looks too much like a grimace. No one holds a smile that long...she never stops and I continue to look away from the screen. I also wish they had let her explain the moves, it would have looked natural. A small thing to some people I know, but it really bothers me. But for the purpose for which it was made its very good."
3,Very adequate routine,"We were satisfied with the exercise program, but wished the production values were a little more sophisticated. A little more variety would have made it more interesting. All and all though, the program did the job."
5,The Catholic Living Bible: Paraphrased,This bible does a wonderful job of interpreting scripture in an easy-to-understand language. I highly recommend it to anyone wishing to deepen their knowledge of the bible.
2,Its a so-so book.,"The book reads OK. There is little character development and not really much interesting about the main character. Keough is pretty lonely and boring. He doesnt do any great detective work that would make the book stand out. The serial killer is an idiot who makes a lot of mistakes and really isnt very difficult to catch. The book reads like watching a OK episode of Law and Order. Also, like another reviewer wrote, the descriptions and actions of the St Louis police force seem a little unbelievable. They seem bumbling in comparison to his ""normal"" activity. This also takes away from the novel."
1,Related or Illiterate,Skip this one. Anyone who finds any part of this book even remotely believable is either related to the author or cannot read. His bumbling St. Louis police force is ridiculous.
1,In the shadow of Joe's amazing hunches.,"The main character, Joe Keough, does very little (if any) actual detective work in this rather tepid novel.Amazingly, both the multiple murder investigation and the events surrounding little Brady Sanders manage to solve themselves with minimal input from Detective Keough. Joe is simply there to act on his outlandish hunches and pick up all the credit. This comes even at the cost of a fellow officer. But hey, it was the one detective on the force that all the men and women didn't really care for anyway, so what's the big deal, right?In reality, all Joe Keough has in this story are his hunches. He even goes so far as to tell this to his superiors and the FBI.The supporting cast of officers are ineffectual, as is the story's villain. It is for these reasons that I cannot in good conscience recommend this novel."
3,Great book but make sure you buy the MOST RECENT Version,"This book is great. Just make sure you buy the most recent edition of it. The authors are re-assess the quality of their recommendations every few years, so make sure you get a recent copy for the most accurate information.The book format gives a personal overview of the island that's easy to follow. The first half of the book gives a detailed description of the island from Shore to Shore, and the latter half breaks down into chapters like ""Activities"" by Type (Helicopter, Scuba, Hiking, etc.), ""Beaches"" - with lots of detail, ""Dining Out"", ""Nightlife"", and ""Where to Stay""Very helpful book!"
3,"The Maps are great, but.....",".....as a resident of Kauai I can attest to the fact that people here don't appreciate trespassers and that's my major beef with this guidebook. The authors seem to take delight in directing tourists to tromp across private property to gain access to hidden sites. This is irresponsible and it really irks the locals.The restaurant reviews are outdated and subjective; I usually don't agree with them but this is a tricky area due to constant change in management.The maps are really first rate, great detail, easy to read.Please be careful at places like Polihale and Queens Bath---way too many tourists have suffered serious injuries at these highly touted spots. (Kipu Falls, on private property is super dangerous.)"
5,Excellent book!,"My boyfriend and I purchased this book for our trip to Kauai in Oct. 2001. It had great maps, good descriptions of hiking trails and beaches, and had excellent restaurants listed - we tried many! We also purchased Horowitz's 16th ed. of the Kauai Underground Guide, which had more info on restaurants, but if you want one book, buy the Ultimate Guide!"
4,Great guide,This guide was great for its maps to beaches and trails!It should be the only guide book you need for kauai.
2,dead end,We didn't appreciate the way this book took us to so many places that had private property and no trespassing signs. Good colorful maps though.
2,Outdated information,"This book, 3rd edition was published in 1999. It is NOT current. I bought it ""used"" for a cheap price. Now I know why it was so cheap! I've just ordered the current edition(7th)on Amazon. Lesson learned - check publishing date when you need a book/info that is up-to-date."
2,Not so hot,"I was quite disappointed with the Ultimate Kauai Guide. Its advice was anything but ""ultimate."" The guide did not provide enough information to be truely helpful. The resturant reviews did not provide very much detail. The hikes were not all that they cracked up to be. For a more in depth look at what Kauai has to offer, check out The Kauai Underground Guide."
1,A Poor Choice,"I have to agree with the reader from California (December 3): ""Ultimately"" a waste of money (and time, I might add). On our recent vacation to Kauai, we were sorely disappointed with the advice and biases in this book. A poor choice indeed, for which we have no one to blame but ourselves. But here's some advice for fellow travelers: definitely avoid this book (and some of the other disorganized ones as well), and get the free brochures that are so readily available all over the island. Also, buy the University of Hawaii maps: an excellent value if you are exploring the island on your own (not on an organized tour). By the way, Kauai is a beautiful island, the experience of which you should not dilute with the ""Ultimatelies"" of the world."
1,Some Poor Advice,"""Ultimately"" a poor use of money. Advice on activities (especially helicopter tours aka Air Kauai) was dead wrong. Book did not warn us of dangers at its ""real gems"" and was way off on the friendliness of the people (I lost track of how many haole comments I heard behind my back). Maybe this is more of a commentary on my displeasure with Kauai but this book had really convinced me that it was a great place. My advice: stick with Maui."
1,what's going to destroy Hawaii?,"Which naturalist was it said, ""I love the mountains, that's why I never go there..."" ? Well Doughty and Friedman may have found a fun way to fund their fun, but publishing a book enticing more people to rent cars in a place where cars ought to be restricted, and visit places that can't support a great deal of visitation is irresponsible. They love Kaui? Then they ought to stay away from it and not encourage hundreds of thousands of others to go to places with an ecology that can't support their tourism."
5,a great travel guide,"I randomly picked up an earlier edition of this guide up before I went to Kauai for the first time. What a good buy! I now own the whole series of guides. In the end we left our copy with local friends, because they were still reading it, when we had to return from paradise. One caveat is that some of the food reviews from the 3rd edition are getting out of date (proprietors have changed, moved, or closed up shop), and the guide is so heavily used now you can expect to see folks in some of the more remote places with the ""blue book"". The hotel listings run to the expensive/resort side so if you're looking for cheap things or B&Bs you may want to buy an extra book."
4,There's no pricetag for detail,"My wife and I just returned from Kauai on 5/30/01 and had a great time, much of that due to this book. The detailed directions to the hiking trails were amazing! Without these directions some of the hidden trails (""The Jungle Trail"") we hiked would have been lost. The detail continued to all other aspects of the book helping us feel like seasoned veterans of the island rather than bumbling tourists. The reason for 4 stars VS 5 is due to some of the inaccurate restaurant ratings. I agree with another reviewer when they stated this probably couldn't be helped due to the constant changing of management. But in all fairness to the restaurants that have changed their ways for the better I would like to mention to the new readers to assess the establishment before shrugging it off. We found one in particular our last day in haste that the book frowned upon that was quite excellent. Overall....GREAT BOOK!"
2,Disappointing,"Kauai is such a wonderful destiniation. I had a great vacation, but I was disappointed in this book as it failed to lead me to the best restaurants on the island. When I visit a new location, in this case Kauai, I like to experience the great cuisine that such new location has to offer. This book failed to lead me in the right direction as far as restaurants were concerned. The only way that I was able to find my favorite dining destinations was through the recommendations of the consierge of the Princeville Hotel. The consierge also let me borrow a copy of his Kauai Underground Guide - which he says is the most accurate book on the island and which he loans to guests who ask for advice on restaurants, beaches and adventures. He was right on."
5,Absolutely outstanding!!!!!,This is truly the best guidebook for Kaua'i!! We took it everywhere with us and found the maps to be very accurate and easy to read. All of the reviews of restaurants and activities were right on the money. We were travelling with an infant and really appreciated the breakdown of activities and adventures sections. I strongly urge anyone travelling to the island to bring this guidebook with them!!!! It is indispensable!!!
5,The Ultimate Honeymoon,"I can't tell you how wonderfully this book enriched our honeymoon ...everything that was recommended was easy to find, follow, and all of the selected vendors were a perfect match. The entire series of these books are bibles for your travels in Hawaii...of all the locals I spoke to, they also chose these books. I just bought Maui Revealed and can't wait to use it as I've been there many times...hoping they will share some secrets I have yet to discover."
5,Ultimate Kauai Guidebook,"I just purchased this book, and it's definitely the best Kauai guidebook I've seen. You can tell the authors really love the island and know it well. I have made 4 trips to Kauai in the past 6 years, and found the authors' comments and reviews to be on-the-mark about virtually everything that I have experienced. This makes me excited about my upcoming trip this summer because I feel I've been steered toward some new finds."
3,Useful Diabetes Reference,Vwey complete. Answers many question about diet. Purchase well swrth the money. Would recommend to others who need guidance about diets for Type 2 diabetes.
2,The New Glucose Revolution:The Authoritative Guide to the Glycemic Index--the Dietary Solution for Lifelong Health,"I purchased this book because I had read about the Glycemic Index in my diabetes magazines, and although I didn't understand the information well, I did think it might be useful. I was disappointed. My primary concern is that, as described in the book, the Glycemic Index Values are determined by far too small a sample, and with rather vague criteria. I also disliked the style of the book, which seemed to promise a cure for everything from obeisity to hangnails. In the end, I didn't finish the book, but am keeping it in hopes that the values in the back, although questionable, might be useful."
2,Not worth the read.,I read this book at the recommendation of my doctor to try to get a handle on high glycemic foods in my diet. The book spends too much time on telling you all the ways that the glycemic index is not measured or affected instead of clearly coming to the point in a clear and concise way. I felt more confused after reading the book than before.
5,excellent,the book is well written and is chock full of good information. A must read for people who look to improve their health.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered the New Glucose Revolution because a friend of mine had a copy, and it contained the most comprehensive glycemic index listing of foods that I had ever been able to find. When I received my copy it was a later edition and omitted many of the items that the earlier book had included. I would have returned it, but laziness set in, and so it sits on my shelf, unused. Thanks, Gai Klass"
2,great book slow delivery,This book is super and full of information. But it took too long getting here. The seller was within their rights but I think shipping right away is a big plus.
3,Where's the USA Info?,This book is ok. I like the Low Glycemic concept. I didn't like the fact that most of the foods listed are from Australia. I would have liked a USA version. They only listed the most popular US foods. I'm glad I didn't buy the hard copy from Prevention. I found a paper back for less than 1/2 the price.I enjoyed the G-Index Diet much better. I'll probably follow that one more. The menues were good!
2,"Good info, Hard to access","While this book did have a lot of useful information and the explanations were thorough, one of the biggest selling factors for me was a comprehensive and well researched GI and GL list of foods.Unfortunately, the publisher has pasted these lists as pictures which means a) It can't be enlarged and b) It isn't indexed and cannot be searched in your kindle. This is a MAJOR drawback. If your eyesight isn't great and/or you simply want too look up a food quickly without having to scans many pages you're out of luck. This seems to be an oversight that should have been recognized earlier. Perhaps they didn't feel like investing in the labor to do a proper digital transfer."
5,NEw Glucose REvolution,"I was recently diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes. This book has helped my learn more about how my body reacts to the various foods that quickly elevate by blood sugar. This book has not completely solved by issues, but it has shed a lot of light on what I need to do the maintain a healthier blood sugar level.The book is well written and authoritative. I am very glad that I read it."
2,not for everyone,"This book is not for everyone. It is very technical. I can comprehend almost anything, but there is a lot of thinking that goes into the chemical issues."
2,"It might be better than nothing, but...","I found this book only marginally useful and informative. I've read it after I finished another book ""Primal Body - Primal Mind"", which covers some of the same theories, but so much more intelligently, in depth, and with many more references to actual research."
2,not too helpful,For everyday help in changing your eating habits I found this book fell short. It did have a few helpful things but over all I didn't find it informative.
2,Boring,"Why can't they put this into simple language. If you are a doctor or dietician, this might be understandable, but to the regular person, this is just plain boring. There must be another more easily understood book on the subject out there."
2,leaves me no wiser,I agree with the other reviewer who talks about contradictions. Nourishing traditions was a much better book on nutrition.
2,Confusing,Confusing and dissappointing. I couldn't make heads or tails of this. The structure of the book dosen't make sense. Too bad.
3,Not what I thought it would be,"Considering it was used and cheap, it's okay. The listings of GI are very limited and honestly, things a person with a blood sugar concern really shouldn't be eating. As I don't have another book on the topic, I'll keep it as reference for now but I'm still looking for a more comprehensive book on the subject."
5,British Dazzler,"This paperback was a random gift - and was an astonishing delight. This is a well executed novel of macabre and even gruesome subject; but it pulls one in with its invention, insight, and sympathy of its characters. There is extensive philosophical inquiry - and a new villain (the tattoed man) who stands out among media stereotypes. Cross reminds me of some aspects of Patricia Highsmiths best work (Ripley Under Water)in that nightmarish quality come true to life but the logic and construction in Mr. In Between is even more compelling...and this work stands on its own as an original work.If you have any taste for futuristic crime fiction with heatlhy doses of social realism (including blunt descriptions of violence and drug use) and imaginitive writing.....seek out this book as it is a jewel"
4,Strength Training,"I needed something to get me started on lifting weights and this was pretty good. Very easy to follow and terrific workout. If you are looking for a challenge, this is it."
3,"She's strange, but the workout is ok for beginners","I recommend this for beginners to sculpting workouts. Sunshine is weird and the Dvd is very low-budget, but the workout is ok."
3,Same as othern tape,"I like her other tape, but this one seems to be almost exactly the same except for more reps of the exercise. I could do that with the first one."
4,Great Basic Workout,"This is a great no-nonsense workout. If you are looking for a basic workout DVD that will give you a full body workout in a short amount of time, this is it. The moves are shown and explained very well."
5,*** Hold'em Poker Books Don't Get Any Better Than This ***,"""Hold'em Poker"" by David Sklansky is about as good as poker books get. This is not a Johnnie-come-lately effort trying to cash in on the new found popularity of Hold'em Poker. This is a solid classic that has been around for a while.Even though this book has some age on it, the odds and probabilities in Poker haven't haven't changed, and neither has the value of this book. If you are going to play Hold'em for money, this is an essential book.This is an fundamental background work, necessary homework for serious Poker players. It is not a simple, entertaining read. It contains real information that requires serious consideration.Failure to read and understand this book will put you at risk of being a ""producer"". One losing session will cost you many times the price of this book."
3,Good info but not clearly presented,"Sklanky may be a good poker player, but he stinks as a writer. The book is confusing and offers very litte in the way of helping a novice to understand his terms. Someone just picking this book off the shelf with no prior poker knowledge would be lost. If however, you already have some poker knowledge, and don't mind muddling through his poor examples and confusing writing style, then you can get some good advice out of this book. However there are books out there that have the same information that are better and more clearly written."
2,Out of Date,"This was probably an awesome book when published in 1976, but the book has not been really updated since then, in spite of being reissued in 1997 as a new edition. The only real updating as far as I can tell is the addition of footnotes here and there explaining that some of the specific advice for certain situations may not be valid for the modern double blind structure. This book has a lot of very worthwhile ideas, but most of them are better explained in more detail in Sklansky/Malmuth's Hold'em Poker for Advanced Players, which I highly recommend. Another awesome Sklansky et al book is Small Stakes Hold'em, which I find extremely useful since I don't play in the big leagues. Overall I would rate Hold'em Poker for Advanced Players as much more valuable book than this one, even if you are not yet an advanced player."
3,very difficult read,"This book is close to unreadable. Mr. Sklansky may be the authority on poker, but he sure can not write. There are better books out there which are much easier to read. This book will put you to sleep after giving you a massive headache."
5,Excellent Book for Beginners and Experienced,"I have been playing poker all my life but just started playing Texas Hold'em a few months back. This book gives outstanding information for playing Hold'em. It not only helps you with the fundamentals but it helps you to start thinking of the advance playing strategies. I recommend this book, that is, unless your playing at my table."
3,Classic book now good for a new class.,"This books is not wrong about anything. This book is right about almost everything. Mostly though, this book is great for the beginner. If you play poker for fun, and want to learn more about how to play holdem, this is where to start, and after a while, move to its big brother, Holdem for Advanced players. This book has starting hand requirements that work for most levels of games, and is one of the most in-depth books about how to play that still allows comprehension of the lessons in the book by the layperson.It is not the best book on the subject, but it is by far not the worst. This might be the best first-book on poker for someone, as it is a very good introduction towards the style of most noteworthy poker books, and it doesn't really have too many flaws (in regards to detail).In the areas where this books lacks, just get the Advanced player book, after fully digesting this one, and you will have plenty to chew on."
3,Confusing,This book is a quick course to playing good poker. I am sure all the topics he writes about will make you money. The problem is that he give too little information and examples to fully know how to put the knowledge in to practice right. I really got a headache going through this book and still i am second guessing myself if I am making the right plays. What I think this book lacks is: 1. information about how to deal with certain players 2. how to recognize what kind of game you're in (just talks about loose or tight)If you have the patience to fully understand this book it may be for you.Not a book for beginners!!
2,Difficult reading,I can't say how good the advice in `Hold'em Poker' is. I haven't tried playing for real yet. There's no way I'd risk money with just this book for preparation. It's hard to read and sometimes doesn't make sense even with repeated readings.
2,"Some basic strategy, but the ""updates"" are a joke","This book contains some good information for a complete novice, but most of the intermediate strategy discussed ends up being footnoted as ""No longer accurate due to today's double blind structure"".Well's that's great. The cover of the book says, ""Updated for today's double blind structure"". I think any sane person would expect actual updates to the material, rather than short comments that state that half of the book is no longer valid. It's beyond frustrating.Save your money for something else."
3,Sklansky...great player.....tough read,"The book has obvious merit for its analytics and description of theory but the writing is difficult to say the least.I have read it twice and find this too tough to digest. Compare it to Warren's ""Texas Hold Em Poker"" and it s night and day."
4,A must read for any novice Hold 'em player.,"Sklansky does a excellent job of explaining the game. Although his theory may be complicated and confusing, this book is well worth the read. If a player studies this book, and I mean study, not just read, they will be able to do well enough in nearly any game they enter. I started playing hold 'em a little over 2 months ago (gotta love rounders) and after studying this book I can confidently play in any mid range limit game with the knowledge that I am skilled enough to make money."
2,Great Player - Bad Writer,"This was the first poker book I read and boy was it a mistake.First off 2+2 needs to update their theories on Holdem to today's game. Instead of having foot notes saying ""this"" or ""that"" doesn't apply anymore ""so ignore it"". Why not just re-write parts and print new editions?Second, while I have no doubt the book is chuck full of great poker theory, it is hard to understand the way he presents it. I had read a few reviews above expressing this opinion and purchased this book anyway. I'm sorry I did.All in all, maybe a book worth reading if you have allready read Doyle Brunson's ""Super System"" and Lee Jones's ""Winning Low Limit Hold'em"" and still want more."
2,There are better books by Sklansky,"I found this book very hard to read. The information was poorly presented. I estimate that I read this book three times actually, when you consider the amount of time I spent re-reading the passages trying to understand them. The editor took a month off, I think.The most frustrating aspect was the conflicting information that was presented. Often times Sklansky would teach you a certain way to do things, but then offer alternative scenarios which require the opposite tactic. All this information would be contained in one paragraph. So I was never really sure what the actual advice was.I did, however, also happen to have a copy of Sklansky's ""Theory of Poker"" which I found to be very easy to read, well-arranged, and organized. I suggest you purchase Theory of Poker. It contains all the information in this Hold-em book anyway.Sklansky has great advice to give. You just need to make sure and buy the right book."
