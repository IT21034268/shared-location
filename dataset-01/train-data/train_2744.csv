3,worth reading just for the intro!,"i have a large collection of vegetarian/vegan cookbooks, so this one tends to just stay buried on the shelf. i can't really vouch for its recipes. HOWEVER: the introduction is fabulous. most veggie cookbooks have an intro explaining the benefits of that lifestyle with some tips on making it happen, but this one is the most inspiring, least judgemental one i've ever seen. i've gone so far as to photocopy it and give it to friends to help them with their transition to veggie-ness."
3,"nice to have, but not a must have","the vibration reduction is very light to a point that is not worth it. Any how, I installed it every time to maximized the vision experience."
4,Works but pricey,"These pads do their job well and are perhaps mandatory at higher magnifications. Their effect is more noticeable on hard surfaces that on turf and are more useful there. My only gripe is with the price; they would be a fantastic value and a no-brainer at $25-30 for the set. But for $45-60, I think the manufacturer is making quite a profit for what amounts to jello-filled plastic. That's not to say that these aren't quality pieces, but they aren't carbon fiber either. If you have vibration problems at higher magnification, you'll want them, and fortunately Amazon saves you a few dollars over some other sites."
4,Good for Nexstar Owners (and others),"I bought these for use with a Celestron Nexstar 8SE. The work and you can see tht they do. I upgraded the tripod to a much heavier GPS/Ultima tripod and still found the pads useful.I traded up for a CPC925. The tripod weighs almost as much as the entire stock 8SE setup. I thought this was the end for the pads. Then I caught the video astronomy bug and the pads are back. They help to damp very small movements that you do not notice when looking in the eyepiece, but which are visible when processing frames extracted from a video.I highly recommend these pads. You cannot duplicate the effect with furnature glides and silicon calk."
2,"Bought this a long time ago, a never bought it again!",Bought this or my husband. He hated them. He likes Calvin Klein and said this one was awful. He tried them and we threw them out. He hated it!!
4,Classic songs,Another very good album by Judas Priest. It has very classic songs and its a nice metal album to hear it overall. I like very much Diamonds and rust - Sinner - Here comes the tears - Dissident Aggressor (the best track in their album). The other songs are a little bit average. If you are new start with Painkiller & Sad wings of destiny.
2,Dissapointing release for the metal gods,"To say I was dissapointed in this record is an understatement this record did not live up to Priest's legacy as I thought it would.Priest's second record Sad Wings Of Destiny was so influential to metal and such a timeless classic I expected this to be Sad Wings 2 I was wrong. Needless to say there are some good songs on here(Sinner,Dissident Aggressor) but not stuffed with songs that I can listen to from beginning to end.And the production on here flat out sucks Roger Glover from Deep Purple produced it and it still sounds flat.I love Priest and everything but this doesn't stick out to me as one of their best records try Sad Wings Of Destiny or Stained Class or Hell bent For Leather before buying this."
5,One of the World's Best Opera Companies,"With one of the world's best opera companies performing this eye-popping spectacle, it's no small wonder this is one of Luhrmann's most beloved works. This production, streets ahead of any tired reproduction, restores the poignant message of love in its purist, most random form. Impeccable direction, dazzling designs and superb performances by senior artists of Opera Australia (OA) culminate in one of the finest achievements in contemporary opera direction. Absolutely the best production of 'La boheme' post 1960. The quality of the individual performances is truly breathtaking - these performer's emotional range coupled with phenomenal vocal control allow for possibly the most moving interpretation we have seen for years. An excellent example of fine Australian production - ahead of its time and assembled by and including some of the world's greatest directors, designers and musicians."
3,Miking/Synching,"An affecting performance to be sure, and great fun to watch. But those who remark on Hobson's ""great voice"" should be aware that the singers were either heavily miked or lip-synching to a recording. To the trained ear, Hobson has a tiny, light ""tenorino"" voice that without amplification would be swallowed up in an opera house and buried by an orchestra. No voice can be judged until it is heard in person, sans microphones. Any good tenor can sound as powerful as Domingo or Heppner with plenty of amplification. But the real power of the voice is another matter."
2,Overrated,"DVD looks GOOD. Mimi sounds OK. Rodolpho sings with little strength and less conviction. For those who put more credence in surface quality and less on singing find this Boheme wonderful, but I must caution those prospective buyers who still consider the singing in an opera as first and foremost: you will be disappointed. I bought this and stopped it during the Gelida Manina, as the sound of beautiful music being sung by this Rodolpho was too much to bear. I suppose that the appeal of this version of La Boheme is for young people who long for a classical MTV with pretty faces and not so much talent. Sad."
2,the one to have!? come on! this is opera!,"I will not comment very much, only that I have seen very strange reviews here. Even some people putting this soap-opera effort in a higher position to the GREAT ones (Pavarotti/Freni, for example), which is not only ingnorance, but also offensive to serious opera lovers.I will only say that if you know nothing, and care less about what singing and opera should be, of course this is the one to buy."
5,Superb production!,The Australian Opera production of La Boheme is superb viewing. The singing is moving and the vocal quality excellent - what fabulous singers! Baz Luhrmann created a magical production and every aspiring opera singer should watch how these singers combine the beauty of voice with the demands of acting. Excellent production - bravo!
5,My first introduction to opera...,"I saw this production televised in PBS years back and it was my first introduction to opera...Love and Tragedy: 2 elements Puccini geniusly used to manipulate emotions. This production has updated the opera's setting and casts young singers with fresh voices and energy. I've had this DVD for 2 months now and I just now noticed that Baz Luhrmann directed it. No wonder you could see hints from this opera in Mr. Luhrmann's recent movie, ""Moulin Rouge."" It was nice to see the ""L'amour"" sign again.Anyway, this is a very good opera production with good-looking singers who are also good actors. Their voices reveal that they are a young cast but isn't that what this opera is about? ""Freedom beauty, truth and above all, LOVE."" (Ooops, wrong movie)"
5,Great performances,"What's the point of opera on DVD if the singers aren't reasonably attractive? Everyone here is good looking and just the right age. I don't know if Hobson's voice is too thin for the role, as some people here have said, but it's good enough for me... che gelida manina brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it, and when he sobs at the end, I do too...everyone else in the cast is great...I don't think I'd feel the same if the singers were old and fat. True, Jussi Bjorling's old recordings of this make my hair stand on end even more, but for a visual performance, you can't do better than this, I think."
3,"Good, but I am a little disappointed","This opera is well sung and the music is well played, but I don't care much for Baz Luhrmans staging. In particular I was really disappointed with the overall look of the third act. Traditionaly, this act is an opportunity for the stage people to show off their skills and create a breathtaking outdoor winter scene. This third act looked like it took place in a concentration camp.Another thing I didn't like about this production, is the half-dead Australian audience, who apparently feel that applause is impolite. The only time they reacted was at the end of each act. I never heard any ""bravos"" or ""bravas,"" even though they were clearly deserved.If you are looking for a nice DVD of this opera, I suggest one presented live by the Metropolitan Opera."
5,Electric !,"The singing is wonderful and the acting is superb. The camera shots are very well done (none of that nervous, artsy jumping around that drives me nuts--as in Moulin Rouge). The setting in the 1950's works well because it is not overdone. The subtitles are adequate--although, at times, I wish they were a bit more complete. Every so often, a chorus will sing something without a subtitle. You get the drift, but it would be nice to have the text. Overall, this is a keeper."
2,Disappointing,"I had hoped that this would be an educational video, but there is no exposition on the mechanics or origins of earthquakes. No maps, no diagrams, no explanations. Nothing. What there is is a handful of firsthand accounts -- from various recent quakes -- about how bad being stuck in the rubble was. These are accompanied by cheap and cheesey camra work meant to simulate an earthquake. What real footage there is seems to be (for the most part) from after-action news footage. There was even some footage of a fire in Kobe, Japan that got run backwards: you could see the smoke being sucked into the flames. There's no education here. The message is ""Earthquakes! They're big, they're scary, and they can happen to you!"""
5,One of the best sagas in written form.,"This is the sequel to THE SERPENT (which I also recommend). Cija is now empress of Atlan with children of her own, but that does not stop her adventures. The book expands the Atlan mythos nicely, with many truths beginning to emerge. Yet it is wonderfully paced, with some very good villains and living caricatures (Miss Gaskell always portrays narrow minded peasants rather well). Cija is herself sympathetic and funny and it is easy to cheer for her throughout the book. My only quibble is that Cija does mourn dead friends from her first adventure (Narra, Ums) apart from a minor character. But this book is the best fantasy I have read in a while with a magnetic main character."
3,Just another fighting game,I played this and I think that it's pretty bad. The charachters are very blocky but otherwise the graphics are pretty good. I think that if you want a fighting game get Mortal Kombat. Dark Rift is alright but not great.
2,not a role playing game as its name would suggest,"its a fighter.well,it seems the only video games n64 ever made that were the mk[mortal kombat] series.this is just a cheap rip off.all the things that make a fighting game cool are absent here.just stick with mk."
1,Only 1,"I sent away for this item and only received one alarm, not two. Contacted them and never heard a reply. Buy from someone else."
4,Great sense of privacy,"This product provides me a great sense of privacy and security as I put it under the door every evening, before going to bed. It's a small price to pay for that added 'comfort'."
3,This game is 2D. Don't be fooled.,"Generally I have always like Disney Interactive N64 games but this one was kind of a let down for me. Pretty much the whole game is 2D side scrolling. Pretty much every level consists of just getting from point A to point B. There aren't really any missions to accomplish. On the bright side, it has a degree of challenge in it and it can be oddly addicting. But if you want a really good Disney Interactive game with fun levels full of challenging missions and hours of fun, I would buy the Toy Story 2 N64 game rather than this."
4,Paging Nancy Drew,"In the DVD's delightfully lurid cover art, a shadowy killer strangles a young blonde whose aroused breasts poke through her underwear. An ancient city burns red in the distance. The text promises ""a macabre tale of murder at an all-girls school."" In fact, it's fun tale of murder at an all-girls school. This Italian whodunnit from 1968 is more Agatha Christy than Mario Bava (who wrote some of the story). Charming performances from the young cast, especially the British actress Sally Smith as a Nancy Drew wannabe. Michael Rennie wanders through as an inspector. In Italian, first time in the States in an uncut version. ""Naked You Die"" is the translation of the Italian title. In the States, AIP hacked 15 minutes out of the film and dubbed it ""The Young, the Evil and the Savage,"" which pretty much sums up nothing. Worth seeing for the opening nude bathtube slaying alone."
2,Jasmine,"The last video is Jasmine and it is really good. But I was disappointed in the ""read along"" stories. They were just cheating from the ""Cinderella II"" movie that they made. Not a very good video to own."
4,ThumbbOdy loves me..,"(..Discover Your Inner Wisdom: Using Intuition, Logic, and Common Sense to Make Your Best Choices..Char's beautiFul..) if you have a soft spot for Gene Kelly's brilliant tap dancing and (sure could watch ""SInging In The Rain"" with Mr. Danny Kaye agaiN..) his singing ""SOmebody Loves Me""..than maybe this is or isn't the movie collection foR you: I don't know,I just wanted to use the (Steve Thumb dressed as Celine Dion makes me wonder if I too am nOt a female thumb trapped in a male thumbs body..) pun.""ThUmb Wars"" is a high Tech (Thumbs are sexy..) surge into the Underworld of Dark stuff,Blair (Sarolta DeFaltay has an ((Shout At The Devil)) article in (Spiritual Bathing: Healing Rituals and Traditions from Around the World..) ThumB has (What more do you wAnt?) stonErs..Steve Oedekek (Satanic Horns in air..)roOls.."
5,Quintessential patriotic CDs,"I got this cd set at the Smithsonion in Washington DC I absolutly love it! I lost it in a move and reordered it. My favorite songs have to be ""the deck of cards"",""'what is an American"" and the 'pledge of Allegiance'. This is the only collection I've found them all in one place. I play this collection from memorial to labor day almost every day. I love it that much."
2,Poor Quality Production,"If you're looking for vintage car ads, pass this by. The reproduction quality is very poor. Many of the ads were cropped badly, and much of the text is not readable. It's obvious that many of these must be amateur scans of magazine ads and not the original source material. I'd love to see a professional-quality re-work of this subject matter."
3,Fighting Force,"This game wasn't that bad at all. It's more like a new rendition of the pld CAPCOM side scroller game, FINAL FIGHT. It plays similar to that. It uses the full scale 3-D view and it has a lot more pick up items and the action is very good and it's a great team game.The only reason I'm not really crazy about this game is because it is really long. A friend and I played this game for entire weekend once and we still weren't done with the game. It's not as long as RAMPAGE UNIVERSAL TOUR but I assure you, it was starting to feel like it after a while. At least the really cool weapons and other cool items that you could use during the game made up for it.I'd have to say rent this one first, just to be sure you're going to be feeling it later because like I said, the game is kinda long. I still think it's fun but for gamers that are just looking for a quick fighting buzz, this might not be for you."
4,Not Bad But Boring,It's fun for like the first hour and a half but it gets really boring. Get a friend to play Co-op with you.
4,Upbeat manual on emerging markets - before the meltdown,"This intelligent guide to doing business in emerging markets offers solid, practical tips on market characteristics, strategies, branding, packaging and other down-to-earth subjects. Vijay Mahajan and Kamini Banga opt for a long-range take on prospects in the developing world. The book's handy organization and encouraging words on harnessing emerging markets' potential make it a fine read. getAbstract finds that it presents a well thought-out approach to selling to the developing world, based on useful and rational advice."
5,Good product...not enough space.,"i got this as a hand-me-down from my big bro. he got it for christmas a few years back. its a good player, but it dosent have enough space for the price that it was originaly bought at. i would recomend buying another one, because now they have mp3 players that cost 3 times less and hold 4 times as many songs. all in all its a good mp3 player if you only wanna hold a few songs."
1,GREAT SHOES BUT DO NOT BUY FROM FOOTSMART,These are great shoes but the third party seller (Footsmart) are dreadful. BEWARE BEWARE. I had to exchange the item and was then billed twice. The company is useless. First call they denied charging me and said they didn't have my credit card information. The second call I was transferred suddenly in the middle to someone else. This person said that the fault lay with Amazon. I am amazed that the company was allowed to just charge my credit card and think that they used the information from a previous order to do so. This is the second order that I have placed with Footsmart and their second major screwup. Do not use this provider.
5,Smart Sandal,These shoes are comfortable and look good in casual wear or casual business. I need support and these shoes feel good!!!!
5,sandalias rojas,"Lindas, el color, el estilo, el tamaño, todo perfecto. Estoy feliz con este producto y se lo recomendaría a todas mis amistades."
4,really cute...,bought these awhile back and they are nicely made and very cute. Small for the price but couldnt find anything else like it that I really wanted. Company was good to work with. No major issues.
4,A great strength training video,"I enjoyed the ""Streamlined"" part of the workout very much. Karen Voight takes you through a quick warm-up and then into standing upper body workout with light hand weight. The mat workout is tough and followed by a good yoga stretch. I have used the ""Streamlined"" workout many times. You can easily increase the intensity by going for a heavier weight.The low impact aerobic section of the ""Strong"" workout is hard to follow and is not challenging enough to Karen Voight's typical audience. The second part of the ""Strong"" workout with weight bar or hand weights is great. The advantage of the DVD format is that you can pick and choose easily without slowing down. A combination of ""Streamlined"" warm-up, ""Strong"" weight bar or hand weights, and ""Streamlined"" yoga stretch add up to be about 60 minutes and provide interesting variation to just the ""Streamlined"" workout."
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,"Karen Voight is a master fitness instructor and in my opinion, the best there is! Her athleticism and precision are so inspiring, and she does an excellent job in all segments of this. This is my absolute favorite workout dvd. Good challenge, good sweating, great feeling afterwards. Get this one, you won't regret it!"
2,Not so impressed,"I must disagree with the other reviewers. The recipes may be great, but I find two flaws. One is that some of the ingredients are not easy to find (unless one is a city dweller) e.g. dried lily petals, red Thai basil, Indian bay leaves, lemon leaves, banana flowers, etc. Secondly, the amounts of each ingredient need interpretation. For example, how much is 1/8 lb. of cellophane noodles, or 1 1/8 lb. of soybean sprouts, or 8 3/4oz. of carrots. Can't they just tell me it's 1/2 cup or a whole carrot or whatever. I don't happen to own kitchen scales and this just makes a lot of extra work. I'm sending it back."
4,Good pail,"This is a great pail. We use regular diapers and biodegradable diapers for our breastmilk-fed baby. So far, the pail has been great. It contains the smell and is inconspicuous. My only complaint is that I would like it to be a bit larger so I don't have to empty it as often."
2,better off with a kitchen trash can,"The pail is so light that it moves around when you try to step on the pedal. Even when it is right up against the wall, you have to push the base of the pail back to the wall (so the bottom isn't flat on the floor) just to be able to press the pedal down, and then the lid still doesn't open far enough to toss in diapers/wipes. Further, the design of the snap-on lid makes it virtually impossible to use a diaper pail liner any thicker than a regular trash bag. I would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone; in fact, I'm going to get a small kitchen garbage can to use instead."
3,Nice size,i like the size of this pail. Our daughters room is small so it doesn't take up too much room.
4,Simple but Good,"Nothing fancy about this pail -- it's just a sturdy plastic pail with a step-lid feature -- but so far, for us, that's been perfect. I like that it takes regular kitchen bags and doesn't require any special inserts. It's also much cheaper than the ""fancy"" models out there. Would give it five stars, except I can see how it wouldn't be as great for a toddler (lid doesn't lock and it's a tad on the small size, which could mean lots of emptying once larger diapers are in use). But for an infant, it serves its purpose well at a fraction of the cost of other diaper pails."
3,ok at first,"We used this diaper pail and thought it was great...at first. Our son is now 9 months old and the smell from the dirty diapers has permeated the plastic and now it always stinks. We tried deo disks, baking powder, carpet cleaning powder, pine-sol, plug-in right over it...but nothing has worked. We even tried putting each messy diaper in one of the sassy bags and that helps with the new scents but nothing will get rid of the old. May work well if you use the scented bags for each diaper combined with this from the very beginning. And to whoever said that baby poo doesnt smell bad...just wait...it will :)"
4,Love it!,"Simple, easy and does the trick. It keeps all the poopy smells inside the pail instead of roaming through the house. :-)"
4,no need to get a fancier diaper pail than this,"This pail does not need special plastic bags--you can use leftover grocery bags, etc., which is a big advantage. I don't know why people buy those diaper pails that individually wraps every dirty diaper--a baby's poop does not smell bad!"
2,"Good for little ones, not so for toddlers...","For a newborn, you can't go wrong. However, once a little one can pull to standing, this pail is a hazard. There's no latching mechanism so interested toddlers can get into the pail (BLECH!!!!) It's also the least stable pail I've used (I'm an Infant Teacher/Caregiver in a preschool) so IF a little one pulls up while nearby, both the child and the pail can topple. I'm really careful, but if I'm changing two babies consecutively, the one NOT on the table will often TRY to get into it... if you have a toddler (or two), go for something more sturdy like the genie, champ or dekor..."
5,Great Product!,"Great product :) I specially like its size, it's big enough, but not so big it is the first thing you see when you enter the room. It also keeps the smell inside it, like other very costly models I've seen, for a fraction of the price. I'm thinking about buying another one soon, I recommend it."
4,Not for cloth diapers that soak,"Someone wrote this is good for cloth diapers. Only if you put them in dry. If you put water (with additive of your choice) to put your diapers in, this is dangerous: babies (ie ones old enough to get about and pull themselves up) have drowned in diaper pails. Esp if they step on the front and the lid pops open and they try to reach inside. headfirst. Only use a diaper pail that latches solidly closed if you are going to put in cloth diapers that you soak. For dry diapers of cloth or disposable variety this is a great buy."
2,What's all the hoopla about?,"Recently, I purchased this and the other two volumes of the triology. I am mid-way through this one (the first) and I am having serious doubts that I'll ever finish it! I had heard rave reviews about it but for the life of me, I can't see why. Being reared on the area that is the setting for the book, I surely thought I'd be able to relate to it somewhat. No such luck! It's almost like being assigned to read Hamlet in high school! The constant stream of correspondence between the characters is distracting at best and seems to be fillers for lack of something better for the author to relay. I'm sorry to say, either my reading taste is too unsophisticated or this is just a plain boring book. Just think: I have two more volumes to go. I can only hope the pace picks up."
2,What is the plot exactly?,"This book made me wish for something more. I never give up on a book 3/4 of the way through it, but I just dreaded reading it. The pace was terribly slow. Price definitely has a talent for assembling words, producing wonderful sentences. He lacks the overall concept of a plot -- does anything ever happen in this book? This is a great book for an insomniac!"
2,Not what I thought,"This book is not good for those people who are looking for a solution. As I was reading this book, I found the author repeating themselves. Also it was a lot of scientific talk.. like the book was directing to other psychologist. I didnt buy this book as a text book for Psych class, but a way to learn how to deal with Trauma. Just wasnt the right book. I hope this helped."
1,CBT as practiced is useless for childhood trauma,"It still uses the Freudian model where the victim is at fault for distorted thinking. But a person who was attacked has every reason to believe that the world is unsafe, for instance - it WAS. If we are going to have cognitive clarity and not distortion, further distortions (mind f*s) are not going to help, and that's what most CBT practitioners offer. Rational thinking can work -- but only if it's true!"
3,A disappointing sequel,"This is the second John Bayley book which centers on his wife's decline from Alzheimer's disease, and the way they managed together through this. The first was a powerful and moving memoir.The sequel unfortunately is a much more scattered, and uncentered work. In fact the greatest part of it does not have to do with the situation of Iris, but rather with Bayley's own story before he knew Iris. Here we are let down simply because Bayley is not a very interesting or appealing character in himself. He seems to be in some way a very tepid and shy character. The book thus only comes alive in the parts which have to do with Iris. But this relationship was probed in a deeper way in the earlier volume. In fact in the earlier volume Bayley seemed to 'have it all together' in a way he does not here."
2,No Xtras on Xtro?,I got this guy cheap like cheaper than buying xtro or xtro/xtro 2 on dvd by themselves so i figured what the hell free skeeter. i had read that both those releases featured some good extra features on the first film which is ultimately the film you are buying this set for.i was flabergasted however to find no extras on the xtro/xtro 2 disc. it makes little sense to me though why they would change the disc after already releaseing the double feature with extras. maybe they are hidden on there somewhere.anyways xtro was fun the other 2 werent so great i would suggest buying the xtro/xtro 2 release so you get some extras. those extra features are probably more entertaining than skeeter and wont waste as much of your time.
3,Skeeter / Xtro / Xtro 2: The Second Encounter,"I've watched the movies before. I remember the first 2 movies. I haven't seen the last one yet, but I will."
5,Works Well,"Once you get the hang of which way to hook the hammer on the stud to straighten it, and use another to drive the nails to hold it in place, you'll wonder why you ever used a wrecking bar and a second person to help.Jack M."
1,Mistake,"It really would have helped had I been sent what I actually ordered. I ordered a cd and received a book about blessing your children. I hope to find time to return this item very soon, but it's taking longer than I hoped because I'm very busy, which is why I order things online, and it further complicates matters to receive the wrong merchandise."
1,...,This game is terrible. The graphics [are very poor] and the moves are stupid and lame. You only get to choose from 5 different people to be. It also is so easy. I beat it one week on easy and medium and on hard all in one week. So I recommend that you don't buy it because you are just wasting your money.
2,Not original versions,Good songs on this CD but not the original versions. All the songs sound similar as if they were recorded at the same time. Disappointing.
1,Redone - avoid!,"What is it with BJ Thomas redoing all his old songs? There is no need for this CD to even exist, it's all redone and it's not all that great at that. I think the old saying ""quit while you're ahead"" applies here. I do believe these kinds of releases should very plainly state they are NOT original songs, period. A total waste, don't bother with this one unless you want a CD you can use as a coaster."
3,BJ Thomas All-Time Greatest Hits,"A few good classics. A few not-so good dogs.........This collection misses one of BJ's better tunes ""Somebody Done Somembody Wrong."""
4,BJ Thomas hits,"This is a good cd. They aren't ""the"" original first recordings that came out in the late 60's, but BJ still sounds the same and does them the same. It's just some of the backup that is slightly different in some spots....but overall it's a great way to bring back the old memories and I was glad to find this ""near"" original recording, the voice is still the same. I would recommend it as it's hard to find something this close to the original tract....like I said, he sounds right on."
4,Mellow Music w/BJ THOMAS,I always loved the songs he sang years ago & this CD has most of them! Love listening & relaxing!
5,Hip Hop is dead?,"A friend of mine told me that hip hop was dead.I told him that she's not dead, she's just hidingand it's up to us to find her now.Thanks Little Brother. It was great to see her again.-MOLA1"
5,Refreshing Hip Hop,Damn. it is good to see that hip hop is still alive. This is a wonderful CD. The production is on point and lyrics are deep and not the same crap you hear on every radio hit. With 9th Wonder on most of the production...you simply can't go wrong.
3,It's Aaaight,"I get weird vibes from Little Brother... I love the production and Phonte and Poo definitely do their thing - but someway somehow, something doesn't mesh. I can't put my finger on exactly what, but all I know is - I'm feelin' the album one minute and the next I'm like... it's Aaight. I felt the same with the first album. Everyone was all on the debut like that was the best album of the year, but I don't know - it was Aiaght. Needless to say, I copped Chitlin Circuit, and again it's Aaight. I respect their skills and all, but I think I gotta be in the mood for them. It's not that their wack or anything - it's just that certain joints bang hard and others are just... Aaight. Then they kill me when they go ahead and put on a couple of cats with zero rhyme skills. I don't get it. I guess their albums haven't been consistent enough for me. But I did love Foreign Exchange! I was feeling that!"
4,Remix Sounds Better....,"well ....C.C. 1.5 is quite a bit better than ""The Listening""...which is a good cd in its own right...I truly think the remix joints on this one from ""The Listening"" are much doper on the productions side being that the vocals are the SAME...which im not madd at ...I would re-buy this before I re-buy ""The Listening"" which I might not do if I lost the cd...but DEF. ""Chillin Circuits 1.5"" re-play all day....tracks like..""What You Do""..""War""... ""The Yo-YO(remix)""..""Night Time Maneuvers""...yeah...just buy the cd is GREAT!"
1,It's in Chinese,"The ""Outline of Dynastic History"" book is entirely in Chinese. The front and back cover are in English, but the contents are entirely Chinese. This information was not available to me before purchasing."
3,Erratic performance,"The good: This camera is very attractive: compact and sleek. Pretty easy menu system and the most important functions are readily accessible. When conditions are right, it takes clear, beautiful photos. Rechargeable internal battery means you don't spend a fortune in double A's. LCD screen is a good size.The bad: Focus problems!! In certain lighting conditions (e.g. fluorescent lights) you cannot take an in focus picture using the automatic setting. I missed so many potentially great holiday pics of my kids due to fiddling around with the settings. Mostly, I simply gave up trying to get a clear pic. I finally contacted Sony tech support and they acknowledged the focus problems under certain lighting conditions, including bright sunlight. They suggested changing the white balance and shutter speed- but when you're a novice photographer, changing these settings is not so intuitive!Bottom line: Buy a Canon elph. I wish I had. It would have been worth the extra money!"
3,Nice but disappointed with the flash and steady shots...,"This is an okay digital camera, but I was expecting better quality, especially with it being a Sony. I was disappointed with the flash- it does not illuminate as well as my other Sony cybershot (DSC-U20), which was surprising. Some of the pictures also come out more blurry as well- the reason I purchased it was for the zoom and was expecting it to be at least of the quality that I get with my U20 (which does not have a zoom feature). The accessories are nice- I also purchased the waterproof case and it works well with it, but it was almost half the price of the camera itself."
2,Be Forewarned!!,"This is a great little camera, but not worth the buy. I got mine for Christmas last year and within the first 2 months the pin on the command dial had broken. I had to pay to ship it into Sony's repair center and wait 2 weeks for them to fix it. Luckily, it was under warranty. I wasn't so lucky the second time. I went to take a picture with the thing and it blanked out. I thought the battery just needed to be charged, but no such luck. It won't turn on, it won't charge, and the lens is stuck in the on position. It's still under warranty, but Sony wants me to ship it back to their repair center, wait another 2 weeks to fix it, and pay $171 for labor on the thing, even though it's only 6 months old and barely been used. I have a carrying case for it and it is in excellent condition. This thing is not worth the hassles- check out another brand of camera that has a more reliable customer care policy!"
1,It's going back,"One reviewer mentioned that their L1 broke on the 29th picture. I never even got that far - it arrived with a malfunctioning zoom. Also, image quality has been highly erratic (could be the flourescent problem another user mentioned). This is my first digital - I'm an experienced SLR and computer user, but I found the menu to be cumbersome, and the LCD very small. The camera is very ""cute"" and compact, but I'll be looking into either a different Sony or Canon for an exchange."
1,2nd Sony Dsc-l1 Very Upset,"I loved the style, size, functions, and picture results of this camera. Only problem--- it breaks very easily.My first camera the button controler was loose and did not work. Got it replaced shortly after the purchase.Seocnd camera, after a few weeks the lens would not open.I even kept both cameras in a large padded case.I wish the sony dsc-l1 was more durable and reliable- then it would be a perfect camera."
2,Got this as a gift... not too pleased,"I wanted a nice small digital camera just to have to take pictures. My grandma bought me this one. I was pleased with it for awhile, it's small, portable, light and easy to take pictures with that the quality are pretty good, all things considered.Although, only about 5-6 months after receiving it, it broke. It started making this annoying clicking sound and the lens wouldn't emerge, the only thing it did was display pictures...Since it was still under warranty, I sent it in and had it repaired for free. Then it was great...It broke a few months later, the same problem, only this time it wasn't under the one year warranty and it'd cost over a hundred to repair it... and I could just get a different camera with that money...So this isn't the best choice... though maybe I just got a defective camera."
1,poor focus,Sony DSC-H55. I too had focus problems with this camera. ALL images looked soft and all images would lose optical focus (fuzzy edges) before the pixels were visible when zooming in on an image. I called Sony and they could not help. I'm returning the camera --- stay away from this one!
5,Brit's Do it Better,The British Law&Order; is well acted and I enjoy it more than our Americian Law&Order.; The season one was great and I hadto get season two and it keeps getting better.
3,WHEN USA FORMAT,I HAVE THE LAW AND ORDER UK SERIES 1...AND REALLY ENJOYED THE PROGRAMS.WHEN WILL SERIES 2 BE IN USA FORMAT? THIS SERIES AND A FEW OTHERS I HAVE PURCHASED ....BUT CAN'T BUY ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS AS THEY AREN'T USA FORMAT....WHEN DO THEY OR HOW LONG TILL MADE TO PURCHASE IN THE USA.
2,It's just ok,"While I can appreciate the author writing about her desires of love and pain of unrequited love, quite frankly I don't see the appeal of this book. It was very simplistically written, and I could have written something like this myself. It's nothing special. I expected more, and I was disappointed."
4,handy little thing,"I bought this cable to connect the telescope to a portable battery designed for jump starting a car. Obviously, this provides far more telescope tracking time than the little bundle of AA's provided by the designers."
3,It is a common adapter.,I use with my battery and my car.Good for long nights of observation.This summer I think to use it again.
5,Good replacement for Celestron power cable,I lost my original battery adapter for my telescope after a trip. I bough this one and it works well. IIRC the cord on the replacement is longer than the original that came with the telescope. It works well with the Celestron Power Tank.
5,"Works very well, very effective.","I haven't had a problem with it yet. Lots of cordage, no loss of connection, nothing wrong with it and I've had it for several months now."
5,Just the right length!!,"This saved lots of time switching out batteries on a dark hilltop. We had to roll down the window to keep the car lights off. Otherwise, it was great and worked just fine!"
4,Makes life easier in the dark,"I use this to connect my truck backup battery to my telescope. It's nothing fancy, just a way to not waste money on AA batteries. It has plenty of length and appears to be capable of absorbing minor tripping.One word of caution: Place your battery below the telescope so that this cord doesn't become a trip hazard in the dark. Also need to pay attention that you don't wrap the cord around the tripod."
4,This is a must for your telescope,With this charger you don't have to worry about how much time you have left to view the sky. This is well worth it!
3,The Fourth Edition has been published,The definitions are not as complete for some terms as those provided in the MCSE study guides.
2,A bit of a bummer,"I enjoyed the coverage of the Cleveland scene and there is a nice chapter on Suicide, but on balance this book is irritating. Much of it reads like a wrinkly love letter to Patti Smith, Heylin absolutely loathes British punk and the book ends with a ""Postlude"" that is both a bilious screed against any and all other writers on punk and also a frank mash note to Smith. That's hardly writing on ""The Birth Of American Punk Rock,"" as per the subtitle, but rather some kind of personal emotional problem better suited to a therapeutic setting. See p. 331 for Heylin's sad description of Jon Savage's ""England's Dreaming:"" this is just unforgivable. So: find a used copy and pick out the interesting bits, ignore the rest."
3,No Limit Showed Limits,"Just got done watching the No Limit Records DVD, I can say it was ""P"" but answer me this, how can you put out a DVD of rapp videos and all of the profanity is cut out? If I wanted to see the cut versions of the videos I will watch BET.A good DVD for your 16 year old or to be played in a club to not offend anyone."
2,Not for hardcore fans,"Compilation of music videos by Master P, TRU, C-Murder, Mia-X, Silkk the Shocker, and more. Also includes trailors, advertisements for NO LIMIT products (Shoes/Dolls/Clothing), and an interview with the President of NO LIMIT RECORDS, Master P.The videos are clean and edited for language. A PG video that wants to pass itself off as ""Never Before Seen on TV"". The commercials are annoying (while the TWO FOR ONE advertisement for NO LIMIT GEAR is the best). And as far as any in-depth interview? 10 seconds of material between commercials and videos isn't my idea of ""in depth"".The videos are pretty mediocre. Excusing Snoop's ""Woof"", Mia-X's ""Shinin'"" and ""Make 'Em Say UGH!"" The worst video overall would be a battle between Master P's ""B-Ball"" and ""TRU Homies"". Both were pretty rank. Not highly recommendable for fans."
2,make em say ughh,i think that te video Tru homies was way beter wen i really dont like tat son i think that they could show a little more less clothing on te females it attracts the male veiwers and if you made te video less loud and confusing someting like with only two basket ball teams i am a actuall type of veiwers coice and was given the best opinion award.sincerely katie
2,elevator music,I made the mistake of buying this just on the reviews without listening to it. Sounds like bland elevator music. Not one of our favorites but will do when there is nothing else available.
3,"Good baby sleepy-time music, but you can do better","Jason Falkner is a fantastic musician. His first two albums, Author Unknown and Can You Still Feel should convince anyone with ears of that judgment.This is something other. I suppose it succeeds in being good music to lullabye a child to sleep with, but it is certainly not what I would choose for relaxation. Others obviously disagree, but I felt Falkner stripped the feeling out of these until they became Muzak. This album does nothing for me, except perhaps make me long for the original recording, or an interpretation that is not designed to put me to sleep.A mix tape of Enya's slower songs would work as well and be much more engaging.I'm kind of glad this CD is still selling for Jason, but I'll pass. He's great at power pop, but we don't need any more snooze-fests."
2,muzak,"I imagined this would be simple, stripped-down guitar version of the songs. But the album is heavy on strings and synthesizers. It has an elevator music feel to me -- very cheesy. Nothing that I want to hear, or have my kid hooked on. Disappointing."
2,Disappointing -- An Opportunity Missed,"I'm a big Falkner fan and was looking forward to this release. Sadly, it's a minor, disappointing record in an otherwise bright career path for our boy Jason. The arrangements are underwritten, relying heavily on what sounds like a Casio keyboard and drum program, with Jason's guitar overdubbed for effect....I have small four children, and find that this album does not do much to induce sleep (except in me!). It reminds me of the old Bert Kaempfert records, or the Jackie Gleason orchestra. It's just not very interesting musically and certainly not up to the high standards Jason has set for himself. Give it a pass."
1,Gave up on this after 3 tracks,"My girls, who are 5 now, have listend to Robin Speilberg's Beautiful Dreamer since birth (along with some classical selections), which they really like. I was looking for something else to try and thought what better choice than classic Beatles songs set as instrumentals. These are poor renditions of beetles songs. I'm not a musical expert, but it sounds as if the musicians themselves are falling asleep. Any bedtime music for kids should be interesting while relaxing, and this just sounds boring. Makes Beautiful Dreamer sound even better after hearing this. Unfortunately for those trying to find it, it's not currently sold on Amazon."
2,Not what it could be,"I was hoping for a relaxing instrumental CD where we could enjoy our favorite Beatles tunes. It is relaxing, but I can't even recognize the melodies of the songs. If I don't look at the back, I don't know what song is playing. That's not what I wanted out of this CD. If you want a bedtime CD, this is great, but not if you specifically want Beatles tunes."
5,My favorite lullaby cd...,"My husband and I bought this for our son, who was just about a year at the time.We have several lullaby cds, and this is by far our favorite and our son's favorite.He is always asleep by the fourth song, but I stay in his room and listen to it after he falls asleep.It is so soothing and calming, for us as well as for him, and you really can tell that this cd was put together by someone who loves the music.Our copy has a skip during Blackbird, so I am going to buy another copy.Many, many good nights of sleep can be credited to this cd!"
5,Nice music that relaxes my son to sleep!,When I was in college I worked in childcare & we had a version of this album that we played for the 2 yr olds for their nap time. I liked it then because the kids & went right to sleep & I actually liked the music. The same is true now. My son goes right to sleep & my husband & I like the music. Sometimes we sing along to it & the baby really enjoys it. I would definately recommend it to my friends with small children.
5,A wonderful surprise!,"I have always played music for my son to fall asleep, even before he was born. I am not particularly a raving beatles either. However, when my son was in a car accident - he is fine now - I was given this CD and I can honestly tell you that it was sooooo comforting listening to the music for me as well as my son. I think it is the old familiar tunes that give whoever listens to it that warm comforting feeling, that you can't help but release any tension and feel at ease. I still may not be a raving beatles fan, but these classics are so well done, you cant help but doze into a comforting sleep."
5,Great Idea!,"Received this as a gift from a friend I love it. It's a great CD to play while nursing or trying to soothe baby to sleep because it's instrumental (better for baby), yet the songs are familar enough that Mom or Dad can sing along a bit if they want to. A great baby shower gift."
5,Very thought-provoking! Much more than statistics.,"An insightful look into the future of spiritually (not just religion) in America. Facts and figures come alive with meaningful interviews and quotes.The layout of the book with shaded quotes for key ideas make for easy reference.I'm an associate pastor in a large, growing church in the Kansas City area. Many of the people coming to our church fit the descriptions in this book...i.e. they are looking for experiences with living, powerful God.I believe Gallup and Jones have written a book that may impact churches in the same way that Tom Peter's book on excellence impacted the business community years ago."
2,Pan Flute,"Flute was constructed from plastic, not bamboo or natural wood as expected. Sound reflected plastic design instead of wood, so didnt meet my expectation. Vendor accepted return and full refund."
3,More Product Info...,"Just a note - I was expecting the ""Thermal Jar"" to be glass & it is actually plastic. Haven't used the blender yet & am debating sending it back as my last blender had a plastic jar & didn't hold up very well. Will post an update if I decide to keep it."
4,Great bang for the buck!,"My wife and I received this blender as a wedding gift nearly three years ago and have made smoothies with fresh fruit, powder, and ice nearly 200 days of the year, each year, since purchased. I only noticed, today, that It's starting to show signs of it's age and will have to be replaced. It has a couple stress cracks (that do not leak, yet)near the spout and also near the base of the container. I've never had a blender that crushed ice this good. We'll definitely consider buying another if I cannot get a replacement base."
1,Misleading Advertising,"I bought this product because the box says ""no more ice chunks."" There is even an ""icebreaker"" setting. I wanted a way to make slushies. However, the manual says you are to use the ""icy drink"" setting when crushing ice. I am not sure if or when a person is supposed to use the ""icebreaker"" setting!Also, the whole ice crushing process requires many steps and more than a blender. First, you have to pour water in before you can crush the ice. Once you press the ""icy drink"" setting, you pour out the excess water into a collander.Even after all that, there are chunks in the ice. No slushie for me!I gave this product just 1 star because I hate misleading advertising. I will now have to take time out of my crammed schedule to return this product."
3,Not the one you want,"Kenny Burrell has a famous cd called ""All night long"" with Donald Byrd that is an all-time classic. THIS IS NOT THAT CD. This is not even one of the better Kenny Burrell cd's, so I'd say don't buy it unless you can get it for less than $10."
3,swampfire is a horse,"a story about three young teens who are camping in a swamp and they find arunaway horse living there. they are determined to rescue the horse.can they do it? will it all work out in the end?most of the story was good but a couple of scenes were improbable like,the kidsfighting off a bear and then these three helping to contain a wild fire(on their'own-no adults?!?!). other than that,it was enjoyable."
1,Very bad,What was nintendo thinking!? Face it guys nintendo will never make anymore good games....but there is hope!But if you are a kid then why not buy it!!
1,this game sucks big time,this game sucks. it is to easy each level takes like 5 minutes to beat. it is for little kids. the singing at the end of the level sucks. The music is so bad to.
3,it is hard but very stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I cant get to the 3rd level (plus I am nine years old)and yoshi's enemies are weird ; they just walk around and knock yoshi over and yoshi loses a life; and some fly;on story mode there are different enemies;beleve me;story mode is hard.
1,Urgh...,"These are the kinds of games that make make people call the N64 a ""kiddy"" system. This game is pure utter rubbish. Don't buy it. There is a borderline between cute and annoying, and Yoshi's Story steps over it. I cannot stomach this game, it makes me feel like I am gagging on a mixture of honey, maple syrup and molasses. But I suppose since I am 15 I would hate this... If you have very small infants in your household, or you yourself have the mental age of a 3 year old, then mabye you could consider RENTING it."
2,Not very good,First of all this game is really for kids 9 and under. This game isn't very callenging. The bosses are very easy and the game it self is boring. The only thing good about this is the graphics. I would highly reccommend this to younger kids.
2,UM..........,"This game is a good game for young kids, but can also become very annoying very quick. The characters and everything in the game seem to be on Prozac. I can't get over it. The music can also be childish as well. I give you a word of warning to think again when you are prepared to buy it."
5,Yoshi's Story rulz!,"I found this game very fun. The graphics and music are great! The ""sniff"" effect was awesome. As is the way you can switch the text to 3 different languages."
1,This game is awful,"This is the worst game I have ever played. I bought it thinking it would be like most other mario games: challenging and long lasting. I brought this game home, finished it in half an hour, and have hated it ever since. Later, I decided to try to get some more game for my money by trying to find every secret of the game. That took me only another couple of hours. This game isn't worth the money."
3,Bad for kids,"The only Pro of this game is being bad!!!!!!Wait, if it's badI should only give this game 2 stars. Oh well......"
2,regular mario fans beware,i am a kid.i am small.i played this game.it was not so good.ive played better games of go fish.
1,Not that good,This game was not very exiting and the moves are so easy.On a lot of levels there are cracks in the ground that you could fall into but all you have to do is hover right over them. Thisgame is totally for little kids. The bosses are wicked easy. The only good graphic is Yoshi. All the other parts are colored in crayon. (...)
4,"Fun, but way too easy","It was really fun going through the world of Yoshi's, but the game was too easy. I beat it in a few hours. When I buy a video game, I want one that will take weeks to beat, not hours. Still, it was a fun game with cute characters."
4,More Cute than Fun,"The game is based on the fact that the newborn Yoshis are stuck in a storybook because of Bowser. The Yoshis were cute, but a lot of the ideas seemed really lame. For example, the fact that the Yoshis eat fruit for energy (or whatever you want to call it) made it seem like it was meant to tell kids to eat fruit or something. And the fact that they can eat fruit but not peppers....I really didn't get that. It takes a while to finish at first, but after you've played it through once, it doesn't take so long.Anyone who, in other Mario games, really likes to play with Yoshi (like me) would probably like this game."
2,Not the best game...,"This game was REALLY easy. It didn't really seem to have much of a plot either. I think that it is fun to complete the story, but the final boss, Baby Bowser, is pathetically easy. Also, there are a lot of helpful but not needed things, such as white shyguys and extra yoshis. It is easy to beat the game even without them. The only challenge in the game is to get to all of the courses by getting the big hearts. Otherwise, there is no challenge at all in this game. I would probably suggest this for beginner N64 players, but it isn't all that fun."
3,Average,"This game is lacking a lot of things, but it is still a good side scroller. Its definitely reminiscent of Yoshi's Island on SNES. The story leaves much to be desired, as do the characters, but the overall action is fun. I reccomend it for younger audiences, but definitely not for the 11 and up crowd."
3,Old favorite :),"I played this so much when I was younger, I'm only 18 now, but I saw it on here and HAD to buy it. I basically went through the levels so fast, and kind of got bored, the game wasn't as interesting as I used to think it was. One thing is that I try going through it so fast that I end up falling in one place and get so frusterated I give up, but over all.. great game for kids or people who are easily entertained. I still play on occasion."
2,I couldn't find any point to this game.,"Maybe it's just me, but I had a difficult time understanding this game. I always like a game with a goal, and this one doesn't seem to have one. I also couldn't figure out any strategy. Maybe I'm trying to put too much into it, and need to just relax and enjoy what's there."
1,Yoshi's Abomination,"This game is a cakewalk. There are. big problems with this game, and they are:1. Price; I know this is an old game and very rare nowadays, but 600 dollars is a lot for this piece of $&@!2. Difficulty This game is about as hard as typing. Ridiculously easy3.Length A fast gamer can beat this in barely an hour. If you want this game, download it on the Wii Virtual Console for $10.63. That's what I did......."
3,Great Service,"Excellent service. I received the product right within the time frame estimated.As for the game itself: the storyline is a little childish for my tastes, but the game-play itself was great. I grew up with the platform games featuring Mario and Yoshi; and this game reminded me of how much fun they were to play."
3,The Story Unfolds.,"This game wasn't the best game I've ever played. It was a change though since Mario wasn't the star of this game (Mario's Story? O_o Okay I'll shut up). Since Yoshi was the main character, I thought it would be adorable when I saw it ... When I brought it home to play, I sat there for hours playing it. I thought the little Yoshi characters were just plain adorable. Then my brother played it. He was around 4 or 5 at the time. He absolutely loved it. I wasn't too impressed by it. But, I guess this is a great game for the younger generations. If you have a younger brother/sister/son/daughter/etc., get this game for them. They'll have a blast."
4,Cute relaxing game,"I enjoy this game. It's very cute, nice graphics , easy to learn and I found the music to be relaxing kind of like some of the Zelda music. It's a great game for little kids or anyone who just wants to zone out and relax. My only problem is that it's very short and ther isn't a whole lot to do."
3,"Easy, easy, easy.","Yoshi's story is great fun, but it's so easy that you can probably beat it in about 5 days. It's about Yoshis(cute little dinosaurs).The Yoshis love their great fruit tree. Then, baby Bowser coms and takes it away. It's all up to the Yoshis to get it back. If you are older than five i suggest you not to get this game."
5,Fun for me.,I was happy that a Yoshi game came out so I bought it. Most people don't like the music or gameplay but I do. I think it was kind of neat for the to make the enviorment look like cardboard. It's also nice that you can choose what color Yoshi you want. That's my opinion.
2,I wasted $11.50,One of my best friends told me that this was a great game so when I saw it I bought it. I was thinking $11.50 has to be a great investment for a game this great! Boy was I wrong. I found myself bored of the game within two days. Yoshi eats fruit and then gets happy. That is about the plot of the story. The fruit is kind of like the rings in Sonic but you have to eat a certain amount of fruit to beat the level. Why can't I just beat up some bad guy to win? Eating fruit to win? Not my idea of fun. Sure it's original but besides that? Pointless. Overall this game is a major bore and yes I am a nintendo fan. Even a Yoshi fan. Garh.
2,"Yohi's Story - Great for beginners, but a little too kiddish","This is what I think of the game...Difficulty EASY! You can learn to use the controller in a minute!I heard that the enemies are easy.Graphics 4/5- Have to admit, has good graphics!Design & background 1/5- Happy Enemies, Basic Background, This is what makes the game for 5 year olds and under. However, if you are new to video gaming, it may not be that bad.Controller 2/5- You can't really use the digital pad. You can only use the ANNOYING analog stick.Overall, it is sort of a kiddish game, but if you are new to the N64 or video gaming and you don't know what game to get, then you can get this game, but this is more for a 5-year-old gamer.I gave this game 2 stars because of the graphics.Before you buy it, rent it. You will be glad you did."
3,A guilty pleasure on the N64,"OK this game is easier than just about any game out there, but I love the cute animation and the little Yoshi songs and eating weird exotic fruits. Perhaps the game would have been better if each little Yoshi had a diffrent ability. YOu can find the ""secret"" black and white Yoshis but they play the same as the rest of the Yoshis. The is far, Far, FAR from being a great game, but if I have nothing better to do I may just play this fun little turn off your brain game and soak up this little 1998 N64 baby jump and stump!"
5,Me and Caleb,"This book was read to my 6th grade class in Beaumont, TX years ago. I have searched for it for several years. It is a wonderful story, as I recall everyone in class loved the book, boys and girls. We laughed and cried and pondered over our own lives, but most of all it showed us that reading could be very fun!!"
5,Great Book,"My 4th grade teacher read this book to our class, way back in the 70's. I will always remember this story, and hope to find this book someday to read to my childern. If you can get a hold of it, keep it and pass it to your children. They will LOVE it!"
3,Good but not as good as Captain Corelli's Mandolin,"I bought this book since the blurb promised it would be as good as Captain Corelli - Wrong! I found the characters very distant and I could not get involved in their stories. On the other hand, this book is beautifully written and the depiction of ancient battles, and the way the author relates them to the modern day story of Captain Carlo, is very good indeed. The scene at the beginning of the book as Carlo relates a battle tale to Count Ciano (Mussolini's foreign minister) and to his future wife is truly ace. This is a book for an intelligent reader and I am sure there are many Amazon readers who consider themselves to be that!"
3,Colorful But Hindered By Ponderous Gameplay.,"I always liked the Duck Dogers cartoons, few though they were, they had a unique comedy - not to mention art - style all their own. In Duck Dogers, Infogames tries to capture the cartoon as much as possible and for the most part has suceeded in doing that.Duck Dogers is one of the best cartoon to videogame translations since Tarzan.Unfortuntely, while Infogames were so caught up in making the game look and feel like the cartoon, they forgot about the underlying game. The gameplay itself is simple and very one-dimensional, with bland, colorful textures throughout.Duck Dogers is mildly fun at best. It will appeal to younger gamers that aren't expecting Banjo and Kazooie with Daffy Duck in it, but most regular gamers won't rent it a second time.- Louis"
5,Not far from Mario 64!,"This game is loads of FUN! Daffy's big mouth may be annoying on T.V, but it really adds to the fun in this game. He makes more speech in this game than Mario ever did in his first 64 game. Mario sounded good, but Daffy speaks more(and better) English. Daffy may not have as many moves as Mario, but that doesn't mean much. The graphics in DD are put out very well but sometimes the game moves kinda choppy at times so you don't see the real beauty of the game, but there is so much to do and explore you won't care too much. The levels are large and fun to play. And the spaceship is beautiful inside and nice to look around. The game is fairly challenging and will take time to master if your an average gamer, if your a hardcore gamer it may be a breeze! Overall this game is awesome. Not as good as mario but not far from it, and will keep your interest for a long time, unless it's too easy for you!"
3,A little disappointed...,"My 8-month old standard schnauzer is an avid chewer. A destroys a regular Kong in a weekend sort of chewer. I've been desperately searching for something that can last a little while with her. This isn't it.The Bear-Dog makes a fun noise and she absolutely loved it. However, while being actively supervised it only took half an hour for the squeaker to be broken and less than a day to get the head off.If you have a normal dog who chews an average amount, it's a grand toy and your dog will love it. If you have a determined beast with jaws of steel, this is not your toy."
3,"Why You Do Me Like That, JW Pet?","They just don't make 'em like they used to! I purchased my first Ruffians Bear toy about 3-4 years ago, and what's left of him is still enjoyed by my dog. But I decided it was time for a new one. I like JW's toys because they are durable, they've got great squeakers, and, hey, they smell like vanilla. This latest bear I've had for going on 3 weeks, and it lost its squeak at least a week ago. My previous Ruffians Bear (also in red) lasted for at least a year--driving everyone nuts who came to my house (it was awesome). But now when my dog goes to squeak his new bear, nothing comes out :(. I'm the annoying person at the pet supply place that squeaks all the toys like 5 times to find the loudest one, so I was pretty disappointed by this toy, too. My dog still plays with it, though, and it makes a decent chew toy, so I've rated it 3 (""it's okay""). Seems fair."
3,Cute but doesn't last with a heavy chewer,My parents dog can destroy any toy in under 30 minutes. I have bought every toy saying it is for tough chewers. What a laugh. This one still actually has its head so that is pretty good considering I thought he would destroy it in under 2 minutes. My dog who is smaller and not much of a chewer ignores this toy. Maybe if I had bought the smaller size he would like it.
4,Another great Royal Diary book!,"Anna Kirwan, tried very hard to complete this book and i found it another moving and wonderful addition to this great series!Victoria is in a time where there is no freedom for her and her people.Her mother is under the power of a roudy captain, and she is constantly being bossed around by her daughter!Victoria tries to comfort herself by luxurious and exotic holidays, but her life is a mess, especially when she spots her mother being severely abused by the evil captain.Victoria is an emotional novel, that will make you feel lucky and happy about your life.At least Victoria knows one thing!She's heir to the English thrown!Read this challenging diary to experience a snapshot of her wonderful life!Anna Kirwan has done a great job on the production of this book!"
4,There are some better diaries,I did like this book a lot but you have to admit that there are better diaries. Princess Victoria expresses herself in a very unique way by saying being a princess is not the best thing out there. This book is telling every girl that wants to be a princess that well they should think about it a little more. Overall this book was a good one.
2,NO WAY!!,"this book was insanely boring i had to read it for a book report. I love to read but i don't know a child who could understand the vocabulary used. Im not saying it wasn't interesting but i simply could NOT find the plot line i needed for my report! It had a beginning, middle, and end ( as all books do) but the not the things my teacher requires, like the climax, this story fell flat for me."
4,Victoria - May Blossom Of Brittania Bravo!,"What a wonderful new addition to the Royal Diaries Series!Victoria princess of Brittain wrote a diary at 9 years of age.This book is about a young princess growing up in an era of hardship.With her mother being controlled by nasty Captain Conroy Victoria lived angrily through her days.But one day Victoria finally realised that she has the right to be liberated too.Even though some parts in this book are slow and dull,the book becomes interesting and more interesting day by day.This book is definitely one of the best because of it 's easiness to go along with the characters and the clear way the scene of the story is depicted.This book is very interesting and also has a lovely front cover.It's Fab!"
2,Victoria,"I really did not like this book much. Compared to all of the other Royal Diary books, this one was quite boring. I really enjoy learning about parts of history in these types of books, but in this one I did not learn that much. Queen Victoria was the longest reigning queen in England and this book was not all that interesting. I think it was too packed with what Victoria was feeling about the man who was taking control of her life, instead of what was going on around her life. I suggest reading this, but i also suggest that if you had a pick between this book and another. Choose the other."
2,A dull princess,Victoria's diary is dull and boring book. Anna Kirwan's future queen of Wales is whiny and sounds like she is 70. This book is about studies and The catain an advier to the mother.Anna Kirwan's other book Flower of Baccle is also a flop.
2,IT WAS FABULOUS! not.,"This is a very odd book that rambles on about playing with dolls, watercolors, gypsy fortune tellers, and old guys that make corny speeches. I adore this series but come on! Who wants to read a book about a doll-playing 9 year old? It was BORING! God save us. Otherwise it was fabulous!Ok, maybe that was a little harsh, now I feel guilty because I know Anna Kirwan worked very hard to make this book. It's impossible for a book to have nothing worth reading in it and this was no acception. The story IS dry and dull and it DOES ramble on about playing with dolls, but a true fan of this series needs to stick it out and I did. It could have been great if the plot was made a little more clear and if the charecters were more developed. Read it because it's your duty as a true fan but not for a good read."
4,pretty good book,"i love to read fictional accounts of royalty. it is so much moreentertaining and makes them seem more down to earth. most nonfictional books just give the plain facts with no recourse ontheir private lives. one thing that i did not like was the authormade a huge mistake by saying that princess victoria's father wasa king of england and that he died when she was a baby. now as anonly child of his, that would make her queen and not a princess.these kinds of errors should have been caught by the publisher.i love history and let's keep some of the facts straight in thebooks."
2,Not Royalty- Worthy,"This book shows that even princessess are human!!! Most of the time the book is highly dull, and rather disapointing. You would expect the book to more fast paced. But describing your meal (today we had...)???rather sad, i would think. Not much of a plot, either."
3,Dull,This book was boring to be honest . This kept me getting off track and was hard to pay attention .
2,yuck!,"I was dissapointed with this book. You'd think that such an important women in histiry would have a fasinating dairy. But no! All you'll learn in this book is the troubles of a nine year old who's idea of fun is playing with dolls. I forced myself to finish it, hoping towards the end it would get better. it didn't. Now I know most people don't listen to the negative reviews but listen to my warning. Don't buy this book. Think about it, if your a royal diaires fan (like me) and you by the entire series (like me) you'll spend $$$$. It's well worth it for every book except this one. Don't waste your money, use it for the other FABULOUS books in this awesome series."
5,Richard at his finest,"You have to buy this one, even if it's only for the cover picture of Richard, circa 1970 (aka Richard Cobain). Dark and kooky - let's hope we get more of these longer works from Papa Peabody."
4,Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire,"On a whole I really enjoyed playing the game. The graphics where pretty goo, but where to me no better or worse than any other N64 game considering the technology available at the time. The difficulty and save features were a bit irritating at times, but I am one who likes a challenge. I feels a whole lot better when you finish a game that most critics deem to be very difficult. It shows that you have the skill it takes to overcome the obstacles put forth by the creators. I have also read the book and the game is a good representation of it. On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 7.5. Thanks for taking the time to read my comments. Thanks. Atiba Tucker"
2,Shadows of the Empire Review,"The game has it's good parts, including the amazing first level and the cool bosses (Boba Fett and AT-STs), but some levels become long and repetitive, giving it a low replay value. Overall, it is an average game, with a little bit of everything in it. You can swim, fly, shoot, and pilot spaceships all in one game. But still, if you are a hard-core Star Wars fan, you will probably be disappointed with this failed attemt at a fun game."
2,What the!,"The flying levels are great and the Mos Eisley speeder bike level rocks, but overall the control and graphics are bad. The afore mentioned levels have good graphics and the different weapons are cool, but still the weak controls, awful cut scenes and un-involving story line make this have little replay value. But some of those flying levels are great but as a shooter its dull. Get Rogue Squadron for the flying, Pod Racer for the speederbike stuff and Dark Forces 2 for a great shooter."
4,A Game That is a Lot of Fun with Cool Cheats,"This game was the very first N64 game I've ever played. You're Dash Render a Han Solo like character. This game is a lot of fun, accurate to the book, and has the best debugger cheat I've ever seen. There is a three ship levels where you're in the Outrider(Dash's Ship) or a snow speeder. There is four camera modes so you can play it either James Bond first person style or Laura Croft Second person style either way it's fun. Your choices of weapons are aewsome, from laser, to seeker(a heat seeking gun), to disrupter(half grenade, half atom bomb this bay will fry everything including Dash). A great game that doesn't waste your money."
3,good game but no Multi - player Mode,StarWars shadowsoftheEmpire is agoodgame and is very ongoing at some points but there is no Multi-playermode and the game is hard even in easy.The first threeLevels if you choose Easy are simple but it gets Little hard on LeveL4 and really hard at the end ofit the bosse is very hard but if you know the two items you need to beat him you won't have a problem or if you beat him by chance the games allows you to choose a diffculty LeveL and a name for your file.Although you can't swicth characters or use a lightsaber you get to pilot a snowspeeder and a ship called theoutrider which looks likes the millenumFalcon. you go to places like Hoth Tatoonie and other places Like ordMantell and GaLLspaceport. other than no Multi-playermode or characterswich this game is fun and might enjoy you.
4,Very Good,"This game is the best Star Wars game ever! The graphics are wonderful. Controlling is easier than heck, and you can have several views of your player in missions. Only one bad point- there is absolutely NO multiplayer. But everything else in this game makes up for it. It only costs 40 bucks, so buy it before N64 is gone!"
4,A favorite N64 game of mine...,"I got this game about a week after i got my nintendo 64 and Super Mario 64. I was 12 years old and i was obsessed with Star Wars. I was so excited to have a star wars game in 3D and on Nintendo!The game is tough! The control isnt really that great, but back then i didnt care, i wanted to get through the game and find all the secrets. i wanted to explore the world of star wars through this game.The graphics are not all that great, but they work. For being a launch title, it wasnt that bad. But going back and playing it now, i cant help to notice the flaws.The music really draws you into the game. Its not suprising with a star wars product though.I wasnt a fan of Dash Rendar or whatever his name was. I wanted to use a lightsaber in this game.The boss battles in this game are insanely tough! I couldnt get passed Bobba Fett for weeks. I havent even played it on the hardest difficulty.This is a great game, and it shouldnt be bashed as much as it is."
4,awesome game,I thought this was one of the best games ever. It is so awesome. Whatever U do B-U-Y I-T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Milwaukee 49-56-2253 Hole Saw,"Very good hole saw, cuts quickly through cement board. No tmuch momre can be said it is a hole saw and works well."

4,Chicana mothers,"This book is written by Alma Luz Villanueva and she has been a mother for most of her life. Chicana's face more than just American stereotypes of who they are as women. They face codices within the culture as well. This book illustrates the types of roles Chicana women fit into at this time. Mothers, grandmothers, and innocent girls. Each female has a role to play and each role is saturated in tradition.Villanueva paints a glorious picture of how it is to live inside the Mexican American culture behind closed doors. I recommend this book to all women everywhere.V-"
1,Waste (or waist) of time,My title says it all. There were so many spelling mistakes and/or typos (including the one above in the bio of Tie Domi) that I gave up half way through the book. If the author and/or the publisher couldn't bother to produce a quality book I couldn't be bothered finishing it.
1,This book is BEYOND brutal!,"This is what happens when a radio reporter tries to write. Never have I read a more boring book in my life. Here's some typical portions from the book: ""I got up. I ate breakfast and read the newspaper. There was a story about so-and-so. Then I went to the rink for practice. I talked to so-and-so about the game that night. Then I went back to the hotel. I was bored, so I went to a movie. When the movie was over, I went back to my room, grabbed my things and went to the rink."" It goes on and on like that. Really, folks, give this subject to someone who can actually WRITE and tells you about all the drinking and #$%@?! that goes with hockey people when they travel AND THEN you will have a book! I covered the NHL for a long time. I know of what I speak."
1,::yawn::,"What a huge disappointment this book was. Berger has such an interesting topic to start off from (travelling with the Leafs) but he ends up babbling about senseless details. Berger subscribes to the idea that he doesn't want to write a kiss-and-tell expose' on the inner workings of a team. Thats fine, but instead we end up with him droning on about how the flight into LAX comes in from the Pacific ocean, and then you can see the coast, and then the smog, and then more lights. And then it was a bumpy landing.And then I put the book down.There's plenty of other good books which actually relate good hockey anectdotes without getting into the players' personal lives. Dick Irvin does a masterful job of telling his stories and Tod Hartje's book is a great inside look at hockey in Russia. Those books have a great flow and excitement to them just like a game. Berger's book is like sitting in the penalty box all night long."
4,"Fascinating, unique book.","Howard Berger wrote a fascinating book here. He's combined hockey with life on the road. Those looking for pure hockey (Dick Irvin books, etc.) might feel disappointed, but they're missing Berger's aim here. Life on the road is indeed drab at times, and more than anything, Berger conveys more humanity than most sports books I've read. I enjoyed it immensely. My biggest criticism is the book would've benefitted from a proofreader."
1,Simply put: The worst hockey book ever written,"How this book got written is BEYOND ME. It was boring. It was written by a radio guy. It gets into the monotonous details of NOTHING. You wanna go on the road with a hockey team? Who cares what the author saw at the movies between the morning skate and game time! What we want to know is what go-go bars they were in and why! We want people. We want dirt. Yeah, that's what happens on the road in pro sports...but he didn't have the guts to break the old credo of ""What happens on the road stays on the road."" Think of this as a black-lined secret government document for sports."
5,Must have,"My wife and I have been playing this CD to our daughter for the past four months straight. We have a baby monitor, and this means I hear the album as often as my daughter does, which is roughly 20 times a night. I have yet to tire of the album. Falkner is someone with great talents--he plays every instrument--and, more importantly, he has a serious, serious apprecation for the Beatles. His liner notes say that he recorded the album out of respect for the Beatles, and this is immediately evident in his treatment of the songs. This album is so good you wouldn't know it was meant for babies if no one told you. Highly recommended."
4,"Great performance, great songs","Marion Williams was one of Clara Ward's singers. She was very good and this CD shows it. It has great versions of ol'time favorites like ""How I got over"", ""Precious Lord"", ""Stand by me"" (the second best version I've heard, after Mavis Staples'), ""In the upper room"" (if you're used to Mahalia's version, get ready: this one's got rythm)."
2,A little to Complicated for me.I wanted something less stressful.,I'm sure there are many people who would love this game. But i was looking for something not so violent.
4,crunchy deathmetal + grindcore,"Grume is a mix between catchy deathmetal riffing and pure grindcore. The oeverall mix is quite innovative though, the artwork is great and Haemorrhage are quite a humourous bunch of freaks. a must buy"
3,WAY TO SHORT,10 levels of easyness. the only hard level i thought was the robot fac. that one took me awhile. lets review. graphics: 4controlls: 4.5 story line:3 funfactor: 4.5 overall: 4 this game is fun but way to short
5,Goldeneye 2,pros. the storymode is very entertaining. arcade mode rocks. characters like a monkey and the gingerbreadman are avilybel. fun minigames like pong and snake can be unlocked. best multiplayer game for gamecubecons. the mapmaker is to boring. not enough weapons
5,I Am Amazed,I saw this game and it looked real good but I still couldn't decide if I should get it. Well I had an extra [$$] and I bought it. Now I am ticked I didn't buy it before. It really lives upto it's name on being like Goldeneye. But it is actually so much more better then Goldeneye. I would give the game a perfect 9.9. Don't wait get this game it is the best first person shooter. It is even more fun then Halo.
3,Awesome Multi-Player; Mediocre Single Player Game,"First of all, if you're expecting an immersive single player game like Goldeneye, forget it. It's just not here. The single player game is fun if you take each level seperately, but it doesn't make much sense when taken as a whole. That's unfortunate, as TS2 has a lot going for it otherwise. Great graphics, a wealth of multiplayer options and the effective use of bots give this game replay value. The single player game does not."
5,I'm lovin' this!,"FINALLY!!! YES, a great First-Person-Shooter for the Gamecube! Those of you who love Max Payne, Halo and especially GoldenEye will love this game. To the video game world, IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!"
1,Dont buy!!!!,These speakets are a waste of money! Ok 1st of all just takeing the thing outa the box it was already falling apart n the sidings for the soundholes was coming off. And I onlybumped them for lk 10 mins with my 500 watt xpload amp until they stopedworking and alot of smoke started coming from them!! They look nice but are rele not worth it.. I will never buy another product by pyle ever ever EVERRRR again!
4,bass box,"If your looking for deep bass this is the box for you. The dual 12"" speakers sound great with no background noise(rattle),highs sound great also.The plexy front is a nice touch. I like the overall design and affordability and would recommend this to anyone looking to enhance their system."
1,NEVER RECEIVED,"I ordered this item, but never received it. So why would i be expected to 'review' it?"
1,lame not worth it,"blends 3 mortal kombats in one, not the first three games that i expected. game play was lame. Not for beginners very hard."
1,It SUCKS,"This game is way too hard and the button settings are awkward and the characters that you fight, even on very easy, block almost all of your moves. Even if you are doing well the computer starts walking away from you and only does sweeps on you and you wont be able to block it for long because your opponent can still grab you even though you are still blocking. It is not an opinion when I say this game sucks. This game would be a waste of money and time. I know because I bought one off ebay and I waited almost a week (very excitedly however) and I couldn't wait to get it into the system and after playing it for an hour I feel like ripping the game apart and throwing it in an incinerator, scoop out it's ashes and run it over repeatedly with a monster truck. Over all unless you want to fell incredibly angered than never buy the game."
4,There is only one reason to buy this game,"That reason is if you need it to complete your collection. Get MK 4, it is much better. MK: Trilogy is too slow, mind-numbing slow, and, did I mention this?, slow. A huge selection of fighters, but who cares? The game is too slow to play. Each characters has about four frames of animation. Yuck, get MK 4."
2,Trilogy??? Wheres the rest of them??? This is more like MK3!,"This version of the trilogy absolutly stunk to high heaven. What the hell happend??? I first brought the MK Trilogy on PC. But after I upgraded to Windows 98 the game would not install anymore, it only worked on Win 95. So I saw the playstaion version, but I never liked the PS and I saw that it was exactly the same as the PC version.. so I figured the N64 version would be just the same.... wrong!!!! There is about 20 charactors missing from the 64 version for some unknown reason. They could well have included them but for some reason this game is more like Mortal Kombat 3 with a few extra charactors.I hope the PC version gets re-released some day. Or maybe i'll just get a PS version Rom, because MK trilogy is the best MK game ever... just not on the 64."
3,not as good as 4,"same as the other one but with a few glaring differences like the graphics stink like a butt on this one.theres a lot of characters in this one.theres robots,cops,martial artists,gods.......really theres only 2 types.1-the kind that get beat down by the computer almost every time and 2-the kind you can win with all the time prettily easily through massive repition.they are lou kang,raiden and the cop.theres some male ballerina looking dude with a lot of flaming balls.......errr i mean fire balls.hes pretty good except for the whole spandex thing.its alright but 4 is way way better.im actualy suprised theyre even from the same system considering 3 looks like a sega master system game.for all you bozos out there the sega master system came out after the intellivision and before the original nintendo.oh yeah,i dont appreciate the guys who made this making shiva a chick when in fact shiva is a very powerful hindu god with enough destructive capacity in his 3rd eye to destroy existence!"
4,Mortal Kombat Trilogy,"Bloody and brutal.What else would you expect from an MK game?It's always fun to play this classic and compare it to current MK games.Obviously the graphics are much worse, but I find the gameplay to be just as fun."
5,I love this game,I love this game. I play it with my friends and family members whenever we get bored. It's like a blast from the past.
4,nothing can prepare you...,"MORTAL KOMBAT!!! this is the last 2D MK game, and it is freakin' awesome! this game provides intense fast paced action, wicked combos, and awesome fatalities. plus nothing says ""in your face"" like kicking your friends rear end in mortal kombat, this is a must have for anyone into the N64 games."
2,little effort,"it is interesting - but....it would appear little effort has been put in to make this a must-get DVD. The video is as per original ie not digitally enhanced and the audio is AC3-2 channel. Having put up with that - you have to then accept that there is no 'play all' option for the videos. After each vidoe finishes, you are directed back to the menu screen to choose the next video. This is all far too manual and very annoying. Surely a little bit more effort could be put into this DVD to make it worthwhile."
2,DO NOT BUY SCEPTRE PRODUCTS ANY MORE,"I bought Sceptre product and the quality was not I expected. I contacted their tech support, the customer service was not friendly and not professional."
3,Lean on Me,"This book is most useful for the newly diagnosed. It had some good advice for those who have been living with MS for a long time (for instance the medical card people with MS should carry), but I found a lot of what Ms. Davis advocating not realistic for those of us severely affected by the disease; i.e. in a wheelchair, unable to drive, very dependent on others for most activities. I could go along with her until I got to the part of the book where she doesn't take any of the approved MS medications...I then surmised that she and I do not suffer from the same brand of MS. Positive thinking is important in dealing with any form of this nasty disease, but sometimes it is just not enough."
2,Simple,"This a good book for those who have yet to venture in the zoo of the personal medical investigation. However, for those hoping for more specific help in the MS specifics of identification MS, solutions, and who to see it --this book does fall short."
2,My Fair Viking,"I normally love anything Sandra Hill writes, but this time I was so disappointed. Usually she writes ""laugh out loud"" humour and steamy love stories. This just didn't get it. Hopefully her next book will be up to her usual standards."
3,Slick,"This is a slick little recording that sanitizes the tops of the pops of roots music - sort of a roots muzak experience. It's a pleasurable enough listen, and Bobby Horton is a wonder as a solo string player who overdubs up to 7 instruments on a much too up-tempo version of ""Hard Times,"" but it's all just too, too clean. Good background music, though."
5,love the '''horsepower''',"got 5 more ''horsepower'' it looks awsome on my 2001 t/a ws6...people/ nothis right a way, eye catcher.... got 2 more alwards...thazs ''amazon.com....... joe chknhwk russo......"
1,lacking,"I found this book totally boring. It is a pathetic representation of both shamanism and Tibetan Buddhism and poorly written to boot. The text is shallow, contrived and predictable and the platitudes given by the author are simplistic and trite. Readers would be far better served by picking up something approaching an authentic experience. Kalu Rinpoche's Gently Whispered would be a good start on the Tibetan side and almost anything by Carlos Casteneda would more accurately allude toward the shamanic experience. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Lose the Heafy and give me more meat...,"I'm thoroughly unimpressed with this album. I own two Trivium albums, so once I heard Matt Heafy was the vocalist, I had to go check them out. That being said, I've recently gotten out of metalcore. Heafy doesn't have a good death metal voice. It is too raspy and high-pitched for my taste.The second thing I don't understand is the complete lack of double bass drumming and down-tuning. It doesn't sound death metal at all. It sounds like exactly what Trivium is (thrash core) with some interesting tech and prog elements thrown in so they can mention Death in their influences section.This band has a good guitarist for tech-riffage, but not much else. I can't highly recommend this mediocre album at this point, but don't take my word for it. Fractured gets 3.1/5 stars."
2,Made in China,"When plate arrived I thought beautiful! Washed it,put it away. Was cleaning up my basement where box was and noticed...MADE IN CHINA. No where in description did it state that. All the Portmeirion I have is made in England. Learned a lesson don't buy anything outside of Amazon!!! Had to ship it back to company at my expense, 58.00 dollars later!!!"
1,Lots of gore... doesn't save the movie,"Let me start out by saying that I love horror movies, and esp. low budget ones. But this is something else... It's 104 mins. too long. The plot is horrible, the acting is even worse, the filming dreadful. The only thing decent in this is some interesting shots of the moon, and the graveyard. Also, the blonde girl in this, Darya Zabinski, is an absolute knock-out. Some of the reviewers on here are on drugs. Her getting naked was the only good thing in this movie. And usually that's the worst thing about a horror movie. And yes, the gore... tons of it... but believe me it in no way saves this movie. I found myself looking at the clock hoping it would be over soon. Avoid it like the plague..."
1,Very Disappointing,"when I first came across Bone Sickness, I was new to unearthed films. I had only seen Aftermath and Nails, probably a few others. I thought to myself ""Wow, this production company knows what its doing! Nothing they produce could be horrible."" So, I gave Bone Sickness a shot, and this movie completely proved my opinion on unearthed films wrong. The gore is medicre at best and the plot is horrible, the acting... just everything. I found this movie to be unwatchable and I am very open minded about low-budget, independt movies. But no. Don't waste your time. It isnt even campy its just bad. I feel the same about City f Rott. Animated gore? Hell, they could take that so far! but they don't. its the same zombie being killed for 2 hours and its boring. How the hell do you mess up a cartoon about zombies? The art looks good but it isnt AMAZING. Both of these movies should be lifted from unearthed because its a shame they are produced by the same company that produced Aftermath. Sheesh."
1,dont waist your money,"1st thing 1st, this is low budget..... very, very low.the acting = not good.the soundtrack = not good. the special effex = not good.On the dvd box it claims to be 'on par with any of Fulci's zombie films... this has nothing to do with italian movies of the 70's.It takes 40 minutes before we even see a zombie and to be honnest they dont look good.This movie is a bunch of friends with a camera with nothing else to do.The only thing i liked is the blonde girl when she took of her shirt.It says it on the box : we dare you to watch the whole movie.... your right, i didint !!"
5,my 2nd favorite magazine,"Love this magazine, and the great price...that's all that's necessary to say, but forced to continue, so here goes...all done"
4,A bit disappointing,"For fans of the series, you will disappointed to see little of Betsy or the shop. This is really about a completely new family and the murder of the matriarch.While the plot is good, we all read cozy mysteries for the series as much as the plot, so that was the disappointment.We start with the murder of Edyth Hanraty, who left a strange will. Edyth's niece, Jan, one of Betsy's customers, is one of the suspects and so wants to figure out who did it. The story leads to a complex web of Edyth's past that involves the entire family to explain Edyth in the quest to find her murderer."
1,No ending,"Bought this anticipating another ""goodie"" only to get to page 282, and have it abruptly end with no resolution of the murder, and the victim of attempted murder still in a coma and no resolution on that one, either. What gives??????????"
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. It was such a letdown especially since the book before was so good. This book rambles on about things that don't have anything to do with the plot. I missed the main characters. We have missed the birth of Jill's baby who is now 6 months old! Jill who all along was going to be a desk sargent; now has quit her job without warning. Where is Betsy's love interest? He just isn't mentioned again. While I am disappointed in this book, I will read the next one in hopes that Ms. Ferris will resume the blending of the plots and characters in a way that I have come to admire and enjoy."
3,knits and fits,"There the close knit group of characters usually found in the other books. Outsiders purloin the plot and twist it their way. Has anyone tried the knitting pattern at the end? There seem to be some mistakes in it. The description of the moss stitch, leads to ribbing and not the normal moss stitch."
2,For a story based on geneology....,"So, if Susan and Stewart are brother and sister, how does Susan's daughter become Stewart's daughter's aunt? And whatever happened to the dog? One sentence-- they took the dog to the pound, the housekeeper adopted the dog, the dog moved in with a neighbor. What happened to the dog? These two big questions kept pulling me out of the story."
2,Where's Betsy?,"I have enjoyed this series of books and eagerly look forward to each new installment. But, I was a little disappointed with this new book. The story line took us away from the craft shop and into the life of one of Betsy's customers and her family. Betsy makes an appearance here and there, but the charm of the yarn store and her employee Godwin and the rest of the gang was missing. I also thought that the murder was too grisley and graphic for a ""cozy"" mystery book. I really appreciate it when a author can make a story interesting and pull me in, without the violence and gore that some mystery writer's resort to. But, I will continue to await the next book with anticipation and hope that the plot will return back to it's original format."
1,Who wrote this book?,"I've read all the books in this series and couldn't wait for this one to come out. However, I was very disappointed. Many in the main cast of characters were hardly mentioned-No Jill, No Monday Bunch, No Sophie. Betsy and Godwin are certainly not main characters in this book and they seem very flat. This book is missing all of the elements that made the earlier books in the series enjoyable. Did someone else write this book?"
5,The one essential green wood working book,I have read and used this book to produce my own chairs. It is excellent in every respect!
3,something to think about,"I have not read this book but I just recently began going to Alanon and am glad I stumbled upon this. It makes me realize that I need to always be aware of the people around me. That just because they are in Alanon does not mean they are good people. So far the people Ive met seem very good natured but I will stay alert for warning signs and not get too close. I will take what helps me and leave what does not. If anyone ever makes me uncomfortable then I will stay away from them. I will trust my instincts while attending Alanon. Really any where you go in this world no matter how ""good and pure"" the people and program may seem there is always going to be bad mixed in. That is why I like that the twelve step programs say to take what you can use and leave the rest. I will not stop attending Alanon because of this book, but I will be more aware."
2,Where the Criticism Matches the Criticized,"...in silliness!Mr. Goodner probably has some good points to make -- I doubt anything Oprah pushes is really good -- but to spend, what, five pages going on about Plato's Cave allegory is pedantic in the extreme: we get the point, let's move on....Now, I said that the author ""probably"" has some good points in his book because I haven't read it -- just browsing the few scanned pages turned me off (the two-star rating reflects those few pages scanned in). I'm no codependency cult fan; I just wanted to hear this side of the matter, but the style of writing was so pedantic and smug as to have made me think that reading this would be a real bore, too!Hopefully the tone of the writing will be amended -- and the pedanticism excised -- in a future edition. Again, there are probably good points here against codependent psycho-babble (I myself don't know enough either way right now)...just wish they were made more intelligently and, even, more humanely."

3,A Missed Good Game,"this game is for those that love to play with friends and wacky game characters, no online sadly, but its a fun game i played and missed, but i have it now :)"
4,beautiful voice and energy,"if you are a fan of Tori Amos and/or Kate Bush, you will enjoy this music and documentary of Charlotte Martin. The dvd contains a live show she did in LA about a year ago (from the date of this review), and cd contains some b-side songs that didn't make it on her studio cds. Both are excellent; this was my first exposure to her music, and now I want to buy all her music and definitely want to see her live in concert. She is very talented, both vocally and on the piano."
4,Better than Gore Vidal,"Byrd's book is similar to Gore Vidal's Empire. There's a heavy dose of the execrable Henry Adams and his repulsive colleagues in both books. The tone and tenor of the two books is similar. The difference is that Byrd has created several very interesting and sympathetic characters: the fictional journalist Trist, the pathetic Clover Adams, and, of course, Grant himself. Grant is a saintly figure -- something of a fool to be sure, but an admirable, saintly fool. Thus, I finished Byrd's book and enjoyed it -- and I cast Vidal's aside after a hundred pages."
1,Don't bother.,"You would think that a novel entitled ""Grant"" with an image of Ulysses S. Grant on the cover would be about Ulysses S. Grant. This one is - but only some of the time. Most of the time, however, the reader has to wade through an uninteresting sub-plot about Henry Adams, Senator Don Cameron, his sexy wife, a pair of uninteresting books by an unknown writer and an armless Civil War veteran - all too tangential to the Grant story.I love reading books about Ulysses S. Grant; he's one of my very favorite American historical characters. I've read every biography I can find. But this book was an enormous disappointment."
3,"Interesting, flawed","Perhaps because this is the first book I have read about Grant (despite being a history major) I found this book interesting. It gave a lot of background on Grant's formative years and events leading up to his taking command of the Union forces. However, I agree with previous reviewers, the subplot was perplexing and therefore distracting. What was the point of including it, and placing so much focus on it? Overall, though, pretty good read if you like historical fiction."
2,War Gods seems to lack everything,"Ouch. Midway really messed up. War Gods seems to have a little bit of every 1 vs. 1 fighting game. It can most definitly be defined as Mortal Kombat meets Killer Instinct. (For the SNES) Now based on that you'd think this game would rule right? WRONG! It's a shame they took the worst things about Mortal Kombat and Killer Instinct. With practically 2D graphics the game looks horrible. Every time you get kicked this huge puddle of blood just goes flying out of you, which also looks extremely 2D. CPU gets better as you go along, and I don't mean a small bit like it most games, I mean once you kill the first guy the next guy is 10x harder. With a poor variety of characters, extremely sloppy control, and since CPU players can execute specials (Which you have to execute by pressing a series of buttons on the N64 controller) this game gets a 2 in my book."
1,Very boring and uninspired,"War Gods was terrible in the Arcade... then why was it brought to the home system??? Seriously, this game already required a labotomy to play because the controls, gameplay and graphics were bad in the Arcade. Now it's even worse on the home system because now you still need that labotomy, a root canal and an eye appointment when they put the blue thing in your eye to play this game!War Gods is totally unoriginal. It's a total rip of MK and KI combined with the hope of some Tekken and Virtua Fighter. The controls, like I said, were awful. Nothing in this world could help you get used to the poorly thought out controls. And second, the game just isn't fun. It's just not and it's very difficult getting into this game because of all the bad perks about it.If I could give this game a zero I would. Seriously avoid this one. Granted yes there weren't as many fighting games on the 64 but I'm sure you could find one that was better than this piece of trash."
2,ouch,"(...) There is little moves and the graphics are soooooo bad. This isn't the worst game ever but it hurts when you play it because the controls are soooo annoying. There is a Kubuki Jo, a man and a women and very very bad gameplay. This game is knowhere as good as Tekken and never will be because this game is a bad game overall."
4,Not MUST but should have it,"i just got this CD, its not as good as the last 2 however UDO can't totaly let you down.For this price - you should get it"
5,"Sweet assembly, gorgeous fan","Assembling this fan is a snap - no playing with light fixtures, screws, wires and fan blades. It even balanced without adjustments. It took me less than an hour to put this up, and not having to screw in fan blades over my head put a huge smile on my face.The fan looks great in an ostentatious way. The blades are so polished that you can see the lamps and dangling chains reflected in the blades as they spin - a neat effect.It pushes plenty of air - in a large 2nd floor open area, the medium setting was inaudible and provided breeze just about everywhere."
2,A better selection is...,"If you want a much better read, try ""Four Seasons North"" by Billie Wright, Sam's late wife. Her writing is vastly superior to Sam's and you get a better sense of their life on the Brooks Range. The book has been out of print for quite awhile, but worth the search for a used copy."
5,"Heart Touching ""Flickers"" From a Century Ago","This is a collection of seven short films from almost a century ago, 1911-1915, produced by the legendary Thanhouser Film Company. Several are of the sentimental variety but there is a good variety of genres even perhaps the first film production of DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE. Among the highlights here are the very moving ONLY IN THE WAY and the poignant, unforgettable A DOG'S LOVE. This bargain-priced disc is an absolute must for anyone interested in film history, particularly silent movie buffs. Although a few have posted comments about problems playing some of the films, my dvd plays fine and apparently it seems fairly easy to get a replacement from the company if your copy does have a problem. This DVD is definitely one of the best bargains on the market for people who care about the history of motion pictures."

1,"Poor stories, worse poems.","This is one of the worst collections of SF I've ever seen. The poems are the kind you'd expect from a prose author, the stories are what you'd expect from a poet. A mish-mash of discarded detritus, this book must have been published to fulfill a contractual obligation. Not worth the money, a poor showing from an author who is capable of much better."
2,high hopes not realized,"All in all a rather lackluster set of music from the legendary Cropredy music festival. It does underscore just how big a loss Sandy Denny was.The set relies heavily on a bunch of female singers,trying to fill the void of the late Sandy Denny.For the most part they fall way short.There are a few fantastic performances scatterred about the 4 discs,but for the most part the music left me unimpressed at best."
5,Don Edwards Saddle Songs,"Don Edwards is a favorite artist with his song selections. Only a handful of artists perform the songs of the old west, including M.M. Murphy. Songs about horses and the cowboys who trusted and rode them 12-plus hours a day for days on end created an enviornment for strong personalities and hard times. ldf"
3,"Pretty good if you're up for some ""lighter"" faire","Peach (the softcore division of Vivid) puts out some pretty decent product, especially the 2000 & later stuff. This one's good for when you're in the mood for really beautiful, hot girls showing it all, & not up for the standard AV skanks going all the way. I'm a huge fan of Angel Cassidy, and you get to see a lot of this hot blonde in this DVD (but never enough, unfortunately). The unique feature here is the 3 camera angles you choose from - I don't generally use the extra features on these things, but this comes in handy and you can flip between long shots & close ups (good full-frontal & rear here, but no spreads, the close-ups aren't really tight & don't last long enough). Angel, Teanna & gorgeous Tanya Danielle highlight here, but most of the girls are good. Not hardcore, but good eye-candy - try to get it at a bargain price."
3,"Good, but it ain't goldeneye...","The one good thing about this game is the multiplayer, which is why I gave it 3 stars. When I was having a sleepover, we played the multiplayer mode all night. But there is always something bad though, and that is the single-player mode. I beat the game on agent in a week, which was too easy, but trying it on Special Agent was too hard. And the guns are horrible. So if you are bored you can get your friends over and play a couple of rounds of multiplayer, but otherwise the game isn't that great."
1,Not What It's Cut Up to Be>>>>>,"Where do I begin? Just about every review on every site thinks really highly of this game but, I think diffrent. I rented this game and had all the optional componants yet I thought it stunk. The worst part of the entire game is the menu, it's so complicated I bet the people who created it don't fully understand it. Next is the manual, it stunk too. It was hard reading and had everything in it except how to work the game. Even when I was playing (I played the whole game in and out within a few hours) it stunk. It was extreamly easy and wasn't 1/9 of what I expected for golden eye's sequal. It was also almost identical to the gameplay of goldeneye but with less options, being harder to use, and it was five times worse. I have to go but one last thing, I wouldn't let my dog play this it's the worst 64 game out there and no one should ever waste their money on this game. (atleast rent it first)"
1,Perfect Dark Sucks!!!,"Perfect dark is the stupidest game i have ever played. Even super mario 64 is better than that game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! it is cheap, sucky, ..., lame, ...."
1,Does not live up to Goldeneye,"This game was very anticipated by thousands, including me. However, when I got the game I was very disappionted! The sound is good, but that is it. Everyone is saying how much better the graphics are, but they look exactly the same as Goldeneye. The weapons are ok too. And remember the great multiplayer in Goldeneye? Well dont expect anything better, in fact expect less. The multiplayer setup screen in not as straight forward as Goldeneye, and the ""Dynamic Lighting"" makes everything way too dark. And if you do not own or plan to buy an expansion pack, do not even consider this game. The name of this game may suggest its perfect, but don't let it fool you!"
1,This Game Nails the Coffin on the N64,"I bought perfect dark because I thought it would be just that, perfect. This game is everything but. DO NOT buy this game! If you can please buy GoldenEye but avoid this game at all costs. The graphics are horrible, the sound just doesn't work. The controls are just plain BAD, and the difficulty is all wrong. I don't think this game deserves my one star. Avoid this game before its too late!"
1,The worst game ever,Perfect Dark is the worst game I ever played in the world. You can't get anywhere and the guns stink. Should have bought Hydro Thunder. What a waste of money!
4,This is one of N64's best games!,"I bought this game not really knowing what to expect. I've played Goldeneye 007 but I didn't like it as much as most fanatics do. Perfect Dark really impressed me. Even more so than Goldeneye did. It is admittedly a very tough game even if you're using a Gameshark sometimes. The game has a high level of replay value that most games don't seem to have. The multi player games are probably the most fun because they keep you challenged all the time. The storyline is kind of cheesy though. So I think that Nintendo was able to make an excellent quality sequel to their extremely popular Goldeneye game. This game will keep you challenged forever I'd say. So check it out, I think it's a fantastic game!"
4,A solid game that's lots of fun!,"How could RareWare miss the mark with this game? Yes, the maker of Goldeneye has scored again with Perfect Dark. Pros: 1. It has the same feel (interface and controller setup) as Goldeneye, so the learning curve isn't steep; 2. Great scenery and computer opponent skill; 3. Additional players can join in missions as hunters or hunted. Cons: 1. Even with the expansion pack the game runs slow in multiplayer scenarios; 2. Navigation is a bit confusing--one ends up pressing the Reset button a lot. All in all, an excellent choice!"
5,Greatest Game I've Ever Owned,"This is the best game for the N64. Quite possibly the greatest. Huge multiplayer,challenging,co-op mission,counter-op missions,decent graphics for it's time and overall FUN! Alot of people say that it was an unofficial sequel to Goldeneye because of it's similar engine,controls and gameplay...I suppose it's safe to think that--they were made by the same companies (Rare & Nintendo). Since I already own it,the only thing I can hope for now is if it becomes available for XLIVE Arcade. I'm willing to pay 60 bucks for this gem. Buy it...as a matter of fact,buy Goldeneye too. They both kick a*s."
5,Not quite Goldeneye,"Perfect Dark is a great game, definately game of the year so far, but it is no Goldeneye. Although this game may have more bells and whistles, Goldeneye was more fun to play. Not taking anything away from Perfect Dark, it's an excellent game, it just can't beat Goldeneye."
5,"Player's Choice ""Perfect Dark"" is a good sequel of Goldeneye","Heck yeah its a good choice,i just got it and i been playing it all night,didnt get a nights rest cause of this game and i still have not beaten it,i'm kinda person who beat every thing in the game,even get the hidden stuff. Best if you like 3d shooters games and very graphic. But i still say Goldeneye is better and a classic. :)"
4,Not as good as GoldenEye..,"PerfectDark is a good game, With a ton of stuff to do. There's even a Shooting-range, Where you can test all the weapon's you've got. But, still I can't say it's better than GoldenEye which is one of My All-time-favorite game's. Still, though if you like GoldenEye, you Should like this."
5,Perfect,"I loved this game as a kid, so when I had the chance to get it later in life, I just had to. Classic Bond shoot em up."
5,The Perfect Game,"When this game first came out,I had many doubts about it. I believed Goldeneye was the best game of all time. Perfect Dark proved me wrong. The 17 solo missions are very well created. My favorite level is the crash site,where you speed across the arctic tundra, fighting snipers, drone guns, and assault rifle toting troops. The multiplayer mode has many great options, including King of the Hill, where you take control of a certain area for 30 seconds. I also like the 44 weapons in the game, that you use to fight against troops. Altogether, it is a great game, and I'm starting to think it is even better than Goldeneye!"
5,This Game is Definetly Perfect,"I've been waiting for this game since b4 Dec '99. Let me tell you, it's well worth the wait. From the start up, I was totally enraptured. The storyline is wonderfully scripted that is backed by wonderful acting and beautiful cutscenes. The solo player missions are nothing short of excellent. There are tons of great weapons that are fun to discover. Perhaps the best feature of the game is the Multiplayer (called Combat Simulator in the game). There is a feature for almost every aspect of the game. You pick up to 6 guns, the number of computer controlled simulants (up to 8), their personalities, the arena, your character and more. If the game was released only with the combat simulator, I'd still give a 5 outa 5. Goldeneye was incredible. Perfect Dark is beyond incredible. A must be for any action fan."
5,Perfect Dark,"This game rocks! Everything is beyond all resonable expectations of all first person shooters to date. The depth of originality and game-play Rare put in to this title will shine for years to come! However, the only draw back is the dissapointing and often irritating drop in frame rate in multiplayer and co-operative modes due to the lack of hardware capability to keep up! Otherwise the is a ""Perfect"" title that no true gamer should be without. Highly recommended!"
3,"Good, but it could have so much better","I have to say (regretfully) that this was a disapointment. I love GoldenEye and so obviously I was looking forward to playing this. I thought Perfect Dark was going to be similar to goldenEye but a lot better, but the truth is...it's not. The graphics are really no better then goldenEye: the same gun effects when you shoot, the same animations from the enemies, and the same basic textures. The only graphical difference I can see are the exaggerated reflections on everything, which after a while just gets plain anoying. Perfect Dark is good, in fact very good...but it just feels way too farmiliar. I was hoping it would be a LITTLE different. Still, I would recommend buying it: great storyline, cinemas, and excellent gameplay. But would someone tell me what is up with the character names? Come on Rare, you can think of more creative stuff than Elvis and Mr. Blonde!"
1,"""PERFECT"" DARK is the biggest OVER statement of this year.","MAY I WARN YOU, BUY AN EXTENSION PACK ALSO, THE GAME IS ABSOLUTLEY BOARING WITH OUT IT.Perfect Dark took goodness knows how long to come out and all the hype for it was well , NOT WORTH IT , Goldeneye 007 was made buy the same company who made perfect dark and I have 007 and all the levels in Perfect Dark were 007 levels with a few extra items in them like Boxes and Doors, I know all the other reveiws say it is a great game with 5 stars but if you have no extension pack the game has only 5 ""PRACTICE"" levels and they are boaring as there are no people or any thing of that nature to destroy . A complete waste of money and un-entertaining at that , I hope you choose another games becasue with-in the next months reviews like this will be flowing in! 11"
5,Most Anticipated Game of the Year,"Perfect Dark 64 is put out by Rare, which also created Goldeneye. The controls are similar, and 8 guns make a comeback; they are even available in the solo missions if you unlock them. The only differences are: the graphics are outstanding (it's like watching a movie, and you can, too), the enemies can be up to 35 times smarter, the weapons all have two functions, and the multiplayer is out of this world. 8 computer controlled players (called simulants) can be added, and its devilishly fun. This game is a must for any N64 game library."
4,Nice,"If you've ever played Golden Eye 007 you'll find many similarities between the two games. They're both made by the same people. It's kinda like they took one good idea, made a few changes in names, characters, levels, gave it a different name and said, ""Here's something new!"" If you were a fan of Golden Eye you'll like that the controls in Perfect Dark are the same. There are a lot of the same guns but plenty of different ones. My favorite would be the orb gun that can see through walls and with good aiming skills can kill your enemy while they're all the way on the opposite side of the level from you trying to hide. I used this one a lot during multiplayer. Basically what it comes down to is if you've played Golden Eye, you'll probably like this. Almost everyone with a Nintendo 64 has played Golden Eye at some point. Most of the time get addicted to it. You might not get AS addicted to this one, but it'll keep you busy when you should be off doing something other than staring at a TV."
5,Picture Perfect,"GET THIS GAME. i don't care if you get it in 2001 or 2008, it will always be a great game. Everything about it is perfecrtI say again-GET THIS GAME"
4,Bit Short,The single player part of this game is a bit short and the multiplayer is where this game excels.
5,Alot of Fun,"This game is great.... i played it all the time last summer. it's actually quite easy on the agent and special agent levels, and happily, it's extremely hard on perfect agent, just like it should be. The multiplayer setting is alot of fun and you can set up the weapons and everything as you want. the only drawback to the multiplayer is that if you're playing with all 4 human players, and 8 or so simulants, the frame rate drops to about 1 f/s even with the expansion pak, which you must have to play this game. If not, it's pretty boring... only 2 players on multi and no single player."
3,Not the baddiest and not the greatest,Perfect Dark is like a double of goldeneye. Good weapons but one level their's a laser following you around which always kills me.Be on best alert of that level because you may always die there. ....
2,BAD!,"This game stinks, flat out. The single player is WAY too short and the story is messed up. This stupid little computer follows you around half the game and if you shoot it you lose. This games is nothing like 007, in that is stinks! Multiplayer is bad too cause everything lags."
2,If your Going to bye this game read this!,I thisnk that this game was just an ok game. it was like Goldeneye except it has more levles and more guns. Actully the only think i like about the game is you can play on teams with freiends agenst computers. they took away all of the cool carters you could pick from too. what they just need to do is make a NEW JAMES BOND GAME..................
5,Peerfect Dark Is Perfectly Awsome!!!,"Perfect Dark was one of the best games I've played in a while. I loved all the graphics, weapons, mini-movies, stages, and the music. I loved how you can walk around in Carrington Institute. My favorite thing was the fireing range. This was a great game nad I hope I buy it sometime"
4,Piece of...,"...junk! I thought I could really expect better from the people at Nintendo, but in the end they just completely let me down. This game is horrible, first of all its just a simple rip off of 007 Goldeneye and not a good one at that too. A lot of the multiplayer levels and actual levels are just cheesy recreations of the original Goldeneye sets. The sound is bad the graphics horrible, and if you don't even own an expansion pack (that is another $20 down the tube to nintendo) you got a big one pulled on you. I would return this garbage but I ordered it used for like 16 bucks. Thinking about it now I probably wouldn't have paid $0.02[American] for it"
2,WAY TOTALY OVER HYPED,"My god, I swear, looking at the good reviews you'd think this is a cool serious game like Golden Eye. It all goes well till you meet an Alien named Elvis, which yes, totaly took all seriousness out. Typical bad guy movements from Golden Eye. Also you HAVE to buy the expasion pack to play solo missions, which is totaly stupid, for the fact that the graphics are no differnt than Golden Eye its self. Im still really disturbed over the fact that its rated M, but has childish parts in it only little kids would laugh at."
5,Another Great Game by Rare,"Perfect Dark is an awesome game and has very good control, but the story is questionable. Dark is the pefect agent at her academy but she hasn't even been on an actual mission. Anyway, the graphics really take advantage of the expansion pak. The sound is really good and the difficulty is moderate and the last level is really really really hard, even on agent. Well no matter what games you like Perfect Dark will satisfy any gamer, oyu can't go wrong with this one."
5,The flat out best game I have ever played,"Perfect Dark is, in my mind, the best game ever. It has very good graphics for N64 to start with. Second, the gameplay is just incredible. Third, the single player missions are intense and fun. The plot of those missions is actually very good. Fourth, the multiplayer is every bit as good as and better than Goldeneye, which many consider to be the best multiplayer ever. With a good weapon selection, many characters to choose from, many arenas, many fun scenarios, and many difficulties of sims, this is just a perfect multiplayer.Many ask why this is M. It is violent, bloody, and has language problems. However, you can turn on paintball mode to eliminate the blood, then there is a language filter to expunge the profanity.This is great for parties because of the multiplayer missions, so take that into consideration for your possible purchase of this game. All around, I suggest this game to any person who enjoys first-person shooters."
2,the game is fun,but it didnt work when it got to me. it was too difficult to return in order get a new one.
4,Well done Rare,"Perfect Dark is tied as my favorite game ever(along with Ocarina of Time, and it might move to 2nd when Majora's Mask comes out). The graphics are outstanding and the weopons, characters,storyline,options,and multiplayer are equally awesome. My only complaint is that it doesn't quite have the same level of stealth that Goldeneye did. Such as the Facility where you could sneak around completely unoticed for almost the entire level. Other than that small, almost unoticable flaw(depending on what you like;explosians or silencers.), it is...well...Perfect."
3,"Ehh...an interesting shooter, with fun 4 player options...","...but nothing quite like Goldeneye, or any of the 007 games. If the price is under $10, buy it, it'll be worth it."
5,"A Perfect shoot'em up game, at last...","Perfect Dark is about a secret agent that works for the Carrington Institute. They have found that the Datadyne Corporation are in league with the hostile alien Skedar race. Agent Dark tries too infiltrate and gather information and try and stop the evil plot. Great missions, multiplayer formats, weapons, secondary weapon modes, and the game does not deserve an M-rating (a bit of swearing [h-ord-]and animated violence along with a tiny bit of blood when you kill someone]).Highly Recommended! PLease get it today!"
5,"This game is just as the title says, PERFECT!","This game is fun challenging and incredible. There is no way for you to compare to the experiance of this game unless you have tried it yourself. Each level is smooth and attractive as a movie set would be. The enemy come in various levels of intelligence where some would be cautious, scared, suprised, or hostile to your appearence, there are still those who will surrender. Frame rate is very fast for a smooth appearence but gets choppy when you make use of the games multiplayer capabilities. The only extras you should get are an expansion pak and a gameshark."
5,DEEP INSIGHT,"In the last year I have been searching for answers.It was not untill my twinn died and I got this book,(It was hers )That I finally understood what it was, that she was telling me. In dreams, you can and DO find the answers to everything in your life. And this book shows the way for you to heal yourself! Your spirit longs to be known, this book will let it fly!"
3,"A nice looking book, but symbols don't work for me...","I find myself feeling contradictory things about this book. I like the format, it seems very well researched and laid out, there's obviously a lot of hard work put into it. However, whenever I refer to this book to determine the meaning behind an element in a dream I've had, the explanation given just doesn't seem to fit at all (and some are so ridiculous as to make me shake my head).I am not an expert on dreams, but I've had other books which seemed to explain things better for me. Perhaps different people need different dream interpretations, and books. I can't fault this book in any other way, except to say that it just doesn't work for me (perhaps it will for you), when others do. Go figure..."
1,Why doesn't Amazon post negative reviews?,I purchased this video (Winterizing Your Boat) from Amazon and sent in a review a few weeks ago and it was never posted. There was also another review that was briefly posted on Amazon for this video. My review and the other review were less than positive. Why aren't these reviews posted?Does Amazon not post poor reviews? I will no longer buy anything from Amazon until I see these reviews posted.
2,Ummmmm.....not so good,"I read this book as part of a 2-book volume ""With Open Arms"". I can surely see how this was one of Nora's early works, due to the fact that it was pure drivel. Samantha was a spineless character and Jake was a pig. I'm so glad Nora has come along way from this depth-lacking story!"
2,Silicon Valley....,I do not like this game. The directions are hard to follow and I did not like the graphics at all. I do not recommend buying this game.
1,A waste of money,I bought one of these popcorn machines for the holidays and it worked about as well as a lump of coal. It did not even work once! It turned on and then in about 10 seconds shut off. Once totally cooled off it would go back on again for another 10 seconds. I e-mailed the company and did not get a response. I highly recommend avoiding this product.
1,disappointed,"If I wanted air-popped corn I would have bought one of those machines, this machine deceptively appears as if it makes normal theater style popcorn , but it does not. PLUS it came with a broken wheel."
5,Great Album,Another great CD by these guys. A bit more polished than the first one. Great CD and even better live.
1,Don't like it,"Big fan of most all of !!!'s catalog...but not this one. Don't like much of any of this album...at all. More just disorganized noise than the dancy, funky, rockin goodness that I've come to expect."
5,Great way to facilitate gentle handling of CDs and DVDs,"No matter how many times I told my daughter to be careful not to scratch her CDs and DVDs she would inevitably leave them lying around to collect dust and scratches. It seems finding the right case and using it was too much trouble. I purchased this CD Storage Chart and hung it on the wall near her CD player and she uses it (well, at least 95% of the time). It's much easier for her to pop a CD out and into a pocket where it has some protection.Well worth the investment. In fact, I may get another one...."
1,Alina,"I bought one... it supposed to be my boyfriend's Chrismas gift, only it arrived without batery and a broken propeller that is used to set up the time. When I got in contact with costumer service, they said they will send me a new one, and after couple of days they said they are sending the propeler.... I did not receive it before Chrismas so I had to spend another $50 to buy something else."
5,superb guide for sketching animals,"great book by someone who dedicated their life to the subject.covers just about everything you need to know, and applicable to all skill levels. Beginners can use this book and have a strong foundation based on construction and anatomy, more experienced can go back and add some of the shorthand anatomy. explore the media choices, and utilize the detailed tips that are specific to the various species. the one thing i liked most was the use of shorthand anatomy to have a correct construction and nothing more, it is rather elegant in that respect.The Weatherly Guide to Drawing Animals"
5,The best,I probably own most of the popular titles on animal art and I have to say that this is the single one that I refer to the most. Instruction is excellent with many drawings. If you want to buy one this might be it.
2,Horribly Flawed,"Unfortunately, this is the best book out there on the subject. But not for long...Master Tong's student, Yang Wei Jie is currently publishing his own book in English. He has already written many in Chinese.Besides the errors in point location in this book, the biggest problem is that it fails to convey the system that Master Tong used to choose his points.That's to be expected, since this is basically a translation of Master Tong's first book. Master Tong did not explain his system to his students until after that book was written.So, if you want to learn the system by which you can choose and find and create your own points for whoever walks into your clinic, wait for another book! Either Yang Wei Jie's, or one that has yet to be written on the clinical use of the system by someone else like Dr. Robert Chu."
1,Does it worth it??,"I don't know this book already out of print for a long time or not. Is it suppose to be a collector item??? Without any research and preparation, I bought this book on amazon one an a half years ago for roughly $150. After I recieve the book and I find out on the back of the book clearly written the price is 29.95 us dollar. Please think twice before you buy it. Dr young's book provide very similar information and the price is much more reasonable."
4,Printmaster makes a Home Computer Worthwhile,"I have all the ""pro"" packages: Photoshop, Illustrator, PowerPoint, etc. But when holidays and birthdays roll around, I fire up Printmaster.Why? Because only Printmaster makes it trivial to create fantastic greeting cards, posters, invitations, and lots more. The secret is the templates: thousands of templates for every kind of project you can imagine. Pick one, then start modifying to your hearts content. Or pick two, and combine pieces. Or start from scratch...My only complaint: The drawing user interface is a bit clunky. It's easy to select and review projects, but detail editing is a bit awkward.I like this package enough to have bought two upgrades so far. Go with the Platinum version-the extra art and templates are worth it.And buy some extra ink cartridges for the ink jet printer..."
5,User friendly,"Printmaster has grown through many upgrades, each one easier and more inclusive. It is self-contained with many opportunities for creative work. Highly recommended, especially for novices."
2,Its ok but....,"the old Print Shop Deluxe V. 6 is better. This program is ""easy"" to use, but then most are. I was looking for a quick use alternative to full power publishing programs and this is not the one.I have been using Print Shop Deluxe for a couple of years now. I started with Print Master Gold and moved over to the Print Shop after a year with it. I gave away the Print Master because it is so limited in comparison.Check out Print Shop and compare. I found Print Shop to be a much better value and more versatile product to use."
1,War of Words,"Lots of build-up, no action and dissapointing ending.This book was billed as a critical introduction into the upcoming Magneto story line as well as a ""classic"" battle between the ultimates and the X-men.In the end, it was neither. A long story without a true beginning or end and very little meat in the middle.If I had the choice, I would have skipped this one altogether."
4,Good but could have been Better,"this was a decent experience, Millar finally does something worth reading since Return of Weapon X arc and 1 year of terrible stories. what bothers me is the shortness of the battles such as Storm vs Thor which 2 pages and Colossus vs Thor all of a sudden lasted 10 minutes and Wasp wasn't even used at all. But other than that there is really nothing to complain about the story. the worst thing here is though the art, no offense to Chris Bachalo but his art is just terrible thank god this is the last time we ever see him."
5,Pretty Awesome,Pretty good book in the series pretty interesting how the ultimates and X-men mix it up.
2,Ultimate filler....,"I found the matchups also X-biased and without the huge dramatic impact of the Ultimates series -- Colossus tossing Thor around after Thor and Hulk go toe to toe? Wolverine shredding Stark's armor and taking out Iron Man in seconds? Isn't Iron Man the guy who captured the Rhino in U-Spidey without working up a sweat? C'mon. The revisionist stuff is great, and works in Ultimates, U-X and U-Spidey, but Ultimate War is only filler between the two super teams' Ultimate books. Poor use of continuity and very little action payoff."
3,"Ultimate, not quite, possible","Having avidly read the entire Ultimate Series up to date, this series in continuity of the Ultimate X-men and Ultimates series is fantastic, and a five star read but only if you have all other Ultimate X-men tpbs and the Ultimates TPB (by the way the Ultimate X-men #2 TPB, is on my top ten list for gripping writing)... Ultimate War does not stand well on its own, it is just average. It lacks pages, great action, superb illustration, but for a fairweather fan, picking this up would not be a good idea... for a fan, you cannot go without it!"
2,Serious disappointment,"I was on the fence as to whether to get this book, because I only get one of the two series it combines (""The Ultimates."" I've tried ""Ultimate X-Men"" and found it to be a disapointment.) Still, the writer promised there would be ramifications for both series, so I gave it a shot... and was seriously let down.There are definite ramifications if you've been reading ""Ultimate X-Men,"" but not much has changed for the reader of ""The Ultimates."" Even if you're into ""X-Men,"" there isn't much meat here. You've got four issues of ill-defined fights with little plot or intrigue other than ""Magneto is bad and the Ultimates think the X-Men are working with him so there must be lots of fighting."" This does not make for good comic book storytelling.In truth, I would have given this book one star, but I bumped it up a notch for the climactic battle between Captain America and Wolverine -- the way it turned out was something I've always longed to see."
1,"A biased, simplistic hack job","I have read dozens of books on early American history. This is by far the worst. I expect histories to at least attempt some balance. This book has none. It is simply big, evil, bad guys (Hamilton and owners of government debt) vs poor, oppressed, good guys (small whiskey producers in the West)."
1,Could have used some balance,"This is an interesting story of an event, now largely forgotten, from shortly after ratification of the Constitution. Rebels living out west (`West' meaning near the small city of Pittsburgh at this time) took up arms to protest the nation's first direct internal tax. This being an excise tax on whiskey.George Washington gathered an army of over 10,000 men and, with Secretary of the Treasury/Acting Secretary of War Alexander Hamilton, marched to subdue the rebellion. The rebel movement collapsed with no shots fired at the troops (or back at themselves). Arrests were made and trials were held.William Hogeland may have written a factually accurate account: I don't know. But he very clearly has a bias towards the rebels and against Alexander Hamilton. In this case, it may be justified. But I came away feeling like it was a historical recollection written by a fervent anti-federalist. A bit more balance would have been nice."
4,Pretty fun...,"It's fun until you play all the tracks... Then it's boring unless you play it only once in a while, like me. It's a good game but I wouldn't recomend it to people who don't like playing games over and over again."
3,"Not bad, but not good","An interesting idea for a racing game: fly the courses. The only thing wrong with the game is the limited number of tracks, 5"
5,A good rainy day read.,"Great funny characters that inhabit the streets of Long Beach, California; a wonderfully forgotten beach community trying to be remembered."
4,A Subconcious Album,"This is one of those albums that can shock you and relax you all at once. Whenever I listen to ""Now Forever Yours"" I feel like I'm floating, and whenever I listen to ""My Life"" I feel like I'm in a car about to hit a wall... I don't get all the bad reviews; this is a great great album!"
1,yuck,"YUCK....the singer can't sing, hasn't anyone told him...??? This CD is a wierd one. The bottom line is it's not the greatest. It's just an unexciting collection of stole Beatles riffs all topped of with a dreadful singer who CAN'T SING.....I suppose the one good thing is that it gave me a good laugh. I especially like the way their ego's are so big they have to credit which one of the incredibly average guitarists played which solo as well as who wrote what. Ted Mason is the winner here, he manages to mention his name 52 TIMES on the inside sleeve. If i'd sung as badly as him on track 4 (please please me) i'd be hiding under a false name or blaming the drummer."
1,NOT VERY GOOD,"Well all i can say is that it came out this month and there's already ""used"" copies for sale here and copies going on Ebay for less than the cost of the postage.....what you read about this CD and what you hear are totally different things....some of the previous reviewers (possibly personal friends of the band)""too good to be true"" gushing reviews are a little hard to understand....maybee it's just me but all i heard was a bland, badly produced effort. It offers nothing new and isn't exactly what i'd call ""art rock"".....i can think of plenty of other things to call it...but not that......sorry......just not very good....."
1,This is dreadfull!,"What kind of garbage is this? I've seen this band perform and it was pretty bad, the lead singer couldn't stay in tune to save his life. I thought the drummer was good though, very big drum sound live which was cool. But the guitar(s) was so distorted in a chessy 80s way, I couldn't really hear it. I can't really explaine the type of music this is, but it sounds off and quirky in a bad way. I don't know what all these references are to Modern English; I own nearly all their albums, and I can't find one name that matches that of the member of this band. They even performed ""I'll Melt With You"" live. Why? I can't recommend this album at all. It's truely (awful)! Oh well, I needed a new coaster for my coffee table."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!,I'm glad I'm not the only one who can hear how bad this album really is. So the dude was in Modern English. That doesn't make him good. The music here is self-gratuitous. It's written for the gratification of its writers/performers. Speaking of which - The liner notes are filled with repeating references to Ted Mason on this and that. How many times can you pat yourself on the back? The performances are really nothing special - so don't believe the hype. Bands like Oasis play this material a lot more convincingly. A very loose production. Buy something else- NOT THIS!
2,Not As Funny As It Could Be But Still Enjoyable,"Do you have a friend who complains about their job all the time? (Though in this economy they should just be thankful to have a job...) Do you want them to stop complaining? Well, have I found the fun/gag gift for you. 50 Jobs Worse Than Yours is a short but fun book that could make anybody feel good about what they do for a living. Unless of course, their job is on the list.Ranging from common jobs like data entry to the truly bizarre such as Chick Sexer (if you want to know what that is, buy the book to find out), this book is a great way to boost your friend's ego. Or shut them up. Along with each job there is a picture, dress code, education, job description, pay, skills, benefits, and drawbacks (many of which are obvious). A few jobs listed don't seem to bad though who knew that being ""The Before Guy"" was a job? Kind of sad really...I found this book at work and spent a good amount of time laughing through it. Great way to lift your spirits."
3,50 worse books than this...,"But it's a cute office book. The pictures are nice and the writing is comical.I bought this for my fiance' because he always complains about his job! He thought it was funny. Now, I think it's tossed on the floor somewhere in his office.For the price, good book if you need a small office gift."
1,Pathetic!,What are the studios thinking?Release this show in its entirety.I got my Cybill complete seasons 1-4 from Amazon.co.ukevery single episode!not some mish-mash of 'favourite' episodes (whose favourite?..not mine).stay away from this and go to the UK site and get the complete 4 seasons.
3,Not interested in a collection - want full seasons,It is unfortunate when you have to berate the production of a DVD in the same space intended to rate or comment on the quality of the real content. Does the intended message find its way to the right decision makers without adding confusion to those unfamiliar with the show?Cybill should get 5 stars for the content of the series. Well written. Great character portrayals by the ensemble of actors.This set is worthy of the lowest rating of one star. How could fan of the show be satisfied with a random collection of 13 episodes out of a full four seasons of episodes? It makes no sense to me. I will not waste my money of this type of packaging. Full seasons should be offered or nothing at all. This set is basically nothing.
2,A Disappointing Trip To The Wayback Machine,"I had been looking forward to the DVD release of Cybill, a 1990s CBS series that should have gotten at least one more year before cancellation. I hated it that the marketers nixed Cybill's theme song with some pasted-on theme (just as it happened on the Married With Children DVD releases) and that at least two episodes are two-part cliffhangers that do not even have the concluding episodes--one of them being Going To Hell In A Limo on Disc 2. I agree with the other reviewers--issue the Cybill TV episodes as they were intended to be packaged, in chronological order. This is marketing at its worst."
1,Clearly meant to test the market,"A brilliant series that was on for four hilariously funny seasons. Unfortunately, this is what amounts to market tester for sales and we should all hope and pray they release a box set here in the USA like they have just done in the UK (where all four seasons have been available for years). My low rating is only a reflection of my distaste for the owner of the series not putting out the full seasons, otherwise it would be 5 stars."
3,Why not season by season?,"First off, I loved this show. My review has nothing to do with the quality on that front. I am extremely disappointed in that this is a `best of' and not a full season of episodes. In addition, these selections do not display the show at its best. Where are some of the classic episodes such as Virgin, Mother, Crone, Cybill with an `S', As the World Turns to Crap and Sex, Drugs and Catholicism?Though any release of this show is welcome, it makes me only yearn the full seasons more. Now there are two shows to wish for: Cybill and Designing Women."
3,"If they are going to have a two part show, have both parts on the DVD","I loved this show when it was onthe air, but due to my schedule I didn't get to see that many shows. I have always been a fan of Christine and her character on this show reminds me of Karen on Will and Grace.All the shows were funny, but I found it iritating that there were 2 shows that were two-part shows and they only had show 1 on the DVD. If you are going to have a DVD that has a show the ends with ""to be continued"" either have the second show on the DVD or don't have the first show on at all. I really wanted to see how the show ended where they were accussed of killing Dr. Dick."
3,Cybill The collectors edition volume 1,This was not what I really wanted. I thought volume 1 was the first year of the series.
2,Limo Episode Part 2?????,"Never saw this series when it aired in the 90's. This is my first viewing. That being said, I am surprised that out of all of the reviews on here no one mentioned the fact that not only does Disc 2 only have 3 episodes, but one of the three episodes is a Part 1, with NO PART 2! I'm baffled as to why they wouldn't include part 2 of ""Going to Hell in a Limo"". It is just plain dumb and crazy to have left it out (shaking my head here)."
1,Don' t Waste Your Money!,What a complete waste of money. A friend bought this set and is sorry she did. There are two episodes that are two parters and what did they do? They only included the first part of each episode. How stupid is that! Include the whole thing or not at all. There is nothing collectible about this dvd set. They also changed the theme song. It used to be Nice Work If You Can Get It but now it is some song that sounds like it was just slapped on. I am passing on this!
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I didn't realize from the description that it was only a selection of episodes, in no particular order, or concern for continuity. It also didn't use the theme song that was most popular in any of the episodes, which was the reason I bought it in the first place. All in all, I'm glad I own it, but it wasn't what I hoped for."
5,awesome!!,"Although a fiction based on Native American legend, I felt as if I was in the book experiencing everything the characters experienced. It will make you stop and thing about the current state of affairs of the world today and wonder if this could come to fruition! Absolutely an awesome book - a must read for all!"
4,Great book for home dec-no jewelry at all,"If you are looking for a book with some great home decor items, this is it. I was looking for a book on jewelry (it said Jewelry Crafts after the title) so I'm disappointed."
2,Breaks Easily,"The 2 prong cleat bit is VERY weak - a prong broke on first use on the 3rd cleat. I gave this item 2 stars, just because the handle is somewhat ergonomic, the brush is convenient, and it looks like the bits can be used by a drill/other screw drivers..."
2,Broke on third usage,"Didn't last long. A metal pin on the end of the tool broke. You need a lot of torque to get out the cleats, and this can't handle it."
4,Good Luck Chuck!!!!,"DON""T EVEN BOTHER USING THIS TO REMOVE OLD ""FAST TWIST"" SPIKES!!!!. just like others, one of my 2 prongs broke instantly. after doing some research on-line i ended up not even using this tool to remove my ""Fast Twist"" soft spikes. i used a pair of needle-nose pliers and some tweezers. this tool was only helpful for putting the new spikes on my shoes. Its not the tool's fault. its the design of the spikes themselves. you'll know what i mean when you decide to replace your own spikes. the ""fast twist"" style is an oxymoron."
2,Bad marketing idea,"Let me start by saying that Buffy is my favorite show ever. Now, this product just isn't practical. First it is overpriced, only 2 episodes for $10 when you could get the whole first season for $30. Second, while I love the series premiere (Welcome to the Hellmouth/ The Harvest) I don't really think that they are the episodes to use for a ""starter set."" Perhaps if these two episodes were combined with a few from other seasons then this whole idea would make sense, however at this stage of development it just doesn't. Great show, bad marketing."
1,Awesome Show But Stupid Marketing Ploy!,"Okay there's absolutely no doubt that Buffy The Vampire Slayer is an awesome 5 star show but this DVD set which only has the first and second episodes of the first season is just plain dumb!Why buy this when you can buy the complete first season on DVD and get all 12 episodes of that season?Or better yet, you can buy the A set that has all seven seasons!"
2,I'll give them an E for effort,"In my opinion, the only thing this game has going for it is that it didn't have any competition in the field of RPGs until the Zelda action RPGs. The developers of this game should be ashamed of themselves for creating this. I bought the game a couple of years ago and it still sits there and collects dust. I probably played it for four hours or so and put it away. I want those four hours back that I wasted. Nevermind, I would just waste them anyways."
2,Horrible... could be much better,"Horrible.. way too hard to beat. although the graphics aren't too bad, it's just too hard too beat. Don't buy this game! It get's boring in about 5 minutes... There's only 1 word to dicribe this game: HORRIBLE!"
2,ok not very fun not very replayable... first RGP out..,"i didn't think it was very fun, interesting since it was the FIRST N64 RPG out, but technically.. it wasn't even an open ended role playing... i gave it away to a newphew who is 5... he probably will like it."
2,Not a very good game,This game isn't that great. You can't buy idems witch i don't like. The magic isn't very good either. I found this game has barly any social contact and i really don't like that. I thought it was very long and boring. The enimies you fight are pretty dumb too. Overall I wouldn't recomend this game I didn't think is was very good.
2,bad rpg,Ok this game was not horrible but it was not a great rpg at all. You could go through the game without speaking to anyone and there was barely any social interactment or character developement. The magic system was interesting as well as the battles but other than that the game was not very fun. The game is way too easy like many rpgs today and presented barely any challenge at all and was too easy to beat
2,Takes too much time to travel from various places.,"I already beat this game awhile back. The graphics, music and sound was pretty good. The annoying thing is that it takes a very long time to travel from one place to another. The caves are waaaayyyyy toooo long as well as the castle . Sometimes the random enemy ecounters are too frequent, like back to back."
1,Think before buying,"I bought this game way back when the N64 was in its heyday. I thought it wasn't very good and traded it in. Now I see somebody is trying to sell it for $89.95! If anybody is considering buying Quest 64 at this ridiculous price, I urge them to think twice. There are plenty of far, far better games for your money. I know there weren't that many RPGs for the N64 but that doesn't make this game a classic IMHO. You'd be better off looking for some of the excellent SNES RPGs like FF II and III or Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past."
2,"""Terriblly Horrible""","I wouldn't bother writing a review about this game if it didn't... so much! ... The game is repititious, confusing, boring, and childish. It pretty much summed up the game right there. Unless you are a huge fan of ""puzzle"" games and have a lot of time on your hand for something stupid, please, please, do not get this game. I'm usually not this mean, I'm just a little frustrated at the moment."
3,"Sad, Sad, Sad Game","This game as what I think of very poor graphics. I hate the way you have to fight every 10 seconds. The towns are so far apart, and there is so little detail about the town itself and people that live there. In Zelda (prefered over Quest) there was immense detail about the places. Although the world in Quest is bigger, it is by no means better."
3,a piece of nostalgia,"I remember playing this game when I was a kid and thats the reason I bought it. Playing it now really shows how much games have improved in the last 10 years. The game is really basic and you can hardly explore because you have to battle every 5 seconds, which gets really annoying. The good side of the game is that its a good way to pass time and remember the days when Nintendo 64 was the hottest thing around."
5,Quest 64,Very fun game....my husband LOVES IT!!!!!! He loves rpg games and this is one of his favorites!!!!
2,Quest 64,"I thought it was weird.I rented it from Blockbuster for a few days. I did not really like the music and I did not like that i could not buy items and that the people just gave them to you when you were running low. Like I said I rented it and so I did not get very far but most of the reviews said it was boring, easy, and short. I would not recomend this to anyone but some people liked it so maybe if you want rent it. Don't buy it, rent it. If you buy it you will be disappointed."
2,Eh...I've seen better games,"This game is pretty bad. You battle to much. The graphics are great, but that's not what matters. The game gets very boring and I didn't see a story (there might have, but not to my knowlege)...."
1,Horrid,"This is a horrible rpg if it can be counted as one. It lacked good plot, had a horrible level system, awful spells, was not mentally challenging in any way, had pathetic enemies, and had a pathetically easy boss."
1,Terrible,I bought this becuase it was the only true RPG on the market for the N64. It was terrible. Way too easy to beat - and really slow and annoying game play. The plot is terrible and the items are numerous and confusing. A waste of money if you ask me!
2,The Quest is not ready to be taken on.,"So the honest review is that it wasn't bad, it just fell short of many of my expectations. The company worked hard on the graphics and dam*it, it shows. The sound, however, lacked in almost everyway. The music is nice, but annoying syth makes it terrible. Also, most of the characters are a tad bland. But some of the things that do shine through are its environments, the worlds, the feel, and the quest. Its not too bad in the end run, but still, it can get tedious and even annoying at points. But still a pretty nice game over all."
3,The height of mediocrity,I got this game from one of my sister's brother in-laws and I think it was the right price the game is somewhat decent and is worth having if you're a collector a BIG fan of the N64 as I am or a BIG fan of RPG's.
2,Was great.,"First off my rating is high because I really enjoyed this game.2ndly it was a N64 RPG, which I don't remember there being many.You end up using the elements as magic and you mix and match to kind of make your own play style.The battle mechanics were odd, but I always enjoyed games that were challenging so you had to think out what you were going to do, sometimes you would lose a battle due to making a bad move, and you can learn from it and do better.Unless your someone who likes to play old games, avoid this one, there are games which are all around upgrades.Try Fate or Fable."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is boring. You are on a Quest to find your father. And you never do! Second, you fight in duels, and all the monsters are the same. third, a person shoots out water, fire, rocks, cyclones and wind out of no where. Take my advice, if you have the game, Quest 64, Burn It! Make sure you nrent this game before you buy it. Even if you hear all these compliments about it, rent it anyway."
5,"good game, note the best, but fun","this game was good. i liked it even though sometimes it seemed too easy or annoying. it was the only RPG for the N64 for a while, so i don't see what the problem is there. if you are going to listen to the reviews, i'd suggest you rent the game before buying. some people said it was really bad to me, but i liked it."
3,Worth a rent or two. Buy it if you find it for less.,"........ Well, this game is okay if you're an RPG beginner of have to do this weekend and drank too much caffeine on Saturday Night. Very, very short game. Also very easy, if you're somewhat experienced in RPGs. It was much easier than I expected. Well, anyway, if you've got a couple extra bucks and nothing to do, maybe you'll wanna pick this up."
2,boooooring,The game was a disaster and disappointment. It was nothing I had expected. The game play is terrible. There was no plot and it was frustrating when you can barely go anywhere. Don't waste your money by the better RPG's and save the frustration.
4,"Good RPG, short however...","Kinda sad that this happened to be the very first RPG for the N64, but it was however worth my money and time. When I completed the game, it was about 11 hours, about as long as the first disc on Final Fantasy VIII.The storyline is like a basic old RPG. Something was stolen, and you have to get it back. Not very original, but it's still a pretty neat game.The one thing that kinda disappointed me was the soundtrack. The music wasn't all that good, and the sound quality wasn't really great either.But this game is still pretty fun, and I do think that this game is fun. I'll be looking forward to THQ's next game ""Aidyn Chronicles"", so stay tuned!"
3,pretty good game,this was a great game but still there should be some changes for example and instead of buying as much as bread as u want with money or something u could not do that well see what i give it graphics 5/10 not the very great graphics diffculty 10/10 this game was crazy beacuse how hard the bosses were replay vaule 1/10 this game u can get bored from after u beat the game one time story 2/10 there was almost like no story at all
1,A slap in the face to RPG's,"I received this game when I was just a young boy for my birthday, my parents knew how much I liked video games and bought this...game...if you could even call this a game...........I was 8 or 9.............how sad that game made me.........I love RPG's and when I look back at some of my first RPG's I see this, nightmare, so here are just a few of the bad things to stop you from buying this.......thing......CONS:-One of the worst battle systems ever-Predictable, boring story-YOU GET ONE WEAPON IN THE WHOLE GAME AND IT SUCKS, IT DOES ALMOST NOTHING (just clam down, Chad, clam down)-Persistent, boring battles-Cheery, annoying music(and those are just a few of the things, I could go on and on)PROS: (if there are any at all)-Fairly good graphicsMy advice is don't buy this insult for a game........"
1,*sigh*,"I felt like doing an old game review just for the hell of it. This just happened to be it. *sigh* this game flat out well sucks... The only thing i like about it is the old school feel i get when playing it. The other this is that the spells look kinda cool. But in reallity the game has no real good plot combat system or even challenge really. If you wanna play this game, rent it, and then return it. Ya i know it was very disapointing huh, oh well not all games can be good. In all of my reviews..... IF you liked this game I laugh at you...."
3,Up to Date Ethical Situations,"This book is very up to date on the ethics surounding business today. It thougholy explains the different theories and concepts of business ethics. I rate this book high on content, but low on context. This is a good book but is long and dry, this author repeats himself and does not always get to the point directly."
4,Honest Seller,The book was used and slightly worn but it served the purpose. The seller was honest about the condition and that's what love. I would definitely order from them again.
4,The book with show the ethical in doing business,This book will provide you with the ethic activities when doing business. You can learn from the various cases in this book that show you how good & bad to doing you business. Ethic its about do right or wrong that much depend from the social standard. From this book we can learn much enough how to threat your customers in the ethic way. In much case in this book will show you the unethical activities that doing by the company finally they have to face the lawsuit or crash down. Just read this book first before you serve your customer in ethic way.
1,Awful,"This textbook, which we used in our MBA ethics class last semester, is unfit for use as a teaching tool. Velasquez is more proselyte than professor; he reverse-engineers his conclusions from political positions, and he ignores data that do not comport with his beliefs. Throughout the book, he displays an astounding misunderstanding of some basic, accepted principles of economics--including the law of supply! (p. 169-170).The book is fairly well-written and uses current examples, so the student without a grounding in economics will probably find his explanations convincing."
1,Too many loose ends!,"The basic idea of the book was interesting. The plot of the story had me very interested, however, there were too many loose ends and unanswered questions. Even if there was a second book to this story, it had too many holes. Also, the editing and spelling was horrible. On one page a sentence begins and it is never finished on the next page. I dont recommend this book."
5,Wonderful but unavailable,These fiber bars are the best I have ever had but they have become unavailable. The seller had to cancel my order because they could not get any from the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer and they are indeed out of stock. I fear they will stop making this wonderful product!
4,Thumps Up,"I was surprised by how fast I got the product from the company and it even works great, both game and rumble pack. Very impressed with the service, quality and timeliness."
2,Game Not Complete.,Well this game features some of the best graphics Ive ever seen and its easier to learn how to play than Rogue Leader but what were they thinking when they decided not to have a save option?N64 is a superior machine so its not like it doesnt have enough memory to support a save option and even old games like Metroid and The Legend Of Zelda let you save your progress with a password. This game is just like one of those arcade games at movie theatres because its fun to play for a while but pointless to try and beat it because it just doesnt let you save. The new Star Fox game for Game Cube sure as hell better have a save option.
5,Rosolino Video Review by Marius Dicpetris,"This video contains rare footage of the trombone master, Frank Rosolino. It is his best work I have heard and I highly recomend it."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Think twice before laying out $ for this clinker. It's a tape of two half hour 1962 ""Jazz USA"" shows, hosted by Oscar Brown, Jr. The photography is grotesque, the sound is bad (my copy had static as well), and the lighting is terrible. Sure, Frank Rosolino is a great musician; buy his CDs. As a pundit and singer, he's awful. And what a shame to be barely able to hear the great Stan Kenton mellophonium orchestra. As for Brown, well, he's best forgotten. A dud, folks."
3,"A Very Good, Small and Efficient DVD Player","A friend of mine owns this DVD player. When I last talked to him, he spoke very highly of it. He said the picture quality is excellent, and the sound is good. I took a look at it a few days later; I noticed how small it was compared to other set-top players that I'd seen. It has composite audio/video inputs, S-Video and Dolby Surround. I would recommend this player for any living room or dorm room, or wherever space is limited. Looks good, too."
3,SVCD's you can forget playing them,"At first this product looked like something great to own but after using it for awhile you miss the easy of the automatic dvd tray coming out when installing a dvd.. It is a real hassle if you have your player on a entertainment center.Also I thought Sony would be more modern the DVD player suppose to play cd, vcd, mpeg, dvd, dvd-r but the one other format that is used alot and it does not play are SuperVCD's. Man was I disappointed when I put my SVCD's in the player and it did not work.I thought I did research but I guess I was wrong, now I have to buy another dvd player.. I guess I better listen to my brother and get a Apex DVD player they seem to play everything. The vote is still out on DVD-r's.I'll let my brother do the research this time."
5,PERFECT!,"This is just an awesome little player; I also bought it due to ""lack of space"" in my computer area...now I can watch/listen to a movie or CDs (even my burned ones) while on the computer...hey, who needs anything else, right?We also use it in the motorhome, just plug right into the front of the TV, and [throw away] those videotapes....Delightful little product; perfect for our needs!"
2,Very Dated.,When I was a kid growing up with English grandmothers and my mother I recall them speaking about Flanagan and Allen. I recall hearing them myself as a young boy but on hearing them now they do sound old fashioned and somewhat repeptitive. Very good for its time but not to my taste.
1,No action.,This DVD was nothing that I expected. Complete waste of money. It was a documentary with hardly any action. We watched it once and will be getting rid of it...
1,have not recieved yet,"I ordered this movie on Dec 17, 2009, and I have not recieved it yet. I would like a refund or please send me the movie. I do not have money to just give away...I feel like this is very unprofessional and sloppy....This is my second notice on informing you that I have not recieve the movie. PLEASE SEND THE MOVIE OR REFUND MY MONEY BACK!!!!!"
4,Pet Grief,"Pet Grief being The Radio Dept's 2nd studio album and 2006 release is a mix of dream pop, indie pop and shoegaze. The album was met with positive reviews and Allmusic gave it 3.5/5. All the lyrics are included in the booklet but it contains no photographs but does have a list over whom plays what on the album. 4/5."
1,The Radio Dept.--Pet Grief,"When I heard the debut album by Radio Dept.(Lesser Matters), I loved it. It sounded like it came right out of the early 90's noisey guitar scene. Next I bought Pet Grief, and was disappointed. They have dropped their guitars--almost completely. Also they are using a drum machine instead of using a real drummer. Bad moves, this promissing band lost something. I can only hope they realize thier mistakes and go back to rocking.--Aaron K."
3,"good but not as endearing as their last one, or the black watch","lovely pop but they may have peaked with ""lesser matters,"" the earlier one. get that one first.also: investigate THE BLACK WATCH 'tatterdemalion' and smart brown handbag""harry larry"" if beautiful, melodic new orderish pop is yr bag.the melodies on PET are strong, but the keyboards are not as enticing as the guitar-heavy LESSER matters.very lame lyrics bring this one down as well--but the atmospherics are sure to please. it's nice to see lo-fi making a comeback.5 stars for the earlier record--this one is for completists.Pulling our Weight single bodes well for the future of this swedish outfit, however!"
2,"Great idea, poor execution","This product sounds great, however feels cheap and doesn't really work as advertised. Some balls even get stuck sliding through the tube. Very frustrating to use; after 2 days, I returned and purchased a real ""original"" shag-bag and have been happy since."
1,Poorly Done,Very poorly executed. The tube is too small and if you get some sand or dirt on the balls they jamb. I returned mine. Someone at Wilson should have tried this for 20 minutes before they put it on the market.
1,Good idea... Terrible Implementation,As one person stated before some balls get stuck in the tube and you have to take it apart and cram something through it to get it out. The dispense part does not work well because after you empty the balls in the tube the balls from the bag don't free flow back into the tube. Terrible purchase in my opinion. I took it back.
1,wilson ultimate golf shagger,"the tubing needs to be a little larger , some balls get stuck which means you need to jamb a rod in the tube to unblock it , this happens way too often for my liking"
1,No good,I bought a new one at a garage sale for 3 dollars.I also got a ball stuck in the tube.The flexible prongs are already bent.I wasted 3 dollars. :(
2,That's isn't it,"Well it's fun to see the girls playing with a lot of fun, they are really enjoying the game. You must know that this women are not looking like playmates, if you are looking for that type of girl. But the most strangest thing for me a european is that a lot of faces are covered, as many advertisement also. Is is because of some strange laws that nobody understands outside the United States ?"
5,Accidental Discovery,"I bought this CD on a general recommendation for Sons ...The Gospel Trails title didn't hit home (duh), so this was my first introduction to Sons ... Joaquin AND more significantly to the Country Gospel genre. Absolutely loved it. I'll Fly Away is an especially great toe-tapper. Since then, I've been looking for other Cowboy/Country Gospel (and I loved the O Brother soundtrack).Six cheers for serendipity."
5,Gospel Trails by Sons of the San Joaquin,"I am an old 74 years and still a fan of Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Sons of the Pioneers, etc. Todays modern gospel songs, like modern C&W are nothing more than screaming repeats of some sort of title. The ""Sons"" harmony and clear tones not only inspire, but relax and place a person in a spiritual mood. I enjoyed especially the ""Medley: Sweet Hour Of Prayer/Amazing Grace/Great Is Thy Faithfulness"". I am just an old cowboy who will never sell his saddle in the hopes that someday I can ride once again...it is also a remembrance factor of days gone by, trail partners who have passed on, horses who served faithfully, and dogs who never failed in their loyalty and love. Brings a tear to my eye."
2,Lacks originality with the obvious T. Harris bits,"Is every insane serial killer given an investigation file to help nab a particulary nasty peer? It seems that way with Walker. It was quirky and interesting with Thomas Harris, but it is dreadfully cliched with Walker. Also, does Jessica have to screw every man she's involved with in an investigation?"
3,Not for the squeamish...,"This is the second novel in the Instinct series, and it does not disappoint. Walker manages to build suspense and, through his vivid descriptions, lets readers get a real sense of what the killer is thinking during the murders. The ending wraps things up well."
2,Fatal Instinct,It was not a favorite....did not even finish it..I have tried to read the series but cannot get thru them. Fatal Instinct was the book
2,FATAL INSTINCT,"IT WAS WELL WRITTEN AND AN INTRIQUING PLOT, I WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW IT WAS RESOLVED AND THEN...IT DID NOT GET RESOLVED!! IT TOUTED THE READER TO A SECOND BOOK WHICH CONTINUES THE SAGA. AM I GOING TO READ THE SECOND BOOK??NADA. THAT MADE ME SO MAD I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO READ ANY MORE OF THIS AUTHORS BOOKS!"
5,"Nice size, works well.",I use this for grooming Angora rabbits on their heads and paws. This brush is a quality product that works well.
2,"Great Show, Not So Great Transfers","This is not the first British detective show on DVD that features great scripts and acting, and rather disappointing video transfers. The Poirot DVDs of the 1 hour shows, as welcome as they are, so far generally have the quality of mediocre VHS. I would say the Maigret shows are aren't quite that good. There are occasional scenes that are so grainy that they look like they were transferred from 8mm film. Even when this is not the case, much of the 12 episodes have little to boast of in terms of video quality.I would like to know what the rationale is for putting out DVDs that cost this much that do not have the very best image quality.The only reason I can see for buying this set is if your tapes are getting worn out, as mine nearly are. The stories and acting, of course, are wonderful.My rating is average of high score for acting and story, and low score for image quality."
1,Are they kidding?,"Disclaimer: this may be OK for people who have never read a Maigret.Maigret is chatty, witty, rides Le Metro, bounds lively up the stairs, and has yet to stop at a cafe for a morning Cognac, Calvados, or beer. I mean, it's like watching Nero Wolfe mow the lawn and work out at Pilates; or Sherlock Holmes making the bar scene, picking up babes. Madam Maigret is slender and makes witty repartee with her husband.I lasted 15 minutes before turning it of in disgust and amazement; my wife only lasted 5 minutes."
3,Picture qualitys ok--the storys are just a little dull,"I've read several reviews complaining about the picture quality in this set--perhaps it could have been a little sharper--but all things considered, I didn't have any problem with the quality of the video-the same can not be said for the stories-which tended to move along quite slowly--sometimes becoming almost boring. Gambon was much better in ""The Singing Detective"" which is not to say that these storys are ""bad""-but when compared to other crime/detective shows like Midsomer Murders, Inspector Lynley, Inspector Morse or a Touch of Frost the episodes here are inferior. Worth watching-but if it's possible to rent them-I would recommend that over purchasing."
5,Growth proves elusive,"Great book! Easterly combines mastery of a lot of literature with a very available style to explain why so many countries remain poor after so much money has been spent on foreign assistance. A hard part of the lesson from this book is that politically motivated aid to countries with poor policies and corrupt leadership is not likely to help much, but that the incentive system within the donor nations and agencies has made such programs all too common. Easterly makes the great complexity of work in developing nations explicit, and almost intuitive. He effectively challenges several panaceas for poverty. It should be noted that growth is not necessarily the most important objective for development assistance, and the gains in life expectancy, nutrition and education have often been better than those in GDP per capita."
2,Populism...,"is a word that would generally describe this work. My professor in macro economics requested us to use it as a reference for the development part of the course and I think it was a mistake. I would recommend Stiglitz's ""Globalization and Its Discontent"" instead, the general tone of which is less annoying when criticizing IMF and WB (and every other organization involved) in their efforts to help developing countries to cope with their overwhelming problems. Some references sited by the author are inconclusive and the reasoning is quite weak. Moreover, the fact that he has been fired from one of those organizations that he himself criticizes makes the impartiality of his judgements questionable."
3,A nice review of economic history,"Easterly does indeed cover the history of economic development, and he magically creates the image of poor people who just never had the right incentives. I will not argue with his historical accuracy, this part of his book is straightforward enough. Indeed, any competent historian could have related an equivalent story. However, where Easterly falls short of his title of being an economist is in that of what to do next. People need the right incentives... ok what now. Martin Feldstien gave us his theory, Robert Solow threw his hat in the ring, and as such they are economists, however all Easterly is is an economic historian offering very little advice as to what is next."
1,Elementary at Best,"I understand that it's a book written to be accessible to people like myself who are not economists and will NEVER be economists, but that does not mean I have to be treated like I am severely unintelligent. The reading level of this book falls far below what any college educated person should be expected to read. I don't think the author of this book is nearly as deserving of the high accolades (not to mention profits) he has been receiving for writing this book. When a book contains the phrase 'I think learning under the right circumstances is a very good thing' you know that the quality of the writing is deficient. It is elementary at best."
5,"Plain, simple, and back to the basics.","As some of the findings in this book are astonishing, the author backed every conclussion made in this book with indisputable facts. I was stunned to find out that, as developing countries invested more in public education in the last 30 years, their respective growth rates actually declined! This, and other insights in this well argued book (like the failure of investment to promote growth) are based on one very simple principle: individuals respond to incentive, good or bad. We economists sometimes forget that."
5,highly recommended,"A to the point analysis of an elusive problem, clearly argumented and at the same time highly readable and entertaining. Excellent starting point for anyone interested in development economics."
2,DONT BUY,"this might be cool for some games, like fighting games, but if you like rpg's do not i repeat do not get this. The controller is really sensitive and not good for games like zelda. the controlls always get mixed up too. DONT BUY"
4,My review,This was a good controller- i think u should get itSTRENGTH TRAIN WITH BOWFLEX FOR BEST RESULTS
2,"Sub Par Silverberg, only for die-hard fans of Silverberg","I love Silverberg, he's become my favorite sci fi author by far. With that said, this book is as close to garbage Silverberg will get. What a slog just to get through it. The book should have been edited to less than 100 pages because nothing really ever happens, a whiny, flawed, racist, ex-king/future king recants old stories from his youth amidst a swirling future backdrop that is poorly built except for small snatches. Only a few worlds and technologies and cultural ideas get elaborated upon. And I found the ghosting done only by gypsies into the past and present and future to be fairly stupid and ill-conceived. Some parts were interesting but most of time I found myself saying...I think I care, I think I care, I think I care, I think I don't."
3,Gypsy ed,"I think Robert Silverberg is projecting here--sort as in ""male menopause"". I have been impressed with him before--not this time. If u want a good eye on the Rom, try ""Bury Me Standing"". Does the constant bleating about virility have anything to do with the 3rd marriage? The conceptualization of the planets' atmospheres was sorta murky: I guess most space was needed to discuss virility and heaving breasts. His friend characterizations were ok. The time travel represented as Gypsy magic was an interesting way to depict lifestory and was mystical. I guess I've seen Asimov, Bradbury and Vonnegut, etc. grow older and stay fresh and provocative. Virility can b projected, guys, no matter the age, as in, Eastwood, Sting, Clinton and, may he RIP, Chrichton."
3,A good game to rent on the Weekend,"Doom 64, ain't all that bad, But as for Me I wouldn't buy it. I did rent it, And I enjoyed it for the time I rented it. But, I think this would be one of them game's that get old in a week. Doom 64, is a Shooting game. But, it does not have no Multi-player mode. The are a lot of level's in the game, But one thing that I didn't like, is They all looked the same pretty much, Just with a better name. The level's looked good, And 3-D. But, everyone and Everything in them, looked like it was paper glued on. The best thing to do, Is Rent it for a week-end And, see how you like it."
2,This is bad,"The graphics should have had a more 3D feeling. Everytime I walked around a demon carcass it looked the same as any other. It also turned so I only saw one side of it. The guns were cool the first time I played the original Doom,10 years ago. There wasn't any plot behind the game. A blind monkey with half a brain and no arms could at least make it to the last level. The ending was very bland. Everyone who played Doom 64 is now dumber after the experience."
5,This Game is Awesome.....The seller Never sent it though.,"By all means Doom 64 surpasses all 64bit gaming expectations.....A childhood favorite for sure. I wish that I would have received it from ""Samantha's Super Deals"" But no....They took my money.....And they ran. Now I have to go through the hassle of Filing a claim with Amazon. DO NOT WASTE TIME ORDERING FROM SAMANTHA'S SUPER DEALS! YOU WON'T GET YOUR ORDER!!"
3,DOOM 64 not as good as PC/PS1 but still good,DOOM 64 was a huge change from the PC & Playstation versions but is still an ok game. This takes away a lot of elements from classic DOOM but it gives us a lot that made this a unique port things like the Alien Laser & also gave us a new Demon the Mother Demon these were only on the 64 version. Unfortunately they got rid of Reverent & 1 of my favorites Heavy Weapon Dude. The 64 port has more puzzles than the PC/PS1 & other related versions it's like it's going on forever & really can make it boring the action was lacking but oh h** yeah the last level really makes up for it. Graphically 1 of the best ports but I prefer the PC version but controlls on the 64 version are good for the most part actually took advantage of the 64 capabilities. The enemies look good I say if you got an N64 you should pick this 1 up it's an ok port of DOOM.
2,Quake 64 owns this,"...because, for me, in this game there is too much running around going, ""okay what in the @#$% am I supposed to do now?"" and ""Where is the little arbitrarily-placed secret opening in some wall somewhere in the map which the switch I just pressed opened? Great, now I will probably spend 5 excruciating minutes searching for the thing. meanwhile I could be playing Quake."" It is too frustrating for me because these elements (switches, keys) necessary to keep the momentum in the game going seem to me to be arbitrarily located around the levels, whereas in Quake there is a ""rhyme and reason"" to their placement. One time as I was playing this they hid a switch behind some secret armor inside a wall, but I got the armour and missed seeing the switch because it blended in with the background color and pattern. when I finally went back and noticed it I was fuming. This game is no fun for me to play at all, indeed, quite the opposite, sir."
4,Not bad at all,"The matches on this DVD are pretty good. My favorite match is the 6 man tag match with Dick The Bruiser, The Crusher, and little Bruiser vs. The Blackjacks and Bobby Heenan. The other matches will keep you interested as well, good DVD to own if you like old wrestling."
4,Stranger Souls: A Good Beginning,"This book revealed a great deal about the world of Shadowrun. The characters presented were not only ""human"" in their actions, but emotions as well. My favorite character is Burnout, the cyberzombie. With this character, the author shows not only the firghtening possibilities that technology can have, but the consequences of yielding totally to the lure of power. It was an excellent book."
2,Difficult,Was a slow starter......couldn't keep my interest. It was suggested for our book club by a woman who is repressed by her husband and she was drawn to this book.
4,Good begining but not a good ending,"I bought this book on the advise of my friend. I dont say that this book is meant only for ladies, in fact peson who told me about is a male.This book is about 5 different type of people that the protaganist meets on her way to escape from the all her resposibilties and ties. But I dont think the protaganist got her answer for the question 'can a woman be single and still be happy?'. I did not like that ending at all. You gotta read the book to know the ending.Apart from that the boook seemed to be very realistic and self-retrospecting."
3,It's no Das Boot,"This movie's OK, I guess. If you're into fiberglass boat repair and all. Don't rent it for the special effects because they're terrible.Also, Johnny8ball needs to be beaten like the red-headed stepchild he is."
3,"Noisy, always spinning toy","My previous experience with Kid Galaxy RC toys for children led me to believe that this toy would sit still (and be quiet) when the child is not doing anything with the controller and then move when the child interacts with the controller. Wrong. If the bumble bee is turned on it spins in a circle (noisily) and if the child pushes the button then the bumble bee goes straight. While my children (ages 2 and 5) enjoy this toy, their parents can't take much more than about 5 minutes of the noise at a time. The toy is well made and the spinning tail is cute; just know what it does prior to purchase."
5,Woe the movies of are day,"This movie, one of the first, still in my opinion to this day remains one of the best. It was a beautifuly enthrolling remake of Goethes Fuast. If your are a movie fan, besides a horror movie fan, you should do your self a favor and watch it. Behold how a master piece should look, yesterday and today."
3,"Good, but outdated","Another reviewer is confusing this with one of the many film versions of Faust done as a straight drama. This DVD, however, is a 1986 production of Charles Gounod's grand French opera based on the first part of Goethe's work. It was recorded ""in house"" by the theatre and not really intended for broadcast or release. It's in color, but the lighting and camera movement is not of broadcast quality. The sound, however, is surprisingly good and is in true stereo. It seems to be a complete rendering of the opera, including the ballet.Despite its flaws, this is the best version of Gounod's ""Faust"" currently available. The only other one, the 1985 Vienna production with Ariaza and Raimondi, has better video but is, in my opinion, a weaker production and leaves out the ballet. I hope we will get a more recent, and hopefully complete, rendering on DVD at some point.Update 2012: There's now a good recent version of ""Faust"" on DVD, the 2012 Royal Opera production with Gheorghiu and Terfel."
1,very disappointing,"I find it hard to believe that people could rate this DVD with more that one star. The singers are very good, but... its recorded from an old video tape. The singing and the orchestra sound very bad. The picture is very dark and it reminds me of films from the begining of the 20th century. I wonder why it is sold. Oh, yes, on the back of the DVD there is a warning (in small letters) that some parts are not very clear (I don`t remember the exact words, as I sent the DVD back to the producers in Italy, and have not heard from them since... ). Some parts? all of the DVD is, excuse me, a torture to watch, and listen to. Lovers of Gounod`s opera wait for some good DVD."
3,two versions,"There are two different versions of this Faust available on the net. Both star Kraus, Ghiuselev,and Gonzales as the leads and Guingal as the conductor. Unfortunatly, I purchased a VHS copy of the poorer version, produced by the Bel Canto Society in 1986.Both video and sound quality are extremely poor on this version, although the leads sing quite well.The Faust drama itself is very intriguing (What do you want most in the world, and what would happen to you if you got it?)This music drama is well worth purchasing in the better version. But beware of used copies being sold elsewhere."
1,This is a bad transfer from an old VHS tape.,"I fully agree with an another reviewer (Dr. Elizer) in that this DVD is a bad transfer from an old VHS tape. You can actually see some noise lines at the bottom constantly throught the whole opear. Of course the video and audio quality is very bad. I cannot understand the people who are giving more than one stars for this product either. The performance itself is not actually bad. But it is not good enough to justify the suffering from bad quality video and audio. I rented it from local library. I watched it skipping a lot, and immediately returned it. Buy some good CD for this opera (or LPs - which I have a couple of performances). It's much more enjoyable."
3,"Sounds Fine, Looks awful","I just received the DVD of this 1986 performance. It is a DVD version of a VHS tape, and suffers from the transfer. The scenes are almost uniformly too dark--in many cases, nothing is visible. The live performance from Parma convinces me that I will never want to see another. Casting of the principals was good, especially Mephistofeles, but was done--as usual-- for the voices rather than personality. The choristers, while singing adequately, should never have been shown in close-up, as most were geriatric, and their movement was VERY badly blocked and mechanical. The same can be said for the ballet.All that being said, operas are for the music, not the staging; Ghiuselev, as Mephistofeles, was magnificent. Unfortunately, the sound quality is a bit fuzzy, probably due to the age and transfer."
2,Somewhat disappoited,"I remember seeing this opera at L'Opera de Paris many years ago. That one was done in 15th century costuming/staging. I fell in love with this opera. Finding an excellent version of this opera is most difficult. However, I encountered a BBC live broadcast production from the Royal Opera with all its commentary to be a better production. I only wish that it had the scenes numbered and had done away with all the inane commentary during act changes.This one was darkly staged, or poorly lit. But, something was better than nothing at the time."
5,Starcraft is the best game,"Before I bought starcraft 64 I read that it wasn't as good as the computer version, for example it had low resolution, but that didn't stop me from buying it. The resolution is pretty good and it is very easy to see your units. You may think, how can you easily control your units without a keyboard and a mouse. But it is not hard at all. You can easily select groups of units of the same type just as you could in starcraft for the pc. The starcraft version for computer allowed you to select up to 12 units at a time, but starcraft 64 allows you to select up to 18!"
4,gosh my kid loves theis,it is great i recomend this for any child over 8 it is very understanding but you neeed cheats so go to cheatplanet.com
4,Hooked on Starcraft,"This game is the best! They should make many more sequels for it,but it gets boring after beating the games twice.This game will stay around for a while."
1,"Sorry, but...","You're shooting yourself in the foot if you don't get the PC version instead.You'd be hard pressed to find a computer that cannot run this game. I can attest to this as having run it on a pentium II laptop from 1996.The online community has made at least 50,000 completely unique maps that are all absolutely free. I'm not exaggerating about that number, either...The community is still alive and well in 2011. Battle.net has its share of spambots and lamers but there are still an average of 65,000 players online(according to battle.net server info) and new maps being made. All this fourteen years after this game was released. The servers will never die. If AT&T; ever shut off battle.net, the community would personally overthrow the US government to get it back on.I don't know how you could even play an RTS with the n64 controller. Why are you still here reading this? Go get the PC version."
4,StarCraft: Review,"Starcraft is an exciting game with a good plot, and requires strategic thinking. It is challenging when facing the AI, because they like to perform sneaky attacks. The Terrans (good guys) are fun to be because they can fly their bases anywhere (except for the water, you can't land there), and they are very powerful up in the air. The Protoss is also fun to be, because they look kinda cool, and have powerful ground and air forces. The Zerg (main enemy) is an evil race that doesn't have any machines, their ships are all alive. I really like this game because of the multiplayer option."
5,Masters Review,"This game was brought out on computer, but it belongs to console! StarCraft 64 will blow your mind, with all the possoble outcomes, this one you got to have!"
2,just buy the coumputer version,"this game dosen't have the campaign editor or the internet game of the original StarCraft, witch in my mind makes it about one-third as fun as the original."
3,PC is better,"This is a great game and it beats C&C by far, but I'd have to say the PC version is much better. 1. The Graphics are much better on the PC. 2. The Price is cheaper. 3. They took out half of the lines that units say when you click on it. 4. Where are those beatiful Cinematic Sequences! If you are gonna Get Starcraft get the PC version"
5,Great book if you want to learn more about thin client computing for Windows.,"This book has a lot of diagrams and examples on what is thin client computing, and what it is used for, and how I can use it to save time, money, and hassle by using thin clients instead of regular non-thin computers."
2,Baloney! Citrix's turn-key solution,"Working at a top 5 technology consulting firm, and seeing the everyday hassels of PC's, Citrix's turn-key solution in the next big thing. I was highly anticpating this book and it did not dissapoint. It came complete with references for other companies that use WinFrame and did a pretty good job of describing the technology at work. (even a novice could understand this technology) Good book!Forget TURN-KEY! Citrix and Microsoft constantly point the finger at each other when an error occurs.Metaframe is a neat IDEA, but it just does NOT work!"
1,Sending mine back,"I thought the first few chapters were really funny and enjoyed the book, but then I got tired of the author's attempt at wit and didn't appreciate some of her language. I actually bought 4 books and had planned on giving them to scrapping friends but am sending them back."
2,Not what I was expecting,Save your money and if truly interested borrow from a friend. Offered nothing of use for scrapbooking. Just tells her story of limited creativity in a family of scrapbookers. Bored me so much I put it down for weeks before I picked it up again to finish. I should have left it sit and forgotten about it.
1,Warning: This is not Ayn Rand.,"Like any great artist, Ayn Rand has her share of people who are trying to leech off of her success. This book is a shining example of someone trying to cash in on her famous name. If you want to know more about Ayn Rand you can read her novels, not someone's book whose only claim to fame is that they have the two words Ayn Rand in its title. This is not Ayn Rand."
1,not objectovist in principal jlb toronto,to understand rand you should look to thoes that did not camp her with her enemies. libertarians are anti-reason and hostile to rand as they should be. her works will refute this book.
3,Small trooper army,"This set is not ""deluxe"", as it reads on the packaging. There are three clone troopers that are not deluxe at all, just cheap. They do not have any articulated spots, they just kneel, lie or stand on the the ground, depending on which figure. There are also 3 color variations: a standing red one, a kneeling green one and a lying blue one. All three variations are new paints schemes that were not seen in the movie. I wish Hasbro would make a better version of the green one, it looks pretty cool.This 3-pack is good for collectors who do not play with their figures, it has very limited playability."
5,One of N64's best racing games......,"I was one of the unfortunate few who purchased Cruisin USA, (the worst racing game for N64) and I had trouble believing anyone that told me to purchase the sequal. Finally, after playing the game at a friend's house, I immediately went out and bought it. Midway really woke up after bombing ""USA"" and created an interesting racing game. The cool cars and tracks keep you busy for hours. And surprisingly, the game can handle four players playing at once. Also, if you didn't know, the third game, Cruisin Exotica has been released. (I know, not much press) It's even better than this game. Hopefully, Midway will keep turning out sequals....."
4,Truly a cool game!,"Crusin' World is absolutely a great game! The courses are so fun and have neat scenery, like on Hawaii, there is the underground aquarium, and on China, the Great Wall of China. There are neat cars, also. On this game, there is no such thing as a slow car. They all have high speeds and are stylish. You can also get bonus cars, which are all really neat. The graphics are really neat, they have great details. I like how you can get bonus points for doing tricks. The easiest ones are the Mega Roll, and Jump Flip. The best course for tricks is without a doubt Germany. Crusin' World is one of the best racing games Nintendo has produced. If you enjoyed this, you'll probably like Crusin' USA. I recommend this to absolutely everybody!"
5,fun game,Love this game my girl play wit me all the time and we go at it the fun part about it is when we play with four people we kick there butts bc we already know the boards lol.
2,Who Needs Brakes?,"I must admit that this game is not totally without its charm. However, if you are looking for racing action at its finest, then don't bother. Perhaps what turned me off the most to this game was the lack of challenge. First, there is absolutely no need for the brake. Mindlessly holding down the accelerator will get you through most of the turns. And strangely enough, every car handles about the same. It seems strange that a double decker bus can beat a pack of sports cars. The graphics and sound are not too bad, although the music gets tiresome rather quickly. All in all, this is definitely a game for rental only, unless you are the kind of person who does not like any challenge whatsoever."
1,Difficulty reviewing something never received.,"I ordered two Cruising the World in July of this year. I received only one, but was billed for both of them. I wrote to the people that I had purchased it from and received a note stating that they were having financial problems and my credit would be issued or a new one sent in a few days. Well, I never received either. I had wanted the second one for my grandson, and he has now asked for one for Christmas. Any suggestions??????????Barbara Ames"
3,"Too many ""ads"" near the end","For a new owner, this book is informative and readable. There is a lot of information on the care and feeding of these giant dogs and recommendations on how to train them. Throughout the book, there are photographs of the Danes and their ""humans,"" although some of the photographs are badly outdated.Be forewarned, however, that the latter half of the book is little more than advertisements. Although the author claims to be recommending the products (Nylabone etc.)there is more talks about the products than about the dog near the end. It felt as if Nylabone (or another corporatiuon) had paid the author to endorse their product."
4,Great Dane Information,I found this book to be very useful in its tips on how to care for and train this breed of dog. The only thing I felt was wrong with it was that I thought this author advocated only doing things one way and the rest were wrong.
4,Hobgoblin is a religious zealot?,"I have the same complaints with this that I do with other McFarlane books, too much melodrama, too unrealistic female figures, and villains that are all toothy. In fact, after awhile all McFarlane drawn villains look like the same guy in different colored costumes. On the plus side, I love the twist with the kids and the hostages and the way that McFarlane makes Hobgoblin a real mental case. On the flip side, making him a religious zealot is just a little hard to swallow."
2,ARRIVED BROKEN,I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT ARRIVED IN PIECES. THEY DIDN'T PACK THIS WELL AND I HAD TO SEND IT BACK. I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE FREE RETURN POSTAGE. I DO WANT THIS ITEM AND HAVE REQUESTED ANOTHER. HOPEFULLY IT WILL ARRIVE IN ONE PIECE THIS TIME. THEN IT MIGHT BE WORTH MORE STARS!
4,Good Product,"I found that these contollers work great. I have had mine for a couple of years now and have had no problem. They need calibrated every once in a while, as do most controllers. I would buy this product again."
1,An attempt to sell even more...,"The album with the original versions was good and it sold well so why make a new one with dull remixes? It's commercial and boring hearing songs getting destroyed with bad remixes, and that Ja Rule is rappin on some tracks doesn't make the thing more pleasure. I don't get the point of this, 5 minutes of this junk was enough for me."
1,total disappointment,"I have to give this 1 out of five stars, because I only liked two out of eleven songs. ""Ain't it funny"" and ""Be alright"" are tight tracks, laced with banging beats. ""I'm real is ok too, but I don't like it as much because Ja Rule can't sing. The rest of the songs fall short of the original cd, I've only listened to the cd a few times, and wonder why I wasted my money every time I listen. The music on the other tracks don't accomodate J. Lo's voice, and sound like a bad blend of terrible buzzes and whistles and J. Lo's weak voice. I'm sure it'll grow on me sometime in the future, maybe with a few drinks or old age. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend purchasing the entire disc. You're better off buying the tracks that you like separately or getting them by some other means. ;)"
1,Copy prevention damages computers,"This disc (it's not a true CD, according to Phillips) includes a copy prevention mechanism which can actually damage your PC, Mac, PS2, XBox, or standalone DVD player. Do not buy this disc if you want to play it on any of these devices."
3,Pretty alright CD,"Aight, I copped the CD and I was expecting it to be worst, but its actually aight. Dont get me wrong this aint one of the best CDs and J.LO aint the best singer. but I think for the most part this cd Is only good because of all the tight guest rappers and stuff. But without them it would be nothing. Thats all I gotta say.Songs are good thoughso yeah if you likesimple songs with good rappersand an alright singerthen get this."
5,J to tha L-O is TIGHT!,This Cd is tight. I really encourage any of J.lo's real fans to buy this cd because it is off the hook. This is an album that you will have to repeat and do not have to skip any songs. So it's tight to me. If you're thinking about getting it go right ahead.
3,Pretty good!,"I love remixes, and although Jennifer is not the queen of remixes, she doesn't do too bad. Of course I'm Real is the best. If you like remixes, I recommend it."
4,all the hits on one cd,"The first 10 tracks were awesome, then you hit track 11 (Alive, from that movie that no one watched...Enough?) and it totally deviates from the tone of the album. Other than that, I thought it was AWESOME."
1,Just say NO!,"Well, above all otha problems, there's one really big 'bout Jennifer: she can't sing! And by the way, she can't even write Songs! All the Remixes are even worse than the original versions! It's hard 2 belive cuz the original versions are already so bad, bute belive me, it's true! So please, keep ya hands off this cd!"
1,What The Heck?!,"Ok, first of all, I need to admit that I do have a Jennifer Lopez CD--the very first one ""On The 6."" It was a good one. But now J. LO (what a great abbreviated name, sounds sick) just comes out with bad stuff. Sorry, th Ain't It Funny remix is just pure garbage. The I'm Real remix is boring to listen to now. J. LO canNOT sing. Way to go, J. LO. Still big now huh? Don't worry, you won't have to suffer from being so big soon. There's no ""0 star"" for the CD rating, so I gave this a 1."
1,how was this ever allowed to hit the sales?,"one word-AWFUL!!!Thisis so bad it's not even something I will try to like.The only good song is the ""i'm real"" remix with ja rule, and alive is soothing, but the rest is so bad.So many songs drag on and on, and one song goes over 11 minutes!I think that j-lo just released this album to boost her popularity, and at the status she has achieved, it's no wonder she was able to go to the stdio and record this piece of junk."
3,"Mostly old stuff, some new sounds","This album definitely gets an ""average."" Its got all of Jennifer's hits, with some new twists such as the Pablo Flores mix of ""Let's Get Loud"" and newer/more urban versions of ""Love don't cost..."" and ""Play."" The highlights are definitely the Ja Rule collaborations with ""Ain't It Funny"" being the strongest song on this compilation. The new ballad ""Alive"" really isn't bad at all, contrary to the criticism reviewers here are dishing. This album is a must-have for any Lopez fan, and has enough good music on it for me not to regret buying it.."
4,J lo and 50!!!!,Yo man - 50 cent is on this album!!! One of his first appearances. And he manages not to sound like a punk like Ja Rule. 50 you Hot!!!! I can't believe J Lo dropped him for NAS when this song hit the radio.
2,Remix CDs are made for one reason only...,"Remix Cds are made for one reason only and that is to make money or it is because they have nothing to release and they release a remix CD. Besides this has already been done with Madonna, Paula Abdul, Bobby Brown, New Kids On The Block, Milli Vanilli just to name a few. The remixes on J. Lo's album aren't anything special and rehash the old days of remix CDs. It truly shows that things do come back again whether you like them or not. My advice just skip buying this CD because you are just wasting you're money."
3,Keep trying J......,"If you've heard the mixes of 'I'm real' and 'Ain't it funny', you'll realise they are the selling point of this compliation. And, unsuprisingly they are the best tracks.However, the inclusion of ""Let's get loud"" completely ruins any chance J.Lo may have had at credibility. Why spend the best part of the disc flirting (well) with hip-hop only to destroy it with this inane Estefan penned/produced cod-latino tripe? Even a remix can't save it. The turgid 'Alive' is bearable in comparison, itself showing the limited range of J.Lo's voice (and song writing ability). A real shame 'cos when it try's it's superb (and features guest rappers), when it's straight forward it's good (most of the single remixes) but when it's bad it's the pits (see above).Still, her best effort to date...."
1,BE O.G.,"IS THERE A SONG THAT SHE HASN'T REMIXED?!! SHE'S WORSER THAN BAD BOY, PUFF PUFF'S LABEL. Speaking of puff, thats probably where she gets it from"
1,how was this ever allowed to hit the sales!!!!!??????,"one word-AWFUL!!!Thisis so bad it's not even something I will try to like.The only good song is the ""i'm real"" remix with ja rule, and alive is soothing, but the rest is so bad.So many songs drag on and on, and one song goes over 11 minutes!I think that j-lo just released this album to boost her popularity, and at the status she has achieved, it's no wonder she was able to go to the stdio and record this piece of junk."
1,How low will she go?,"I must start off by saying that the album title must be the stupidest and most ridiculous title of all time.Jennifer lopez just like poop diddy cant create new material,so they remake old songs just to milk your money out of your pockets.These remixed songs are even worst than the originals.Has anybody noticed how she has to appear on the front cover of her albums.How original is that?Do yourself a favor and save your money on real artists instead of this garbage."
2,Wasted My Money,"I thought this album would be extended dance versions of her music, but the original songs are much, much better."
4,J.Lo rulez,"I AM OBSESSED WITH THE IM REAL MURDER REMIX. I KNOW ITS KIND OF AN OLD SONG, BUT ITS SOO HOT. THE OTHER SONGS ON THIS CD ARE OK, LIKE AINT IT FUNNY MURDER REMIX. OTHERS ARENT THAT GREAT. IF U REALLY LIKE JLO'S SONGS, GET THIS CD, IF U DONT, DONT GET IT. PEACE Y'ALL!!"
3,J TO THE LO TO THE TO MUCH MIX,"I had to listen to the cd several times before I actually liked it. Some really catchy hooks and beats. I would have wished for a more dance oriented and less hip-hop cd, but, plenty of mix to satisfied everyone's needs."
3,"Not a Bad Remix CD, but Where's Thunderpuss?","As remix CDs go, this release is okay, but it loses MAJOR points because it doesn't contain the excellent remixes of ""Feelin' So Good"" and ""Play"" by the superb remixing team of Thunderpuss (Chris Cox and Barry Harris). Why? Because the folks at the record label, so eager to maximize sales by following what's ""hot,"" decided to give this remix CD a more hip-hop slant and include only three disco-oriented mixes on the album. The best of these three mixes is Hex Hector's dynamic treatment of the single ""Waiting for Tonight."" There's nothing wrong with hip-hop, but it seems a little weird that Thunderpuss isn't represented on this CD. The 14-and-under crowd will be thrilled with the remixes of ""I'm Real"" and ""Ain't It Funny"" (both of which feature Ja Rule), but the more discriminating dance music lover will note that this collection is incomplete."
3,Really for True Fans,"With the exception of her collaborations with Ja Rule on ""Ain't It Funny"" and ""I'm Real"", the remixes on this CD are pretty mediocre. The original versions of these songs are much better. There's also a new song called ""Alive"" at the end, a ballad for her upcoming movie. I use the term 'ballad' loosely. Ms. Lopez should stick to her usual R&B/ Hip Hop style. Mariah Carey she ain't. Her vocals are adequate when she isn't required to actually belt a tune out. In a song such as ""Alive"", she is only leaving herself open to criticism for not being a real singer. As much as I like J.Lo, this CD was a little disappointing and is probably best suited for those who are big fans."
1,Stick with the original albums without the ghettostar duets,"Boy, was this horrible!!! I am a huge Jennifer Lopez fan and own ""On the 6"", ""This is Me Then"", Rebirth(don't bother-baddddd), and J.Lo albums. This seems like a prison reunion with all of her ghetto-rap buddies, which if you like all the talking instead of singing of Jarule and the other rappers, go for it. I much rather her traditional pop-style and ballads. This was too ghetto for me, no wonder it was only 25 cents on e-bay. I think I still OVERPAID!"
1,She tries to hard,"Okay, so just like Mariah Carey, ""J. Lo"" has to have a remix for like every friggin' song she has? And Ja Rule in *every* remix? Please. I wonder if her husband ever questions that; like maybe they got something going on behind his back.I really think Jennifer Lopez is trying too hard to get attention. She'll be unpopular twice as quickly, just like Mariah.The Remixes is horrible."
1,Terrible C.D.!,"I hate having the same first name as Jennifer Lopez! Her music is awful! This C.D. is awful! Don't buy it; it is a waste of money!Also, I hate Jennifer Lopez as a person. She grew up poor, yet she never gives any aid to poor people. She doesn't care about anything but money.I hate having the same first name as Jennifer Lopez! Her music is awful! This C.D. is awful! Don't buy it; it is a waste of money!Also, I hate Jennifer Lopez as a person. She grew up poor, yet she never gives any aid to poor people. She doesn't care about anything but money.(...)"
5,J.Lo at her remixed best!,"I bought this CD, because I love J. Lo's voice. I loved, every single song on this CD. The best songs are : ""I'm Real"", ""Ain't It Funny"" and ""If You Had My Love""! Just buy the dang CD already! I don't even know why they put an Explicit sticker on it. The only song with language is ""I'm Real""!"
4,a remix album worth your time,"now J-Lo isnt my exact type of music. i dont listen to that much pop music.. im more of an eclectic music listener... but anyway from a standpoint that this was my type of music, its a great album. while most remix albums provide unfamiliar stylings of favorite songs, this remix album actually has hits on it. the I'm Real remix was number one for 6 weeks last year, and is still a great tune. the new single remixed by Ja Rule, ""Aint it Funny"", is not as good of a remix in either way but still gives you reason to buy the album because it cant be found on her other one. It also has some bonus tracks not remixed, from her concert, as well as some other stuff. So if you are a fan, its pretty much worth your money to buy this. (it also has a shot at going to number 1- it will debut with around 140,000 copies according to...)"
4,Great but could of been better !,"First of all, just so you know I really like Jennifer Lopez' music. But I was expecting better. I think i have heard better remix's of her stuff in clubs to be honest. But this is a good cd none the less... i give it 4 stars. Not 5 because, I think it could have been better, but she does make you want to get up and dance....Great workout or running material..."
4,Sounds Great!!!,This really is Jennifer Lopez at her best! Been looking for a CD to jam out to while you are on the treadmill? Look no further. Great remixes of some great songs. The standout is #5 Walking on Sunshine! Put this your CD player and get ready to work it!!
4,The better of her 3 cds,"This cd is really good. Some of the remixes not only liven up the originals, but some even surpass them (Waiting for Tonight, Let's get Loud,I'm Gonna be Alright). The only slow song is the ballad Again, which to me is the best of her ballads (or the only one good enough). The only remixes I didn't like were: Feelin so Good and Walking on Sunshine. The only cd I recommend buying from her catalog (haven't heard the new one yet)."
2,Wrestling Gold Volume 5 Beat Me If You Can,"A bunch of matches from the 70's and 80's. Mostly NWA Southwest and CWA. The Central States match features a young Marty Jannetty, when he was an Uptown Boy. Also, look for a young Magnum TA (Terry Allen). For the Southern wrestling fan......NWA Central States. Wahoo McDaniel/Uptown Boys vs. Grapplers/Ted Oates.NWA Toronto. Tiger Jeet Singh vs. Sheik in a Mud Wrestling Match.NWA Southwest. Terry Allen vs. Nick Bockwinkel.NWA Southwest. Wahoo McDaniel vs. Tully Blanchard.NWA Southwest. Tito Santana vs. Kelly Kiniski.NWA Southwest. Scott Casey/Terry Allen vs. Gino Hernandez/Tully Blanchard.NWA Southwest. Ivan Putski vs. Eddie Mansfield.CWA. Jerry Lawler vs. Eddie Gilbert.CWA. Terry Taylor vs. Sabu The Wildman for the AWA Southern Title.CWA. Austin Idol vs. Massao Ito for the AWA International Title.Tom Jones vs. Sheik.Bobo Brazil vs. Michael Angelo."
5,chapter 6.....not the last,"hey ppl this cd is 175 all the way through like chapters 4 and 5. the 1st song is really good and then when song 4 comes on, you just lose the feeling of dancing. then ""euphoric state"" comes on (by the way this is dj dna's last song) and it really gets you pumped. toy town just has you jumping and dancing. then around song 14, the cd slowly dies away.......BUT..do not worry ppl, anabolic frolic is working on a new cd :) ohh, and for all the ppl out there who believe the 140 bpm thing on the back of the cds, WRONG!!!! the speed limits are:chapter 1: 170-175chapter 2: 170-175chapter 3: 172-all the way throughchapters 4, 5, & 6 are 175 bpm all the way through"
5,Moo moo!,Damn HOW THE HECK AMI SUPPOSED TO REVIEW THIS WITH NO TRACK SAMPLES!?YOU FOOLS YOU WILL DESTROY US ALL!!*reverts to maniacal laughter*
5,Moocow!!,"THIS ALBUM IS DOG POO.THIS ALBUM IS GREAT!!DIE FROLIC DIEYay for whatever songs are on here, i don't know what they are, so how am i supposed to review this?!"
1,Information Out of Date,"This book is extremely left-wing grass roots. It assumes all doctors (with rare exception) are evil entities who are unwilling to listen to their patients and care little for them. Even more insulting, it assumes all pregnant women are sheep who will blindly follow whatever their doctors say, without question. This condescending tone prevails throughout the book.If you can get past the jargon, there is some excellent information buried in there regarding specific herbal remedies, etc. Just be prepared to sift through a lot of garbarge for very little content."
2,A valuable collection of tools -- I wish,"Sorry, I read this book, but didn't think much of it. I was able to pick up a few valuable tidbits, but overall thought the book's title and promise didn't deliver.Avoiding bugs, it seems, has much to do with following good programming practices and perhaps that should have been the book's title. Much wasted time is spent on telling us how to indent lines of code, how to line up our comments, and admonitions to fix our own bugs and to be alert when you test.There was 20 pages of good stuff and the rest was fluff. It was as if Rod Stephens needed to put out a book fast and just shotgunned his many years of programming experience at us, hoping something would stick and save us from having too many bugs.I realize I now own 4 of his books, but none are even in my top 10 Visual Basic books. If I could have read the book first and then paid for it, I would have paid 5 bucks."
5,A good book because it's lessons stick with you while coding,"The rule format of the book is a great way to learn how to write good code. You find yourself quoting the book while your coding. Covers heuristics that many ""self taught"" programmers cannot learn anywhere else."
4,Good treatment of VB error handling techniques.,"For me, this book was at its best when Rod describes VB specific error raising and handling behaviors. There's also alot of advice about general programming concepts and habits. These parts of the book are ok, but I think those topics are handled better in Steve McConnell's ""Code Complete""."
1,Beginners only book,"I found this book to be only for beginners. It is very repetitive about a lot of stuff that you just know if you have programmed for more than a month. Most of the suggestions it makes are pointless or just too obvious, and i can't believe you can write so many pages with so little content. In conclusion, if you have used Visual Basic for more than a month, you must NOT buy this book, it wont help in the littlest bit. Please excuse my English if i've written something wrong."
2,"Lacks a lot, technically","The quality of the sound is so bad that it often is difficult to follow the dialogue. Color often is quite faded in parts. The six mysteries are not bad. Of interest to Dick Francis fans, but still a disappointment."
3,Mistaken Information,"While the piece that I received was great for what it was, it is NOT a set as advertised on amazon.com. Although amazon does say that it is a six piece set, only one was shipped. However, Barron's was great about it and made the return process very simple. Apparently, they give amazon the information and amazon labels the product, and this time amazon definitely got it wrong. It's a shame... I would have loved to have saved the advertised 88%."
3,PERHAPS YOU HAD TO BE THERE,"There is something about the recording of this night that sucks much of the life out of this CD. I suspect the actual live performance was much more exciting to listen to. As it stands, this is an ""average"" CD with the exceptions of ""Asia Minor"", ""Where The Rain Begins"" and ""Party Song"" interesting enough to recommend. This is too bad because after hearing so much about Tom Harrell I was wanting to like this much more. Maybe next time."
2,Misrepresentation,"This was a disappointment. While the fit is good for two high backed cane chairs I wanted to cover, the color is completely off and misrepresented on this site. I wanted a white, cream colored or natural linen color for these chairs to complement furniture already in the room. Looking at this photo that's what I thought I was purchasing. NOT SO!! The color turned out to be a dark khaki--almost olive---nothing I'd ever associate with a color deemed ""linen"""
1,not happy,"The color selection on the site says ""white"" but shows more of a taupe. Should have trusted the pic. Thought we ordered white got taupe"
4,"Liked the quality, but didn't fit",I ordered these covers for my dining room chairs. I was concerned that they may not fit because my chairs are a bit oversized. The back was a little tight and the cover did not fit well over my cushions. If you have average size chairs there would have been no problem. I did like the material. It felt as though it would have been fine for my purpose. I had hoped the color would be a little lighter. It was more toward a sage green. I returned the covers because of the fit.
3,"OK fit, thin fabric though",The fit was fine and the color was great - I got the Claret - we call it red. The slipcover went over a white fabric chair and i was about to order enough for the rest of our dining set but it left a ton of lint all over the chair. I am going to wash it and see if this problem gets fixed after a washing. Also the fabric is very thin - in the picture it looks thick but up against the light you can see right through it. For the price though you get what you pay for I suppose.
3,Further character development,"The setting for this book is changed considerably from Hawk Haven and New Kelvin to a more exotic locale with a socio-religious culture quite different from anything seen earlier. Ms. Linkskold allows the tension in Firestarter between her human and lupine natures to intensify with a not entirely surprising result. You will find some old ""friends"" and some remarkable new characters, not the least of which are ""Wise"" as opposed to ""Royal"" animals. Like her other books, this one stands alone with a plot that connects to the previous plots and looks forward to yet untold stories but that is entire and complete in itself. If you enjoyed the first three, you will probably enjoy this one."
2,bad grip,This controller has pretty bad grip. And it may cost less then a normal controller but its MUCH MUCH Worse. Mine broke 2 weeks after i got it.
1,garbage no.2,"Folks save your money. I made the mistake of buying both 1 and 2 of this video. I got robbed twice. these videos are nearly useless.This one has about five to ten minutes of the most basic info. the rest is puff. I hope amazon,will pull these tapes from being sold on their site. Its a shame when someone pays good money to learn something,and all I learned is that these people are crooks."
5,I am still Impressed,"I seen this event take place live and when I left the fight I said to myself I have to own that movie, I have to watch Pete Willaims fight again. This movie is basically awesome on it's pwn, but if your a Lion's Den fan this movie is as good as it gets. It does have some matches that go to judges but is also has some submissions and Knockouts. It is a solid movie."
1,=sucks,I cant bleave this I got it for christmas and i thought it would be a little more fun the point is if you like games like zelda wrestlemania 2000 or even DK 64 this wouldent be for you but if you are some nerd who lives for chess then this is for you
2,Crappy quality,"The metal plate came in dented, and fell off within ten minutes. The book is crappy quality. Don't buy it."
1,Disappointed,"Hello,My husband and I purchased this to use for our wedding snap shots. However, the first book we received was damaged. The fabric was sliced on the cover and the metal frame was scratched. We returned the item and received many apologies as well as a replacement. The second book was also damaged. We received a book where the frame was severely angled and not centered in the cover, the picture frame was also scratched in the the corner. If things like this won't bother you, this is a good product. We however were disappointed that we received two different damaged products and will find a different book."
2,Ouch!,"This book is very thorough, very detailed, and massive overkill for any rational use. I just designed my first vehicle with it, and it took me most of a hour and I'm pretty sure I have missed a lot of the rules.For example: You are going through the vehicle design checklist, and you come to the step where you have to buy a powerplant (page 36). They are rated in KW of energy. How many KW do you need? It doesn't say. Searching the book, I find a formula to estimate in a sidebar on page 22, but the heading claims it is ""optional"" so I assume there is some other rule somewhere else. Page 61 has tables to calculate ""Thrust factor"" and ""power factor,"" but does not explain why you would want to know these numbers.If you enjoy idling away the hours designing vehicles, this book is probably for you. If you want to quickly design some vehicles for a campaign, you are going to be frustrated."
5,Good book but not for the average hack and slash gamer,"This is more of a GM style book there are several factors in this that the average player character would not understand or be able to use properly, having your charicter drive a car player, gm rolling to see if the car survives the player driving it plus. People seem to care about if it is fast or pretty. but actual design of a vehicle require a bit of planning. If you buy this buuk you will need to take plenty of notes while you are designing it will make it easieer to use, and if you are like me a calculator to check your math. And You thought that you would never use algebra.Carl"
2,non working ear piece,"although the earphones are comfortable, the sound quality was poor along with only one ear bud putting out sound. i was disappointed overall. not a good purchase for the price."
2,Ok headphones and being retractible is really great,sound quality is O.k. but the standard headphones that came with my mp3 sounded better. I purchased these solely for the retractable cord.They broke in 2 months. And I don't know how either; They just went 'clik' and that was it.However; these are sooo cheap and convenient for me that I will purchase another pair.
4,Scooter's latest,"This cd compilation is a very good release for a band that has been around in the trance/techno scene for a while. Scooter keeps getting better with age, and every cd they release is a bit different from the last, so, there is always a good mix. I would say that any Scooter fan would NOT be disappointed with this cd. A MUST HAVE!!!"
1,Is this the world's worst mincemeat?,"That question is hard to answer with authority, but None Such mincemeat must surely be a contender. Its runny texture, poor flavour and a lingering chemical aftertaste should tell you to avoid this product after one purchase. Yet unfortunately it's now the one you find everywhere on store shelves, a tribute to Borden's marketing power.Do yourself, your family and your guests a favour: order a couple of jars of Cross & Blackwell mincemeat instead."
2,Dad's Favorite Pie,It has been difficult to find old fashioned ingredientsthese days for old family favorites like mincemeat pie.My husband had been requesting a mincemeat pie for ages whenI decided to search it out on the web. The mincement itemscame up without a lot of effort and I appreciated the speedyresponse. The pie was delicious by the way and he loved it!
5,Good but buy the complete season 1 instead,"I am rating this 5 stars just because the MTM show deserves 5 stars. Notice that the sales rank of this start up disk is much lower than the complete box set. Good. I want Fox to release seasons 2+ in their entirety. And hopefully this will help. Just a note to the Fox team who is putting out the MTM dvds..... Include the entire cast on the box. The pictures they use now is making it look like the 'Independent Seventies Woman striking it out on her own' type show which was new at the time but today it's dated. If they include Ted, Lou, Murray, etc. it will appeal to a much wider audience who know and love these characters."
5,Mary Tyler Moore Starter Kit-season one,"I agree with Mark L ""Markle"" in questioning why they would release season 1 again instead of trying this new tactic with releasing season 2. I also have already bought the complete season 1. I LOVE IT. I keep looking for word when season 2 will come out. I am very disappointed in the release of season 1 again. HOWEVER, IF you haven't already bought the complete season 1 I definitely recommend buying this new starter kit of THE BEST OF SEASON 1. The complete season 1 was fantastic so I recommend buying THE BEST OF SEASON 1 if you don't want to buy the complete set of Season 1. The Mary Tyler Moore show is a classic. I am anxiously awaiting the release of season 2."
1,An INSULT to all MTM fans,"Fox must be ashamed to what it did to MTM show. I cannot believe Americans treat this american treasure as rubbish. MTM show deserves a fine release as the previous MTM show Season 1.It's time to not to buy more FOX DVD's until they finally know we are the ones who pay and we are the ones who have the control.Is it so hard to be a FOX Executive member? Please, give me a job. I have some wonderful ideas for a perefect release. Don't you wanna loose money? OK, what about a special limited edition DVD? (As Disney used to do; available only for a limited time)But NO, those executive don't have enough grey cells to think about it.As a foreigner I enjoyed the MTM show and consider it a masterpiece and an American symbol. That's why i don't understand how FOX treats it so bad.Please, all together now for the future release of all seasons.And 'remember, don't buy The best of Season 1. It's a crime"
2,"Some smart observations, but none of the brilliance of his later work","Much as I love love love Discipline and Punish and enjoyed Madness and Civilization, I found this excruciating and tedious. Foucault just bounces all over the place, trying to tie together various observations about space, seeing, family, empiricism and medical reforms with no clear goal or overall project. I loved the strong, accessible style of discipline and punish, but Birth of the Clinic has a really weak, meandering quality to it, maybe because it's one of Foucault's earlier works. Which is not to say that Foucault doesn't make some smart observations in it, he does, but they seem isolated and never really fall into whatever the broader project of this work is meant to be"
5,Love My Mikasa Coffee Server,I love my Mikasa coffee server which I double as a tea server also. I receive many compliments about how elegant it looks. So glad I purchased it.
4,Rebirth Brass Band: Hard-hitting and danceable,"This albums consists of the most danceable New Orleans music I have heard in recent years. While Rebirth Brass Band is no Jelly Roll Morton or Preservation Hall Jazz band, Rebirth does stand apart from the crowd. Perhaps the wildest tune on the album is their version of Michael Jackson's ""Liberian Girl."" Admist introductory shouts, baritone saxophone player John Gilbert belts out steady notes, climaxing with a killer solo about two minutes into the song. What makes the song addictive is the way he rapidly shifts between high and ""deep tooting"" low notes. ""Liberian Girl,"" without any pause, transforms into the title song, ""We Come to Party."" This too is a very danceable tune, as is ""Fire."" However, there are so many intruments playing during ""Fire"" that the music leans towards discord at points. While the above mentioned tunes are the most notable ones, there really are no ""weak"" songs on the album. This album is worth its cost. Recommended."
3,"Good, but not great","I've been a Third Day fan ever since seeing them on the Time tour back in 2000. Wherever You Are is good sonically, but it's not on par with Time or Conspiracy #5. Mark Lee, Tai Anderson, and Brad Avery are as tight as they ever have been, and it's nice to hear them crank it up to 11 occasionally on this cd.Lyrically, I hear too much ""God will take care of you"" themes, which is ok, but it's overdone in this instance. What's missing for me are the themes of boldness in Christ (Never Bow Down, from Time) and our place in this world (Alien, from Conspiracy #5).All in all, though, these guys are a great band, heads and shoulders above the rest in the world of CCM today. This cd is worth having in your collection."
3,Not their best,I was a little disappointed in this Third Day CD. There were a few good songs but not the broad offerings that I have come to expect from them. Not my favorite.
4,Very good album,"This is a very good album. I love their Offerings I album the best, but this one is very good as well. What can I say? I'm a worship leader so I love listening and participating in an offering of worship most of all!"
3,Just OK,"I am a big Third Day fan, and I believe they peaked with their Worship/Come Together/Worship II releases. I felt they went downhill a little with their last release, Wire, and this release continues in that vein.I think the lyrics are inspiring, but the music and melodies are kind of bland. My favorite discs by this band are Time and Come Together because there is variety in the songs on each disc, the lyrics are awesome, and the songs are catchy. With this disc, I find that the songs are just kind of running into another, and it's hard to tell them apart. I don't know, maybe as I listen to it more I'll enjoy it more. But, my first impression is kind of ""blah""."
5,""" Praise & Worship"" doesn't have to be Amy Grant anymore!","For those rock music fans that believe that Christian Praise and Worship music equals Amy Grant or the Statler Brothers, Third Day wants to rock you! Third Day has something to appeal to everyone on their latest effort, ""Wherever You Are"". Many of the new songs would feel at home on secular rock or adult easy-listening radio stations.Third Day continues to offer listeners messages of hope and faith in their new songs. My personal favorite is ""Carry My Cross"" which offers a view of the world from the perspective of Jesus. It is in the vein of ""Worthy Is The Lamb"", and it is the kind of music with a message that Third Day does the best.If you enjoy the rock music of today's bands such as Three Doors Down but you want a positive message of hope and love, I would recommend Third Day. Check out their new CD, and try to catch them on the road at a concert venue near you this year!"
5,Best 3rd Day by far,"If you like anything 3rd day has ever done, or like them in the least, get this album. It is the best by a mile. It's awesome!"
4,"Always good, but...great?","I own almost every Third Day album, and I think they're an outstanding band. The last two albums (""Wherever You Are"" and ""Wire""), however, just don't measure up to their earlier work. They still write hard-hitting, introspective lyrics, and their musical talents are outstanding. The songs just lack a certain passion and freshness that their earlier albums contained. There are some high points, of course, such as ""Cry Out to Jesus"" and ""Keep on Shinin,'"" but the album suffers from an overall sameness that keeps it from really standing out from the crowd.Overall, Third Day fans can never go wrong with a new album. As with all their other albums, this one is solid, both lyrically and musically. Just don't expect it to push any boundaries. It's solid...but also safe."
5,Third Day,I love this. I listen to it on my way to work because it puts me in a great frame of mind!
5,Awesome and a great blessing!!!,"Love it!!! Awesome CD, a great blessing and you will love it too! All their best songs in one CD. Can't beat that! This is the second CD I have brought of Third day already. Great blessing!"
5,filling the gap,My daughter and I both feel that this is their best by far and there's 23 years age difference between us.Mountain of God is wonderful!
1,Not the Nutcracker story you want to tell your kids...,"This is rated PG, but the story is of the Rat King who loves to take children's toys and burn them. When a child cries, he memorializes their tears in posters he lines his halls with to be able to revisit the terror and sadness he causes. We had to turn this off. It is nothing like the trailer leads you to believe. Even the special effects or whatever you want to call it, were not high quality. The major characters were quite flamboyant, in a Hollywood kind of way with the swaying hips of the men and the long fingernails and feminine gait. Not recommended for traditional family viewing pleasure. A big disappointment as we wanted to enjoy the Nutcracker in preparation for the upcoming season."
5,Wish was a little kid again,It was a great movie. I wish I was a kid again. the adventures. I would recommend for children 8 and up :)
1,"Nutcracker, or Natzi-cracker?","HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE! Can you ever find a way to butcher a beloved Christmas classic? I almost bought this piece of garbage movie at the store a while back but DVR-ed it instead. Glad I did. God, Tchaikovsky would be rolling over in his grave! Really? Albert Einstein? Freud? A musical...? They only did like 3 Nutcracker songs anyways!How can this possibly watched by children. The Rat King would horrify any young child. Talk about making them hate this classic. The creators ought to be ashamed of themselves...come on, the Holocaust in the NUTCRACKER?!?!"
1,A Nutcracker's Horror!,"The movie started out magic and beautiful as one should rightly expect. I loved Nathan Lane's character. The the Rat scenes were so horrible and scary, my almost 10 and almost 12 yr olds begged me to turn it off and then had nightmares. Most of the scenes were depressing. It is a wee bit redeeming in the end, but the horror of it all negates any value to this film.Not a film for children and yet not sure why any adult would bother. Don't waste ant precious resources ( time nor $) on this film."
5,Stop being an adult! Be a child!,"I have never posted any review but I have to now. I came here to buy this movie but heard lots of unpleasant voices. Please, parents, let the kids watch this beautiful movie. Please stop posting passive and negative reviews to hurt this fantastic movie. Please be a child, not an adult. Please help your child understand part of the movie, if they don't. My daughter and I enjoyed the movie a great deal and have watched it a couple of times. We decided to buy its DVD. It's a dream movie. It's like, your childhood's fantasy. We want to keep it for the rest of our lives. All characters in it have stunning acting, especially Mary and the Prince.Don't judge it with your prejudice. I was so sad to see those negative reviews from AN ADULT, not A CHILD.Please keep in mind: This movie, was a dream of 20 years for a famous director."
4,pretty good movie,these reviewers have to lighten up. this is 2012. this movie indeed is for kids and adults. its a beautiful movie.very very entertaining movie. so kids keep watching this beautiful movie. thank you
4,A unique version of the Nutcracker,"I think this movie got unfair reviews. Sure if you are looking for classical version of the Nutcracker this is not the film for you. But this modern version is a enjoyable film to watch and the characters are delightful. I like how it focuses on Nutcracker and Mary's fight against the rat king and his mother's evil spell, since I always thought the battle between the nutcracker and the mouse king was too short in the original version."
1,Scarry and disgusting characters w/o plot,"I got the movie for my 3 daughters,(aged 5 to 10) only to discover that they were terrified with the horrible images of rat/person people, running around doing horrible things, destroying things,etc.Except for a few seconds of good Tchaikovsky music, the movie was worthless!! The argument was week, not interesting either, and 2 of my daughters had nightmares a few nights after watching the nonsense, gross movie.Then I fund out there are many other interesting options, including the Nutcracker balle, which I do recomend."
3,Better than expected,"I didn't really mind the ""Nazy theme""The monsters were NOT as scary as some people here make them out to be.Granted, Christmas gets totally lost in this story. But this movie is not as bad as I thought it would be.Very entertaining as a matter fact. My 7 yo. daughter loved it.My 5 yo. watched it and was never really scared of the big bad rats. She didn't love it, but then again what beats barbie when you are a 5yo old little girl?Me and my wife were not impressed but neither disappointed."
2,Boring,"My grand kids had no interest, it wasn't excited enough with magical eye catching to there attention. I wont recommend this movie if you are tired, you will go to sleep."
1,"Save your time, money, and sanity; stay away from this travesty!","The Nutcracker is an absolutely required part of the Christmas season. We've enjoyed Baryshnikov and Kirkland for many years and Balanchine's production is nearly as good. Each year we watch a stage production, sometimes great, sometimes not so.This year we noticed this 'Untold Story' on Netflix and checked it out. Man, are we glad we did not buy it. Other reviewers have used the word horrible enough but the movie is not even that good. What did the writer and producer have to eat that gave them such a nightmare? And why did they then go and make this awful thing?The Nutcracker is a wonderful story but this story should have remained untold."
3,Computer learning System,My child is 14 months and she just loves this learning system. I just wish there were more games to play on this keyboard.
3,Not a keyboard - Beware,"Maybe its my fault for not having read the details but this not a childrens keyboard. Its actually plastic thing that goes on top of your own keyboard and presses its keys. This means that if your child hits it hard, it will transfer force to the keyboard.It also doesnt fit all keyboards so I had to buy an extra keyboard so it would fit. Making this computer learning ""system"", quite expensive.The software is nice though.I havent seen anything better around. Which doesnt mean that this is good but since my kid love to play in the computer, this will do."
3,great idea horrible to set up,"Great idea but horrible to set up. They keys are very difficult to match up and at stage 1 ""cause and effect"" you may as well use your normal keyboard."
3,Ok,"This toy is very educational, however watch out if you have a wireless keyboard like me.... it will not fit!! It fits traditional keyboards, tried and tried adjusting keyboard and everything else, just doesnt fit!! My daughter bangs on the keys and it doesnt do anything cause well it doesnt fit!! The game itself is very educational I reccomend it for a kid about 1 and 1/2!!!"
3,"Ok, but I like the Fisher-Price online games better","My 2 year old got this for Christmas, it took a half hour or so to get it adjusted to my admittedly old and odd shaped keyboard (it kept launching outlook). The software isn't that helpful and truthfully, I (and my son) prefer the Fisher-Price online games better. It's a good idea but needs some refinement."
4,"good content, small print","I'll agree with the previous critque...great content, though the small typeset detracts from the readability"
3,not an expert,"I purchased this encyclopedia to supplement reading I have been doing of the history of America, especially the west. It is a terrific source of bibliography. However, I have found several inconsistencies just from recent readings regarding Lewis and Clark and Kit Carson biographies. Not a huge issue, as I don't take everything I read as 100% truth. Take written history as more of an opinion."
4,Disney and Tetris makes a good game,"The songs in Magical Tetris are good (much better than in the New Tetris for N64). The disney characters are fun. The story book sections are repetitive and kinda break up your momentum, but they can be avoided in some of the game's sections. The tetris part of it meets your skill level...if you are keeping up with it, it will increase the drop speed to challenge you. Overall, it's a fun game."
2,a different take on tetris,"this game is mostly tetris with disney characters inserted, for what reason i'm not quite sure. mickey and crew exist only to market this game to children and make a weak story line just unbearable. tetris doesn't need dressed up with guest stars. but i guess if you really like puzzle game or for some reason disney than there might be some reason for it. all that was added was a few different shapes of tetris pieces."
5,Awesome game!,"Bomberman 64, is a really good game. I rented it about a week ago, And then I got it a few day's later! It has a Great multi-player mode, And the 1-player mode is really fun, too! It's, Got a lot of puzzle's that take a while to Solve. I think it's Really worth the money!"
5,MULTIFEST... BOMBERMON,"HOHOHO MERRY CHRISTMAS, and you better make that wish list quick, or you might not get Bomberman64' The multiplayer is awesome, and the adventure is fun too. If this company keeps this up they'll become the next POKEMON. Who knows, BOMBERMON does have a good ring to it. The multiplayer is the best out there. Only people that have problems with seeing funny graphics, hearing funny music, and being a sweet terrorist (in that game, it's not a violent out-of-country terrorist, but a cute bomber dude...) The men are animated, and there is NO VIOLENCE. It is the best game out there, and if they get HALFLIFE64' I'll steal one, and buy the other. (figure of speech)"
4,It's almost perfect,"Bomberman64 is almost the best game I've ever played, however, it does have its weak spots. The music is particularly memerable, and the stages are well graphiced,challenging,and beatable. But, there is one area which is normal mindstumper. I can't easily get by it. The bosses are also rather hard to defeat,although like the stages, they are defeatable. There're also stages whitch can be defeated, but take a long time to defeat."
4,FUN WITH BOMBERMAN 64,I bought this game for my son about a year ago. He really enjoys it. My nephew comes to visit and I can't get the kids away from this game. It was well worth the money I paid for it.
1,Never ever buy this game!,"Do not buy Bomberman 64. It's sucks! All the levels are too challenging. Of course games are supposed to be hard, but this is crazy hard. How do people like this game?!"
4,"Fun, But Not Perfect","The single player on this game is good. Some of the stages are a little long and eventually get boring, but if you stick with it, you will definately be rewarded. Big, challenging bosses and many secrets keep this game exciting.Multiplayer, on the other hand, gets boring way too fast and gives you little options on how you want your battle to go. Custom suits found in single player help this a little, but I would still give this mode 4 stars, being generous.Though I might not have sounded like it, I really liked this game. It was only my second N64 game and I would never sell it.My main problem with this game is that you cannot jump. I mean, how hard is it to jump, even if you are carrying a few bombs on your back? This can get EXTREMELY FRUSTURATING, though you can jump on bombs, which partailly solves this problem.Note to owners of this game: Watch the movie in the ending credits for solutions on how to journey to some of the game's secret areas."
5,review,everything was shipped properly and in a timely fashion. Good job! Have a good day and let me fill the word requirement
5,"A ""Blast"" From my Past","Bomberman 64 is one of my favorite games of my childhood and in recent years, my game was given away to good will without my consent. I'm not mad about it because it went to a good cause and is going to someone less fortunate than I am.Now, onward to the review. As I said in the beginning, Bomberman 64 is one of my favorite games from my childhood and I am glad to have the actual version of this game back! I've always had a good time playing the game despite it being hard sometimes to say, complete a certain stage or to defeat a certain boss. It's a lot of fun and if you're like me who didn't grow up with the Super Bomberman games on the SNES, then Bomberman 64 is a great substitute!"
4,Basic John Wayne,"The basic B movies of the Golden Screen era. I find them entertaining and enjoy watching the Duke growing as an actor. Of course many people say he was just being himself and not really acting. Not a bad role model then, huh?"
4,I couldn't stop watching,"Everyone should know THIS IS A ""B"" MOVIE through and through, the acting is cheesy and bad, the voices didn't match the movement of the mouths most of the time, and the story was laughable. It looked like my friends made it in a week, but besides all its flaws, I couldn't stop watching. The only reason I liked this movie was probably because I love crappy obscure films but hey the the weird looking dude on the cover actually held my interest for the entire thing, if they had used another less dorky actor I would have turned it off after the first ten minuets."
3,psyclops,this is a three star only some will find some thing that they like and rate four star and some find nothing interesting in it and say two stars. is weird guy get camera i neye formouter space ha ha
2,THE DIRECTOR MUST HAVE HAD ONE EYE AS WELL,"This was one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen;Stupid, but not boring. The camera in Shep's eye had no meaning at all. So , he was obsessed with filming. Big deal. Maybe , if he went around murdering people and positioning their bodies as if they were actors on a screen, this would have provided a link between his obsession before becoming cyclops to his insanity afterwards. The premise would still be ridiculous, but their would be some connection. There was absolutely no romance between any characters. The threat of a star-crossed lover becoming a victim of a lunatic always enhances a movie. The actors were good. The story sucked, but was worth watching."
1,Worst piece of .... ever!!!,"When I rented this in Blockbuster it looked like a real DVD. What happened?!?! It looked like it was shot by someone's camcorder. Most of the actors were ok, but what was up with that Shemp guy? Was he trying to be a lumberjack or something?? He looks like the kind of guy that would total two cars in a week."
4,Lots of chili!,"Flaky fish with lots of chili. It's quite hot, so I'm not sure if I could eat it as a ""snack"" as the description suggests. Great for adding flavor to plain vegetables, or adding more heat (and flavor, of course!) to other Thai dishes. I think it could be used like a Thai version of Japanese salmon furikake (over steamed rice) as well.This 8 oz jar is filled to the top! It'll last me at least a year even if I find many uses for it."
3,Italian Cult Gothic Horror,"This somehow odd film from Italian Cult Gothic Horror director Freda (""Dr. Hichcock"") is almost unknown. Made a year after his rough Giallo ""L'Iguana Dalla Lingua di Fuoco"" the title suggests yet another Giallo. But, in fact, this film is not a Giallo at all - but a Gothic horror story about a cursed pearl necklace and a strange Satan's Cult which gets confronted by a hippie quartet on a day out. The story sounds unique.Made on a very low budget, Freda made more than the best out of it and created a strange movie with all the classic Gothic elements, and also boosts a handful of astonishing gore effects that echo the rude sequences of his Giallo a year before.The cast is lead by Camille Keaton of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" fame, while Luigi Pistilli delivers another neat performance as the leader of the strange Cult. The soundtrack is composed by Stelvio Cipriani and is cool as usual. A film worth looking for despite its rarity."
4,ok,Kinda dated - but I guess the paint factory guy shows you most of what to do - the other guy just stands aside.
1,Very Dissappointing. Low Value.,"Based upon the previous reviewers' comments, I was really looking forward to receiving Julian's tape. Unfortunately, the tape is literally an autobiography of Julian's past efforts at audio publishing. It is not presented as a ""how to"" which was precisely what I had been lead to expect. As interesting as Julian's war stories may be, they are not terribly informative to those of us looking for the nuts-and-bolts of audio publishing. The quality of the recording is modest (not bad at all for a do-it yourselfer; however, not studio quality). Save your money and purchase of copy of ""Words on Tape"" instead. Grade: C-/D+."
4,a very interesting artist,"I leave off a ""star"" only because viewing Kentridge's drawings can not substitute the experience of viewing his films. Indeed, looking the charcoal drawings I wonder at what stage of the sequence it is in. Is this the last step in the drawing? Looking at a drawing outside of its time base can also be a positive. I love searching the surface for smudge marks and erased hands and arms. His drawings end up being a record of movement (something that most single drawings fail to capture). For anyone who doesn't know, by the way, Kentridge animates his charcoal drawings using filmic stop motion techniques. The results are amazing. Anyone interested in drawing and painting, the birth of early film, and South African Politics: here is your artist."
2,Knife Edge Review,"Knife Edge is not a good game. All you do is sit on some sort of plane and shoot ships and other such things. At first it kind of gives you a thrill, but as you go on, the game just starts to get so boring. I would not recommend this game."
2,Sitchin is hard to read,"the book itself arrived very quickly, the only plus. Sitchin is really hard to read. subject matter is facinating but way too hard to read."
4,Great Value - Great Selection - Decent Sound and Notes,"This is an unbeatable value. These are truly greatest hits - for example, Louis Armstrong's Potato Head Blues, Ellington's Creole Love Call, Moten Swing, Coleman Hawkins Body and Soul. If you are into this period, you probably have most of these tracks already, but at the price it's worth picking up the odd items you may be missing. If you don't have a big collection of early jazz, this is a great place to start. My only quibble would be that the selection is heavily slanted toward the 30s.There are decent liner notes with at least track and personnel info and recording dates, if not original label info, and each cd has its own sleeve with track listings. The CEDAR sound restoration is pretty good. Certainly better than a lot of budget reissues, but there are probably better masterings on the market for particular tracks (e.g., Proper Box Hot Fives)."
4,"Excellent, thoughtful intro and contribution to the science/religion debate by comitted Christians","An excellent intro to the science/religion debate. It touches on almost every issue in some way and shows how committed Christians who are also scientists are dealing with the ""debate"". This book is a must for any Evangelical Christian who thinks evolution and the other findings of modern science are in direct antithesis to their Christian beliefs. It's also a must for any non-believer who thinks all Christians are ignorant and take what the Bible says in blind faith over the findings of modern science. Not Just Science presents authentic attempts to maintain the integrity of both Christianity and science. I only felt there was one downfall - I would have given the book 5 stars had I not felt that the authors relegated Christianity solely to the realm ethics too often."
2,could of been a lot better,"The size of the toy is ok, after reading other reviews and the size coming from a pornstar i was expecting bigger, but maybe im just to advanced. The squirting part of it does nothing for me, you can barely feel anything actually ""squirting"" inside of you. I still use it but mainly for my webcam shows for facials :)"
2,Disapointed,"Too big around and the squirting action is disappointing. Considering modifying this product to make it more useful. Product is overall well constructed. Delivery was prompt and received in good condition. Reviews did warn a little about the size, but nothing specific. So if 2"" in diameter sounds big, it is."
2,Dissappointing,"Having purchased previous WOW Gospel CD's i assummed this one would be good inspiring music, but at present i do not enjoy the CD. There maybe 1 or 2 tracks that sound ok, but i don't fell like listening to it unfortunately.Dissappointing!Neville"
1,Songs All Soung Alike,"I love gospel and grew up in a foot tapping, hand clapping church but these songs all just sound like yelling and most sound alike. I was very disappointed and am trying to give the CD away so my $ isn't wasted."
5,Great Book for New Linux Users,"I've been looking to try out Linux for years. Most Linux books talk about servers and commands. This book gets right to the things that real people want to do. I loved that the chapters were organized by stuff like Getting Email, Browsing Online, Playing Music, etc. It makes it easy to turn to right what I need to know.The introductions to the chapters are funny and the book never really gets dull. the author looks at the boring system parts like most of us would and helps get through it. I loved this book and am now running fedora core 3."
5,rockabilly with a dash of punk and plenty of blues,kevin gordon's music is like no other. his stage presence alone can move mountains. he and his band -- ya gotta see him LIVE--- will drive you crazy. kevin is the real deal.
5,A must!,"Firstly...if you like rocking country music THIS IS FOR YOU! There really isn't a bad track on this CD. I first came across Kevin Gordon as an opening act and from the first guitar chord to his last song in the set he held his own. Check out my favorite song on the CD ""Evan Pick Up the Line"" This man is for real and he is also a very down to earth person also having met him 1/2 a dozen times at his gigs. Can't wait for his new one!"
4,Pretty good game play.,"When I rented it from blockbuster I was addicted from the start of playing it. It is challenging to defeat on some levels. I learned how to play the game efficently in about a day or two. May of been shorter than that. The graphics were pretty good for a puzzle game. I consider this game slightly better than the original Tetris,maily because of the complexity. Overall, this game is worth buying if you like puzzle games and sorts of that nature."
1,WHAT A MISTAKE!!,"I purchased this product for a Christmas gift. It didn't cost much; but it wasn't worth the trouble. I had my doubts about the product since it arrived with the bottom part unattached so I decided to keep it for myself. I began using the carafe mid-January and within three weeks the feature on the lid which enables the coffee to pour fell apart. By then it was too late to return. The only good thing about this experience is that I hadn't thrown out my old, stained carafe that I purchased over 25 years ago and still works beautifully. The stains no longer bother me, ha! ha!p.s. To Amazon, this product does not meet the quality standards that I have come to appreciate when shopping in your store. This product should have -Stars."
1,trouble before first use,"Previous to buying this model, I had another Copco model that Amazon no longer sells, and it was great - until it took a tumble. This model must vary widely in how its made to have such a wide range in reviews. Frankly, this is right up there with the worst products I've ever come across. Before I used it the first time, I simply rinsed it out, by hand. Afterward, it was obvious that some of the soapy rinse water was caught inside the carafe. So I took it apart to clean and dry it and put it back together. That became an ongoing, daily chore, right up until I realized it was leaking through the outside, as well. That's when I threw it out, maybe 5 days after I received it. This is one of those rare products I'd rate in negative stars if it was an option."
1,poor quality,"I have had this product befor, but these 2 that I just purchased are of the poorest quality that I have ever seen. I will never purchase this again, and do not reccommend that anybody else purchase them"
1,don't bother,"You get what you pay for. If you want something cheap that looks nice, the lid doesn't fit right and the bottom lets soapy water in around the glass liner, this is for you. If you want something you don't have to struggle to get the lid to screw on or that will last more than a month or two, don't bother."
1,Defective,"I've bought three of these in the last few months, attracted by the low price. One broke within about three months of use; when I replaced it with another, the second broke within two days of use. On each occasion, the glass liner shattered. These were purchased for my mother, who is largely bedridden and needs something to keep liquid cool near her bedside most of the time. Between those two purchases, I bought another for our housekeeper, who wanted one for herself. My guess is that the glass liner is inherently fragile, not supported well on the interior, suffers from poor quality control in production, or some combination of those factors. The third one has not yet broken, but that one gets very little use."
1,Hot but leaky,I had been looking for a white coffee carafe for some time and finally decided on the Copco because it had good reviews and an exceptional price. The coffee stays hot for several hours (a nice plus) but the housing leaks like a sieve! I'm disappointed but will have to replace this one again soon... and it certainly won't be a Copco.
1,Came with parts missing,"Mine came without the glass inside. I can see by someone else's review that they had the same problem. It was just the plastic outside and when you put liquid in it, since you assume it has the inside, it leaks all over. Amazon promptly refunded my money. Do not buy from these people. They do not check their product before shipping it out."
2,tealover,"The top on this carafe is not easily removed, especially for older folks with arthritic fingers. I also have a Corning Thermique which is very simple to unscrew to refill."
1,Carafe Do Not Buy,"We used this Carafe for the first time this weekend. It was horrible. The bottom linked hot scalding coffee. We even undid the bottom from the top and realigned it since this was where the coffee was coming from thinking it was not tightly screwed. Even with the bottom and top aligned tightly, it still leaked hot scalding coffee! Since this was a gift that was opened and not used till now, I could not send it back. I was very disappointed since this was a birthday present for my 96 year old cousin. I would not recommend anyone buying this product unless you like your hand scalded with coffee.Copco Simplify Carafe"
4,Extended Warranty for your GPS,A small cost for the additional peace of mind and protection for any electronic equipment. This comprehensive warranty is worth the money if you should need it. If you bought your GPS through the internet this is usually the only real option to ensure that you have additional warranty coverage for GPS. Other plans are available with different coverage periods.
1,Laughable,"We've always used Black and Decker toaster ovens, but when our last one died, I decided to give this product a try. The quality is laughable. It has a cheap tinny feel, the shelf does not slide smoothly, the crumb tray removes awkwardly, the baking tray is made of some thin grayish metal, and much more. Frankly, the entire unit has the look and feel of a science project. Every now and then we purchase a product so bad as to be downright entertaining, and this was one of those times. It's now back in its box awaiting transport to UPS, and I'm ordering a Black and Decker."
5,The pictured oven exceeds 400 degrees,"One reviewer commented the oven does not reach the desired 450 degrees for frozen pizzas but enlarging the furnished pictures shows the temperature dial can be set to 450 and further, increased by setting dial to broil which is more than sufficient for a pizza. The machine's versatility and price make it a bargain. A great little appliance."
3,Good Value,"This is a good basic toaster oven. It does not have enough wire rack adjustment slots, only one. It does a pretty good job of toasting bread. However it seems to take a longer amount of time than usual to bake or reheat something on the oven setting, even on 450 degrees. Overall it is a good basic toaster value for $29.00 just don't expect too much. It does get fairly hot on the exterior. It is large enough to fit a 12"" pizza (like Tostinos). The metal tray is somewhat flimsy and lightweight. It has a bell that dings when done timing and the oven shuts off too."
5,Fantastic for Two,"I.got this so I would not have to use our full size oven for the small dishes I make for two. It is the best! It cooks evenly and accurately. It is large enough for a 10"" dish. Be sure to get the toaster oven cookbook by Lois Dewitt because the recipes are excellent and this oven can handle all the dishes she recommends. It is so much more than a toaster oven, but it toasts great, too. The look on the counter is clean and there is plenty of room to store the mini pans inside. One of the best kitchen purchases I have ever made!"
2,Not so great Pizza Oven,"I am completely upset with this purchase. It was defective when it came to my house. I have another oven that is 5+ years older and it works much better. I know amazon can do much better than this oven. However, there are other purchases I made at amazon, and I could not be any happier!"
3,I Was Disappointed,"This CD is from on-air recordings. The interviews are awkward and of little substance. The music doesn't have the zip and energy I've heard in other recordings of Muggsy and Turk.Had I known, I wouldn't have bought this CD."
5,I thought I was the only one.,"Bomberman hero is a bit too easy for a sequel to the bomberman hero 64 but, it is more fun than the first one. Although the multi player option is gone, the story is better and bomberman has the ability to throw bombs and jump. Not like the first one he could only place bombs and run. If you thought this game is too easy, try beating the bosses in time to get a perfect score of 5, I bet it will take you like 10-15 tries to do it. Don't buy this game if you are a multi player fanatic."
5,Bomberman Bomberman,"This is an awesome platformer with my favorite game character. Great set of moves, interesting enemies, and entertaining levels. If you have a N64 you should pick this up for sure."
3,Another Mario? Do we really need anymore?,"Bomberman Hero is a whole lot more fun than the first one, that's for sure. It's a platformer mixed with an adventure game. Like previous BM games, your main weapons are bombs, and you can increase their fire power and quantity that can be thrown by getting items. There isn't a really good history behind the series, so there isn't anything to say about that. The game plays less like any bomberman game I know of and more like Banjo Kazzoie Mario etc. The story is very similar to any game, save a queen, (boy this gets old) Overall, this is a pretty good game, but experiment with a few others before you buy it."
2,What Were They Thinking?!,"There is No Worse Bomberman, than Bomberman Hero!Gaulke Graphics, stupid story Line....Not to mention: HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF THE REGULAR BOMBERMAN TITLES!!!! It has some Interesting Ideas, but nothing pans out on this game. This game just isn't fun.Please Reconsider before you buy this!"
3,SAD!,"One word describes this game. SAD! This is just a desperate attempt by nintendo to somehow get a few more dollars from this exausted topic. Even though, bomberman is good, this game is horrible. Besides being in 3d it lacks the depth of other bomberman games. It is clear that nintendo did not work to hard on this. I would discourage anyone from buying this unless you want to go home in TEARS!"
1,would be better if I got da right product I ask for.,"can say much good things about this product, cause I never got it. First I got the wrong one. I did send it back, but the right one was never sent to Me."
3,average release from an above average emcee,"I am really disappointed with this release from Kool G. This is a very boring and forgettable release. The beats are bland and boring, the lyrics lack energy as if Kool G was just reading them from a paper, and the lyrical content is weak. Kool G is talking about guns and drugs as usual but manages to sound extremely uninspired with his delivery. Scarface talks about the same topics and his last album is way better than this one.I listened to this extremely short release a few times and I found very little replay value in it. The album doesn't suck, but it is not the best either."
3,Eternity For Women By Calvin Klein,"It smell ok. not bad, I could deal with it. Its not something that I would purchase again. No recommendation."
1,"Good, funny info...but expected a book","The book is more of a collection of quotes, jokes than anything. I was looking for a tool that would ease the transition into the dept. While I know a sense of humor helps, this book was a let-down. It was funny though."
2,Silly Little Book,"I don't know what you are expecting when you buy this book but know that it is not written in narrative form. Every page has a little humorous slogan or proverb pertaining to police work (Example- on one page the entire text will read- A good cop never gets cold, never goes hungry and never leaves work late). The most words that appear on any page is about 20.It's just a bunch of little, silly slogans..Good gag gift for a newbie graduating the academy."
1,Doesn't work Well,"I purchase 4 of these because I kept loosing my Crown Clicker around the house. These are just cheap boxes that I can't get to work right. They were only .99 and I figured that they would work. DON""T Buy. I just took the wrist band off and threw the clicker away."
2,difrrent image and easy broken,"I received diffrent items with image shown for selling. It's easy broken one of 3 items. If you want to buy it, maybe but many, many of same items for preventing of them broken."
1,"cheap, cheap, cheap","Got some of these from a supplier, they are the cheap petco kind. They do not work at all. I am a trainer, and was stuck with them for a year, threw them away. buy sit stay for a basic box clicker."
1,Poor Kindle Formatting,"I purchased this book as I am a fan of Lewis' poetry. Having searched for ""C.S. Lewis poetry"" in Kindle's books, I came across this (and this alone). Intrigued by the book and the price, I purchased it. Unfortunately, there are spacing issues throughout, such as ""See! the shaggy pelt doth growOn his twisted..."" etc. I cannot find a page which does not have these spacing/formatting issues and they are quite annoying. Look elsewhere."
4,emerald doll,these dolls are very nice but they are small. irwin and bandi are diffent coppanies both make small dolls. the emerald doll is 1997 but the other dolls are 1995 the frist dolls made but they are not that rare. there are other links for the dolls
5,Great!,I should bought this book before my semester.I highly recommend this book to the people that study Historical books in Bible.
2,Unimpressed,"I was not the least bit impressed with this product. The first time I tried it, it was seemed to vanish within a couple hours, and barely put any color on my lower lashes. It never really lengthened or thickened my lashes. The scond time I tried it, it took about three coats to get the mascara to even color my lower lashes. I did get longer upper lashes as a result of putting a lot of it on, and while it did not clump, all it took was a little eye watering to make me resemble a raccoon.I'll stick to the cheap waterproof stuff."
2,Irritating to my eyes,"I bought this mascara because I initially thought it was eco-friendly (but it has parabens) and although it was my first ""natural"" mascara to try, it is also the first to irritate my eyes. I do wear contacts but I have never had a mascara irritate my eyes before (I've always used drugstore brands). I gave it 2 stars because it did last all day without any residual mascara under my eyes and it only started to irritate around the 8 hour mark."
4,Pretty good mascara. No clumps! (B+ Grade),"Ecco Bella is a pretty good mascara. It doesn't clump and I was quite surprised by the end of a long day, it didn't give me racoon eyes or smear. What else can I say? Take a chance on this makeup product.Katiebabs"
4,pretty good,"I am a fan of brown mascara as it makes my eyes look more natural so I was quite excited about this product. It arrived in the most practical tube with flat sides to prevent rolling and best of all a mirror on the side of the container. BRILLIANT! The brush, however was a bit weak. The color which appeared light in the tube was a nice shade when applied. Although it looked good the mascara did not thicken or lenghthen as well as others I have used. Overall though I was pleased and would purchase this product again."
3,Dissapointed,"I love this companies other products, but I am not a fan of this mascara.Something in this product reacts badly with me and makes my eyes turn red and water! I was very disappointed because I figured a ""natural"" mascara would be easier on the eyes and I typically do not have this problem with other brands."
2,Mixed feelings about this one,"I received this mascara in brown, and I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, it didn't flake one bit, which is wonderful. I have a allergies and tend to rub my eyes, and it stayed on beautifully. On the other hand, it didn't do what I expect a mascara to do. It didn't thicken my lashes at all. It lengthened them a little bit, but they still look very thin. If you're looking for a natural look, or maybe you're a blonde who just wants some color to make your blonde lashes show up better, this would be okay.Footnote: After another full day of wearing this mascara, I'd like to up my rating to 3 stars, but the site's not letting me. I'll just put it into words. This mascara's staying power makes up for its lack of thickening. It simply does not flake! Maybe it's just fresher than other mascaras I've used, but it I don't think that's it. No brand new mascara I've ever worn is this flake-resistant."
3,So-so,"This is an OK mascara, but not as good as some others that are similar in price.First, the good: I love the little mirror built into the side of the tube. That's a great feature. I also like the color - dark brown, not too light or fake looking. I have dark hair and eyes, and it looked as good as black.The not so good: I didn't think it went on as smoothly as other mascaras. It caused my lashes to stick together, and I had to use a lash brush to separate them so they didn't look clumpy. I tried applying it out of the bottle and wiping off the brush first, but either way it didn't separate well as it went on. However, once I used the lash brush, it ended up looking very nice and natural, sort of feathery (no clumps). It also wasn't entirely smudge-proof, although the smudging was pretty minimal.Overall I probably would not purchase this mascara, since I know of other brands at the same price that go on much more smoothly and don't require using a lash brush."
4,works beautifully,This product was reviewed by my wife who found the mascara to accenther eyelashes beautifully. It is not irritative and comes off neatly and cleanly. It is all that can be expected from an excellent mascara.
5,Love it!!!,"I love this mascara! First of all, there's a big plus before even opening it! It has a mirror on the side of the tube! This mascara also went on very smoothly, and looks nice and natural; it's a nice shade of brown for a blonde person. It has nice staying power, washes off easily, and my eyelashes are soft and smooth to the touch with it on, rather than scratchy. Honestly it's the best mascara I've tried in ages!"
1,Racoon eyes,"Reading the previous reviews, I was looking forward to using this product; as a redhead I need a true brown mascara. The mascara itself is a true brown, however within hours of application all the mascara flaked off my lashes and ended up under my eyes. I didn't realize until I got home from work that I'd been walking around with racoon eyes all afternoon. I do not recommend this, I had the same problems with the Just For Redheads products."
2,Not great,I wanted to try brown mascara and didn't want to splash out on an expensive brand. However this is one of those runny ones that doesn't build volume. Also it tends to get onto your upper (and lower) lids before it dries if you blink. I will go for l'oreal again next time.
3,not so natural,"I just wish I would have read a little more reviews before I bought it. I searched for ""organic mascara"" and this came up. The ingredients contain methylparaben and polyparaben. So I'll use it for a month then I'll toss it and do a more thorough search next time."
2,doesn't stick to the lash,I like that this is a natural product and the color is good. It seems like it never dries and smears easily. The mirror on the product is a nice addition.
1,Complete waste of money!!!,"This was a complete waste of money!!!! Somehow this mascara made my lashes look worse than they do in their natural state. It does nothing to improve or enhance your eyelashes. I'm all for being eco-friendly and buying ""green"" products. However, I still expect them to serve their purpose and this did not. And, while it did not leave me with ""racoon"" eyes as another reviewer mentioned, it did leave brown smears beneath my lower lashes by the end of the day. Would never buy this product again and would not recommend it to a friend."
5,Less-chemical mascara,"Excellent brown-tone mascara, sweet applicator brush, and fewer worries about chemicals, carcinogens, endocrine disruptors and other toxins so common in so many cosmetics. Color is light enough for my redheaded daughter (Spring, by Four Seasons) and yet dark enough for me (graying Winter).I found this product via the 'Skin Deep' cosmetics database, an awesome resource!"
4,"Good Points, bad points below","ECCO BELLAFLOWER COLORMascara--Review:Good Points-I have been using it a few times a week for 2 months and it hasn't driedout at all.In fact it's as juicy as the first day. It doesn't clump at all. Goes onsmoothly and looks great with a light brown or pink eye shadow.Perfect for day ware-Great for on the go- I just throw it in my purse and, because of themirror on the side, am able to apply it anywhere. The mirror is theprefect size...just large and wide enough to see both eyes as you apply,but not big enough to change the small convenient size of the mascarabottle itself.Bad Points-I would suggest it for the very conservative woman.You have to use several layers in order to get a semi thick effect."
3,Don't get wrong i love this game but!!!!!! it has a miss!!!,"This game is not for everyone some people get weary by the 3rd stage , i like this game it can get a little repetitive but thats ok! even if the graphics is better than on PC, it never really got me going it has miss.I prefered Doom64 however this game still has it challanges and lots of demons to kill the sound effects are creeepy, this game is definitely worth a try Laterzzzz gamers."
1,quake,"I rented this game thinking that it would be really cool. Unfournately, I was kinda dissapointed. The graphics are like a pc shoot 'em up that had come out in 1995...If you want a good shoot em ups, don't get this one..."
1,"A very, very, very bad game.","First of all I'd like to start with the dark nature of this game. When first played I thought it was cool. And it is...in the beggining. Then it gets exteremely demonic. One level is called ""Satan's Dark Delight."" This was a very bad thing for me since I am a Chistian an HATE the Devil more than ANYTHING! This game's graphics are terrible and pathetic. If you wan't a game like this get Quake2, which is not demonic in the least.In summary this game well [stinks]. Don't get it. Get Quake2."
3,The Successor to DOOM Isn't a Great Success,"Quake is a DOOM-like game from the makers of DOOM that attempts to claim the throne of DOOM as best first-person shooter, but falls short. The graphics are nice, but aren't very detailed or varied, and the enemy design isn't very good. The soundtrack is pretty subtle, and isn't all that great, and the sound effects are only okay, but aside from all of those things, it's a nice blast-a-thon with some interesting levels and weapons. Give it a try if you enjoy DOOM or Duke Nukem. That's my two cents."
3,"PASSABLE, BUT MEDIOCRE 6 OUT OF 10","I really tried to enjoy Quake a lot, but unfortunately it gets too repetitive and boring, and it tries to rip off Doom and Resident Evil. The enemies feel really quite stupid and uninteresting unlike the enemies in Doom and Resident Evil and they are just annoying and pesty. Your weapons are kinda cool, but they feel dull most of the time and not very satisfying when slaughtering hordes of enemies. The 3-D graphics are just awful to look at, and have no where near the finesse of the graphics of Doom. Some parts of the game manage to salvage some of the disappointments that linger in it. Unfortunately, this game is marred by boredom and repetition which really kill its chances of being a classic."
3,THE DIE IS CAST WELL,"DIE has an interesting premise, borrowing somewhat from the SAW franchise but attempting to offer a more ""redemptive"" slant. I had a little trouble in following some of the plot's complexities especially regarding Jacob's conflictual nice guy/cold hearted killer persona. DIE has a dark, almost surrealistic feel although its slow pacing can be frustrating.The cast does a decent job especially the reliable Elias Koteas as the tormented cop and John Pyper-Ferguson whose non-chalant wickedness is quietly chilling.Unlike SAW, DIE eschews excessive gore or protracted extensive scenes of violence. DIE could've been a refreshing change of pace from standard torture flicks, but it's lack of dramatic cohesion and a weak pacing keeps it from truly transcending its genre."
4,Movie was brand new,The movie was brand new. No scrathes or scrapes. However the movie itself could have been better. I did not like the ending. But i did like the torture.
4,"Organizing the South Bronx, by Jim Rooney","I recall reding this book about 4 years ago. My recollection is that Rooney did a good job of explaining how he came to study education in the Bronx and discovered Industrial Area Foundation organizing in the South Bronx around the issues of better public education and affordable housing in particular. I thought he did a good job of gaining valuable access to the organization, its leaders and organizers. His interviews and insights were very interesting. I must admit being of a fan of this kind of Faith-based organizing myself having seen it be effective in Chicago as it has been in Rooney's description of the Bronx. Faith-based plus other institutions can democratically improve neighborhoods and revitalize citizen democracy in all types of neighborhoods from the Bronx to Westchester County."
2,"Rooney adores SBC, but he doesn't analyze its work.","I was disappointed in this book, but I think many people might still find it well worth reading. Rooney tells the story of South Bronx Churches, an Industrial Areas Foundation affiliate, which came to organize in the Bronx, with the primary purpose of building affordable, single-family homes on some of the Bronx's famous open land.Unfortunately, Rooney doesn't critically examine anything the SBC people say to him. He presents their opinion, and their own descriptions of their strategies and their results, as fact. It would be more interesting if he were able to evaluate what the group accomplished in comparison to other groups, or in comparison to the goals they set for themselves.But if one recognizes this fault, one can read much of the history of this significant Bronx organization in these pages.And I have to say this -- either the author or the publisher should have used a spell-checker on this book."
1,movie is supposed to scare and fry your nerves but its only annoying and pretty sad,"The movie is about an ordinary family consisting of a Mother, Father, Son, a Young Daughter and an Older Daughter whose worlds turn upside down as 3 dangerous men led by Muse Watson (I Know and Still Know What You Did Last Summer), who break into their house and terrorize them all. The Oldest Daughter and Young Daughter hide in the house away from the men who are beating and torturing the other family members. The Oldest takes matters into her own hands when the Younger Daughter gets kidnapped and she stands up for herself against the evil men. Sometimes almost effective but doenst add up to nothing but sillyness and badly staged situations and acting. This ""Horror"" movie doesnt scare nor fry your nerves, it just gets annoying after awhile when you watch it. Pretty sad if you ask me. Watson is unbelievably corny as the led thug."
4,Great Until The Last 15 Minutes,"This movie was SO awesome. It was extremely suspenseful, scary, and had plenty of good scares ( although some of the scenes were a tad bit unbelievable). I was ready for a great all around movie, when It just began ... in the end. It is rather Unfortunate, because on the whole, the movie was great. Buy it, it's great, and don't ket the pile of ... that is the last 15 minutes dim your spirits. :)"
4,I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW TO RATE IT,I WAS SO FREAKED OUT BY THIS MOVIE THAT JUST SAW IT THROUGHT FAST FOWARDING IT. iT WAS very SCARY
2,RING-A-DING-A-LING,"Hel-lo!...a telephone in the bedroom and she doesn't even use it? And this is supposed to be a smart person. Oh, silly me, I guess you wouldn't have a movie if she would've used the telephone in the bedroom to call for help. This movie certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat, but it's difficult to be fully engaged when you keep asking yourself why she didn't use the princess phone featured in the first scene."
3,Makes a statement,"This is a pretty watch but, even after checking the size, it was still larger than I expected. I would wear this as a clunky fun watch, out with friends, but it doesn't work as a dressy office watch."
5,Solid Christian fiction with great plot,"A Dangerous Silence by Catherine Palmer is a multilayered book with lots of great plots. Marah Morgan returns home to the family farm to help care for her ailing father and try to repair their relationship. Judd Hunter shows up looking for work at the same time an archaelogical team arrives looking for the remnants of a Native American village on the property. Palmer does an excellent job of slowly feeding the reader just enough information to keep them hooked. The several different plots play out slowly until they start to weave together in a fascinating and frightening way. Sometimes Palmer goes a little overboard on Marah's conversations about faith with Judd: they don't always ring true. When everyone's motives become clear, there is a need to suspend disbelief, but the characters are interesting enough to make it worth the while. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more of her works."
4,A Great Book!,"Don't let the religious overtones scare you away. Christian beliefs are only discussed on a few pages and does not dominate the story. A Dangerous Silence is a surprisingly wonderful read, with great characters, an exciting plot, with danger, mystery and a little romance. I'm not a religious person, but I enjoyed the book immensely and would recommend it to anyone."
1,bad product,"Karaoke should offer instrumental, without voiceover, yet though the settings are there, the DVD does not turn the vocals off when that option is set in the menu. The product is defective and so is Vol 4 which was purchased with it. Because of this, we'd be better off singing along with the Broadway soundtrack which has far better vocals."
5,I liked it. What can I say.,"I thought the movie was great. I knew going into the movie that it was made with a low budget. I also knew that the martial arts in the movie is the real ""thing"". These are real martial artists doing what they do best, intense martial arts action. I looked up the lead actor D. Al. Jackson. As it turns out this guy has a few dojos in Florida and has been practicing martial arts for decades. He's the real deal for sure. I'm sure that the director had to slow down the film to catch his action. Honestly, he moves too fast to capture everything. If there was a category of the most leathal man per per pound, or per height I'd have to give it to this guy. He invented the whirling tiger style of kung fu.If you can appreciate ""real"" martial arts (more so than the storyline) then the DVD is worth it.That's pretty much what I think about the movie. Buy it, watch it.. then go on.."
1,Even If It Was the Last Movie on Earth,"This is the worst movie ever. I bought this movie thinking what the hell could be so bad about it. Well everything, the acting is so poor. Trust me the only way you should buy this thing is if you are trying to prove to someone that there isn't a movie in existence that is worse. After making it, the producers and directors must have just had it sent out. There is no way that they could have actually watched it and still have it put on the shelves. It should be banned."
5,Gift,"This product was a gift, and the recipient is raving about the glove. He is an excellent cook/chef and is very happy with the product and its function."
2,A bit light,"I guess I was expecting a whole lot more, considering Jeanne Moreau and Marcello Mastroianni were the stars of the film. I actually didn't make it through the whole film. I got bored, because nothing seemed to happen throughout the movie."
2,- for the DVD transfer.,"5 stars for the film. This 2001 transfer (the only one available, since Fox-Lorber holds exclusive rights) is scandalously bad. Not only is the image blurry and shaky, but it has not been adjusted for 16 x 9 TVs. This means the picture is a small rectangle surrounded by black in the middle of your HD TV. Note to Fox-Lorber: If you are not going to treat your films with basic respect, license them to Criterion. Their ""L'Eclisse"" from the same year shows how it should be done."
3,Masterful film ~ Terrible DVD transfer!,"I viewed L'avventura, then this, then L'Eclisse, and I have to say that Criterion did a bang up restoration and digital transfer on the former and latter. The issue is that for some reason, Criterion does not have the rights to this film. So I had to check this version out at my library. The transfer and restoration (or lack of) are terrible. The film is so dark at times that you can't really see what is going on! There are sound issues, there are loads of dust and noise... It's like they didn't even care! It reminds me of a cheap bargain bin DVD...I hope that Criterion will soon be able to release a restored version of this film so that this brilliant feature receives the treatment it deserves!Five stars for the film!One star for the DVD!"
4,Very Engaging Vintage Horse Story,"(from the jacket flap)When first the three Irishmen, Shawn Flynn, Jo, his brother, and their friend, Pat, spied the great gray stallion galloping across the moor in the thick mist they felt deep within them that there was something fey about the beautiful horse.The very fact that Old Moira, the village character, seemed to know its history so well, this, too, was significant somehow. However, Shawn, having acquired Mig for his own-Shawn is a horse trainer in the States-finds the great horse is pining away. It is not until fourteen-year-old Danny O'Hara, a boy who fears horses, gives his whole devotion to Mig and rides him, first fearfully, then with confidence, that the stallion again comes to life.Now what of the race in which Danny's father forbids him to ride? And what of the stable fire? And last of all, what of Mig? There is a powerful story here and with it just a touch of fantasy which will hold all young horse lovers spellbound."
4,mig opinion,I read it when I was a pre-teen and thought it was very good. Not worth $160 though. I might pay $20 for it as a gift for my grandchild.
3,"Good, but could be better","The pockets on this organizer hold regular sized paper (8.5 x 11) okay. If you want to use folders, you'll have to cut them down quite a bit. The picture shows what appear to be folders in the pockets, so you'd think regular pocket folders would fit, but they don't. The description says the pockets are 9"" wide x 8.5"" tall. They got the height right, but the width of 9"" is including the stitching/seams, so they will not accomodate papers/folders over 8.5"" wide. Also, several of the seams on the pockets began to come apart at the top after about a month. This is a useful organizer, but the pockets need to be wider."
1,too small.,"I was very excited when i found a pocket chart with enough slots for all 17 students in my preschool class but was very disappointed when it came. I bought it as a place for my students to put their take home folders everyday. Do not be fooled by the picture, folders can not fit in the pockets... I am very disappointed and will be sending it back."
1,I never received the game,I never received the game at all! Very dissappointed!!!! Money wasted! Will never order from an outside vender again! D. Stidham
1,Wetrix is all wet!,"I love tetris and other puzzle type games, but I really didn't like Wetrix at all. You take game pieces and try to build ""lakes"" that will not let water escape from your board. That doesn't seem too unusual, but they way the board is angled and how it shifts around makes it very difficult to set the pieces down...not to mention making you seasick! If you want a good tetris game for the N64, spend your money on the New Tetris, or Disney's Magical Tetris Challenge."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Visual Basic is absolutely the wrong language to write CGI applications. The overhead required will drag your server down to a crawl.That said, the book itself is fairly well written with lots of useful information. If you are a CGI programmer in general (C, Delphi or PowerBASIC) then there is some really useful information here. Particularly if you are a PowerBASIC programmer, since PowerBASIC can compile stand-alone executables to just a few 'k-bytes'."
2,Not worth the money.,"The problem with this title is its proprietary language. Depending on the server you program for, why would you want to use the Authors version of the interface software. It's well written but lacks being practical."
3,I have some reservations with this portfolio,"This portfolio is well made with good stitching and lining. The retractable handles are a great feature for going from small handled case to underarm portfolio. It also has a good number of pockets with options within for storage. But, the portfolio is not made of high quality leather as advertised. My sample literally stinks. It has a smell of cheap plastic. I would go as far as to say that the only areas of leather are the bottom panel and the handle. The other areas appear to be made of plastic like leather. If they are indeed leather they are not of high quality. I will use it until it wears out or I can justify replacing it with something more expensive. It's a shame b/c the portfolio is nicely made and very functional."
4,"Well built, looks good, fits my needs","Not much else to say... it's well built, the zippers are well constructed and move smoothly, and it looks good!"
2,Enough Already,"Branden has written many books and they all say basically the same thing: live rationally and consciously. That's it. If you've read one, you've read them all."
2,This is getting old ...,"I guess I don't see the point of this book. Branden's whole ""self-esteem"" theory is pretty basic if you ask me. Self-esteem is how you experience yourself, so if you want to feel better, start living your life better. Point taken. The tricky part is how to go about doing that. There is little practical advice in this book, it basically amounts to, ""Ask yourself, what would John Galt do?"" Which is basically what's he's been saying for a while now. There's nothing new here, and if you need a Branden book, get Six Pillars of Self Esteem."
1,save your money,If you feel like wasting your money buy a set of these they are complete junk i put a set of these dorman control arms on a 2000 maxima and they didnt last but 2 months they must use the softest cheapest rubber imaginable for the bushings
3,Third-Party Guidedown,"Sometimes, when I look at these strategy guides, they often don't have enough of the feeling into each of the levels, that there not shown in full focus within a map. That comes with Prima, and their strategy guide for Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3, for the Game Boy Advance. The unfortunate disadvantage with this game guide, is that the maps really aren't detailed enough to showcase pitfalls, puzzles and problems to pass the time by. Another disadvantage is that if you have an earlier guide that Nintendo made, whether it was the very first Super Mario 3 guide from the 80's for the original NES game system, or the guide that reflects with the Super NES collection, Super Mario All-Stars than this really isn't a suggested purchase for the Mushroom Kingdom. I really suggest you get the one Nintendo made for Super Mario 3 for the Game Boy Advance, instead of this one. The maps are much more detailed there."
4,Not Bad at all!,"This PLAYBOY Video is for fans of PLAYBOYS CYBER GIRLS....If you like the Cyber girls then you would also like this video...Amy Miller,Natasha Bernasek & Stephanie Heinrich,Erika Michelle Barre,Shiloh McCormick Get LOTS of camera time.....I was very pleased with the video.....& im sure you will be to..."
4,The Bad Times,"The book Survival In The Storm is about a 12 year old girl named Grace Edwards.Grace learns to battle the hard times like The Great Depression ,the horrible sand and very poorness.Grace writes in her journal almost every day,she writes about every thing that happens in her day.Grace has afriend named helen,helen and Grace go to there favorite plac all the time when Helen's over.This is a great book!"
5,The best Dear America book ever!!,"Survival in the Storm was the best Dear America book I have ever read. I like it so much that I've read it three times! It tells about twelve-year-old Grace Edwards, who lives on a Texas farm during the Dust Bowl. It's sad when Grace's friend Helen moves to California, and when Ruth's (Grace's seven-year-old sister) best friend dies of dust pneumonia. But there are joyful parts too, like when Sadie, a girl who was always mean to Grace and Helen, becomes friends with them when she moves to California (she wrote Grace a letter and apologized, and she was in the same migrant camp as Helen.) I recommend this book to kids and adults."
3,Mediocre and average.,"""Lend me a tenor"" is the second play I've read by playwright Ken Ludwig, the first being ""Moon Over Buffalo."" I've concluded that Ludwig's plays are best performed, rather than just read. He includes much action and physical stage direction that cannot be fully appreciated when being read in bed or while sitting on the sofa. A lot of it is silent acting, with movement and facial expressions. The beginning was very witty and funny (reminding me of Neil Simon), but as the play read on, it became drawn out and overdone. After the mistaken identities and confusion, I expected the ending to be a ""big bang,"" but after the climax, it lost steam. But, maybe when seen on the stage, it is fine. For it's readability factor, I ""sorta"" recommend."
4,AMAZING!,"I'm performing in Lend Me a Tenor this fall. I will be playing Maria, Tito Merelli's wife. The show is amazing. It is very funny to read and to be involved in. You must see show. Find it somewhere near you and go see it."
5,Highly recommended,We bought this for our daughter when for her 1st birthday. She loved it and she still loves it. She is not 19 months old and it is one of her favorite toys. We have not had any problems with it at all. Of course the battery ran down because she plays with it so much but other than that it has been worth the money. We would highly recommend this item for anyone who is interested in buying it. We do want to add that we have many friends who had purchased this chair for their children who also love it.
3,Fun under supervision.,"I bought this item for my 12 month old twin daughters. They love it, but I've found it to be very likely to tip. They've tumbled over a few times trying to crawl onto the seat. The songs are good and the premise is terrific, it just needs to be built a little sturdier."
1,This item has been recalled,"My kids loved this when they were little, but I just read it has been recalled! It is dangerous and unstable."
5,Pricing out of Line!!!,"A few years ago, I purchased this chair for a friend's one year old after seeing how much my own granddaughter loved it. I paid approximately $40 for the chair. Today, I went online to see where I could purchase another as a gift for an upcoming first birthday and almost fell off my chair when I saw what this company is charging for that same chair - $160.00. It is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen and you have to be crazy to spend that much for it. It's plastic, not gold!! What a rip. Obviously, I won't be purchasing this as a gift anytime soon."
3,Tough read,I am not the brightest light bulb in the box and this book was a tough read for me as well as holding my attention. To others it may be exceptional but it did not move me.
1,Experiential,"Roger's hermenutic is highly questionable. His messages are anecdotal rather than scriptural. If one is going to write a book for pastors, they had better take what the bible says about being a pastor seriously. It is clear Roger does not. He admits to many mistakes in his book, mistakes people will make, but these things disqualify him as a pastor. If he took GOD's word seriously, and loved his congregation, family, and most of all GOD, he would of voluntarily stepped down. Shamefully, if you read this book it will become clear to you that he doesn't take GOD's word seriously. Don't waste your money on this book."
3,You'll need strong hands!,"I bought this for my grown daughter who loves to BBQ. She had been looking for a double-spatula for gripping and flipping items on the grill. This looked like a perfect solution. But it was built for large, strong hands, and she isn't able to use it at all. The quality probably deserves 4 or 5 stars, but the designers definitely didn't have women in mind with this utensil."
2,NOT for delicate grilling,"I had been looking for a set of tongs like this for a while now. My parents used to have a set like this, with a spatula on one side and the tong on the other, and it gave the griller far more control over flipping cooking items. One of the great things about it was that it could handle a wide variety of foods, from your standard burger patties to smaller items like vegetables.This set, however, gives zero control over those smaller items. They are only good for large, flat items. The main problem is that the tong portion, for whatever reason, doesn't extend to the end of the spatula. So forget about picking asparagus up. I also don't like the large angle at which the spatula and the tong come together. I'd prefer if they came together flatter than they do.Anyway, I haven't been able to find my parents' tongs, so this is the best I'm going to do for now. I'm just not happy with them."
4,Grill tongs,My fiancee had a similar product that was falling apart and wanted to try to find another one. This was all I could find in my search. I think it's awesome and replaces several grilling implements. He thought it was too much fluff......:p
5,Love this!,"This is wonderful! It is very heavy duty, comes with a clear plastic reusable cover for the spatula/cutting side. It made flipping burgers and brats much easier! This is large & very well constructed, I do not think it would work well for smaller items unless you just want to use it as a spatula and not use the gripping portion. I would definitely recommend this!!!"
2,Back where I started. Not exactly what I bargained for.,"I bought this book as a gift for my brother who was looking for information on finding a new agent in the U.S and abroad, how to approach agents, how to find quality agents, information about affiliations, training/try-out camps etc. Unfortunately this book offers no information in that department. Instead it assumes you are being recruited from a college team, which is of little use to semi-professional athletes, or those who are well out of college.If you're looking for semi-interesting anecdotes and examples of the business end of sports, check this book out of the libarary and give it a read. If you want specific or practical info to get you started or point you in the right direction this is not the book for you."
3,a great attempt at anthroplogical literature,trying to bridge the gap betwwen art and anthropolgy she has done a fine job of presenting her work and making it easy to understand for a moron like myself.
1,Not Tuscany By Aramis,"I made the mistake of not opening the cologne and checking it thoroughly immediately upon receipt. I waited until I ran my current bottle dry and then opened one of these (I ordered three bottles since its impossible to find anymore). It is not Tuscany...it is a knockoff. I opened the other two boxes and they are same knockoffs. Its not even close to the same product...the cologne is a fluorescent green instead of Tuscany amber color, the bottles have a cheap, off-center label, and the liquid inside burns if applied to the skin.I missed the A-Z guaranteed deadline by a week. Caveat Emptor. I will never buy cologne again via Amazon or one of its sellers."
2,**BEWARE** This is NOT the ORIGINAL Tuscany,"#1 I should have read the reviews more closely and paid better attention to the dates of the reviews. There was a post on August 4, 2012 from another individual who purchased the product and he stated what I found out much later ($62 later).#2 This is not the same product. From it's green color (vice golden) to it's fragrance, this is a different formula. The product is similar but different, and it pretty much evaporates within a couple of hours. It sort of reminds me of a knock-off?#3 Way to expensive at a total cost of $62. Don't get me wrong, I eagerly spent the money thinking I would get the product which I had been searching for a long time.#4 NO RETURNS on fragrances!#5 Would not purchase again."
1,could be the Worst Trek Book I've read,"I have read almost every TOS, TNG and DS9 book ever written. This one may very well be the worst of them all. The plot line never grabs you. Several of the characters (especially Sisko)are portrayed way out of their normal character. It's portrayed as tale of the Dominion War and the war is just a backdrop. It also assumes from the beginning that you clearly remember some specific events from one of the episodes of the show itset rather than having a prologue that presents/refreshed those events as a baseline."
2,Disappointing sequel to a great episode,"One of the best episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was ""In the Pale Moonlight,"" in which Sisko and Garak plot to fool the Romulans into thinking they need to enter the Dominion War in order to defend themselves. In the process, several people die, and Sisko has those deaths on his conscience afterwards. In this book, he comes to Earth and confesses to his superiors, who shrug it off, much to his shock and eventual dismay. He has to cope with that as well as handling Garak's reactions to the freewheeling life on Earth and to a former Starfleet officer turned peace activist. The latter's motivations appear significant but are never explored in detail, and the conclusion is rather unsatisfying. I was a little disappointed with the book, hoping for something more worthy of its prequel."
3,Fair Star Trek,"I love Star Trek. I also love the episode that this story spun off of. Unfortunately, this book wasn't as good as it could have been. Garak was one of my favorite characters and the interaction between him and Sisko was always amazing. I think that great interaction was lost here. The story was interesting, but the author lost the characters' personalities somewhere along the way."
4,"A cute manga, confusing!","After years of reading the ""backwards"" English releases of various manga books, I found myself confused here - I was reading the book in its proper order (front to back, like a Western book) but reading the panels in standard manga format (right to left). After about six pages I realized what I'd been doing wrong and went back to start over. A cute story drawn in what I always think is a more old-fashioned, less stylized way. Looking forward to more Dramacon!"
4,Snow in April,"I loved this book, as I have the other 4 Pilcher books that I have read. Pilcher takes you into her world, and you feel the vulnerability, the joy, pain, and everything in between of her characters in this book. Her descriptions of the countryside are superb."
4,Snow in April,"As usual, a very good and nice book, this author always is an enjoyable read, you usually have a smile on your face at the end."
4,"Fun, but.........","When I first got my N64, I got this game, along with Star Fox (Which is an amazing game I might add) and Mario Cart. At first, I hated it. The levels were insane to me. Now, I have got to be a better gamer, and I like this game. I still think it's hard, and if you're a novice gamer, I can't recommend this game. If you're looking for a nice challenge, try out this game. By the way, the graphics, especially the death scenes, are amazing."
5,Excellence in the making,"This is a great game for any who enjoy sitting down and getting involed in an interactive futuristic adventure that blends dinosaurs, mechanical baddies, puzzle solving skill, and of coarse a arsenal of high-tech weaponry to grease them all. It's so easy to get into it's unbelievable. The music and sound pulls you right into it."
3,Could've been better,"Turok: Dinosaur Hunter was the first corridor shooter that I played for the Nintendo 64 and I thought it was a good game but it could've been a lot better. The graphics, control, sound, and gameplay were great. I was impressed by everything in the game except for the fact that it was impossibly hard. Turok also could've had a multiplayer option to make it much better.Overall, Turok was good for Nintendo's first corridor shooter for the Nintendo 64. I wouldn't recommend buying this game, but it is alright to rent. If you want a great corridor shooter, get Goldeneye 007. It has everything that this game doesn't."
2,Not so exciting,"Super Mario 64 kept me going for at least a week, but this couldn't keep my interest after an hour of playing. Perhaps it's better if you stick with it for longer, but I think a game should be fun in the beginning too."
3,Nice sayings but...,"This book has lovely sayings in it for a wedding, but nothing you couldn't find online. I didn't pay much for the book (when I bought it 3 or 4 years ago), so I'm not mad. I plan weddings par time and have used some of the phrases to help my brides and groom out. All in all, it's just ok."
1,Ugh!,"Why waste any more words? (I was forced to give it one star, otherwise the review wouldn't post - but believe me, even giving it one star is over-rating it.)"
4,Panasonic ES8162S / Norelco eveluation,It took about a week for my face to adjust to the shaving head. At present it far outpreforms my Norelco floating head shaver.If it were a bit quiter I'd give it a 5.
5,Best Electric Saver,"Excellent shaver. The best I have ever used. Far better than the latest Braun 360. Even better than the Gillete Fusion razor. It takes longer to shave but no cuts and after a week or two no irritation in the neck area.Other than the nano-particles (what ever those do) and the cleaning base, this is the exact same shaver sold at Brookstone for $249.00."
2,Stick with the Old One,"There is a reason this product has a list price of 229 and can be bought for 139. It isn't good. Mine has lasted a total of 6 months before becoming plagued with issues and problems. Also, the convex cutting system will probably NOT catch on. It isn't superior to Panasonic's old system at all and seems to be more problem plagued. I bought a Pro Curve Linear Pivot. Much cheaper at 80 bucks and let me still you...it doesn't look as nice and feels a bit cheaper but it operates much better and actually gives a better shave. I really really hope Panasonic is planning on phasing the old shavers out and replacing them all with these ""well-intentioned"" but faulty and disappointing convex systems. Also, the one piece design of the shaver foil isn't great either. I had a previous Panasonic with this design and it also disappointed."
4,Neat Shaver,Bought it a month back. Quite happy wih it so far. The good thing is you don't need some fancy liquid to clean it. However a few tiny patches of stubble do get left uncut. I take care of them with the trimmer.
3,o.k.,o.k. product -- make my device a little on the heavy side -- doens't offer as much convinence as I thought it would; wish it had something to cover my sd card -- that's what I really wanted since I already lost one.
1,cell phone cover,The item was too flimzy to use...I did receive my money back...the vendor was very helpful
5,just love the words of kyran daisy so much!!,for any person in this world loving poetry I justrecommend this great author Kyran Daisy. I received the bookas a present and I must say read it many times.It's about time a musiccomposer will pick up the words for making a great song!
3,SINATRA DESERVES MORE,"It covers his life all right, but for music lovers and true fans of FRANK this is not enough. Not a word on NELSON RIDDLE,BILLY MAY and GORDON JENKINS with whom he alterned between 1953 and 1961 on his famous CAPITOL recordings.I learned much more about him reading DEREK JEWELL's biography.What i like best from that video is the funny trailer about PAL JOEY in which FRANK gives a lecture about JOEY. You also see him as BILLY BIGELOW a film he was supposed to do but he simply walked out of the set of CAROUSEL.This documentary covers its subject a little too fast and another hour would have been necessary to tell the whole story well."
5,Just when you think you have it figured out . . . .,"To borrow the theme from the book's tag line:Jake Riley keeps you guessing.Jake Riley keeps you reading.I agree with the other reviewers - this book is exciting, fast paced and the characters are involving. But I want to mention the complexity of the plot.Rebecca Davis has woven a mystery that focuses on 'whoishe' instead of 'whodunit' and the resulting story stays one step ahead of the reader. When you aren't trying to figure out who Jake really is (or following the other character's attempts to figure him out), you're immersed in the dynamic daily life of Lainey - a young teen's life that has something everyone can relate to.Overall it's a great read for all ages."
2,Kinda weak,"This is pretty much just a warm-up for Slum Village vol. 2. Overall pretty weak, other than maybe 3 hot tracks that are remastered on vol. 2. Mostly just short beat samples and live or poorly recorded tracks. Just stick with vol. 2 and pass this one by."
4,Yeah Yeah Yeah !!!,This was a cd never put out to the public due to bad premo.. It is ashamed because the cd is a classic.. During the area when two powerful forces were still alive (Pac and B.I.G.) Slum Village were deeply in the back scenes making hip hop from the essence... R.I.P. forever Jay Dilla... You are a Classic Forever...!!!!!!
1,A good way to kill $10,the first 2 episodes of 24. WHOOHOO! WHO CARES! the season set is just $ 30 on amazon so buy that! They did this with buffy too.
1,The 10 Bucks Back Coupon Is Expired. Just Buy The Complete First Season!,"Yes, 24 is a great television show but why buy this starter set that only has one episode from the first season when you can buy the complete first season DVD boxset and get this eipisode and all the rest of the season one episodes? And don't give me any crud about it being worth it because you get 10 dollars back with the included coupon because that ten bucks back deal has long expired! Only people who like to waste money would buy this!"
4,THIS LITTER BOX IS HUGE!!!,"The litter box is more than adequate size for our two maine coon cats. They kick alot (or so it seems that's what they do) and the litter stays in the box. The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 is because you have to remove the cover vs. lift it back. I suppose, given its size, that may be too much too expect. Otherwise, great product."
3,OR NOT TO BURN,"I've read CD's THE MARRIAGE BED, THE HOLDING and the surprising TELL ME LIES and enjoyed all three of these original stories. Needless to say I ordered TO BURN immediately. First of all let me clear up a misunderstanding on the part of one of the other reviewers. Wulfred did not kill Melania's father. She specifically asks that question and his answer is a definite NO. That said, I was disappointed in the book. Was it the time period? Was it the plot? I'm not sure. If you are a Dain fan, I would probably pick this one up used. Is it a keeper? Again, if you are a Dain fan you will probably put it on the shelf with her other books, but I would almost bet you don't read it again. If you haven't read CD's earlier books, start with them. You won't be disappointed."
1,All I liked about this book was the cover,"Apart from that, there is not much to recommend it.The heroine is supposed to be smart, brave etc, but I found her simply stupid, rude, childish, simply awful! All the time the heroes are fighting. She always called him horrible things, oaf (oh, but he took is as an endearment!), coward (no man in that time would take it easily!), and I don't know what else. It was just... Whatever. And she was supposed to 'love' him. Yeah rihgt. Love him and treat him like dirt. And he allowed her. Did he have no spine?? I don't know what he saw in her. She might be beautiful, but it just wouldn't be enough with a character like that. And the 'ordeal' in the end of the story was just plain stupid. His wound healed in four days? Yeah, right. And in the last pages of the book they speak about adultery. Yeah, that's real love folks!If you have to read this book, just borrow it from a library. It is just to bad to spend any money on it."
2,Apparently etiquette is not for Enlisted,I wonder why this etiquette book only refers to Officers and their activities and social functions. It actually sort of makes me feel like the Enlisted arent important enough to mention and no one expects them to have manners and social grace.
4,Essential for the professional military officer,"This book was standard issue from The Academy. The reason for this...it helps add polish to the professional military officer, which can make the difference between promotion and non-promotion for otherwise equally qualified people. And you never know that you won't be invited to the White House in this business. An essential reference for the professional officer."
2,Thin and messy!,"I purchased this in Gold Get 'Em at the drug store, but the polish was very thin and runny. It was difficult to apply as it was so runny it clumped up along my cuticles. I had to apply several thin coats to build up the color. Though the color was pretty, I don't know if it was worth the mess and time."
4,"Nice color, but isn't the exact match even though the maker and color are the same.","The Revlon polish is fine, but the Pine Freeze color I had from a while ago was a nicer color. A bit disappointed in the color, but it certainly beats what they are offering to nowadays."
5,Too Bad Revlon Discontinued this Shade,"This is my favorite shade--too bad Revlon discontinued it. Haven't found one comparable in any other brand. I bought three--when they're gone, they're gone."
4,Very Good DVD Release,"I've been looking for a decent transfer of THE BATTLE OF EL ALAMEIN and finally found this DVD. The colors are beautiful and there is hardly a scratch or hole in the print to be seen. The audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, a bit flat but completely clear. Finally, the film is presented in the original 2.35:1 letterbox format and NOT in 1.33:1 full screen.Not only does it contain EL ALAMEIN, but also contains the 1951 MGM picture GO FOR BROKE! starring Van Johnson. It looks and sounds pretty good, but not as good as EL ALAMEIN did. Both films contain a 6-chapter search feature.Both films are excellent and this is definitely worth buying."
1,Uninspiring,"I got this because it promised blu-ray surround sound in an immersive field. Well it is surround sound.It is not immersive, it's pretty uninspired, and the music sucks. It's electro disco music accompanied by some OK images of fantastic paintings/illustrations. No problem with them, except they are as cliched as the music.I would not even give this away to somebody else."
1,Can somebody listen?,"I tried listen at Playstation 3, at my desktop and at Samsung blu ray player. No sucess. I have 32 BD discs e this is only with problems."
1,THE WAY TO PARADISE,"As for the BD ""The way to paradise,"" I got broken in half due to the fragile package that was sent. He was anxious to hear him, and unfortunately does not run.As for ""Chris Botti"" to date not received. I am arranging to return the database to paradise The way to see if I get another or the removal of the product with the return of the purchase price, including shipping.Luiz OtavioBrazil"
1,Horrible,I ignored comments about compatibility problems with Samsung Blueray players thinking my model was likely new enough and up-to-date enough to play the disc. Well sort of... Every single track contains portions that hang my Blueray player. I have to manually skip forward up to a minute in order to resume listening. For this reason I'm returning the disc to Amazon for credit.On the content of the disc I have to call BS on all the great reviews. I listen to a lot of electronic music and this is really some of the most boring and banal I've heard in recent memory.For $30 + shipping I expected a whole lot more. Sorry - one star only.
1,copy disc(not original) with very very bad quality,"i just receive the product,and was a big disappointment.it is a copy disc(not original) with very very bad quality(stop in different tracks)I have been loyal to amazon customer for years now,and this one was a big disappointment.returning the products i will get 50%only and i have to pay for the shipment.i think this product is a big rip off to the customers.i did not expect amazon to sell copy disks(not original) for the price you pay"
3,Only for true JEAPORDY lovers,"Until WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE came on, Jeapordy was my favorite game show. I used to get Final Jeapordy answers right on the show, but I only got one $100 question right on this adapted version.They said this game is great for the whole family. It would be great for a family who scored the highest possible number on their SAT. I mean, how could a child know old Chuck Berry was when he wrote his 8th song? Another ""feature"" of this game is that you can choose a charactor to represent you in the Jeapordy booth. These people look like cut-outs from a magazine or paper dolls. On the plus side, the sound is amzing, from ""Welcome to JEAPORDY! "" to ""Ooooooh...I'm sorry: you lost with -$999999.67."", you'll be pleased that they did something right. The main menu is also well laid out, but that doesn't help much. So if you can outsmart Socretes, buy this, but if you want better game show fun, buy Jeapordy! on Playstation."
3,It's aight!,"I love Jeopardy games and this SNES version is just like the rest ;) I like the fact that you can choose who you play and it actually shows the contestants, unlike the recent Playstation versions.A nice little diversion to play occasionally with friends, but nothing to get addicted to.Recommended."
4,Jeapardy-No Violence? No Problem!,Jeopardy for N64 was not too bad. The players look really bad and the game takes a little long 30-45 minutes(longer with 3 people). The questions are challenging and a parson who has never played before can beat a parson who has because of a diverse database. You can also select your difficulty and wether the CPU can help you spell correctly. The N64 cartridege is very durable. You need to try to break it to make it bust. And as for education? It's jeopardy!
1,Not in French,This is in the French Language section but does not clearly indicate it is not a French language book. If I wanted an English book I would not be in the French section. Get it right.
3,"Some interesting material, but a lot of it is explained","What is unexplainable about a bunch of weirdos in California sucking each others blood and talking about their strange sexuality? How about Vlad the impaler? The whole vampire thing is totally explainable, and it even mentions that in the film.The poltergiests segment is pretty decent, but nothing as good as unsolved mysteries, IMO.The extreme sacrifice footage is once again, in my opinion, an explainable phenomenon.The spnotaneous combustion segment is the best of the series, and provides a lot of footage and accounts, interviews, etc.So as the title of my review states, the footage in this set is interesting, but the title slitghly decieving, as a lot of the phenomenon is very explainable. However, still a reasonably enjoyable watch. I would rent if possible."
2,Should have been a lot better,"I bought this DVD Set 3 years ago and I was disappointed by it. In my opinion only 2 episodes are good, ""Poltergeist"" and ""Human Combustion"", the other two are not really good. My question is: Who decided to put these 4 shows together ?? The Unexplained was a very interesting show back in the late 90's and the 4 episodes featured on this DVD Set are not even in the Top 10 of the best episodes in the history of the show ! Where is the episode about Alien Abductions ? Or the episode about Civil War Ghosts, or the one about Psychics Detectives, or Secret Societies ??This set is a waste of time and money. Buy the Unsolved Mysteries DVDs instead."
4,Useful reference,"Ventetia Murray obviously does her research before writing! Her book is full of useful information for those folks who write Regency period fiction, presented in an entertaining and interesting style of writing that keeps the reader involved. Great for reference and just plain fun to read."
3,Digital Recorder review,"Very good product, so far, I've had no bad experiences with the recorder. Long battery life"
1,"When you order VN4100PC, they ship VN4100","Another warning to readers, Tiger Direct will ship you a VN4100 when you order a VN4100PC from this page."
1,I have never seen a such a poor recorder,I bought it 1 month agoof course this can record very long timebut that is allrecording quality is too bad to recordand this recorder is only record the voiceit do not record as a mp3 file or anything else.to listen the recordings I have replay the recorder.How inconvenient this is.So I have to buy anohter thingBut funny thing is only 30$ mp3 player can record the voicemuch better than this poor recorder
2,no interface for transferring the voice data to computer,"There is no interface such as USB to transfter the data to the computer. You have to listen to the voice on the recorder, which is very inconvient."
2,JUNK,I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WOULD BE JUST ANOTHER MADE IN CHINA PIECE OF UNSUABLE JUNK. MY FAULT FOR ORDERING IT.l ARTHUR
2,Very limited pc connect-ability,"The VN-4100pc was given to our not-for-profit. We will find use for it, but it has serious problems.We had hoped to use it for recording oral history interviews by loaning it out to members, some of whom are not technically orientated.1. It will not work with our 64bit Vista computer. The Olympus site says it is not compatible with that OS.2. The software must be installed on every computer that it connects to (i.e. no drag and drop transfer.)3. Its best mode is 4bit/22kHz for a bit rate of 88kbps. (As a comparison, the little $30 Sansa Clip MP3 records voice at 16bit/24kHz or 384 kbps but does not have as good a microphone.)4. We have no Macs, but some of our members might. Its not compatible with Macs.Its internal microphone seems good. Its controls are a big improvement over our older Olympus DS-2.If you intend to use it on more than one computer, this is not a good choice."
3,"OK, could be better","The product is light-weight and functional. Basically, there are four main folders to pick from, A-D, and within each of these, every recording is sequentially numbered 1 - 100. My one complaint is that you can't continue a recording on, say, B-1 once the Stop Recording button has been hit. You can Pause the recording, but once it's Stopped, the next time you push Record within the B folder, it will register as B-2. ...Doesn't sound like such a big deal, but when you go back to listen to all of folder B, you have to hit PLAY for each numbered file. In other words, I have to hit the PLAY button 14 times to listen to B1- B14. I'm using ""B"" as my to-do list, so one can imagine that I'm always adding to it throughout the day, and listening to it becomes a pain in the neck. This is a pretty basic model, so maybe this issue is handled better in the more upscale models."
1,Not as useful as reviews claim,"This company(Olympus) cheats customers by luring them to believe that VN4100 is the same as VN4100PC.The difference lies in the computer connectivity.This Voice recorder which bears the VN4100 does not have USB Port and thus CANNOT do a file transfer to the computer.So the question of email sending of voice files is impossible.Also, the battery functionality is not good.The moment the hold button is on and the battery is replaced the machine crashes and becomes useless.The design is sleek but it has not substance."
4,There is a video Manual for Olympus 4100PC,"My problem with this recorder or any other voice recorder is that I couldn't remember how to perform some of the functions, and what buttons I am supposed to push to move files, etc. But there is now a video manual showing all the functions (broken into chapters) for Olympus 4100PC on www.HandBookLive.com under Electronics. I tried a similar Panasonic model but couldn't figure out the written manual, so I managed to password protect myself and not being able to reset it (ended up returning it back to Fry's). We made a HandBookLive video on Olympus 4100PC recorder so that others wouldn't struggle. Hope this helps!"
4,Digital Voice Recorder VN-4100,"I have been using dvrs since they came into production. I use them every day as reminder, shopping list, to do list, etc. I've loved all of my recorders except one and I forget what that one was. My last Olympus recorder was my all-time favorite, the DW-90, out of production. This latest Olympus VN-4100 works well for my use. None on the market at the time of purchase fit my aesthetics criteria, but the VN-4100 was the least ugly with the features I needed and a reasonable price tag. I've used it about 2 months now and I'm happy with its functionality."
3,Complicated for non technical people,I was surprised to find out how difficult it was to set up the various parts of the recorder. I found the instructions difficult to understand. The voice replay is not as clear as I thought it would be for a digital product. Still it comes in handy when I need to remember something that I need to do. I will say that I like the fact that the recorder is small enough to carry in my shirt pocket or pants.
3,olympus VN4100 Digital Voice Recorder,"This recorder does its job and records unfortunately before buying I researched and could not find the difference between the PC version and this version and thought it was only the software and USB cable. I already owned the 3100PC version and thought for a $10 difference I would not need those tools since I had these already. This version does not have the actual port to insert for the USB cable therefore there is no way to download your recordings. If you need to download go ahead and purchase the PC version after all, if you own a previous version you will now have backup software and an extra USB cable."
2,Wrong Part # on Amazon listing,FYI - if you purchase this product and it comes from Tiger Direct... they dont carry the VN-4100PC. Just the VN-4100. Which means no cable and no way to hook this up to your PC. I had to return the product and TigerDirect told me that Amazon has this listed as the wrong part. They don't offer the PC version. SO... caution when purchasing this item from Amazon.
3,"Good, Pocket-Sized Recorder","This small recorder was exactly what I was looking for. It saves a one of recordings and I'm able to organize them in folders. An external mic plugs in very easily. The only thing I would have like to see added was a USB port or other way to hook up this recorder to my computer. Otherwise, for the money, this digital voice recorder is a home run."
2,horrible audio quality,i bought this item for class to record lectures. upon using i found out the audio quality was very poor. i expected much better and i am upset i bought this item. there is so much static playback is un audiable.
5,Easy To Use,"I probably ordered the VN-4100PC too, but the VN-4100 does what I need it to do, so I have no complaints.This product is very easy to use, durable, and reliable. I had to use 8 of these products to match vehicle license plates for a traffic study and they did exactly as I wanted them to do. Voice clarity is good, even over the loud sounds of cars and trucks passing by."
4,"Satisfied, but be careful when you change batteries","The VN4100 is an excellent handheld digital audio recorder. I'm very satisfied. HOWEVER, when you change out the batteries, be sure the HOLD switch on the left side of the unit is in the HOLD position. I changed out batteries with the HOLD switch in the ON position, and it killed the unit. Still, it suits my needs, so I got another. Just be careful changing batteries."
2,Be careful there is no port for computer cord,"This recorder has no port to connect to the computer for uploading the voice files for saving or transcribing. Be sure to order the Olympus VN-4100PC Digital Voice Recorder if you want that capability. Otherwise, I am sure this is a good little recorder if you don't need the computer upload capability."
3,Good Product but bad decision,"This was a great product for the people who dont have PC. I got disappointed after I saw there is no way we can download the voice to PC. Unless, we use some other mechanism to get that to PC. Not straight from the box. I wish I had seen the specifications earlier before purchasing it."
1,Not as pictured!!!,"Beware! the picture is of a VN-4100PC, but you are getting the cheaper VN-4100. The PC version can download to your computer. If you look closely at the picture you can see that it says ""VN-4100PC right at the bottom of the recorder. Also, the the PC version is silver (as pictured) and the cheaper version is gold (see other reviews)."
3,"Worked Great, Died in 5 Months","I liked this product while it lasted. I used it as a backup to take notes in conferences and training sessions. I am a technical writer and it was an invaluable aid in cross-checking spoken information.However, it conked out in only 5 months. For no good reason as I treated it decently. It lived in a special pocket in my handbag with my mobile phone and was never dropped or anything. I changed the battery and found that the unit was no longer responding to any button and could not be accessed, even though the battery was full and correctly entered. All I have is a message saying ERR on the screen and many hours of precious information LOST.So my appreciation is mitigated. A good product but 5 months is too short a life."
5,Billie Rae Bates has written an excellent book,"From one Dynasty author about another, I think Billie Rae Bates has done an excellent job in presenting Dynasty's facts. I have the e-book version and found it to be sleek, put together quite nicely and a wonderful reference guide for the series. She is to be commended for putting together not only this but her other books and a website to be proud of. I wish her nothing but success in all of her endeavors.Judith A. Moose"
1,WRONG PRODUCT,"I HAD BUY THIS THIS PRODUCT, BEFORE BUT YOU LIE TO ME SAYING ANTONY SANTOS IN CONSERT RELEASE JULY 2006 AND WHEN I SEE THE DVD IS THE SAME CONSERT OF 2004, I SAID FOR GET IT AND I GAVE IT AWAY, BUT I FEEL I WAS ROB BY AMAZON, IS ALL GOOD, I JUST WONT BUY ANYTHING ALSE THRU YOU BECAUSE YOU SAID IS BRAND NEW, AND IS AN OLD VERSION, SO SORRY BUT I DID LOOSE MY MONEY WITH AMAZON, THANK YOU."
2,This book is kind of retarded.,"This book is okay, but it is not really worht buying. There are several people's ""journals,"" but there is only bits and pieces of them. Lucy, the main character, lives at the Seaveiw Apartments, with her divorced mother and her twin brothers. She mostly writes about ducks, a bratty boy who lives at her apartments, poems, her friends, and her substitute teacher. It has a strange, but not exacly surprise ending. I recommend checking this book out at your library, but not to actually spend your money on it."
4,A Lot of Learning in a Little Book!,"Lucy learns some valuable things during the course of this book. She learns that a teacher can be a friend and confidant. She learns that writing about events and her feelings can be a wonderful release. She learns a lot about poetry, because it is her teacher's favorite thing, and he starts each day by writing a poem on the blackboard. The final thing she learns is about being judgemental. Sure, her classmate Andy is obnoxious and irritating. But once she sees why (his abusive stepfather), Lucy learns compassion."
3,solar light,"pretty good light. not as good as other Malibu lights (this one needs more sun), but it works well."
2,Weak light - lasts about 15 minutes,"After sitting in the bright sun all day, the light came on after dark and stayed on for about 15 minutes. I think that the battery must be defective and I'll try a different one before returning the product. If that fixes it, I'll be more or less satisfied."
4,Good product,"I really like the product, but would've preferred to have the entire bin contain only lowercase letters. It makes more sense to me to have each item (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, & numbers) sold separately. That being said, I use them a few times a week with my reading groups!"
5,Bounty Hunter Adventures.,"I have a bounty hunter action figure collection. This was a great addition, even if Chewbacca wasn't a bounty hunter. It looks nothing like Chewbacca in the first place. You can just make up a back ground story of a Bounty Hunter Wookie who joined forces with Boba Fett for a short time. Anything is possible when it comes to your imagination."
3,From www.wargamer.com,"I hear www.wargamer.com will soon have a full review of this title. They also have many other reviews, previews and analysis articles of military history.Ghost Front is a fascinating, if somewhat esoteric, view of the events that led up to the Battle of the Bulge. The intelligence failure of the Allies, or more precise, the pure blindness they suffered from, caused tens of thousands of needless casualties on both sides of the line.Charles Whiting does a good job of portraying information that is not easily found in other sources, but his grammatical style has errors and doesn't flow very well in places, making reading this book less enjoyable than it should be."
3,Behind the scenes,"I liked the book because it gave me a different perspective of the B.o.B. of lots of things going on in the quiet zone, and also reasons why the US Army was so incredibly ignorant of the Germans intent for a counteroffensive.It makes me mad for the first time that Ike and the general staff, highly trained and far from the bullets, would let their guard down and get so many young men killed because they wanted to think the war was all but over, so ignore all the telltale signs of an impending counteroffensive.Although the book lacks a bit in keeping you on the edge of your seat, it was well worth the time to gain the new perspective for me.I recommend it just for that reason, if no other.Thanks for reading."
4,"Great game, but...","This is a great game but it lacks some of the most recent features. You can play exibition mode, season mode, world series mode and home run derby. You can only trade players in season mode. You cannot create your own, but o well. The graphics are good, but the game is old. It features 1998 rosters so it isn't up to date. Try it out, It is pretty cool."
2,Two words: REAL BAD,"This game has to be the WORST baseball game I've ever played. The players look nothing like the real ones, they have a very outdated roster and since you can't trade, except in season mode, so you can't update them. The computer cheats! If it's losing by a point, it will hit a 2 run homer so it can win. Here's another example: If the computer needs a run or needs to get on base it will hit a base hit, and even if its a weak one, your fielders thow very slowly and weakly to you. Stats don't matter in this game, it's the size of that doofy yellow circle that looms in the center of the strikezone. If it's small, the player ..., if it's big, the players good. Want another reason why stats don't matter? I've hit a homerun with John Smoltz and a Grand Slam with David Cone. The graphics ... and your very limited to your gameplay. Don't buy this game, you'll be tired of it in an instant!"
2,Not so hot,"I think it really is cool...NOT...it is ok for a couple seconds, and then you wake up!!!The graphics stink and its so old that you can only trade players in season mode. DONT GET THIS GAME!!"
2,ok i guess,i have stoves in my rentals that are not GE and these drip pans do not fit........they fit about 60% of the time.....a little dissappointing
3,Okay,"This book was intriguing in concept, but it was just a bit over blown for me. There was too much imagery, melancholy and failed? introspection. So, while the book was interesting and enjoyable in its way I had trouble engaging with it. It felt a bit like a thought exercise rather then real people. In essence it is not really my thing, but interesting and I'm sure exactly what some people are looking to read."
1,Kinda Krappy,"I must say --I loved Black wine -- but this book was a big disapointment. I (thankfully) ordered it used from amazon, and when I had read like 40 or 50 pages I found a little slip of paper the size of a gum wrapper that said ""from here on the book sucks - I suggest giving up -D"" I found this rather amusing. Now I have no idea who ""D"" is - but you were right on, girl! But I made it to the end (albeit with some skimming). I found I barely cared about the main charecter and the storyline just plodded along. Lame.I must say to anyone reading this : Buy Black Wine - that book took me a bit to get into it, but then -AMAzing - the tale was layered and gripping, fascinating. I am not at all surprised it won a fantasy award.Pass on this one - or borrow it from the library, maybe."
3,Extreme G - Nintendo 64 Video Game Cartridge,"A somewhat entertaining video game to pull out of your cartridge stack to play and help kill thirty, maybe forty-five minutes with. Out of the twenty Nintendo 64 games that I own, I play this one probably every other month or so. Good graphics to say the least. Also like the music that's played when I put this cartridge in for a race. Sounds very much like that of The Orb or possibly Aphex Twin. Used price for the video game simply cannot be beat."
4,High Quality Racing Game,"I got this game a few years ago when it came out and am writing this review because I enjoyed it lots. There are three dificulty settings to play racing on - then 3 racing circuits. The cool thing about winning the circuits is winning new bikes and codes. The graphics are really good, and the weapons that one can get while racing help slow down other opponents. The multiplayer combat is mediocre, but the 2 player racing is excellent."
3,I'm still not convinced,"I have read this novel twice--once in college because I had to, and then again recently just to see if I had missed something. Fifty positive reviews (and millions more on the way, no doubt) notwithstanding, I fail to see the great appeal. And I am a teacher of literature. It's not funny. It's not ""multi-layered."" It's not a lot of the things that others claim it is. I get the idea that people are afraid to knock something that the whole world seems to love. Well, I'm not. I go along with Nabokov's initial opinion: ""It's a crude and cruel old book."" Unfortunately, the Spanish sense of humor hasn't evolved much in over 400 years--you can watch similar puerile slapstick on Spanish TV any night of the week."
2,very boring game,"This game is very, very boring. I wish I didn't buy this game because it was a waste of room and money......"
5,Wonderful and Insightful,"This wonderful and insightful work by Pierre Englebert is one of the best works out there on the political economy of Africa. His thesis is that Africa's wide range of economic experiences (despite the general malaise) has its roots in the varying levels of historical legitimacy exhibited by African states. He backs this argument up with impressive quantitative data and a qualitative look into how illegitimacy retards growth and development. His most controversial claims come as he questions that sanctity of the state boundaries bestoyed on Africa by colonialism. Brilliant, insightful and accessible!"
5,great book!,I use this book for my English class and i really like how it's structured and the stories that are compiled in it!
3,Over priced and damged during shippment,"For a used book, this one was in very good condition. It was very over priced for a used book of this kind, I only purchased it because it was the only seller that was willing to ship 2 day air. Had I not needed this book for my college class, I would not have gotten it. For what I was charged, they could've spent a little more on shipping it out to me, and they should've put it in a box instead of a flimsy bubble envelope because the cover was damaged in shipping. Again, if I didn't need it right away for class, I would've sent it back."
3,a bit disappointed,Was a bit disappointed to find the cover a bit bent up and looked dirty. The book isn't missing anything but was surprised at the quality.
1,Excellent,I am very pleased with the condition of the purchased book. It arrived in great shape and in a timely manner. Thank you Amazon and Bunches of Books!I give this service 5 stars.
4,Outstanding,Seller was more than just great. Product was in excellent condition. I would buy from them in a heart beat.
4,Gabbing Gals are Great,"When the term folk music is heard--many people are turned off...Well listen to these ladies, you will be overwhelmed and wanting more. I love Debi Smith, Megon McDonough & Sally Fingerett, all of you are wonderful!...But Camille West is a dream. She is a cross between the Smothers Brothers, Christine Lavin, and Weird Al. Her three songs (L.A.F.F., Dyslexic, and The Nervous Wreck of The Edna Fitzgerald) are worth the admision price of the purchasing of this CD--These ladies make the CD a wonderful & zestful suprise who those who don't like FOLK music-Bennet Ponerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
4,Entertaining Read For Metal/Hard Rock Fans,"'Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal' is an entertaining read for anyone that is/was a fan of heavy metal/hard rock from the 70s and 80s. The author paints a very wide picture of the scene and does a TON of research. I liked the book fine but I guess I was hoping for an end result that grabbed me by the shirt and sucked me in but alas that wasn't the case. I learned some new stuff from the book, the main thing being the power that MTV had in the 1980s in marketing and launching these bands to super stardom. I wish the book wasn't so jumpy at points and we had shorter chapter that focused more on the bands 1 at a time, but instead the author takes a timeline approach to the content which is fine.All in all, a +++ read that is worth picking up.**** RECOMMENDED"
3,Good Not Great,"This book does well in going over the birth and run of the 70's and 80's rock scene, but he gives nothing that was not already covered elsewhere. The back of the book kept saying it was like a Behind the music. Well, I think I might have learned more from the Megadeth and Metallica episodes than I did from this. It is good....but not great"
4,Hilarious and informative but not so good ending.,"I got into this book because I thought it would help me better understand what made metal so popular and what changes made it fall. It talked a lot about the bands backgrounds and them arguing and splitting up, and a lot of things that made me bust out laughing. I couldn't wait til the end because I thought he would have began analyzing Metal and what it needs to do to pick back up because today's metal is nothing like it used to be. The book concludes saying something along the lines of Metal fell we don't know why, someone needs to re-spark it....It did talk about MTV and grunge coming along, just nothing from his own perspective on how to re-spark Metal.So when you get into this book just know that it's gonna just tell you about the rise and fall, nothing more.Only leaving me bummed out about old Metal."
3,Great for new comers,"The first time I read this book I loved it. Bang Your Head is a fairly simple but enjoyable book. It gives an overview of many POPULAR metal bands from late 60's to the early 90's. But after reading this book I have done research of my own and found that there are gaping holes of metal knowledge missing.Most of the book is about bands like Black Sabbath, Metallica, and Guns N' Roses. They barely talk about NWOBHM scene and almost completely skip metal legends like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. The book is also very biased towards the authors opinion.I know i made the book sound pretty bad with this review but like the title says it is great for new comers to the metal genre."
2,Very Misleading Title...,"Although some have criticized Ian Christe's book ""Sound of the Beast"" for focusing too heavily on Metallica, at least he made an effort to cover many, if not most, of the bands and genres out there, even if he just paid 30-second lip service to them. This book, by contrast, is mostly the saga of the 80s hair bands that gained popularity on MTV. It would have been fine if it had had a title that suggested that. Instead, it's represented as some sort of exploration of heavy metal generally, which it most definitely is NOT. Contrary to the title, heavy metal never really ""fell"", it just branched into different directions and is still very much alive today, as the plethora of European, if not American, festivals suggests. Bottom line, DON'T buy this book thinking you'll get a comprehensive history of metal. Buy this book only if you want to read gossipy stories about Van Halen and the like. Better yet, skip this book entirely and go buy Motley Crue's ""The Dirt""."
5,And there's a sequel!,"What is it about this book? It seems we read it and then lose it. Rather like Gilead and his medallion. I read it about ten years ago in a local community college library. When I finally had money to spend to buy my own copy I couldn't find it. I was about ready to decide that I had imagined the book. Then I found it in a local used bookstore. And found out there is a sequel! I snapped them up immediately (even though I don't really have the money to spend at the moment but I couldn't risk not being able to find the book like before.) Thank you, Molly and Warren."
3,Chess & Spies,"What more could one ask for to feed your inner nerd than chess, spies, and a good dose of Hindu mysticism? While the authors may have taken some license with all three, they wove them together into an enjoyable, engaging read."
5,A great read - Monks meet Sinanju,"If you like the Destroyer series, you'll like this book. It has nothing to do with the series, but the hero has many of the characteristics of Remo in the Sinanju saga. Chess playing Yin vs Russian spy Yang. Mystery, twisted plots, and more. Great read."
2,Not my cup of tea,Don't watch this if it is the end of the day and you're tired because you'll just fall asleep. I thought it was boring with a lack lustre cast and script. I'd recommend you renting it for $1 at Redbox before purchasing it.
4,From Gangs to God,"I had the pleasure of meeting Pastor Halvorsen years ago in Memphis TN, sowanted to share his story with my fifth and sixth grade students. Theylistened attentatively as I read the book to them."
3,The Fighting Pattons,Somewhat interesting but so many millitary abreviations & acronyms that it was @ times difficult to read
3,Hot to touch,Disappointed the grate got so hot it will burn you or a child. I like the other safety features the heater has.
4,Compact & efficient,I have owned and used the classic ceramic heater for probably 12 years. It is very compact and efficent for adding heat to a room. I bought a second for backup and use in other areas.
2,Not worth the money..,"I paid a premium after reading reviews of this heater lasting 10-20 years for some people, hoping I was paying for better quality. Purchased in 2010, and it died in 2012, out of warranty. I wrote the company asking if they could repair it for less than purchasing a new one, and haven't received any reply.So as far as I am concerned, I should have just purchased a cheaper $20 heater. It probably would have died too in a few years, but why pay more when apparently this product is no better."
3,Great product with control oddities,"This is a great heater that warms up a small room execellently. I was disappointed with the latest version because the company moved the controls from the top of the heater where they were conveniently accessible to the bottom rear where they are more difficult to reach and see. They also went from a simple rocker switch to a knob. It doesn't look like good egronomic engineering to me. I purchased this heater to replace one that was 10 years old where one ceramic failed. Unfortunately, the conpany doesn't sell parts for replacement-- a negative."
1,"Bad heater, would not refund all money","We bought this heater from Amazon [...]We paid $65.34 with shipping $74.65. When we plugged it in the heater ran very rough,sounded as if it were winding up. After about 30 seconds we could smell the motor over heating and starting to smoke. We shut it off, we were sent a call tag and after a month only received $45.04 returned to our credit card. Tru Value claimed there wasn't anything wrong with it! There is no way to fight this. We lost almost $30. My advice?? Forget buying anything from True Value Super Store, especially not something that you can go down to your local hardware store and actually receive good service. And apparently Amazon isn't going to back us up either. Very disappointing! We've done thousands of dollars worth of shopping with Amazon, we will have second thoughts from now on!"
3,OK Heater but Bad Design,"Who would design a heater with controls on the back? This is a nice heater and works well and fast... at least for first use. As with all new heaters, all the oil and crud needs to be burned for for a half hour or so, so using it first in the garage is a good idea to avoid the fumes. But controls all on the back is a terrible design and a major flaw to an otherwise good heater."
5,awesome,"I have used many different makes and types of space heaters over the decades. If you need a workhorse of a heater and can only use 120 volt, I very highly recommend this item. greatly out performs anything I have previously used and appears built to last."
2,to hot to handle,"this heater puts out a amazing amount of heat for it's size, and would be great except that the top of the heater near the front will burn you if you are not careful. this would still be acceptable for my use, but i would be very careful if you have small children or curious pets about. otherwise it is a great heater."
2,Another Brush With God: Further Conversations About Icons [Kindle Edition],The book is good!I don't recommend Kindle version because images are black & white.Another Brush With God: Further Conversations About Icons [Kindle Edition]
1,"Misleading title, at best a beginner's book.","I felt a bit ripped off by this book because it only superficially covers the investor's whose pictures grace the cover. In fact, it's an ambitiously massive survey of conventional finance theory related to picking stocks. However, as a professional investor, I've read everything it covers in better detail elsewhere. As a gift for someone new to investing I'd recommend Browne's Little Book Of Value Investing because it is more accessable and entertaining. For more seasoned readers I'd recommend David Dreman's Contrarian Investment Strategy because it uses numerous empirical studies."
5,Unbiased presentation of evidence,"In this book Professor Damodaran has presented:1) The thought processes that lie behind various investment strategies (i.e. postulates of how the market works)2) Could the strategies have worked (retrospective analysis) and3)Did they work (successes or lack thereof of individual investors and money managers who are out there trying to take advantage of Mr. Market in various ways).Spend the time to understand the basics of valuation and its limitations and you might avoid common mistakes or at least be aware of the risks you are taking. Read this book to ground yourself in reality so you can properly evaluate the get- rich quick schemes that are out there. Prof Damodarans book is an excellent compilation of what you need to know before you start playing with your money.Unfortunately, there are no short cuts to knowledge and wisdom but this comes close."
4,"Fun, good improvements, not for sentimental types","This expansion definatly had some improvements over the original when considering basic gameplay, it also does referance the first storyline and explains what happened to everyone loosely based on how you answer a few questions regarding your path of playing. That being said I didn't much care for the whole soul eating concept... but maybe that was just because it conflicted with the way I like to play, making it more of a henderance than an ""ah cool"" concept. All that being said, definatly worth playing if you liked the original, and I would definatly reccomend this title over the other official expansion."
3,Not As Good As The Other Packs,"I am writing this review for my husband, as he is the player of this game.He told me to say that he has always liked (very much ) the rest of the NeverWinter Nights series. He has about everything from the start.He said they changed some things in this one that made it more difficult to play, also a little boring in spots. Wish I could be a little more specific, but I don't play this one myself.He just said suffice it to say it is quite a bit different than the other packs, and he personally did not care for the changes."
1,Don't waste your money!,"My friends and I play all kinds of games, and we saw this for $20 and decided to continue our NWN2 characters. Wow, what a mistake that was. This game is horrible.. even worst than the original NWN2. The plot is just downright ridiculous, and they put some incredibly annoying things into the group play. For example they infect one of the characters with this annoying disease where you have to consume souls to stay alive. You end up spending the entire game just trying to keep that party member alive. Horrific game. We played it for 2-3 sessions and got so frustrated, we moved on to better things."
3,Over done,"Never winter did such a great job with their design and control of the game until they decided to get fancy, if you can call it that. The new game is a big hassle to play, the cures gets in the way and you spend a large portion of your time dealing with keeping your energy up. I got so fed up with it that I just quit halfway through the game and deleted it from my system. Don't get me wrong, it has a good story line and interesting characters even though I feel it could have been better if the characters from the past game could have been reacquired and their stories continued, it would have been better. You do hear a few references to your old companions but that's about it. I can only hope that once they make the next Never winter they go back to the tried and true game play and get rid of that stupid cures."
3,"high degree of difficulty and frustration outweigh depth, fun","The ""spirit-eater"" aspect to this game makes it ridiculously, rigidly difficult to do anything, get anywhere, without backing yourself into a dire situation you can't escape from, much less function in. Fortunately, online I found a cheat code to turn it off, and then the game became enjoyable. Either I'm a total RPG wimp, or else this game is for a more hardcore type of player."
2,Wheres Bioware when you need them,the spirit energy angle ruined it for me. Would like to have spent more time in the adventure and less time looking for spirit energy.
4,"worth the wait, not worth the hassle","i put this game on pre-order the moment that i heard they were coming out with it. after months of anticipation, it arrived and i immediately installed it, and played it for a few hours. when i loaded it up again, it would not work. after combing through the Atari forums, i was able to discern that the product had some bugs that could be fixed via patch. the automatic updater would not work, so i had to download all of the patches individually, un-install then re-install both the base game and the expansion, and finally was able to play the game normally.having such problems in the beginning put me off, naturally, but the game once working properly was well worth the wait - and it made the hoop jumping only just tolerable enough. a good game nonetheless, and newer versions of the expansion being made today have the patches included. i wish they had worked through the problems before mine shipped."
2,not too happy with it,I was hoping they would fix the camera problems in the expansion pack but they didn't! So you have to deal with the camera swinging all over the place. I didn't really like the whole spirit-eater thing...not enough instruction on how to use it so you just kind of fumble through. The ending battle is so long I wondered if I had somehow gotten into a loop and if I should reload my game. All in all...not very satisfying.
4,"Should be Rashaman Nights, not Neverwinter Nights","Its a LOT harder than any of the previous games, its a good game but I had to switch from normal to easy play to be able to complete it for my cleric, but the game did arrive as scheduled and I have no problems with the shipper/seller."
3,Was a lot more fun when younger.,"As a kid growing up in the 90's this game was one of my favorites, but now when I finally played it again current day I realized how bad the graphics really were.Besides the graphic's everything else is pretty good, and handling feels like cruisen CA also for the N64 system. If your looking for a nice racing game, Id skip thisone, unless that is your a big fan of lamborghini's although the game in it's self isn't that bad, but there are far better games out there for your N64 system that have bettermechanic's and story lines."
5,Rudolf Nureyev and Erik Bruhn: Bell Telephone Hour Performances,"Wonderful as a period piece but most of all provides a rare opportunity to enjoy the artistry of the underappreciated and fabulous Erik Bruhn. Despite the small performance space and lack of camera angles, Erik Bruhn's talent shines through....incomparable upper body movement and exquisite partnering (especially with Carla Fracci). No wonder Nureyev considered him the only person he would want to emulate. The wonderfully corny introductions also take you back in time. Despite the technical limitations of the period, this is a winner."
2,Mystical but meaningless,"In God's Bread the main character drifts in and out of disappointing relationships, and finally meets her soul mate in a mystical musician. She learns to channel positive energy to get a happier attitude. I bought this book thinking it would be like another book by a Roper (got Gayle and Carol mixed up) which I'd read. The OTHER book was a passionate, fascinating story about a friendship between an Amish paraplegic named Jake and an EMT technician named Rose. (I forget the title.) The plot and characters had depth and many aspects to them. It portrayed beautifully the juxtaposition of the two cultures with an evangelical Christian message. God's Bread, however, was flat, floaty, mystical, and meaningless - not inspiring and nothing like the other book."
5,Good watch!,"If you are a Valentino fan you have to get this movie. It is silent, but he so good in it! You'll love the facial expresions."
3,Pretty good..,"There's nothing really wrong with this game, I'm just Not a Big racing game fan. This, game is like Wave Race 64: Really realistic Control's that take a while to get the hang of.. Also, this is the hardest Racing game I've ever played.. So, it may take you a long while to Master. Playing around the other mode's By your self, How ever is pretty fun."
2,Excitebike is dissapointing,this product was very dissapointing. Although the realistic tracks and bikes are cool the steering is almost impossible. If I were you I would not by this product
2,excitebike 64,"If you liked supercross circuit, do not buy this game. The graphics are very good and the game play is smooth, but it is not realistic. If you like arcade type games rather than sims, this is for you."
4,ah pure motor bike bliss!,"remember how cool the original nintendo exite bike was?its all here in its original form.but thats not the cool part.the cool part is theres a whole new way better version too.you can learn all your skills in a tutorial mode.you can build your own tracks from like hundreds[maybe] of different hills,ramps,dips and spins.you can even go to modes where you can play games with your bike like soccer.its easy to get lost for days in these games but the real idea i guess is to beat it on championship mode.its pretty straight forward there.theres a side game where you must scale a very steep and rocky mountainside.one[yes i mean one]mistake and youll see some of the most hideous wrecks in exite bike history!its great fun!"
4,Almost perfect,"This game gets 4 stars from me and could have gotten 5 were it not for some annoying aspects. This is an excellent game and a lot of fun and challenging. It will take your at least a month to beat it, if not longer. You must do the tutorial to succeed. People complaining about difficulty and turns obviously have not done so. As for the annoying things, the joystick can be very unresponsive at times, not doing what you tell it to do, and sometimes doing things you didn't tell it to do! The game also 'cheats' in a way. Whenever you're in first place, it likes to throw some random biker in your way who's not even in the race. Get out of the way, there is a race going on you moron!!! And third, sometimes when you get near the wall, the angle shown to you shows the wall, so you can't see where you are. Other than these things, a pretty darn good game with hours of fun."
4,Excitebike64,"The first time you play Excitebike64, you won't find as fun as you thought it would be. It can get very frusterating at times. Especialy when you are trying to win races in the Season Mode.But don't get me wrong. It is a very fun game. It just takes a little while to get used to everything, like the controls! I hade so much trouble turning, accelerating, ect. But after I tried and tried, I got a little better each time. It is a great game! The sound is a great feature of this game. Its really sound like racing dirtbike! The Exibition Mode is also very fun! race against your friends and see who is the best! The Special Tracks that you can go on in the main menu Are also really fun! if you win certain races in the Season Mode, hidden tracks will appear in Special Tracks. So this is a really fun game! I recomend it to anyone who has a nintendo64! Thanks!"
3,Nice game.,"This isn't the best game I have ever played but it is fun enough. I just like to ride around in the desert all day. There is a bunch of different things you can do on here. Also, you can unlock the old, original Excitebike which is really cool."
1,"pretentious, dull, kinda disgusting","I read about this somewhere and was curious. It was endlessly self-praising, dull,boring, repetitive and silly. I watched about 7 minutes, then got rid of it. We learn nothing except that this photographer got some publicity."
4,Worth the time,"I came across this film and after reviewing the material and comments I thought the film would be worth looking into. After watching the film, I actually enjoyed it, the feminist dyke, dj irene look-a-like, was funny with her sarcasm. As a male who enjoys the body of a women, I certainly did learn a few things from this movie, which made the purchase of the dvd justified."
1,"once you have seen one, you have seen them all","Vaginas, Labias, clitorisis. They are good for two things, making babies and delivering them, but they all look the same to me. This movie was pure junk."
1,Why bother?!,"I had not much of a pre-conceived notion about it.It simpy wasn't arty or erotic, it was just a ""collection"" that left me untouched."
1,ehh,"this was a good quality production, but it was as boring as hell, save your money, and buy the book"
1,Not a very interesting movie.,Kind of believable story RE why he produced this picture book. Could easily be exploitive.... but I lost interest pretty quickly in the meandering choppy editing and storyline.
1,regret buging it,"not what i expected at all.hated the man doing the documentry,and that that was all it was,him talking.i will read others reviews before purchasing from now on."
2,Petals,Caught my attention and wanted to see. What a waist of time & 2bucks. I would not recommend this film.
2,Not a good perchase,Not for me. I was expecting a little too much out of the video. I would not recommend this video. Save your money.
3,What?,My girlfriend suggested we watch this. I think she enjoyed it or at least understood it. As for me? I'm still lost...
1,no good,"This is so dumb, seems like a huge wastrel of time. I would not recommend this to anyone. Too bad i actually paid for this.... sucks...."
1,one star or zero star,one star or zero star. Not really worth the time or effort to look at. Not really worth the time or effort to look at.
5,Must see! Inspiring and educational,"Nick Karras' book Petals is now a must have in a sex education feild (so says my therapist), as well as for women who want to better appreciate their vulva. This DVD includes Karras' journey of how he got into publishing this book, the reaction of the public, but more importantly, it is filled with really good educational material. The Indian woman in the movie teaches about different Vulva types...it is amazing! Of course, Betty Dodson is ever so inspiring and charming in this video, too. I started appreciating my vulva with the book Petals, and now, I have much deeper understanding and appreciation of my vulva, for its uniqueness and beauty. This DVD is a must see!!"
5,My sweet spot,this movie was magic.Made me feel so beautiful.I think now my husband will be allowed to examine my pedals.I think it would be of help to my teenagers and all women.
3,Louisiana take on Christmas music,I bought this for a friend and was pleasantly surprised as I am not a big fan of the artist. It's a refreshing change from traditional Christmas carols. Recommended
5,best xmas album of all time,"Aptly titled, ""Soulful Christmas,"" there is no more soulful musical experience than listening to Aaron Neville's voice. Without exception, every song on this album is a pure gem... and listening to his rendition of ""Holy Night"" is literally a peak experience. It is the most beautiful version of the most beautiful xmas song ever."
1,i feel robbed,i ordered soulful christmas by aaron neville what i recieved was a 3 cd set by everyone but aaron neville. not at all what i ordered. very dissappointed. even the reviews were about him and his voice not about all these people on my cd
4,very good selection of songs,aarons style of singing perfect for these songs. i love please come home for christmas. a must have neville cd.
5,ninja wolves,A good old school kungfu movie that would be great for martial arts collectors. very entertaining with plenty of action.....
3,Some nice ideas but a very lukewarm implementation,"Mars Daybreak is not a bad anime. It has some very interesting ideas, including underwater pirates and forbidden technology on Mars. The problem is the execution. The show has no real tension so no action sequence or life threatening situation feels genuine. The objectives and treasures of the show don't seem all that important or valuable. The plot twists are all in the ""meh"" category. The villains and other opponents don't seem all that dangerous and the romances real and potential all feel tepid. When you add the fact that several characters feel unnecessary and that the potentially interesting backgrounds of several characters and plots aren't dealt with then you end up with a show with a lot of potential but a lukewarm delivery."
4,Mission oak table,The table and mirror are a good buy for the money. There was a slight problem with a missing part that was eventually resolved. The middle drawer does not fit well. There is a gap along the bottom.We have to figure out a way to make it look better.
4,"No ""psycho-babble"" here!","The previous reviewer is correct: This book does not contain therapeutic jargon, clinical speculation or theories about causal roots of blended family problems. That is precisely why I recommend it! Rather, Artlip et. al have crafted a real-world book, from actual accounts, providing a balanced approach to recognizing (and dealing with) blended family problems. If you are considering taking the ""blended family step,"" this book will give you an unvarnished snapshot of the good, bad and ugly (and also joyful) aspects of blended family life. It was not the authors' intent to provide clinical answers, but rather tools that regular folks in the trenches can use. As a blended family dad, I'm glad they did!"
2,Tedious,"Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE anything with Ekin Cheng in it (see my other reviews) however this video was just plain tedious!This is the story of Nam (Ekin Cheng)and his best friend Chicken (Jordan Chan), Nam and Chicken are members of a gang, when Nam gets promotion to chief ""Boss,"" his life becomes even MORE complicated. The plot mostly revolves mostly around some nonsense about a wedding and a rival gang Taiwanese San Luen gang, however most of this is quite difficult to follow - and there is a reason for this. This video is part of the Young and Dangerous series, and viewers are expected to be familiar with the material and the characters from previous episodes.If you are interested in following or even understanding the events in ""Born to be King,"" I would recommend viewing the rest of the Young and Dangerous series first. The Triad series is one of the most popular and longest running gangster series in HK."
2,Not even-handed at all,"I view myself as a libertarian open to new ideas. The author, however, is not so open. He takes one path --- Republicans = bad --- and keeps riding. That's fine at one level. As far as I can tell, most of the facts are correct. The problem is what's missing. What's missing is the Republicans long-standing support for science and engineering. Republican-controlled White Houses and Congresses have been equally supportive in terms of doling out money.Also what's missing is wacko Sen. Harkin (D-Iowa) and his assault on real science. He essentially created the alternative medicine institute at the National Institutes of Health, and he's been disappointed that real science can't validate wacko flower and faith healing. I would like to see a book called The Congressional War on Science that demonstrates the reason is scientific ignorance, not political ideology."
3,One More Area of Our Government's Ongoing Failures,A little wordy but gets and important point across. Our leaders display the failure of our education system and complete disregard for our constitution.
5,Perfect timing,"The hardcore right wingers like Coulter, Limbaugh, and Hannity write books which are nothing more than hate pieces directed at about 60% of America, and pretty much the rest of the planet.This book is the answer to the lunacy of the religious right; a sensible, rational explanation of the mindset the right's utter hatred of logic and science. Contrary to what most Americans would think, the right's hatred of science is nothing new; it's a hate that has been building up for the past few decades and has finally reached critical mass with the Bush administration and recent jingoism.It's funny how the right considers global warming to be junk science (despite almost unanimous agreement by scientists across the globe that it is real), yet considers the Bible to be the be-all, end-all of truth and the meaning of existence. Hilarious."
5,Ripping the lid off the destruction of reason,"The events recounted here are amazing. And painfully unsettling.Republicans seem capable of shrugging off both facts and reason so long as it brings short-term gain. In the long term (and even in the short term) they're so degrading the value of actual scientific evidence, that the ability of our society to make good decisions is increasingly compromised. In trying to relegate science to ""opinion,"" they risk far more than costs of a typical political ploy.This assault on reason may be a greater danger to the persistence of western society than any terrorist."
1,Dull and unsophisticated....not recommended,"The hot title and slick cover are unsuited to Mooney's dull and sophomoric writing. He regurgitates old news, provides unsophisticated analysis and seems to rewrite the words of truly great thinkers and leaders in the science world as his own...a dangerous line to tread, even for the most egotistical young writer. Quite simply, the book fails to move the debate surrounding science and partisan politics forward. Not recommended."
5,Excellent case for Life after Death,Bruce's descriptions of his journeys give credence to exploring the Afterlife. It inspired me to consider the possibility for myself. I appreciated his need for validations of his experiences.
4,pretty satisfied,Pretty good quality when I printed it out. Only complaint is when my computer crashed I lost it and there's not way to get it back except buying it again. Bummer.
3,Aimed at the old-school diehards only......,"I picked this up while looking at a record store the other day, and when I noticed the track listing, I had to buy it. I'm a metal collector and long-time head banger. This 2-disc compilation is great for someone like me and others that actually know Gn'R's roots. (Anyone over 35, that is.) It's a gem to me because of all the L.A. Guns/Gn'R tie-in songs we get here. Not to mention a few Hollywood Rose nuggets, too. This one totally slipped my metal radar when it was released. We get Tracii Guns and Gilby Clarke performing some Gn'R tunes, we get a few L.A. Gun songs, and some tribute songs, too. A good start for anyone learning the Gn'R/L.A. Guns/Hollywood Rose family tree."
2,Best Of Mountain Live.....Not Really,"I'm a big Mountain/Leslie West fan, and was dissappointed by theselive verions of most of these songs. Only really good song was this version of Spark."
2,Why dontcha skip this one!!,"This is flat ot terrible. For starters, the sound quality is aweful. Sometimes the drums drwon out the vocals or guitar and the bass is invisible for most of the songs. Anyone who has seen Leslie perform in the last few years knows he's capable of much better performances than this. Some of the songs are so sloppy and loose you can barely tell what song is being played.Seemed like a bargain. Well, I got what I payed for. It's too bad, because with songs like ""why dontcha"", ""house of the rising sun"",""sparks""(the best sounding song on the disc),""rocky mountain way"", and ""crossroads"", this could have been a killer set. It isn't."
4,An informative book for the beginning or advanced collector.,"This would be an excellent starter book for anyone interested in learning about fetish carvings, or collecting them. Ms. Whittle not only discusses the different types of animals carved and what they mean in the traditional Zuni sense, but also talks about the carvers and the materials they use. There are color pictures on nearly every page, each giving the kind of animal represented, the carver, materials used in the piece, and a price guide as well, which is useful if one is just starting a collection! Besides the Zuni, there are other Native peoples of the Southwestern US who make fetishes for sale, such as the Navajo and Isleta, and Ms. Whittle includes some of their works as well."
4,True character revealed,"This author writes with zeal and passion about the people of Finland; and gives a true picture of their character, warts and all. He reveals the secrets of their heart. After reading this book, you the reader get an accurate picture of the history of Finland and the Finnish people, what makes them tick, and a clear indication of life in Finland today. You'll find out why Finland is such a successful country in the world. Very enjoyable reading. Highly recommended."
2,Repetitive!,"I bought this book to help familiarize myself with everyday Finnish-ness and thought that I would get a good perspective from an outsider.The author says in 200 pages what he could have said in 10: the Finns are quiet; the Finns like solitude; the Finns are good people beneath their cold exteriors. He drove these points home over and over and over again.His analysis was superficial and relied very heavily on cultural generalizations and stereotypes.Nevertheless, if a person knows absolutely zero about Finland and Finns, this book will ram home some of the most basics."
3,Stunning Projects?,"I was a bit stunned when I received this book. It comes with the minimum materials necessary to make your first strokes of Chinese painting, but the ""stunning"" projects appear to be at the 6th grade level. The brush, ink stick, and ink stone are the primary expenses here, so there isn't much in the way of instruction. The best thing I can say is that the book and supplies will probably allow you to decide if you like Chinese brush painting or not. As such, it is probably a good ""first"" book for most novices."
3,"Very helpful text and illustrations, but...","...while th product was advertised on the Market place as ""new"" on the Marketplace, the plastic covering the accompaning painting kit items ha been ripped off and glued on. Some items were missing. I notified the seller but no response. I loved this writer's manner of teaching strokes and color."
4,A Solid Soccer Game,"When you consider the vintage of this game, it is really rather outstanding (It came out in 1997). The gameplay is better, and more realistic in many respects, than FIFA 98,99,00,01, or 02. The only thing the FIFA titles top this game in are graphics(all the FIFA titles), shooting(FIFA 02 and 02 World Cup only)and goalie movement and control (FIFA 02 and 02 World Cup only). The recent vintage Konami titles which have come out, largely in Europe and Asia, must be fabulous, bearing in mind the Company has had five years to improve on the ISS 98 game foundation. If something other than MLS Extra Time were to be marketed here in the US by Konami, I definitely would pick up a copy. If I were reviewing this game in 1997, it would have easily gotten a 5. Since it is 2002 after all, it now garners a solid 4. Not shabby, by any means!!"
5,AWESOME SOCCER,"HTis gmae is the best, it is really realistic, in injuries they bring out a stretcher to tak ethe player off the field. Thi si one of the best soccer games i have ever played in my life! Fifa soccer games don't even have as many options as this game! ITS TOTALLY AWESOME!"
4,durable but heavy,"This step works great. It is very heavy, which makes it difficult for little toddlers to move. As long as you want to keep it in one place it is fine."
4,Very interesting read - RECOMENDED,"A very interesting read that I recomend. It has a very open minded approach to the idea that is witchcraft and wizardry. I have found a new way of seeing nature, and feel a better person from reading this book. A definat thumbs up.!"
2,To be completely honest here,"Yea the book does have some strong points, But the whole idea I got from it was, power to change the will of others and still try to keep balance amongst other things. Now karma does play a role in this but the book makes it almost like that doesn't matter, I think going with something like modern magick by Donald Michael Kraig,is a way better path to take, Magick can not be treated like it's there to grant all your desires like the other reviews imply, It's there cause it's a way of life, well at least it is for me. You can find much better books..Sorry for the dissapointment."
5,Richard Shindell ROCKS,"I liked his first two CDS, but I absolutely LOVE ""Reunion Hill."" Richard sings with such passion, and his songs are so sincere. He amazes me because he can write from so many different perspectives, from a fugitive in ""May,"" to a woman who lost her husband in a war in ""Reunion Hill."" ""I saw my youth today"" makes me cry every time I hear it...he is amazing. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys folk music."
3,"Not up to Blue Divide standard, but still good.","I came to Richard Shindell through his previous album, Blue Divide. This one has somehow less lustre; the lyrics less intriguing, less double-edged, perhaps. Nowhere do we have the rich allegory of The Fisherman or the multilayered metaphor of Blue Divide. The songs are still good, though, and still mark him out as a thoughtful, intelligent songwriter whose work is miles better than most of what is out there. Sad, then, that the same couldn't be said for the arrangements. Gone is the crisp, lyrically rhythmic semi-accoustic folk-rock of Blue Divide; what we have instead is whining steel guitars moving him much closer to the territory of Country Music. Mr Shindell - don't go there! At the end of the day, however, don't be put off by these criticisms. This is still a good album by a talented guy which is good for repeated listening and will grace the CD collection of anyone with taste. Also Don Williams fans. (Kidding)."
3,Reunion review,"The songs are well written and the production has more of a country feel than some of his other CDs. Richard Shindell is a masterful lyricist and the cuts on this CD provide some fine examples of his workmanship (i.e. ""He who made the lamb, put the tremble in the hand that reaches out to take my quarter."") The recording has some issues with various pops and thumps in most of the tracks, and I only gave it three stars because of the recording quality."
3,"A great songwriter, a mediocre CD","Shindell is one of the best songwriters to come from the 90's. But this cd is overproduced, and frankly, hard to listen to it without the skip buttom. Some songs are better, other just drawn in a very bad production. Go for ""Somewhere Near Patterson"" and ""Sparrows Points"" and wait until these songs are released on a live cd, or as acoustic guitar and vocals. Maybe one day..."
3,$36 at oreilly autoparts.,You gotta price match parts before you buy save $20 by going to oreillys. I always take the parts number and check eBay and oreillys because some prices are good and some bad.
1,Can't even read because of restrictions!,Tried to borrow from my local library but when I went to send it to my e-reader (not a actual Kindle) I was denied because of publisher restrictions. I cannot recommend a book that won't let me read it and all because I do not have a Kindle but a cheaper e-reader!
1,This book was horrible...I want my $$ back,"I bought this book on my honeymoon at the hotel gift shop because I had finished the 3 books I brought with me. It was terrible and I threw it out after finishing. I feel like the hours I spent reading it were wasted. If I could rate it with zero stars, I would. Do not read this book."
1,I don't think so!!!,"I had to come to amazom.com to see what everybody else said because every chapter re-iterated what the previous chapter said, he could be friend or foe, murderer or wrongly accused. I got fed up and wrote this review in the middle of page 83. I skipped ahead two chapters and more of the same. Hardly any dialogue between them and no real assurance of his identity. This isn't the last Lisa Jackson novel I'll read but I have read much better. Temptress...I don't think so."
4,Bike Seat,"This Bike seat was purchased to be put on a Schwin Sting Ray and we added a sissy bar also. The seat looks great on the bike but it is a little hard. I would buy this seat again, because it looks great on the bike."
3,Message of conservation included in mystery,"This was my second Jessica Speart novel, and while I didn't enjoy it as much as ""Bird Brained"", it was still an enjoyable read. I love the way she weaves conservation issues into the fabric of her stories; it's also cool the way Speart moves the story locales around to different parts of the country, with different conversation issues in them. This time, it's about invasive reptiles species and shark fins in Hawaii, as we find Rachel Porter stationed on Maui, and again, she is trying not to totally alienate her boss while still doing battle against the forces of wildlife evil."
5,A fascinating book on the Decembrist uprising and exile,"An extraordinary, well researched book about the life of 24 year old Princess Maria Volkonsky nee Raevsky who followed her husband Prince Sergei Volkonsky who was banished by the Tsar after the Decembrist uprising into exile in Siberia. The Decembrists were a group of intellectual Russian Aristocrats who wanted to banish serfdom. It was called the 'First Russian Revolution' . I wonder what would have happened if it had succeeded? The second revolution would have not happened, I think? A fantastic book written with care."
1,Not as good as some,"Big Idea makes many good shows, but once in a while they make major flops. This is one of those. The quality was poor, and the storys weren't very good. I would like to point out, though, that this motion picture is the exeption, not the rule; most of the movies they make are very good."
2,I wish I had sent it back,The service through Amazon was fine. No problem there. It is just that the video doesn't work right in the middle. I was hoping to use this for a special time during a Children's Church lesson and the video itself has a flaw in it.
4,hooray for veggies,Bought this for a second time. The first one got damaged but my children love it so much they kept asking for it so I bought it again.
5,Love it,"I love the Snoodle's Tale. It's a great story of what happens to us as we go through life and hear the junk people say about us. Then, it shows God's amazing love as He takes away the weight of the things people said to us and replaces it with our identity in Him. A must have for all!"
5,Artistically one of the best Veggie Tales,"This was an awesome play on Dr. Suess and also on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. My son loves watching ""Dr. Jiggle/Mr. Sly"" dance, but he LOVES Snoodles Tale. It has a great story. From an artistic point of view, this was really well done. If you get it, look all Phil Vischer's short interview about this. You won't be sorry."
5,Really Like the options,"As advertised fast ship, good product. This is part of my everyday use and emergency preps. I'm ready if the lights go out and can recharge with solar/Battery/inverter combo."
2,Doesn't work for AAA,I've been unable to reach the seller I bought this unit from but they seem to close early so I'll try really early tomorrow. And they have no email but hope is still out there. I bought one of these battery chargers and it works great and exactly as advertised for AA's. But will not recognized and acknowledge any brand of AAA. I assumed it was just a bad unit and returned and bought a second. Hopefully they will advise and correct but 2 out of 2 isn't great... Now we'll see. I'll update.
3,not acceptable for AAA,"The product works well for AA, but uses the same slot for AAA, but with a recessed set of tabs that are too small. Subsequently it does not recognize many AAA batteries, because the bottom (-) tab doe not quit touch the metal of the battery. Thus, you only get about 1/2 of what you paid for."
3,not as satisfying as the MH-C9000 Wizard One charger (made by the same company),"This isn't a bad charger; it's easy to use, but I love the added functionality of the MH-C9000 Wizard One charger more; much more. I feel you have more control over keeping your batteries life up with the wizard one, where this is more plug and go; though it does have a ""battery conditioning mode"". Maybe this should be 4 stars instead of three, but the wizard one seems to provide so much more, it's worth the extra money."
5,Works very well,Not much to say other than it works exactly as it should. If you need a charger this is the one you want.
4,Sturdy unit,"Niced charger. LCD display handy. Buttons are in the exact wrong place. You hit them pulling batteries out of their slots. But, all in all a good buy"
1,Not Reliable,"Stopped working after 1 year+. Flashing ""DONE"" repeatedly with no batteries inserted. Check Fixya.com and you can see many users report the same problem!"
5,First Smart Charger,"The MH-C800S meets all of our expectations. The instructions are easy enough to read, MAHA Energy Corp. tech writers did a good job. The suggestion to use Conditioning in Soft mode for AAA batteries appears to work, the instructions did not include this additional feature. Confirmation from MAHA that the conditioning feature works in soft mode will help others.The size of this unit is what we would expect for an eight cell smart charger, and the finger indents on each side of the battery area allow us to pop out the cells with no problem.Thanks for the reviews and suggestions which helped us choose the MH-C800S! This unit will meet our needs until the next generation is available."
1,"Worked great, then it died","I got this charger and used it only with my powerex batteries. After only a couple of months the charger died spectacularly. It overheated or something and part of it melted. I wish I had taken pictures of it before I threw it out, oh well.I'm sure it's a great charger and I got a fluke defective one. But it still gets a 1 star rating."
1,Died after about a year,"it seemed great at first, after about 6 months it was not fully charging batteries, the same batteries would charge fine on other chargers (including brand new Powerex batteries). After a year it completely died, screen barely shows up, my 15 year old $10 china charger still working. This is a complete waste."
5,battery charger,doing investigation this is the best battery charge for the Ni-MH batteries. Look forward to a long life usage with the charger.
1,Far Side Calendar isn't far enough ...away!,"I have always enjoyed the Far Side cartoons and every yearpurchased the wall calendar and Engagement book. Unfortunately,this year's engagement book is very disappointing. The cartoonsare not amusing. In fact, I found the book as a whole to be verydepressing. I will not use this calendar this year because it issuch a ""downer"" and plan to buy a different engagement book."
5,Plenty Good from Cheri Edwards,"Plenty Good Room is an illustrious tale filled with colorful characters. The main character, Tamara Britton is a quiet and timid woman. When a change of events causes Tamara to become a foster parent of a rebellious teen, the experience is something she never expected. The narrator of the story remains ominous which allows the reader to become involved in the emotions, thoughts, and actions of the main character. All of the characters are relatable in which a reader should identify with each character as the conversations between characters flow naturally (dialect, speech patterns, and all...). The author also does a great job of giving insight on the foster care system for which the novel takes place. If you like novels with mystery and the arrival of a ""stranger"" that shake things up a bit, then this is definitely a novel for you."
3,Good...But Couldn't Finish It,Story had a very good concept but sort of slow moving. It became a task for me to finish it. Maybe I'll try later. I commend the author though for the believability of the story...
4,Another important Lakoff work,"This may not be the best intro to Lakoff's work, but it is the most recent. Once you understand that Dems/Republicans or liberals / conservatives are different and how (George's research shows it's in your view of childraising -- strict or nurturing) then it becomes very important what those two groups' view of freedom is -- I still can't help thinking of the conservatives' view (like most of what they say) as hypocritical, I think it comes from their ""win by any means necessary"" program, and as George shows, they're trying to eliminate or question 100+ years of increasing progressive freedoms. Let's keep freedom legal, shall we? Help!"
1,"don't read this book and argue with a Marine, ok!","seriously. Lakoff in my humble opinion is over rated. Read instead 3 books by Dr. Michael L. Hall.1. Mind Lines: Lines for Changing Minds.2. Figuring People out.3. User's guide to the human brain.and any of his later books. his latest on Neuro - Semantics is the culimation of years of resarch, teaching to international leaders of note... and based on the three books above. I would start with number 1 above however."
5,Recommended,"I friend recommended this to me and I loved it. And I usually don't like yaoi. The animation was good and used a lot of vibrant colors. The characters were lovable. They had the usual anime cliches: closing their eyes when they speak and bad guys who wear awkward clothing (the emo samurai). Most of the voice dubbing was good. I didn't like the chick who played the blonde haired samurai girl. Her voice sometimes grated on my patience. Still, the show was emotional engaging. Key themes include: responsibility, moral conscience, honor, sacrifice, forgiveness, and apathy. The violence isn't bad by any means. Recommended for older teens and young adults."
3,What Can I Say...,"Well, this is another series that I had a litle trouble getting into. The idea behind it seems sound but it just didn't seem to carry thru for me. The hero is a pretty good guy but some of the people with who he interacts with are really sort of shallow. There is one group that's really evil, but then there is the other group in which the leader seems more interested it gaining power for himself rather than doing what might be best. In fact, it seems that, in his own way, he almost comes across as bad as the villian. Makes you wonder. There wasn't a good resolution of this situation from my point of view. This and the lack of a clear ending was my reason for the 3 stars. I still think the series is worth watching as there are some good stuff in here. I was just left a bit flat by it."
4,NWOBHM explained at last.,"This is a book that has been on my shopping list for a while and having finally got around to buying it I can say it was worth every penny. Malc Macmillan has written his much-needed enclopedia in a style that is informative, cheerfully opinionated and frequently amusing. A well as the usual suspects it also digs deep into metal history and gives the likes of Hell, Jameson Raid and Mythra their due.If you have ever wondered what happened to Dark Star this is the book for you."
4,Great one player action,"My first thought with this game was that it would be a clonefrom 'Mario Cart' but after couple of weeks of playing it I realizedit was much more. I found challenging game with detailed race tracks in a beautiful 3D environment, with smooth racing gameplay that is second only to 'Mario Cart'. With excellent frame rates it doesn't look dodge like other N64 racing games. The only bad thing is if you are looking for two player action look else where because it doesn't offer much. Other than that it is a great game...a great buy."
5,"cutesy, but a lot of fun","I am a HUGE fan of the MarioKart games and this one surpasses MarioKart 64 bigtime. Sure, it might be cutesy and some of the character's voices will get on your nerves, but the fun factor and replay value is out of this world! It is a lot better than MarioKart 64 in almost every way. The graphics are superb, the one player game is AWESOME and even after you beat the game, it's fun to go through it again. There are also 2 extra hidden characters to get to keep you racing. And most of all, the battle mode is different, but it is also great. In 2 of them, you compete against the computers or your friends to get so many eggs or bananas back to your base before they do. And best of all, in the other 2 it's just good old fashioned BATTLE! The 2 battle areas are a water level and an ice level, and they are fun.If you ask me, I'd recommend getting Diddy Kong Racing before you get Mariokart 64 because it has more replay value than Mariokart ever thought of having."
4,A little too repetive but fun,"I gave this game 4 stars only because it gets a bit repetive other than that this game is fantastic.Its cool how they combined adventure and racing into one game.It has many courses where you are either a car,hoovercraft, or an airplane!I highly recommend this game."
4,Great Game,This is a great game! Its not very fun by yourself but it's super fun with all your friends. It's graphics are good and the sound is good although it repeats and some of the characters voices get annoying (this is why i gave it a 4) Overall this game is fun for the whole family and will provide hours of fun. Buy it now! This is a good game to have in your collection and is way funner than Mario Kart 64.
1,This game really sucks....,"I am a fan of the Donkey Kong games. I have DK 1 & 2 on my GBA SP. So, I thoguht I would give this game a try. I bought it from Rhino Video Games for $9.99 you can bet that I am going to take it back in and swap it for antoher one maybe South Park or Mario 64.The game has no real objective."
1,didy kong racing,i did not recieve this game yet. it has been over a month since i paid and ordered it
3,A GOOD RELAXING TIME,PRODUCT WAS KEPT WELL. IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THE DESCRIPTION SAID IT WOULD BE. ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER
2,Mario Kart clone... a nintendo fan disspointed...,"I was so excited when I first rented this game. I read tons of great reviews and thought boy this game has to be great! I was totally disapointed. It's a mario kart clone but not in a good way like CTR. Diddy Kong Racing got it all wrong. Controlling the vehicles is extremley frustrating, espically the planes. The courses are totally kiddish. I found myself getting motion sickness and boredom from this game. I was wondering what all the hype was about. This game is very dissapointing, honestly."
3,yuck and good,if you ever thought of buying this game dont its confusing hard stupid has bad grafics stupid characters and really just stinks i just gave it three stars because #1 i felt sorry for it and #2 it has one cool course but if you want a better game get mario cart its so much better its almost like a gamecube game its so good buy mario cart instead
2,The Mario Kart wanna be only deserves 1 1/2 stars.,"I hardly liked this game because it was a wanna be version of Mario Kart 64, which, I thought, was a lot better. This game was hardly fun."
4,As advertized,"this was exactly what the description said it was. Works perfectly, no box or book but the game is in great condition. Good buy!"
2,Nintendo 64 - Diddy Kong Racing,"Like most others who might've already discovered,this Nintendo video game IS pretty much for kids.That doesn't mean that many adults cannot find SOME fun with it.The player(s)have a chance to race on many tracks,like a dinosaur valley,an ice track,a volcano island,etc.Have to admit the graphics are good.At least I thought so.Can also switch over to this game to kill,say maybe thirty minutes."
4,Great condition. I wish this game had richer multiplayer,"I love Mariokart and I remembered this game from when I was a kid. I thought that it had full multiplayer, but I was wrong. The story-mode and gameplay are great, though. You can use a cart, hovercraft, or plane. Good stuff."
5,Back to the Past,"As I grow up, my video game tastes appear not to. Yes, I still play my N64 with some regularity, and this was my favorite game long ago. When I got that urge to play I knew exactly where to go to get a copy. Its in great shape and has been a blast. Im still not very good at it."
5,Comforting? OVERWHELMING SO!,"In July '08 my only child (36) had removal of a malignant brain tumor; by Christmas Eve '08, my husband was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma, chemo and radiation became a daily reality in our lives, and overwhelming so for the last 14 months. For myself, chronic trigeminal neuralgia/anesthesia dolorosa for the past 12 years from a skull base tumor removal. But for Our God!Kathy Troccoli's ""Comfort"" CD speaks exactly those times when nothing seems to make since but Our Father and His sacrifice and deep Love.Thank you Kathy for sharing your love for The Father through His gift to you for so many hurting people."
2,More of the same....,Kathy Troccoli's last 6 non-seasonal albums all sound the same...her best work was in the early 90's...this album is a big YAWN!!
3,Book is half usefull,I think this book is a great resource to make copies and transparencies of sponge activities or bell works but the rest of the book I did not find useful. It included some of the same things you are already introduced to as a new teacher in an induction program. But if you're looking for a good amount of sponge activities than this is a pretty good book.
2,"This book was horrible, even for first year teachers","I will be a first year Bio teacher this fall and so I went ahead and bought this book. In addition to the poor layout, the first 160 pages were useless. The only good thing about it was the sponge activities in the back of the book but even then I would probably only use them when we have a sub or as a ""fun activity"" to fill time. Going back to the layout, the author would put page after page of forms or examples in the MIDDLE of explaining what was going on. For example, you would start to read about a technique, or whatever, and then its 5 pages of example forms some related to what you just read, others related to something else, and then it would go back to discussing the technique.Everything else in the book was common sense and taught in my graduate teaching courses (and my grad classes taught it much better).I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone."
2,not great,This book spent a lot of space on activities that I would never use (example: Anatomy awards). I found that many of the sponge activities were quite advanced for Biology 20. Generally I did not find much that was useful or helpful to me for teaching high school biology.
5,excercise made easy,This video makes indoor cycling a pleasure and brings back memories of places I've been. It is a great purchase.
4,Great fun!,"I've listened to Sara since the start and this has become my favorite album. Like most of my favorite CD's I didn't love this at first listen, but more and more I love this album."
5,Very Good,"A small village is being targeted by bandits. Every year the bandits come for their rice and women. The villagers decide to send their priestess to the city to find 7 samurai to protect them.This is a great retelling of an old classic. The animation and music are both great. There are also many big name voice talents to go along with all the super cool characters. This anime has a very epic feel to it. There's a good mix of action, drama, and comedy. It's simply a masterpiece. One of the greatest samurai animes I've ever seen. There's so much you can say about this series. I'm a having a hard time expressing how cool it is, but you can trust me when I say just watch it. You'll love it."
5,Top Contender for Best Anime Ever,"Though it is based on Kurosawa's work, it is definitely not a carbon-copy, and that's a great thing! It keeps the core basics of Kurosawa's movie while supplying original stories, new characters, and modern art for modern audiences. The mix of samurai and robots works well. There's great conflict in every episode. The characters are deep and have their flaws. The action scenes are a treat and it does not take a dozen episodes to get through a single battle, unlike other anime.While Kurosawa's film was good for certain reasons, Samurai 7 is good for other reasons. It is faster paced than the original movie while still devoting time to diving into plots and characterizations and fleshing out ideas and themes. I'm a big fan of samurai stories, and this is one of the best I've found. If you're a fan of anime, samurais, the original Kurosawa film or other Kurosawa films, then I highly recommend this series."
4,Interesting info,"Written like short stories, each chapter a different aspect of life in Hong Kong just before and during the Japanese takeover, it's very interesting with somehow a humerous and also sad take. Believe most of the stories were first published in the New Yorker. First read it 20 years ago and recently reread it and found it just as interesting.If you like it, would recommend the following that fill in the details of her life, a biographyNobody Said Not to Go: The Life, Loves, and Adventures of Emily HahnandChina to Meby Emily Hahn"
1,Save Your Money. Do not buy,"This person, Heather Hughes-Calero aka Winged Wolf now aka a Buddhist llama Maticintin, is not a Shaman yet writes a book entitled Dialogues with a Shaman Teacher? You figure... Once author finally decides who she is, what she is... and authenticates, perhaps she should stick to fiction books. Her ""Sedona Trilogy"" was delightful reading. Choices for rating are 1-5 star... I would give Zero star if available. I recommend going to Amazon.com typing Lynn Andrews, Michael Harner, Lynn Andrews, Carlos Castenada."
3,"This book is all right, not as a reference","This book is all right in terms of providing the background and up-to-date information. However, there are no in-text citations, just lists of citations at the end of each section, which is useless if you want to look a specific fact, comment, opinion, etc. Further, in my opinion, the organization of the book is fairly clunky, as the fossil record is divided into just a handful of very large, all-encompassing chapters, so that if you want information on a specific set of fossils you have to page through the whole chapter for the section on them."
4,very technical,This work is very comprehensive but most assuredly not for the layman. It does not go much into the Upper Paleolithic as I would have preferred.
5,"Excellent reference, clear, easy to find info",Very good practical book on W98. Not just a rehash of MS Resource Kit. I esp. like the way info is organized - easy to find tips on specific questions/problems. The Registry chapter helped me out of a jam. I recomend this book. It does assume you know basics about W98 already.
3,A great learning experience - solutions untested,"At the first glance it looks great - when you try out the ""solutions"", they do not work and mess up your PC. However, you learn a lot making it work again.I had a memory problem on a 32 MB laptop. Not one of the three ""Bulletproofing Memory"" solutions (Chpater 4) which I tried did actually work. One (long-term bullet-proofing to problem #5) messed up my laptop so badly it would not boot any more.I finally fixed my problem using information out of this book - but I had to create the solution myself.My first PC has been an Apple II with Visicalc, and I have had and heavily used PCs ever since. I am not a PC professional and not the brightest guy on earth, but I have been able to use PCs and peripherals without outside help for about 19 years. So I do not believe that it is because I am too dump that I could not get the ""bulletproofing solutions"" to work.I bought this book during a trip in Australia and I will not carry it back home."
5,"Makes Tasty Sprouts, Good Germination, Good Price","I got hooked on daikon radish sprouts and had been buying the seeds (for much more money) at a local nursery. These sprouts are delicious, and the percentage that germinate is very high."
1,waiting to see about refund,Purchased this warranty at time I purchased the item-Had to return the item and received and immediate credit-at same tiem I cancelled the warrranty-am still waiting for confirmation of credit-although they confirmed receipt of cancellation request over two weeks ago.
1,Useless Extended Warranty - waist of money,"Here is my $.2, do not buy any service contract with them. As Amazon service is spotless the extended warranty service they provide is just the opposite. My experience with them have been terrible, bought extended warranty for a Brother printer which has its own issues and these service provider has been nothing but runaround.First they tell me that they will send shipping box for it to be shipped, waited for a week then I call them again and now they tell me I should talk to a technician who will try to help me first and if the problem still exist then I will have to ship it. If I had bought this printer from BB or Walmart they would have exchanged for a new printer without any question.This makes only Amazon look bad."
1,PLEASE BEWARE,WITH THE STATE OF THE WORLD ECONOMY.... MY ADVICE IS TO BEWARE OF WHERE YOU PURCHASE THE EXTENDED SERVICE PLAN FROM.NEVER BUY THE SERVICE PLAN FROM A COMPANY THE YOU DID NOT PURCHASE THE ITEM FROM. MORE IMPORTANTLY.... BE CAREFUL OF THE COMPANY YOU PURCHASEYOUR PRODUCT FROM. TOO MANY BUSINESSES ARE FOLDING THESE DAYS.I DECIDED TO PURCHASE MY PLAN FROM HP THE PRODUCT BRAND I BOUGHT. IT WAS TWO WEEKS AFTER THE PURCHASE THAT I REQUESTED TO CANCEL THE PLAN.I WENT THROUGH HELL TO GET MY MONEY BACK. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!! I GRADE THIS A 0.............
2,CALL BEFORE PURCHASING,"Briefly, after reading the reviews I was not sure that this was the plan for me so I called. I called Extended Service Plan because I wanted to purchase the plan it took me about 2 minutes to decide it was not for me. The plan only covers internal electronic misfunctions. It does not cover theft/loss, accidental drops/fall, water damage or any type of damage cause by external factor and many other things. This may be for you but was not me, call before purchasing to see."
1,Read the reviews. Why would anyone buy this product?,Why would Amazon even sell garbage like this. Anyone who bought this should contact Amazon for a refund. Stop payment on your credit card if you didn't get your written contract in the mail.
1,Pre-Purchase Query,"I am purchasing a Multifunction Printer/FAX/Copier/Scanner for a home based business. I called the company who does the ""Product Coverage"", NEW Customer Service Companies, Inc. at 800.861.9387 to inquire how quickly a repair would be completed. I was told by the representative who answered the phone, who was obviously being very honest, ""...the AVERAGE is 3 weeks."" Obviously I chose not to purchase the service. Three weeks is a long time for personal products but an ""impossible to do business"" for a home based business standpoint. I feel this information should be posted on the Amazon web site so you know what you are buying with this service product!"
1,3-Year Service Plan for Personal Electronics $200 to $599.99 (Purchased on 09/14/2008),"The product never arrived. I was told it was sent out, but I never received it. I have tried to make contact, but no one takes responsibility."
4,service plan for garmin 660,The same plan offered for garmin 660 at circut city cost more than $150.I saved more than $100.00 by going on line to amzon .com.
4,3 year warranty coverage,"When I decided to purchase my 32 gig zen, I decided to purchase an extra 3 year warranty coverage that'll cover my zen after the year has expired on it. As for right now, I haven't gotten my warranty coverage plan in the mail. I'm wondering if it'll ever come. I trust this company totally so I'll set back til the middle of this month before contacting them."
3,HP printer service plan,"this plan is offered by a 3rd party, not HP. It starts the day you place the order, even though you will not see your ordered item for another week. It is unclear how well it works. It looks like you have to get your item repaired and then send the bill to this service plan. It would be a lot easier to send the printer (or whatever is covered by your plan) straight to the manufacturer for service."
1,Buyer beware,I returned this contract and asked for a refund but NEW ignored my first two emails. Then I called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take 8 weeks to refund my account. I then contacted Amazon and they resolved the matter in one day. I read reviews for NEW and most people that actually had to deal with NEW were not happy. The 77% positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product.
1,35 exclusions,I'm in insurance adjuster so I'm used to reading policies. I've never read one with 35 exclusions until I read this one. I'm sure they'll be able to put you into one of those categories and not find coverage.
1,BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE,"I would give this company a ZERO if I could. They deserve it. READ ALL THEIR REVIEWS.You might as well GIVE AWAY the money it costs for this coverage. You won't get anything in return for this service contract.EXCLUSIONS EXCLUSIONS EXCLUSIONS Galore !!!!You won't be covered for whatever your problem is, THEY will find why you are not covered by all the EXCLUSIONS they have.Protect yourself, don't bother buying this service, you won't get the coverage you hope to get. IF by chance you MIGHT meet their stipulations, then they DELAY, DELAY, DELAY, until you write Amazon, then you only get told to contact the company you are complaining about again. So round and round you go, with nothing in return.So BEWARE my friend."
2,NEW won't help until manufacture warranty runs out...,Part of the reason i got the service plan was to avoid the hassle of dealing with Brother (the manufacturer of a printer i bought). When a problem did arise i called NEWcorp and they said I had to deal with the manufacturer. That's not the way the product was advertised.
2,"If I could get the warranty, I might be satisfied","After a month's wait, and a telephone call requesting my hard copy of the warranty,I have still not received the warranty. Since you told me it would be coming, this doesn't engender confidence or peace of mind that your responsiveness will be exemplary if I ever need it. Please get it out. Thank you"
4,Not sure,Not certain how well this if you need it and hopefully I wont have to use it I will let you know if and when I have to find out
1,extended warranty review,"can't really review for years, since it's an extended warranty, I'm still in the original warranty period!"
3,"So far, so good.","Since I haven't had a chance to use the extended warranty yet (thank Heavens), I can't really comment now."
5,Essential,"Picture quality, sound quality and the number of songs performed don't really matter with this release. If you are a hardcore Fairport fan you must have this dvd because it IS the only film of the Full House lineup, except for an obscure PBS show in the early 70's about roots rock, featuring FP, Rod Stewart and Tyrannosaurus Rex. This is HISTORIC. If you are only marginally interested in FP, don't bother with it, but if you're a big fan, BUY IT!"
4,BREAKAWAY 98 IS GREAT,"IF YOU LOVE HOCKEY YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME! THE PLAY ON THIS IS QUICK TO LEARN AND ALL THE OPTIONS ARE COOL LIKE CREATE A PLAYER, MANAGE TEAMS , OLYMPIC PLAYOFFS. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS WHEN FIGHTING IS TO GET THE FIGHTERS CLOSER TOGETHER INSTEAD OF HITTING AIR. BUT THAT IS THE ONLY DRAWBACK AND ITS NOT THAT BAD SINCE YOU DONT FIGHT ALL THE TIME.. IF YOU ARE TO BUY A GAME THIS IS THE ONE ITS ALOT BETTER THAN THE GRETZKY GAMES OUT THERE NOW!"
1,NHL Breakaway 98 Big Dissapointment,I bought NHL Breakaway 98 for the Nintendo 64 along with the far better NHL 99 as the first games when I bought my Nintendo 64. NHL Breakaway 98 has the worst gameplay among any hockey games I have ever played. The coaching and prospect parts are the only thing good about this horrible game.
4,A pleasent surprise.,"A pleasent surprise. I really wasn't expecting Acclaim's hockey game ot be this good. It is a solid rookie effort, but there are some flaws surrounding it. EA does not have a competing game this year, so this is the best choice. I like it, but a little more polish from Acclaim would have lead to a classic title, instead of just a good title."
2,Obnoxious,"The music is very loud with no volume control and doesn't relate to any of the stories. I guess I was expecting sounds that would relate to the stories, but that's not what you get. You get long, loud, tinny songs. I would not have bought this book if I had seen in the store first."
2,Posessed book!,"Last night, as I was falling asleep, this book started playing music all by itself. It wouldn't stop. Very obnoxious!Also, my toddler has managed to pull out some of the pop-up pages."
3,okay,this book is kinda of strange. my kid likes it though.i don't think we can replace the batteries cause the screw heads are stripped.
2,If you want a real game,"This game is not realistic. You can break late turn late and still make the turn. this game got a lot of good reviews well here's the truth. If you are a F-1 fan buy EA SPORTS F1 2001.(for computer) IT's the real thing.IT has a lot better auido and viedo. you can really read the sponsers on the cars. It also has a Driving School,test day,quick race,championship,and Grand prix. I've played all kinds of racing games on comp. playstation and N-64 and world grand prix is not good. I thought that I was a good driver and I still haven't mastered F-1 2001 on the 1st difficult level. I drove world grand prix about 5 min. and could almost place in the top 3 in all the races."
1,horrrible,horrribeli cant evern get it started. It was a total waist of money. do not buy this or at least rent it if you dont beleive me
5,His Power is Among Us!: A Story of a Healing Ministry,This book is inspired and has a real potential to change lives for the better. It is a topic that is rarely preached about and I appreciate the great love Father Fredette has for people that comes through the prayers and suggestions within the book.
3,a fun memoir on a shell collector,"I was hoping from the title that this was a shell craft book. The author does talk about her making of shell colleges, BUT this book is not a craft book. It's a sweet story on the author's fascination with shells. She gives insight to the history of certain shells. The book is mostly about her love of nature.If you like to read books about naturalists, then you'd enjoy this book. But if you're looking to advance your education of shells-there is much better books out there for that.3 stars."
3,Nice but repetitive.,"This is a lovely little book made up of antique map postcards. I assume they can be good for framing or for projects. The book, however, lacks variety in the type of maps it offers. The majority of maps are from the Holy Land and Jerusalem. There are a few from Italy and one from ancient Egypt but they are plain and hard to discern; there is only one map on ancient Britain and the last one is of the ancient world and is not spectacular as most maps of the ancient world are. I was hoping for maps of ancient France and the Americas. Overall it's interesting but not if you're looking for a wider variety in maps."
4,Eastern European avant-garde,"This is a collection of works by Hungarian composer Erno Kiraly. The information about him in the liner notes is not very clear, but Kiraly seems to be a contemporary of composers like Ligeti and Lutoslawski. His music is quite abstract and often strikingly beautiful, ranging from quiet tinkles and chirps to polytonal chaos, and while it's not all equally brilliant, pieces like ""Actiones"" and ""Spiral"" make the CD well worth the price. I'd recommend this disc to people who wish the Pederecki _Matrix 5_ disc had more electronics on it."
3,Where's Willie?,"This is a pretty good live performance but it doe not sound like Jimmy Hall singing. It's a mystery band with no perfomers credited in the notes.It's called The Wet Willie Band, not Wet Willie, some kind of a difference I'm sure. I saw the original Wet Willie in the 70's and it still ranks in the top 10 concerts of my lifetime. Jack and Jimmy Hall ruled the stage. Jack's bass lines were the best and Jimmy Hall is easily one the greatest performers around , still!!"
1,Make it stop!,"Ugh. This was one of the first rally racers and I had the misfortune to spend... I still kick myself! This game is so bad, I don't know where to begin. Let's see: The graphics are blurry and indistinct. The physics are awful, you bump into something, and no matter how fast you are going, you go backwards 15 feet and do this little hop into the air. It's pretty funny. There's only 3 tracks and 10 cars. The ""co-pilot"" is annoying, you can't understand what he says, and you can't turn him off. So, in essence, buy _anything_ else, leave this game where it belongs, on the shelf."
3,Hmmmm.......,"This games isn't that great. The Editorial Review said it had good sound and music, which is not true. The engine sounds like a leaf blower. The graphics aren't that good either. The cars do control a little differently, but there are only 3 tracks to race them on. One of the plus' of this game is the ability to adjust certain aspects of the car (tires, brakes, suspension, rear wing, and gears).If you want a pick-up-and-play arcade racer, it's okay, but I know there are better games.If you want a racing simulation, stay away."
1,Crash!!!,"You know, it is just a shame that they don't make good racing games for the video game industry these days. Released back in 1997, this one really took a drip trip all the way down hill. The problem with Multi Racing Championship is that there are very few tracks to really choose from. Although there are so many car racing games out there, how could you really buy something with only just three tracks and just 8 cars to really choose from. I strongly suggest you pass this drag, and get either Rush 2: Extreme Racing U.S.A. or Mario Kart 64. At least there you'll really have a good race to play."
3,Disappointing,"The heat conduction in this pan is excellent. No hot spot, no cold spot. The stay-cool handle is a great feature too. However, the non-stick coating was perfect during the first few uses, but it started wearing off and sticking really fast... I am somewhat disappointed with this pan. Particularly for the price!"
4,Replacement switch,"We had a switch go bad on a Cummins hammer drill. I found an internet reference suggesting that the hitachi part 957747 was an exact replacement, so bought one. It is, in fact, a much better switch. Unlike the original, it has a ""lock on"" button. The Cummins drill has a detent molded into the handle right where the ""lock on"" should go, perhaps to keep their options open. A simple drilling out with a 1/4 inch drill bit and voila! The new switch fit perfectly, locks on perfectly, and feels stronger and better made than the original. We are very pleased."
4,Landmark bingo,I didn't like that the calling cards don't have the picture of the different landmarks. So your child definetally has to be able to read. So if your child can read then it is pretty good. It is not hard laminated paper.
4,"Pick the Red book, Pick the Green book","I had to reorder this after loosing my original copy. There are two versions available. The red is Easy Play, and has all the pages zoomed in a little. The green has slightly more complex cords and a few are in different keys (as to be expected)"
3,Muppet Songs,"I only knew a few songs in this book and thought that there would bbe more that were sung on the ""Muppet Show"" eg Mahna Mahna etc"
5,i liked it,This was a really good game. Though the steering may be tight it gives a slight challenge makes you use that brake pedal. I like how you cant take every hit so it makes it even more of a challege plus the speed in this game is excellent.
5,Quality and aforable!,"Hard to find classy push pins for bulletin boards, and these are great! Clift's other styles are gorgeous too, especially the dragon flies!"
4,HISTORY OF MY HOME TOWN,I COULDN'T STOP READING AND LOOKING AT THIS PICTURES OF THIS BOOK. I LOVED SEEING HOW MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS LIVED IN THE TOWN. IT WAS A VERY REALLY A DELIGHT FOR ME TO READ.
2,Oldfashioned,"In my humble opinion the content is simply outdated, dont'worth the money, inside there is nothing relevant that you don't find anywhre on Internet."
5,A Must Read!,"Band of Gypsies is a must read for avid readers. Enrico Antipoda's novel is a fast-paced, colorful work that captures the beauty of Spain, its dynamic culture as well as its intense and bloody political tensions. The book is also a love story in which intern Jaime is fleeing political persecution in the Philippines. Jaime's soft, inner self is well crafted and his shy, painful courtship of the strikingly beautiful intern Allison makes Jaime's character that more attractive. My only concern is that I wanted more. I wanted to know more about Jaime, Allison and the other characters, their inner feelings. In the broader context, however, this is secondary to what is an extremely engaging book that readers will find fascinating. The book is very well-crafted and a delight to read."
2,Disappointed,"This appears to be a collection of writings, and as such it doesn't have a good flow. It's not what I thought I was buying. Further it appears to be a print-on-demand book and the printing and paper quality is low. I'm a big fan of Gandhi's but this book doesn't do justice to his accomplishments."
1,Old,"This game is too old. In a sport where a player has 3-4 years in his carrer this game is of a time long gone. With few players left, it is the epitome of an old overdone game. Where's 2000."
4,This game is cool,"This game is cool, but it can be tricky sometimes.the game play is good and the graphics are ok.it is really fun but sometimes it gets hard like when people from the other team suround you and you cant move.other than that this game is awsome. YOU HAVE TO GET IT!"
3,"Surprisingly, not enough teams","As you can see, I live in Buffalo. When I bought this game, it said 120 teams. I was like, ""Sweet!, It's gonna have all my hometown teams to take to the final four against colleges like Duke, Standford, Michigan, and Cincinati!"" It ends up that the game has no teams within a 100 mile radius of where I live, and theres 3 Division I teams within a 15 minute drive of me.(University of Buffalo, Canisius, and Niagara. None of which are in the game.) First off, Canisius was in the tournament a year or two ago, Buffalo hosted the regionals this year, and Niagara had a player in contension for the scoring title last season when he was averaging over 30 points a game. If I knew my teams weren't in it, I wouldn't have bought this game."
3,This game is pretty good but is not up to it's potential,"I am a college basketball fan and I've was so excited when they released a college basketball game. This game has both pros and cons. First the good, you can choose from many teams and take them through a season. The season starts off with a small pre season tourny. Then you go to the regular season. Then it's the conference tournament and if we win enough games the Big dance. I realy liked the addition of conference tournaments and also i realy like when tournament games are played on neutral courts. Now the Bad, you can't view standings, scheduals or tournament brackets. The only record you will know is your own. You don't see a schedual of the season. My biggest gripe is that no brackets in the tournament. Also a weak non-conference schedual. It does have a little introduction before you start a game about your opponents strenghts, best players and what not. EA sports should make some of thier college titles for the 64."
3,View from the pulpit,"If there are any worthwhile books on Jewish ethics, other than recognized commentaries, I have yet to hear of them. Mamonides in M-Torah states Jewish ethics about as clearly as possible for his time period. Ethical thinking in Judaism is like anelaborate puzzle with foundation and consequences unexamined. Those who wish to understand must put the puzzle together themselves.How many Christians know anything about the foundation and consequences of that religion?"
3,Gently amusing,"Emily,daughter of post war migrants Hanako and her husband,returns to live with her mother after graduating from college and following her parents divorce.Hanako is a devotee of opera and all things European and is convinced that because of a vague mention of a visit by Luciano Pavarotti,he is about to come to her home.She hires a Greek american painter to redecorate and a relationship starts to build between them.I enjoyed the mentions of cultural differences between Japanese and U.S. backgrounds and while I can't pinpoint anything in particular to criticise,The story just seemed to fizzle out towards the end."
4,A textbook I actually read,"I had to purchase this for a class I was taking on Medieval Europe. I will confess, I usually never read any of the assigned texts for classes i take, preferring to take notes from lecture (I find textbooks boring but enjoy learning from the Professor's lecture). I thought I would give this short tale a try, since it was so short. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the story was. I was amazed at how old this story was and at how well it held my interest. Well worth the read - after all, it's a short book."
2,"Did not enjoy a single minute of this ""collage""","I am going to keep this short. The acting was bad. The filming was bad, the various story lines were bad......all of them. I simply hated this movie and it took me two efforts to watch the entire thing and I should have stayed with my original idea of just not watching anymore of the thing after getting about a half hour in.Dreadful movie. Good title (reluctantly gave the thing an extra star just for the title), but that is the only thing the flick has going for it. Avoid it. Don't waste even the price of the rental that I laid out. If I would have bought a physical copy of this thing I would have used it for target practice...complete and utter trash and not worth what little amount of work went into putting this dreadful movie together."
1,BAD,"This movie is awful! It stinks, it rots your brain with thoughts of talking poorly animated hampsters. I bought this as a Christmas present to a friend and she thought it was a JOKE! She was laughing so hard, and it ended up being ripped in half and tossed into the fire to see if it would melt (it did eventually). Hamtaro is a complete waste of money and I put a curse on anyone who buys it or in somewhat ways enjoys Hamtaro, including all the people at whatever station plays this cartoon. This DVD is SO BAD and it is an entire waste of money even to consider getting this, unless to be used as firewood or some sort of practical joke."
1,This STINKS,"I got this for my little brother, Eric, who is 4 years old and even he ended up throwing his cabbage at the DVD player. This DVD is possibly one of the worst DVD's out, and I don't see what idiot invented 'Hamtaro and his Ham-Ham friends,' but they are really poorly animated mice creatures. I don't want to even discuss the awful plot with you. A word of advice: DONT BUY IT!I ended up returning it to where it came from, and I had only watched the first ten minutes. This movie is horrible, don't even think about buying it."
3,Polished but unrealistic,"From the moment the options screen comes on at the beginning, it is clear that this is a carefully and professionally constructed game. Unfortunately, the gameplay does not quite live up to the presentation. For one, AI is not so much intelligence as sheer bloody-mindedness as your players are continually being forced into taking unrealistic shots, the moves are monotonous and ineffective and the ball physics (how it bounces about on the rim) defy any logic. Rebounds, especially on the offensive end, are absolutely impossible to get.However, it must be said that the graphics are excellent even though the animation is a little suspect, and if players shot that laboriously in real life everyone would get ten blocks a game ! Commentary is very good.So all in all, a very well packaged and presented game, but not one for someone who knows anything about the game of basketball; more for the casual gamer. If you're looking for a basketball game, try NBA LIVE..."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Please, don't waste your money on this game, it is simply not worth it. Number one, the graphics are some of the worst I have ever seen and the overall entertainment value is oddly poor.Graphics: 63.9% (D-)Entertainment Value: 70.1% (C-)Overall: 66.2% (D)"
5,FlipKlip works well for treadmill,"This thing is great for reading on the treadmill. I don't know about you, but I find that time flies a lot faster when I'm on the treadmill when I'm reading. But, at the same time, I don't have all that many magazines, whereas I do have a near limitless supply of books. This sucker helps that. I will admit it is somewhat awkward initially, and as you near the end of a book as well. But it does still do the job. Perhaps it would be best to swap books in after you've finished the first 20%, and out when nearing the end. Changing pages is rather simple, once you get the hang of it."
3,2.6/5 STARS,"The 1996 straight to video film adaption of Makai Tensho.This deluxe widescreen edition has both movies-samurai armageddon and jubeis revenge.Its what youd expect a straight to video film would be like, not that great and in this case really cheesy.Picture quality is passable, its clear and sharp enough but not HD.The fight scenes have some authenticity but they can be really lame and slow, but there are some great shots.If youre a fan of the story and really want to check it out then give it a shot if you dont care about high cost film production.The movie is crappy but it has its moments.2.7/5 stars"
2,"Well, there were pictures moving around...","I guess it's a movie, but boyo, it makes very little sense, the characters are seriously half-baked, and the ending seems like it just comes when they've run out of film.It could be worse, though. It could have been a single still photograph of a stale pretzel."
1,Cheaply Made and Not as Pictured!,VERY DISAPPOINTED! I had high hopes for this little gadget. What I received was NOT what I had expected. For one thing the color is not as pictured - the one I received was blackish grey - really ugly. Second the keys are really hard to type with. You have to push the keys several times in order for them to type the letter you are trying to type. Unfortunately in doing so you don't want to push on the keys too hard in fear that you might break them. All in all I give this a 1 star only because the Amazon rating system doesn't offer a 0 or -1. Put your money to better use and purchase the flexible keyboard with large letters. It works as smooth as butter!
2,Dekcell foldable keyboard,I wasn't satisfied with the dekcell foldable keyboard. The keys are stiff and the spacer bar was too small and all my typed information had a lot of errors because if this. I think if you are a hunt and peck typer or hit the keys hard when you type it might be more satisfactory for you. I will say that I have a shorter left thumb because of an accident and that might have had some effect on the typing.
1,"You get what you paid for, and I only paid $9",I should have gotten the $24 version that was better built. This one fell apart in 3 months. Really sucks. Avoid!
2,Purchased this keyboard,well I purchased this flexiboard and im now waiting on a different one I dont like it if you dont hit the key just right forget it you are back spacing constantly it is great for spills and such but thats it
1,Can't give it away,"Very disappointed. The keys were wobbly and if you don't type directly in the middle, it doesn't work. Keyboard was bigger than I thought it would be. I gave up and brought it to work and offered it up for anyone who wanted it. Two people tried it and brought it back and still no takers. I can't give it away. It's still sitting on the file room table looking for a home."
4,Great if you're messy...,"If you wish to type fast, don't bother. The keys are hard to press and often don't make the connection so you end up with a lot of mistakes."
4,Good product but takes some getting used to,"This keyboard works great and travels well. It feels a little wierd to the touch after using traditional keyboards, because your fingers kind of ""stick"" to the keys on this one. So it's tough to get the typing speed. However, keys still all work well and I've had it / used it for many months now and have taken it on several trips already."
2,Nifty but not illuminated,"I like the keyboard as a very basic cheap and portable option. Unlike what is pictured, I received a dark grey keyboard that has no illumination what so ever. Since I ordered it for the illuminated feature I'm disappointed. It's functional for what it is: A flexible silicone keyboard worth 10 bucks, nothing more or less."
1,The description is a fake,"I wanted this keyboard for a long time but never had the means to buy it. I wanted a blue flexible keyboard that illuminated. I received this keyboard, it was gray and had no lights on it what so ever. but if you want a flexible keyboard it at least dose that."
3,Not The Keyboard shown,I got this expecting it to be a light blue keyboard like the one in the picture but nope it's just a black keyboard. Works fine for a flexible keyboard as long as you slow your typing down a notch - But be warned if you've never used one before it is nothing like a regular keyboard. I'd give it a higher rating but I feel showing one keyboard but sending a different one is shady.
1,Have you ever tried typing without an X?,"After returning a previous foldable keyboard because some keys were inoperable, I thoroughly tested this one when it arrived. It worked fine... until the day after I discarded the box, when the key for the letter X failed. Avoid this piece of junk."
4,FLEXIBLE KEYBOARD,"For the price, this is a nice keyboard. It it standard size and is easy to read and clean as necessary. It does take time to get used to typing on a flat surface instead of raised up, tilted, or ergonomic. If you are a hunt and pecker type of user, it is easy to miss letters because of the narrow contact areas under the letters. Other than that it is a great deal for the price."
3,flexible keyboard,The product is good; but the delivery time took quite a while and the shipping charges were almost as much as the cost of the product.
3,Bit of a letdown,"After waiting 4 long years for a followup to 2000's brilliant Nothing We Can Control, Reunion of Island Goose comes a s a bit of a letdown. If you take the first album's less interesting moments (of which there are precious few) and strung them together for 43 minutes, you'd have Reunion. If you're interested in checking out this wonderful band you'd want to start with the fascinating and beautiful Nothing We Can Control. Reunion is for fans only. I'd love to see International Airport live, but this album just doesn't catch anything very inspired."
1,Ah!!,"I generally don't have out of control hair, but I wanted something to control the little frizzes I seem to be plagued with. I liked how it smelled, and when I bought it, I was excited to have a Bed Head product. Sadly, though, I could hardly get the shampoo through the pump! It was so thick, I had to unscrew the top every morning and battle the thickness of the shampoo while trying not to spill any. If it was easier to pour from the bottle, I think I'd like it a lot more than I do."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","I'm not sure what this stuff is supposed to be ""controlling"", but it sure left my hair frizzy and unmanageable, even when I hotrolled it, and that never happens.The only positive I can think of is that it smells pretty good. I've given up on it and will use what's left as hand soap and dog shampoo. I won't use it on my hair again."
3,"A turn-based RPG, with a mix of scifi and fantasy.","Cosmic Fantasy 2 is a turn-based RPG. The game world is a mix of high technology (space travel and the like), and fantasy swordplay and magic. The story has many humorous sections, and is decent enough given the time. There is voice acting during anime-style cutscenes.Level grinding is in full effect here. With CD loading times, this can be a bit painful. Advancing the plot is fairly straight forward and linear, however there's a reasonable amount of exploration from point A to B.Knowledge of the first Cosmic Fantasy game is not necessary, which is a good thing considering part 2 is the only one released in English. There are some in-game advertisements for Cosmic Fantasy 3, however it never made it over.I wouldn't say Cosmic Fantasy 2 is as good as Dragon Slayer (another Turbografx RPG), but it's decent enough to play once."
2,Had 2 Of Them. Both Had Problems,My First one Bought in August 07 was made in May 07 and It would forget the channels every few days So when I went to Turn it On It would have to rescan for channels. The 2nd One Also Made in May 07 but Later A Serial Number While I had it connected over HDMI to my Samsung HDTV the Audio and Video would be Out of sync. The Video would be ahead by 1 or 2 Seconds. It would go away for a day and be In sync but then It would come back and be out of sync. the weird thing is Over Component Every thing was fine but I bought this for the Upconverting so Component is Useless to me. Other then those 2 Problems I liked the Player so I hope in a few months some better Quality Ones will be out there.
4,Good unit with all the tuners,I bought this from TigerDirect through Amazon with an amazing next day delivery with ground shipping. This unit has all the tuners built in - even a QAM tuner! It sets up easily out of the box and records very well. My only complaint is entering titles for recordings. It is cumbersome in that there is no storage for common titles so each title has to be entered from the numeric keypad. Overall a solid piece of equipment that I recommend.
4,recorder works great,recorder works great programming is very easy except there is no TV program guide bummer I am using memorex +RW and they work great. I record the program and put the dvd straight into my computer and copy it then put it back into the recorder and erase it I'v done that 50 times with the same dvd +RW
1,dvd recorder with built-in tv tuner,Don't buy it used or returned! It is a good product whenever it is working but has occassional flared up and often needed to be pulled the plug to reset its memory. Quality of recording is darker than the normal.
2,Toshiba D-R550 Class Action Suit!,"There was a class action suit for the very problems reported with the Toshiba D-R550.More Here:COLUMBUS, OHIO (CN) - Since 2004, Toshiba has sold D-R550 digital video recorders with defective memory systems that lose data and require constant reprogramming, and it concealed the defects and refuses to fix it, a class action claims in Federal Court.[...]I bought two of these units as refurbished online a year ago, did not have a reason to set one up until a week ago. Found the same tuner channel dropping problem as mentioned with one, not with the other. Also seems, that it overwrites a previously recorded program rather than continuing on to the next un-recorded area until the disk is full. Therefore you can't set it up to record Monday-Friday the same program at the same time and watch it all at the end of the week.Even and old VCR doesn't ""rewind"" the tape and record over it!"
4,Toshiba D-R550,So far so good! Product has been easy to use and has provided quality recordings. Takes time at end of disk to write/finalize. Just need to plan accordingly when doing programming.
1,Piece of JUNK!!!!,"I purchased one of these door stops in MAY! I have payed for shipping to send it back to Toshiba under warranty. The device would not remember its programming. The original unit had bad memory. The new unit I got in JULY, has the same problem. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE!!!"
4,Excellent Replacement for VHS Recorders,"I read all the other reviews and I can say I have had no issues with this product. My goal was to replace VHS recorders with a DVD Recorder. I needed the capability to record on one television and playback on any of 3 other televisions, so a Tivo-type recorder wouldn't work. The Toshiba D-R550 has worked flawlessly. I use DVD+RW disks and have had absolutely no problem watching recorded television programs, without finalizing the disks, on other DVD players (even a 4 year old Sony DVD player). Recording is easy and the picture quality is excellent."
3,Not What You Would Expect,"The title is horribly misleading. With a minimal portion of this book actually focusing on improvised jamming techniques, I was quite dissappointed. It explores the technical aspects of jamming far more than how someone would go about jamming signals."
1,Best of country classic,This is a Karaoke DVD. Not a collection of performances by country singing stars. Be advised.
2,Pass on this one,"If you into this kind of film, and can fast forward, great. Otherwise, don't waste your time. The story is weak, the acting weak, and the sex forgetable.The credits are ok. So it wasn't a total waste. But masked charters tip-toeing thru a room like some animated cartoon.. Call the acting police."
1,"A bad, bad, stupid dog...","If they had made it into a porn movie, it would have been as bad and boring as 99% of them. However, they went for erotism and they failed miserably. One almost misses the close-ups and other porn tricks.The plot? What plot? Nothing makes sense. It is soporific, sophomoric and utterly senseless. Only one star because we do not have less than that."
2,So So Film Shows Its Age,"First, If you can find this film to rent, do so before buying. It is listed as a French sex farce. It is more French and farce but yes there is simulated sex as well. It is a shallow film without much substance. It was only an okay film, and in retrospect not worth buying. It probably will not remain in mycollection. There are much better ""sex farces"" such as the Italian films starring Laura Antonelli. It is worth a look I guess, if you can rent it. Charlie Spivey"
