5,Man she's got the greatest voice...,"I could go on for hours at how wonderful Mirah's voice is. Or how it fits every song she plays on. Especially Cold Cold Water. It in itself is one of the greatest songs I have ever heard from the Microphones crew (Phil and his friends). Buy this, along with the Microphone's the Glow pt. 2 and Mirah's old album, You Think It's like This but it's really like this. This is what music really is. This is what music should be."
4,Mirah's Amazing Voice....,"Mirah is one of the most talented artists I have ever heard. This is not my favorite CD she has put out though. There are too many songs that lose focus on her gorgeous voice. 'You Think It's Like This but It's Really Like this' or 'C'mon Miracle' are a little above this one in my opinion. But it was still great, she is AMAZING."
3,wanted to like this more,"Mirah has the most beautiful voice i've ever heard...so comforting on a raining, gloomy day....this genre has never been my favorite... I guess you can compare her to Sarah Mclaclan and Edie Brickell... it feels like these ladies just want to put you to sleep more than to entertain you...Mirah isn't too far away from these other artist...i have a hard time getting into her rants about love and hard times...but a few of her songs on this album make me happy...i guess i seem to like the poppy songs over the acoustic songs...Recommendation and Advisory Committee are such a cute, fun songs...i think i would have like the album more if more of the songs where in this vain...i don't think i'm giving this album justice... but i just couldn't get into overall..."
2,Good mystery marred by poor Kindle edition,"This is an engaging mystery but is marred by poor eBook formatting.First, there are many typographical errors such as: 36 times ""mat"" appears instead of ""that"", 11 ""die"" for ""the"", 10 ""mere"" for ""there"", 4 ""mem"" for ""them"" and many others like ""aU"" for ""all"", ""wim"" for ""with"", ""ponce"" for ""police"".Second, the font size is one size smaller than it should be. This causes you to change the font size every time you switch from this book to another.Third, each paragraph is separated by two lines. This is particularly annoying when there is dialog. You get about 6 lines of dialog per e-page.Fourth, the book has a table of contents but it is not marked as such. You have to page (about 8 times) from the cover to find it.I enjoyed this book, but would not buy another Kindle edition by Peter Lovesey if the're formatted as sloppily as this one."
2,"""Diamond or Stone"" I say stone","Don't bother. After reading half the book I could not finish it (too boring, unsympathetic characters, story line not credible). However, if you want an easy one day read that will not challenge you in any way, this would be a good book for you."
4,Diamonds on the Pad,"Peter Lovesey's DIAMOND SOLITAIRE takes a few pages of reading to get into the story and it is not a fast read because there is so much to absorb.Diamond loses his job at Harrod's because he failed to find a small child who was left behind in the great department store. He is drawn to the child and begins to seach for answers as to why no one had claimed the Japanese child who will not responde to anyone. 'Naomi' is diagnosed as autistic, but a teeny break through occurs when Naomi is able to draw the picture of a diamond indicating she recognizes the detective's name.A leap to death of a pharmaceutical baron, an exploded factory in Italy, a kidnaped child, mafic, and a sumo wrestler send Diamond to New York and Tokyo to local Naomi.Nash Black, author of HAINTS."
2,Kindle - scanned without an editor,"A pleasant and silly read - fast moving and fun. However, the price for the kindle edition is highway robbery - this was poorly OCR'd with no review. This = mis and police= ponce. It's distracting and annoying. The original paperback would be a better buy."
5,Build Your Dream Castle,"I bought this set of blocks for my niece as a Christmas gift.The gift is a sure fire hit for a little girl. The fun whimsical set of blocks is made from high quality wood, comes with a plastic storage box, and is reasonably priced."
3,Great Price,This is a very good quality filter. Heavy duty. I found out later that this type of filter requires alot of Maintenance.If you don't maintain your filter it can damage your car. You must clean and oil this filter. If you don't oil you filter it can damage your car and if you oil the filter too much it can damage you car. And they sell a special lube/oil just for this type of filter which can be very expencive. Further more there is alot of argument online about no real improvment over a regular paper filter. also I got this filter for around $10 and paid $10 for a paper filter at pepboys.
4,Easy Read,"I read this book while traveling on an airline. Between the layovers and the flights, I got through it in less than a day, and that includes sleeping on the plane. This is a fairly decent book, better than some, worse than others. It is light and refreshing and best of all, it does not dwell on anything negative."
3,Yolanda Adams...The one and only,"I first heard of Yolanda while in Panama City Florida she was singing ""The Battle is the Lord"". When I got back to NY I went out and purchase the cd. I listen to gospel music all the times and I like Yolanda...only when she sings slow. Still I Rise is fantastic."
3,"Yolanda is the best, certainly, but...","... this is not her best album. Im a big fan of Yolanda, I have all her albums, but this one is by far not as good as other albums like ""Mountain High... Valley Low"", ""Believe"" or her 1995 live recording. These other albums are truly phenomenal, but this one... mmmm I dont like it that much. Overall, it has a sad felling, I think there are problems with the mixing of this album, also.If you want to buy her music for the very first time, try another album, but dont miss this wonderful lady, there is NO ONE like her, she is awesome!!"
3,Expected more...,"I expected more from this book - at least some concrete, document examples (verbage) on tailoring IT policies. Readers should look here for an overview but elsewhere for mor e detail."
5,IT director,"This book did a very good job filling in some gaps in myknowledge of running an IT operation. This book is veryhelpful for technical people who find themselves now havingto manage an IT department. Policies and procedures are veryimportant in making an IT shop run smoothly, and this bookwill give you a head start in getting your shop in order."
2,Not worth the money,"I was disappointed with this book. Overgeneralized suggestions with no real information on how to make the wine cellar i.e. the actual wood, plastic or whatever it is that makes the place to actually put the wine. I had been hoping for suggestions, ideas, photo's and sources for storage. Instead I got a rehash of information from other books."
1,not worth it,"The picture is clearly misleading. It shows the filters for the replacement kit, but what you see, sure as heck isn't what you get. I used the picture as a guide as to what would be included in the order, but all I got was a huge box with a tiny piece of foam that wasn't worth 10 cents, much less than $10. What gives? Either my order was incomplete, or they posted the wrong pic in the description. Considering the size of the box and the amount of packing material, I have to wonder.Either way, I returned the item in the same huge box they sent it in."
3,Wrong Filter,"Item was returned, it was wrong size. I had ordered the wrong filter because I wasn't sure of the model of my filter.Item had arrive in good time, item was returned & I was credited for it-thank you."
4,Appalachian Autoharp,This is a very nice autoharp for the money. The wood in it is beautiful. It holds its tuning quite well although some of the wound strings don't ring totally true.
3,Good for solo backpackers,"Just traveled South America solo, glad I had it for those times I arrived at 3AM to a strange town and didn't know where to stay or how to get there. Other times, I just met people who told me where to stay or went with me as a guide. Overall I used the book about 15 times in 60 days but was glad to have it at those times. Not very detailed but overall enough to help. Of course, since 80% of backapckers use LP, you will constantly be around other people traveling which can be a good or bad thing depending on your goals. Fellow travelers call it the Lonely Planet route. I liked the route and felt safe the whole time."
3,Not updated,"The book wasn't updated, the bridge over Suriname river in the capital Paramaribo of Suriname wasn't mentioned instead they recommend the ferry! Good for the beginner to find a place tostay but otherwise not so good...."
1,When will it end...,"Don't know what the other reviewers watched but it couldn't be Straightman. Poorly filmed and a lot of the dialog was made up on the spot, you can tell. Far from being a gay flick with most of the movie dealing with straight fighting couples and the boring dialog goes on and on and on making the viewer wish for ending credits to happen soon. Save your money there are much, much better movies to choose from."
1,"Utter rubbish, don't say you weren't warned!!","I can only conclude that the 5 star reviews were written by relatives of the actors and crew. The acting is poor and unconvincing, and that is the best part. Give this one a miss. I believed the reviews and bought this movie, what a disappointment."
1,Over analitical garbage,"This film is one I bought based on the good reviews.....take note of the bad instead....totally boring and self indulgent....like watching two pseudo-intellectual beer swilling men talk about their feelings on Jerry Springer.... the intent of the film was good but it got lost in a morass of words and lack of direction....bad script,bad dialogue,bad sound, bad film....Just goes to show that a gay man can be just as dirty,slovenly,foulmouthed and aimless as the next person."
1,Just plain awful,"Usually, I try my best to find some redeeming factor that justifies the 2 hours I spent watching a movie. As a writer, I feel sometimes that it is my responsibility to do so. But there is not a single character, moment, reel, or line in this film that could justify paying for it, renting it...or even thinking about doing either. I've been entertained more thoroughly by George Bush. His idiocy is at least justified by his deficient mental capacities. The producers, actors, cameramen and even the gaffers should be taken to the back room of homollywood, f&%!ed and shot. I wouldn't recommend this film to an enemy."
1,PLEEEEEZE heed this if you value your time and money,"This has got to be the worst movie I have seen in a very very long time. I never valued the role of a sound engineer untilwatching this flick. I kid you not. To be quite honest, I didn't watch more than 1/2 hour before deciding to turn it off. I was somewhat torn though because at first when I realized I wasn't enjoying the movie, I was hoping that I could dissect it analytically since it seems provide the perfect model of how NOT to make a film. My patience didn't last that long. And I was hoping very much to enjoy the movie."
3,Wasn't Bad...,"This is a Wilton cake pan, which is why I ordered the product, but the only thing was, after the cake was baked in the pan you couldn't see the lines really good to decorate. Other than that, good product, the cake turned out good for my daughter's 3rd Birthday!"
4,good value,My new kitten was apprehensive at first but now thoroughly enjoys his kitty bed. Nice price too!
3,Coffee table reading,"For what it is, not a bad selection of anecdotes and trivia. Could have done without the author's aside comments throughout the book and the stuff on Japanese baseball is now so out of date that it's irrelevant. From 1994 to now 2005, things have changed a lot across the Pacific such as tie games no longer the norm, catchers do block the plate, schedule is 140 games and saying fan seldom boo is just plain strange...Maybe in Tokyo but obviously this guy never went to a Hanshin Tigers vs. Yomiuri Giants game in Nishinomiya or any Hiroshima Carp home game.I did not get this fascination to mention Japanese baseball whenever he could yet almost nothing is culled from the rich Caribbean baseball history. The book is, of course, mainly about MLB's wacky and wonderful and on that score it still is worth the $1.57 I paid to buy this used."
1,Very bad,"I bought this product to replace the one. Used to have before which by the way didn't last for long, actually it lasts for one wash only, the new one (the replacement) was worse than the original one and it broke immediately after I used it for one wash only. Complete nonsense and waist of money"
3,This mp3 player has a problem!!!,"The Rio se510 mp3 player has a good sound, drag and drop works as it should (you do not need software to convert the mp3 format into what ever), the earphones provide a good sound and are confinient, battery life is great and the menue is easy to us. That are all positive features of this mp3 player.However, there is one problem! It happens sometimes, preferably during transfering files from the computer, that the player just crashes, e.g., like windows computers. That means, the display is frozen und nothing works. The problem is, there is no reset button to restart. I figured out, that removing the battery produces kind of reset. This indicates that there is something wrong with the software of the player in general. I think this should not happen!If you can deal with this problem, and I think I can, this mp3 player is a good deal."
1,RIO Junk,"Great MP3 player for people who would rather spend time re-formatting and dealing with nonexistant product support than listening to music. My player is 7-months old and has ""worked"" for about 3 of those months. Finally got fed up with it, looking for something better."
3,A classic!,"I bought this because I loved watching these when I was a kid. Dick Van Dyke is a classic comedian. I like old shows that are hilarious without being crude. I really only have two complaints. (1) These DVDs are not close-captioned. I also own the ""I Love Lucy"" complete series set and they are close-captioned, but were released by Paramount so maybe that makes a difference. The ""format"" on the product page doesn't list close-captioned for either set, but the ""I Love Lucy"" set is close captioned and ""Dick Van Dyke show"" is not...a little misleading (2) A few days after I purchased the set, it dropped in price by $35. I was disappointed, but it is still a good buy."
5,GREAT TV COLLECTION!,"The Dick Van Dyke Show-The Complete Collection. I am so happy to get this Monumental Collection when it was on Sale. So many Episodes, Five Seasons, 25 DVDs, 158 Episodes, each DVD in a separate sleeve 25 and all with the Air Dates and everything you wanted to know about any Shows and many Special Features Presented so nicely in a TV like Box. All Beautifully Restored with Superb Video and Audio Quality, These Group of Characters with Their Wacky Friends really makes you Laugh! Thank You"
5,Comedy Writer Rob,This is a very funny show about a comedy writer and the jams he gets in . Sometimes with his staff other times with his wife occassionly with his kid and so on but hes always getting in them. You should get this.
5,Great american TV,You cannot go wrong this one if you are a fan of original TV. Now that they are finally putting these in complete series the purchase is well worth it.
1,BOO!!! HISS!!!,A resounding BOO!! Hiss!! to Image Entertainment and to Amazon for selling this complete DVD set WITHOUT CAPTIONING!! It is captioned as it is shown on TVLand TV but apparently Image Entertainment couldn't be bothered to do so for this complete package. This makes this an expensive mistake for me - and a major disappointment for my daughter who is severely hearing-impaired. So onto the shelf for this product and back to the DVR to record the show WITH CAPTIONS.
5,Must Have For Every Family,"I have finished the first three disks, so far (Season 1), and can't remember when I've laughed so hard or so much. I watched these shows when I was a kid and they have not lost their charm, comedy, wit or timelessness. In one special interview on one of the disks, I think it was Carl Reiner who said they purposely avoided time-period references like the hippie movement, The Beatles, Elvis, etc, specifically so that the show would never age. Of course, when you see the furniture, clothing, etc., it's dated, but it's all background compared to the comedy. I have enjoyed every episode so far and can't wait to see more. This is a must have set for any family video library, especially considering the type of programming being made available today. The only complaint that I have is that they didn't include closed captioning which is important for my hard of hearing wife. In today's world of technology, I think every DVD should have closed captioning."
5,Great Nostalgic Gift,My daughter loves this comedy series. They were received with great pleasure. The Dick Van Dyke ShowDVD's are a great gift for thoes who love vintage comedies.
5,Great family show,So thrilled to watch what I did when I was a kid. Great talent!! I'm glad to share with my 14 year old son!
4,Dick VanDyke,"Series were ok, but season 1 dics 5 and season 5 disc 5 both were cracked and unwatchable. Didn't discover them cracked until it was too late to send it back."
2,"Cheaply made, misleading image","This socket holder rail is rather cheap. Has very rough edges, preventing the sockets from sliding smoothly on the rail. The rubberized handle is a very flimsy slip cover that I anticipate will destroy itself shortly. The product image shows that the handle should be black, but my handles were red. On the other hand, sockets do snap on and off without too much work, which is a good thing.I bought these because I thought the added utility of a handle would be worth the slightly higher price, but you're probably better off just snagging a handleless socket rail combo deal from here or at your local Harbor Freight. Like this 80 clip socket holder trayVim Tools V444 80 Clip Socket Tray"
5,oh my gosh... get out your hanky box,"oh my gosh... get out your hanky box this is just the most tender stories. No pictures, but just very short stories that will melt your heart. If my son was still young I'd use this as a bed time story. Wow, you will enjoy."
5,A Great Testimony for the Animals,"Short vignettes that allow you to read the messages quickly. These literay sketches paint a powerful picture of our animal protectors. Sometimes the animals that intervene in the lives of humans come as a complete surprise. For those of you who enjoy reading about angels, don't miss this book."
5,Random Acts of Kindness by Animals,"the books are positively delightful and in great condition. such an excellent deal. quick delivery, too. thank you very much!"
1,Animal laundry list,The animal stories are just listed without any interpretation or connection. I kept waiting for some analysis and finally gave up
5,Gin Blossom Fans Will Adore,"I went into this album with HIGH expectations. I am a very picky Gin Blossoms fan (since 1996) and I heard about the Gas Giants because Robin Wilson (lead signer of the now defunct Gin Blossoms) was the lead signer in this band.The result: A GREAT CD!If you are or were a Gin Blossoms fan, then you will love this new CD. It's a bit harder than Congradulations I'm sorry, but there is not a track to miss. The CD kicks off with an ironic tune: Now The Change. And that it is. But for the better. I wish the Gas Giants would crack into the mainstream with the CD, but they didn't and they are now working on their second album. The CD is a pure example of great song-writing(In Between Two Worlds, Now The Change) as well as fun songs(I Hope My Kids Like Marilyn Manson, Like It or Not). There are sentimentals songs, VERY personal and deep (Whose Side Are You On, Letter, Quitter). This album is fantastic and I suggest it to those looking for a Gin Blossoms-esque taste."
5,THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A GREAT ALBUM,"If your looking for a great find. You've found it! I have to admit first off that I wasn't a huge gin blossoms fan at all. I took a chance on this cd and it has proved to be one of the best I've purchased this year. There are just so many good tracks on this cd. So, if you're looking for some good tunes, look no further because the gas giants music is definately decent."
4,Gas Giants debut CD well worth the wait,"Support this wonderful band and contribute to their future success. Robin Wilson is such a down to earth guy he deserves to go to the very top (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, class of 2014... I hope so). Can't wait to hear them live in Tempe again - I'm from Tempe, but living in Ann Arbor now and miss them so. Get this CD and relive the concert experience."
4,Excellent disk for gin fans,"Excellent disk for gin fans and I recommend this disk for all power pop/jangle music lovers.Check out some other arizona sounds: post refreshments Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers, Sand Rubies and the Pistoleros"
5,Album of the Year/Band of the Year!,"This has got to be the best album I have bought all year. I was hoping and praying for a new Gin Blossoms CD and was very excited when I read that Robin formed Gas Giants. I waited and waited and was probably one of the FIRST to get the CD when it appeared for sale at their website! Their sound is much more that what the Blossoms could have done, it's harder and more rock driven... Thumbs up! Keep rocking guys! I hope somone records the NewYears Reunion of the Gin Blossoms in Tempe..."
2,SoE2,"This game is simply not fun. there is not enough weapons to choose from. no auto-aiming. stupid music and awful voice overs. only 3 areas to choose from in multiplayer. missions are far too difficult. bottom line: if you were a fan of the first state of emergency, rent this. i urge you to not buy it!"
3,PART 1,"This is the first part of a two part review. First part, rating the demo, second part, rating the game. Okay, when I heard about the game, I thought it might be kinda cool, but when I played the demo, I kept dying and dying. No fun, but it is just a demo, right? PLay the demo first before anything.[part two coming soon.]"
1,S.O.E. 2 is a let down...,this game is merely based on the 'intelectual property' of the first State of Emergency created by Rockstar Games... ie it's based on some of the characters of that game and nothing more... the targeting of the weapons and the game saves are a real disappointment... I'm glad I rented this game instead of buying it... I predict it will sell for 9.99 in a month or two.
1,State of emergency 2,"the camera in the game sucks. they are no cheets available.this supose to be a fun game to play, not a maze. dont buy it"
1,i am gangsta!,ok this game isnt that good. all this is is a 50 cent bulletproof but u have less health u controls are harder and the graphics suck
3,NICE ADDITION,3-YR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES ALL BOB THE BUILDER AND THIS TOY JUST FITS HER NEEDS-- BUT I SEE NO REAL VALUE OTHERWISE
5,Never underestimate the Power of Salads and Milkshakes,"I've been searching for this movie far a wide across Canada but no one seemed to have it! Every HMV and video store in Toronto, even a store which was boasted in Halifax to have every movie available fell short when I asked about this great documentary, but finally! I found it here!The Documentary is sick! If you love Lightning Bolt and their weird experimental noise rock, wait until you get to see how weird they actually are. Intense shows and awesome crowd response is what this video is all about.And even though it was a VHS, it was still in perfect condition. Great movie! Great band! Fast Shipping! Everything was perfect. Will definitely buy from again."
3,Okay for casual work.,"Well the price is right for the ink. I have used several off brands, and this product is about the same as most of the others. Since you can buy several of these for the price of one real HP cartridge I really can't complain. Are they as good.. Of course not! If I were to send an important business letter, I wouldn't use one but for in-house work, good enough."
3,Well worth paying less for compatible items,"This item was terrific for being a compatible item; however, I was a little surprised that I couldn't properly align the cartridges as expected. That was the only downside."
4,Printer Cartridges,I am disappointed that there were not recycling envelopesincluded with these cartridges. What am I supposed todo with the old ones????????????????
2,inkjet should be jettisoned,"poor ink quality- black is almost grey, colors are faded and not true to colors needed. cheap, but I wasted the money on them. Never again."
1,HORRIBLE,"The Color ink that i got was open and did not even work! it looked old and used. The black in was sealed but the quality is horrible. The ink is smudged and not clear. I will never buy it again,"
1,cheap,i ordered this product and after installing my printer still flashes which means i need ink--so i guess i will go and buy hp brand --wish i would of done this in the beginnning
2,HP 15 and 17,"I was very pleased with the 15, B&W. It might not have been as crisp as an HP cartridge, but certainly good enough for the price. The 17 color never worked well for some reason. The color just never came out right at all, in text and for photos. Unusable. Too bad. I had to purchase and HP for much more money."
3,so so...,"I bought this CD in hopes that it would have some of the amazing vocals off one of the movie trailers. Alas it was not to be. The CD is ok, but nothing to write home about."
5,One of our Rug Hooking Fore-Mothers,"Really interesting look into the history of rug hooking through the work of Agnes Wermuth. I love learning about the paths that women have taken into this art form and, as I learned in this book, Agnes was not only a hooker of merit but an inspiring teacher."
1,Check this out if you need a good laugh,"Its pathetic how this guy and others take Scripture out of context to support their view of something they just dont like. One of the last verses in the Bible says not to take away from or add to anything written in it. I have no doubt that Jeff is a God fearing man and a genuine believer who only wants to help people, but he and others like him are compromised badly and misleading others. I honor and respect anyone who has a conviction on anything and honors it but I have a problem with people who take their opinions to the Bible, force them in it and insist to others that they're right and everyone else is wrong. Thats pride at its ugliest. This guy has been refuted over and over as well as others who are in this belief system."
1,Hack Job that a junior high schooler could have written,"I read this book in the late 80's. The book, at my parents house, is filled with liner notes from myself, debunking this book using scripture and common sense. Jeff ""knows not what he is talking about"". He uses paper-thin assumptions to ""indict"" real Christian artists as being devil worshippers. PUH-LEASE!!!The funniest story is how he writes to now-defunct Enigma Records (Strypers label). He USES HIS WIFES NAME, then claims he takes the bibles admonition to be""sly like a fox, humble like sheep"" very seriously. HUH? What a coward!! Perhaps he believes the demons will now attack his wife for writing Enigma, instead of attacking him.Waste of paper. Perforate this book and put it on a roll."
5,Hail Satan,"This book is god's gift to man. I used quotes from this for a paper on heavy metal music for 7 years in a row. Jeff Godwin writes some of the funniest material since Andrew Dice Clay, except he doesn't rhyme as well. If Stryper are messengers of the devil, then sign me up for hell right now! Can't wait to read his next book. Hail Satan!"
5,"Very, very cool! A PDA for UNIX geeks","I've been using Palm PDAs for about five years now and wanted to upgrade to something new. I had seen the Zaurus 5500 and was going to purchase one before I heard that the 5600 was being released. The 5600 is fast, applications load quickly and the OS seems to be very stable. I haven't had anything crash yet. Setting up wireless networking with a CF card is trivial, plug the card in, run the network config application and type in your WEP key and you're on the net. Surfing with Opera is excellent, you can zoom in and out on web pages and I haven't found any pages that it won't display. I have yet to try the Hancom applications for reading and writing Word and Excel docs but everything else works very well. Now I just need to find an SSH client for it and I'll really be in business."
2,Problematic PX-250 proccessor,"This PDA is very nice except for the PX-250 CPU it uses. The PX-250 proccessor unforuntely runs ARM4 code (programs compiled for the Zaurus SL-5500) at half speed (around 200mhz instead of expected 400mhz). The only software that will run full-speed on the PX-250 CPU are the default applications on the Sharp ROM, some software from Thekompany, and programs compiled exclusively for ARM5 (PX-250). Intel has made a PX-255 CPU which fixes the half-speed problem on older apps, but it is currently only used in new PDAs such as the Tungsten ""C"", the Toshiba e755 pocket PC, and the newer Dell Axim X5 Advanced.Sharp has no word on if they will switch to the PX-255 CPU in a new model.Casual users may not notice this problem, but many will."
1,defect not disclosed,"I was outraged when I recieved my zaurus sl-5600 that I bought NEW from amazon at $289 when I discovered there is a KNOWN BUG in the 250 chip it was shipped with that has even been discontinued. The defect causes the processor to run at a fraction of it's intended speed. When I called Sharp to ask about this bug I was asked what chip my Z had in it and I told them I was then put on hold for a long time and told ""Sharp is currently unaware of the presence of and defect in your model"". The saving factor is that there is a third party patch available you can apply to the kernel which will double the speed of the processor. Know that you are getting what you pay for!!!!! If you want a Z without a defective chip be sure to buy one with a 255 chip. I will never buy another product from Sharp or Amazon ever again. I find such a way of doing bussiness to be immoral and unethical. I sugest you do the same."
2,Not So Fantastic,"I found this book to be quite disappointing, especially at its premium price. The poor translation and countless typos make me wonder if they had anyone proof-read the final draft before they printed the English edition. The photos are good but the text and choice of subject matter are questionable."
4,recommended!!,"Really love the color -- it looks very natural (brown not orange) I've actually done the VersaSpa and felt I came out looking terrible, so this is a great (and cheaper) way to get a nice bronzed look. One thing: DON'T follow the instructions.. you WILL have to rub it in. Just wash your hands afterwards and all is well. It smells pleasant and the odor it does have, doesn't linger, so you can put it on before going out for the day w/out the worry of that gross self-tan odor that so many products have. Also, it doesn't leave your skin oily or glittery. It's beyond me why self-tanning lotions put sparkly glitter in their products.. I could never those on my face, but this stuff.. just spray in your hands and smooth over your face - doesn't leave skin oily and won't break your skin out (coming from someone w/ very sensitive/combination skin)."
2,Blotchy!,"I just bought this last night. I exfoliated in the shower, dried off and applied the spray. When I got up this morning, I had very uneven coverage and it was blotchy in the areas that it did manage to ""tan"". I did a full body spray but only noticed a color change on my forearms and thighs. I have very fair skin so I used the medium spray. I don't think I'll be using this again. So far, I've had great results with banana boat summer color self-tanning lotion - I think I'll be sticking with what I know!"
5,So Easy!!,I used this twice in a row to ensure I would receive color. The first coat dried and then I applied a second coat. The color was perfect!! I am so impressed!
1,Dumped on :(,"I ordered a case of Neutrogena MicroMist Sunless Tanning Spray Dark from this vendor and they sent me OLD STOCK that was manufactured in 2006 !! It doesn't turn dark.The 5.3oz. cans are packaged in the dark orange/gold can with the BLACK stripe highlighting the title Neutrogena. In 2008 Neutrogena started making their MicroMist Sunless Tanning in the lighter gold cans with the BLUE stripe highlighting the title Neutrogena.I was DUMPED ON and used by this vendor to get rid of old stock that doesn't work. I purchase 4 cases a year..and this was my first and LAST purchase from this vendor.Jeff LaBruzzoDenham Springs, La. 70726"
5,Great self tanner!,"I love this product. It goes on evenly and lasts. With the deep you do have to be more careful than with the medium shade because it will get orange if you put on too many layers. AS with pretty much all self tanners you also have to be mindful of what you're wearing if you have applied and haven't showered yet as it will rub off on clothing. I have tried St. Tropez self tanners (foam, gel, lotion you name it) and many other brands and always come back to this one!"
4,Great self-tanning product!,"I have light colored skin and have used this product over the summer to maintain a tan look without the damage from sun. I think it's super easy to use. I take a shower scrubbing my skin really well, dry off and immediately spray it on. I started out with a very light mist and have gradually increased the amount I apply. It looks completely natural and I have received compliments on how great I look. I like the smell and the feel of the product too. My only complaint is that it makes my skin itchy immediately after application, however, I've found that if I apply lotion after it dries, the itch is gone. I highly recommend giving it a go!"
2,"Tricky to apply, but will make you darker",I used the 2 shades darker formula to get rid of the winter pallor on my legs. The change was not subtle at all. It looks like my legs have been at the beach for a week: way more than 2 shades darker. The color is OK...where it went on evenly. The tricky part was the application. After the first application I saw spots that I missed around my ankles and knees (and some dark streaks which I scrubbed off) so I did a second coat. I'm happy my legs are no longer bright white but I'm not 100% enthusiastic about the product because it is so hard to get the application right. I don't know if there is a way to get a perfect sunless tan at home. But I'm not throwing this out yet because it might turn out to be the best option.
1,Not a happy tanner,"This is my first time ever using any kind of a spray tan. I tried this one because I had heard good reviews about it, and Neutrogena has good products. Apparently I was looking on the wrong sites because this product does not work. I sprayed half the can and do not see any difference except in small patches over my body. This was a waste of money I expected more from Neutrogena."
1,As orange as the bottle.,"It was my sister's wedding, and I noticed that my pale skin on my dark lavender dress would not be very attractive. So a couple of weeks before the weekend, I decided to test the color of this on a large section of my leg. In about two hours, I noticed that spot had turned as orange as the bottle. I put it in my medicine cabinet and never took it out again.I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
1,Big Mistake!,"I was so excited about the possibility of a good spray tan. HA!! This turned out horrible! There were spaces all over my legs that didn't turn out. There were drip marks in some places. It was so splotchy. I was just glad I only did my legs and not my whole body. I had to wear pants for a week and a half! Yes, I did exfoliate before hand, but that didn't seem to matter."
3,half decent,"I have mediam light asian skin tone, and wanted to find something that would give me that bronzy look for summer without the fear of skin damage from uv rays. I found this at Rite aid after reading a few reviews for it, and decided to get it. I put some on both legs just to test it out. My right leg turned out perfect, my left leg had streaks and blotchs that were orange, a totally different color than my right. I used a scrubing facial wipe and cleaned up the spots and resprayed it. After which it looked a better. so this is a half way good product , its just that you need to practice to get it right. Make sure you get a light mist over the area not a spray. The mist should cover evenly. Try not to spray in one area too much. Just a tip for those with stretch marks and really light skin, this actually makes them more visable not hidden so take it easy in those areas."
2,did not work,"I am a brown skin young lady who likes the look of a tan. I had a trip plan to Miami. Not wanting to sit outside in the damaging sun for long periods, I thought I would help my tan by using this product. For three days I used this product following the directions exactly as stated. This product did not work. My skin does not have any hint of a tan."
2,Not my first choice.,"I tried this when my favorite brand (Banana Boat) was sold out, and had a pretty lame experience. Though I ended up with a decent result after a few coats, this tanner doesn't provide as much color as the many others I've tried. Plus, the micro-fine mist should require a haz-mat warning...I had to stop twice during application because I was coughing from breathing it in. The fine mist also settles everywhere, and because it has a light tint when sprayed, makes a huge mess. Finally, the sprayer stopped working when there was about a quarter of the can left. This spray has the best scent (or lack thereof) of the many products I've tried, but this doesn't make up for all the negatives. I won't be buying it again."
3,It wipes off,"I wanted to use a self-tanner because I'm going on a trip and wanted to have a nice color. I liked the color, it only streaked a little, but after a day I put on white pants and it made my pants a little orange. I got a baby wipe and then proceeded to see if it came off it did. It wasn't bad, but I would not wear white with this product. I tried the Jergens brand and it was better, although it took a little longer to get the results I wanted."
2,Mixed Thoughts,"I have very light skin, too, and wanted to look tanned - I rarely tan in the sun, but burn.So, I researched and bought this product. I had the same results as other light skinned reviewers - the results were not even on all body parts - my face, neck, upper chest, lower arms tanned. My shoulders, legs, and rest of trunk were white.8 hours later when I resprayed the legs, I noted the results the next day: the results were patchy - parts that usually can tan turned orange, while areas that rarely tan stayed white - I had orange spotted legs. BUT a shower mellowed out the color and practically made it disappear - I thought this product was supposed to last a few days? Lucky for me it did not. Even my can tanned areas faded.Doubt I'll take another chance on this product."
4,Cute story about friendship!,"Cami and Josie are BFFL. They play basketball together, they shop together, they talk about families, homework, and boys.Josie plays basketball all for the fun of it, and is a master at free throws. Cami plays to win, but can't make a free throw to save her life.Their friendship starts to fall apart after Josie discovers that Cami has been flirting with Ethan, Josie's long-time crush. This starts to affect everything else in their life. Now their crumbling friendship is crumbling their chances of playing basketball with WNBA star Rebecca Lobo.I love Janette Rallison even more with each word of hers I read! I enjoyed her other books more, but this was still really good.I found the shifting perspectives confusing because of how similar the characters and their voices were. I liked the ending. It was a short, simple story that I thought was enjoyable."
1,Board split before I even used it,"Picked up this cutting board because it looked nice. I noticed on the instructions that you're supposed to wipe it down with mineral oil before using. Why isn't this done at the factory? Anyway, not long after I bought it I noticed splits in the wood on both sides of the board. And this was while it was sitting on the counter top completely unused. Wood clamps have failed to halt the advance of the splits. I suspect this problem is endemic to all of the bamboo boards. I would have tried to get my money back but I had already thrown away the packaging."
2,Great customer service; defective product,Received the beautiful cutting board before the holidays. Used it a couple of times and noticed it had two large cracks in it. We have and use other bamboo products and cutting boards; never had this problem before. The company (Bealls) was EXTREMELY helpful/customer-service focused and offered a replacement board. [I will definitely purchase from them again!] Will see how the new bamboo board does. I think I just got a dud or maybe this is why other bamboo boards are larger and cost more than double.
5,"11x13"" bamboo cutting board",Christmas gift for my mother - she loved it. It's beautiful and durable. I will buy one for myself.
2,Flimsy and cheap quality,"For the price, I guess the quality is about as expected. It's annoying that the handle doesn't stay together well."
3,Foley is on the loose in The Wrong Guy,"Dave Foley (Kids In The Hall, Sky High) stars in this comedy about a man who doesnt get a promotion and winds up thinking he killed his boss and that everyone is after him in which case they are not. The real killer, played by Colm Feore (Storm Of The Century, Highwaymen) was payed by the new guy who just stepped into the deceased boss' chair to kill him. Foley goes on a frantic run around getting into awkward situations, like eatting 10 tin cans of tainted meat, meeting a narcaleptic woman played by Jennifer Tilly (Seed Of Chucky, The Cat's Meow) and so on and so forth. the movie is really funny in a lot of parts. Foley's friend from Kids In The Hall Kevin McDonald (Senior Trip, Sky High) is in a funny cameo as a hotel clerk. Also starring David Anthony Higgins (Malcolm In The Middle) who co-wrote with Foley."
5,Hilarious movie...A Bizarro Fugitive!,"This is a very funny movie, especially if you like twisted comedies like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. Also if you like Kids in the Hall and the Simpsons because two of the writers are guys from those shows. In some ways, this movie is a bizarro retelling of the Fugitive movie and TV series with lots of clever jokes. My favorite part is when Foley's character gets caught in a feud between the local banker and a small town farmer--but with a very unexpected twist. This movie will make you laugh."
4,Actually enjoyable,"When I sit through first 10 minutes, I rolled my eyes. All that affected screaming and ""funny"" faces the main character was making that were like bad parody of a french comedies from 70ties. Then I thought that maybe it is a low budget independednt film. In any case the movie got rolling after like 20 minutes and I laughed quite a lot. Yes the jokes are all predictable and cheasy, you wish the main character acts better, but all together it quite works. The movie doesn't try to be too serious about itself which is a bonus, but I think the main drawback is a dynamics. Sometimes the jokes play too long. It is like the main character needes to look surprised for 10 seconds while you need to have like 1 sec to get the joke. Otherwise I think it is a fresh commedy removed from the hollywood stereotype."
5,Comedy genius,"This movie is excellent. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting something different than the predictable hollywood sludge being produced these days. It's well written, acted and produced. So simple, yet so hilariously genius!!"
1,The wrong DVD,"Watch out - make sure you are buying the widescreen version and not the so-called ""fullscreen"" version - I have submitted a product update and hopefully Amazon will fix this so nobody else gets stuck with a lousy ""fullscreen"" DVD unless they are stupid enough to prefer that."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"This movie was one of the slowest and worse movies I have ever seen. I enjoy Dave Foley in Newsradio and Kids in the Hall, but his movie was not funny at all and was very slow. My advice is don't waste 90 minutes of your life on this terrible movie."
4,"More like the ""DAVID FOLEY STORY""","This is a movie that takes a comedy in a different direction where the funny parts are plain to see and David Foley outlines them with such a witless sense of serious drama that makes the film somewhat pointless in a very hillarious sort of way. Running into his dead boss, to tampering with the crime evidence, and trying to run from the cops, thinking there after him. From meeting the Narcoleptic girl, and the poor innocent banker who is getting ruined by a evil, rich, devilishly cunning farmer guy. This was a bit overdone perhaps. Everything about this movie is goofy, and brings out the best in David Foley and for all the fans that enjoy his dry sense of comedy and black comedy if you will. If you like David Foley. You'll like this movie."
2,I didn't hate it...,"I bought this because I'm a huge Kids in the Hall fan and I read all the good reviews. But, I just didn't find it to be very funny. Put it this way, I was content to watch it, but I didn't laugh once. Who am I though? You might find it to be the funniest movie ever. I just recommend that you rent it before you decide to purchase."
4,it makes the job done,"this adapter is well made, may not be a professional looking product but it works well on my karaoke microphone mixer"
1,"Didn't buy it, not priced right and colored wrong.","I didn't buy this cable so this review is more about the product being colored wrong. As of the time of writing, this product is described as a mono-male 1/4 to 2 RCA Females. If the 1/4 is mono, both of the RCA's can only be a mirror of that signal: a mono 1/4 is not a stereo 1/4. Certainly, the description is right too -- you can see the male is a TS not a TRS terminator.So why the hell would they color it as Red (right) / White (left)? It makes no difference. This is rather silly. It kind of bothers me that they're too cheap to change the colors of the RCA adapters.Further, the HOSA adapter,1/4 Mono Male / 2 RCA Female, 6"" Y Adaptoris cheaper ($1.50 more, but shipping is free which makes it $2.50 cheaper)! HOSA is pretty much the middle-of-the-line cable vendor on Amazon. I have a lot of their stuff. HOSA also colors their RCA more logically both are black."
1,Not what was advertised!!!!!,"I clicked on the picture link that was advertising the ATP Knowledge test, which is what I needed. Instead, I received an manual on how to instruct pilots to take the test. I am not a pilot and I needed to study for the ATP/ADX test to become a Dispatcher. I even tried to request a refund and return the book, but it was nearly impossible to do this. Amazon's site just keapt going in circles to the same spot at the begining of the returns process. Very disapointed with this transaction and now stuck with this book for no reason. Wish I could have had a different outcome."
3,No lapel mic,"I ordered this unit with a lapel mic to use with my video camera. When it arrived, it came with the handheld mic, not suitable for my application. So I contacted the seller to correct the problem and they informed me that they didn't carry the lapel version. They quickly gave me and RMA so there was no problem getting my money back, but I was dissapointed that I didn't get what I had ordered. It looks like they have fixed the listing on Amazon, so as long as you want the hand-held version, go for it. To be fair, I never even plugged the mic in so I don't know how it sounded or what range it had but I will say again that the customer service was good."
5,Get this AND the Fairlead with the large roller,"For a complete solution for your ATV plow, get this 8' synthetic rope and the Warn W69373 fairlead. You need to replace your fairlead anyway, so you might as well get this one that has the large bottom roller. You should also get the Warn 80831 (4505-0291), synthetic 3/16"" x 50' winch rope for summertime riding. I suspect you'll never have a problem again with broken winch ropes when using a plow."
1,Terible Product,Didn't last at all!!! Used it less than 10 times and it snapped! Not worth the additional money they charge for this ROPE!!!
3,Surprise! It is a section of pink rope.,"Seems rather expensive for a simple and rather short section of pink rope to use instead of your cable.I don't see why any plastic/nylon/etc rope wouldn't work just the same, even if you had to replace it a few times a season."
1,Rope not recommended,I purchased rope hoping it would be a resolution to damaging cables when plowing. Not the case. Rope broke after an hour of use. I do not recommend this product.
4,"R&B OST, anyone?","I don't really care about the flick itself and I don't intend to see this ""sequel"" (The original movie was horrible, isn't?)Anyway, the most interesting in this Dr. Doolittle stuff is the soundtrack. Although I'm not sure why some boybands like O-Town (""We Fit Together"") or LFO (Life is Good) are in this more r&b fitting movie but the CD is still okay.Some of the good stuff in here are ""Cluck Cluck""- The Product G&B, the awesome collaboration of RL, Snoop Dogg & Lil Lil' Kim's ""Do You Wanna Roll"", the rough tounged rapping of Flipmode Squad's ""What It Is (Part II)"". If you enjoy more of the r&b scene, these are the tracks that will relax you somehow-Alicia Keys' ""Rear View Mirror"" and Luther Vandross' oozing voice ""If I Was The One"". Other neat songs would be Next's ""Lookin' For Love"", Jimmy Cozier's ""Two Steps"" and Deborah Cox' ""Absolutely Not""."
2,Dr. Feelgood,"This 13 song soundtrack from the movie, Dr. Dolittle 2 fit the concept of the movie as a mainstream pop appeal to it. For R.L., Snoop Dogg & Lil' Kim, they provided a West Coast, fun groove on ""Do U Wanna Roll (Dolittle Theme)"". ""Tameeka"" by Mario with Fabolous is a song about getting this one woman, but trying to play her and never hearing from her again. O-Town hit it right on the nail with the highlight track ""We Fit Together"". Probably the hardest song that nearly disrupts the album and movie's chemistry is ""What It Is (Part II)"" by Flipmode Squad featuring Busta Rhymes (with Kelis). Next with Lil' Zane provided a near club tune as they were ""Lookin' For Love"" while inside the club. And the last song, ""If I Knew"" by Medeiros, and the last worth mentioning is a slower song that ties in with the feel and direction of this LP. Not a bad movie, which was intended for children's viewing, but not enough singles and or solid work."
2,So much talent...So bad CD!,"I was really, really disapointed by this CD. I bought it because I love the artists on it especially RL, NEXT, Alicia Keys and Luther Vandross...but when I listened to the CD, I only found 4 songs on the whole CD that I actually liked. Perhaps you need to make this decision for yourself whether you like it or not, I hope you do, I was just disapointed."
2,Author - Please Improve this book!!,"* Note: Would the author of this book please take note to the following!!I have started reading this book, but I am already finding it time consuming and non-efficient. As a designer, I have used countless manuals. Comparing this to a friends Lightwave 7 manual I have these things to say:* although the book has information to relate, it does so badly. Points are not set out in the text, and tutorials are not taken through in steps (rather, a mass of info). The tutorials and general text are waffly and badly written. The author should have written in a concise, informative, bullet-point style format. Also, it would help to have helpful hints at side of text - in margin.* Pictures are B/W and appaling* The book starts relatively well, but when it gets to tutorial in 3rd chapter, the author gets really lazy and does not explain in-between steps and wastes readers time!If you are to buy this book, be sure to have plenty of time on your hands and a highlighter!!"
2,an exercise in frustration,"like a lot of these books, yes, you can learn a lot from it. but it leaves out huge holes that you'll have to gain another way. in particular the index is nearly worthless; major terms are left out altogether. it's more of a compilation than a single author's effort, and it really shows. disorganized, random, confusing...not what you want when trying to tackle a large complex app like this.glad to see other publishers are finally offering something for this app."
2,The Cinema 4D XL Handbook,"This handbook hardly lives up to its billing as a comprehensive guide to the tools and power of C4D XL 6.0 and 7.0. It clearly was written for version 6 of the software and quickly and, I might add, poorly revised to a accommodate version 7. The tutorials if better presented could have been helpful. The tutorials, instead, are vague, poorly illustrated, and confusing. In his attempt to provide something for both expert and beginning users of Cinema 4D XL, Watkins misses the mark."
4,Not bad for the Price,"As a new digital camera owner, I wanted all the bells and whistles I could afford. This seemed the logical choice. I use the bag, tripod, lenses and the extra battery constantly. I did not keep/use the cleaning brush - the bristles fall out, or the memory disk holder [ too small and unnecessary for me]. The only problem was the packing - I did not feel it was packed well. But all arrived undamaged."
5,fast player,i like to play really fast and these dont tire out your wrist. if all you do is down strokes then a thicker pick would obviously do better.
1,HOW MANY COME IN A PACK?,How many come in a pack? Why would they post this and not give the amount of picks it comes with?
5,Outstanding First Novel!!!,"I loved this touching novel by Judi Blaze. The depiction of the two brothers has great depth and insight. As someone who grew up in the 50's in the Pacific NW, this novel certainly brings back the memories of the injustices inflicted on the Native American people in our region and the discrimination they had to endure, so much so that they were encouraged and or forced to be everything ""white"". This is endearing story of a Native American family, their hardships, struggles and triumphs in the face of discrimination. A great read....can't wait to read it again....after it finishes making the rounds of family, neighbors and friends! You need to read this novel....you will be glad you did."
2,Slick.. but VERY HEAVY,"This is a very slick and professional laptop backpack, with several well-organized comparments. However, it's twice as heavy as my laptop (which ain't no lightweight) and I don't recommend it for grad students.. specially if you're like me and carry your thesis around on your back. DO wish someone would come up with a good-looking yet lightweight bag.."
2,Nice Size but not for regular use,"I was an Auditor and needed a sturdy bag for my laptop and files. I used this for a couple of months and the top handle broke. So for light use may be a good option but not for intense use- airports, work, etc."
4,"An excellent album, but not his best.","I love RHH, and never miss his live shows when he is in Chicago. This is another great album, with most of the songs about cars or Jimbo. Not as good as ""Spend a night in the box,"" or ""Full custom gospel"", but much better than ""Space Heater."" Rave on, Rev!"
5,Best album in years!,"Although the Reverend has always been and continues to be a kickass live act, the past two studio albums left me disappointed. Then along comes ""Lucky 7"", his best album in years! There isn't a bad song on this smokin' disc! This is the stuff that made me a fan in the first place. Buy this disc, you won't regret it."
5,Another winner from the Rev',"I somehow missed this band for years, but, thank God I finally caught up with ""Spend a Night in the Box"" which everyone seemed to agree was their best in years. ""Lucky 7"" doesn't slow down until you need it to in order to catch your breath and wipe off the sweat. Even then, the songs are essential listening (don't skip ahead or you'll miss some gems- especially ""Duel at the Two O'Clock Bell""). The few slow tunes typically found on most of their albums are a real pleasure here and sound like they really had fun. Jim Heath hasn't lost anything in the guitar pyrotechnics and the superb backing of Jimbo Wallace and Scott Churilla gives you more to listen to each time you hear a song. Clearly they spent time on this and have turned out a great CD whether you want to call it rockabilly, psychobilly, ...whatever. If you've liked anything from these guys, you need this one. If you haven't ever heard them catch up NOW! This would be a great introduction to their talent."
5,Lucky 7 is Amazing!!!!,"I knew there wasn't a chance that Reverend would let me down; the band keeps getting better and better. Fans of the early Reverend will be happy with this one, as it follows very closely to LIQUOR IN THE FRONT. Scott Churilla really comes forward on this album with a show of amazing drum work. Make sure not to pass on this one!"
1,Weak City,"I recently purchased this disc and I must say, I am ashamed to even have it in my collection. I am either going to sell it to a second-hand store, or throw it in the river. What is all the fuss about this guy? I don't get it. O.K. He is a great guitar player - I'll give him that. But, his singing and songwriting are lousy. ... I also recently purchased the Blasters ""American Music"" which is excellent. Folks, don't waste your time or money on this one. ..."
2,A disaster,"I also used this for a trip to belize. I think the sunblock worked fine but the bug repellant did not work at all. I returned from my trip absolutely covered in bug bites. Plus, this smells atrociously sweet. And it did not close properly. I had to wrap it in ziploc bags and it would still manage to spill everywhere. Not recommended."
2,Weird Color,I detest the blue color of the cream. It takes a while to blend in and leaves a residue. I highly recommend the white cream in the white bottle--same product without color.
1,I'd buy it...............IF IT WASN'T UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I saw this toy here on Amazon and wanted to buy her cause she was pretty, so i went into the store today to get her, and what a huge surprise!!!!!!! She's the ugliest doll ive EVER seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She has on too much make-up and her lips are very fat and ugly! I am not surprised my this product, scince My Scene is usually very disapointing.

5,And a 10 Foot Pole,"The quintessential resource book for RPG tabletop. Versatile for all game systems for a price guide for your player characters, this book covers anything from the Iron Age to modern times. You need to know what a Winchester 30.30 will cost in the 1800s or maybe a Tommy Gun during the Roaring 20's this book will cover everything you and your players need. It is a soft TPB so beware that rough handling could cause issues. Totally worth the money. Highly recommend it for the gaming enthusiast....And a 10-Foot Pole (Rolemaster Standard System)"
2,Useless?,"This gaming aid might not be for everybody. If you need descriptions of the mentioned items, you'll have to look elsewhere. My copy is gathering dust on the shelf at the moment and I'm afraid it'll stay there for some time."
4,REAL SOLID...,"If you're from Philly, there's no excuse not to own this...Esoteric absolutely kills it throughout...Celph Titled supplies another Joe Pesci in ""Goodfellas""-worthy Best Supporting performance...Apathy's unreal on everything; pick up his debut ""Eastern Philosophy"" before this collabo...

Pick up ""Invisible Empire"" if you like what you hear. Dude's amazing....Solid job, Vinnie..."
3,Correction,"My last review of this album was based on a track list i found that had the wrong tracks. I've baught the album and although some of the beats are subpar i think the collection of dope emcees makes up for that. Apathy, Outerspace, & Chief Kamachi hold it down, but to me the person who stands out is Celph Titled (especially on the title track). can't wait for a true Celph Titled solo to drop. I can't help but agree with most reviews that stoupe should have produced at least 1 or 2 tracks, Vinnie Paz said in an interview that during the european part of his tour he met some producers he decided to showcase on this album. Lyrically i'd give it 4 or 5 stars but the beats could have been better."
4,"Half the tracks get a five, the other get a 2 or 3.","This album has some amazing tracks and some terrible tracks, but overall it's another solid release for Baby Grande. Some of these tracks are bangin, while others seem out of place or just plain weak. The top MC's on this disc are Planetary, Reef the Lost Cause, Celph Titled, and Apathy. The worst is Esoteric. I know he has a nice following, and his lyrics are dope, but his flow is just awful. The production is tight on most tracks, but lacking on a few. Overall it's a nice disc, and should be purchased by all hardcore fans. Some of these tracks are really sick, and will definitely lead to some head noddin.Top Tracks (In my opinion)1. Henery the Eigth (One of the best beats ever, sick lyrics)2. Battle Cry (Hardbeat, AOTP's attempt to remake WU-Tangs ""Triumph"")3. Tear it Down (this is a banger)4. Feast of the Wolves5. All Shall PerishWorst Tracks1. Wrath of Gods2. Pull the Pins Out"
1,Emerald Wipeout,"Hal Jordan was a character whose adventures I grew up reading. He was a character I liked, but not one of my personal favorites. I was very sorry to see destroy a hero, but even more disapointed in the way it had been done. If this had been a great comic it would have been worth it, but this was just more of the even-driven tripe DC was pushing at the time. Thankfully, it seems comics have moved past it."
1,Too rushed and not worth a nickel,"Wow. Want to know how to write a comic? Don't look at this turkey, that's for sure. The writing is weak and the plot has so many holes in it that it borders on the ludicrous."
1,Can it get any worse?,"When I was growing up, I'd watch the Superfriends on TV. One of my favorite characters was Hal Jordan. While I never read comics as a child, I found new interest in reading them during the Death of Superman storyline. Once again, Hal Jordan played a big role in the storyline. I decided to pick up the book and happened to start right at the beginning of Emerald Twilight. I was horrified. Hal turned into a mass murderer, killing his trusted friends and stealing the power battery's power. While I liked his replacement, Kyle Rayner, I grew to understand the importance that Hal Jordan held in the GL mythos. Emerald Twilight was a travesty."
2,Bummed series,I think There just trying to through Hal out and enter a bozo who usually always loses in comic crossovers.
3,A Fallen hero gives rise to a New dawn,"While EMERALD TWILIGHT may be reviled by many readers as the ultimate act of bastardry in comics history, the truth of the matter is that heroes are human. Hal Jordan was the last of the true Silver Age heroes, and was not prepared to deal with the harsh new world around him. The destruction of Coast City symbolises the death of the innocence of a time gone by, and with it too must go Hal Jordan - a stalwart hero too far an anachronism to remain. While the story was indeed rushed to fit into the space of three issues (and should have been given more space), it gives rise to the new version of Jordan - the omnipotent, omnicient (and far more interesting) Machiavellian hero, Parallax. It also gives us the first glimpse of the Last of the Green Lanterns, Kyle Rayner, and begins his journey from young neophyte to hero."
1,Abandoning an icon.,"A rushed job, a novice writer, and an exceptionally controversial decision team up to make what could have been an intriguing storyline and turn it into a farce. Ron Marz's lack of familiarity with Hal Jordan and the rest of the cast virtually bleeds through at every panel, and the awkward pacing makes me wonder where Kevin Dooley (the editor) did his job. Melodramatic, unrefined, and ultimately unworthy of the character ruined by this farce. This comic helped mark the end of the speculator craze when even other members of the industry condemned it."
1,Dosn't deliver!,"While the premise of ""Emerald Twilight"" starts off promisingly (legendary GL Hal Jordan goes rogue), it ultimately falls apart with no real resolution to make sense of it all. There are simply too many places where characters betray their established histories (Hal killing, the Guardians resurrecting villains) or the logic of the plot is nonexistent (how can one GL possibly accomplish everything Hal does in this story?). DC Comics legend has it that this storyline was put together in a very rushed manner when former GL writer, Gerard Jones left (or was let go) abruptly. Frankly, the lack of plotting and attention to detail shows."
1,A complete disrespect to fans.,"If you're a new reader and you've never read Green Lantern before, this book won't mean anything to you. The plotline is confusing, full of characters that you don't know who they are, actions flow in a reckless sequence and it lacks suspence and creativity. If you've been reading Green Lantern for years now, the book is not only a creative disaster, but it will disrespect your passion for the true and nobel hero that Hal Jordan has always been to you. If you can't relate to Hal Jordan because you don't know him, try to imagine that a villain has blown up Metropolis and Superman goes crazy, turns into a villain himself and murders other fellow heroes throughout the planet. That's what's they did with Hal Jordan. Don't wait your time and money with this book, the creators were just trying a cheap way out to introduce a new character, it was purely made for commercial reasons, no art not talent involved."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"As an avid reader of Green Lantern for many years, I was very disappointed in the quality of Emerald Twilight. In fact, many fans have dubbed this work ""Emerald Toilet"". The plot is VERY weak, the timing is irrational, and there are plot holes large enough to drive a Galaxy-class Starship through.This book was selfishly devised by Kevin Dooley and a few other managers at DC Comics to introduce a new character, but the story is so weak, convoluted, and out of sync with GL history that the true reason for its publication is crystal-clear: to introduce a new character (Kyle Rayner), while sacrificing the noble existing character (Hal Jordan).The story is poor, the pace of the action is ridiculous, and the content demonstrates that Ron Marz and Kevin Dooley have little respect, and even less knowledge of the Green Lantern legacy.Do not waste your money on this worthless collection of falderal."
2,I didn't like it,This toy is cute but really small about the size of hot weels car so I think is to expensive for what u were expecting and really small for lil ones small pc
2,"No magnetic ""thing"" for Benny to carry","My son received Benny for Christmas 2008 along with just about every other Bob the Builder die cast. While Benny is built well just like all of the others, we were disappointed to see that he did not come with the tube that he is shown carrying. Instead of a magnetic item for him to carry, like most of the other characters, he came with a thin plastic and non-magnetic pile of wood. It is hallow and bottomless, so you can just put it over his ""arm"" to carry, but it is not magnetic so it falls off easily. It also came with a small container of play dough and my guess is that Benny's original design included an easy to swallow item, so they quickly replaced it with play dough and the plastic wood. His arm is still magnetic though, so he can carry items from the other Bob characters."
4,Devious Downtempo,"This CD is always in my car, and tracks 10 thru 15 (the funky, jazzy, mellow portion of the CD) help me fly thru 2am traffic the best. The only track i always seem to skip over is the Hero theme - of all the choices, why this? - and the Prelude & Fugue in C Minor. I'd rather this CD had gone out in a blaze of funk than that brain-drooling, wishy-washy note."
3,fila brasilliyaaaawn,"I usually love their (Fila's) work, but as mixers on this compilation, they sort of put me to sleep. Since, I tend to listen and focus into the music, this proved a little frustrating as I passed it off as background ambience. Maybe this what they were going for???"
2,unsatisfying,"Despite the previous reviewer's assurance that this book goes into great detail on the grammar, on which basis I purchased it, the grammatical section only occupies the first few pages and is spare, to say the least. There are a few tables of verbal conjugations and that's it. The rest of the book is a dictionary, which is outmoded by several other much better dictionaries available from Amazon.There is an excellent grammar of Nishnaabemwin available from Amazon. This is a slightly different dialect to Minnesota Ojibwe, but they are similar enough that it makes no difference."
3,Not as close a shave as Venus,"Although these are fairly decent in design, getting into most tight curves without nicking, they are truly cheap and are easily surpassed by the Venus razors that come with a couple of different lubricated pads. I enjoy the control these offer, but that's of little importance when it leaves stubble."
1,How to do Beadwork,I purchased this book directly from Amazon.com and based the purchase on its reviews. I was totally disappointed. This book is a reprint from a University of Michigan Library. It was written in 1908 and the information is totally outdated. Do not waste your money on this book.
3,classic magic book.,"This book contains many of the classic tricks we see in other books involving magic, thus not making it very different. On the other hand, the last chapter contains a section on stage illusions, which contains the methods behind How Houdini walked through a brick wall, how to make a piano disappear, and how to transport a person shot out of a cannon into a sealed container. An average book."
5,Great album,"This is a wonderful album mixing contemporary jazz and r&b. Two of the tracks are vocals, featuring two great R&B vocalists. Will Downing sings on ""A Dream of You"" and Vesta sings on ""...Or So you Thought"". Most of the tracks are originals, but there are a few r&b tracks, including a Stevie Wonder song that are given the jazz treatment. The first track ""I'm Coming Home"" is my favourite. It's got a great party atmosphere about it and you can't help but groove along. But the whole cd is excellent and I highly recommend it."
3,Funky (Or So You Thought),"Christian McBride proves once again that he is tremendous talent in the contemporary jazz world, demonstrating a great deal of technical virtuostiy and harmonic maturity on his third outing, ""A Family Affair."" The first track, the strongest on the record, swings hard, featuring thoughtful solos from all. It is unfortunate that this level of tastefulness does not persist throughout, however, for McBride's effort to move into a funk styling proves fatal. Why is it the fate of so many virtuosic bassists to embrace the ""cheese factor?"" I'd love for some one to explain this interesting phenomenon, as I am dumbfounded. Please give these guys a record by The Meters or The J.B.s . I'm sorry, but a wah pedal and a rehashed neo-soul drum groove just doesn't make good funk. McBride obviously knows his fusion and bop and is certainly an inspirational improviser. What he lacks is that certain greasy effe uuuu ennnnneeee kkkkkaaaaaaay...FUNK brotha..."
5,His best one?,I like this album best of all..the vocalists Vesta and Will Downing(never heard of them) really complement his music. Some of his albums are almost too lowkey for a guy who has tremendous rhythm and spirit...and huge talent.
5,Nursed By Verse . . .,Lobes hits one out of the park massaging heavy emotional obstacles into thoughtful and insightful verse. His words take us on a heartfelt journey through some of life's most challenging moments and lead us through a maze of conflict and discovery. He fearlessly faces the toughest of dilemmas and cathartically shares his pathway to peace. He uses his keen self-awareness as a tool to shine a light on our own road to resolution. He adds just enough whimsy to soften the more serious scenarios without compromising the richness and depth of the total experience. I highly recommend this book for those seeking a kind and gifted hand to guide them through self-reflection.
5,vhs instead of dvd,"i didn't read the description as well as i should have....disappointed, but not with the seller, just with myself. the vhs worked fine, but my husband asked me to get dvd."
2,POORLY CRAFTED,"I've dealt with many hammers, this is ok for PT student/intern if you would like to save money. Not the best constructed...."
5,Biting political/social commentary,"I've been reading Cox & Forkum for several months now via their website. I find their biting satire generally right on target and am frequently amazed at their ability to present complex political or philosophical positions with a single image.As Objectivists (see Allen Forkum's review) they clearly are capitalists and atheists, thus stating that they represent a fascist or Christian perspective is absurd - they champion a pro-reason, pro-egoism, pro-free market, pro-freedom perspective. I have NEVER found their work to be racist, bigoted, etc. and any representation to the contrary is simply false. Hate them if you must, but hate them for what they actually represent - not some ridiculous straw man.Bottom line - if you're a mindless leftist or right-wing religous zealot, you'll hate this book. If you are someone who cherishes reason, freedom and America, I highly recommend it."
5,It's about time!,"The artwork is awesome and the commentary is spot on!In a world were we are choking on the fumes and gas-baggery of the leftist editorial cartoonists, it is so refreshing to have a common sense/conservative voice publishing editorial commentary."
2,"One country, one faith, one race, one comic.","The title ""Black and White World II"" clearly illustrates how Cox & Forkum view the world: You are either a white Christian American; or you are one of the many stereotypes (arab/hippie/european/etc.) deserving of scorn and derision who is threatening the American way of life. Whether showing a musclebound Uncle Sam beating up an ""Islamist"", mocking the UN with a curious Al Jolson-style blackface depiction of Kofi Annan, blaming the failures of the Iraq war on Michael Moore, or justifying the latest round of Geneva Convention violations, Cox and Forkum echo the sentiments of President Bush when he said ""You are with us, or you are with the terrorists"". It's clear that their view of ""us"" is getting smaller and smaller by the day.Still, the book is a remarkable insight into the thinking in this country that led to G.W.Bush being reelected, and the general populace's inability to differentiate between Al Quaeda and Saddam Hussein."
2,A rehash of Jr.,"As far as I can see, this is just a collection of previously published articles, mostly from the pages of Card Player (TR) Magazine. If you must have them handy or have never seen most of his articles, then by all means get the book; but do not expect to learn much that is new."
3,"Interesting read, not a strategy book","This book is an interesting read of stories written by Phil and assorted other players. If you have some time to spend, enjoy poker and are not looking to develop your game this is a good read. Unfortunately, for any of you who subscribe to Card Player, or read articles, every one of these stories will be immediately recognizable to you as they are simply Phil's Card Player articles, published all together in a book. If you enjoy Phil's articles as I do, then the book is worth the purchase to have these articles all grouped together, but you may not want to buy if you will simply get frustrated at knowing all the stories already."
2,utterly forgettable,"this is strictly a ""read-it-at-Borders"" book. i give it two becausePhil is halfway amusing with his own curiously appealing egomania and it's sometimes an ok read: like reading USA Today--you read a few interesting things but nothing really sticks once you put the paper down. fast food for the mind."
1,Ego boost,"This is just an entire book for Phil Hellmuth, Jr. to drop names and make money bragging to everyone about his famous poker friends. Buy if you like hype, pass if you're looking for a book of real strategy and not Hellmuth patting himself on the back for the entire length of the book."
1,Terrible,This book was simply terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Unreadable. Please do not listen to reviewers who gave it five stars - if you look they give every book five stars. Terrible. Did I mention this book was terrible?
1,The Arrogant Phil Hellmuth,"I've been playing poker for many years and have watched Phil on TV a fare amount. After reading this book I do have to say that his reputation as a cry baby and snob is right on the mark. If you are interested in hearing Phil tell you how good a poker player he is and how he should never lose, this is the book for you."
1,Terrible. I wish I could put it into words,"I have a library of over 40 poker and gambling books and this one is without question the worst. It is page after page of Hellmuth politely putting down every player he has ever sat across from and re-hashing how great he is....over and over and over. It is almost laughable at times. There is no strategy, there are no redeeming qualities and it is nearly a waste of paper. Come on Phil, I know you are a sell out but this is crap. Anyone who knows poker (even his peers) does not give him much credit anyhow since he is a long term loser in the worlds biggest cash games. His game crumbles when the risk is 10 or 20 times higher than the WSOP and it is spendable money."
3,A decent read,"Doesn't really give much specific and applicable poker advice. Tells the story well though, it's a good read if you're reasonably knowledgable about poker."
1,Painful,"This book is painful to read. Unless you are a star-gazer who appreciates name-dropping, this book is simply about how the world gets lucky on Phil.People get lucky on me all the time, but I don't think it's an important book topic. In fact, I'd rather encourage poor play than discourage it, as this book feebly attempts to do.This book should be subtitled ""It's not my fault I am stuck on 9 bracelets! I swear!"" I sold my copy within weeks of buying it."
5,This book rocks!,"I have been living in the Bay area for almost 3 years and have had numerous books, most of which stink in comparison to this one. The vast amount of area that this book covers is great for doing just about anything in or around the Bay Area. I've probably utilized this book for more than 30 different activities (biking, hiking, camping, etc.) and I'd have to say that just about EVERYTHING that I've done was great and went smoothly because of the detail the book provides. The only bad thing I'd have to say is that the layout of the information is a bit confusing, but there are so many good ""activities"" in it that you get over that part quickly."
3,VERY GOOD,THE MAGIC TREE HOUSE THANKSGIVING ON THURSDAY IS GOOD I LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT THANKSGIVING ABOUT THE CINE OF FOOD THEY HEAD TO EAT AND THAT WE ERA VERE BLESS
1,why oh why do we lie,"is there some reason for the perpetuation of stereotypes? the story of squanto, the helpful noble savage. the story of indians selling their land for $24 in beads. does anyone really look into the validity behind these tales? since history books teach our young children enough lies about colonialism and the indigenous people in the Americas it is the duty of the parents to help stop these sometimes hurtful myths. do your kid a favor and quit lying to them about history. learn the truth."
2,Better books about Thanksgiving available,"The Magic Treehouse books are great for young readers to read independently. After they're done with one, they usually can't wait for the next. Unfortunately, the first Thanksgiving feast is treated in a rather superficial way. If you're just looking for another MT book, fine, go ahead and buy this..."
5,Love it,Saw this on cable and had to get book for our grandchildren. They will receive it this spring as gifts
2,"The good, the bad, the really bad customer service","I received this as a Christmas gift. Initially, it was fun going through the box and reliving the childhood memories the candy evoked. Then I hit a stale candy. Then another. There is nothing worse than biting into stale candy, unless it is the knowledge that someone paid a premium for it. (There's less than $10 worth of candy in a $40+ box, very little of it ""retro"", most of it hard candy.) I wrote to the company, and their response was essentially, ""gee, that's too bad."" They advised me to put the candy in the microwave to freshen it up. No other solution, as it's ""not their fault."" To sum up, some of the candy is good, some is really bad, and you'll never know which is which until it's in your mouth. I wouldn't buy from this company because they don't stand behind their product."
5,Street By Street Info and Unique Details,"Been to Adam four times before getting this book, it has excellent street by street maps with useful historical info and details. A very comprehesive and well written book, the restaurant and bar reviews were sopt on. Also includes info on cities and attractions outside of Ams. It helped make our 5th trip to Adam the best yet."
2,A hreavy paperback,"Although this book is compact it is too heavy to carry if one is on a walking tour. I can read a newspaper without glasses, but with glasses I had trouble with the type. It does not have an orderly format nor is there is a good section on hotels."
4,Only Know one Song on this CD,"I only got this for one song ""Little Green Bag"" because it is the longer 4 min.version. And it is in stereo,not like the LP version I had.All the songs where in stereo,but this track was in mono. I other songs I can do without."
4,Great book with a few issues.,"This was a great book and its obvious Gus has a knack for offensive strategy. After reading you will see why his Hurry Up offense is hard to stop, and why it can rack up the huge numbers even at the college level. The book was lacking in a few spots, the most glaring was the lack of proofreading. I usually have typos, so I am usually the last one to point out others grammar mistakes. However, I caught myself catching too many errors along the way in reading this book. I would like to see Gus do a 2nd version of this now that he has college ball under his belt and tell us what adjustments he has had to make since high school."
5,Must have...,"This is a must have for any Razorback fan. Guz simplifies this complex system. This book shows you how to truly control the game by setting an almost unbelievable pace, lengthening the game, and just good strategy."
4,Very Informative Read,I bought this book to learn more about x and o's after the college season ended. I loved the book very much.
5,we're going to beat you Phat Phil!,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!this is a great book- I suggest you get one for yourself.
5,Short Trip To Ireland,"I had the opportunity of hearing this group live on St. Paddy's Day and purchased their CD at the concert. My favorites on the CD are Cape Breton Reels, Blind Mary and the title of the CD, Cup Of Tea Medley. Sure to bring out the Irish in everyone! Very Happy Music. A pure delight and every Celtic music lover needs to include this CD in their collection."
5,Great CD,"I purchased this CD about a year ago, and I have been listening to it ever since. I was first introduced to Soul Ballet when a local smooth jazz station played ""Blu Girl,"" and I enjoyed that track so much I started looking for Soul Ballet music. This CD doesn't include that track, but has many other wonderful smooth jazz tunes (with only one song with very minimal lyrics). The tempo on most of the songs is very upbeat and energetic, and the music just gives you a great feeling when you hear it. I had never purchased anything by these artists before, so I was skeptical to buy the CD without prior knowledge of them, but it was a wise investment and never strays far from my CD player."
5,Nice earrings!,"Very nice earrings, and not too large of a hoop. Glad I purchased them! I was looking for a pair of earrings to match my ring, and these were the perfect fit."
5,52 inch fan review,"Great Fan, cost effective and the light kit included is very nice also. great value for the money, easy to put up, took about 2 hours."
4,Fan,"Bought this fan for a vacation condo. One plus about it is it can be installed with out needing a helper to hold the fan while making the wiring hookups due to a clever design in the ceiling bracket. Instructions are pretty clear and I had it up and running in a few hours. Doesn't come with light bulbs however, necessitating a return trip to the store. While I've only used it so far to see if it works I am impressed with the quietness of it while running. So far, so good!"
4,Ceiling Fan - A breeze to install,"I purchased six fans. After the first one, the install was a breeze. I installed all six in about six hours. The hanger system for holding the motor was a real time saver. If they took standard base bulbs, it would have been ideal."
4,"Terrible Instructions, Great fan","The instructions for assembly could not be worse in terms of clarity, but if you manage to get this thing assembled and installed, it functions very well."
2,Good looking...but a little flimsy and VERY NOISY,"When this fan first went up, I was very happy. Even though it didn't fit very snugly to the ceiling (not flush, the metal base hangs about 1/2 an inch) it was quiet and looks classy. I've only had it installed 6 weeks now and the motor gives off this LOUD hum that comes from cheap electric motors. In the past, my fans have made most of their noise from swinging back and forth, and that's what I was worried about...but now I know that cheap motors can be very noisy even if they don't swing from being imbalanced. It really bothers me because it's in my bedroom...if you're sensitive to noises while you sleep, you may want to spend a little more and get a higher quality fan.PROS:Attractive colorsEasy to installDual-sided blades for different finishesReversable motor for winter and summer operationCONS:Noisy electric motorNot the best fit"
3,"Like the fan, not happy with the fan blades","We were disappointed with the overall quality of the fan blades and the difficulty presented by Westinghouse in getting replacement of defective blades. Upon arrival of the fans, we had them installed, and found that each fan had one chipped blade. We immediately contacted Westinghouse via email, but then had to go through alot of red tape to have anyone contact us. The first contact made from customer service indicated we should return the fans since the blades we had just received a couple of weeks before were no longer available. Since the fans were already installed at great time and expense, that was not an option. They eventually sent all replacment blades, but after alot of hassle.We always check customer feedback before ordering online, and since there was good feedback we opted to order via Amazon. Hope all people choose to return this survey to avoid similar frustrations."
5,ceiling fan,great fan and good value. reversible blades. Good airflow and fan also reverses direction.
3,Economical,"When we installed this ceiling fan, the light switch didn't work so we had to order a replacement switch to install. Since then, the unit is working fine.For the price, it still is more than worth the trouble."
3,Very little wind production evev at the highest speed,"I kid you not this thing looks beautiful, its quiet like hell and not even a shimmy of movement while it is in use. It is perfectly balanced,I recommend the manufacture adjust the blade for more wind output its poor. I had cheap no name brand fans give-out more breeze than that. Shift all in all it is a good bye just works better if you have a central or ductless unit."
1,disappointed,"I was so disappointed with these fans. I carefully read the specifications to be sure the light kit used standard base bulbs. I'm not returning them because I had already paid for them to be installed before I realized they had candlarabra(sp) based bulbs. I just checked the specs again and they have been changed since I ordered a few days ago (they no longer say standard base bulbs). I guess part of it is my fault for not double checking them before having them installed, but I didn't expect them to be different than what I had read in the specs when I ordered them."
1,Poor Quality Blades,"I bought 3 of these fans, thinking I was getting a good price...I should he just gone to Home Depot and paid a little more. Actually...with shipping costs, a nice fan I picked up myself would have cost the same.The blades are ugly pressboard with ""paper wood tone"" that peals off...worst of all is the sides of the blades that are painted with this ungly silver paint that just rubs off when you touch it. The globes are ribbed and frosted and just look cheap.It barely puts out any light because you have to use the small 40 watt bulbs you usually only see in desk lampsThe pulls for the light and the fan look like chep ""play"" coins a child would have....However, the fan itself works well.Don't buy this fan if you want quality."
1,never enough information,"Having purchased thousands of dollars of stuff from amazon, I am sorely disappointed in information given. My ceiling has a slight tilt and all of my experience with ceiling fans they have a way to adjust the fit but not this one. I also bought a kitchen dome lamp with a 13 watt bulb but the bulb is a specialty bulb and requires an expensive and difficult 3 prong plug. Both will go to my local thrift store. A previous purchase of a 42 inch tv was advertised with[..]rebate but when it arrived, the ""rebate"" was paper sports junk. I am very leery of buying from amazon now and will only buy books and small items."
5,Excellent Ceiling Fan,"We purchased one of these fans nine months ago for our son's bedroom because of its low height and reasonable price. We have been very happy with the fan. It blends very nicely with the white ceiling, making it barely noticeable. It is quiet, but displaces quite a bit of air. We like it so much that we just purchased another one for our bedroom."
4,Great Fan for the price,"This is a great little fan for the price; the motor seems to be of good quality, the installation was fairly easy, and the fan works great. My only 2 complaints are that the fan housing cover (the silver thing at the base of the fan) wasn't quite round, so it was difficult to get on without tearing off the rubber shims that help prevent noise, AND the fan didn't go as fast as I had thought it would on high speed, but it is quiet and does still move air! A similar fan would cost you over $100 at the Big Orange Box Store."
4,not as spiffy,"It's not as spiffy looking when just the light is on, but the light is nice and bright and the fan works well. No problem installing it. Actually it would look even spiffier with the fan on if the blades matched the frame instead of being transparent, but it's very nice, also it's of necessity here very close to a skylight and I love that it doesn't block it."
4,Very good - specially for the price,"I went ahead and purchased 4 of this fans. I have to say that they are very easy to install. The only problem I had with all 4 of them, is that two ""leather"" tapes that are supposed to go between the mount and the main cover are imposible to keep in place. This is mainly because this type of leather tape is glued to the mount, and it will move when installing the protective cover that goes outside and protects the mount and the motor. I had to remove both tapes in all the fans in order to finish installation (picture was added).Other than that I have to say that the fan is very quiet and it's doing what is supposed to do very well. I will update this comment if necessary."
4,nice fan for the price,I bought two of these fans because the ones in the house I purchased were too small for the room. These look good and they are very quiet when operating. The only negative is that the fan blades seem a little narrow.
1,MAKE SURE THEY SEND RIGHT ONE!!!,"I'm remodeling a number of condominiums and when i received these fans, I simply gave them to my contractor. When I went to look at the job, I saw a mixture of fans, including brass units and 44"" units. They were already hung and the boxes had been thrown out. I was really upset, but there was nothing I could do. They don't look great, but it is now too expensive to remedy."
2,A Mickey Mouse item that pretends to be a permanent household fixture,"Nothing in the website description says that it cannot be mounted on a vaulted ceiling nor on a rod. The whole unit must be flush with the ceiling. Otherwise, it doesn't work. The attachment points for the blades are straight bolted on and does not use rubber washer - careful not to over tighten, you'll ruin the finish of the blades. The frosted glass light covers do not have rubber mounting rings. So, you have to get the metal screws to force onto the glass surface itself. Again, careful not to over tighten. The parts are needlessly heavy yet the motor was somewhat small. This is a serviceable fan for the limited budget and limited time. But get a Hunter fan if you want a real fixture that lasts."
3,Cutting short Arrau is an affront,"Maestro Arrau was a wholly musical artist.Presenting a segmented Arrau is unacceptable because it would have been an open personal affront to him.He worshiped Beethoven and would have never ever tolerated the ""nightmare"" of having to play only ""the third movement of a Beethoven concerto""!His conception of a concerto was that of an integrated, profound work of art, encompassing intricate developments of serious human endeavours.Would anyone submit to admire only the bottom 1/3 section of a Michelangelo?Let's not abuse Arrau for selling purposes!No, thank you."
1,BEWARE!,"If you are expecting a real version, buyer beware. The version I received through Amazon was not a real US copy, but rather the ""Eastern Economy Edition"". It was a ""photo-offeset reproduction"" which is legally for sale only in Bangledesh, Burma, etc. You can purchase these on E-bay for a fraction of what I was charged. It is a black and white version only, so pictures and graphs intended for color are much harder to read. Since it is basically a photocopy of the original, even the text is harder to read than it should be.Either get the real version or get it cheaper."
5,Very insightful,"Excellent and well laid out. Keeps you interested by adding humour and good key learning points at the end of each chapter.I used mine for my MBA, but plan to return to reading it again."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased the book online and paid for expedite services, I really was disappointed on the late arrival of the book. When I purchased the book online it state hardcover, I instead got papercover."
2,Not Really New,"I bought this book, received it quickly and had written a gread review, but then when I moved into Chapter Fifteen, the book had been highlighted by someone using orange and yellow highlighters--obviously the book wasn't new like the seller claimed. I thought I bought a new book, when really I had purchased a used one that had been taken good care of. DON'T REPRESENT YOUR ITEMS AS NEW IF THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT!!!"
1,Messed up Book,"Got about 50 pages into this book, when it jumped ahead about 200 pages. I thought that maybe they would just be out of order, but they weren't. Just missing. I still really want to read this book, but after I sent it back to the publisher, I'm scared to reorder."
2,Not quite what I was expecting,"I probably didn't interpret the photo of this item correctly... because I was expecting magnets that looked like actual pills only slightly larger than life size, like maybe the size of an in-shell peanut and a bottle cap. But these are flat magnets with photos of pills, and very large, which also makes them less funny, in my opinion. They're okay as is, but I wouldn't have ordered them if I'd understood what I was getting. I debated about posting this review, because although I'm not happy with my order, it's not exactly the fault of the item. But then I thought someone else might be thinking the same thing, that these were ""3-D"" magnets, and be glad to hear my story."
3,"Good idea, not a great implementation","Overall this case was ok, but it was way too snug and partially covered the bottom of the click wheel. I was using with a 2nd Gen Nano so that might be the reason. I returned it and decided to go with the Core Cases Nano case instead, and I've never looked back."
4,Better for a shelf queen,This skid plate looks great and fits well. I think its much better suitedFor a shelf queen than a basher/racer. The anodized aluminumIs great looking but bends very easy. Iv had to pull mine off andBend it syraight many times now. As a basher ill go with RPM next time.
4,Excellent,Great quality. Heavy Pyrex glass in several sizes. The lids fit great. This set has 1 extra small bowl that will not stack with the others so it looks like you have 1 odd item in your cabnet but aside from that they are nice. This should have been a 16 piece set and then everything would store better.A overall
2,Arrived damaged,"This is a multi-piece pyrex bowl and lid set. Of the 9 bowls, one arrived with a chip on the edge, leaving a sharp edge. We discarded it.If we had bought it locally, I suppose I would have exchanged it."
1,No 3-cup bowls,The current description for this set included three-cup bowls. There are none. It is three two-cup bowls along with the two four-cup and two seven cup. Nothing is wrong with the set if that's what you want. It isn't what I wanted. I unpacked it all before I realized it.
1,arrived totally crashed,"First arrived with broken rim of the largest bowl, so that customer service said send a new one.Finally, I got that with opened pyrex box not outer amazon box, and a inner bowl was totally crashed.It was too dangerous to pull out so that I had to cut the box with scissors. Because everywhere in the box, there were tiny chips all over the box! I have pictutres of that. Also I got hurts that tiny chips what can't see into my fingers when I opened it!I am really upset because I have a doubt they sent a non-sealed box(crashed product inside)on purpose for replacement. If not, why they sent a opened box looks like some using it?Amazon.com needs to say something!"
4,good deal for some needed storage containers,These were on sale so i'm snatched them up. I like Pyrex products. Only issue I guess I could say is like the silicone top containers a little better.
3,Great buy,"The product is great, love using the glass to keep food in and microwave in also. The one downfall with this product is one of the tops to the largest container does not fit. I realized this after a month of owning the product so I can not return it. Buy it, just make sure that all the lids fit!"
5,LOVE it.,I love this set and it was a bargain. I'm replacing all plastic in my kitchen and this is a very economical way to do it. Not to mention that they are very attractive nicely shaped bowls.
5,The Best Option,"I replaced my BPA containers with these after trying some non-BPA plastic a few months ago. Glass is the way to go and I was happy enough to buy some more. Yes, some of the lids are a little tight, but I'm glad they seal up well, so it's tolerable. Definitely a far better value than plastic!"
5,Wonderful!,Just what I needed. Food is sealed tight and kept fresh. I can finally keep my refrigerator organized and safe from messy spills and leaks. Loved everything about this product!
4,"Pyrex is safe, non-toxic and effective!","It's a bowl, a piece of tupperware, and a to-go container! These containers are microwave-safe, non-toxic, and convenient. They stack easily in my refrigerator and can go in the dishwasher. Even the lids usually do not let liquid escape (but if I'm taking the tupperware to work, then I'll wrap it in a plastic bag).Basically, if you have leftovers and you're tired of being creeped out by your plastic containers that may or may not be leaching BPA into your food, this is the set for you!Furthermore, the 18-piece set is perfect for 2 people. You only really get 9 containers (the 18 pieces refers to the containers and the lids) and because we make all sorts of dressings in addition to cooking all the time, I have been known to use almost all 9 pieces at once.The only cons of this product: the containers are relatively heavy and not totally leak-proof."
5,Excellent Storage Solution,"This Pyrex Storage set is excellent in every sense. We wanted to get away from plastics and from odd shaped containers. We are so pleased that we intend to buy another set and replace some of our glass containers. We already moved out nearly all of our plastic storage.The Pyrex stores easily in the cupboard and when put in the refrigerator is easy to organize. The clear glass allows us to see what is inside without removing the lid. The glass is a heavy gauge, sturdy construction and we have yet to break any of them.The plastic lids are great and now we don't have to always get out the plastic wrap to cover leftovers that we store in the refrigerator.In addition to getting another set for ourselves we are considering buying at least two more sets as Christmas gifts for family members."
2,Received 17 items!,The product is good. It's just that i received 17 items instead of 18. The 2-cup bowl is missing a lid!
2,boxed items missing two mid size lids and one bowl chipped,"dissapointed because of the chip on one of the larger glass bowls. in addition, one second to smallest lid is missing. finally, two of the smallest bowls had to be thrown out becuase i could not pull them apart. what a waste. in reality, with all these problems added together, i only received 14 pieces."
4,"good product, tight lids","The product arrived on time and as ordered. Exactly what I wanted, except that the lids are quite stiff and snug and sometimes difficult to put onto the container. But overall very satisfied."
2,Disappointed in Amazon's Packing,I had to return them because one of the bowls was SHATTERED. Amazon should do a better job of packing glass items. I will probably not purchase any glass items again from Amazon. I have since bought the pyrexbowls in town and I like them except that they get extremely hot when used in the microwave. Make sure you use hot pads. The covers fit tightly and they stack well in the refrigerator.
1,Don't Buy This!,I have never taken the time to write a review online but felt a need to say that I received this order and I could only get the lids on 2 of the 9 tupperware containers. It's too much of a pain to return it with all the packaging so I'm just eating the cost but wanted to spare anyone else out there the trouble. You'd think that the Pyrex name would product you from a bad product but it doesn't!
4,Okay overall...,"This storage set is okay. The lids are tough to put on / take off, but all in all, the storage set serves its purpose. If you're not careful when washing / handling, the glass may chip a little at the rim. But I suppose anyone should be careful when handling glass. Hands down, it still beats storing food in plastic containers. Maybe it's psychological, but food just tastes better in glass."
1,Arrived Broken - TWICE,"Although I've seen this product in stores and it seems very nice, ordering it from Amazon is a mistake. There is not enough padding inside the set's box to withstand being shipped, and Amazon only put a few pieces of air padding on 2 sides of the box. After filing a complaint and sending the set back, my replacement set arrived with even less padding and even more shattered pieces. Spend a little more and buy it locally to avoid this hassle."
3,Some of the bowls had slight cracks,"and one of the bowls had a jagged edge. Even though 3 of the bowls had some problems I was pleased overall. If not for the small cracks and jagged edged bowl I would have given a 5 star rating. The bowls are great for storing leftovers, reheating in the microwave and transporting food. The lids fit very tight so you don't have to worry about spills. Plus, I like being able to glance in the fridge and see what's in each bowl."
3,Lids are difficult to close,"I bought this as an alternative to using plastic tupperware. I don't know if the product they sent me was defective, or this is just the nature of the design. The lids were very very hard to close so I ended up returning it."
4,It's Pyrex,"No complaints expect that the lids are a little tight. None of my other Pyrex purchases are like this. I can deal with it, but just throwing it out there. -1 star for that."
5,Good set,"Very functional set, quality product. The lids aren't the best design but they work. I never use plastic Tupperware anymore."
3,A very good idea,"I ordered this set plus a 10 piece pyrex set with the vented lids. You may prefer the vented lids -- which I understand will fit this set, if we can find a way to just buy the lids. This set has the handier smaller sizes for prep, dips, and small quantities of leftovers, which is nice.I was surprised to open my box and find not all 18 pieces (I was missing 2 lids) so definitely do an inspection once yours arrive! There is a 1-800# for Corning in the package insert, and they are sending me the missing lids with no problem, so I am saved the hassle of re-packaging and shipping back for a refund.I am looking forward to making the total switch from plastic to glass. Good for the environment, and our health!"
4,Product description needs correction,"My set arrived without broken glass or missing lids, unlike reported by other reviewers, but shoppers should know that both the ""product description"" and ""product features"" here are mistaken: the set contains 3 2-cups dishes, and no 3-cups dishes."
3,"Great for storage, but not for everyday use","I prefer pyrex storage over other food containers, and like this set for pantry use. But I don't like this set for everyday storage, and heating and handling of leftovers because the bowls have straight, smooth sides with no lip and they easily slip from wet hands."
5,Great Purchase,I am so glad I finally bought these. I do not miss my plastic containers at all. The lids do fit tightly but this is good--you don't have to worry about liquids leaking.
4,Versatile and elegant Tupperware alternative,"You might be hesitant to use glassware for everyday food storage. But Pyrex is different: It's thick and extremely difficult to break. Also, it's not only microwave-safe, it's even oven-safe (just take off the lid!). The only flaw is that the lids are difficult to put on at first. This takes practice, two hands, and a lot of pressure."
5,"Great product, Great value, Great to use!","We love those bowls.They are easy to wash, easy to open and close, the lids fit snugly and securely (can hold liquid w/o leaks),the bowls are robust (pyrex) and the lids are also robust (i.e. won't crack in a year of usage).Original reason for buying: eliminate plastic chemical leeching into our food.Unless you store your bowls upside down with food in it, the food does not touchany plastic.I'm just ordering my second batch of 18 pieces to fully replace our zip-lock plastic food storagecontainers. I'll use them to store screws and nails instead :-)"
4,Good,"but not great-bowls are good quality glass but the tops are a pain to secure on.But well worth what I paid for them-good stacking,packing and transferring bowls-my freezer has never looked so organized-lol.I also own the square set-same issue-the tops are a real pain to get on and in no way would I put them in the dishwasher-they hardly fit as it is and Im pretty sure if I dishwashered them Id never get them on the bowls."
5,"Way better than ""tupperware""!","I bought these because of all of the reports about plastics leaking into your food when you microwave plastic containers. Best purchase ever! The variety of sizes are perfect. The lids fit very tight, which is great when you're transporting soup as I often do in the winter. I use them almost daily!"
4,Pyrex Storage Bowls,"I really love the ability to store food in glass containers . I like all the sizes availible in this set, but the covers are too small and rigid. I cannot get on or off. Even my 6' 3"" 200 lb son had a difficult time with them. Perhaps, Pyrex should revisit their Corelle line and make the covers like those...Deb"
4,The Pyrex is Half Full,"We are really happy with our Pyrex set. The sizes are just right for a variety of leftover types and stack together nicely (except for the one size with an extra piece, which is somewhat of a straggler in the storage area). The tops are tight and fitted to curve around the edges of the glass, so you have to kind of work them on to seal them. Despite this, they aren't exactly leak proof - the only reason I'm not giving 5-stars. I haven't had any major spills but when I use them to bring leftovers to work it is absolutely necessary to put them in a plastic bag during the commute. We haven't tried heating them yet/using them for hot liquids, but the glass appears thick enough to handle hot soup and they are supposed to be microwave safe. Also, please note that ""18 piece"" means the 9 containers and 9 lids, not 18 containers (we knew this but thought some people might misinterpret the product name...)"
3,It leaks over time,"At first it seemed to be great keeping fluids in but just like other food storage containers, they leak. I'd like for once to have ""tupperware"" that doesn't leak, especially pyrex. Other than that, I do like them. I've recently dropped a couple and banged them into things without the dishes breaking so I do like the sturdiness. Best used at home (not to travel) or with foods that have no juices whatsoever."
5,Love it for work lunches,"No more hauling around of used, cruddy, hard to clean, easily lost plastic ware. I'm very happy with this purchase."
4,Utilitarian and great looking.,"Not only are the bowls perfect for storing items in the fridge or freezer, they also make the interior of the units look unified and attractive."
4,Great find,"These pyrex bowls are easy to wash, easy to stack and great to use for storing and keeping food fresh.The bottoms wash easily in the dishwasher and the tops can be firmly secured to keep the contents airtight."
5,Very happy with these bowls,"I am very happy with my purchase. I wanted these for two reasons. When I cut up fruits and veggies I want to be able to see what I have. Also, I worry about heating up leftovers in plastic containers. Great for both!"
5,One of the staples of my kitchen,"I have almost every shape and size of these. They go from oven, to table, to fridge or freezer, to microwave. They store neatly in the refrigerator and you can see clearly what you have in there. No more funky plastic taste on food. Wash out clean, no stains. Friends (other moms) come over and always ask where I found them. Environmentally friendly and a great bargain - especially considering the longevity. Obviously I can't say enough great things about these dishes!"
5,Came through on the second try,"For $20, I feel much better about putting leftovers in these for warming up than the plastic-ware that has gotten so popular. Even better - in this set, there are some very small sized containers that are useful for cooking preperation and pouring sauces and other liquids for dipping bread/chips/whatever in at the table. I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,Great Glass storage with Pyrex,"I read recently that plastic is unsafe to use in the microwave and so decided to switch to glass. These pyrex storage containers are great! They are a nice thick glass, very sturdy and versatile, going from fridge to microwave or oven. The tops are plastic, but very nice thick plastic, not the brittle kind. They do not stack super easily, but I feel much safer feeding my family and warming up meals."
4,Great Storage,"Great for storage in the fridge, just beware when you heat up in the microwave, have a napkin or pot holder ready!"
4,A great value!,"I really like these food storage containers. I have been trying to ""go green"", so I needed something to store leftovers in, without using plastic wrap, or tinfoil. Also I don't want to heat up leftovers in plastic containers anymore. The set has two drawbacks. One is the sizes ( 2 are really small), and the second is you can't stack the same size bowls together. They get stuck tight. But I'm still very glad I bought them and am happy with the purchase. A great value!"
5,great storage!,"The Pyrex storage set is a great set. Pyrex definetely lives up to their name with this set. The glass is thick/heavy, and doesn't feel like it will break very easily when you pile dishes in the sink. The lids make a tight fit. I filled one up with water, turned it upside down, and it didn't leak...what more can you ask for."
5,great set of bowls,"We love these dishes. Nice variety of sizes for leftovers, salads, side dishes or whatever size need you have. Very sturdy. Nice tight fitting lid that are easy to secure and remove. Goes from freeze or fridge to microwave to table. Clear, so it's easy to tell what is in your fridge without having to open anything. Small sizes are great for packing in lunches."
5,Love these!!!,"We ditched all our plastic containers and got 2 sets of these Pyrex dishes instead. They are wonderful! You can see what your leftovers are in the fridge, they go from fridge to microwave to table easily and the lids go on perfectly and seal tightly. I love how tidy our cabinet is now that we don't have all those mismatched plastic containers everywhere! These stack/nest easily and the lids are easy to grab too; no wasting time searchiing for a matching lid like before. THRILLED with this set!"
5,Good value,This the second or third set of Pyrex storage containers that I have purchased. I have been using Pyrex storage containers for over a year and I have been very pleased. The lids are tight. We store leftovers or frozen items in the Pyrex. The food does not dry out. There is never any plastic odor. The Pyrex stacks easily in the refrigerator. It is easy to see exactly what is inside. I put the lids under the container when storing the Pyrex in the cupboard and put the smaller sizes inside the larger. I like Pyrex and this set is very useful and a good value.
5,Plenty of storage,"I was afraid the lids wouldn't fit as mentioned here however they fit tightly. Instead of trying to cover the whole container at once place the lid on one side and push on the line near at the opposite edge it always works and you don't have to heat the lid. I used to get plastic ones and put them in the trash after they got old, a lot of waste. These containers do not retain odors, it is nice to have different sizes, I use them for storage, mixing, and preparing food, have bought 4 sets so far."
4,Mine arrived broken,"Received timely, but one of the two large bowls was chipped badly along the rim...Amazon is shipping out replacement the same day as received...I would like to note that before the gold box price of twenty three dollars, the regular price was at thirty four dollars...Now all of a sudden,the regular price is three dollars less than the offered gold box price from a few days ago...Someone is messing with the prices?"
4,Glass storage dishes,"These are versatile, sturdy dishes for storing food in the refrigerator or freezer. They can be moved from the freezer to the microwave or a cold oven with no problem(remove the lids first). I like the size selection. I will probably purchase more of these later."
3,Pyrex aint what it used to be!,"I love the functionality of these containers but am disappointed in how delicate they are. They chip very easily. I have been buying pyrex products for years and these just don't meet the quality standards that I am used to. Unfortunately, i haven't found any other new pyrex containers that are as sturdy as the old ones."
2,Tired of Plastic,"After years of using tupperware and leftover plastic bowls, I decided to purchase the pyrex. At first I was happy with the bowls and lids. Nothing gets burned into them, goes from frige to oven to freezer. I have had these for 3 months and now I am finding chips around the edges of the bowls. I have no idea how they are getting that way. They are carefully used, washed and put away neatly when not in use. Not happy at all. I think I'll be starting my plastic collection of mis-matched storage bowls again."
1,Not Freezer Safe and a Health Hazard,"Having used this glassware for several weeks without any issues, I used them to store items in the freezer. About a week later I started taking the frozen containers out of the freezer and they would shatter randomly. Sometimes I would try and take the lid off and the container would shatter, other times it would shatter when I placed it on a dry countertop. I cannot recommend these items at all because of the danger they pose with all of the glass shards being around food and in the kitchen. They were great products until they started breaking during normal use."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought these less than a year ago because I wanted to switch all my containers from plastic to glass, and I loved that these were made in the US (at least the glass, not the lids). All I can say now, is don't waste your money. These ALL chipped, and NOT by being dropped. Just by sitting in a drawer and being stacked, they all started chipping at the rims and I have to throw them all away because there are tiny little ""shavings"" of glass inside them. Great concept, but very disappointing."
5,Love it,"Exactly what I needed. I was so tired of plastic containers that get hotter than the food!Look just like the photo, wash in dishwasher is perfect tolo!"
1,"Bad Packaging, Chipped Product, Missing Lid...","Pyrex product itself is great, but it's unfortunate that the packaging sucks. Of the 9 glass bowls, 5 had either chips or a crack on the outer lid portions. Big pieces of glass fell from the package when I first opened it which surprised me. Another problem was a missing lid.I guess this is the chance I took ordering a glass product through the internet."
1,Poorly fitting lids,I was very disappointed with the product. The lids were difficult to get onto the glass and I could not fit two of them on at all. The lid design is not good. I've loved Pyrex for other items but not this one.
2,Lid closing and opening problems,"OK the glass is nicer than plastic, no doubt, but the lids re a nightmare. NOT good for elderly. Very difficult to close - and not so easy to open. especially the round containers."
5,Great Product!,"This is a great storage set. Very sturdy. I've accidentally dropped it many times and it didn't break. I use it to store my lunch everyday and heat it up in the microwave. Before, I would use plastic tupperware and it would eventually get warped and stained from being microwaved all the time. Also, I never got into the habbit of washing my tupperware after using it at work--the leftover food would just stick to the tupperware and stain it. WIth the pyrex, I just soak it in water once I get home and everything comes right off. The bigger pieces are also great for storing left over dinner, which then can be reheated in the microwave without having to transfer it to another microwave-proof dish. I use these everyday. This set will last me a long time. It is definitely worth every penny."
5,cozy anthology,"You will relish all these stories like tasty morsels. Chicago Sun TimesEsteemed mystery writer Anne Perry...heads up a delectable cast of writers, the very best from both sides of the Atlantic. from the back cover"
1,"Very poorly written book, confusing, and a waste","I thought the book was very poorly written. First , it was disorganized and very difficult to understand, second, it did a very poor job of explaining anything. The author explained doing the to do list to death, but forgot to ever explain how to do a web page with front page. Later in the book he went to great length to explain the comands to use with certain things, without ever letting you know what those things did, and what it was he was talking about. After I read it and learned nothing, I loaned it to a friend who is very up on computers, and wanted to learn Front Page. He gave it back a few hours later and said he couldn't understand what the author was talking about."

5,Great option for a low price,"This is the third unit of this kind I have purchased, the other two are in vehicles. This is a great inexpensive option for having satellite radio through a receiver. We have a whole house sound system, and after totaling a car with an XM contract we wanted an inexpensive way to finish the contract and be able to listen at home. The Xpress is nothing fancy, but it doesn't need to be! Enjoy ease of listening and trouble free installation."

3,Good early middle school tale,"Felita is a tween caught between her own changing emotions, her desire to be free, like her brothers, and her very protective mother. It is the second book in a series, but stands alone."
1,Going home,"this book was written by Nichola Mohrshe was born in a poor family,then when she was4years old she went to school on new york city.then when she was 15 she graduates from high school.her life was terrible they didn't has any money.one day she decided to writes books when she was 18 years old she get started to make some changes in the family.Nicholasa Mohr is a good author she was a famous author in new york city.she has written many books by the time she was 30years old.she still written book now."
5,I Sleep Well With This Sleep Mask.,"I like this magnetic sleep mask better then the last magnetic sleep mask I had because it's adjustable, comfortable, durable and has better quality magnets."
2,Doesn't really do anything for morning headaches.,It's a good eye mask for blocking the light and pretty soft but the magnets really don't do anything to take away headache pain which is why I bought it... I had a feeling that was what would happen but I still use it to block the light. It is adjustable so that my husband can use it too when taking naps.
3,nice and comfortable - overall OK,feels nice and comfortable to wear. and it covers the eyes well. but as for the magnets ... I'm not so sure. certainly does not help with migraines - not even regular headaches - just does nothing for them - at all.
2,Does Not Block out light/Hurts Ridge Of Nose,"It's good quality but when I first received the mask I thought it looked cheap for all that money I spent. I don't know how the magnets work or how they make you feel. I basically bought it for sleeping. It does not block out light! It also pressed too hard up against the ridge of my nose and left a mark on my nose for hours after I took the mask off the front of my face. I even tried reversing mask to see if light would stay out that way, it did not. The only way I did get it to block the light is to fold back the nose part inward and kind of arch it up. I bought a different eye mask and currently do not use this one but I do still want to see if the magnets work."
3,for my 9 year old son...,"Was OK. It is easy to read and improved his game. But, some of the diagrams are confusing. Good buy."
4,A positional books for novices (1000-1400,"I consider myself a class C player. I am familiar with most of the concepts in this book and solve most of the problems, but there are still some I missed, and still diagrams where Pandulfini provides better analysis than what I thought of.I do think it is accessible to Class E, but he does not spend any time talking about the importance of controlling files or making forks or pins. Instead, he just shows situations where you can make these stronger or neutralize your opponents attempt to do so.For me it is a fast, easy read, but well worth it."
4,Pandolfini's best book,truth be told this was the first chess book I ever had. I didn't understand it at all and thought it was boring. Once I started playing club chess I reread it and thought it was excellent.Particularly Bruce is eager to teach us the ideas of pawn structure and WHY it is important. His work on the isolated pawn is essential and I will be refreshing on soon.If you are under 1600 or you just want a solid stragety book than buy this book!
1,Mediocre book,"Pandolfini is capable of writing decent books. His columns in 'Chess Life' are not bad. Unfortunately he chooses not to exert himself, or perhaps his publishers pressure him to churn 'em out."
5,Mesmerising music,"This CD from Bobby McFerrin is so far removed from his Don't Worry, Be Happy days that most people wouldn't know it was him. The music is absolutely wonderful, perfect as amazing background music for an evening of chilling out. The chantlike songs flow into one another and you can easily put the CD on repeat and not even realise it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes meditative music."
3,Good sampling of Cajun Music,"At least 1/2 the songs are in French, so if you don't speak it you'll not understand the words. I enjoyed most of the songs but ony a couple really stood out for me. I had hoped John Fogerty would be on more than the one song, so I was disappointed in that."
2,mediocre,"I love Cajun music and many of the artists on here (Patty Griffin, Maria McKee and others). Still, I think this disc is rather a yawn. It's nearly all in French and most of the singers don't ""do"" French well. The music is not nearly as varied as Cajun music can be and tends to all run together. I have sold mine back."
4,"Correction regarding ""Jolie Blonde""","I thought this album was lovely with haunting songs, especially Patty Griffin's ""Pa Janvier, Laisse Moi M'en Aller,"" and Anne Savoy & Linda Ronstadt's ""La Chanson d'une Fille de Quinze Ans."" A correction of an earlier review by someone else: Jolie Blonde"" does indeed make its appearance on this album, under the title of ""Ma Blonde Est Partie."" Different title, same melody!"
1,Wish I'd Read the Reviews First!,I absolutely agree with the majority of the reviews. The saw stopped making noise after the first time I tested it and my 2 year-old son had it dismanteled within minutes of seeing it (which is much faster than it took me to assemble it!). I bought a second one to replace the saw piece and that worked for about 1 day's worth of play. Needless to say both workshops went back to the store. If Bob the Builder is your toy of choice - go with the Bob the Builder Duplo sets - much more fun!
4,Use Your Judgement.,"My 4 year old loves this toy. However, it does not stay together very well. I think this may be intentional to fit in with the ""building"" theme and it does not bother my son in the least that the pieces easily come apart. I would not recommend this toy for a 2 year old as the manufacturer does."
3,Super glue saved the day,I concur with what everyone else wrote. We tossed the useless stick things that go in the corners. Tossed the roof. And superglued the wall corners together so now the walls stay put and the doors don't pop off. My little guys enjoy playing with this and now I don't have the headache of constantly reattaching walls and doors. Magnetic Bob prompts the playset to talk in his show voice and lights come on and saws start spinning. So get that glue and boost this playset from one star to three!!!!
3,Not bad for a non-Fisher Price toy,"My son received this for his 2nd birthday. Even though he's not familiar with Bob, he likes the sounds and lights that he can make come on by moving Bob around the workshop. I found that it stays together nicely if I don't try to open the workshop on the side (as the picture of the toy shows.) It's not as sturdy as a Fisher Price toy, but it's not cheaply made either. I think the magnetic blocks/bricks/wood that comes with it are a great educational feature."
2,Not the best quality toy.,"I purchased this toy for my twin boys who love Bob the Builder. This toy only frustrates them because it falls apart so easily. I would have thought that they should be able to play independently with it, but they kept saying that it broke and I had to come in and fix it. I have purchased other Bob the Builder toys in the ""Take Along"" category and found that the quality was just not there. I wouldn't recommend this toy."
1,Broke in 10 minutes!,"My son got this for his third birthday. It took 10 minutes to put it together and it fell apart when I was putting it on the floor for him to look at. The saw stopped making cutting noises and when I called the manufacturer they said that was a ""common problem"" and didn't have any in stock to replace it because they had sent out too many for holiday replacements. That was a huge red flag. It's been two weeks - the walls fall off, the saw still doesn't work, the roof is broken... And my son had played with it all of about 3 times. Don't waste your money!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This toy is a piece of junk and for $25, definitely not worth the money. It falls apart at the slightest jiggle and takes more time to put together than it does to fall apart. The concept of the toy is cute, but with it falling apart so easily, my son loses interest in it quickly."
1,What a waste of a toy!,"My son got this toy for his 3rd birthday after I told his aunt he was into Bob the Builder. It would not stay together for 5 minutes and there were a ton of different little pieces-! Don't waste you money, I am on my way to return it to Target right now."
2,Horrible,"I agree with everything above. I can't believe how bad this thing is at staying together. I was going to put it in the box until my son was older, but then I saw it was a 2+ toy and he's already two. He likes the little Bob toy and Muck, but the storage thing together is useless, he keeps bringing me different doors to put back on and they don't stay!!! Save your money and get something else.If this wasn't a gift, I would have returned it as well."
2,Save your little Bob fan a truckload of aggravation,"My 2 1/2 year old son is a big Bob fan, and when I first heard about the 'click bricks' idea, I thought it would be great for toddlers and preschoolers. Not so. Only certain areas of each brick are magnetic, and they don't fit together in any intuitive way. We've got this set and the expansion pack at the same time. It's impossible to build the structures you see on the box using the magnetic points as anchors, so basically you're just piling bricks on top of each other that will fall over at the slightest touch. That makes it pretty frustrating for a toddler who wants to do something as simple as opening a door so Bob or Wendy can go into a building. This toy was a big disappointment. On the bright side, he can play with the Bob and Wendy figures in our Fisher Price house, and we've been building Duplo houses for them. Unless you want to deal with a frustrated and disappointed toddler, I'd recommend avoiding these sets!"
2,poorly made,My son received this toy for his 2nd birthday. He loves Bob the Builder. However when assembled this toy will not stay together it is very poorly constructed if you are used to the durability of the little people toys you will be very dissapointed with this. However my son loves to play with it but gets very frustrated because it falls apart. If he hadn't received it as a gift I would take it back and get my $ back.
3,Great Help,"This program is used at my son's school, I purchased it to practice at home and found that it really has helped prepare him and increase his fluency level. As long as I make sure he tracks his reading, and doesn't just memorize, it has helped him learn to read."
3,Good supplementary.,"""Spark Notes A Raisin in the Sun"" is useful, but the plot does not have any hidden meanings, so assistance isn't needed very much. It does explain symbolism in things I may not have thought were symbolism. I recommend."
2,Not great,"Even for a Harlequin book, this was bad. Its way too descriptive and wordy. I couldn't care about the main characters and the only character that I really liked was Leon, the child prodigy of a absent minded dad also staying at the resort."
3,Georgia and the Tycoon by Margaret Way,"Description from the book back cover:""The last thing in the world I need is a high-powered husband,"" Georgia seemed to recall telling Link Robards on his arrival at her uncle's resort. But she knew she was fighting a losing battle. For despite her vow never to get involved with a corporate dynamo she was finding her attraction to him impossible to resist. But resist she must. At least until she discovered his true motives for being on the Great Barrier Reef island ..."
4,A Collective World Action for the 21ST Century,"The author in great ernestness has written this interesting work in 1980 entitled The Six O'Clock Bus, revised the edition with a new title Beyond Prophecies and Predictions, and then updated it with fresh insights and fufilled prophecies under Prophecies To Take You Into The 21ST Century.Essentially,the writer compiled, collated and systematically synthesized all the major world prophecies--including those of the Hopi, the Mayans, Babylonians the Bible, Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, and the Great Pyramid--into a compelling, unified theory. The crux of his message is that with all these collective wisdom and fufiled predictions from the past and the inescapable realities presently confronting us,the collective choice/actions that the human race make today will determine our fate in the future,specifically mentioned the year 2012.Positive changes in the mass consciousness and constructive actions can modify our planetary karma and avert catastrophe."
5,Perfectly wonderful desserts,"My son-in-law and I were searching through the ""library"" of cookbooks in ""Wild Oats"" a beautiful natural food store in Santa Fe, to find an elegant beautiful celebration dessert for my daughter's birthday, someone who doesn't like Birthday cakes. Had to be something that would please their 2 1/2 year old daughter too. We had some freshly frozen peaches that we hoped to use.We finally made a gorgeous Peach Melba tart lined with a chocolate glaze, which was a ""sinful"" hit with everyone, and we served it with a Baked Alaska and used the ""devils food"" cake recipe for the base, also from Angels in my Kitchen.Altogether a much appreciated gift for my daughter, who is planning many desserts to come soon from this wonderful book."
2,Drunken and out of tune.,"This is a live album recorded in NY and Dublin. Contains mostlyold Pogues songs. Shane's delivery is truly awfull - drunken,out of tune and often out of synch with the band. I have all thealbums by Pogues - I truly love the band. What Shane is doing nowis a disgrace - any Pogues fan - however musically ungifted wouldbe able to mumble those songs better after couple of pints.Sober up Shane - you start sounding like you own caricature.I gave it 2 stars mostly for the band - which, while not as greatas Pogues themselves is very comptetent."
2,"Well, at least its over.","The worst aspect of the series for fans of R.A. Salvatore and fans of the Forgotten Realms is that after this entire series is resolved, all subsequent Forgoten Realms novels will not reflect the upheaval within the Underdark portrayed ad nauseum within these pages. Will Realms now have a paralell universe? Will the utterly chaotic Drow find a common purpose to rebuild and reconcile? I'm sorry, of all the 'Realms Underdark series written to date this is by far the most commercial and dissapointing waste of recycled paper in recent memory. The several bright character persona moments through out the series are overshadowed by the rush to closure in book 6. Did every story line require a forced ending?Poor poor choices were made here, but at least its over. I am certainly waiting for reader reviews before delving into another title from this genre again. The folks here have it just about right.NP"
1,Big Let Down,"I really enjoyed, to one degree or another, the first five installments in this series and was looking forward to the release of the conclusion. Bought it the first day, read it the first day and was pretty disappointed. The wrap up to all the main characters seemed rushed and frankly, boring. I buy and read dozens of fantasy books in the course of the year, but this book has sort of turned me off to Forgotten Realms books."
2,Lacks Sympathetic Characters,"Having different authors write each book in the series is a creative approach that mostly works, technically speaking. However, by the end of the series, I was left disappointed by the fact that all the protagonists were self-centered and deceitful. Call me old-fashioned, but I still believe that at least one protagonist in the conflict needs to be sympathetic to make the story succeed."
3,Letdown,I was hoping that this book would bring a new path to the drow society or a slight divergence but it had such a weak conclusion. I found that the side plot was more entertaining. This series should have been called War of the Drow Mages. I would have been happier.
1,A terrible ending to a great series,"The beginning books showed so much promise for the drow of the Underdark. The male class was becoming stronger and bolder, the spider queen was losing her stranglehold on the race. Even the powerful cities were crubling. In the end the good characters were killed off and nothing ended up changing. I was so dissapointed"
3,All's well that ends okay....,"Well, I must say I did enjoy this series of books, but the way the whole thing ended was a bit disappointing. It seemed to offer more questions than it acutally answered. I was mad that my favorite character had to die and was even madder than another character died in a way in which he should not have been killed. He was meant to die a ""different"" way. There were a few storylines for earlier books in the series that never got resolved. I look forward to the possibility of this story continuing in another saga, but we'll have to wait and see I guess. All in all, I found the ending to a great saga to be a little thin..."
2,A big disappointment,"I really was looking forward to this book, not only because I have been a fan of the series, but because I like Paul Kemp's other ""Forgotten Realms"" novels. I thought he was a perfect guy to do a compelling story with anti-heroes, just as he has been doing in his other work. Boy was I let down.I don't know if Kemp is at fault, or if its the story arc which presumably was set up by R.A. Salvatore, but the ending is a total dud. The early books, in plot and style, suggested sweeping, vast changes to the life of the Drow were coming. When the final book ends, for the life of me I can't see any significant aspect that has changed.The most compelling characters in the books have always been Pharaun and Gromph, and the book wisely sticks to them now, but their activities feel somehow meaningless when you consider where the plot takes you. This is the most disappoined I have ever been by a FR novel."
2,Kill off the best character????,"I like Paul Kemp's writing. Its usually great - case in point the Erevis Cale trilogy. This book was a let down though. SPOILER - You killed off the best character in the entire series and basically the only reason I continued reading. 1 star for decent writing, 1 star for the klurichir...but to kill off Pharaun, HUGE disappointment. I hope Wizards brings him back for his own series..."
2,Poor finish of the series... but could have been worse!,"I felt that I needed something neutral to wash down the terrible after-taste I had after reading Annihilation - and Resurrection did just that but nothing more, unfortunately.The GOOD news is: the last book in the series does pull up from the train wreck that was Book V . It does recover just a little bit of the feeling you one may have after reading books I through IV.The BAD news is: it's definately an inferior attempt at finishing the story and it is quite unsatisfiying. It fails to close a lot of threads that were opened, it fails to deliver the tension of Book IV, mystery of Book I, and above all - fails to leave anything to readers' imagination upon reading the last page."
2,I'm amazed at how poorly this series ended.,"The first thing you need to ask yourself is, do you like the way the series has gone thus far? If you do, then by all means please completely disregard this book. It was a good read in and of itself, but if you are at all interested in the previous character development, SPOILER ALERT: They all die, or worse. Now, I'm all for a heroic death. That's wonderful. However, I can't think of a single death I would describe as heroic, fitting, or even interesting. Half the book is Gromph ""seeing the wards and the all powerful master ward"". It reminded me of the Wheel of TIme series with the ""wool-headed idiot"" comments every ten words. Just look at the reviews on this book, they speak for themselves."
1,Don't bother.,Just let it end with the fifth book. Your not missing anything at all. This was the worst ending book to a series that I have ever read. Remember what they did to Firefly....multiple by 100. What a waste. Salvatore should be ashamed. I will buy ever book written by the first five authors but I will never by one from the last.Someone should get the rights to rewrite this the way it should have been. Not to mention there was enough material and following for at least two more books.
3,The Final Chapter,"I was really torn on this one. It does a dutiful job of wrapping up the story, and has a pretty good ending, but I simply couldn't get as involved in this story as the rest. I think that by this point the author was simply railroaded into what had to take place. A fitting conclusion to the series, and if you read the other 5 are you really going to skip this one? Worth the read, just not as good."
5,"Great read, and part of history","I haven't read this book, having just ordered it, but judging by the previous work by Osa Johnson,it should be a great read. It's part of history, includes stories of Prince of Wales, George Eastman,and Henry Percival, all famous people in their own rights. Back in the 1930's when life was simpler,and the Nazi's were not creating havoc for the rest of the world."
4,Destruction of the Tea...,"Similar to Howard Zinn's ""People's History of the United States,"" Young's book views history through the eyes of a member of the ""middling"" class. The book is really two stories- the life of George Robert Twelves Hughes, a poor Boston shoemaker who was present at many famous events in Colonial Boston (as remembered by him); the second part presents the public's memory (e.g. why certain groups feel differently about certain events, how and why they came to be commemorated, etc.). Anyone intersted in American history would enjoy this thought provoking contribution. It will make you think about where we the people feel the lines are to be drawn between protesting and revolting."
3,book,good condition for being used the price was awesome and it does the job other then some writing in the book its great
3,NOT BAD,"its really huge and another thing is that the paint on it shines in the light.... so if your serious about airsofting in it, paint it with non gloss paint..."
2,Not for me,I wasn't satisfied! One size does not fit all. It keeps falling of my head unless There is something to stop it and makes me look like a bubble head doll. Fast shipping arrived on time and would deal with again. Its just not for me...
1,This is NOT a MICH Helmet... This is a PASGT helmet!,"This is a MISS-LEADING advertisement. As you can CLEARLY tell from the pictures, this is the old-style PASGT helmet, which has been largely phased out by US armed forces. The MICH helmet has 4-point suspension system, and straps, lesser ear-coverage, and no brim.Just wanted to make that clear for anyone trying to go for the ""Army"" look. Otherwise, if PASGT is what you are looking for, then you've found it! :)I can't say anything else about this helmet (since I never bought it), whether it is good or not... I don't know, and thus I can not give any stars (except for the mandatory 1st one) since I have no experience with it."
3,ok helmet,"I got this helmet and at first was impressed by the look. once i tried to fit it to my head i realized that i was not an easy task. also the plastic buckle broke the first time i wore it. i wish the strap wasn't as cheap and at least the buckle was a decent quality, could totally be one off pc, too bad i got the bad one."
4,Good helmet for the price!,"I was looking for a PASGT style helmet for scenario paintball, and this one had good reviews and a very low price so I thought I would give it a try. The helmet is quite solid, but light since it is made of plastic. It is my opinion that it could withstand a paintball hit without a problem. This helmet fits well with the Vforce Profiler paintball mask (may require forehead deflector for definite protection). Also fits very nicely with the standard Tippmann mask. Since I wanted a more realistic look I also purchased a woodland camo cover for this helmet and it fits well. The only complaint I have with this helmet is the chin strap. I have a larger head and the straps seem somewhat short and of poor construction. Specifically, the plastic buckle that secures the straps seems likely to be the first point of failure on this helmet. I may simply add my own chin strap to replace or reinforce the current strap. But overall you cannot beat it for the price., that is what sold me."
4,Not Bad at all,I got this today and the helmet came in perfect condition it is nice hard plastic the only drawback is the chin strap it is a little awkward but it is stil a great helmet
2,Not good at all.,"I ordered the OD one but to my surprise it needed up being a black one with a green strap. They also have a ""MITCH ACU Helmet cover"" which does not fit the helmet due to the brim. It says that they will fit together, which they don't. So I feel like I wasted 35 bucks on stuff that doesn't fit."
5,Just Plain Awesome,Shipping was fast. Its very sturdy and it looks awesome. Great for costume ideas. The adjustable straps make it easy for anyone to make it fit on their head. It looks and feels sturdy enough for use in paintball sessions. Ill post up an update and let you know how that works out.
5,great,Really great quality for the price asked. Everything looks brand new and realistic. Couldn't ask for a better one. Highly reccomend for airsoft or costumers like myself.
2,not the originals,"this is lacy, but not the original songs, this is all re-recorded, and not very well"
2,Remakes,I just wanted to confirm what another reviewer said about these being remakes. These aren't nearly as good as the originals.
3,Do you have kids?,"Small children often are wonderful inspiration for quilts. Sit them down, ask them to draw houses for you, then interpret their drawings into houses! All you need is tracing paper, cutting implements, and crayons, and you are ready to go. Then you can use Freddy's inspired words and concepts to create a marvelous, highly personalized, ""Freddy's House"" quilt of your own! You can also use colouring books to create patterns which, again using Freddy's inspiration, can become the quilt that you want it to be.Overall, be like Freddy, and HAVE FUN! :-)"
5,Fun to do Bright Prints Houses,Like to just have fun with those bright print scraps left over from your other quilts? This book is a must then. You will have so much fun making tons of different houses with patterns in this book.
4,Freddy's House,"A delightful explosion of colours and patterns, which demonstrates a creative approach to the basic patchwork house design, set amidst the colourful background of Freddy's own house."
3,Love the COLORS! Where's the patterns?,"I was drawn to the bold and daring use of colors that Freddy uses in all her quilts. It was fun to see how she organized and freely uses color in her home decorating. But I was disappointed when I discovered only four patterns and they weren't very user friendly. Lot's of the other interesting quilts that were featured had no patterns to go along with them. However it did inspire me to begin collecting wild, exciting prints and black and white fabric. Thanks Freddy for sharing your House!"
2,Freddys House,"The book was a disappointment. I was expecting lots of patterns and information, which was very little, 4 projects only. It really is a book about her house and reaction to it, how she has found herself etc. It is very colorful, beautiful paper and I think it was very unusual, which alot of people will love, it might make a great coffee table book, but for someone who was expecting more quilting information, for the price of a years subscribtion to the best quilting magazine, I was a little disappointed."
4,Inspiring,"The colors that Freddy's House display throughout her house and in her quilts is inspiring. I am always looking for new ideas and inspiration and her bright colors, pattern combinations and black and white accents make me want to sit down and create a new quilt and most importantly get beyond my standard palette. More patterns would be fun, but the color ideas are powerful. Thanks Freddy."
4,Wrong measurements for one of the patterns,"I borrowed this book from a friend and just loved it, so now am going to order one, to keep. I was so inspired! I could not wait to go and find just the right material to make a block. When I was cutting it today, I found that the measurements were not accurate. Being somewhat of a new quilter, I was able to sort it out, but am wondering was it me? I still recommend this book. Freddy is so creative and I loved it.The house block that I made was on page 61. Four pcs. had to be cut again, as I could not make them fit with the rest of the house."
3,myspace.com/barropanama,"this is just for coasting, and sometimes a real song comes up, usually hip hop. good, but lacks. chao, BARRO. COMBATE Fight Club. [...]"
3,FUNNY BOOK,"I really enjoyed reading this book! It's very funny, it has alot of neat facts, cool scary stories, and lots of great stuff to keep you entertained. This book is alot of fun at sleepovers. Especially when reading the scary stories. I'd reccomend this to people who are looking for a book with lots of facts, stories, and quizzes. Hope you enjoy!"
4,Must-read for Sherlockians; fun Victorian mystery for others,"Add another point if you're a Sherlockian, two if you're afan of Irene. Irene Adler, ""the woman"" to Sherlock Holmes,is the heroine of this tale, whichis written as if narrated by her friend Penelope. A fun rompthrough 19th-century Europe, involving Irene's erstwhilesuitor, the King of Bohemia, and a dastardly Russian plot.Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson have a few cameos, including onegreat one at the end that made the book for me.My maincriticism is that it's a little heavy-handed on the name-dropping side; Irene is acquainted with scads of famoushistorical personages. This actually makes it harder tosuspend disbelief and accept that both Holmes and Irene werehistorical personages, as the book attempts to convey.Well worth reading, more than once for some.Other books in the series (in order; this is the fourth):Good Night, Mr. Holmes;Good Morning, Irene;Irene At Large"
5,An excellent dance,The book arrived as advertized and in excellent condition. Have been a Holmes person for years and was glad to get one that I missed eventhough it's from Adler's view.
4,Carole Nelson Douglas' Irene Adler stories are a romp!,"Carole Nelson Douglas gives us wonderful entertainment in the latest Irene Adler romp, told by her ""Watson"", Penelope Huxleigh. The weaving of historical figures and Sherlock Holmes among several mystery plot lines makes for a delightful read. Be sure to read all four Irene stories!"
1,"I bought one , bad experience.","Weaknesses: Poor craftsman ship , no tech support or service locations in ohio area. long waits on phone for service reps lcd hdtv developed a line of dead lcds down the middle screen after 3 monthsMy akai 27 in . lcd hdtv developed a line of dead lcds down the middle of the screen after only 3 months , it went away and then came back after 9 months, I called Akai service and the said they would have a service tech call me in 48hrs to set up a repair date and time. 8 days later I still didint hear back called again and they said they couldnt find anyone to repair it in my area. its been 2weeks and no word from them."
1,AKAI Service s**ks,"AKAI 27"" Beauty. Really great display could harkly wait to get it home.Salesman promised Remote Control and manual would come later. I will never buy from that store again.The Nightmare began. It took me 3 weeks to get the customer service phone number using the Internet and phone calls to the store. I never did find an email address that worked.I finally got customer dis-service after waiting for 35 minutes on my cell phone. Customer service guy said there were no codes to use on my expensive universal remote control to work with the AKAI and that I had to buy their remote control for $65. I asked for the manual. He said he would email it to me. He sent only the pages for the remote control, nothing else. He promised the rest but I never got another response from him. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM AKAI!!!!!I rated this one star because I could not figure out how to give it a minus 10."
1,Apple Support only good in continental US,"After buyng the Apple Support Plan for Apple TV, I went to register it and apple does not offer the sevice outside of continental US. Other websites alert you before you buy it so you know before spending the money. I am trying to solve the issue with Apple, if I am not satisfied, I will request a refund."
3,Disappointed,"After the great reviews I purchased this headset only to find that apparently the mic is too short and I sound far away (I normally speak with a low voice anyway.)You can't adjust the mike so your are S.O.L. Will be returning these and searching in a store where I can ""try"" the product out before I buy (checking for fit etc...)."
2,"Bulky, Good Sound.","Are too bulky. Sound quality is good. Has inline volume and mute but never use it. RCA/analog jacks. Haven't used the microphone so can't comment on that. I would not re-purchase. I think there are better alternatives. I was happier with my previous Plantronics, which was much lighter and sounded just as good but the cheap foam covers on the ear pieces wore out and no replacements at the time."
5,Overall Best Headset,"I use this headset for Gaming.. and anything else that fits my needs, I haven't found anything better than this. If you are going to use this for something other than Gaming or for Business, I advise you to downgrade to an alternative Sennheiser PC model. This headset was designed for Gaming/Business work mostly, in my opinion. One con that some people have problems with is that the headset doesn't fully cover your ears, it just hugs the side of your ears. There are no Cons that I can think of right now. If you're wanting/needing the best, here it is. Enjoy :P. Also it has a lot of cushioning so it's like having a pillow around your head."
4,Good Product,"I got this because it was good price and its works as intended. Not much can be said, it’s a headset."
5,Pure awesome,"I loved these headphones. They were super comfortable, the sound was excellent, no problems with the mic, and an excellent price. I bought them to play Counter-Strike and Battlefield 2, and am glad I did. Music sounded good, bass wasn't ""awesome"" but rap & hip hop still sounded good.And they kept up with the near full volume explosions from Battlefield 2 nightly for nearly 3 years with out blowing a speaker. If the wires didn't get cut in multiple places (grrrr!!!) I'd still be rocking this set today ..."
5,Great headset,"I've had these for a while now and I use them for gaming and music. The sound quality is pretty good and the microphone works great, and the headset is very durable. Before deciding to get these I would go through tons of Plantronics Audio .90s and those would usually break after about one or two weeks, but I've had this headset for months now and I've never had any problems. It's also a lot more comfortable than any other headset I've used.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a durable gaming headset with good sound quality and a decent microphone at a very good price."
5,Awesome headset,"For the money, Im not sure you could purchase a better headset. Not only is the quality of the sound amazing, but the microphone is crystal clear as well. This is a great set for gaming, or if you just want to listen to music or do voice recognition. I would reccomend it to anybody."
4,"Really nice headset, but a few minor flaws","First let me just say this headset is AWESOME, the sound is rich and you can really hear the bass. The headset itself is very nicely constucted and is comfortable (mainly because of the padding.)The only two problems I found are that the cord is a bit longer than I'm used to and because of this I ocasionaly step on the cord. The other is that the two jacks are too close together, I've had to buy an extension for the microphone jack because I plug in the headphone jack into my speakers and the microphone jack into the back of my pc. (Not really a problem on my laptop hehehe.) Other than that, this has to be one of the nicest headsets I've used in a while."
2,Nice sound; poor microphone,"Amazon had a nice price on the PC150 headset. The sound quality was good, but the microphone performance was poor. The microphone's pickup and playback is too quiet. I tried troubleshooting the problem with no success. I tested the mic on two separate Dell computers (Dimension 4600 & E510) with similar results.I sent the headset into Sennheiser for repairs. They replaced it for no charge (other than shipping), but the new headset has the same microphone issues. My advice - purchase a USB headset (a separate USB adapter from Sennheiser costs more than the PC150 headset). The PC150 would be 5 stars with a better quality microphone."
4,Amazon is a little misleading,"The headphone is a fine and good quality one. However, amazon keeps calling it a noise-cancelling headphone, which it isn't. Only the microphone is noise-cancelling, not the headphone itself.Overall, I enjoyed this purchase."
4,Sennheiser headphones,For the price asked these phones are excellent. Very comfortable even for people with glasses. I wear glasses and many sets I have are uncomfortable for me.......Also incoming and outgoing audio is great.............
2,Microphone Broken.,"This is a great headset and all, good look, good feeling once you get the speakers worn in and adjusted and great sound for gaming. I haven't heard any complaints about the microphone on the internet with my friends but one day my microphone just stopped working.I am real disappointed with sennheiser, i've only had these for 3 months and now they are broken...and i've seen other cases of people owning this headset and having the same problem. After about 2-3 months the microphone blew out. NOT the best choice."
2,NOT noise canceling,"This are NOT active noise cancelling headphones. Yes, they do have a microphone but that's it. They are not portable so don't even think about using them to take along with a laptop. They do have a nice sound and are good for internet/gaming, but I bought them as noise canceling. I have appealed to the manufacturer who have not return my emails."
5,Just got these and...,"...OH MY GOD....and OH MY GODThese are easily the best headphones I have used in my life. Incredibly confortable, and excellent audio. I havent tried the mic yet, but Im gonna do that soon. This is easily worth the $46 I paid for them at Amazon (if not more). Very modern packaging too.Summary: BUY THESE NOW"
2,hmmmm,"At first when i got these headphones, they were great. But now, 2 weeks later they dont work. i plugged in another pair of headphones in my computer and they worked fine, but i just had these 2 weeks and they died out on me.......im wondering if there is a replacement warranty?"
4,Solid performance,"This headset is pretty good in my opinion and worth the money. The sound is good, excluding the bass. I wouldn't say these are a bad performer in the bass area, but not great. But, i think that all headsets lack in the bass department, so i would rate them 3.5 for bass. If you have a big head, be warned that these will start to hurt your ears after a few hours. So far i have purchased two of these headsets, and am satisfied. Also, the mic is great, just have to be sure to position it close to your mouth or adjust settings to pick up quieter sounds. The cord is thin, so be careful not to run it over with your chair. Overall, they get the job done, and probably better than the majority of their competition in the same price range.Pros - Good sound and bass for a headset, awesome micCons - Thin cord, squeezes larger heads, hurts after a few hours"
2,"Okay for music, not the best for voice. Mic broke after a year, tight headband.","The mic seems to work pretty well, although it doesn't seem to cancel out background noise as well as it's supposed to.The headphones are a bit bass-heavy, which makes them okay for certain types of music but a little less desirable for voice chat. The headband is also very uncomfortable--I don't have a very large head, but the headband is way too tight when adjusted to the correct length. When I adjust it to be as wide open as possible, it's almost acceptable, but then it doesn't fit very well.Update: The mic broke after about a year of gentle use. I would have hoped a premium product would have lasted longer, but now I've gone back to a $12 Logitech Extreme Gaming headset."
3,Fantastic microphone but headphones leave much to be desired.,"You would think the cans would be better than ear-buds even at $40. The bass is very harsh and does not leave a whole lot of room for treble to shine; it is definitely not balance.It does truly shine with its microphone. It's very clear and audible even when shouting (it's actually harder to understand people when they yell).If you want to buy this as to be a jack-of-all trades headphones, don't expect it to be good with music."
1,Way overpriced,"This is my fifth PC headset. I bought it based on Sennheiser's rep and reviews. All of my other 4 ranging from cheapie $9.99 Radio Shack to $25 Labtec 302s sounded better than these. The high range is pathetic, the mid range very distorted and the over pumped bass is distorted too, and doesn't go low at all. These are way overrated and overpriced."
3,Sennheiser PC150 Noise Cancelling PC Headset,The head set worked like a dream for a few days before the microphone cut out on me permanently. Wasnt too satisfied with it but worked well for the short time it did work.
4,Great Headset,The PC150 NCPC Headset is working great. I had to play with it to get things going. Now I know how to operate and it's working great.
2,MIC IS WEAK,"The headphones work well and the sound quality is good for the price. I do have an issue with the noise canceling microphone. It sounds muffled and the volume level is very low, regardless of how the software is configured on the PC. I am ordering another headset because this microphone just isn't going to cut it for using with Skype."
3,Good for VOIP,I originally ordered this headset for primarily listening to music with and to occasionally be able to use with skype. Music sounded mediocre although compared to most headsets the sound is better than average. Its comfortable but could use a bit more padding. The mic's sound quality is great when I used it with skype and the people that I call can't tell the difference from a regular phone.Good for VOIP not so good for Music.
5,comfortable with good sound,"This headset is very comfortable and has pretty good sound, bass isn't the best, but overall it is good and I've had compliments on how clear my mic sounds. I can wear it for 10 hours straight completely forget that I'm wearing it. Only problem I've had is when I bump the mic switch on cord it makes it crackle."
4,Nice headset - but some issues,"True to the Sennheiser brand name, these are very good headsets. It is very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Highly adjustable to any head size. But there are some inherant issues that I came across... here are some -1. The bass is not as much as I had expected.2. volume control wheel moves too easily... and the fact that the wheel protrudes out, makes it easily move when it brushes against anything.But overall, this is a very good headset, nice sound quality."
2,"Headphones, Great Sound and Scratchy Microphone","The sound from these headphones can't be beat, but even though the attached mike boom functions well-it's sound is scatchy on both ends. You really need the USB connector type headset, not the 3.5 mm connectors on this unit. I have tried USB headset and they are clear as a bell."
3,Not good for PowerBook G4,"The headsets sound is very good and I am pleased with it. However I am not pleased at all with the fact that I had to do quite some digging before finding out that the microphone of this headset cannot be used with the line-in input of my PowerBook G4, because the line-in is NOT ok for microphones which need additional power.Ok, my fault for not checking in advance, but for sure it would help to have Mac compatibility sign on the products.So, if you need a good headset and microphone for Mac DON'T buy this product, but go for an USB based set (Logitech models as an example, if you don't want to spend a lot of money). If you have a PC and/or you just want a good sound, Sennheiser is really ok and a good price quality ratio."
2,Let Down,"I thought the Senn's would be a good product.Pro's:1) Sound Quality is great2) Adjustable Volume inline3) ComfortableCons:1) Cheaply made2) Falling apart! The Cusion on the top of the headset is already falling off - (only had for 3 weeks with light careful use)3) Returned one and getting ready to return the second.4) The Mike Boom will not stay in any position, it always falls to the bottom - thought maybe it was a bad pair, so returned them and this pair has the exact same problem."
3,skip the first 12,"skip the first twelve cuts, they are a work in progress, the rest really rock with that retro fifties/eighties punk attitude, well written songs....and guitar energy..."
5,"If you don't like this, you're dead!!!","I just received this CD today and I am almost through the second disk. I had all of the Blasters output on vinyl from the first go round and I think I forgot how great these guys were. The hair is standing up on the back of my neck as I type these words. I remember seeing the original line-up somewhere in Columbus, OH in '83 or '84. At the time, I was sure that nothing could be any hotter or true to real, scorching from the heart music. I am glad that the complete and underated ""Over There"" EP is included in it's entirety plus. If you ever saw these guys tear the roof off or have any interest in balls out true rocking music, I would definitely recommend this truly complete collection of The Blasters output. Besides the great music, the liner notes and packaging from Rhino are first class."
2,Beware which version,"Make sure the version you purchase is not the German one, which cannot be downloaded onto your PC. I made that mistake and now have to buy it again."
5,ALL IN ONE,"IF YOU LIKE THE ROCKABILLY SOUND THIS IS FOR YOU. GREAT SONGS FROM ONE OF THE GREATEST BANDS FROM U.S.A., THIS COLLECTION HAVE ALL THE SONGS YOU SHOULD NEED TO HAVE FROM THE BLASTERS, A CLASICC RECORD!!!"
4,"Great value, good quality","This rack has worked perfectly through two winter seasons carrying multiple skiis and snowboards. The rack is very light and doesn't feel extremely sturdy, but it's been flawless so far. As someone else noted, I've gone well over the 55mph recommended limit without problems. It's a little challenging to install, but not too bad. I put it on a 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan with the factory crossbars. The locks work fine. I would highly recommend this rack over higher-priced ones from Thule and Yakima."
5,YES!!!,"For those reviewers concerned about this CD ""dumbing down"" classical music by the addition of clever lyrics, I say ""LIGHTEN UP, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"" I am a professional musician whose children love this catchy, fun, educational CD which, by the way, stays true to the original (acoustic) orchestration without adding synthesizers or electronics. My 9 year old had memorized the entire CD in a very few days, and will no doubt remember the themes (and their composers) forever. His 7 year old brother is not far behind. I highly recommend this CD to anyone with children."
5,Great Idea,This is such a creative way to introduce children to the symphonies. Even our 5 yr old loves it.
1,Ahhhhhhhhggggggggggggg!!! (By Beethoven Lover),What a dumb album! I like Beethoven's music= this is a complete outrage! I think its made by Beethoven Haters!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Excellent for parents & kids,"We received this as a 1yr b-day present for our son. When we opened it to listen, both my husband & I laughed everytime one of the songs played. They are very very witty and enjoyable to listen to. Sometimes children's music can wear on you, but this one is my favorite hands down. We in fact give it to all of our friends whose babies turn 1 now."
1,Irritating,"Humor is subjective. I liked the idea of this cd but when I bought it, I found the lyrics annoying and not really funny. Obviously a lot of other people like but I found it frustrating to have wasted the money. My kids prefer it when I put on regular classical music. They (3 and 4) like listening for all the different instruments. The lyrics seemed more distracting than funny (older kids probably ""get"" the lyrics in a way preschoolers don't)."
3,Factual errors?,"Caveat: I've not read this book. I'm adding this review because my glimpse at it via Amazon's ""Look Inside"" feature revealed a basic error of fact on p. 2, which makes me wonder about the level of scholarship involved.To wit: Thompson cites 1979's _Just A Gigolo_ as Bowie's ""big-screen debut"", overlooking his performance in the leading role of Thomas Newton in 1976's _The Man Who Fell To Earth_.I'd expect someone writing about Bowie to get this sort of detail right: it's not exactly an obscure fact. Can't comment on the book as a whole, but this isn't leaving me with much desire to read the rest."
5,"Fascinating woman, good BBall","Weatherspoon is one of the most admirable players to come down the pike since the days of Bill Bradley. The book -- with lots of illustrative pictures -- is aimed at teaching younger players, but has good fundamental advice for players of any age (or gender, for that matter). What makes it fascinating are the set-off pieces by Weatherspoon that give an insight into her character. If you like her now, you'll come away liking her even more."
3,Devo Part 2,"Mix Primus, Devo and Reel Big Fish in a big blender and you've got the new Aquabats Cd. This Cd is nothing like what the Aquabats have originally put out, but it is still equally good....if you like Devo that is. There is barely any ska in this disc, so if you're a ska fan, then you'll probably be dissapointed. To me, the Aquabats tried a bit too hard to be like Devo..it would have been great if they used their own sound...but still a decent disc anyway."
4,"Not too bad, just not what I was expecting","Well, after much listening and reviewing of this CD, I came to the conclusion that it's pretty alright. Yeah granted, it's not nearly as good as ""the Fury"" (I don't have the third), but it's still one that I enjoy. Sure I was expecting the horns like in the Fury, but they just weren't there. The whacked-out lyrics are still there, and it's still a fun CD, just like traditional Aquabats. The loss of the Baron Von Tito, the drummer, who happened to go with BOTH Blink 182 and Joy Electric (who both happen to be HORRIBLE bands) perturbs me just a tad, and maybe his absense caused the change of the music. Anyway, it's a good CD if your a die-hard fan of the Aquabats. I don't recommend buying it if your just getting into the ska/punk scene."
1,AQUABATS FALL DOWN GO BOOM!,"HA! Aquabats are big stinky heads! The Lincolns in their bank account must be stored in the John Wilkes Boothe Home Savings & Loans! HA HA! Hey didn't DEVO originally release this album as ""Oh No Its Devo,Shout,Smooth Noodle Maps""? HA HA HA! And didja notice...there was no story or updates from The Professor? Its because we kidnapped him! (He's wearing tiny pants as we speak....ON HIS HEAD!).HA HA HA HA! Songs about DOGS? Okay. But Mr.Bonkers the Scorpion? No thank you Aquatwits! And I don't think thats Glue on those Glooey hands! You are hereby taunted to put out another CD sooner! (Or we'll marry off another Aquabat!) You big buncha kooties!"
2,What is this crud?,"Man I loved the Aquabat's first two compact discs, and I was sure I'd love this one, boy was I wrong. The worst thing about this album is that they have gotten rid of their awesome ska sound. While the band is still zany, the music isn't the same without the ska. Instead of the usual ska, they replaced their sound with more of a zany space rock sound. Unless you've heard and like this album I'd recommend to pass it by."
3,ooooo.. ouch,"My poor, poor Aquabats, what happened? These guy's were quite possibly one of the bets Ska bands i have ever heard (and believe me, i know my stuff). This dramatic change was a shock. Yes, i will agree there are some mighty fine tracks, however, with the loss of the sax and the new drummer, they are not the same. The lyrics are still the best yet, however i wish it were more like their other albums. The Fury of the Aquabats and The Return of the Aquabats are excellent albums. i love them to death. so, if you don't have those, i suggest buying those first before purchasing this one. In fact, just pass this one up if you want. Sorry Aquabats but you let me down. (None the less, i'm gonna go see them Noverber 17)."
2,A departure,"In their classic ""Playdough,"" The Aquabats pay tribute to Devo. The Devo influence becomes very obvious on their 3rd CD, which is also their weakest effort. Most of their trademark ska is missing from this album, replaced by a very Devo-esque new wave pop feel. It can be fun, but it just doesn't compare to the early stuff. In fact, some of the songs will have you reaching for the ""skip"" button, a first for an Aquabats CD. The songs are still wacky and have that Aquabats humor to them, but they're also slower and less melodic and fun. Luckily, for every weak song on the album, there's a good one to balance it out. Some of the best include the irresistibly fun ""Man With Glooey Hands"" and ""Lovers Of Loving Love,"" which might just be the greatest love song ever written. Unfortunately, those songs will be among the only ones played on this album. The rest may simply be skipped and forgotten. Still a great band though."
4,Legit!,"The cover describes exactly what this album sounds like. A really cool actiony sound with some goofy villains and songs.My only complaint is that ""Giant Robot-Birdhead"" says ""cholo"" in it and that's not cool.So I give the album 4/5."
2,What did they DO?,"Although I hold these guys dear to my heart, the Aquabats on this CD are not the Aquabats I know and love. On their previous CD's, I liked the Aquabats for their excellent ska musicianship and uplifting, witty lyrics. This CD however is missing both of those. I tried to like it, I truly did, but I couldn't. The music is loud and obnoxious, and the lyrics are pointless. A few songs are bearable, especially ""Anti-Matter"", which I like, but if I hear my little brother play ""Canis Lupis"" or ""Radiation Song"" one more time, vinyl is going to fly. That's what kind of music we're talking about. Here's a tip- If you liked the Aquabats before because of their ska skills, pass this one up. If you liked them for their wackiness, you will probably dig ""Floating Eye""."
1,Why The Change!!!!,"What happened!?!?! I bought the last 2 cd's that the Aquabats made, great stuff. Now, what the? The funny lyrics, tunes with lots of horn, laugh out loud songs....ALL GONE!!! If you need to buy this CD, go ahead, don't say I didn't warn you. I suggest The Fury Of the Aquabats! Don't waste money on their worst CD to date!!"
2,The bats sold out,"Hey, look at the cd! They sold out, look at their single Anti-Matter, they made it to appeal to what is trendy now! This cd stinks, wheres the ska feeling? Damn!"
1,What happened.....,"I ran out today, the first day it was on sale, and bought this CD like any loyal Cadet would do. Little did I know the horror that was in store for me when I got home and tore the CD from its case. I placed it in my CD player, and....nothing. I was awaiting a trumpet, or a saxophone. Instead, I got a punk guitar and a voice that didn't even sound like the beloved Bat Commander. This CD isn't even Ska. Its bad punk with a trumpet and funny lyrics. And even the lyrics aren't that good. I don't know what happened to them. Its probably the biggest let down,music wise,I've ever had. I can't possibly give it a good score.If you want to do yourself a favor, buy their two older CDs. They're the best CDs I own, and until now, these guys were my favorite band...I'm just going to forget that this poor, poor album was ever published, and continue on with life.."
3,Not Good,This is the Aquabats worst outing and its pretty bad. Fury and myths are much better. But there new alblum Charge! is my favorite Fashion Zombies is the best song they have made. But if you liked them for being ska then you wont like Charge they almost have no ska on it and the horns are completely gone.
1,I was severely dissapointed,"I have the first two and thought, hey, the first cd's were awsome so this must be. WRONG! It is just about the dumbest ska cd i've heard. they got way to slow, and a lot of it is garbage."
5,kinda sad how....,.....people always overlook this album alot its really greatt and deserves notice it was the first aquabats album i ever listened to and it's AWESOME!!!
3,A bit dissapointed,ok. first off this is my least favorite cd of the aquabats [the other two rule]. I believe that this could have been much better. Actually i take that back...if they got rid of tiny pants..it would probably have gotten 5 stars by me. I cannot stand that annoying song. It sounds like a kid song you would hear on like telletubbies or blues clues or something. Im sorry aquabats..that song is horrible. other that that..i think u havent changed much. your lyrics are wacky..yet at times serious [chemical bomb]. the first 3 songs are a great opening and then u got songs like canus lupis and some of those others towards the end..with the excception of tiny pants[agghh] all in all pretty good..o ya the new synthesizer sound is pretty cool too.
5,A wealth of information.,"I grew up on the Texas Gulf coast and spent a lot of time beachcombing. This book pulls together fascinating ""lifestyle"" information about dozens of creatures I've always wondered about. Very readable Q and A format."
3,Good Quote Book,"This book is pretty good. It has a lot of powerful quotes that really help you if you have a trying week/life. Helen Keller was an astounding woman, and reading her words will definitely change your perceptions of her, as well as others society perceived as ""different"" or ""disabled.""If you like this book, I recommendTo Live, To Think, To Hope - Inspirational Quotes by Helen Keller- it's a little cheaper, and has more information on Helen's actual life aside from her quotes, but they are both great."
3,No Door,This is a very cute garden stake. The only problem is that the lantern does not have a door that opens so a candle can be placed inside. You have to take the whole lantern apart. Kind of hard to light a candle when you have to disassemble and then reassemble the lantern. Needs a door.
4,Awesome book!,"The Cipher is the first book I've read by Kathe Koja. I have to say, I am ready to try some more of her books! The Cipher was wickedly eery and I really got into the characters. I hated Nakota, felt angry pity for the lead character's way of not standing up for himself. But it was a very good book and worth my time."
5,Strange and intense,"A young man is a poet living in squalor. He's in love with a woman who doesn't love him, or anything. They discover a hole in the floor which can do horrible things. The prose style is remarkable. The story is strong from start to finish. It never falls apart or lets you down. You have to think about it to understand what happens, but the author gives you enough information. Recommended."
3,Not completely disappointed,"For a book that made several top twenty lists of the scariest book ever it fell a bit short. Still, it presented an interesting scenario and overall idea. I would not hesitate to recommend the book."
2,Uninviting,"After struggling with the book for weeks, this reviewer can happily say: all bad things do come to an end--finally. Yes, the award winning THE CIPHER is far from being what it's cracked up to be. Sure, the theme is original enough with its dark view of society throughout a twentysomething artist relationship with a hole in a room; and sure, the narration is up a notch with its poetic hold of things; but as a whole the novel just reeks un-involvement, mostly due to the overabundance of marginality in the piece. The unsympathetic characters treat just doesn't cut it; as of the dog chasing its tale story line (really, how many times can the reader endure this whole hole obsession repetitiveness without thinking of giving up). In the end, what appears to be horror literature, comes off being nothing more than a test of endurance where immersion and written chains of events could have been so much more.-----Martin Boucher"
1,I loathed this book.,"This book sucked. 356 pages about a hole in the floor. I was so disgusted that I had wasted my time reading this book. And I didn't like any of the characters of the book. I thought they were hole-worshipping morons and sincerely wished that they had all jumped into the hole by the end of the book. I was also severely dissapointed in that wishy-washy ending; ""Maybe I will jump in the hole now."". What a waste of paper. I shudder to think of all the trees that sacrificed their lives to have this crap printed on them."
1,Cipher,"Took me 2 weeks to finish the book.(Didnt want to waste my money NOT reading it..LOL) Had to be the worst book I ever read. It was confusing at best. I was amused the praise for the book said 'unforgettable'..as they are surely right. I wont forget how badly written it was. There is no real horror at all..unless you find a hole in the floor horrifying. I still wonder what the plot was?..There is usally a plot to a book, right? Certaintly not a thought provoking read..nor a psychological thriller. By time I was done with the book I had wished everybody had just jumped in the damn hole so the book would have ended chapters before it did."
1,"Simply poor writing, undeveloped story, unfinished concept","The best thing I can say about this book is that I finished it, because I paid for it.It's not even competent writing. The plot was undeveloped (what makes a black hole a ""process""? And what does that mean? That's about all you ever get for an explanation of this ""Funhole"", and nothing more is offered.) Worst of all, nothing dramatic even occurs. Where's the flipping story?The main character -- can't even remember his name -- was one part of this book that did not suck... he was a likable fellow, despite the asinine hole growing in his hand and leaking ectoplasm all over the place, making people flock to him like a Messiah for no real reason. Overall, unredeeming. No fear, even. A simple book like its own black hole -- an inexplicable and contrived miss.I find it most interesting that this book was even published."
2,The Cypher,I think this book had potential to be scary..but?Like other readers I wished everyone had gone down the FunHole (except Vanese -she was the only posititve character in this book).The book kept you interested until you became sick of the players and their obsession and of Nicholas putting up with it all.Weird...sums it up.
4,GREAT sticky and durable tape,"The material is almost fabric like. Very sticky, will adhere to almost any surface. I have tried it on glossy oak, plastic, and drywall (with and without paint) works great, very heavy duty.My only con is that there isn't very much tape, only 15 yards, a little pricey but the quality is fantastic."
4,Nice..,"Duck tape was darker in color than I imagined, but I was pleased nonetheless. I used this tape to make duck tape roses for my fiance"
2,Large label...not much tape,"If you were hoping there was alot more tape under that label, you'll probably be disappointed. Tape itself is just fine."
5,What's not to love about duck tape.,Duck tape is expensive anywhere you look but when you find it for a good deal it is worth it!
5,Duck Tape and Lightening Bolts,The Duck tape was everything you would want Duck tape to be. We were using this to cover the edges of lightening bolts in a play and the shiny gold tape worked perfect. My prop kit is filled with all colors of Duck tape. It solves a number of problems.
4,Bought for ballet pointe shoes,I bought this tape for my daughter who dances. She says it matches the color of her pointe shoes pretty well. She uses the tape to hold the shank of her shoe in place.
4,Costly,I use this for my roller derby gear and my daughter uses it for crafts. I have no complaints about the product itself only the price. You can purchase this for almost half of the Amazon price at craft stores or Walmart. If you notice the fancier colors/designs are often the same price as a roll of plain color but a much smaller roll.
5,Great product as stated,"Matched what I was looking for within a shade or two. Great product. Great brand, fast shipping. Highly Recommend! Would buy again."
4,The Sun Never Rises: A Rainthology,"This book has potential, but some of the stories weren't quite as good as some of the others. Some were very outstanding and the illustrations were extremely well done! I'll be interested to see other works by this group."
1,this is a Grim reality,"I found this book to be highly disturbing in it's appearent repression of homosexual undertones. It was like trying to read between the lines and find the author's deep, dark (not well hidden) secrets.The illustrations were finely penned however. They just deserved a better text to highlight them."
2,HP23 C1823A,I haven't been happy with it as the color is faded and seems to run out of ink too fast.
2,No Yellow Ink,"The price was great and it works in my HP Deskjet 812c printer, but the yellow ink doesn't print. I've tried cleaning and priming the print heads, but the yellow still doesn't print. The price is low enough that it's not worth returning, I can still use it for drafts and documents where color accuracy doesn't matter, but I'll try a different vendor when this one runs dry."
1,No blue. Not worth the savings.,"I could not remember the brand that I had bought previously so I went by some of the reviews and picked the HP23 from Speedy Inks. The blue ink (of the three color cartridge) is either empty on arrival, hardened up, or plugged. I don't know which. It has never printed blue. Thus, you cannot print yellow or green. Everything comes out pinkish. I will call Amazon to see about a return. If I have to pay shipping then it won't be worth it. Skip this brand."
1,piece of garbage,"I bought this cartridge hoping that the professional can refill the cartridge better than I can. Was I wrong. I refilled my previous cartridge myself. It was a mediocre job. It did print out for a few months with mediocre quality. When I bought this cartridge, I did ONE test page print, it was fine.About a month later, I need to print out some stuff. Nothing came out. I just bought a $7 piece of garbage."
2,Very short life,"The first few pages I printed with this cartridge came out just fine. The next time I used it (about a month later), it was only printing a light shade of red. I tried using the printer's self-cleaning function, no dice. I tried physically wiping the surface of the print head with some rubbing alcohol; it didn't help. Not really sure how it went bad so quickly, but it did. I've never had a problem like this with original HP cartridges, but I'd be open to trying a similar recycled cartridge again from a different supplier."
5,Hp 23 ink,Like everyone I am trying to save whenever I can. Ordering from Eforcity allows me to do just this.
5,Learn about the history of several Cleveland Women.,"Received the book in fine condition and timely. Have read the book cover to cover and found it beneficial for my research on the history of the women who helped to build the history of the Cleveland area. Women in their era only had their name printed in the newspapers three times in their lives - when they were born, married and finally at their death. Read here to fill in the blank spaces and see what they did for us."
5,"Finally, its about time!","With all the books on the Music Industry out there written by so called experts, its quite a shock to purchase one that actually tells us would be Indie CEO's, label owners, Artists, Managers and marketers the real deal.I found this book to be overwhelmingly informative. ANYTHING you need to know about releasing, distributing and promoting your titles - its in this book! The book is my new Indie Bible, the exact manual for understanding how things get done, and most importantly - HOW TO ACTUALLY DO THEM!! You gotta have it.Kudos to the Authors, this book is worth PLATINUM!S. MontanoVertigo Records, LLC"
4,Good book,"You're an up and coming artist with great music, a great producers to back it up , lots of people are talking about you, but you can't get your music to sell? If this situation is troubling you right now you might want to seek some help , help that is available between the covers of this book by C. Michael Brae, an extensive guide into the difficult business of promoting one's music. As most people know, the hard part is not producing the music, but getting it out into the public, promoting it , getting it known and eventually selling it. A good complete guide with great structure and easy to understand."
5,Down to Earth - the Best I've Read.,"Outstanding perspectives, easy read, full of useful, applicable info. Truly the 1st of its kind, well worth it. If you're serious about the game, START HERE."
3,Good for beginners,I read this book in one day. I must admit that I expected more from this one. I expected more informations about distribution and not some resource sections. I think this book is good and covers some basics but sure it's not for experienced players. Maybe it's becouse I already read many music biz books.
2,Why wasn't this on the fist album?,"It is curious that the Halo 2 soundtrack was broken into two separate CD's in the first place, instead of just the 4 songs from the major bands that weren't part of the game. If you are true fan and just have to have all the music, drop the 10-12 bucks (new). Otherwise, I much prefer the music from Halo I."
5,Vol 2 the Best yet!,"I now own all three Halo albums, and I have to say that this is the best yet. I found it to be more true to the game than the previous volume. I found the score to be fantasic and brilliant. Marty O'Donnell is a amazing composer who has brought a life and emotion to the games threw his music. I am proud to own all of his work, but this album is by far his greatest work. I loved every minute and second of this album. I reccomend this album to the Halo fans and to anyone who hasn't played the games. Favorite tracks: 6 Unforgotten and 12 Epilogue. To all those who read this review God bless and check out the games if you haven't already."
4,Yet another CD that demonstrates talent outside of movie-music,"This CD was awesome, even compared to the Halo: Combat Evolved CD and the Halo 2 vol. 1 CD. It proves yet again that there is musical talent (or should I say SUPERB musical talent) in the gaming industry. There is even a song (possibly the best on the CD) featuring Steve Vai on guitar. The only problem with this CD is that it is comprised of suites, which are each made of different smaller ""songs"", and you can't skip to an individual movement in the suites. Overall, this CD shows that a great videogame deserves some great music to go along with it."
4,Inspiring and Fun!,"Salvatori and O'Donnell have created a memorable and inspiring collection of instrumental melodies in this second compilation of tracks from the Halo 2 video game. Its melodies rival that of its predecessors (Halo and Halo 2, volume 1). Salvatori and O'Donnell capture the emotion and environment of a video game, yet offer a taste of the finely mastered quality you would expect from great composers of memorable movie soundtracks. I only gave this soundtrack 4 stars because I wish some of the movements were longer, as the melodies are so inspiring, yet leave you craving for more. No connoisseur of video games, instrumental music, or movie soundtracks should go without Halo 2, volume 2."
5,Wonderful Resource for Parents and Teachers!,This book will tell you where a child should go next in all developmental domains. It's full of examples of appropriate practices for curriculum planning. It covers infants through 8-year-olds. It's a life-saving assessment tool. I would recommend it to any parent or teacher.
3,Satisfying,"The materials within the book are alright. Even though some of the text may need to be updated (mainly due to the published date), it is still proven useful as a frequent resource. Looking at the book's condition, I still think it is considered good as new. It only has a few creases here and there in small areas. None of the pages inside are actually affected by the creases. Looking forward to a good use of this book."
1,Check the publishing date!,I ordered this book for a class I am taking only to discover there is a more recently published edition (January 2009) with the same ISBN that has over 100 more pages and a CD. I should have known that $3.99 was too good to be true!
1,never recieved it,I am not sure who will receive this but I am very upset and I would like a refund or the book I ordered. I never received this book and it has been over a week past the latest day I would receive it. Please will someone get back to me about my missing book.
3,Changes aren't always for the better.,"Went looking for a cd version of Tim Hardin's last song, ""Unforgiven"", so far available only on vinyl. Found it on this compilation.....or so I thought. To my dismay, someone had thought they would do Tim one better, and so padded this song with a Vegas chorus and a lot of hoo-ha added to the mix. The fundamentals are still there, but its mutton dressed as lamb. Some of the other songs are untouched, so it wasn't a total wash."
3,"Great singing, but very dated production","Tebaldi and London clearly have this opera down pat--they can emerge after grueling singing and still smile sweetly like movie stars at the audience. The sets are primitive by today's standards, the staging/lighting is also very elementary although London manages somes effective serpentine movements. It is fantastic to see Tebaldi and London perform but the picture quality is only fair and the sound not nearly as good as the contemporary (1960) London/Decca CD set with T, L, and Del Monaco."
5,DON'T MISS IT !,"With a plethora of Tosca DVD's, there would seem to be little reason to add a black and white version with simple sets and traditional production. My reason for recommending that you do so lies in the fact that it is as good as any you will find and of historical value as well. Why? Renata Tibaldi and George London! Each is at the top of his form. Each produces memorable moments. We also get a chance to see and hear the American tenor, Eugene Tobin, who never scaled the heights of the operatic world, but shows himself to be capable of sharing the stage with two of the Masters.I should note that this brief review was originally attached to another of Tebaldi's performances of Tosca. My thanks go to Corliss Phillabaum, whose comment set me on the right track."
2,Frustrating!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book because Michelle Reid is one of my favourite romance writers, but I was really disappointed. Basically the heroine in this was so soppy it was untrue. She thinks about leaving her lover because the relationship isn't going anywhere and there is no prospect of a marriage proposal in sight, but lo and behold when he touches her she no longer sticks to her convictions about leaving. Basically she is a doormat and the hero seems to get his own way all the time. I waited all the way through this book for the heroine to stand up for herself, but she just let herself be used all the way. All in all there was no real action in this book, no volatile emotions or suspense, not even a jealousy tantrum in sight. I just hope that Michelle Reid's next book returns to her usual standards."
2,Mistress-y books are so not for me!,"Granted, they loved each other from the very beginning- at least I could grasp that much each time Raschid said 'gruffly' that he cared about Evie. I have come to the conclusion that I don't like 'mistress books' or 'mistress-themed books' on harlequin. It takes away the fun of experiencing the chase and romance along with the characters. I have found out that usually the mistresses get pregnant, and pine so much for the hero and are almost always uncertain about the hero's feelings for them. The pregnancies in most cases always make them act like doormats, while the hero decides to do the 'honorable' thing by marrying them because of the pregnancy and stuff like that....that is just getting too old for me. I wonder why it took me this long to realize that I do not enjoy all these 'mistress-y books', I'm sorry!!"
4,loved it!!,i really enjoyed reading this book...i became a michelle reid fan after reading this....not your usual mistress story since h was independently wealthy and she also came from a rich family...
3,Didnt hold up,My son's vehicle is a rolling sound machine like many youngpeople have now. BOSS AUDIO is usually a very good choice.This one did not hold up to the Boss reputation.
3,A little disappointing,"I always have confidence that a Que Publication will be just about the best available on a subject. However, I was disappointed that this new Special Edition Using WordPerfect 12 was printed in one color. In a book this large, using blue ink was visually very helpful in spotting main headings and sections. I actually received a response from a Que spokesperson when I emailed my comments to them, who said the cost of two-color printing was much greater than the benefit it actually provided the consumer (they did contact some consumers and WordPerfect experts for their opinions before making their decision).A picayunish point, I readily concede."
4,Cajun Seasoning,"This is a good cajun seasoning, but it was not hot at all.Not like most Cajun food.I added some cayene pepper to mine and that made it great."
3,"Worth the price, but no more.","Very smooth panning, feels like a true fluid head. Up-Down okay with up to 3 to 4 lb load. Two bubble levels for both H and V leveling, but are not crowned, so they are less than friendly. Quick connect camera mount is good and very secure. Leg adjustments are good, screw jack is effective and can be pushed down or screwed down. The carry-handel is useful. Very light and easy to carry and put into use. Very good packaging in carton that can be kept for storage. I would recommend the IY-332 for light use, once or twice a month; or for vacation/travel."
2,Slow shipping and incomplete order,I ordered several items from Barry Farms to make a holiday dish and my order not only arrived too late but was incomplete. I got a note inside the box saying my ingredient was not available but I would have appreciated knowing that prior to getting my order so I could have placed an order elsewhere. I live in a remote area and have to order a lot of ingredients online so I was just out of luck. A simple email would have sufficed.
3,Yet another re-release . . . but a good one,"The material on this album has been around the block several times; it's a re-release of the 1956 Scepter album Bechet and Blues. Bechet recorded it in Paris, playing with the Claude Luter Orchestra, his backing band at the time. At the beginning of ""Blues from the Cave,"" he calls out trumpeters Pierre Merlin and Claude Rabanit, trombonist Guy Longnon, bassist Roland Bianchini, pianist Christian Azzi, and drummer ""Mustache"" Galepides, all members of the Luter band in the mid-1950s.As was so often the case in his Paris years, Bechet's playing dominates every track, far outshining the other band members. Particular standout tracks, to my ear, are ""I Had it But It's All Gone Now,"" ""Soprano Blues,"" and ""Blues in the Cave."" After hearing this, a next good purchase would be some of Bechet's incandescent work with Louis Armstrong."
4,don,very convenient. The person who sets it up needs to take it down. If you try to put it away and are not careful you may (at at least my wife) be prone to force it and bend the cross bars.
1,Rio Adventure Aluminum Roll-Up Table,"The Rio Adventure Aluminum Roll-Up Table is a cheap, flimsy knockoff of the Canyon Table and is no substitute for the real thing. I gave away my Canyon table that I had used for several seasons and wanted to get one to replace it. Looking at the picture of the Rio Adventure table I thought that it was the same as the Canyon and that I could save some money by purchasing the Rio. Huge mistake! The table top of the Rio is made up of thin, unreinforced aluminum that will bend under a very minimal load, and the bungee cord that is supposed to hold the slats together is far too weak to do its job. If you are looking for a lightweight roll-up table, don't even think about buying the Rio Adventure unit. Pay the extra money and get a Canyon table."
3,Clever but shaky.,"This clever little roll-up table comes in a compact duffel type little bag. It takes a bit of manipulation to get the legs in position,and once assembled, the table is quite shaky. In addition, the slats have plastic end pieces that fall out. I had to glue mine in to avoid that annoying little problem. That said, the price is right for a good solution, should you need a little table that collapses into a small, handy carry bag."
4,Great Table for the outdoors,This table was so easy to set up and very lightweight. I took it to a concert in the park and it was more sturdy than I expected. I love this table!!!
4,Nice table for price,Just received this table and used it for a 6-day camping trip. It worked well for us - used it every day for each meal.
2,Not worth the price. Not sturdy.,This table is definitely not sturdy. It's legs and supports are too thin. I wouldn't put anything heavier than a jigsaw puzzle on it. The slats are joined together with elastic cord that I expect will give out sooner than later. The thing wobbles after assembling and it is tricky to get it all together and comes with no instructions. This is not something you should spend [...] on. The carrying case was nice.
4,An utter delight,"Meg Allison deserves far more recognition that what she has received. The songs are incredible, and Allison's delivery and expression are terrific.Take a chance...spend the few dollars and get a copy of this pearl while you can.Highly-recommended, without reservation."
3,Moderately Enjoyable,"This book started out with a funny and promising plotline, but petered out rather soon. By the middle of the book I had given up on all of the characters and the book itself. There wasn't any romance (at all) within the first half of the book, and the chemistry was lacking between the main characters (John and Jane) throughout. Their involvement with one another was unbelievable, and the circumstances they often found themselves in were extremely contrived. This was a disappointing book. I guess if you're a fan of the author you might be pleased, but only if you can tolerate a rather blah story."
3,Not her best work,"I was disappointed with this book. I have loved her past reads, and was excited to get my hands on this one. However, while reading it, the plot was confusing at times. I'm still not sure how it happened in the end - it certainly didn't satisfy me. It felt the the book was hurriedly written, and edited lightly. I found typos and a couple grammatical errors. While these are human errors, it happened enough times I was distracted from the story.The characters were only semi-believable to me. The premise just didn't seem to fit them. I had a hard time buying that in real life they might have fallen in love - just seemed a stretch."
5,Very entertaining - for adults too,"My almost two-year-old son loves this video. We watch it every evening and he sings and dances and even kisses them goodbye. The music is fun and familiar, and Sam Wright and his gang are lively and entertaining. If you can find it, make a copy to use later when it wears out. I assure you, it will."
1,Corporate Disney at its best...,All I keep thinking while watching this video is...The man Sam Wright is obviously on drugs.The kids dance well (maybe too well) at their age.And then I think. Disney package at its best.No educational value whatsoever.
3,Good clean family fun,Great game to play with the kids. Allows for good quality time and friendly trash talking as you compete against each other.
4,"Good, but beware!","There is no doubt that the sections written by Purdy (i.e. the annotated games) make this book a worthy purchase. But later sections of the book are not written by Purdy-they are by Ralph Tykodi-and they are useless. For instance the chapter with the intriguing title ""The road to 2000"" is basically an advertisement for the other books in the series-very very little practical advice. It seems that if Purdy had written a chapter on how to get to 2000 rating, it would be practical and useful: he was one of the greatest chess teachers of all time. But again-the sections written by Purdy (over a hundred games!) make the book worth it."
3,basic AR15 stuff,"Though the title is ""tactical"" it is really just basic information -- assembly, disassembly, sight options, drop in trigger job, etc."
4,Love this bag,"I needed a large bag with two babies under 2 years old and found this one. It is large enough to stuff everything you need and more! It has two insulated bottle pockets on the inside and one on the outside for easy access. The changing pad is a little small and was only used for a few months. It also has a front pocket for mommy (or daddy) to keep your personal belongings like phone, credit cards, etc. It is very comfortable to wear. The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars is because I tend to over-pack and because of this, the diaper bag does not stay closed, therefore, things fall out. It stays shut by one snap only. If you are someone like me, then I suggest a larger bag, but if you aren't one of us who brings everything but the kitchen sink then this is the bag for you."
4,Floyd,This is a good album if you are still relatively new to the whole gilman street punk scene. It introduced me to some really cool bands.
1,Return was a nightmare,"this product didn't work, when we called Lux to return the item we NEVER got any of our calls returned. After 5 attempts we finally got someone to give us a return number and we shipped it back. Then we waited and waited for the credit to hit our account and it never did. We disputed the item through our bank and they did a temp. credit for 60 days and attempted to contact Lux to resolve this. Lux never even contacted our bank to resolve the credit dispute. I would NEVER purchase something from this company!"
2,"The ""next"" button, on the Lux TX1500 programmable thermostat, wore out after a couple of uses.","The ""next"" button wore out after a couple of uses. Without a working ""next"" button you can no longer change any of the settings, and you really have to buy a new thermostat. The other buttons do not work well either; they are extremely sluggish. You feel really lucky when they work. It is too expensive for something that wears out that fast."
1,Bang-Bang control leaves you swetaing and freezing,"While it is easy to install and program, this thermostat uses bang-bang control (i.e. it either turns the heat full ON, or OFF) with a large hysteresis. This means if you set the temperature to i.e. 68 F, the heat will remain full ON until the room reaches 70. Then it will turn off until temperature drops below 66 before repeating the cycle. Turns out I can control the temperature better myself, to prevent the hot-cold shivers, I have to keep adjusting the temperature manually.A sensible thermostat would use some type of modulation, turning the heat on at intervals to maintain a steady temperature. The instruction sheet claims this thermostat would do that, but it doesn't."
1,Avoid this product,This thermostat has several problems which make me regret choosing it. I initially chose it because of a reccomendation from CR. I will buy a different brand next time.
5,Easy To Program,"I love this thermostat. I love having the programmed settings for when I know there will be no one home, and then if I happen to be to warm or too cold, I just hit the up or down button, and it changes. Then it automatically goes back to the program at the next time interval.It has weekday, Saturday, and Sunday programs, with 4 adjustable time intervals each day. These are also saved for the heat and for the a/c... which came in handy in the spring when when we wanted a/c during the day and would flip it to heat at night to keep the chill away.For the a/c...I keep it warmer during the day while my husband is at work, and run the ceiling fans. Then we cool it off a little extra at night so we sleep better.Our electric bill for our 2000 sq ft house is only slightly higher than for the 1000 sq ft apartment we moved from last year."
1,Backlight barely readable,"I bought this as an additional thermostat for another part of my home. I already have the CAG1500 which works great and has a great backlit display. This unit also works but the backlight is barely adequate to make out the legends. It's about half the brightness of the CAG. I'm going to return it back to Lowes for another, and if that isn't as bright as the CAG then back it goes too."
1,Wrong item and slow delivery,"I ordered the Lux TX1500 thermostat specifically from this vendor since they had a decent price. I waited almost three weeks and finally got the generic ACE electronic thermostat (something I could've purchased right down the street). I got the distinct impression that they had trouble getting the right item in stock and thought they could pacify me by sending me the same type product but not the exact one I ordered. The irritating thing was there was no documentation or receipt in the package, no explanation as to why I received the wrong item after such a long wait. The return process,like the ordering process, was very slow. They did finally send me a UPS return receipt so I didn't have to pay for shipping the thing back to them, but, after almost two months, I still don't have the thing I wanted...I think the odd thing is, their web site looks normal on the surface, but there are actually very few items available for purchase. Very few."
1,Bring on an editor!,Many anecdotes but few insights. I'm greatly interested in the period and will continue to slog through this book but it's been a disappointment so far. The lengthy recitations of incidents without much unifying explanation and little historical background of the era lead me to believe that Mr. Keneally missed a great opportunity to better enlighten his readers and enliven Dan Stickles who is a cardboard figure to me.
5,Compelling and Powerful,"Keneally is what many great historians aren't, a great story teller. He has a successful fiction writer's sense of how to spin a yarn so can't put the book down. Here, the lurid historical details of an extraordinary American life are stitched together in a way that makes it impossible not to become emotionally involved. Keneally's enchanting portrayal of Sickles' first wife, Therea, is so compelling that its emotional impact lingers long after you finish the read.This is a great read."
1,Not Really A Scoundrel,What a disappointment! Dan Sickles wasn't that bad of a guy! Sure he killed Barton Key but only after he had an affair with his wife under his nose and by doing so ridiculed him to Washington society. Defintely a crime of passion. I don't think the fact that he liked women makes him a scoundrel. Actually his treatment of Teresa after their split speaks well of him. He stayed with her and never got a divorce to protect his daughter. True they drifted apart later but hasn't that happened before in many families? His life was certainly colorful not much more so that the illustrious Bill Clinton. Is the author preparing a book on that scoundrel?
1,Wasted Effort,"The author appears to be more interested in General Stickes' first wife than with the General. Read his biography on any of the many web pages and you realize what an extraordinary person he was. The author devotes the greatest part of the book to the murder of Barton Key. Once past this eiposode, he seems to run out of material. Little mention is made of the relationship that the General must have had with the various Presidents that he served, the extended time he spent in Spain, or his second marriage. Better than waste your time reading this book search the internet for the General. Read the obituary and editorial of the NY Times at the time of his death to get a contemporary feeling as to the statue of this man."
2,Disappointing,"American Scoundrel is the disappointing biography of Dan Sickles, one of the most controversial 19th Century Americans. Politician, soldier, philanderer, and murderer, Sickles deserves a biography that explores his inner-workings. This book also is missing some of Sickles' key acts, such as influencing the outcome of the ""stolen"" election of 1876 by urging the Republican leaders in key states to hold on until the election could be swung. Say what you will about Sickles as a person, but he was always in the thick of things even after his infamous murder of the son of Francis Scott Key. Unfortunately Thomas Keneally does not deliver a gripping account of a compelling man. Maybe it's impossible to capture why Sickles often risked such a brilliant career for physical gratification, or why a man who was such a magnetic presence for others did not have a moral compass of his own."
3,It's Worth a Read.,"I was drawn to reading Keneally because of his authorship of ""Schindler's List"". As a result, I am grateful for becoming acquainted with Dan Sickles, which otherwise would never have happened. Sickles' life touched with and on many notable persons and events of the pre-civil war and civil war era. As a result, the reader is given the opportunity to see the period from a perspective which otherwise would not be affordedSickles definitely was a first class scoundrel and a third class person. His murder of Francis Scott Key's son is not the reason to classify Sickle's as a scoundrel. It's sad how one man could continually ruin other peoples lives and still come out smelling like a rose.Keneally is an excellent writer. I often felt I was reading fiction, which made the book that much more enjoyable."
3,"Oh, What it Might Have Been","Keneally's book on Dan Sickles seems to have been written for the consumption of a popular audience. Unfortunately, Keneally has produced a hastily-written book about a fascinating era of American morality. The book is not without some merit. Dan Sickles was an adulterous politician who chose to kill his wife's lover. Stanton, his principal attorney, boiled with outrage in court against Barton Key's abuses--while at the same time acting as a sugar daddy for a girl in New York City. Comparing/contrasting the hypocrisy of 1859 with 2002 would have been a wonderful technique, but it was one at which Keneally only hinted.This could have been a great book: As it is, it is fair but still thought-provoking."
4,A fascinating and tragic story,"This well-sourced biography of the Gettysburg general who literally got away with murder (shooting his wife's lover in cold blood and successfully pleading, for the first time in American history, temporary insanity) is extraordinarily interesting, whether you consider yourself a Civil War buff or not. The controversy over Gen. Sickles' actions at Gettysburg continues to fascinate scholars 150 years later. My only complaint is that the prose is occasionally confusing and ambiguous. Several times, I was stopped by a sentence in this book and tried in vain to puzzle out what the author meant. But by and large, this account is highly recommended."
2,A Great Story In Search of Another Way To Tell It,"This book was deeply disappointing to me. While the story was potentially fascinating (a Civil War hero who had previously murdered the district attorney of Washington, D.C.), it might have been better told as a novelization, rather than a biography. The stiff, formal style of writings of the era, both public and private, stiffle the potentially interesting stories of not only Dan Sickles, but both his wives and his daughter.Moreover, the book could have used a better editor. Too many times the same line gets repeated: e.g., the beautiful Creole wife of a Louisiana senator. Also, photographs are referenced, such as a famous battlefield photograph of Matthew Brady or a photograph of Theresa Sickles, but, alas, none are supplied. Perhaps someone will buy the rights to this book and make it into a servicable movie. That, not this book, would be worth the price."
3,DISSAPPOINTING,"Maybe a change of title, modified if you will to say, 'Use of Insanity Defense' because the bulk of the book is on Sickle's trial for killing the son of Francis Scott Key who was having an affair with Sickles wife. A very interesting read, that section, but that's the book. The rest of the life is left almost hanging waiting for more. The Civil War Hero General Dan Sickles is written like fill in stuff and the other parts of the man's life are all but an after thought. I was very disappointed that more wasn't here, more research. Sickles was a confidant of Lincoln, Governor of the Carolina's during Reconstruction, a U.S. Ambassador, Congressman and general, we wanted more information."
2,"A Civil War ""tale"", not history.","If you are interested in the American Civil War, this is not the book for you. Keneally fails to understand the core audience for this book, Civil War aficionados, and is erroneous in his basic facts surrounding important events. The focus is the scandal surrounding Sickles and his young bride and not the historical events of the day."
5,Well detailed gripping account of pure hell,"This work takes you from an outline of the Pacific war so far, through the crucial planning stages, detailing the lack of imformation about the objective that was to prove fatal to so many good men and culminates in a blow by blow account of the action itself. Many eye witness testimonies bring the action to life and you find yourself along side them, sheltering behind the bullet raked log sea wall, out of water, with no way forward and no way back. But you are one of the lucky ones. All around you is the chaos of an assault from the sea. LVT's wrecked and burning, riddled with bullet holes, dead floating in the lagoon by the hundred, but the tiny island had to be taken at any cost.Gripping stuff from cover to cover, many black and white photos, useful maps and informative, orders of battle and other appendices. I highly recommend it to any historian or enthusiast of World War Two in the Pacific."
4,Amazing!,"I am always astounded by sheer brazen courage of men under fire. This book takes you there from start to finish you are in the heat of the battle. You can almost sense the horror the Marines felt wadding ashore, weapons held high, while enemy machine guns ripped them to pieces! That they endured such horrendous cost and ultimately triumphed over a deeply entrenched enemy is nothing short of miraculous. If you seek the truth about the awful battle for Taraww this is the book for you. I highly recommend it."
5,Secrets of the vine devotional,"Excellent book, get any corrosponding book must have for your christian growth. All women and men can gain from this a better understanding of Gods promises."
3,Wrong book,I wanted the original edition on kindle. I have the book and I like it however it is good to carry it with me.
5,Good Book,"This is the follow-up to The Prayer of Jabez, if you liked that book, you will like this one too."
3,DVD review,"While I won't make the project demonstrated in this video, I did learn a couple techniques I've already used on other quilts.I think I would have gotten more use out of a book vs. the DVD."
2,E-Z Listening,"Somewhat denatured instros of originally vocal-centered numbers, slowed for dancing. Like what a combo would be playing on a cruise for first class dinner-dance, nothing offensive except digital spiking of what is intended as smooth sound. (Especially the winds.) A step below ""beautiful music"". Have heard Beach Boys in concert 3 times in past decade and hardly would recognize as the same songs except for trained music pattern recognition. For instrumental covers of group suggest Hollyridge Strings treatment instead."
2,"TERRIBLE SCRIPT, GOOD NUDITY","After most of the Earth was destroyed by a meteor, there exists a boot camp of New America in the Arctic. Now there seems to be people living in other areas, but we never get a feel for that. Ryan Murphy (Mario Lopez) shows up at this boot camp because his friend is missing plus there are odd things going on. (I liked this plot better when it involved prison girls.) Richard Grieco plays a psychotic Sargent, who idolizes Nixon. Murphy is assigned to Echo Group and immediately doesn't fit in. Somehow pretty females are allowed to go into the cadet's barracks for drunken comfort sessions including Jamie Pressly who makes love to Ryan Murphy on his extra wide army cot. It is nudity which deserves four stars, but the movie stank so bad I could only muster 2 stars in spite of Jamie's perky effort. Did I mention the aliens and the molecular transport which caused the disaster? An MST-3000 candidate."
3,Depends on what you are looking for.,"There are 3 types of people this movie will appeal to. Gay men, women hard up to see built men in their skivvies and die-hard Jaime Pressly fans (the last one would be me). If you're looking for a story or even a cheesy B movie to have fun with then look elsewhere. The main goal of this movie is to show men in their underwear. For me the nude love scene with Jaime Pressly for a few minutes in the prime of her prime look wise was worth the cheap price of the movie. Don't go thinking you are going to get anything like Poison Ivy the new seduction with this movie. There is only the one scene.I was disappointed that after waiting forever for this to be released on DVD that they didn't do it in widescreen. I was hoping that they included both wide and full on the DVD but no such luck. I also have the region 2 copy of this movie and it is in widescreen, but it only plays on my computer not in my DVD player."
5,"Macho, well-scrubbed hunks.","A previous rewiewer has said it well: The plot is silly. The only reason to see this movie is the striking young men who jock around being cadets in their underwear or less. If you like this, go for it. It was enough to make me buy the movie and see it twice. As I think about it, I believe I'll go home and see it again. Maybe with the sound off; it won't make that much difference.Sometimes one wants a plot with one's hunks, and a good choice for this is ""Moon Base 44"" with Michael Pare. The hunks are older than in ""Absolution"" and not so well scrubbed, in spite of the shower scene, but the plot is downright interesting.Of course, the best science fiction/hunk movie at present is ""12 Monkeys,"" in which Brad Pitt and a surprisingly well-built Bruce Willis bare all for their art. This would be engrossing even without the nudity."
1,Disappointed,"This is the second time I have tried a re-manufactured product. This is a different brand that I have tried and am still disapointed. This product is not packaged in the green-boxed ""Focus"" brand packaging as shown. The print is poor quality, very light, and not crisp. I need to set my printer properties on ""best quality"" to get fair results. I relied on the previous reviews, however in my experience it seems you still have to pay top dollar for an OEM product to GUARANTEE good results."
4,surprisingly good color output.,"Purchased for my Grade school son that wanted to print a few items, took my very old HP printer out, (this model will never dye with very little care). cleaned and added this ink, he was able to print his pictures from his toy camera just fine. Not to be mistaken with true dead on HP ink. but for what I am using it for, I am very, very pleased. I would and will likely repurchase this product again, for as long as my son wants to use that printer."
1,VERY INFERIOR PRODUCT,"I bought the double pack, black and color, and the first few prints from the color were fine, but, after that, things went steadily downhill. This is an inferior product and not worth any money. Don't buy this product."
2,Not such a good deal,Purchased the Focus ink cartrages in June and was happy with the quality of the color. Did not use the black until today 11/13/10 and found it dry. Also the color is finished. Find the HP lasts much longer. so maybe this is not as a good deal as I thought it would be. Have gone back to the HP.foolish me didn't read this and bought them again. The color was empty returned it and received a replacement used it twice and again no color. Must read the reviews more carefully. Save your money.
3,Good Value but not perfect,"Bought these for an HP 895CXI printer. The printer alignment could not be performed on the vertical B section (B1-B11). Having said that, the print test page came out ok and the print quality looks very good and is fine for my use (average printing of web pages)"
2,"Has some good insights, but ...","As a deeply committed Christian (and preaching pastor) and an animal lover, this is a topic that is near and dear to my heart, so I was prepared to like this book. I really didn't, though. Part of the reason is that the book touts itself as bringing ""a Biblical basis for the Humane Treatment of Animals"" to the table, but in the end, is less than fully Biblical. Specifically, the author does not accept the full inspiration of scripture and wrestle with the texts accordingly; instead, he tends to accept as ""inspired"" anything that supports his thesis, however tangentally, and disregard anything that doesn't. This leads to a lot of playing ""fast and loose"" with the texts.Besides this, though, I really do have to complain that, to this reader, anyway, the overall tone of the book was just sort of smug. A much better book on the topic is Andrew Linzey's Christianity and the Rights of Animals."
3,Windows and Morning Toast,Plesant piano hovering between restaurant background and morning toast without coffee. Not exciting enough for guests. Appropriate for a rainy day if you want to keep the rainy day mood.
4,Joey Pigza Swallowed The Key,"I have read all of the Joey Pigza books, but this one was my favorite. In this book Joey Pigza, a wired little kid with ADHD (attention defecit hyper disorder)is introduced to the reader. Joey Pigza's parents are divorced, just like mine. Joey Pigza isn't the most focused student in school. So his teacher sends him to the special class. He doesn't like this special class at all. When Joey gets to go back to regular class, he trips and cuts off the tip of a girl's nose. After that Joey is forced to go to a special school and his teacher's name is Ed, Special Ed."
2,What a weird book!,"This, I think, is the weirdest book I've ever read! He does some crazy things, such as swallowing his key to house just for the fun of it! One part really made me cringe. That's when he's sharpening pencils. He decides he wants to have sharp fingernailsjust like vampires. So he sharpens his nail and it rips his fingernail right off!Ugh!"
1,I Really Disliked This Book,This book did not appeal to me. Even after he got medicine his actions were not very good. I thought this book was boring. It started boring and ended boring.
5,JOEY PIGZA SWALLOW THE KEY,"Joey pigza can't sit still. He can't pay attention. He can't follow the rules, and he can't help it-especially when he was born. He has problems jus like his dad and grandma have. And whether he's wreaking havoc on a class trip or swallowing his house key, Joey's problems are getting worse. In fact, his behavior is so off the wall that his teachers are threatening send him to the special-ed center downtown. Joey knows he's really a good kid, but no matter how hard he tries to do the right thing, something always seems to go wrong. Will he ever get anything right?"
3,Joey Pigza Swalled the Key,I really like this book. Joey is a funny guy and so is all the other charactars. I like this book so much that I started reading another Joey Pigza book.
4,Joey Pigza,"Joey is the main character in the book. Joey has trouble sitting still in class. He goes to a special ed school for cutting off Maria's nose. He is very funny and I like him alot. Although the things he does are silly and sometimes stupid, I still like him. This is a very funny, funny book."
3,What will Joey do?,Joey Pigza can't stay still. He always has to move. He has ADHD.I would recommend this book to anyone because it is funny and sad in the begining of the book.The author is Jack Ganton.This book is interesting because it is about a boy who can't stay still and his dad ran away and his mom went after him. She came back for Joey. In the end Joey Pigza began to take pills. Did or did not the pills help him?
4,Help with ADHD,"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key is a very informational book on the affects and behaviors of ADHD. Joey Pigza is a ten year old boy suffering from thiscondition. Since birth, he has been ""wired"" and his behavior has been uncontrollable. I reccomend this book to both parents and students so they know how to deal with ADHD.It's a fun story and a great helper."
3,Joey Pigza review,Joey Pigza Swallowed the key is very funny and sometimes sad. Joey has ADHD and cant sit still. So what will he do to stay out of trouble? I think it can help people understand people who have ADHD. Then for kids who have ADHD it lets them learn how to behave. So Joey Pigza is very informative. If you have ADHD or knowsomeone that does it is a must read.
4,The Life of Joey Pigza,"What Would Joey Do / Harper Collins, 229 pp., $5.99Jack Gantos / ISBN 0-06-054403-1There's no doubt about it, Joey Pigza is wired. From cutting peoples noses off to swallowing keys, he's pretty crazy. He and his mom live together in Rhode Island. His drunken dad and his mean grandmother live in Pennsylvania. And he is stuck going to a school that he doesn't fit in. Joey just wants a normal life and for his parents to be normal. But that doesn't happen. He gets sent to a ""special school"" for his bad behavior and gets new meds so he can stay in control. But when his meds wear off he's the same old Joey."
3,Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key,"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key is an okay book. Joey Pigza is a kid who has ADD. He was living with his grandma until his mom came back. His grandma left and his mom took care of him from then on. His mom worked every day and when he got home from school she was still working. So his mom decided to give him a house key, bad idea. A few days later he was at school playing around with his key and he swallowed it. After his regular teacher saw that happen she sent him to the Special Ed room."
1,my book report for class about joey pigza,"joey is a smart kid and is very messed up. he has ad/hd and his grandma is crazy. He cuts of marias nose and goes crazy at a farm. People call him zippy because hes hyper and is very skinny. His mom comes back and he gets a chahuahau. He names it pablo. he ends up swiching from pills to a patch because his pills dont work. At the end of the story he gets to say the pledge of allegience on the loud speaker he also says, ""IM JOEY PIGZA AND IM BACK IM BACK IM BACK."" then the principle tells him to stop and pulls the mic out of his hand. this is a very good book i recomend it to any body my brother likes it and hes a freshman in highschool. thanx 4 readin"
1,it can be offensive to people that have disorders,"just don't read it, it can be offensive -i mean hes very crazy it has a author who doesn't know what he is writing about and makes people with disorders look like freaks!"
1,DON'T READ!,"This was one of the most disgusting books I have ever read. The author couldn't describe things weirder. He describes something as `turd flavored' and he couldn't get the more grosser and embarrassing looks of humans. This is a strange, deranged book."
3,joey pigza swallows the key,"I thought the book was very good but unrealistic in some parts. i also thought that the book had some gross parts in it. but overall it was a very good book and i was never bored reading it!written by Elizabeth, Josee, Laurie Ann , and Lindsey!"
4,Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key Book Review,"When I read Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key it got me hooked.I think Joey is an interesting kid with some misunderstood problems. I gave this four stars because it was a funny book that involved a good kid that did some bad things. I've never read any of Jack Gantos books, but I'd love to read more of his books. It's a very funny book that any kid would love to read. So please read this book about a kid that has ADHD, but will be an OK kid! Book review by Austin,Bobby, Adam, and Sam"
3,Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key Review,"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key was a good book because he kept us on our feet. We thought that what he did was funny. We also liked when Joey went crazy over the shoofly pie. We learned that everyone is the same on the inside. We mostly learned about ADD and ADHD.Review by: Andrew, Matt, Reid, and Braxton"
4,Mike's Review,This is a good book for 5th grade kids. It tells and shows how people with ADD act. It shows how you can overcome ADD and use it positively.Joey was my favorite character. I liked that he was funny and at times acted crazy. His grandmother was weird because you never knew if she was going to be nice or mean. She was my least favorite character.I gave this book a good rating because it is a good story plus I learned a lot about ADD.
4,Joy Pigza,This book is a great book from when he eats the key until the amish fild trip. I hily recomend this book because it is funny the carictors are wierd.
3,Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key,"This is a story about a boy who has ADD. He just can't sit stll.He tries to pay attention in school but he just can't. Joey does things he just doesn't control. Some examples are when someone ask's him a question he'll say ""Can I get back to you on that!"" He Swallows a key. He goes to an Amish farm.Then he eats a pie which makes him crazy. He even cut's off a girl's nose. He tries to get in control but he just can't!!!!"
4,Joey Pigza,This book is very funny and I liked it a lot. This book is very interesting to read and I really wanted to know what was going to happen next. I hope there will be another serias of this book.
3,Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key,"Joey Pigza is a fouth grader at a normal public school in a little county in Pennsylvania. Joey is not a normal kid. He has a hyperactive disease that he inherited from his father, whom lives in Pitsburgh. His mother left when he was young. So he now lives with his grandmother who is very uncapable of caring for Joey. At school Joey has some problems with behaving so he is sent to the Learning Disability class. Then a big accident happens and Joey is sent to a Special Ed. school. During this his mother comes home and his grandmother leaves for Pitsburgh. Joey and his mother then go to Pitsburgh to try out a new medicine which works very well. He then goes back to public school and is a ""normal kid"". I hope you enjoy ""Joey Pigza Swallowed The Key""."
4,Walking in Joey's Shoes,"This was a moving and informative story of a boy who tells what it's like living ""wired"". He has ADD and finds that he is at the mercy of his disability. He realizes that he knows the rules, but he just can't remember them. When he becomes ""dangerous"" to others, he is sent away for serious help. I liked the teacher, Special Ed, who rescues him and enables him to return to his regular school environment. I found this story funny, sad, and appealing, never boring. Gantos gives good insight as to how it feels to be out of control."
2,Joey Pigza swallowed a key,Joey is a hyper kid and he has to take medican to calm down. His mom just came back and her mom is incontrol. His gandma dissapered when he ( Joey) lost it ! He is very hyper in class to! His teacher said that he has to sedal down. So when his teacher went out of the class room he was chaseing a girl and he had sisors and cut the tip of her nose ! He is now in special-Ed class the next day he went to the girls house to appolagize ! And at the end he found out he is not such a bad kid
2,Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key,"Joey Pigza has problems and doesn't deal with them very well. He's crazy. He just can't sit still. He goes to an Amish farm. He eats a pie, he jumps off a haystack, and hurts his leg.He even cuts off a girl's nose.I probably would not recommend this book."
2,Weird joey goes trouble,"This story takes place sometime in the present in Joey's house and school. But most of the accidents that Joey has happen in his school.This book is mostly about a boy named Joey Pigza. Since Joey was born he was trouble. But when he turns older he turns weird. So he has to take medicine to cotroll him. Sometimes it doesn't work and he destroys everything that bothers him.Joey lives with his grandma.In this story she gets lost.In my opinion this book wasn't excited for me.Not even funny.I would not recommened this book because is not educational,funny,or exciting."
3,3/5 Stars (OK book),"This book about a hyperactive kid is an OK book. It teaches how even if the person seems incurably bad, they still sometimes can be really good. This book also teaches about acceptance and how other people can accept such a different person.This book was not the best book I've ever read. I rate it 3/5 stars because I sort of liked the book, but it wasn't the best book I've read. Some parts of it are somewhat boring, but a lot of people will enjoy this book."
2,a fascinating glorification fo the crumbling american empire,"almost everything that is wrong with are societies treatment of children, a standardized and frankly boring school system, kids put on mind altering and probably brain damaging drugs at earlier and earlier ages and Children being raised by institutions rather then parents. The books message is that children should be taken away from there parents, drugged and monitored and controlled to an Orwellian degree. Certainly a fascinating read, but as someone who was put on the pills that are parsed in this novel and put through the room 101 that is this country's special education system i can tell you that you should NEVER under any circumstances take it's advice."
3,joey pigza swallowed the key,"This book is the most funniest and kind of sad, book I lovedMr. Jack your a very good writter I never imagined I mean itsvery good, I read this book to my cousins and they loved itvery much, thanks to you, now they love books"
4,Joey Is a Quick and Easy Read,"I really enjoyed the book, but was a little disappointed as Joey began to get treatment. The book started out as very funny with Joey describing what hyeractivity felt like. But near the end, the book took on a more serious mood as Joey got on the right medications and made friends with other handicapped kids."
3,Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key,"This book, Joey Pigza Swaloed the key is an educational and funny book that readers will enjoy. It is written from the piont of view of Joey Pigza. He is a 10 year old boy born with ADHD. Readers will learn about ADHD and how it effects people. I learned alot of things from the novel and so can you."
4,Joey Pigza that's Who!,"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key is a novel about an ADHD diagnosed child that deserves four stars. Joey Pigza, a ten year old student that attends Mrs. Maxy's class, has exemplary courage for a kid with an Attention Defeceit Hyperactive Disorder.

5,A Better Way,"In the past, I have avoided brown rice, although I knew it was much better than white rice from a healthy eating standpoint, because I just couldn't get into the taste and texture. While this blend does not have a significantly different texture, the taste and aroma are wonderful. Rice is a large part of the Southern diet and this blend takes dishes to a new level. Following the cooking directions will yield a perfect product, not gummy, but very satisfying, especially for a meatless diet or entree."
3,Tasty but pricey,"A little expensive as a steady staple compared to brown rice or barley. If you're looking for fiber it has twice that per serving of brown rice, but 40% of barley. Interesting texture. Regular rice eaters could find it a taste treat."
5,One of the best rice blends I've ever tasted,"In an attempt to make my diet less dependent upon simple carbs, I've been shopping for whole grain products that don't taste like sand, cardboard or twigs and pebbles. RiceSelect has come up with a clear winner with this blend of three different grain products: Two types of rice, barley and rye. It has a warm, comforting quality, good flavor and is just loaded with the kind of fiber we all need. You could do a lot worse and believe me, I have.Try cooking it in stock or broth and adding just a touch of butter and salt. I make mine in my rice cooker (If you eat a lot of grains, get one. Trust me on this, you'll thank me in the end. Zojirushi makes some of the best.) and it's a nearly no-fuss operation. Ingredients in, cooker on, walk away. Come back to an amazing meal."
1,Metal is Very Fragile,"I was pleased with the product upon receiving it, but I was disappointed when after the second day, the bottom of the ""weeder"" bent while using it. I was able to straighten the end but it has been weak since that time. If the metal was more sturdy that is inserted in the ground, I would have rated this a 5."
1,Do not buy this weeder!,"This weeder looked great in the store and worked very well ... until the steel tip bent ... which happened almost immediately. It's easy to straighten out, but I didn't expect to have to do that after every dandelion that's a bit reluctant to let me pull it up. And eventually, the metal will fatigue and break off due to the frequent bending and straightening. A metal tip this soft shouldn't have a handle more than about a foot long. But better yet, a handle as substantial as this one should have a tip that is compatible with it so a person can get some real yard work done.Bottom line: do NOT buy a Seymour brand dandelion/lawn weeder."
1,Seymour Dandelion Weeder,"I was very pleased to find this tool, because I had lost my much-loved and long-used tool of similar design. I was a little suspicious of the low price, however. My first hint that it is not well made was when I removed the cardboard covering on the bottom blade--the tool end came out of the casing. I put it back in and tried the tool on a Poke weed, which has a similar growth habit to dandelions. While I was using the prying motion to unearth the weed, the tool bent. I wasn't able to extract the weed, so I returned the tool immediately. My local ACE hardware store was very sympathetic and refunded my money.This tool is simply a poor replica of a better tool."
4,Run with the big dogs.,"I was leary to try this, even though there was one good review. I agree that this is not the equal of the $300 PZM but it can perform. The pictures don't do it justice. Looks like a toy but in your hand the weight is sufficient to keep the mic in place. I rated it 4 stars as I felt the included cable was a little light weight. Other than that our tests showed even pickup throughout the 110 degree arc. There was dropoff beyond the 110 arc and hardly any pickup at 180 degrees. Distance range was good for the 15 feet that we had on the stage. Just ordered 2 more today."
3,Not as good as others in the series and more expensive,"A large portion (perhaps 1/4) of the book is the Introduction. The stories are good (not fantastic), but for $15 I would like more stories and less explination. We own the Russian Gypsy Folk Tales book from this series and it is excellent. This book pales in comparison."
1,Waste of time,"This book is full of self-evident platitudes. Additionally, this book is incredibly overpriced. It is paperback and less than 400 pages, but at the time of writing it is selling for $63. This book is worth $10 maybe. If that.Verdict: don't bother. It will not help you."
2,Poor job done of a truly good dramatic story,"It's a shame that the author wrote ""a story based on the lives..."" It would have been a better book if he had simply told the story as it really happened. I personally knew Gene Viernes and Silme Domingo and it's very disappointing that Churchhill did not do justice to their story."
3,kitchen,i like most of the roles played by michael kitchen too bad there was not another episode of this it kind of leaves you wondereing what he will do
1,Quite a disappointment,"I guess because I loved Michael Kitchen in Foyle's War, I thiught this would be as good. But he plays a negative character in this and I didn't like it all."
5,Well Done Suspense Thriller !,"This was a great movie with superb acting. It was difficult to watch Michael Kitchen in the role of a scoundrel after having viewed his performance in the complete Foyle's War series. Nevertheless, it was a great performance. I was totally engrossed in the film from beginning to end and there were many surprises and unexpected turns. I watched the entire film in one sitting and was glad that I did, it was engrossing and entertaining. Now I need to find more films like this one. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story and quality acting."
4,Well worth watching,"Although, there are too many coincidences, this is still well worth watching. Michael Kitchen is such an excellent actor.He comes across as a complicated human being, even though he is responsible for something truly evil, and that is not the rape. At the end, one wonders how many judges and lawyers are dispensing ""justice"" and are guilty of their own crimes."
3,Wonderfully acted but simply not possible,"Without giving too much away, this is a thoroughly engrossing drama, especially if you like or are not troubled by stories where justice is not necessarily the outcome. The problem for me was that the coincidences in this story are so many layers deep it's like hearing somebody won the lottery four times in the same day."
5,excellent arrangements of holiday music,"I was very impressed with the arrangements as well as the selection of pieces in this book. The arrangements are simple enough for a relative beginner to play, but are so pleasant that they could be used for any one wishing to play a 2 to 3 part piece on a holiday occasion. I thought that I was familiar with most of the more common international carols, so I was suprised at the number of unfamiliar ones. My daughter's violin teacher and I tried out every piece and every harmony in this book as well as books 2 and 3. They were all thoroughly delightful."
5,Just as i thought,This product is the typical nose pad product that I have always used until I couldn't find it at the pharacy anymore. Thank goodness for Amazon. Thank you
1,Misleading product info,"These pads look like replacements for your worn out eyeglasses silicone nose pads, but are in fact a sticky backed (weak adhesive) foam pad. Entirely useless and they last for about half a day. Good thing they include ten, that might make it through a week!"
3,Works good but lasts only 2 or 3 days,"Product arrived on time and was as advertised except for one thing. The peach nose pads don't stay stuck to the existing nose pads for more than 2 or 3 days. I tried washing the existing pads with soap and water and with alcohol to remove any oil. I also tried slightly scratching the existing pads to roughen the surface but nothing helped to keep the Peach Nose Pads stuck on them. Other ratings have warned of this but I was despirate to find something that would prevent the slipping. It gets expensive to continue to purchase lots of packages of them. I only use them for important functions where I need something sort of invisible. Otherwise I use the only methods that work - Crookies Tite End eyewear retainers which has a sliding bead that pulls them tite behind your head (a bit ugly) and the Flents Sports Band Elastic Eyeglass Holder for Active People (a bit tight and hard to get on and ugly). With these two products pulled tight, my eyeglasses never slip."
1,Totaly Useless,"I applied these pads exactly as directed. Put my glasses on, found them to be moderately uncomfortable and when I took my glasses off the pads stayed on my nose. Several more attempts resulted in similar results."
2,nose pads,"These nose pads are nice and thick which was what i needed for glasses that keep sliding down my nose but the pink color and thickness make them very noticeable on my face while wearing rimless glasses. While they work beautifully, I would be embarassed to wear them in public."
4,Buy it if you like any of the T'Pau songs you've heard!,"I like this album. It contains 17 tracks with a total playing time of over 70 minutes. I don't have any of T'Pau's other albums, so I don't know if these songs are their best. But I know most of them are good and some are fantastic. I love the ""China In Your Hand"", ""Whenever You Need Me"" and ""Bridge Of Spies"". This is a very good album that I think you will like if you like any of the T'Pau songs you've heard."
2,NOT Worth the Money,"My son was so excited to get this toy, until we got it home. He hates the headset and is constantly stepping on it (hence the 5 stars for durability) and Scramblers headset keeps falling off. My son happens to be think that ALL of the pieces need to be in place, so we were constantly chasing after the toy to put this piece back on. You also have to be pretty close for the remote to work, almost a bonus since it can't get too far away from him, and it has to be pointed straight at the car. I do think it is cute and a good idea, but the headset really needs to be an option because the headband is an odd shape and not very adjustable. The only head that thing will fit is about as round as Bob's. We've only had Scrambler a few days and my son is starting to lose interest."
1,Waste of Money,"This remote control car is so cute and is certainly a cute idea. But, Scrambler's mock headset doesn't stay on so I super glued it on. I have no idea why it was made to be removeable anyway. The headset, although slightly adjustable, still doesn't fit my son's head which makes it even more difficult to hear the audio which is hard to hear anyway! This car is so cute and I was highly disappointed to see that you can only direct it forward and backward! Why you cant go left and right is beyond me. Overall this toy was highly disappointing."
4,Also glad to have it!,"My 22 mth old son LOVES this toy! Other reviewers mention not being able to go right or left. Not true. The DIAMOND shaped pad is probably the culprit. It takes some getting used to. However, even that is not a huge problem or a deal breaker. I think they designed it to be SIMPLE, by just having one button for movement. Although it may not be the easiest, it doesn't seem to bother my son who loves to play with it! I do wish the sounds would work even without the headset. (My son just won't keep the headset on.) Overall, while not perfect, it was still worth it. Very durable (he throws it everywhere and has even tried to maneuver it down the stairs!) The cutest feature is that it bounces when it drives. That sets it apart from other remote control vehicles!"
1,Constantly resetting on and off switch,"This toy is recommended for 3+. I have a son who is almost 3 and he received this for Christmas. The movement of the toy is extremely fun. It moves just like the one on the show. It kind've rocks as it moves. It has a lot of power and will actually try to go up and over things. However, I have three problems. Like the other reviewer, the cord length, it was actually rapped around my 10 month old daughters neck last night. The second problem is that the headphones keep falling off my sons head when he uses them and he has a hard time putting them back on his head right so, therefore, he has to have me help him. The third problem is the most frustrating and that is that everytime he wants to play with it it has to be turned from on to off back to on. He can't figure out why it's not working when he presses the buttons so I have to see him trying to play with it before he gets so frustrated that it won't work that he walks away from it."
5,The Hitchhikers Guide to...Whoops wrong series!,"While Dragonstar relies more on hard science than actual fantasy it still can be a bewildering place to play around in. The prestige classes and feats in this book help to define your character in the Dragonstar universe as well as new paths for your character to take. Including the Way of the Wolf. Maybe not the actual title but the Companion introduces a new way to spend a given characters hard won XP: Training! With the investiture of experience points and time a given character can develop new abilities and new ways to improve themselves. Options galore is what this book hs in store. No matter how much you love or loathe the Dragonstar setting, some of the material is deffinately worth stealing for something else. All in all a wonderful tool kit for players and GMs alike."
3,Pretty good!,"The Player's Companion introduces many new and different things to add to the game, such as Legendary classes, or school training. It makes a very good supplement, and can really give characters a unique identity."
5,"Delightful, silly book children will love","This delightful book features a police force of foxes keep in practice by the Town Burglars who rob a store each month. This time around, the police are surprised by the Foreman Burglar. In the end, they are all heroes.What makes this book so great is the illustrations and the silly storyline. Any child under the age of 8 years old will more than likey love these characters. I know my son does and so do all his classmates."
4,Love guitar,"Good, easy listening, travel music for listening while I drive. I also put it on my MP3 player which goes with me everywhere."
2,Monontonous,"I found this CD to be disappointing. It is neither rhythmic not relaxing, just monotonous. I would not recommend it."
3,Windham Hill 25 Years of Guitar,Listenable - but it doesn't compare to the Windham Hill trio of Taylor Guitars 'Sounds of Wood & Steel' volumes 1-3
5,Very relaxing and soothing,"You will recognize the artists on this compilation CD. The songs are mellow and very relaxing,perfect for quiet day or evening."
5,Always Windham Hill,"Even though it has duplicate recordings from other cd's, I never seem to get tired of the classics. A few surprises in this one I haven't heard before."
5,Montero's Moment !,"Probably one of the ""other"" best male vocal performers to come out of Mexico...The other one is Alejandro Fernandez. Still, Montero is in a distinct class of his own with his light almost-baritone voice. He soars on such numbers like track 5 with it's traditional bolero/mariachi dramatic feel ! Here, he sounds like Alejandro Fernandez when Fernandez made his debut in the early 90's...but enough of the comparisons. What this collection of beautifully crafted and sung Spanish tracks offer are a richly entrancing atmosphere of being on vacation in a beautiful land with that someone special !"
4,A forest for every home!,"Since reading Robert Hart's classic book I have seen forest gardens sustaining life in Mexico, Fiji, Australia, South Africa and Britain. Around the world perennial 'home gardens' have been grown for millennia. Yet in temporate climates we seem to have forgotten how. This book has inspired me to increase the diversity and productivity of my own small garden in England, so far with good results. It is inspirational, but it is also practical. The Appendices offer suggestions for a variety of uses and climates. I would recommend as a companion volume, Patrick Whitefield's 'How to Grow a Forest Garden' for further details of the practicalities. But Hart's desciption of his own forest garden at Wenlock Edge stands alone and is an invaluable guide to practical sustainability."
4,Inspiring but not Practical,"Robert Hart's book on Forest Gardening is very inspiring, but more research is needed to start your garden. The list of suppliers in the Appendix is very helpful for those in North America, and the list of cultivars includes little known but very useful varieties. Overall, the book helps one understand the why of forest gardening but not the how to."
3,An interesting read but not much practical information,"As others have said, if you'd actually like to grow a forest garden, get something more useful, such asHow to Make a Forest Garden; or, if you can afford it and want really in-depth information,Edible Forest Gardens: Ecological Vision, Theory For Temperate Climate Permacultureand/orEdible Forest Gardens, Vol. 2: Ecological Design And Practice For Temperate-Climate Permaculture."
3,Good but lacking,"The author states in his introduction that this is not a ""how to"" book. If you are looking for a helpful book to get you started in forest gardening, this is probably not the book for which you are looking. However, if you just want to read about others who have created forest gardens and their reasoning/philosophy for doing so, this will probably be a good book to read."
3,"Pearl Jam's Story... Cliffnotes, w/ Great Pictures","""The story of Pearl Jam"" by Brad Morrel, is less a reading book than a photo album. The ""history"" contained within appears to be just a summary of the highlights in the actual history of PJ up to the release of ""No Code."" ... I think that most of the info here are cliffnotes from other more insightful and developed books like ""None to Fragile"" or ""Five Against One.""But on the other hand, the pictures contained within are colour, bigger than a letter sized paper, and spread out through 64 pages mostly from the pre-ten, ten, vs, and pre-vitalogy era.If you are a fan, and do not like reading long books, this is an ideal book for you.If you are a fan, and dont want text, but want some great early PJ pics, this is a good book for you. And if you want text, get one of the books i mentioned above.In my case, i own this book for the pictures and ""none too fragile"" for the text. This suits me well."
5,Intriuging band for the indie/postrock crowd,After hearing just a few tracks on !!!'s self titled album I was very impressed. I'd attempt to describe !!! as being the clash meets funk meets dance. I'm a big fan of the groove feel to their stuff. Funky bass lines meet equally funky guitars and horns complete with percussion breakdowns all with a decidedly non mainstream feel. The lyrics and vocal style are uniqe and keep this act somewhat mysterious. Toe tappin' stuff.
3,Digs deep in a shallow way,"3 1/2Indie groovester's !!! embrace the funk as whole heartedly as any electric rock band I've heard, but a few setbacks infect the potentially ridiculous flow. The vocals will be somewhat of an acquired taste, which wouldn't be a problem if they did not suffer typical over-indulgences. Ditto to the actual grooves themselves, as !!! concentrate on hammering riffs past the comfort zone rather then composing them. Ultimately the lack of restraint works wonders around some tight guitar playing, warranting the band future notice."
2,"Shoot for ""Louden Up Now""","With the exception of 'There's No ** Rules, Dude', this album doesn't do !!! much justice as far as their style of funk/dance music goes. The tracks are a bit too straighforwardly dancy which somewhat ruins the best aspect of the band seen in ""Louden Up Now"".As far as new dancy bands go, like Franz Ferdinand and the Killers, these guys have them beat no matter what. For fans of Radio 4, the Rapture, and Measles Mumps Rubella, if you're looking to get into these guys, check out ""Louden Up Now"" for your money's worth."
3,Meh,Reasonable punk/funk. Singer is unskilled. Lyrics occasionaly laps into childish strings of expletives. Good for a work out.
2,The revolution is over.,"Revolution marks a change since his lovely ""People"" album. Unfortunetely, change isn't always better. In fact, the entire album becomes redundant after a while. Where ""People"" had a great blend of electric and basic rock music, ""Revolution"" is strictly electronica like what's heard in most clubs today. It's like he's just copying what's out there instead of creating something new. It reminds me of Madonna's ""American Life"". Plus all the songs are about the same two things, self reflection and world harmony. This is good for a song or two, but you want to throw your arms up and yell enough already. A very disappointing effort from an artist with great potential. If you want a good recent Howard Jones album, get ""Human"" instead."
5,All I can say is WOW,"This CD just proves what an amazing, inventive & creative musician HJ is. There's not one song to dislike and I find them all interesting & pleasing to listen to. This is just one great CD full of soulful, upbeat and quirky pop music that really satisfies. 10 stars if I could!"
2,not too helpful,"I play tennis and was hoping this book would help me to teach my son. Much of the information is very basic and would be useful only to a non-tennis playing parent. If you play tennis and want help in teaching your child, I doubt the book will offer any useful insights. The drills are not particularily helpful because they are geared to groups. This book will be useful only to the true novice parent-teacher"
2,Poor quality,"I purchased three of these units. Two work great, but on one unit, one of the three LEDs failed immediately and about a month later the second LED started flashing continuously (very annoying). I have e-mailed the company for replacement, but from a previous review I understand they make you pay for shipping both ways on a failed unit. I won't buy from a company that makes you pay for their bad product."
1,after 6 months a power outage and it didn't work,I bought 2 of these about 6 months ago - 2 weeks ago I had a power outage - whole neighborhood. Complete blackness. Neither of these came on - they had been working previously (plugged in). I wrote the company - turns out it's one guy. He gave no reason. I just don't think it's a quality product - when they don't work and light the way. I have a baby and she was taking a bath and I had to get her out in the dark and then fumble around for flashlights. I will be another brand next time.
4,safety light,"After only a week we like this light. It can be used as a night light, OR as a motion detecting light. It ramps up and down when the light levels change in the room."
5,lifesaver!,"There was one of these in the back of the closet when we bought our first home last year and we plugged it in on our stairwell. It was nice to have a light that came on automatically, but we really didn't think about it too much. Until hurricane Sandy. We live in NJ and lost power early on Monday. This light, set to nightlight auto kept going until our power was restored 4 days later. Sure, it's not like you are going to read a book by this light. But when your entire neighborhood is pitch back and you have limited batteries it makes all the difference in the world. We will be investing in more of these."
1,"great idea, bad product","it works great for about 3 days.now, the motion detector doesn't work.everything else works fine.return to Amazon for replacement.will be back for an update with the new unit."
1,Do not rely on these lights during a blackout,I have three of these and every single time I've had a black out which is often during our heat waves they have worked. This last power outage I had a week ago each and every single one of them did not come on. They are all set to FLASHLIGHT auto and the NIGHTLIGHT is off so there's no user error here. The motion sensor started working on it's own with the flashlight AUTO on. Strange... Maybe a new manufacturer is why the fail? The green charge light is always on so it is juiced up. Totally bummed out.
4,Very nice product,"After hearing about a friend falling down their stairs after tripping in the middle of the night, I decided we needed to have some strategically placed nights in our house. The Datexx night light is very nice. It gives a pleasant soft glow at night and if there is motion in the room, an additional light comes on softly. This helps light the floor for additional safety. We haven't had a power outage yet, but I know the children will be less concerned if not plunged into total darkness."
2,Good in concept but not great reliability,"I really like the product. The design how you can configure it either as a night light or motion detection light or both is great. Also, the fact that it turns on automatically when it detects loss of power and that it can be used as an emergency flashlight is great. However, I have had approximately 3 out of 6 units fail. While I've had most of them for years, it's still disappointing that the units cannot last longer. Therefore, if the price is cheap enough that they can be considered throw-away, then perhaps they are worth it... but as an investment, it's disappointing."
2,Decent,Okay as a rechargeable flash light (if you don't need too much light.) But as a motion activated light it leaves a lot to be desired.
1,Great...for a year,"I absolutely loved this light for a year. Had it in the bathroom, set for ""Auto Flashlight"" and it provided plenty of light for late night bathroom visits. Then one of the 3 LED bulbs started flickering and one stopped working entirely. Since LED bulbs are not replaceable, it is totally useless now. I tried to remove the screws to see if for some reason the bulbs got loose, but I didn't have a screwdriver in my house that would fit, which is a first. I finally just busted the clear plastic top off and pressed on the bulbs, with no luck. I am going to lay off buying anything with LED bulbs that cannot be replaced. Too much garbage in the world as it is. Those little 7 watt nightlight incandescent bulbs last a pretty long time and don't use much energy. Less wasteful in the long run. (I recently received another Sentina as a gift. We'll see if it lasts longer than the other one.)"
1,concept is good - unreliable - uses 3 AAA batteries,The flash light stopped working after 3 months. The LED brinked when it is pulled from the AC outlet and did not stay lit with all 3 LED.The second unit had the same problem after 14 months.You are better off by buying some LED flash lights and a set of batteries.
5,Excellent purchase,"We've had these for over 2 yrs without a problem. They are great for when the kids have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, or when guests are over and need to do the same. When the power goes out, they come on automatically and help us find our way to the flashlights."
1,Utterly unhelpful!,"I have been studying autogenic training for years using German resources and got this book for my husband. Upon looking through this book, I was utterly disappointed. It contains a lot of psycho babel but no instructions and on top of it, it is badly written. If you want to learn AT this book is not going to teach you how, you will need a therapists, in which case you don't need the book. Not only is it unhelpful, it also does not describe the original autogenic therapy as developed by Schultz, but some personal variation by the authors. I have read a lot of books on AT in German and studied with a trained professional and quite a bit of the stuff in this book would be considered counter productive by all I know. Unfortunately I'm unable to suggest any other book in English to learn AT (but don't buy this book because of a lack of alternatives), which is a great technique for relaxation."
5,There's nothing else like it,"I use this to simulate blood on models. A great technique is to construct ""drool"" or rivulets with model cement, and cover that once it dries. If you put this stuff on too thick, it crinkles up like a raisin."
5,Nice cup,"Bought a cup from another company ""kichen Kaboodle"" and the the cup leaked in the seam !contacted the company and they don't want to hear a thing. This cup from Tumbleweed Pottery is great. They are somewhat expensive, but getting the saying on the side of the mug is great ! worth the extra $ . Get lots of compliments on it."
4,Nice Deep Fryer,I am very satisfied with my fryer purchase. It does/works great for my fish frying and so on. A very good product. I would endorse this product.
4,Does a great job,"I purchased this item because frying fish inside the house leaves an odor that doesn't easily go away. I've used this now a couple of times and am satisfied with the product. I have a propane burner that I put it on, turned up the heat, and it quickly came to fying temperature. I put in 4-5 whole crappie and they fried quickly and beautifully. I'm happy I finally bought one of these and look forward to many frying days ahead. The basket worked fine.It would have been nice to have had a lid."
3,Bayou product,I returned the pot because it had a few dents. Due to the fact that the pot was so thin which cannot handle the shock during shipment
3,Not what I expected,"The first time I ordered this pot it was received badly damaged - it had a huge dent in one side and was completely unusable. However, Amazon customer service was great once I was able to get in contact with someone. I tried fist reaching them by telephone but they were unable to help me due to computer issues on their end, and they never called me back as promised. I eventually was able to chat with a representative online and they immediately sent a new pot out to me for next day delivery and has UPS come by to pick up the damaged one.I thought this was a pot I could use on the stove top for frying, but it was much bigger around than the burners on my stove. It took forever to heat up and was not able to maintain a high temperature.I replaced this with a Hamilton Beach large capacity deep fryer which has been excellent! Love, love, love it! Wish I had bought it to start with instead of this pot. Deep Fryer"
1,What games???,"I have been creating interactive media including e-learning for over 12 years, been a Professor of interactive media and e-learning design for over 8 years, and am currently seeking a PhD in E-Learning. This book is not worth the money. The information in it is only representational of the typical online instruction with message board usage. There are no interactive gaming examples or information for creating e-learning games. The title is extremely misleading.The same information at a cheaper price with an easier read and better examples can be found in ""Engaging the Online Learner: Activities and Resources for Creative Instruction"" by Conrad and Donaldson."
5,Excellent Resource for Online Teachers,"I am an online instructor at the undergraduate level and I have found this book to be very helpful. The activities within are creative, easy to use, and generally work out well in my classes."
2,An OK Book,This book was very dissapointing for me. It was awful and I did not enjoy reading. Instead my class was forced to read it together. The only reason why I did give it 2 stars was because I liked the part in the end about how they don't know what an american is or what a president is when they meet abraham lincoln up in heaven!
1,Didn't finish it,"This book was part of my daughter's history curriculum, and I thought I'd read the first chapter to her before she finished the story herself. We never got very far into the book.I realize many people find this fanciful, far-fetched view of ""heaven"" to be okay, since it is a fictional rendition of an historical character. But, if you are a protestant Christian, it would seem to be too hard to get past the notion of purgatory, going through hell because you aren't quite ready for heaven yet. Either the blood of Christ paid for our sins, or it didn't. The notion of people arguing on the clouds, their fingers drumming interrupting TV reception was just ridiculous. My daughter was as offended with the premise as I was. It took far too long to get to the meat of the story, which should be the life of this fascinating, real woman.I guess we'll have to find other resources to study the life of Eleanor of Aquitaine."
1,OKAY BOOK,"If you are into history, it is a great book, but if you are more into fiction, and mystery, this isn't the book for you. Even though it had some funny parts, it was a bit confusing, and a little bit boring. That's just me."
2,The book was boring.,"The book moved to slowly. There were too many people telling the story of Eleanor's life. I couldn't figure out who ""I"" was half the time in the story. The book is, to me, a good book to learn about the Middle ages, but it's not a real action packed book."
5,A perfect introduction to some great figures in history,"I read this as a student in the seventh or eighth grade more than a decade ago, so I don't have a detailed enough memory of the book to comment on the quality of the writing. But I do remember that this book introduced me to characters such as Henry II, Eleanor of Acquitaine, and all their sons, and I found it all very interesting. Later in life these people would be brought back to my attention by James Goldman's play ""The Lion In Winter"" and it was largely my memories of this book that made this play one of my favorites I've ever read. This book is a great way to introduce any young person to some of the most interesting figures in Medeival history."
4,Great short biographical story of Eleanor and Henry II,"The story of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II is complex and fascinating. This book does an excellent job of hitting all the high points in a compact way. The device that the author uses, that of the main characters waiting around in heaven to see if Henry II will be admitted, is a little strange, but hardly detracts from the overall excellence of the story. I am a teacher and my students will definitely be reading this book next year! Well-written fiction is a great way to delve into history."
3,A real mixed batch,"I thought that this book was interesting, but it is not really a story. It is better than the history books but still not as good as it could of been. Certain parts were a bit lenghty. But I still thought that it is hard to beleive that this is a real person you are reading about. I enjoyed this book more than I would have expected form a historical book. Beware, certain parts are rather boring."
4,Enticing!,This book was required by my 5th grade daughter's English teacher for her reading comprehension class. She is learning a lot about history and Christianity out of this book. Story is very enticing and keeps my daughter's interest in development.
5,This is the sort of book that will make child love history,"This book is another unique book from a very talented author. The story is about one of history's great females, Elinor, who becomes both the queen of France and of England. The story is told through the eyes of those who both love and hate her. Very imaginative book, will certainly keep children entertained."
3,Lots of data...,"I am a fan of Dr. Stephen Turnbull, have many of his books, and love Japanese history and also enjoy their military history. So getting this DVD was a given. With that said, I have to warn you, this is a 44 minute DVD that should have been at least 120 minutes. They rush through Samurai culture, history and tradition at a neck break speed and they do so while being very detailed. In order to keep up you have to know a lot of Japanese history and military history to begin with. People who know nothing about the Samurai or Japanese history should start someplace else.In other words, if you know the history you don't really need the DVD. And if you don't know the history the DVD will very likely overwhelm you with names, dates, places and so on."
1,Bad Vendor Warning,I've written three times to vendor (Indie Film Circuit) since receiving my shipping notice and never received a reply much less the product or a refund.
4,Excellent,"On watching this documentry, i found it very informative and learned alot about Japanes culture. If you are interested in the life of the samuria this is a very good dvd to buy."
1,"Awful, just awful","I had high hopes for this video that lasted about 30 seconds until the video actually started. Most fitness videos have fitness instructors leading them... the women who lead the videos in the Envy series are obviously in great shape, but they were clearly picked for their looks than their ability to teach, lead, or even count. The entire video is more about appearances (a very lame introduction about their ""superpowers"" and the women are all dripping in jewelry wearing ridiculous outfits) than actually teaching anything. Instruction was minimal at best, and the models seemed more concerned about their belly chains (yes, seriously - who works out in a belly chain?) than in even counting (which she messed up more than once, and most of the time it was nonexistent). If you're looking for a good workout video, look elsewhere..."
2,Seems dangerous and Annoying,"There is allot of weight swinging in this video which seems dangerous to me. Additionally, the instructor is annoying with a babygirl voice. This video is more for men to watch than it is for promoting fitness"
1,disappointed,"The bible being what it is, is really difficult to put in kindle version i didnt like that i couldnt just flip the pages to were i wanted to go.. it was a bit difficult. I went out and bought the womens devotional bible in hard back, which is alot easier to read :)"
5,Excellent Bible,I read the NIV Women's bible devotional from Bible Gateway and I always see this bible on the side of the page. So I decided to order it and I'm glad I did. I even ordered an extra one for a friend. I'm very pleased with this bible.
3,Women's Devotional Bible NIV,"My first E-Bible. I love the fact I can carry it anywhere and use it at anytime. However a few things I'd like to see improved.The text where Jesus is speaking is not in red.Highlighting is okay but if the verse goes to another page, I have to start the highlight over - that could be operator error.Highlighted text is listed as a location rather than listing the Book or the verse number or both.I probably would not recommend paying almost $15.00 for it but live and learn."
4,The begining,"This is the DVD where it all started for ben ten. It works fine, Just wish that discs were all non-scratchable."
5,For a kid that loves this.,I can't complain much; this is the first season of the cartoon. Nothing much I can comment about the product.
5,Ben is still a 10,Both of my kids love it. We have watched this one over and over. Some of the commentaries are really interesting. We just wish we could see the person who does the voice of Ben.
5,Ben 10 - The Complete Season 1,"All the first season episodes, great commentary and previews of the up-coming season. Bought as a birthday gift for my son, he and my daughter (who loves Gwen)watch it repeatedly. I am hooked too - it appeals to all ages and both genders. One of the best new superheros in a long time."
3,Ben 10,"I purchased this for my 6 year old son. There is a story and kids will be drawn to it, but I would caution parents of the ""gun"" content. A bit much for my liking considering that it's science fiction. Something more creative could of been imagined to fight off the various foes."
5,Ben 10,This product got here on time with no hassles and worked and came with everything it said it would thank you
5,Ben 10 - The Complete Season 1,"The little boy I bought this for is enjoying countless hours of entainment. He plays his DVD in the car, at home and even shares it with his fellow classmates."
5,BEN 10 IS GREAT,"My 8 yr old son loves anything Ben 10. He has Season 1 & 2, the PS2 game and just about every 6"" action figure."
1,Worst Book I've Ever Read On The Topic,"I have never written a comment about a book, but hopefully other people will at least be warned. This is the one of the worst books I've ever read. I have read several Wiley books; most of them are poorly written and lacking substance. This one is unbelievably bad.This book deserves a negative five stars. (Who wrote those other reviews?)If you have never read a book on trading systems, then this book is may tell you something. Otherwise, save your money. There's nothing here."
5,Very good book.,I just finished reading this book. I bought Pardo's older book because it was shorter by a couple hundred pages and a bit cheaper. It was very well worth the read. Great and important informaiton. It will make me a better trader. Highly recommended.
3,"performance nice, some sound problems","I will defer to the previous reviewer on the performance - it is nice indeed! But the audio mix of sections is sometimes not too good. I don't want to over-do it - The overall sound sound is very good, and supports this powerful performance well. However, the woodwinds can barely be heard in many of their prominent solo parts, (especially in the 9th) and they are overpowered by background lines in other sections. It's too bad, because I really like this kind of (dare I say it?)Furtwanglerish performance. If you want to hear a really good blend, albeit a somewhat more conservative (but outstanding) performance...Boem/Vienna has the sound really right.Schubert: Symphony No. 9 in C Major, D 944/Mass No. 6 in E Flat Major, D950 [Region 2]"
2,teflon isn't useful for real application,"The teflon coating allows the paint to be peeled up only if the paint is thick enough, as shown in the illustration on the packaging. Because paint trays are designed for rolling out paint into a thin layer and for using up as much as possible of what is poured into the trough, the teflon feature is useless for real-world application. I found I had to scrape the paint out of the bottom with a thumbnail, which over time will mar the teflon finish, which will eventually lead to the tray being even more useless. The claim of ""no need for a tray liner"" is true only if you want to waste time meticulously peeling--probably easier to wash the tray, as you would do with a cheaper, standard non-teflon tray."
4,Rich warn jazz tinged baritone...,"You can certianly hear the influences of Billy Eckstine, Johnny Hartman, and Dick Haymes in the rich warm jazz tinged bariton of the extremely talented Earl Coleman. This CD is a must buy, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to all jazz vocal fans and snobs alike."
3,"not the worst, but still........",this sasha head is SICK. i think it gets 2 1/2 stars! oh yeah shutUP bratz rock..................=p
3,Uummm...,"Uuummm... I think I'm guna HURL. Dis is da ugliest head i have eva seen! She has white hair??!! Wot's all dat about?? Normally i really like sasha dolls but dis is just BLERGH! She looks really really freaky. But fair play the hair is good quality! But i don't think styling heads should have fringes... if you want one you can cut it ur self, but then again when i do get the scissors out, i get a bit scissor happy... Bald isn't really a good look for the Bratz!Any who, in conclusion BLERRGH(sick noise)..........SHAME!LUV YA Suzie Moverhoven-Snuff!!! (;-)"
5,Cat toy,Cats love these toys. I put them in a container of cat nip for a few days and then give them to the cats. Excellent.
5,IMO THE best pellet for target shooting,"So far this pellet gives me the best results for target shooting, both air rifle (Remington Summit) and air pistol (Baikal IZH-53M)"
3,They are getting old,"I just bought this album with lots of excitement! Okay, Dennis was gone but that's fine. The new vocalist is not bad at all. Especially they also have Glen so it's definitely a good line-up.The chosen setlist is very good. Some old stuffs, some Glen era, some new ones, some non-Styx material. Everything sounds good.This album contains songs from different location during their tour. Between songs there were some gaps, the audience's noise and applause didn't flew smoothly. And this really bothers me. I couldn't feel the 'live' atmosphere. Some songs were slowed down a bit, and it really turns me down.Well, overall this album is very good. Perhaps it's their age that made some songs less interesting. Some songs were performed less energic."
5,STYX proves it again!!!!!,"Styx has proven that they are the best LIVE performing band around. The CD is awesome. 'Criminal Mind' is an a great ballad that every Styx fan needs to hear. It's great to see songs like 'Snowblind,' 'Rockin' the Paradise,' and 'Boat On The River' on the CD. And to see Tommy's 'High Enough' puts the icing on the cake. There is no 'Renegade' or 'Too Much Time On My Hands' but luckily I got the Arch Allies CD. Way to go Styx, you've done it again!!!!"
1,Not worth the price,This is another rehash of older songs. Nothing new thats worth spending you money on. Not even the original STYX line up. No Dennis DeYoung on this Cd. New people aren't as good.
4,Live- Is the only way,"If you people think about it, the only way you get the real feel for the music is when its live. You can buy an album recorded in the studio, but, big deal. When you go to there concert its live, and if you have ever been to a styx concert, you know their great. So as far as i'm concerned, Live is better. Cant wait till July 7th, Styx is returning to the ""Burgh"" (pittsburgh) , Front row seats, as always."
2,Another live album?,"While there are some interesting songs on Styxworld Live, was another live album really necessary? This is Styx's third live album in the past 4 years and it is getting really old really fast! How many times can you stand JY singing ""Miss America"" or ""Snowblind""? How many times can you hear Tommy sing ""Crystal Ball""?Though there are some interesting acoustic moments (like ""Sing for the Day"" and Damn Yankee's ""High Enough""), this album is not worth the money. Get the ""Return to Paradise"" CD and leave it at that. Both ""Styxworld Live"" and ""Live at Riverport"" are lesser versions of that live album!"
1,Another live album? Give me a break!,"It just goes to show you what Styx is made of. NO ONE should buy this album. If you already have ""Return to Paradise"" or ""Caught in the Act"", don't even waste your money. I will not support Styx anymore because they are not the same band without Dennis DeYoung. I would pay to see Dennis DeYoung perform with just a piano on-stage. Enough said! Styx is gone! Memories live on....."
3,A pretty good disc allright,"It's nice, but in my opinion are 'at rivers edge', and 'Return to paradise' much better. I also think that 'Caught in the act'is much better.But it isen't a bad cd, I just like those others better, okay?And cyclorama is a very good one too! It really rocks. A pitty that Dennis DeYoung is gone, but Lawrence Gowen is very good too.Well, I think STYX is the best band in the world, don't you?"
2,Do You Really Need Another Live Styx Album? NO!,"Being a devoted Styx fan since 1983 (later I went back and bought and studied all earlier albums), I have recently become very disallusioned with the band. Only two studio albums out since 1991, we, as fans, have been force fed a handful of ""greates hits"" repeats and tuned up ""live"" albums -- none of which has satisfied my appetite for a good Styx album. So, was I suprised to hear that the ""new"" Styx album was ANOTHER live recording? No -- but I wasn't too upset, because I did have some inkling to hear Larry Gowan's ""Criminal Mind"" tune live, along with Glen Burtnik's song. However, these two gems are packed inbetween the same old Styx live fare (Rockin' the Paradise, Miss America, Come Sail Away) and the final tally isn't refreshing at all. If you own ""Caught in the Act"" or ""Return to Paradise"", don't bother buying this album. I'm sure it will turn up in the used CD section of your local store by the end of July."
1,Oh Boy howdy...just what we need,"What a slap in the face.Making a LIVE album so we Styx fans can hear Lawrence Gowan singing classic songs like Rockin the Paradise and Come Sail Away.Sacrilege to butcher Dennis's beautiful songs like this.Lawrence Gowan can't sing Styx. Maybe his own stuff is fine....but Styx? DENNIS's songs? NO WAY.Dennis has the best voice on the planet. STILL...This live CD is a band's desperate attempt to get back at the one who gave Styx its signature sound....for without Dennis, Styx is just some generic-sounding rock band. Blech."
3,Not quite there!,"You can't use classic songs with a different lead singer! If a band gets a new lead vocalist, write new songs - don't ruin the old ones!"
4,"""waiter! waiter! I have a request!""","hows about ""Man In The Wilderness"" live???and throw in an extended version of ""Lady"" ...while you're at it, throw in some ""Castle Walls""how 'bout it? I promise I won't whine that Dennis isn't singing them!"
3,"A new twist, but lacking in some areas","All in all, a great album. It starts off kicking the listener in the pants with ""Rockin the Paradise."" The new lead vocals blow Dennis DeYoung's version out of the water. Other than that, this album takes some weird twists. ""Sometimes Love Ain't Enough"" is beautifully sung, but I just don't feel it belongs on the album. It's not Styx. It was written by a guy who currently is in Styx, but it doesn't fit. Vocals are amazing, some of the highest notes I've heard in a long time from age-pushing guys. Dennis DeYoung and his classics (and voice) are duly missed, but the band is obviously surviving (and thriving) without him. Tommy Shaw hasn't lost a step, in fact, he seems to have done the opposite of most rock singers. His voice sounds better than it did when he was younger. The high stuff is coming easier, and sounds less thrown. All in all, a good powerhouse album to own"
4,Installation in a wall with an existing cat door,"I had already installed a simple Cat Mate door in my wall and it worked fine except, as others have said, the raccoons and skunks got in. I did not want to enlarge the holes in the wall so I mounted the new electromagnetic Cat Mate flush on the inside wall so that only the ""outside"" lip was in the tunnel. I left the existing Cat Mate door on the outside wall. The unit looks great even though it projects a little into the room and the setup works great. The cats easily adjusted to coming in through two doors instead of one and I did not have to make any alterations to the wall."
1,easy entry for raccoons,"Even fully locked, raccoons come inside! Waste of my time and money- I'm returning it.I will try the door suggested by the previous commenter."
1,Maybe we just have a really smart stray cat...,"We got this cat door so the stray we feed could come into the basement when it's cold, but not up the basement stairs to fight our cats, who are indoor/outdoor. However, he learned to hook his claws under the door and then pull it out, which doesn't require a magnet.Maybe he's just really smart, but it took him less then 24 hours to figure out. My cats still haven't figured out how to time the magnet/door lock to get in. And it took us 3 weeks to figure out how he was getting in."
3,works while it lasts,"My first two copies of this cat door worked fine until the flat spot where the door contacts the electromagnetic latch broke under repeated battering by a neighbor cat.I'd try another brand if this one didn't work so well. My cat has no problems going through it, and the battery lasts for many months. Another brand would probably not fit the opening I cut in the garage door for this one. So although it's annoying, I'll suck it up and buy another, but before I install it, I'll reinforce the door to prevent that breakage."
1,I found this useless,"Reading the other reviews i'm thinking i maybe got a bad apple. The lock on our door would only open for a split second if you held the magnet exactly one inch away and straight in front of it. So if your cat moonlights as a circus acrobat this may be for you, otherwise i would stay away from this one."
2,"Eeeeh - it's ""o.k.""","Like many American products these days, it's designed poorly to keep the cost down -Plasticky!. It keeps other cats out of the screen porch, but the Raccoon still gets in. If you can get your nail, claw or whatever under the door, it can still be opened.Another stupid thing in RE: this item- Amazon's stock # is wrong with other vendors (if it ships from Petsmart, or StateLine Tack) and you will get the SMALL cat door as opposed to the ""Pet Door"" and if you have a fat cat, you'll be sending it back."
1,keyed entry from only one side?,"Description was misleading. Unkeyed access to the outside. Keyed access to the inside. We bought this to keep one cat in, while allowing another cat to roam freely. This cat door is going back."
2,difficult for cat to get door open,"my cat has to hit her head against the plastic shield multiple times before she can get it to open.I don't think her neck is any longer than most, however, it does not open unless she is smashedinto the plastic. Maybe if they had earrings, it would be better???"
2,Get the microchip door instead.,"Finally replaced this door with the microchip door. SOOO much better than this one. Got tired of replacing the collar magnets needed for this one as my cat had a hideout under my neighbor's metal storage building, where I am sure a half dozen collars/magnets remain. Pay the extra and get the microchip one."
2,Lacks one important function,"This door doesn't have a mechanism to just keep the plastic locking tab down, so that the door can freely swing both ways. There are many times when one doesn't need the door to lock one way or the other, or indeed, completely locked. If you have a cat that just can't take to going in or out via the Cat Flap, and you've already installed it, then you have to take the front cover off and manufacture a retainer to keep the tab down. Would it be that hard for Cat Mate to install one more position on the thing, so that the door can go both ways freely?"
5,Works well for my feeder box,"I installed this door in a large, clear, storage box to serve as an isolated feeding location for my cat with special dietary needs. It took a little training, but this door has worked very well. Occassionally, the magnet/collar position can cause the door to relock before my cat gets in, but it has never stopped her from trying again. An RFID version would likely be more foolproof, but is much costlier."
2,"touchy, hard to open",Unless the angle is just right the magnet won't open the door. Leads to lots of head bobbing and the lock chattering like crazy.
3,"Does not require ""key"" going IN & OUT","I just returned the one I purchased 3 weeks ago. The door works fine except if you have racoons, skunk or other intelligent creatures that want your pets food. The problem is your pet only needs a key to come IN but not go out--OUT is completely open. Racoons are smart enough to pull open the door from the outside since it is only locked swinging in. Alternatively, you could bend down and lock the door every night once your cat is inside but that defeats one of the main reasons for buying these doors. Therefore pay attention to what the mfg. says. This one said:""4 settings: 2-way, entry only, exit only and locked ""Their concept of 2-way is key required to come in but no key required going out. I want one that requires a key in both directions so the other animals can't get in at all."
1,Don't buy this door,"Don't buy this door. It has serious design flaws. We bought ours less than 2 months ago and went to all the trouble to install it and now we have to rip it out and buy a new one -- a different brand this time. One of the many problems with this brand is that the flap sticks partly open - doesn't always close all the way. So when my cat comes back into the house, the flap stays partly open which allows all the neighbor cats to freely enter our house. I tried applying WD-40 to the hinges, I tried trimming the weather-proofing strip, I've tried everything. It's just poorly designed. Both the hinge and the flap are plastic and the flap is lightweight, so the friction is just keeping the flap open. I never ever review products, but this thing has gotten me so mad that I decided to submit this review in the hopes that someone else can avoid my frustration."
3,not as good as they were 10 years ago!,"This door did not crack or fall apart like the staywell cat door, but it did not keep my cats in when in the lock mode. It does a great job of keeping strays out and they were unable to crack it open."
2,Painfully Boring!,"I must agree with the reviews of Perri Litton, Kevin Lee, and P. Wilson. This book is extremely boring. I'm halfway through the book. It's painful to try to finish. I paid money for this book. That is the only reason I haven't put the book back on the book shelf. This book is 232 pages. I can normally read such a short book in one day but I've been struggling for 8 days to finish.I've read 3 of James Earl Hardy's previous novels; ""B-Boy Blues"", ""2nd Time Around"" and ""If Only For One Nite"". ""A House Is Not A Home"" is by far the worst.I was hoping that it would get better as I go along. I lost hope when I read the reviews. If you MUST read this book, check it out from the library."
2,A Jood Mess,"I'm sorry, but did I read the same book as the other reviewers? I purchased this book just knowing it was going to be off da chain just based on the reviews from this site. Damn I was wrong. I own every book in the B-boy Blues series and I must say that this maybe the worst of them all. What about going out with a bang? I gave this book 2 stars just because he caught us up pretty well with everyone. I consider the rest a jood mess."
2,What was I thinking,"I am glad that a friend brought the book and gave it to me a gift (which I regifted). For one I wish the author would learn to keep a consistent writing style or learn how to keep his in a range. I cannot compare this book to ealier writings. I can be truthful and say this B-Boys blues was the best and Love the one your with was good, Everything else was horrible. James Earl Hardy was very sloppy with the other three books not mention (for your own sake), I actually started reading this book in a book store and realized it was not good enough to buy. Thank goodness for amazon's discounts because you would be wasting some serious money on this."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"The ""B"" in B-Boy Blues must stand for BORING. I gave it 1 star because zero stars are not permitted."
4,Great!,In the description i doesn't say that it comes w. the little steal pick but it does. we made them for the first time and it tasted great!
4,A little taste of Osaka,"We were surprised to see this available through Amazon. The recipes that came with the pan were representative of the takoyaki my son became accustomed to during a stay in Kyoto.This particular model is somewhat difficult to stabilize on the burner, but the results were worth the trouble. The price was very good compared to other websites where similar items are available"
2,The pan sticks,"The surface of the pan isn't smooth enough, so without using a lot of oil, the batter sticks to the pan and it's very hard to rotate the takoyaki balls. If you think of this as a hard-core training takoyaki pan, you will acquire a professional level skill when you learn to make descent takoyakis with this pan. If you can make takoyakis with this pan, you can make excellent takoyakis with any other pans."
1,Not for Aebleskiver,"This should not have been grouped with aebleskiver. The slots are not big enough. I wanted to return it, but too heavy and costly."
1,"extremely disappointed, DO NOT BUY!","OK. im one of those people who reads reviews online before buying anything.all the 6 reviews of this product on amazons (sold by house of rice) are positive to say the least. so i went ahead and purchase it.the worst part of the design is that the indents are placed WAY too close together, making it impossible to separate the takoyaki balls nicely from one another. im amazed at how not a single review points this out!and no matter how much oil i add to this pan. it sticks like glue.i'm completely dissatisfied with this product.im now eating the tako as sashimi!!!!"
2,"Better than ""Airwar Over Germany""","Once again ""Arnhem"" is not of the quality of the original BATTLEFIELD series (BATTLEFIELDS?). Still, I found ""Arnhem"" to be relatively OK. There was an overemphasis on commander biographies which really tried my patience and there was much repetitive information re. the campaign which made its presentation boring. There were many repetitive film clips and clips of the German 1944 Ardennes Offensive which, of course, had nothing to do with Arnhem. For an historical doc this sort of defeats the purpose of watching. Overall, I didn't mind seeing this doc once--but once is enough. The detailed and coherent chronology of the original BATTLEFIELD series is sadly lacking here."
1,lame war film,Some decent footage but it is a rip off compilage of brief scenes shown over and over. Amazingly repetitive and so very poor a protrayal of a fascinating campaign. Not entirely accurate either which compounds and adds insult to injury. STay away from this DVD!
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the Italian language version of this film, but Amazon sent me the English version instead. It is in a different box than pictured and not the same identification number. Unfortunately, it sat on a shelf for several months before I viewed it and discovered the switch. Buyers, beware!"
1,A Special Day,So not worth it. A very poor quality. Not to mention its dubbed over in English. Looks like it was copied from VHS.
1,A Special Day,"A Special Day is a masterful film by Ettore Scola. This version, dubbed into English, although clearly advertised as ""in Italian"", is a horrible copy. Do not purchase this copy!. I have notified Amazon that it is dubbed in English, and that they should either correct the information as given, or withdraw this copy from circulation, lest more unwitting buyers suffer as I have. Hopefully, in returning it,I will be immediately reimbursed.A Special Day"
1,Amazon - please act on information from reviews,"I was considering buying this because the image showed the original cover and the descriptor indicated that it is subtitled - both facts leading me to believe that I'd be purchasing the original, not the dubbed version. I'm glad I read the reviews which advised otherwise. What's of greater concern, however, is that the first review pointing out this problem was written in 2005, and the most recent in 2011. So, 6 years of feedback to Amazon about this inaccurate information and still no change. Thanks to those of you who set me straight."
1,Terrible DVD,"This may be a great movie, but you won't find out from watching this low quality dubbed version. It looks like a copy of a copy of a copy."
4,ECSTASY,"After playibg this C.D. I was in ecstasy. What a pity there isn't more of Lucille's work available. Excellent album. Well selected material, ideally suited to Lucille's strong and vibrant voice. My favourite track ..... Mississippi."
3,The French Song,"This is a very nice, fairly recently recorded collection of Lucille Starr songs. Her voice has matured somewhat, so if you are expecting the ""chirpy"" quality of her recordings from the 60's, you will find this offering lacking in that area."
2,Not inspired to try others in the series,"I saw the Magic Tree House series on a suggested reading list for young children, and it had good reviews. A friend of mine also suggested it. Maybe it's aimed more towards early readers than towards younger children. My daughter is 5 and seemed to like it well enough while I was reading it to her.However, it did not seem like a very good book to me. There isn't much of a plot; we were halfway through before the tsunami was even mentioned, and I was beginning to wonder if anything was going to happen at all. Not much did. Coming straight off ""Charlotte's Web"" by E. B. White, I was highly disappointed and don't think I will be reading another one anytime soon."
3,"Great addition, but not one of her best","Our 4 y.o. loves this series (we also have the audio) he can listen to them for hours. When a child would rather listen to books than watch tv, it's a winner! To the educator from Hawaii, GET OVER IT. It's a series about Jack and Annie, they go around helping/saving everyone. Jack saving 2 Hawaiian kids and his little sister from a devastating tsunami, you found that offensive? Now if you want to criticize the book how about the lack of research, there is no B in the Hawaiian alphabet. Kama would have never been allowed to climb a coconut tree, in ancient times women did not gather or prepare food until after menstruation ceased. Boka would not have been making kapa (aka tapa) that was women's work. Lastly, poi is NEVER made with fruit juice! But what she did get right makes up for the mistakes, she captured the Aloha Spirit. Reading this story with my son makes me miss home!"
1,Not at all good,"Despite the author's claim to have been reading about Hawaii before writing this book, the place she describes in the story is hardly Hawaiian. In fact, it's as if the author has never seen a real coconut, been to Hawaii, or frankly, flipped through a travel brochure. There should be some truth in a story like this, otherwise, reading the book is just an exercise. You, yes, you, could have written this book in 3 hours.I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the stereotypes used to describe the Hawaiians. Happy, dancing, friendly, open faces...It was silly and lazy on the author's part. And how many ancient Hawaiians were named Boka? The letter B was not used for Hawaiian words."
5,Read in an Hour,My 7-year-old read this in a matter of a couple hours. He loved it. He loved all the Magic Treehouse books. He even read a few of them two or three times. Excellent book. Wish they were a little longer so he couldn't zip through them so fast. :D
4,Buy this book,"My children have several books in this series (Magic Tree House). I bought this one for my 9 year old. This one is about going back in time and learning about friendship. It's a nice story.The only part I didn't like was the peer pressure for one character to surf (a child who was afraid to surf) with no lessons or safety info. At least they did show some danger in doing so later on in the story. (I don't think you should stop kids from learning new sports but there should be parental supervision, ""how to"" lessons and safety instructions.)Overall, I feel this is a great book."
2,Misleading and poorly written,"This book's romantic title is completely misleading, as the Anglo-Persian war can hardly be described as being fought ""for a lady"". The other problem with this book is that it is very poorly written. It desperately needed a proofreader, not to mention an editor. However, it deals with a rather obscure conflict and seems to cover the military portion of it fairly well. So, if you desire to learn about the Anglo-Persian war, this book will at least tell you which armies went where and how the various battles turned out."
4,Readers Beware,"Upon purchasing this particular book i found out to my surprise that it was written in the French text. Unless you are able to read, translate and understand the French language I recommend you make sure you get the English version (or which ever language you understand the best) if you want to read this story. Thank you for your time."
4,Small plates for cutting down the calories,"I bought these plates because I've had success with Corelle in the past and I wanted a small plate. I've read some theories about how smaller plate makes it look like you have more food and thus you don't eat as much. I like the design, they have been break resistant and you can use them in the microwave, a trifecta."
1,"Love the dishes, but...not a bargain","We love these Corelle plates, but having to buy them individually really sucks. Corelle should package them in boxes of four for a more reasonable price than four of these individual plates."
2,second hand info...,I read this book with open eyes! All the information was second hand or a friend of a friend of a friend... I was disapointed in the writing.
5,Awesome....,"I read this big book twice and Im amazed at the information given on subjects, OTHER than UFO stuff. Everyone always talked about Billy and UFO's and this book has a fair share of it, but what it really does is give you an in depth look at where humans came from, how the solar system has changed over millions of years, religion and its brainwashing, spirituality as I've never heard before and many more topics... In the book he even gives future predictions of what will happen if we don't wake up as humans and talks about predictions that he predicted many years ago that already came true... This is a truly amazing piece of information.."
2,This is not the complete movie,"First off, I love this movie. Were it complete, I'd give it 5 stars. I've waited for it to come out in widesceen, and it's an excellent copy. George Kennedy shines in this film, but Martin Balsam steals the show. However, in the first scene, one of Douglas V. Fowley's lines is cut, and then Bob Steele appears immediately afterward as an engineer in the scene where the prostitutes are being loaded on the train, and his part's cut from the film!Head `Em Off At the Pass!: 94 Westerns You Should Watch"
2,Celebrate Flagg Day!,"A watch, a pension, a round of applause, and the good Marshal is ushered to early retirement. You'd have a blank look on your face too. But maybe not as blank as the goon who replaces you. Very enjoyable to see where this movie wants to go. But best of all is the scenery! And the smell of hot tobacco spit in the fire of life..."
1,Iphone 3gs,Does not fully fit the iphone 3gs. It does cover not the edges of the screen. Had to buy another protector.
3,NOT MADE FOR IPHONE 3G nor 3GS,if you are looking for an iphone 3g or 3gs screen protector THIS DOES NOT FIT well! it leaves spaces on the sides and it has weird square at the top..edit: changed to 3 stars instead of 1.
1,A Comic Book?,"After reading about a new urban legend online (kids killed by rattle snakes and/or hypodermic needles in ball pits at fast food restaurants) I was linked to ""The Big Book of Urban Legends."" I had seen the movie ""Urban Legend"" and remembered one of the characters reading a similar book in the movie. So I ran out and bought it. SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE POSTED IN CAPITAL BOLD FACED LETTERS THAT THIS IS A COMIC BOOK! This is not a book to be read. It's a book to be browsed by people who don't have time to read. If you heard all the stories before (you probably have) you won't learn anything new here. I was expecting the stories and their origins. Very disappointing!"
5,I heard it from a friend-of-a-friend of mine,"BOOK REVIEW:This book combines two of the things I really like--Urban Legends and Comic Books. This book features urban legends with illustrations in comic book format!A lot of my favorite urban legends are in this movie like stories about the baby sitter (""The call is coming from inside the house!""), the exploding cactus, the microwaved poodle, the killer in the back seat, the hook, etc.Even though this is practically a comic book, I wouldn't recommend letting minors read it, because there might be some things presented in the book that might scare them."
2,"A comic book, with illustrations of well-known urban myths","This book is a compilation of black-and-white, comic book illustrations of popular urban myths. If you are into that sort of art, then the book is worthwhile, but it is not for those who are seeking any analysis or in-depth information about urban legends."
4,It's a COMIC BOOK!,"I guess I should start out by saying that this book is a COMIC BOOK and not something meant to be read. I was a little disappointed when I received it in the mail. If you're looking for a great book full of stories of urban legends, this book is not for you."
3,"Losing our touch a bit, are we?","While the ""Big book of..."" series contains some seriously good installments this here is sadly not one of them.Strange, because the topic (urban legends) should have actually provided more inspipration than the offerings in the book. What's missing is the commentary. Urban legends you do get, but you get'm simply presented and even then not in the best comic form the series has accustomed us to. It's as if the contributors were dealing with this book in a ""lets get this assignment out of the way"" type of attitude.Start out instead from the stunning ""The big book of conspiracies"" or the truly great ""Big book of the unexplained"" and you will spot the difference in quality too.This here is only for the passionate collectors of the series allthough i think even they will feel a bit cheated with this one.I know i was.."
3,Surprised,"I was really surprised when i get this book, because i was expecting a book, that showned how they do it, but this one tells each legend in one page. It's not what you want, unless you're searching for a full urban legend index, THEN BUY IT!!!"
2,not a comic book fan,"The stories are interesting, but I bought the book intending to be scared and by putting it in comic book form that was taken away from me. That should be mentioned before purchasing that it was written in that form. The stories are also too short. They took a long scary urban legend and shortened it so much it just wasn't fun. So basically, I was very disappointed in the book."
2,I did not know it was like a comic book print.,It would probably be O.K. if I knew it was like a comic book type book. But that is not what I was looking for.
5,wonderfully entertaining,"what a great book -- addictively interesting, funny, and nostalgic. Many of them brought back childhood memories of the story about the guy who.....; others I'd heard told to me as fact; others were new to me. All were interesting -- highly recommended."
1,women's Jacket,"The quality of the fabric is poor. After the first wash, it look old and became too small."
4,Holds thousands of songs.,"This handheld has a ton of space. 20 Gigs. That will hold somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 songs depending on the format you use. This player is a bit outdated with it's larger size and monochrome screen. But it delivers good quality music with long battery life."
4,Works great in my car!,"I bought this unit refurbished at a discountelectronics store in Austin TX for $29. I drive a lot, and bought it to stay in my car, so I appreciate the large capacity and the easy to read screen as well. I loaded 1500 songs and it is only half full. The controls are easy to use on the go as well. I plug it into my stereo's Aux input and it sounds great. On the downside, it is sensitive to cold, due to the hard drive, but only in the winter after being in the car all night. When that happens (under 40 degrees?) I simply place it on my leg for a couple of minutes and it will then warm up sufficiently. Its only happened a few times. I don't much like the bulky charger cord or the need to load drivers and firmware, but for $29, I can deal with it! Not fair to compare with a much newer and MUCH more expensive iPod Touch."
1,Mike who?,"First of all, if anyone is fooled by the notion that Mike Love served any purpose to the Beach Boys other than being the guy who fought Brian Wilson with unparalled jealousy over the direction of Pet Sounds and SMiLE is mistaken. Not to take anything away from his natural gift with his great bass filled R&B voice but his latest shenaningans by suing Brian Wilson over the SMiLE album are just evil. After all that Brian Wilson has been through in his tormented life, Mike Love should be ashamed of himself. Once we put in perspective what kind of person Mike Love really is (from his drunken behavior at the 1988 Hall of Fame induction ceremony of the Beach Boys to his insane jealousy of Brian Wilson and SMiLE)we see how he has turned into a whore of a corrupted and ruined music industry. Do not waste your money on Mike Love and this album. Buy SMiLE instead and show Mike Love who the true leader and genius behind the Beach Boys really is."
5,Supreme Allah,"Trag's delayed album came up trumps. He's the Don Imam of Islam hiphop music. This album should be in all TRUE hip hop fans collections.""THE QB MAYOR"""
3,Best Candy on the Planet!,I simply enjoyed reliving the days again when I was a young girl with this nostalgic candy package. It was simply everything I expected and more! I would recommend it to others and order it again!
2,very little candy,I was expecting to have lots of candy like the picture did...Wow..not even close. Small pieces and not all the candy that was listed was in the box. Very disappointed.
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting a bunch more candy. The ad photo is very deceiving! I wanted something with older candy in it, not the stuff I can buy today. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
1,Nostalgic Penny Candy,The majority of this candy was penny type candy. Very disappointed in the value...although the candy was good Most of the candy can be purchased locally.
1,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in this candy. As mentioned in many of the previous reviews, it was cheap penny candy, much of which can be bought at any store today. I kind of expected that... I mean, they aren't going to produce old candy just for these packages, so they have to still be making them somewhere.What I was really disappointed in was the amount. The total worth of the candy in the box was maybe $5. The box was cute, but very tiny. You would be better to do a little research and put together your own box, with 3-4 times the amount for the same money."
4,Gives real insight into the life of a woman writer,"I was interested in reading about the woman who had stirred up so much emotion with her biography of Joseph Smith. I have discovered, since living in Utah, the Brodie name can cause real division. I was intrigued by the descriptions of growing up in Utah in the first part of the 20th century. The evolution from devout member of the Mormon church to one who questioned and then left the fold, is thoughtful and well researched. Most of all, I was captivated by the description of Fawn Brodies's writing process. It is actually more telling and more informative than many of the volumes devoted to writing. It is a rare glimpse into the balancing act of a woman who had chosen to include writing in her already full life, especially in a time when women were rarely found working. Many of the feelings she shares and the conflicts she expressed ring true today. A fair and even handed look at a very complex woman."
2,An interesting view of a controversial author,"Bringhurst does a semi-adequate job of telling the story of a woman who was raised in the very bowels of the Mormon church, and decided to push against it."
5,Our toddler son loves it!,"We checked this out from our local library for our 2 1/2 year-old rail fan son, and we have renewed it three times. He loves it, we love it. Fabulous photos, extensive and interesting historical discussion of railroading in each region of the country. Not your typical schlocky coffee-table book. Beautiful and well-written."
2,No Straps.,"I ordered the LC -1 A.L.I.C.E. Pack Frame-Mil-Spec advertized as ""Used-Very Good"" for $19.99. It says it comes ""w/ OD Shoulder Straps / Kidney Pad & Belt with Grey Quick Release ARMY Buckle"". All I received was the frame. The frame seems pretty good, it's got a few dings and scratches and one of the strap slots is dented. All things you would expect from a ""Used"" frame, but no Straps or Kidney Pad...kind of something you need, to be able to carry the frame on your back."
4,"Finally, a frame.","This frame came with woodland camo kidney pads and straps instead of the pictured OD ones. It wasn't a problem for me, though. My pack is woodland camo, so it worked out. Also, this is not a GI unit, so there is some slight variation on the junction between shoulder straps attach to the top of the rack. Personally, I like the GI design better, but I have had no problems with this one."
4,Just in time,Wore my infantry outfit in the Memorial Day parade. The rack helped distribute the weight of the pack nicely. I have added a few other items to the uniform since then too. I look INFANTRY!
3,Not what you think.,"From the description, I thought this might be one of those amusing T&A flicks from the 70's. The ones where the girls are jiggling out of their tops in all sorts of preposterous situations. The story is boring, not funny at all. Cassandra Peterson is topless, not naked as the alternative title suggests. It's definatley her, she does the same thing with her eyes that she does when accenting a punchline as the Elvira character. When you've seen this once, your not likely to sit through it again."
3,Working Girls,"This version of Working Girls is a 70s drive-in movie, not to be confused with the other later and much superior ""Working Girls"" w/Jane Fonda, etc. This one features Sarah Kennedy, Goldy Hawn's replacement on TV's old ""Laugh-In"", Simon Sturgis, son of classic film director Preston Sturgis, and Elvira, TV vamp. Directed by Stephanie Rothman, queen of low budget girl flicks, this one involves a comely young woman's adventures looking to make some honest bucks in LA.I ordered a copy mainly because I was the assistant director on this film, but never got to see the finished product. I remember the cast & crew as nice folks, especially Elvira, but thefilm is nothing special. Also not the best print for this DVD issue."
5,First hand account of early Alaska,"I bought this in the hopes of having a good first hand account of Tyonek, but I see that there is a lot of potential for more accounts of other areas visited. This is a long term investment in understanding this period of Alaskan history, much as the accounts of the Kilbucks and other Moravian missionaries, Hannah Breece and other schoolteachers, whalers like Charles Brower, and others whose adventures brief and long document the American period colonization of Alaska."
4,Intelligent - Erie,"This is a thought provoking, honest look into the mind of Kevin Max. Much of these writings are excerpts from his spiritual journey, which, believe it or not does include realtionships, bouts with vanity, struggles with fame, and refreshing insight. Kevin is, foremost, a talented poet who should not stop with one book. ""Honest"" is the word that best describes his work. Coupled with the paintings of my favorite painter- Jimmy Abegg- and the design of Buddy Jackson -makes this one of the best poetry books I own. The only thing that could use some help is the binding of the pages themselves - poorly done."
2,Disappointed.,"I can't figure out how the title of the book applies to the story. The central character is a thoroughly unlikeable man, self-centered and unsympathetic. There is an overwhelming amount of description of the weather conditions, all greys and browns and brownish yellows. Very depressing. I found many spelling errors and some words and items which I had no idea what they were and unusually (for me) had no interest in finding out what they meant. I kept hoping for a change or turn in the storyline. From start to finish, a dreary account of the life of dreary self-absorbed man."
2,A word child.,I only read the first 5 or so chapters and felt that the story line was going nowhere and decided to delete the book from my kindle so I don't attempt to read it again. The fact that the hero was a govt. office manager doing rubber stamp work continued to show a very dull life for a hero in a story. I lost interest.
1,SICKO,"I forced myself to read half or more of this book, thinking it would develop into something readable. I decided either the author or the characters in the book were psycho. It was then I began reading a different book which was good."
1,Absolute torture!,"I made it 12 pages and just couldn't continue. It was not worth the $1.99, that I paid for it and I should have heeded all of the negative reviews. If suspected terrorists were forced to read it, it would be a violation of the Geneva Convention."
1,I wouldn't...,I wouldn't recommend this novel. It is tedious and boring. The characters are not believable. I could not put this book aside quickly enough.
3,Boring and Depressing,I cannot figure out why the other reviewers raved about this book. I disliked Hilary from the beginning of the novel.The spot of interest for me was the mention of my beloved London.
2,amazons: A Word Child,"I just couldn't get into this book. I kept reading long past where I should have quit hoping it would pick up, because it never did."
2,Scattered plot,Barely endured this book to the end. I never got to like the characters. They all seemed so shallow and diconected really. Main character is just plain stupid and never learns from his mistakes.
3,A British Chauvinist,"A well written book, but I had to force myself to keep going, even though I understood the plot by mid point.The main character is a total ass, imo. He abused all the women in his life, including his own sister, holding them all under his male chauvinistic thumb.At the end, when he has lost almost everything, he behaves better, but still resents it all in his mind. I think he never really loved any one except himself."
2,A Word Child.,"I did not like the book A Word Child by Iris Murdoch. It was tedious and boring to read, but I did finish it.I must be more careful when ordering bargin books."
2,Puzzled?,"I found this book very difficult to ""get into"". I keep going back to it, but it just does not appeal to me."
2,disappointed,"i was really expecting a great read, this one was very slow, wanted to slap hillary to get him to do more with all his intellect of languages, yet he just couldn't move beyond his pasttoo bad"
1,A word child,"I found it very boring it was hard to finish the book! It did not live up to how it was described , badly written, nothin as i was expecting."
1,Didn't enjoy this book at all,"I bought this as a Kindle Daily Deal, thinking it sounded interesting for $1.99. I thought it was quite horrible. Long and drawn out, it took too long to get to the point and had too much nonsense thrown in."
3,disappointed,"This title was deceiving. The author kept telling us this grown man liked to use words,but I didn't find much reference to a child. Maybe I missed something. It was a very sad story."
4,Slow start.,I found the beginning a little too wordy but once you get into the book you feel for the characters and get a better understanding of how peoples' mind work when things happen. It was a very good book.
3,Vintage Murdoch . . .,". . . and in the words of a wine connoisseur, a bit to dry and acidic for my pallet.I also need more paragraphs and pauses to catch my breath."
1,A Word Child,"This was one of the wordiest books I've ever read, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Somehow, I managed to finish it, but wondered why I bothered."
3,"Certainly not a Classic, but intresting to listen to.","Sonny Stitt was a sax player that followed the footsteps of Charlie Parker. On this album he plays a lot of classic songs, but the over sound of his solos are not the best. If you are a Stitt fan I'm sure you will enjoy this album otherwise it's only 5 bucks so get it anyways and listen to the way it was in 1970's. Good or bad."
2,"One hit wonders, baby. Buy GG & GEORGE JONES","Dreadlock Holiday (included here) had something about it. All their other songs blow. That song is worth securing though. If ya can't get it elsewhere, pick this up. While you're at it, pick up anything by GG ALLIN, GEORGE JONES, & JEANNIE C. RILEY on Amazon. Trust me on this."
4,The Very Best of 10CC,"I really like this CD. The lyrics have a dry wit to them, which I appreciate, and the variety in the music is great. The musicianship is also top rate."
4,"Love Me, Marietta by Jennifer Wilde","Love Me, Marietta is the sequel to Love's Tender Fury. Description from the book's back cover:Her Beauty Was Power ... Men fought to touch her, hold her, staked claim to her body and her heart.Derek Hawke, once her master, now openly vowed his love, promising her a place as mistress of his English estate. Red Nick, the cruel pirate, showered her with jewels and challenged her hauteur with his passion. Jeremy Bond, renegade mercenary who could charm any woman to his bed, risked his life to rescue her from her island prison.Love Me, Marietta ... men beseeched her, but Marietta Danver's spirit matched her beauty. She would keep her love for just one man!"
3,"Love Me, Marietta!",This book could have been excellent except there was no fulfillment between the two main characters. I am told the next book is worse.
4,my gale,the book was very interesting how the author describes everything i am glad able to find a copy of my gale wanting see the movie when it comes out.
4,CARROT! ::takes a mallet wham::,"You see the top the title thing? That is the whole book. It is very good. It is about some scourcer hunters. One, Carrot a boy gaga over girls and is constently chasing them. Tira, is the girl that helps out and not to metion her dirty side..... Marron is Carrot's younger (and not to mention very hot) younger brother he's specialty is eastern magic. This is a great book about these charactors and you'll laugh so hard you'll pee in your pants."
4,worth the purchase,"I first brought this book to try and find something new in anime reading and found it I did. I loved the charactors but especially Marron the hero's younger brother. The story line about a group of people whose purpose is to help those without magic from those who do and abuse it. There are funny and touching things going on in the story line that will stop you and make you think, like about family bounds. I cann't wait until volume 2 comes out to see what happens next to these guys and girls. If you cann't wait once you've read the volume one book to see more of there adventures; I suggest the video tapes to get a better feel of the story. I'm sure it'll prove funny and exciting."
2,Disappointed,"This unit worked ok, but I found I had to check the horizontal lines with my bubble level - they were not always accurate. The instructions claim that the line will be dashed if it is not level - it didn't seem to matter how much I tilted it - no dashed lines. Once the line was adjusted, it stayed level, but I wouldn't say that the self leveling is reliable."
4,"Great tool, great price","Works great, lines show up great even in sunlit filled room.Very handy for hanging multiple pictures at the same level.Only downside is small pinholes left in drywall, but they are very hard to notice."
5,Many uses,"I needed a laser level that had both horizontal and vertical lines and this one fits the bill. There are several ways to place it with the included mounting stand or use it by itself. You can sit it on a stand, table or tripod. You can also mount it on the wall with the 2 built in pins or hang it from a nail. It also has a hook to hang it from the ceiling. Try using the stand then place it across the room. You can then adjust the vertical line with the knobs on the stand. You can also adjust the horizontal line up or down by about 4 inches. You can also aim it into a corner and it will show on both walls. It has a bright solid line. If the line is broken or dashed then the unit itself is not level. I am finding more uses for this laser all the time and you probably will too."
2,workable for 2 months,"this is my first auto level and i was thrill the 1st time i use it. it worked great. all my project was perfectly finish using this black and decker BDL310S projected crossfire auto level. for about two months, i use it and now it stop working. none of the laser are working even after i replaced the battery as suggested in the troubleshoot. i just want to know where can i service this product in indonesia.please understand that i did not drop this black and decker auto level. it just stop working and i can't do anything with it now, so i have to buy a new auto level PLS4."
3,Adequate,"this Laser Level has the advantage of being self levelling within 5%, that is you have to place as vertical as you can but you do not have to get it perfect, it will do the rest. It has a clever feature, where if it cannot get it right it will display dotted lines. it is also easy to attach to the wall withe the 2 provided pins. on the downside, it is flimsy and cheaply made and fragile and certainly does not inspire confidence, it looks and feels like a cheap toy. The lines are rather thick when displayed on the wall. Last but no least, the tripod hole is 1/4 inch whereas most tripods 3/5 "" so yo have to buy $25 adapter."
4,Nice little unit,"This isn't the be-all and end-all of laser levels, but for the price it's a very nice unit. The out-of-level indicator that interrupts the laser beam when the unit is tilted too far to accurately self-level is a great feature which makes hand-holding reasonable for many tasks. This is good because the thing is otherwise a bit difficult to get into perfect position. To cast a horizontal beam, you essentially have to place the level at the exact height you want. There's an elevator adjustment on the mount that goes through a range of about six inches, but you need to get the unit mounted within that range on your own. I tried to use the tripod mount screw hole, but for some reason it doesn't fit with either of the camera tripods I have at home. The positive magnetic engagement with the mounting base is another nice feature. Still, I'm happy with it and would recommend it."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Excecution",Purchased for some home improvement project and it worked great the first few days of use. Four days after opening the box the vertical laser would no longer work. The horizontal laser still functions properly. I would have expected slightly better robustness for a product from Black and Decker.
4,Exactly as advertised,"Just got this. So far I've used it to hang a series of pictures on a wall at the same height. The surface mount works exactly as expected, the lines projected are clear and bright, and it adhered nicely to a fluid tripod. I checked the level lines projected against my fluid level, and as expected they lined up perfectly.The carrying case has room for storing a spare battery, a very nice touch.The wall mount is slightly confusing to use at first, but you'll get used to it quickly."
4,Cool tool...,"Works very well around the house. I've used it for hanging pictures and some shelves.One note: it doesn't seem to screw into my tripods (as other reviewers have noted) - the screw isn't long enough. I have tripods with both a 3/8"" and 1/4"" threaded screw. This level is 1/4"", so I picked up a Manfrotto 015 3/8-Inch Female to 1/4-Inch adapter and the adapter IS long enough to screw into the level! So if you happen to have a 3/8"" tripod, pick up this adapter (about $5 here at Amazon, or a good photography store) and it will screw into the base of the level!"
4,Hanging a Suspended Ceiling,"I used the product to hang a suspended ceiling and to make the ceiling level. I hung the laser in the center of the room at the desired height and went to work. No drawing lines, no strings. Very easy to use."
5,.Should have bought this a long time ago.,"Highly useful, highly accurate, and a professional tool. A real time saver also. Have used this tool frequently since I bought it. Sure beats the old fashioned carpenter's level."
1,Picture is Deceiving,The picture is not even close to what the speakers look like. I would skip this item because picture and sizes are incorrect.
1,This is not the Speaker shown in the picture,"I ordered this thinking it was a center channel speaker as shown in the picture. What I recieved was a pair of 5"" rectangular speakers. Not what is shown."
3,Wriiten for Access 2003,"I ordered this manual and it was not apparent from any of the pics or editor's comments, etc. that this was written for the 2003 version of Access. I should have noticed the publishing date (my bad). I haven't gone thru the book yet as I have other books in this order to go thru also, so the content may be fine, just dated."
3,Problem with illustrations.,"On the Kindle you can change the font size, which is great for me since my eyes aren't that good. The problem is that the illustrations, which are extracts of programs, are all too small and I can't read them."
4,Great Resource,Great book for providing a comprehensive overview of the value-add of MS Access and some of the practical appliations for which it is used. I would reccomend to anyone that wants to start experimenting with the capabilities of Access.
1,Very poor book,"This book was very boring, and after reading a few chapters, I still only know the same things I knew before reading this book (which is basically nothing). My husband and I were very disappointed that we lost our money on such a retarded book."
5,Raw and Powerful,"This fascinating DVD deals with Malcolm X's assassination and the role of both the Nation of Islam and the FBI in this. Min. Farrakhan's remarks against Malcolm (which he later regretted) earlier in the DVD are indeed shocking, and the recollections of Malcolm's old friends such as Brother Benjamin, historian John Henrik Clarke (shortly before his death) and Charles Kenyatta add a warm, human touch to the proceedings. Very educational for those interested in Malcolm and his effect on people."
1,Not like the original soft and supple,"Sadly, Swan has cheapened the Soft and Supple hose to the point where it should be named Hard and Stiff. I have five of the original Soft and Supple Swan hoses that I have had for 15 years and love them, but I recently purchased a new Soft and Supple hose and was stunned by the dramatic difference. Do not buy this hose! You will be disappointed! Dramm makes a nice supple rubber hose in six colors as does Sears (it looks like the Sears hose is made by Dramm, but comes in black only)."
1,KINKY HOSE,Saw a big sign at Lowes--Swan KINK FREE hose. Great! Got it home and it kinks about every two feet. What a swindle. Returning it tomorrow. Will take the advice of another reviewer and get a Sears Craftsman.
1,Save your money...this is garbage,"Bought two of these hoses yesterday from Lowe's locally. Hooked them up and one of them had muliple bulges and a spraying leak. The second had multiple bulges that indicate to me that a leak is in the not-to-distant future. I took them back and got a refund. Since the only brand Lowe's has in stock are all Swan brand hoses, I bought a ""Contractor Grade"" 75 ft Swan hose. I figured I would see if it leaked before buying another. I hooked up the new hose and it was leaking at the distal fitting. That hose goes back to Lowe's tomorrow.Don't buy a Swan hose. I know they used to be good hoses because I had two that lasted for nearly 15 years without any problems. Whatever they are doing as of 2010 with their manufacturing process is simply designed to sell their products, not make something of quality. One hundred percent failure rate to me indicates major quality problems. Their hoses are garbage."
2,Old Swan Afficionado,"First of all, thank you reviewers for taking time to comment on this product. Very helpful. I have two Swan hoses that I have owned for 27 years and they performed without failure. Sounds like the new product pales by comparison. I won't be buying another."
3,Quality Has Decreased!,"Unfortunately, my impression of Swan's Soft and Supple line has gone down. I've had a 50 ft. Swan Soft and Supple garden hose for over 10 years and it's in great shape. I wind it up after every use and don't step on it to prevent grinding dirt into the outer layer. However, the newest 25 ft. hose that I bought (last year) is obviously lower quality. The feel of the hose, how quickly the hose begins to show signs of small cracks and creases, and the ""windability"" of the hose is a lot different than my older one."
1,junk hose,bought this hose last yr. JUNK this yr. So I went to sears and bought 2 craftsman hoses 20.00 ea. that were on sale. life time replacement from sears even if you run over it with a mower. Beat that deal. last hose I'll pay for untill sears goes under.
1,Swan garden hose is not the same quality as it used to be.,"The 75 ft Swan garden hose which I ordered is definitely NOT the same quality as it used to be (i.e. ""soft and supple America's finest hose"")It is actually the worst hose I have ever seen. I have several Swan hoses which I purchased in the past several years. Although I have treated the new one the same as other hoses, I have had to mend the very thin and weak hose to try to get SOME use out of it. What a GYP! Whoever is making the hose and selling it under the Swan name should be stopped! Shame on them!"
1,Not what they used to be,"I've had two of these Swan hoses for 17 years, and needed to replace one damaged by a contractor. I bought 2 new hoses and they are not the same Swan hoses. One developed a pinhole leak about two feet from the faucet end after 5 minutes of use. I opened the second and found the wraping ties had been applied so tight that the hose was bent and crushed. I returned them both and bought 2 better quality hoses at the local hardware store. This used to be a great product."
2,Not so hot..,They say its kink resistant. NOPE... much thinner than I had anticipated... spend the extra $$ and get a thicker model. It kinks as it rolls up into my reel AFTER I've cranked it on the spool... haven't figured that one out yet. you get what you pay for..
1,Pinhole size leaks,"I didn't want to believe the bad reviews because I owned Swan hoses before and they lasted a decent period, so I decided to go with this brand again, knowing they back it with lifetime warranty. After a year, it started spraying water from pinhole size leaks, from a portion of the hose that doesn't get any wear and tear. It may be a manufacturing defect or the quality is definitely questionable now, but I'm sending it for warranty claim."
3,Soft but not kink-free,"While I have purchased this same hose in the past, I am slightly disappointed with this one. It not only kinks, but it leaks (sprays water) from the brass connector at the faucet. It's still probably better than most I've purchased (and it does have a lifetime guarantee), but cutting it up, sending it back and then waiting for a new one leaves me unable to water my plants--not good!"
1,Only Read to New None Believers!,"Like another concerned parent my 5 year old came home from school and informed me that the librarian had read this book, and that there is no Tooth Fairy. This books goes into details about how the parent ""wakes up in the middle of the night, sneaks in the bedroom, and takes the tooth!"" My daughter came home and explained her reasoning using this exact language. She clearly stated that the Tooth Fairy must not be true because the Daddy said so. :( We all know that at some point the magic will be gone, older children will share the secrets, it is all part of the process....but having a grown up confirm at just 5 breaks my heart! PLEASE if you are an educator/librarian/administrator keep this one off the shelves there are many other books of much higher quality that are much more worthy! Parents: this is a book to share with new non-believers transitioning to the grown up world!"
1,SPOILER- DON'T LET YOUR LITTLE ONES READ THIS!,"My little girl, who JUST had a few visits from the ""tooth fairy"" came home so upset today! She just read this book in SCHOOL and is mortified! She understood the older kids saying there isn't one but for the dad to confirm it in such detail? This left her in such a state of confusion! This would be a great book if you want to let your child know or if they are older but the review on it states it is written poorly, an older child may get bored. Unlike another review, I am angry that I did not get the chance to talk to her about it. I know kids will tell her but the dad confirming in the book makes a huge difference! I felt I was put in a position sooner than expected (although I am aware it is coming anyhow!). Not a book I would recommend unless you read first and are ready."
4,"Terrific book when asked, ""Mom are you the toothfairy?""","I've been hiding this book in our house...waiting for the moment to come....when either of my twins would ask, ""Mom, are you the tooth fairy?"" Last night it happened. I asked my daughter to wait while I grabbed the book (after letting my husband know 'it' was happening). We read it together and in the end it really helped transition from believing in the tooth fairy...to believing in the magic of the tooth fairy. My daughter really wanted a definitive answer and I was forced to say that yes, I was sharing the magic of the tooth fairy with her. This book really helped with that tricky moment. *I agree....not good to have out on the kids' shelf prior to that, but very good to share when the time comes."
5,"Does not lose, but enhances, the magic we want to believe","Those of you who read this and did not come out of it believing in fairies must have a different version than I have. Not only does it leave the magic intact, it gives roots to a child to carry magic with them throughout their life. A wonderful treatment of the tooth fairy dilemma. I wish I had heard my children's fairy and written notes for her."
1,This book should come with a WARNING,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK FOR CHILDREN WHO BELIEVE IN THE 'MAGICAL' EVENTS OF CHILDHOOD.My kindergarten-age son came home from school with this book. He had picked the book for the cover, but didn't know what the title was. When I saw the title, I gently took it from him and read it by myself. I was SHOCKED and ANGRY about the way the topic is handled. I am generally not in favor of censorship, but I do think this book should come with a warning for parents to read the book before they share it with children."
1,Read this book first before showing it to a child!!!,"This book blows the tooth fairy's cover. I made the mistake of reading this to my 6 year old son and having to stop midway through, quickly making excuses and smoothing over the blown secret in the book. I'll bet the next book in the series is called ""Mommy aren't you and Daddy Santa?""!"
1,I am COMPLETELY APPALLED by this book!,"This book SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING!!! My son bought this book at a school bookfair, and he brought it to me to read and even though I was wondering about the title, I felt that surely there would be some whimsical story spun from it. NO. It totally dispelled every magical work and idea that makes childhood fun. I tried numerous times to redirect my son, explaining taht it was fiction, or didn't he want a snack instead? But no, nothing worked, it was already to late. My son who had brought his elves to school the very same day and shared with his friends all the magic they had done, was totally devastated. It was not the way I had ever envisioned telling my son, and again, I am just completely saddened that this publisher and Mr. Alexander ever thought that this was a good subject for anyone but a parent to broach. I really felt like the ""fairy whispering"" theory was a poor attempt to smooth it over, it definitely didn't work for my child."
2,Yea...kind of gross.,"I bought 5 sticks of this deodorant for my husband online because he loves this deodorant and we can't find it in ANY store. Pro: the items came very fast. Con: they looked like they were USED!!! I mean, some were cracked, the plastic deodorant cover thing was off just jiggling around inside the cap, and I even found a HAIR on 2 of them. DISGUSTING!!!! I only gave 2 stars because of the fast delivery. Otherwise, if I could give 0 stars, I would. Who sells USED deodorant??!! Ugh!"
2,Not worth it,No noticeable difference in the air quality after use or in my wife's allergies. Thing broke alltogher after about 18 months.
3,A-Ok air purier but Loud.,"This unit is Ok. It is great for a small room about 12' by12'. It makes the room smell a bit fresher, kind of like before a rain. The constant FAN buzzing sound is louder than I want hear... but I got used to it! The buzzing may keep you from going to sleep as it did me."
2,beware of reviewer scams,"I bought this book based on the rave reviews. I find it to be quite a difficult read. And the ideas aren't as immediately useful as I thought. Maybe it just takes time to digest this thing. I am also very surprised a small book (less than 200 pages) costs so much. If you look at all the reviewers before me, none of them have written more than one review - this one! Please do yourself a favor, read this in the bookstore first before you buy it."
5,1984 Gibson 335 Custom Shop Flamed Maple,I went into a music store and wanted to buy a Gibson 335.They had 4 of these on the rack.After all these years I'm still amazed at how well this gutar plays.Simply put it does exactaly what you tell it to do and the action is so easy.The 335 covers the musical spectrum easily.I paid $850 back then and today I can't afford to replace it.I will die with it before I sell it. Gilbert Campagna
3,pretty good for beginners,i felt that this book helped me somewhat with learning how to draw manga. i recommend this book for beginning artists.
5,Overlooked and Underrated,"Kevin Max's album, Stereotype B, is an incredible work of auditory beauty. The lush sounds and rich lyrics are, as has been described her elsewhere, otherworldly. The album shines through the use of exotic instrumentation and Kevin's excellent lyrics and vocals. This is an album of new and fresh sounds rarely heard today through mainstream radio.For the Christians here who found the content to be lacking, just dig a little deeper. Remember that metaphor carries a truthful meaning beyond plain spoken language. For others who are scared to try ""Christian"" music, I think that enough comments have been made to support the case that this is not your poorly-made, subpar Christian ""pop"" album.At its very best, ""Steroetype B"" pure musical beauty; at its worst, it is an album that will see repeated play."
4,Definitely Kevin Max!,"Upon listening to this Album, you can really hear Kevin Max's contribution to the band DC Talk. I thought it sounded very new-agish. Kevin has a tendency to build up the music to enforce the emotion behind the song. Kevin's album, by far, is the best of the three solo albums published of DC Talk. If you are an avid DC Talk fan, you'll find something to be missing. Simply, b/c Tait & Mac are not included. And if you are a sold old junkie of DC Talk...you'll just like it anyhow."
3,OK,This cd is ok but it is defintly a step backwards for dc talk. IT IS NOT A 100% CHRISTAIN CD. If u like christain music (like me) dont check this out.
1,Revealing.,"Kevin has a unique voice. He got Adrian Belew to play some guitar. He even got Larry Norman to sing backup and play harp on one song. His song material has changed dramatically from DC Talk. He gives John Lennon, U2, Roxy Music, King Crimson, Beatles, Elvis, Queen, and William Blake higher special thanks than to ""Jesus and the Father and the Holy Spirit,"" who get virtually no coverage in the CD. In fact, Kevin sings, ""Oh dark mistress, my only salvation,"" on Dead End Moon. I wondered why the other DC Talker gave Kevin strange looks on their live CD. Now, it makes sense: ""despairing,"" ""blind,"" and ""the deranged world of (backmasking)"" How nice."
5,KMAX rocks!,"This album is the best of all three solo projects. The only reason I say that is because KMAX tries (and succeeds) to make his album appeal to EVERYONE, not to only Christians. All the songs were wrote so that a Christian could listen and enjoy it, and also a non-Christian, or an athiest. It's really awesome. My favorite tracks are Be, Shaping Space, Dead End Moon, I Don't Belong, and Her Game.I suggest this album to anyone who listens to: U2, Beatles, or John Lennon. The guitarist from the band is part of the band King Crimson. KMAX was inspired by these individuals, and though I'm only a fan of U2 out of those bands, I've had a lot of people say that he MUST be a big fan of those bands.The other solo projects are awesome; you should get those too!"
4,Different,"Out of the three DC Talk solo release, Kevin's proves to be the most daring release. Because Tait sticks with pop/rock and Toby sticks with hip hop. But Kevin hits all over the board with rock, rap, pop, techno, and some world beats. While this CD may not be everyones ""cup of tea"" his combination of these different styles makes for one weird but very interesting CD."
1,Terrible Editing,".... The editing in this textbook is terrible.The text regularly refers back to things saying ""as mentioned earlier in the text"" that are NOWHERE else in the text.The online Appendix C answer key for end-of chapter self tests is wrong an alarmingly high percentage of the time.e.g. from chapter 2 (There are only 15 of these questions!):#2. Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons are called __________.A. isotopesB. ionsC. isomersD. inert elements.... the answer should be A, but the answer key says C.#12. Which of the following is NOT a polysaccharide?A. ChitinB. GlycogenC. CelluloseD. Lipid... the answer should be D, but the answer key says B.The book is not a reliable study aid, and should not be recommended to students until it is properly edited."
5,definite must for ppl in the go,"Works great. I use it on the Asus Transformer Prime and my GSII, which makes reading super convenient. If I pick up one device and read the second will automatically ask what place I want to resume from the cell phone or the tablet. Amazing for reference because you can search and it will pull up anything to do with what you have requested. (ie. Search penicillin-it will locate every excerpt that has that word in it) I definitely recommend; my only wish is that there were more text books offered."
1,"We have not received this book, requesting a refund immediately.",I have not received this book to date. I am requesting a refund at this point because I had to purchase book from another source in order for my daughter to be current with her assignments.
5,Awesome,"This book was just like the seller stated it was on the site. I am very satisfied with the product. I will purchase more products from this site because of their truthfulness and honesty. This product is amazingly worth all the money spoent and more because I have learned alot from it. It has the same information as the new edition; however, you have to compare the two to see what is missing and what is there."
5,Great service ans product!,This seller is exellent. My book arrived very quickly and the book was in perfect condition...like new. I appreciated the price as well. Some of us cannot afford textbooks and these priced make them affordable. Will definitely buy from this seller again!
3,Book binding broke after only a week of use:(,"Very happy with the transaction. After using the book for only a week however, the spine that binds the pages together has split apart and is failing to hold the paper together. There seems to be an obvious quality control issue from the manufacturer/binding company.Had the book stayed in one solid piece like they all should, I would have been 100% completely satisfied."
2,Disappointed buyer,I was a little disappointed in the fact that the information from the seller said it was a new book (not used at all) and when I got it there were pencil marks underlining in a few of the chapters. Otherwise the actual condition of the book was great.
5,Big yuks in Old Greece,"Years (many years) ago when I was an English major at UMass, we were given two translations of Aristophanes ""The Birds"" to read in order to make a point about reading translations. One was by a translator whose name I forgot (and gladly so). The other was by Mr. Fitts. The first was as boring as the ininitiated would expect a Greek comedy to be. But Fitts version, far truer to the original according to our professor, was totally bizarre and remarkably funny. It is as vibrant and eye-opening as Fagles translations of Homer."
5,Great translation,"Aristophanes' The Frogs is not an easy read, and there are many poor translations available today which make it even worse. This translation was easy to follow and very well written. I am working on my MA in Theatre used this translation to write an adaptation of the play with a professor of mine. We found it to be the most modern adaptation that still maintained the integrity of the original piece."
1,Not good,The back cover was ripped off and pages were out of the book. I would like to let people to know that this was not a good person to buy books from. When selling a book they need to be in one piece!!
5,Hard to put down. Great story!,"Emma knew very little about th man she had met and married in the matter of weeks. But she did know she loved Barnaby Court very much.Then unpleasant rumors started, that Barnaby's first wife disappeared under mysterious circumstances; that no one really knew what happened to the two pretty young governesses who simply ran off without cause of explanation.Emma trusted her husband, she asked him no questions. But when a pathetic, lonely grave turned up in the field, her loyalty turned into cold, hard fear.Keeps you on the edge of your seat!"
2,Yawn... Wait for the movie version.,"One of those books that reads as if it was intended to be made into a movie.Readable. Some interesting background onsleazy New York jewelry dealers. The climax comes when the hero realizes a team of Mafia killers is out to get him. He goes to a few hardware stores and picks up a long list of items--plywood, a professional stapler, a cassette recorder, three six-ounce jars of red poster paint, etc. Over the next few chapters we get to see how he fashions these humble items into a diabolically clever, intricate booby trap which, of course, functions almost perfectly and allows him and his girlfriend to kill all six Mafia thugs..."
1,Tedious and sloppy,"I've read other novels by this author and enjoyed them, but this one is a loser. Browne attempts to use a vocabulary he apparently does not fully understand, he goes into stultifying detail in the most inappropriate parts of the story, and he is one of those poorly-informed crime writers who write about guns without knowing much about them. (I was slogging thrugh the novel until I got to the part where the protagonist ""put the revolver on safety."" Hey, wake up! Autoloaders and long guns have safeties; revolvers do not.) If you come across an abandoned copy of this book in an airport, go ahead and pick it up--it can keep your eyes busy if the crossword puzzle in the in-flight magazine has already been filled in, and you won't mind if somebody swipes the book before you finish it."
1,A loser at best!,"Having read all of Gerald A. Browne's previous books, this one really let me down. There were all kinds of unanswered questions and some totally unbelievable scenerios. I sure hope he gets back on track with his next book...."
1,Extremely cumbersome to read,"This narrative is written in first person with loads of British/Cockney expressions along with lots of rough language. The story isn't particularly engaging, may be better if you're a guy reading it."
3,give us a fag and neck a lager,"The dialect is so thick in this book that I thought at first maybe it hadn't been translated into English. If you stick with it you will be able to interpret the words according to content.Blake is a doorman/bouncer for a local pub. When he doesn't stand up to one of the Munster brothers the rumor spreads that he has lost his bottle/courage. When he sets out to restore his reputation everything starts going downhill. Murders, disappearing bodies, betrayal by his mates. Had to laugh at the attempts at disguise and his weird code of ethics...never hit a bird(woman).If you laughed at the wood-chipper scene in the movie ""Fargo"" you will find this book hilarious. This is not your usual thriller/mystery but good for a change of pace."
4,Well written!,Very different and interesting characters-was not sure if I was going to like this one. But as you got more into it I could not put it down!Give this one a try!
2,Deadfolk,"The language in the book was hard to read as well as hard to follow. The majority of the book was boring although it did get more interesting toward the end. However, the ending left you hanging."
1,You get what you paid for,"This holster didn't fit ANY of my pistols. (I have a Cyma Desert Eagle, UHC 1911, UTG MK23 and a Cyma CM030 Glock) Waste of money"
5,Not politically correct!,"You gotta Love Titus. He is a genius. I Loved Norman Rockwell is Bleeding, and the 5th Annual End of the World Tour had its moments, but ""LIE"" is great. I believe it stands on it's own. I've already watched it about 10 times and still catch things I didn't before. Well worth the price and a lot cheaper than seeing him live, which I have done. A must see!"
5,LOVE IT,I loved this comedy show.. the DVD came via mail really fast and in good quality! I have no complaints!
3,"Funny, but not hilarious","Titus has great material on divorce and dating, but over uses the ""inner retard"" acting."
4,Better than Turismo 3,"As a fan of Gran Turismo since it's inception, I would say it keeps getting better. The game is so addictive I have to put a timer on to remind myself to stop playing. The courses are well designed and the graphics awesome. I like the big selection of racers from all over the world. Vrooooooom, over the top!"
2,Steering wheel is a must have to enjoy!,"I got this game for free when I bought my PS2. I've played it at best buy when they had a display set up using a steering wheel with force feedback and pedals and it was a total blast! It felt like I was actually sitting in the car driving it. It helped too that I was sitting in best buy's racing seat office chair. On the flip side, I have tried playing this game at home using the ps2 controller alone and it is pure toture. I think it is the most boring game I have ever played that way. the controls are just too hard and it's a driving simulator game so theres no getting a ""turbo boost"" and just rocking through a race. It feel like i was back in drivers ed trying to pass the test for my license. Get the steering wheel and get a good one like logitech's G25! I'd give the game five stars with the steering wheel."
4,First Impressions,"Just got the game and started to play it. The graphics of the race tracks have been improved greatly. The car graphics are just like GT3, but add more detail to the shading and an actual driver. Also, there are three views while you race that you can chose from.So far the good things I have seen are the ability to transfer credits (100,000) and licenses (B and A) from a GT3 save game file.I have come across problems with the screen shaking on one dirt track and after you win a race on certain courses.Overall if you like GT3, I would recommend that you get this."
5,Is it available yet?,I am wondering if someone who has played this can e-mail me at MichLeeHar@aol.com? I am trying to buy this for Christmas for my hubby! Thank you!
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with the final product, all the hype led me to thinking much more of it."
2,What the...?,"After a long time playing with GT3, only thing that wasn't there and won't be there in the 4th installment is Online. First they say no, then yes, then guess what, no again. This game is going to play just like the last, only improvment is the newly added cars, still gameplay is the same, from the Prolouge game that came out on early August, and well, that's it. The no.1 driving sim my A$$, there's no online mode, they kept me waiting saying that it'll be online, and when they announce the official release date, they manage to say that it's not online. How does Sony, the publishers of this game, don't seem to add in their trademark online mode? Makes you think!! NOT!Guess i'll have to wait for Need For Speed Underground 2, atleast that game has online mode, the heck with wasting my cash on this garbage."
1,reed thiss please before buying the game!!!,OK The games is good i played for 4 hours and the is the same game that gt3 the changes are the graphic and a lot of car and courses but the exauts system is the same sound iven if you upgrade de exauts is the same saund that is like lame and is the same you have to get licens to race another races money to buy cars an to upgrad same price is the same game is fun by the hour because is new but is the same this is disaponing i have being weaiting for 3 year for this game i dont realy recoment you this game save the money and buy the PSP...
3,"""Shocked""",This is Gran Turismo 4. Rated E for everyone this was being compared to Halo 2 as the best video game anywhere. It was number 2 next to Halo 2 (now it is number 1). I was expecting a lot from this game. But this game disappointed all the hype I heard about this game. The graphics are atroicous and I didn't feel like I was behind the wheel in this game. The game's slogan states that it is a real driving simulator. They will have to do better than this. All the hype disappointed me and let me dow. Good luck Sony but I am not sold.
1,Why?,"Why is everyone writing reviews when the game isn't scheduled to come out until January? Yes, I'm glad you want to pre-order it, but you don't need to post a review!"
1,upsetting,I gave this as a gift for my brother and once he tried playing it he realized that the game didn't even work at some parts of it so its not worth buying games if they are toooo cheap! >:(
4,Ernesto Jose,"I received the game on time, and my son is happy because, it has a lot of car, diferent options and is a game that can be use for all family."
3,Some problems.,"This game is fun but it's more like a huge expansion pack. No worries there, it's a good ride. Lots of cars to choose from.The problems:- Developers seemed to have ignored the multiplayer option. Replays can only be shown on split screen. (Not a big deal if you don't care.)- No driving aids available for 2 person battle on garage cars. Tire spin for an entire lap could be avoided.- Terrible instructions.- ""Data corrupted"" on memory caard after completeing %75 of game. Read online that this can happen.It was fun, but I'm taking it back. I'll keep my GT3, though."
5,this is a real driving simulator!! no fast and furious,"THIS IS A DRIVING SIMULATOR!!!! of cuz cars wont be like games that got slap together in a few months by other companythis is probably as realistic as you can get for a racing gameif u are thinking about something like fast and furious you probably shouldnt get it. it might be too realistic for you.beside that the game graphic is great, i can feel the difference in every car i driven, i actually have more fun doing license test than actually racing. the sound fx and music is a little disappointing though.now all i wonder is if i can use this game to test drive cars instead of going to the car dealers..."
3,Disappointing,"I read the reviews and went to GameSpot and downloaded a bunch of video clips. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The starting point requires too much work that was not fun (unlike Burnout, where you also have to work a lot at the beginning, but it is more fun). My son played it once and it is already headed to the resell bin. I gave it more of a chance, but it didn't take long for me to come to the same conclusion."
2,Anyone want a helping of really bad physics?,"I liked GT3 AND loved! GT2, so let me begin by saying this game does not measure up...The sad part is that there are a ton of cars, including used cars and really neat historical cars but that is not enough to save this game. My problem with this game is that driving cars is too darn hard, I cant even corner going 60 in a super car most of the time!What else is wrong? NO F1 CARS!! I really dont know how they avoided putting them in this game. It was too tough to drive with cheap cars and the same was true for super cars, just stick with gt3 and save yourself the headache"
4,The hottest game to be unleashed,"GT3 was an awesome game, from the tune ups to the formula ones. I tried the prologue of GT4, and WHOA. The graphics were awesome, but it was only 80 % done in the prolugue.And for those supercars lovers, there wil be lamborghinis, ferarris, and the Mclaren F1 GTR. There will also be the real car physics (the acceleration, handling, and top speed), and the race tracks extremely detailed. This is a best buy"
1,I'm tired of waiting for GT4,"I pre ordered in January 2004, and 9 months later still no game (babies are born quicker than this game is released). This is terrible public relations. Doesn't Sony have the money to hire the best software writers? I'm not impressed."
3,NO ONLINE,I was going to get this game but I seen that you can't go online and race on this game. there is no good racing game out there that is realistic and goes online. I will buy the game when it comes out with online options
2,Ridiculously the worst racing Game!,This game is pure hype! There is absolutely nothing fun or entertaining about this game. It successfully irritates me and is slow as my grandma walking down stairs. The day Midnight Club DUB edition comes out couldn't be soon enough.
4,fun,"The game is fun, but suffers from the same thing that all the gran turismo games suffer from. It takes too long to play any of the advanced races. As you progress in the game, the races get longer and longer. This sucks, because I want a challenge, not a time sink. There is also not enough structure to the game for my liking. My favorite part is the license exam, because the challenges are fixed, and you can't just upgrade your way past the race."
2,its basically the same as before,good game but its basically the same as gt3. the only difference is the graphics are better and there are more cars.the ai is the same!!! thats not a good thing. with all of the time sony has had tweeking the game. it has been a major disappointment.if this game had come out in 2001 it would of been astonishing. but now its just the same as gt3.
3,Fun but weird,"The game has everything I could ever want in a racing game, lots of cars, fun tracks, good graphics. but the game has a very weird sort of handling system for the cars that I have to get used to. I don';t know if it's realistic or not. But, all in all if you want to buy this game, I would recommend buying the wheel too, because the handling with the controller is kind of odd."
4,A great game but not much different than the predacessors,"Tons of cars, excellent detail in the courses, great reality factor, long game...thats the good...the bad to me is the repetiveness of the game. Save up money, buy a car, pump that car up, win a race...save up money buy a car pump it up win a race etc...just goes on and on. The license tests are pretty annoying too...I mean, I could win the race with my driving skills before I get the license, what is the point? Over all, if you never played the Turismo series you will love this game, if you played the others this will seem like a newer version and nothing more...oh, and the fact that there is no Lamborghini or Ferrari really sucks!"
3,good game but....,"this is essentially just gt3 with bettter graphics. overall its a dissapointment. my two main complaints are the very inadequate instruction manual, it doesn't explain the details of the game like driving techniques. one of the hardest things to figure out to a new palyer is the toughness of the automobiles. the instruction manual is really poor. i knocked off one star for that.my other complaint is that the ai is the same as gt3. nothing has been fixed. what was sony thinking. but i juess for the all teh people who bought this it doesn't matter. if a person is willing to purchase an inadequate product and pay for it then whey should sony care.i had to go to the internet to learn how to steer these cars. only buy this game if you are desperate."
3,Not what I expected but its ok,"Maybe is a really cool game, and maybe its is because its a simulator. But the truth is that I don't think that in real live driving cars is so difficult. Gran turismo is a funny game if you want to do everything from the start: get you drivers license, race to win money, buy cars, etc. The only thing I cant understand is how come its so difficult to control a car in this game!.Other thing I dont like is that Gran Turismo 4 doesnt gives that ""real"" feeling. I mean, you are driving at 200 Km/h and it looks like if you were going really slow.But for the rest I have been playing it for a while and, even when its not exactly what I spected, it can give you moments of fun."
4,Best car and track graffic's in video games,"Game is great except for two things, first is you only have one choice of view when racing the cars, no longer can you watch the whole car from the roof camera or see the whole car just behind it. Also there still is no damage found on the cars no matter how hard you hit a wall or another car, very unrealistic."
1,Downgrade from GT3,I have GT2 and GT3 - Great games! GT4 was a huge disappointment. I could hardly drive the cars with the PS2 controllers. They were overly sensitive making the cars hard to control. Maybe the wheel and pedals would improve the gameplay.
5,Gran Turismo 4 Will Be Incredible!!!,"Of course this game will be nasty. Look at the first three. They were so innovative and great. This game is going to have A Spec and B Spec views and something like 2000 cars. Old and New. I am pretty sure a '70 Chevelle 454 is in here as long as a Volvo 240(Which has never been in any game). What I have heard and seen in the trailers, I am lining up on December 14th and buying this game. Do the same if you want a real driving game and not one that you can hit and wall and still keep going 140mph (NFS). Buy it!"
1,Most reviews were positive but they were wrong.,"Just as a disclaimer, my standards are very low when it comes to racing games. So when I say this game sucks, I mean most normal gamers will think this game sucks.I loved GT3 so I thought this would be an improvement. But I was wrong. This game sucks in every possible way, interface sucks, the graphics are worse than GT3, and the events are the same as GT3. The license tests are embarrassing to the franchise.I was hesitant to buy the game in the first place but after I saw the positive reviews on amazon (124 5stars and 36 1stars) I thought that many people can't be wrong, but I was SOOO WRONG. Those people were either paid off to make good reviews or the sellers of the game made fake reviews to con us into buying it. Either way they were wrong.PLEASE DO NOT waste your money on this game."
3,NO ONLINE !!! No Way !!!,"I thought this was supposed to be online. That was the only reason I was excited for this release. Don't get me wrong, I like the gameplay, but you get so much more out of a game when it's online. In fact, all of the games I buy now are online. That alone will keep me from buying this game. I may pick it up in 6 months or so when it sells for around $20. May be worth the money at that point. Note to Sony... Get this game online. There are no racing games online yet that offer true closed course racing. At least not a good one that I have seen. Please release a version of this game online. I will definately buy it and so will at least 5 other people I know."
1,buy GT2!,"I dident like gt3 when I got it, it came with the ps2 ""slow to update"" anyway i dident like it graphics were inproved but 2 things hapened more than half the cars vanished and the steering radious went to none so I got gt4 for my b-day form a store but it dident play literaly put the disk in nothing 17 disks same problem the store sent all of em back so I rented a copy. horible!! it has fuer cars than gt3! yah its got model t's buy who in their right mind races with a top engine speed of 34.8 mph take this advice BUY GT2 FOR $2.00 if you want internet play gt3"
1,WORST GAME EVER!,"This game is terrible! Go buy Burnout 3 or NFS Underground 2, they are MUCH better games and much cheaper. I've played many bad games before, but this is the worst!!! :K"
1,completely and utterly sucks,"I wanted a game that was cheap and something you could just turn on and play. This game sucks because they made it almost to real. I couldn't even make a basic turn in the game to get the license. I quickly turned it off and never touched it again. My roommate is a video game fanatic who basically completed the previous Gran Turismo installment and even he said that it sucked. Be wary, video gamers, buy the 3rd one used and stay away from this one."
4,Nintendo DS Lite 4-in 1 Charger,Works great for car charging and outlet charging. I have not tried the computer charging capablility.
1,won't work with vista!!!,"omg this sucks! i wanted to play this game so bad, but it won't work with vista! i'm reluctant to try anything after reading the other reviews about messing up the computer. i may go to the website...but it's a major bummer!"
1,DOESN'T WORK,"I purchased this product last year, but wasn't able to install it until this year, when I did it didn't even play. It installed fine, but it locks up and won't get beyond the first scene in the case. NOT HAPPY WITH THIS. A WASTE OF MY MONEY AND TIME."
2,Pictures Only...,"TWO stars for nice photographs!! This is a PICTURE BOOK. NOT a LITERARY contribution!! There is a short ""historical"" introduction regarding the origins of chenille and that's it!! Collectors can learn more about chenille art, history, popular patterns and prices by watching auction activity through the internet! Purchasing this book was a complete waste of money!"
3,"Lovely photography, little history!","Being from Dalton, Georgia; where Catherine Evans Whitener, is tributed to be the ""Mother"" of the ""Hand Tufted Bedspreads, I was anxious to find a 'real book about chenille bedspreads!'The introduction is very nice, however 'around here', US Highway 41 was know as ""Peacock Alley"", not Bedspread Bulevard. Before Interstate 75 was built, many homes and businesses did sell thier homemade spreads by hanging them on the line. Perhaps more than Thomas Deaton's book would have been helpful for her research! Come to Dalton and visit the Crown Gardens and Archives or to Cartersville's historical Museum to really find the complete history of the Chenille Spreads!Information under each photo, with hand or machine tufted would be very helpful for the reader!I am glad to have the book in my Bedspread Library, however, a trip to North Georgia would have benefited the authors to understand the exact information desired by readers."
3,Some chenille,"This book is good for early chenille bedspreads but does not show any of the ""newer"" makers like hofmann or Cabin Craft. Very small mention of Morgan jones. Not very complete."
2,"Acceptable, but expensive via mail order","The couplers work as expected and seem to be of fine quality. However I found pretty much the same thing cheaper at Wal-Mart (and no shipping costs). I could be mistaken, but the ""gold"" simpler refers to the color and not the material used for plating. Either way, even if they are gold(Au) plated this is not of value to me."
5,great britain,This book is one of the best I have seen in that it covers enough history to be interesting without being boring. All the illustrations are high quality. The organisation by region is excellent. It was a gift to one of my daughters and also to my grandson Rory. Rory is spending a semester in England.
4,Great Supplemental Guide,"This book lives up to its slogan: it shows you what the others only tell you. The pictures are beautiful and the maps are excellent--much larger than you would usually find in other guidebooks.The guidebook also covers British history, food and money. Because of the amount of illustrations and pictures, however, it would not be the only guide I would buy if traveling to Britain. I would recommend this book as a complement to other guidebooks from which you could get more detailed info on lodging and prices."
4,Great if you do not need practical information,"This book features fantastic photos in high gloss and some great bits of information. But if you're looking for a travel guide with hotels and restaurants and practical information, stick to the Let's Go guide or the Lonely Planet guide or Rough Guide. All in all it's a beautiful book."
5,Big book...lots of info!,"When I received this book in the mail, I was quite surprised at its size. It's thicker than some of the other Eyewitness travel books, but this should not discourage you! There is so much information that one can get very engrossed in reading and learning from it for hours on end. I found the maps extremely useful and the different sections divided up for easy referencing made locating places to eat, hotels to stay at, and things to see very quick and easy. What a wonderful guide! The pictures are superb and it really is a clever travel companion. I've found the Eyewitness travel books to be very smart and practical...a real asset to the frequent, casual, and even business traveler. I recommend it highly as a companion guide to other travel books you may acquire about Great Britain, however it could do the job quite well on its own also."
5,Beautiful and helpful book!,"I bought this book not for travel but to help me visualize places I was reading about in various historical novels. It certainly helped it all come to life! The graphics and photos are wonderful. Since that time, I've also used the book whenever I want to do ""armchair travel"" - stimulates the imagination and provides hours of interesting reading."
2,Beware--it may not fit your hose,Did not work with my hose. Very difficult to determine which one will fit my hose as the informaiton is not available. Too late to return as I installed it well after purchase.
4,crash dummies are cool,"Finally hot wheels has got a well made product out. We bought this for our 5 yrld son. He wanted a car, but at the time they were not available. So we settled for this. We like it. It is a great way to change things up a bit. There's not many toy's out there for 4-5 yrld boys that are of good quality and don't use batteries. I recommend the crash dummies."
1,"""Good"" Condition - Not Really","This is an adorable story written by a first grade class. I wanted to add a copy to my classroom collection. However, it's the first and probably last time I'll ever buy a used book online. I expected a book in ""good"" condition would show signs of use. I did not expect to find pen and marker scribbles throughout the book, torn and taped pages, and stained pages as if something has been spilled on the book. Looks like a book that was salvaged from the trash."
3,More useful as a level,"I've used this over the years as my goto stud-finder and laser level.Overall I say it's done a decent job. It might be worth it's money as a line laser for occasional use, but as a stud finder I've found it really doesn't cut it. Sure, it finds studs most of the time, but at the expense of marking up your walls with the black felt underneath."
3,Don't leave the included batteries in there.,After very little use (maybe it had been sitting on a warehouse shelf for a while) the included Black and Decker batteries corroded and destroyed the contacts. Now I need to either solder some new contacts in or buy another unit.
2,Horrible!,"I have had a horrible time with this item. I can run it over an area on my wall, and it says I have electrical wires and a stud there. Run it over the same spot again and it finds neither. Try it again on the same spot and it finds the stud and no wires. I guess the third time is the charm with this thing. I would not recommend it to anyone. The level works though. LOL I guess that's what I paid for. Hmmmm."
1,Poor quality,"The stud finder is inconsistent and never displays ""edge"" of stud function as the instructions state it will. The laser level ""line"" was more like a fuzy blob of light. I took it back and am very disappointed in B&D quality."
4,good product,"Smaller than the last model. The LCD display provides DUD, Edege ... information, it's much more convenient than the last model."
4,does what it needs to do,"the stud finding capability works fine, and the laser levels real nice. good range on the laser, but I don't like the fact that you have to pin it in to the wall. So far, I've used it for paintings and shelves, and the holes are covered up by the thing itself, but one of these days, I'm going to want to use it as a reference between two independent hanging items, or for some other thing, and I'll have to devise some way to hang it without puncturing the hole. Its a small hole anyway, no big deal."
3,"Laser is good, wall mounting is misleading, stud finding is not accurate","Laser is good, wall mounting is misleading, stud finding is not accurate. Though I still use it find stud, I don't trust it anymore.Won't buy it if i were have a chance."
4,Works well.,"I am very happy with this product. I only wish that it had the combination horizontal, vertical laser lines, stud finder and auto wall distance measurement."
1,Junk,Couldnt find a stud if there was no sheet rock on the walls. I still have it and everytime I use it i want to throw it out. I finally just did ! !
2,Stud finder does not work,Do not buy for a stud finder. Absolutely horrible. My wall now has multiple holes in it from trying to find a stud. Thanks goodness it's in the closet. Arghhh! So frustrating!
1,Poor Laser. Worthless.,"The laser's accuracy is downright miserable. For example...a simple project...align two picture frames along a wall. You'll be lucky if you can get within one inch top to bottom. The line ""looks"" so far off you grab your conventional level."
2,not very usefull,I suppose the leveling is OK but I was very disappointed in the stud finder. When I tried to locate the studs in a wall it SEEMED to work. I tried several times and it behaved the same. When I sank the screws in however I hit nothing! Out of 7 studs I thought I located I actually hit something at 4 locations. This device goes back on the shelf as a paperweight!
2,Lemon???,"I like the way this mounts to the wall. A small pin hole that is never noticed. I had a previous model that was great, until I left it on a job site.I got this one it, mounted it, and checked it for level. 10 ft run, it was out more than 1/2"". I may have gotten a lemon, I don't know. But it seems like the quality was less than what my older model was. I may try again in the future."
2,Black & Decker BDL190S BullsEye Auto-Leveling,"Hi again,I don't like this product. You need to put a small hole into your wall to hang this. I sold this to someone, and bought a Ryobi laser level that uses suction power, than a pin from Black and Decker.Thomas"
5,THIS WOMANCHILD IS BLESSED,"I have been hearing mumbles about Alicia Keys in magazines months before her debut. And I have to say that she is all that, a sandwich and a bag of Baked Lays. She has the intelligent beyond her years and a talent that will have her around for many years to come. Clive Davis is a mad genius to have signed a bonified entertainer for his new label. if I could give her more than five stars, I would. She reminds me of Patrica Rushen and Roberta Flack, a dash of Stevie, a hint of Mary, and the duration of Aretha. Go on Alicia Keys......Spread your music"
5,One Of The BEST CDs I've heard in a LONG time!!,"I totally disagree with supermindpower on Alicia Keys' ""Songs In A Minor"". Her lyrics are poorly written! Man PLEEZE! ""Fallin"", ""Troubles"", and ""A Woman's Worth (that's her next single, for all the peeps that wanna know what Alicia's next single's gonna be), three of the standouts on her CD I can TOTALLY understand and relate to. The woman's only 20 yrs old! Give her a break! It's her first album and she's young. She's got PLENTY of time to grow and mature as an artist and her music and her lyrics will mature as well. This is REAL music. Some of the albums that came out this year were weak and total disappointments, like Destiny's Child, Tank, and Koffee Brown. But Alicia's CD is one of BEST CDs that dropped this year. You ain't a real music fan. Get your ears checked! Anyway, the standout cuts are ""Mr. Mann"", ""Fallin"", ""A Woman's Worth"", ""Girlfriend"", ""Troubles"", and ""Butterflyz"". Y'all heard tha single, SO GO COP THA CD YA HEARD?!"
2,I don't believe the hype,"Neo classic soul? Please.Alicia Keys is pretty and has a pretty voice, but the song writing just didn't do it for me. She has talent in that she plays almost all instruments on her album. But just because you can do something, doesn't mean that you should. I think this album could have benefitted a little more from some more experienced songwriters and instrumentalists.I never was a fan of ""Falling"" but I do enjoy ""Butterflies.""In my book, you can't just sample a piece of a classical masterpiece, mix it with some beats and call it original.This album sounds like it was made by India Irie or Jill Scott's little sister."
4,Alicia Keys unlocks your soul.,"First a warning. ""Piano and I"" contains an expletive. If you're trying to decide whether you should be in or stay in a relationship this IS THE CD for you! Her style is a mixture of the sadness of Roberta Flack and the Determination of Aretha Franklin. The most unique track is ""A Woman's Worth"" in it she sings ""A real woman knows her man comes first. A real man ain't scared to please her,and a real man can't deny a woman's worth."" The stand out on the cd is ""How Come You Don't Call me."" Which like the single ""Fallin"" takes my soul on a roller-coaster,but I ENJOY every height and dip. ""The Life"" borrows from Curtis Mayfield's Superfly soundtrack right down to the ""tryin to get over."" The rest of the CD is good but nothing special."
4,A delightful lil' songbird!,"Alicia Keys is a very unique artist with original, instrumental, melodious songs that put you at ease if you're groovin' in the car or just chillin' in your room. What's great about Alicia as an artist is that she writes and arranges all of her songs and plays the instruments; you gotta respect that refreshing sense of DEDICATION and INTIATIVE in an artist so young! Though ""Fallin'"" was sorta her breakthrough hit, there are other great songs on the album like Track #11 ""MR.MAN"" feat. Jimmy Cozier, ""Jane Doe"" and ""Troubles"" which all have good harmonies. With all the hype and adulation for her style, I sorta had greater expectations for the album but found that most tracks were just about the same. STILL, I would recommend this album for people who appreciate rhythm/blues and soul music... Alicia Keys is a PLUS!"
5,"PLEEZ, 5 STARS WONT EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THIS CD!","I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED WHEN I LISTENED TO THE CD 4 THE FIRST TIME, WELL ID ALREADY HAD 4 DOWNLOADED SONGS OFF OF HER DEBUT ALBUM AND I KNEW THAT THEY WERE HYPE. MY MOM KEPT SAYING ""I DONT THINK THAT U WILL LIKE IT ITS TO JAZZY"" BUT I PROVED HER WRONG NOW NON-STOP IN MY STEREO SYSTEM IS ALICA KEYS' SONGS IN A MINOR THIS CD IS A BUETIFUL CALOBORATION OF JAZZ HIP HOP&R&B AND I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS ALBUM IT IS VERY BEUTIFUL."
4,Young Diva,"One of the best cd's i've ever heard. Miss Keys has proven her self to be more than the you'd expect. Given the number of bubble-gum pop princess her age, Alicia is certainly a shock to the music world. Instead of following on the hills of other young artist alicia has created a sound, album that are anything bubble-gum pop. Well worth the buy"
3,Neutralized Album,"There are some fun moments in this album, and there are the lows. Alicia Keys first album is less better than the second, but still the songs get justice from her powerful voice.Majority of the songs are ballad. Here are some of the songs:Exceptional Tracks:GirlfriendFallinA Woman's WorthGoodbyeAverage Tracks:Piano And IHow Come you Dont Call MeJane DoeFiller Tracks:Everything ElseIf You Would like to purchase it, get it with ""Diary Of Alicia Keys""."
5,Come see what a Woman's Worth,"Its rare I actually buy an artist's first album when her second album comes out, but Alicia is something of a transcendentalist.Because of her awesome talent to write and composer her own music, she thus pours her heart out in each song.The more you listen to this album, the more you appreciate her gift.THe best bets:""Fallin"" 9/10,""How come you don't call"" 10/10""Rock Wit You"" 10/10""Jane Doe"" 8.5/10Now, its not that you won't dig the other songs, but trust me, every day you listen to this album, your favorite ones WILL change, and that's why this will be one of the Classics of the Future."
5,I'm Fallin for This CD!!!,"wow this cd is awsome! alicia keys is sooo young and talented. my older sister played the piano for years and i loved it, so that's one of the main reasons i'm fallin' for alicia's tunes. but her voice is like an angel's! u have to get this cd if u haven't already. you'll listen to it ALL the time, i betcha!! lol. of course the best songs are woman's worth and fallin, but caged bird and others will amaze you. i hope she wins many, many awards. :)"
4,"Media Hype Aside, Still A Good CD","The entire CD may not be a great example of either neo-soul or singer-songwriter talent, but as a whole, it is one of the few CD released last year where just about every track is worth listening to. For those who weren't swept into the media frenzy after the release and extra-long milking of the single Fallin', the songs on this CD are worth a listen with an open mind. Tracks like Girlfriend, How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore, A Woman's Worth, and Jane Doe make it fun."
4,"A Great Debut, Promising Career","I love Alicia Keys, but I must admit she is a little over-rated. However, she is much, MUCH better than alot of artists of her generation. This is a great debut from this beautiful and talent woman. Having said that, I found alot of her music reminding me or sounding similar to other songs. I found this less innovative on her part. Maybe she needs to work with other people. I don't know, but I fear Clive Davis kept this album from being as soulful as it could have been (think Whitney Houston). Her songwriting is something I can relate to and the emotions she shows when she sings touches me. This is a must have album, but she needs to come a little stronger the next time."
1,Alicia Keys Songs in A minor (new version),"I noticed the new jacket cover on the album when I was purchasing it but nowhere was it written in the info that the songs had changed from the original album. The printing on the corner is NOT readable in the ad, I could not find the original album listed, so I thought this was it and the cover had just changed.I was PISSED when I listened to the album because two of my favorites had been changed and I thoroughly DISLIKED the new versions. It was one of those....why did they bother to do this? Didn't they understand that the song was BETTER in it's original version?They called the tunes expanded....I call them RUINED!!!!!!!!! I want the original version. Can I buy it anywhere?"
3,da most beautiful girl after aaliyah and halle berry it is alicia keys she is my 3rd lady after aaliyah and halle berry,n 2001 i new i saw a female star n da making after watching da classic hit video fallin at da end of da video i saw how talented and beautiful this girl was that i didn't no what 2 do she took my breathe away every since but now i want her 2 start make music again it is time it has been almost year since i have since a new music video from her about this album even though i didnt hear it all had song good songs that i did hear it was girlfriend her first video fallin her second video and women's worth which was her third and finally video i saw her made from her freshman album
2,Alicia Keys talented yet not talented?,okay dont get me wrong fallin is beatutiful and so is girlfriend how come you dont call me and the intro is also cool she is a very earthly chick and i love the voice and how she can hold a note something was missing though i just dont know what.....................
3,"Good, But Not the Best","Alicia put forth a great effort with this cd. It turned out okay and has its high points. However, there are other artists out there such as India Arie, Mary J. Blige, and Lauryn Hill who really show what true music is all about. Songs In A Minor is definitely not in the same category as their albums. I think that Alicia should start to write her own songs and be more creative. Definitely not deserving of 5 Grammy's, the message from the album tells the story of a young girl who is very insecure when it comes to relationships. Overall, this album was a great effort. Alicia has potential, and hopefully she will use it to her advantage in the future. This project was definitely over-rated."
3,Good debut but not Great,"Ms. Keys has what it takes to be really good, but you won't see it on this album though. It is basically an album built around one song - Fallin'. There one or two other songs which will pique your interest but the rest are mediocre at best. But hey give it a shot and go buy it, but I could help it, I'd borrow it from a friend and have a listen first before rushing out to get one."
5,speechless at the talent,Hey this is one of the best albums i have ever listened to!!When i first heard it it was ok but after a while it is what i listen to day and night. Its just amazing to me how she can play all the insruments sing and write the songs all in one!!the blues jazzy type is the thing that caught my eye when i first heard it. well not much moe to say. but if you didn't get the cd your in for a surprise but if you don't like it then whatever floats your boat. this album is the best and has no words to describe it.
4,A for Songs in A Minor,"The saying that goes it's not the destination but the journey that makes the trip worthwhile. This is what Alicia's music does for me, she makes the journey well worth my while. I can see her with time becoming great, great, great. There were parts of the CD that I loooved. There were also parts that I couldn't tolerate. There is wonderful talent here. When I listen to the CD it's kinda all over the place. If there were more focus I think I'd be more in love with this album. There's a rawness that I like. I think maybe there's a sweetness about Alicia that should somehow allow itself to creep into her music. I'm extremely impressed and I want to hear more from Alicia. I want to see where time and experiece take her music."
3,She has developed more,"The first CD was a little overhyped, but so are many many other ones. I won't even get started on some of the mess that people consider to be classics, so I won't hate on Alicia. I will say however, that there was much to be said about her originality despite a direct Prince cover (which she did poorly!), a sample of James Brown, a song Brian McKnight sang on an episode of ""Martin"" and must I really mention that strange thing she did with ""Moonlight Sonata""?There were some good things about it- try ""Rock With You"" and ""Goodbye"" and skip ""Mr. Man"" and you should be happy. I am much more impressed by the sophomore effort. She definitely developed a distinct style and creativity during her hiatus and at this rate she'll continue to make good music."
2,Potential but lacking in substance....,"This is just an okay CD. Her vocals are weak, the girl's got talent but her voice needs to mature. She lacks a depth in her vocal sound and lyrics... granted she's 19, but India Arie knocks her out the box on both counts (as does Ms. Jill Scott). She should really emphasize her piano talents, she bangs pure beauty out of those keys! But because she sings on every track, this CD is out of rotation on my player."
5,So Much Talent & Passion..All About Alicia Keys,"I have never in my life been into a cd like this... Alicia Keys has a style of her own... Pure raw talent... For someone who is 19 years old, She has accomplished so much. Creates and Writes her own music, Arranges, Directs her videos and songs, does the vocals and background and also plays the piano beautifully... This is a woman that's going to be on her way to the top. With the mix of Jazz and Blues and then to top it off with r&b, it shows that all of her music comes straight from the heart and soul of her being.This has to be the best ever! I know that Alicia has only just begun. I listen to this everyday and my daughter who's 3 1/2 even knows when Alicia is on.. She loves it as much as I do. It's relaxing and soul searching..My Favorites....1. Caged Bird2. Alicia and the piano3. Mr. Man4. Butterflies5. Jane Doe6. A Woman's Worth"
2,Its all in the marketing,"I was disappointed after I brought this CD! It is wonderful to see a musician play his or her own music, this is probably the reason why so many of us were drawn to the musicianship of D'Angelo. However, Alicia was marketed extremely well by Clive Davis. This is evident by her FIVE Grammy's. Placing her in the same position as Lauren Hill....and there is no comparison. She could be gifted...however she lacks depth and range. A pretty face and and an extremely wealthy man can get you a grammy too! I think it is an outrage that true singers such as Jill Scott, India Arie and Amel Laurrieux are constantly placed on back burners because they don't have a certain look. Maybe we need to get more commoners involved in the grammy selection process or award those artist truly deserving of the trophy."
2,Not grammy worthy,"I finally capitulated and got this Alicia Keys CD just to see if it was as good as a lot of people claimed. And, I should've followed my instinct because I was VERY disappointed. From the intro, of ""Piano and I"", which Alicia talks her way over the beginning of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, I knew that this was going to go disastrous. Aside from her radio-played ""Fallin'"", and ""A Woman's Worth"", Alicia Keys' songwriting, and vocally weak whiny voice really just did not cut it for me. I loved both India Arie's and Nelly Furtado's debut CD's, and either deserved more Grammy wins than Alicia Keys. If you're looking for originality, true vocal talent, and a CD you just won't listen to for two songs, then try Nelly Furtado's ""Whoa Nelly"", India Arie's ""Acoustic Soul"" or one of my favorites of all time, Lauryn Hill's ""Miseducation of Lauryn Hill."""
1,Not great at all,"What can I say, I bought the album and I own it about a year now and listend to it many times but still I dont understand what so speacial about the album. All the songs are quite boring and not interesting except the singles released and for 'x-girlfriend'. I bought because it said it won Grammy's and this album is for Grammy's, wow Grammys should be named awards for dull albums. Alicia Keys voice is alos a bit weak, thin and less soulful than what they promote it to be. Songwriting, I think it is the worst part of the album, the good songs are those songs that she only co-wrote and songs she has written are quite bland in this album.I dont recommend this album."
2,im a alicia keys fan,"im a alicia keys fan but im tired of her music. all the ppl talks about alicia keys. ppl is to busy paying attention to alicia keys, thats why other artist like sunshine anderson, res, india arie, olivia, toya and many more dont have the chances to show all the ppl there talent. i think alicia keys is a very lucky girl. but she is not the best soul rnb singer out there of this mouments . she got a beatfull voice and she plays the piano very good. what she did is take a beatifull song like fallin as a first single(now i hate it), if she have taken a woman worth as first single, i bet her cd wonted debut at no.1. i think she will not take the grammy 4 best new artist.(my opinion)"
2,"Not much else but ""Falling""","If you are looking to buy this CD becuase you heard ""falling"" and think that there is more to hear. You will be disappointed. Although I think Alicia is an amazing young woman who has worked very hard to get to where she is, I found the rest of the songs on the CD uninteresting. The lyrics were amatuer. THe music uninspiring. I still think Alicia has incredible potention, but maybe she should stick to the time tested approach of letting others do the writing and composing."
2,Hype In A Minor,"Alicia Keys is all hype. I'm saying it bluntly, she is pure and total hype. Her album isn't some sort of earth shattering debut release, as many have believed. It's just some girl playing the piano averagely and singing middle of the road R&B music. The smash hit album contains two top 10 singles, the overplayed ""Fallin'"" and ""A Woman's Worth"", and a poorly performed Prince cover in ""How Come You Don't Call Me?"" which failed to make it into the top 40. All three tunes are overblown and boring. Nothing spectacular there. The whole album is very common and dull. It's just very boring. I do like a handful of songs, ""Girlfriend"", ""Troubles"", and ""Jane Doe"". The rest I really just don't find to be enjoyable in the least. Very standard ballad by numbers work. Sorry, Alicia, but you'll really have to try harder to live up to all that hype, other wise, you can kindly tickle your ivories in someone else's ears."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"I didn't feel this CD. Wait, I know - everybody told me that I'm supposed to feel it. Oprah, MTV, TRL, radio stations, et cetera. Unfortunately, when I bought it and listened - I didn't feel it. Alicia Keys is one of the most talented pianists I have ever heard. A shame that she doesn't really play anything on this CD. Instead we get typical beats that can found on any R&B CD and a 19 year-old who clearly needs a few minutes of quality time with a bar of soap in her mouth. Save your money. If you're that pressed to hear Alicia, send me an email. You can have my copy for free."
4,Great debut from a talented young lady!,"Alicia has the potential to be a legend in the making. At only 19 years old she writes and produces one of the best songs of the last couple of years ""Fallin"". Other stand-outs are A woman's worth, the Prince-rendition ""How come you don't call me"", the great The life, Goodbye, Why do I feel so sad and caged bird. She still lacks somethings and the songs somewhat blends together and become a little bit boring sometimes. But I have no doubt that she will grow as an artist and in the future deliver a more brilliant album than this."
3,"Beautiful, yes she is...and extremely talented, but...","you can hardly tell it on this over-processed CD!!! I don't know if anyone saw her performance on the NYC Tribute, but she was definitely at her best...just her and her piano! Maybe she needs to find a new producer..."
3,Overrated,"Oh well, I got this album late and I think it is quite overrated.I think part of the success is due to the way that radio and television promotes her songs from day to night, just like what they're doing with britney spears now.I think some of the songs are ok, but not that awesome, highly overrated."
2,CD is Uneven,"I ran out and ordered this cd after seeing the performances on a couple of the big Music Award shows. The few songs that have been getting the most radio play are the best ones on the cd. The other songs are a bit dull. I bought this cd and Aaliyah's at the same time, but I play Aailyah's CD out and I haven't played this one again since I first bought it."
4,This cd keeps fallin into the stereo!,Alicia Keys u go girl!Finally a artist who writes and plays there own instruments!SHe has major talent this cd is awesome it puts other artist to shame after hearing this .You can tell she feels her songs there all really good.Shes not singing about how in love she is with a boy or a crush shes singing from the heart. This is the only cd my PARENTS and I BOTH enjoy. My top favorites-Fallin-the best tops.2-the life-cool.3.caged bird-love it!4.why dont u call me5.girlfriend-great.6.y do i feel so sad-i cry every time i hear this.ANd all the other tracks are great to.
4,Good for a first album,"Alica Keys debut album shows off her wonderful voice as well as her skills on the keyboards. I was waiting for this release with baited breath because I felt a true void in the R& B genre. I think that Ms. Keys could easily hold her own with the new R&B queens like Jill Scott and Erikah Badu in time, but For now I thought the album was lacking a little depth and didn't quite live up to all of it's hype. That being said, I look forward to more from Alica."
1,Fallin' . . . fast,"I bought this because of the soung Fallin', but I was greatly disappointed with the rest of it. It just drones on and on, and I was surprised and disappointed with her ""potty mouth.""One hit wonder."
2,Overrated Album of the Year,"No doubt, she's she can play the piano, she can carry a tune, and she's pretty, but that's it. She's not as great as the media will have you believe. I adored 'Fallin' until it got overplayed. After awhile, I realized it reminds me of another song. Can't seem to put my finger on which one.I wanted to get the CD so I listened to my friend's first and boy, was I disappointed. It's quite a half-arsed effort although I do like 'Jane Doe.' I can't believe she did better than India Arie but that's the Grammy's for you (remember how Britney was nominated *cringe*)! I fully agree with an earlier review. If you want something brilliant, get Tori Amos' debut 'Little Earthquakes' or just stick with your radio. They're bound to overplay her anyway."
5,Soulful Sister Beyond Her Years,"First, let me commend Alicia Keys for having the ability to write her own material and the talent to sing and play the piano better than most others in the music industry. In this industry where everyone seems to just be a product of their record company with no presence or minds of their own, Alicia Keys is a very refreshing change. Her amazing soul comes through every track on her album and anyone can tell that this woman is wise beyond her years. Even now, after her cd has been out for awhile, I love to sit back after a day of work and listen to it because it is very soothing. Those who seem to think her cd is ""over-hyped"" do not understand the deeper soul behind singers such as Alicia Keys, India Arie, Floetry, and Jill Scott. Being a singer and piano player myself, Alicia Keys is truly an inspiration to me. I look forward to the future of Miss Keys, one of the best things out there."
2,Only one good song....,"Yeah, the only good song is ""Fallin'""...i tried to listed to the whole cd, but none of the other songs have the same kind of beat as Fallin'..it just lags off...Alicia Keys has a great voice, there's no doubt about that, but if I had known the rest of the cd would (stink), i would have just bought the single and not the whole album...""Fallin'"" has such a great melody and Alicia's voice just rocks, but the rest of the album just (stinks)."
5,WOW!!,"I must say, this girl is talented. She is wonderful in the work that she does. I like the fact that she writes, produce and make her own music. Her songs are unique and is smooth. This is one cd I can pop in and acutually enjoy the WHOLE cd. It calm my nerves, also at the same time it's something you can groove to. This cd is hot for the summer and I highly suggest it for your collection. It's jazzy wit a bit of Hip hop...but more jazzy. I love her songs ""Goodbye"", ""Caged Bird"". Just a few of the slow james on here cd. Woman's worth is alsome. GET OUT AND GET IT...IT'S WORTH IT AND MORE..........."
1,Overrated and ALL hype,"WOW she can play the piano! Not only is this album not good but its REAL bad. This is supposed to be something special? Well it isnt. The only reason [people] bought this album is because of marketing. Every song on here is no lyrical masterpiece like they made it out to be. Its all bland, repetitive, cliched music. If you want someone who plays the piano and actually has substance to the music listen to Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel. They are actually artists."
1,not 4 serious soul music diggaz,"there's nothing special about alicia keys and this album. but i'm not amazed that there's a lot of people gave this album 4-5 stars, fans of destiny's child, usher, brian mc knight and the likes,...will definetely dig this album, but if you're a serious soul music lovers, u wont put it in your cd changer again after one listen 2 the whole album. alicia keys can stand among new artist like sunshine anderson,or maybe...india arie, but there's no way 2 compare her on this album with the ""head of the class""miss erykah badu 4 90's generation,or further more...minnie riperton.they're some of the true lady soul that's really happening. anyway,4 serous soul music listeners,you can still enjoy her cover of prince's:how come u don't call me""but that is it 4 me.all the other tracks is no different than ordinary r&b tracks that u can hear 20 times a day on the radio."
1,PLEASE READ THIS,"Words cannot express how TERRIBLE this album is. I cant believe that they would give her 5 grammy for something that sounds so terrible. I will admit that she has a good voice and she can play a few instruments but that doesnt mean everything. She needs to sing backup for someone with a more powerful voice or play in a band somewhere. If I could have given her a 0 star rating I would. And I HATE how my girl INDIA got CHEATED out of her award(s). She has a great voice, great lyrics and she sounds GREAT singing them. Also she doesnt have to cake on make-up and dark eyeshadow to look like a raccoon, she is a BEAUTIFUL sista."
2,This girl CAN'T SING!!!,"Alicia must be getting so much attention because of her age and her songwriting abilities, because it definitely ain't for her voice. I'm sorry, I'd rather listen to chalk being dragged across a blackboard. There is nothing captivating or intriguing about her weak, off-key voice.And the songs sound like retreads of early Stevie Wonder, but without the soul or the rhythm. What's the big deal?"
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Keys is a beautiful, talented young lady, however I don't think that her first effort was all that great and definitely didn't deserve five Grammys. The A minor aspect throughout the CD was boring and aggravating. On a positive note, the songs seemed to be heartfelt."
4,keeps you begging for more...,"all i kept hearing about this cd before i bought it was that it wasn't the greatest but it was definitely good. that didn't help much. and personally, i really don't like the prince cover she did on here. but ""fallin"", ""rock wit u"", and ""butterflyz"" are some of the best soul songs i've ever heard. and from the beginning of the album, where she mixes her hip hop style with a classical riff, shows you how creative she can be. if you are looking for the perfect cd to complement your ""i want to chill after my worst day ever"" mood, this is the cd of the moment. and i can't wait to see what her next album will be like. i'm sure it will be even better."
2,Not as good as i thought,"Alicia Keys, beautiful, talented, but lacks something? this album was a real disappointment to me. The only good songs i found were girlfriend and fallin'. But even with those songs the radio just killed it by playing fallin' to freakin much! I can't believe it was even nominated for an award even won! If you really want music go try other new artists like Amerie or jill scott. Now there's music! I'm not saying Alicia Keys is untalented just or sucks, just it isn't my style of music."
2,It's so easy to earn 5 stars...,"Yes! she's beautiful, Yes! she can sing well, Yes! she can sort of play the piano.Congratulations! you've got yourself a record deal and thousands of adoring fans. Ah, so what if there's no real depth, no real love for music, but more love for fame and adoration. People will give you 5 stars and you'll win a grammy, but so will Ashanti, and so did Millie Vanillie, and who cares! Get rich off your mediocre and undeveloped musical skills.Miss Keys, you could have been great! you could have made them cry with your sweet voice and your instrument, but you chose the road most often traveled.Congratulations on your grammy!"
2,There's better out there!,"I think the highly overplayed song ""Fallin'"" is OK, the first time you listen to it. Just because Alicia can play the piano and makes her own music doesn't mean we all should applaud, kick scream and hand her grammies. There are many other artists who make their own music and play an instrument and are MUCH better than Alicia. (*INDIA ARIE in particular!)People might think she thugs it up a little to much, but an artist's style is his/her own artistic work. Not for me though> She has a little soul, but personally , if you buy this CD, youll be fallin out of love with alicia very fast."
2,"Folks, this is NOT ground-breaking!","Everyone is acting like they've never seen a songwriter/pianist before! How about Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Carol King, Billy Joel etc. I'm not a hater, I just don't see what the big deal is. Most of the music consists of little more than two chords, and the lyrics are mostly cookie-cutter R&B cliches."
2,Too Much Hype! (She's no pianist!),"The key of ""A minor"" can be a sumptious key on the piano. However, it is also the ""key"" used to describe a novice playing the white notes on the keyboard. This CD represents the latter. Boring repetitous 2 chord arrangements featuring adolescent lyrics. (The background vocals tracks are very nice at times, however, though this is not much of a consolation.) This music would never make it without the all the...hype and video air time. PS: To Amazon.com - how about some equal time - please publish this review."
4,I love her but the album is .............ok,I love alicia keys as a person i thought fallin was great but the album is ok.She does have a powerful voice. But she is a real musician sings plays writes produces.I think the album is lacking something . Too many slow midtempo songs and i think she is realeasing poor songs to make sucessful single i think girlfriend jane doe troubles rock wit u goodbye would make a great single. She can definetly play the piano.the highlights are...girlfriendfallintroublesa womans worthrock wit ujane doegoodbyethe lifebutterfliesI think she is a great artist tho. and she derserves all those grammys.but her india arie derserved something she is also a fantastic artist.
5,exquisitely beautiful.,"If you don't appreciate music by people who have beautiful voices than this ones not for you. ...BR>I fell in love with Alicia's song lyrics, vocal abilities, AND her amazing ability to play the piano.Most popular artists (among the divas) are not too in touch with their instruments... and a piano, can truly become a major element in making something sound exquisite!Now, I don't know what was wrong with the reviewer above me. It sounds like he never listened to the ENTIRE CD before, because... he overlooked the uplifting ""Piano and I"" intro (The very first song on the CD. This song is awesome, and I was sad when my CD player could not play it anymore, because I had had it on repeat for two weeks.I gave it a 5 for all around perfection!Keep it up Keys!"
4,Tha talent part4,"Yo zach, i got this album and is is turly talent and a tight album, and to say that about a new artist, you are completey wrong and if you had musical talent, you would not want anybody to put down you stuff, so don't put down my girl!"
2,Alicia is talented but way overhyped,"Alicia keys is way overhyped. She has a decent voice and she is a very talented pianist, but there is hardly any substance to her music. "" fallin"" is a great worthy single, but many of the other songs, aren't as enjoyable ( with the exception of girlfriend). I am dissapointed because I expected this to be a great Cd, but instead I should have just bought the ""fallin"" single.I, really don't see the big deal about Alicia, there are many artists out there who are more talented than her but aren't experiencing the same kind of fame. Everyone has different musical taste's and maybe you will like it, but I just didn't find this album to be very tasty."
5,Amazing Cd,Hi! i have seen alicia keys and in my heart i am saying that she has too much talent and she is so serious about her job not like others who take it as a game. I congrat her for this cd and i hope that everyone would take her serious as much as i do ! god bless You
2,Should have saved my money,"I bought this CD on a whim having listened to a couple of the tracks at a listening booth in Virgin Records. While those snippets sounded promising, I got pretty bored with the album when I sat down to listen to the whole thing. Admittedly I'm not a big R&B fan but this album certainly didn't make me much more of a fan."
5,Innovative!,"With the plethora of misogynistic hip hop tunes innundating the radio waves, it is refreshing to hear music that is backed by such a real talent. Alicia Keyes succeeds at mixing her classical piano training along with the obvious influences of artists such as Aretha Franklin and R. Kelly that are present on her debut album. She begins the LP with a somber piano introduction and then drops a baseline that picks up the tempo. My top picks off the album, besides 'Fallen' which is dominating the airwaves right now, are the R Kelly-ish 'Woman' Worth', the Prince inspired 'How Come You Don't Call Me', 'Goodbye', an ode to the broken-hearted and 'Butterflyz' for all the lovebirds. I guarantee that Songs in A Minor is a CD you will listen to from beginning to end, without interruption."
3,TOO HYPED!!,"I respect Alicia's skills, but people hyped this album up a little 2 much. When I heard the album my expectations where too high, and I was little disappointed. Her style does not just stand out, like she is Stevie Wonder's daughter or something. I gave the CD 3 stars, because it is a good album, but the media and other people is giving this album too much credit. Buy JILL SCOTT's CD, now that CD is underrated."
2,"OK CD, way overrated","Songs in A Minor, Alicia Keys' debut CD is OK, but is way overrated. Just beacuse unlike Britney Spears and other pop artists she is talented, writes her own music and is a is good at the piano and writing her songs, doens't mean we should give her all of this attenton. But she is getting way too much attention. She didn't deserve 5 grammys, more like one or two. India Arie deserved grammys. Her album is ok for a debut album. Fallin' and A Woman's Worth are the only good songs on this CD. Don't waste your money on this CD. Just turn on your radio and you'll hear her songs."
2,Terrible. Enough Said.,"I really liked ""Fallin"" and I thought that rest of her CD would be just a good. Believe me it's not. All the songs are so meaning less. ""A Woman's Worth"" is one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard. What everybody sees in Alicia Keys I will never figure out. The only reason why I gave it two stars is because ""Fallin"" is such a [great] song. A word of advice to Alicia: Write better music and have other instruments besides that damn piano!"
1,Over-hyped cd not for everyone,"I was so disappointed in this cd. First of all, I bought it after hearing only one song (""fallin"")which was a mistake and something that I usually don't do. But everyone was going on and on about this incredible cd so I bought it. The other songs come nowhere near the bluesy soul that ""fallin"" does, not even close. They are more hip-hop and competely different in sound and not to my taste. I found the bass line to be overwhelming on most of the songs to the point of being hard on the ears and I thought it was needless and low-class for her to curse like she does. I'm not going to play that with my small kids in the room and I think it's a shame she felt the need to do that. She definitely has some talent there that needs honing but I would wait for some other songs to get airplay before spending your money on this. If the other songs suit you, then fine. Otherwise stick to the single for ""fallin"" and hope she develops her sound in that direction."
4,Alicia Keys- You have arrived,"I first fell in love with this artist, when I heard the cut titled ""Fallin"". It reminds me of James Brown with a new twist. After listening to the entire cd and encouraging other co workers to purchase it I have grown increasing fond of the all the cuts on this cd. This young lady is very talented and I hope to hear from her in the future."
5,I agree with reviewer Steve Baskin,"I don't normally buy this type of music and rarely listen to the radio stations that play it, but when I heard this album with friends (and I only listened to the album twice!) I was hooked! In a word ""Phenomenal!!"" My favorites are ""Mr. Man"" and ""Jane Doe"" but ALL the cuts are hits!! She has talent beyond her years! You go, Girl!"
2,A future star...,"Like many, I was drawn to this album by the single, ""Fallin'"". I didn't expect every track to reach that standard but was disappointed to find that the others fell far short. Alicia Keys is undoubtedly a talent as a singer and a pianist. As a songwriter she is still immature. I look forward to watching her talent find its expression in much better songs as she grows and matures. At 20, it's tough to write, sing, play piano and produce. She could use some help in the songwriting department, and some adult supervision in the production department. Every track has unnecessary and often irritating production elements, which detract from the reasons to buy an Alicia Keys album - her voice and piano skills."
3,Good but could have been better,"Now I appreciate the type of music Alicia Keys has on Songs in A Minor, but this album is not that great. Fallin, A woman's Worth, Girlfriend and The Life are the only catchy, radio-friendly hits on here, everything else is simply plain and boring with no soul in it. I'm happy she won Grammys, but she did NOT deserve 5 of them, and I still don't understand how she beat out Aaliyah, because Aaliyah's album should have won instead. And India Arie could have gotten at least 1 or 2 of them. Hopefully on her next album she'll be able to dosomething more innovative and creative, but for now she is no beethoven or aretha"
4,Not bad for a debut...,"I love listening to the compositions for this CD's tracks, particularly the ones where it's just Alicia and her piano.I couldn't relate to her lyrics because I am older (the reason for the four stars), but I definitely appreciate her music.I am looking forward to her second project."
3,shiny future,"True. The girl sits down, cracks the knuckles, and plays the piano. Problem is, just because someone can sit down, crack knuckles and bang on the ivory doesn't make them a musical revelation. Listening closely, she plays the piano about as well as my two brothers did. In middle school. Complexity is not the word that rushes to mind.I'm not as hard on her as some of the others though. Her voice is good. Not great, but who cares? Irma Thomas has the voice next door. Etta James chewed gravel. Point being, soul doesn't equal off the range high notes. See Patti LaBelle. Patti LaBelle singing the National Anthem is like putting my manhood in a vice. Alicia takes her time. She sings pretty. Especially on Fallin', Why Do I Feel So Sad, and the bonus track.Aside from the basic piano, and the ok singing, this album lacks."
4,Impressive Debut,"At the outset, I must admit that while I had heard Fallin on the radio lots of times, I had never given Alicia Keys much of a listen until after I saw her perform on the WTC September 11th Telethon on TV. I was really impressed by her performance on that show and bought Songs in A Minor shortly thereafter.Now that I've listened to this album, I know what all the buzz is about. Frankly, I like Fallin but don't think it is the best song on the CD. The song selection on the CD showcases Keys in a fairly broad range of musical styles and this keeps the album fun and interesting to listen to. Still, her strong voice, which grows on you each listen, wraps up the varied styles into one sound. My personal favorites on the CD are A Women's Worth, Mr. Man, and Piano & 1.A terrific debut by a young singer who has tremendous upside as she matures. Buy it and play it for your friends!"
1,Overhyped and overrated!,"Sure she is very beautiful, but that's about it! Just because she can play the piano and sing okay doesn't mean she's the next Stevie Wonder. She really did not deserve all the 5 five grammys that she won. India Arie, who truly is a talented artist, got robed!There are just a few good tracks on Songs in A minor and the rest is filler. For the next album; I really hope that she focuses on more uplifting songs and she takes vocallessons."
2,"Beautiful Girl, Beautiful voice, but too few beautiful songs","I can't get ""Fallin"" out of my heard; it's hauntingly beautiful. But I am afraid that the rest of this CD is mostly annoying. Songs like ""Butterflyz"" and the bomus track, ""Loving U"" come closest to meeting the expectations heightened by ""Fallin',"" but it's a pity that listeners must put up with ""Piano and I"" and ""Girlfriend"" and ""Jane Doe"" and a few of the other songs to enjoy those few."
2,"great voice, sleepy material","After listening to this cd, I have to admit that Alicia Keys has a great voice. The problem is the songs. They're mostly dull and sound the same. The only good tracks in my opinion are: Falling, How Come U don't Call me anymore, Never Felt this way, and Girlfriend. Hope next time she does better."
2,This is a one song album,"And by that I don't mean ""Fallin'."" The best song by far on this CD is ""How Come You Don't Call Me Anymore."" Alicia sounds AMAZING in this song. It should definitely be her next single. ""Fallin'"" is also a good song, my second favorite one, but it doesn't even compare to ""How Come . . "" I just wish every song were like these two. The rest is a boring parade of basic, uninteresting R & B. ""A Woman's Worth"" isn't bad, but the CD just seems to drone on and on. Alicia, honey, you played beautifully at the Grammy's, I just wish your songs were as good as your piano playing."
3,too much hype,"Great voice, nice tunes, but over rated. She is a good artist to be sure in a sea of mediocre to bad Neo Soul wannabes. But I I heard any cut of this album one more time or another columnist drool over the over hyped Ms. Keys I think I would break this CD in half. Liked it, but this is not the second coming of Marvin Gaye or as earth shattering a musical event as Thriller. Its a good CD that Clive Davis expertly marketed. Two thumbs up for a legit artist with an pretty nice album."
4,A Style of Her Own,"This CD presents an artist who has her own kind of style. Throughout the entire CD, Alicia Key's beautiful voice flows harmonicly along with her talant on the piano. This is presented again, but in a slightly different way, on her latest CD, 'The Diary of Alicia Keys'."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"When I first got this CD, I thought that there would be only one song that I would like (Fallin'). After I started listening to a few of them, though, I changed my mind. I'm not that much into rap, so I didn't like 'Piano and I', but 'Fallin'', 'A Woman's Worth', 'Girlfriend', and others prove that Alicia Keys doesn't only have a wonderful voice, but that she's also very talented at writing lyrics and plays the piano really well.If you like R&B and Soul music, I really recommend this CD."
3,okay,"let me start by saying that alicia keys has a very strong, phenomenal voice. nevertheless, her debut cd is very unimpressive. her writing and production need A LOT of work. her talent vocally and as a pianist are almost totally obliterated by the poor, amateurish quality of the writing. with the exception of ""girlfriend,"" the ""never felt this way"" interlude, and ""butterflyz,"" the songs are pretty un-engaging. the beats come in really well initially, but the writing lacks so much luster that you eventually lose interest in the beats, her voice, AND what she's saying. i don't know. ""songs in a minor"" isn't horrible, it's just not interesting. i'm not giving up hope on her, though. hopefully, alicia's writing skills and production will mature with time, because she has an incredible amount of talent to work with. until then, however, i highly recommend that you give this cd a complete listen BEFORE you buy it. she's already platinum...if you listen first, she'll be alright."
3,Smooth Luck Artist,"Alicia Keys ""Song in a Minor"" was a very well planned and thought out album, she express certain views from the heart but in the long run this album was over rated and the reason why is that out of all her songs, four to five of them you can actually listen to on a regular basis but this album alone was carried along by luck but if she rushes her success on another album it may become a flop like Sisqo's from Dru Hill."
2,"overarranged, underwhelming","The arrangements and backing music totally destroy whatever melody Miss Keys' voice carries. I like the first single Fallin, but even that song is overloaded and overwhelmed by overblown arrangements.Miss Keys, next time you record an album, tell your producers to give you some breathing room -- you (and your listeners) need it."
3,Alicia is one blessed young woman...,"This CD can get a bit repetitive(some of the songs are very similar), BUT I think it's great start for a gifted young artist like Ms. Keys-seriously, what the heck were the rest of us doing at 19? This is a young lady that girls can actually look up to-she is an accomplished pianist, talented singer and songwriter, and is gorgeous without feeling the need to rip her clothes off onstage to prove this obvious point like the rest of her musical peers. I think Ms. Keys has a long career ahead of her and her class act is a breath of fresh air in this pop-saturated music scene...."
5,the next big star,"Alicia Keys has arrived on the scene and I believe she will be here for a long time. Like the Editor's review stated Alicia Keys is a very refreshing new talent. Finally we have a cd that isn't centered around booty shaking music. This girl can flat out sing.The first single ""fallen"" showcases what to expect on this albumn. The Jermaine Dupri laced single ""Girlfriend"" should be the next single to drop. I must say that although ""Never felt this way"" is an interlude it is my favorite. The song showcases her beautiful voice backed by a simple piano.Please Please Don't sleep on this albumn!!"
5,A MasterPiece,"An old soul singing out of such a young body. The fusion of such styles is wonderful, I greatly appreciate Alicia Keys. Notable songs: Troubles and A Woman's Worth."
2,Very disappointed in this CD,"I watched Alicia Keys on a recent Oprah show and I was so excited to get her new CD that I pre-ordered it. I was hoping for a soul/classical album. What a disappointment!Alicia has a beautiful voice, but Songs in A Minor was a huge disappointment to me. Perhaps I was expecting something that the album wasn't (unique, classical with soul)."
1,Trendy Pop Trash,"This CD is nothing like the single Fallen. There's a lot of hype about Alicia Keys because she's ""a classically trained artist"" but don't let it fool you. I was looking for a new sound and this CD is not it. The songs sound like all the other songs on the radio,talking about the same things. Without the piano, which isn't prominent on the majority of songs, Alicia's voice doesn't even sound very good. I hope her 15 minutes are up soon. Download it if you want it, but don't waste your money."
3,lovely singer,i like the three songs that i got to listen to but i wish i could listen to the whole cd but yall got it block off so i could only listen to the three but i know that the whole cd has to be tight becasue she can sing
3,songs in A minor,"i haven't really heard this cd, but what i have heard i like that is why i gave it a three. the song ""fallin"" is my all time favorite song, because i can relate to it very well. i think that Alicia Keys is a very good artist and i hope that her career takes her very far in life."
1,"Shut up, I'm about to break!!!","I'm very unhappy with this CD; Alicia Keys clearly doesn't have musical talent. Alicia only has really one hit Single, ""Fallin'"", and that is like, the only decent song on the whole album. When I first heard, ""Fallin"", I knew this artist had talent, then I herd the rest of the album and knew I made a mistake buying this. The tracks that really suck are ""Piano and I"", ""Mr. Man"", ""Why Do I Feel so Sad"", and ""A Women's Worth"" which are not well written but also remind me of getting shot in the leg."
1,i keep on falling in and out of ...................... sleep,"this album by far is the worst album i ever heard! in fact this cd makes britney spears ""britney"" look like ""like a virgin"". this girl alica cook(her real name) only knows 5 grade piano! me and my sister both took piano all through elemtary so basically alicia has gotten famous off of basic stuff. it doesn't take alot of work or skill for that matter to pull of ""fur ellis"" in concert. alicia doesn't know what's a head in the music industry for her. i may not be in the spotlight,but i sure as hell have seen MANY singers and bands crash and burn and fade away from exists! alicia is on this path. all the subject matter in the songs are nearly the same in each song all the piano is the same as well.elton john and the piano man billy joel can play piano BEYOND 5 grade level.if you want REAL pinao work get elton john's new cd!otherwise your stuck with a coaster if you buy this one!"
2,"Just a lot of hype--not bad, not good.","Alicia may play the piano, and may look nice while playing the piano, but this CD just didn't do it for me. I returned it to be honest. Her music sounds dated and generic. ""Fallin"" is as good as it gets here. With all the praise this girl has gotten you'd think this CD was Lauryn Hill's ""Miseducation..."" Not even close. Alicia has a decent voice, but something is missing. I don't hear a lot of soul. I believed Prince when he asked ""How come you don't call me anymore?"" I don't believe Alicia. And her use of Marvin Gaye's ""Inner City Blues"" was done in a lazy fashion--she just sings over his melody. How creative is that? If you want to really hear someone who took risks and stretches the notion of today's R&B music, check out Aaliyah's new CD. Her voice is smaller, but you'll feel what she sings....sometimes that's all you need."
2,"""A Musician first""? - Give me a break!","The key of ""A minor"" can be a sumptuous key on the piano. However, it is also ""the key"" often labelled when a total novice places their fingers on the white keys and attempts to compose music. To say that this recording artist is ""a musician first"" is to ignore the attractive cleavage and firm tummy on the cover photo of the CD. While I suppose that it may be noteworthy to have a singer ""play"" an instrument these days, don't buy this expecting to hear any real keyboard work! Eye candy, certainly! But she ought not be confused with any real musician/singers/composers with actual talent, like Patrice Russian. Sorry, but I can't buy into the hype on this one."
3,Song in A Minor,"Alicia Keys is very talented but I'm not feeling her whole album. I skip through majority of her songs on the album. She has a great voice and an outstanding pianist, although. The album is to depressing. Maybe if she song more uplifting songs, I would enjoy it more. Jill Scott and Indie Arie album is a little better. But she truly gifted."
5,Beautiful and Talented,"This has to be one of the best CDs I have bought in a very long time. Alicia has a beautiful voice, and she's very talented. Although a lot of her songs have sorrowful melodies and/or lyrics, they are so beautifully sung - I definately recommend this CD. It is not a waste of money! My favorites are ""Fallin'"", ""Troubles"" and ""Goodbye"", but all the songs on this CD are great!"
1,boring boring boring,alicia takes a great prince classic and kills it -so what if she can play a few classical tunes on the piano .lacks real soul .
1,Most Overrated CD of the Year!,"With all the hype around Alicia Keys, I expected to hear some amazing music on this CD. Not so. Trust me... it never gets any better than the overplayed ""Fallin'.""Don't waste your money on this overhyped, BORING CD!"
1,It Aint All That,Alicia Keys did not deserve 5 grammy's. This album isn't not what everyone hyped it up to be. It sounds more like pop then neo-soul. She is clearly overrated.
3,butterflyz,"I did not want to buy this cd at first because I believed that the world didn't need another neo-soul, pretentious artist. I still feel that way about Alicia Keys, but with a little help she can be soulful without being pretentious. Stevie and Hathaway weren't pretentious at all! The song that is put together the best on this CD is butterflyz. The breakdown is genius...even though she is saying simple words- ""you and I are destiny, i know now you were made for me."" The way it is arranged is a delight! I can't get passed it, i keep rewinding and rewinding that part. More stuff like that on the next album Alicia Keys, and then I can align you with the Hathaways and the Stevies. Until then..."
4,"Beautiful, but not absolutely incredible","This album is an AMAZING start for such a young talent, true, but she doesn't need ALL the HYPE. I ran out to buy this CD after melting every time I heard ""Fallin,"" but unfortunately the whole CD does not uphold the beauty of that radio ballad. There are only about 4 other tracks including both creative vocal dynamics and phat beats to mix up her classical piano. Several of the other ballads are boring as hell, simply a nice voice and piano accompaniment; though she does make it work beautifully with ""Caged Bird"". The other get your groove on tracks just barely make me move, but ""Girlfriend"" ""Jane Doe"" and ""Mr. Man"" are unique and flow well. I do still recommend getting it, the good tracks are truly EXCELLENT."
5,New Diva,"""Piano and Me"" is one of the best opening songs on an album this year along with ""We Need A Resolution"" by Aaliyah. It shows Alicia Keys has the versatility and talent to make her mark on the music industry. Ive bought multiple copies of the cd and given it as gifts its so good. You can listen to it all the way through and wont be disappointed. Get this one!"
