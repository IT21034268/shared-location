1,Bad Choice,The item did not work and since you can't find it anywhere in stores I have to now go without
1,Not A Good Buy!,"I bought this item for Christmas '06 and I am already having problems with it! The picture quality is very poor! Also, I've had difficulty finding many of the PVD's which it uses. I would not recommend this product!"
1,horrible!,This is the biggest piece of poop I have ever seen! You would go broke buying $13 discs that you would only watch once or twice. Don't rip yourself off when at some places the shows are more expensive than the actual system!!!!
1,TOTAL PEICE OF CRAP!!!,THIS STUPID LOOKING THING SUCKS! IT FREEZES AND SCREEN TURNS BLACK OOH DID I MENTION HOW STUPID IT LOOKS BUY A NINTENDO DS THIS IS JUST A CHEEP PEICE OF TRASH THAT DOSENT WORK. OOH DID I MENTION HOW STUPID IT LOOKS:)
3,1st one didn't work,"We received the first one in time for Christmas, but the Granddaughter upon opening couldn't get it to play. Neither could any of the grownups. So we had to return it in exchange for another one which arrived well into the 1st of the year. The second one played well and had a good pictue quality."
1,IT STINKS DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,so whatis the deal with the xp the only diffrince is it folds Wow!!! Besides the screan is fussy and it hurts yore eyes!!!! so dont get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (oh yea i wanted to put 0 STARS!!!!!)
1,GIVE IT UP VIDEONOW!!!!,"There's absolutely no reason for kids to get this.If kids bought all the craploads of VideoNow color discs,theres no need to buy a more expensive model that only lets you hold it in a different way (oooooo,wow!) and a has a (finally) BIGGER SCREEN!! But since I'm a Nintendo fanboy, whenever Nintendo does this, like releasing the GBA SP or DS Lite, I swallow it like candles and buy it immediately. I even bought a Micro for God's sake!Its like ripping a big hole in your parents' wallet for a bigger carrot,but you already have 1,000 other carrots so its kinda pointless......Lets stick with portable DVD players..."
4,Simply Relaxing ...,This is one of the best albums I have come across in a long time.When I say one of the best in a long time means I totally like all the songs in this album. This is one of those albums that you can leave on your player and listen to for a long time even if it plays over and over again.The lyrics are heart warming and the voice of Jodie Brooke Wilson is simply perfect for all the songs. Her voice is like a breath of fresh air that relaxes you while you're listening to it.
3,A good but not perfect Pilcher outing,"If you have never read Rosamunde Pilcher, start with Coming Home or The Shell Seekers or even the recent Winter Solstice. All are great representives of Pilcher's unique character-driven novels. This one, though fine, is too short in length as well as in character detail. It is a fine little ""Pilcher fix"", if you are a fan."
3,"Easy reading, but not one of Rosemunde Pilcher's best.","""The End of Summer"" was true to the Rosemunde Pilcher formula: conflicted heroine torn between two men. It was easy reading, predictable, but lacked the depth and character development of ""Coming Home"" and ""The Shell Seekers."" If you're looking for summer vacation or airport reading and you like Ms. Pilcher's work, this would fill the bill."
1,"Weak, predictable and dull","The characters are dull and the main character is passive to an unbelievable degree. Her main attribute is an ability to fall asleep when left alone with the man she will marry. The plot is weak even for a romance. When the author found herself in a hole, she killed a couple of characters off, and it conveniently allowed her to end the book in a cliched way."
3,"good, but not her best","I love all books by Pilcher. She has a way of creating such memorable characters that you actually feel as though you personally know. She has fantastic books about seemingly ordinary things that somehow manage to totally consume the reader. This book was good, but not great. If you are new to Pilcher's work, I would not recommend this as your first read. I would try September, The Shell Seekers, or Winter Solstice first to truly experience the genius and magical writing that is Rosamunde Pilcher."
5,Very good reading,It is a fascinating story every one should read.I love the Arctic winter and love to read about it
4,The Cruelest Miles,"I am doing genealogical research on one of the participants mention in ""The Cruelest Miles"" and found the book most help in narrowing my research. I found the book well written and documented."
4,Very enjoyable,If you like history and/or dogs you will enjoy this book. Children enjoy books about Balto and this is the real thing.
1,Couldnt even finish it,"The book went off on random stories/ tangents on every page. It didnt really stick with the dog saving people theme, it was more just all over the place."
3,"Great story, not so great writing","I completely agree with one of the previous reviewers that the writing style detracts substantially from the joy of reading this book. The story is a wonderful accounting of an historic event, and the authors have researched the diphtheria epidemic, the serum run, and Alaska well. However, as stated before, the frequent digressions are frustrating and make it difficult to stay engrossed. Further, there are numerous typos and mistakes in the book. It is seldom that I find *any* mistakes in a book, yet I have found at least five in this one and I am not yet finished. More careful proofreading is needed. Nevertheless, dog lovers, history buffs, and adventure enthusiasts will all find this an enjoyable read."
5,A Miracle,"We see Clara through a glass darkly but someday... Well, that day is here. The clarity of this edition is miraculous, a breathtaking restoration. The dogfight footage is unequaled. I was moved to tears by the power of the story, by Clara's beauty and by the loving care taken by those who did the restoration. Thank you."
5,Wings.,"I agree, this is a must buy, love this movie,and the dog fights scenes are great. I seen this on TCM, and could not wait to buy, glad I did, has extras of plane history ect..Clara Bow is wonderful, also you will see a very small role of Gary Cooper. Thumbs up!"
1,Wings what,"A must not buy, just rent it, this is an old movie, it not worth to buy rightnow, i will buy it for a buck free shipping lol."
5,Congratulations Paramount on a beautiful restoration and blu-ray,"The folks at Paramount have done an amazing job rescuing this work, the restoration and blu-ray are everything you'd hope they'd be.About the film itself, it's a great introduction to silent cinema to students and novices as well as a thrill for cineastes.I prefer the new recording of the original score with the Ben Burtt sound effects to the organ track which is personal preference.Highly recomended, I'm hope to support future restorations from Paramount."
5,The reel deal,"Reality as special effect, this movie sets the standard for every subsequent action movie. This type of production can't be reproduced at any price. Most Steve McQueen movies and Saving Private Ryan keep it up, but it all started here. Any movie collection should have this, along with Keaton, Chaplin and Lloyd."
4,also listen alzo&udine,"Very cool as with all Hall&Oates,but you should also hear Alzo & Udine who were doing that feel in 68 & are now known in Japan.Also ""Alzo"" on Arista/BMG Japan reissue just released 12/17/03"
4,Great 80's pop songs... This one's a keeper!,"There's a certain charm to Somewhere Down The Road. If you like feel-good pop and those power ballads this one's for you. The duet with Peabo Bryson is especially nice and to my surprise Cybill holds her own on the track. I have to say ""Shot Through The Heart"", ""Push For You"" and ""Bend"" are my favorites though. When I hear these songs I can't help but to swept away in a time warp to the era we call the 80's. The simplicity of the arrangements showcase's Cybill's voice quite nicely. Furthermore, the instruments (especially the synthesizers) sound nostalgic rather than dated.I was surprised I hadn't heard of this CD until 1996. I'm equally surprised that the songs weren't hits. There's some really great material on here. Although, I don't listen to this CD on a daily basis it's a nice treasure to stumble acrosss in my music collection every now and then. Give it a listen!"
1,Amateur recording that would be very tiresome above minimal volume ...,"The samples indicate the microphone placements are too close to the action and make the piano sound unnaturally resonant. I've bought recordings like this before and tired of them almost immediately.It was clearly recorded by someone with limited experience or ability, and should be re-recorded."
1,I Should Have listened To Susan,I should have believed what Susan had to say about this product. It is a waste of money. Hard to navigate and not even an address / contact book. You have to go through file after file and folder after folder to get what you want. Very dis-satified and I welcome contact from the Company to discuss.
1,Nolo no longer makes or supports this software.,"Nolo no longer makes or supports Personal Record Keeper 5.I used to use it, but was horrified when it stopped working and I could not get support.I lost all of the information and household inventory I had input.I created an entire company, Habitudes LLC, based on the need for personal and household record keeping software.Habitudes' household record keeper is called ""Matters of Fact"", and you can preview it at [...]. It's webware, so the application and data is password protected and stored ""in the cloud"" where you can share it with another family member if you wish. You can retrieve your records from home, the office, while traveling, from a PC, MAC or mobile device...anywhere there's internet access.You don't need software to create a household inventory. It's easier just to create a spreadsheet or word document and keep your receipts in an accordion file."
5,murder in the hamptons's dvd,I purchased this as a gift. The recipient was thrilled because she is a Poppy Montgomery fan. The order arrived quickly and the price was great. Thank you for the good service.
5,A Must Have,"William Cullina, of the New England Wild Flower society, is a highly regarded expert in Native plants. This book is the woody counterpart to his Wildflower book. Included are tips on using, growing and propagating these native wonders in North America. The photography and information provided are a source like none other. This is a must have for anyone interested in restoring the ecology of the landscape through the use of natives - beginners and experts alike - an excellent reference."
3,Good writing with mediocre illustrations,"This book is a valuable guide to native woody plants. The habits, landscape value, propagation and culture of most( a few are missing) of the important plants are described in a very readable manner. Cullina clearly draws from a deep well, I had the impression that he had much more that he could have included, but what is here is great.There are a couple of criticisms. The photos are relativly sparse compared to the recent books by Dirr or Darke and are not at all well-reproduced. One picture per genus just ain't enough when there is such wonderful variation within genera. Also, the pronunciation guide for Latin plant names is occasionally bizarre...since when does ""Aesculus"" have four syllables? (But maybe he is right I couldn't find any native Latin speakers to ask) Finally, the book has a clear East coast bias. Although there are many Western US plants that are mentioned, I suspect that many are missing.Buy this book for the prose."
4,It's a keeper!,"This is a great reference book, well organized and well written. My first choice for a tree and shrub guide is Dirr's Hardy Trees and Shrubs, but since it is out of my price range I believe that William Cullina's book is by far the next best book on this subject. It's a great guide and also enjoyable to have around to browse through. My only regret with this book is that the illustrations are not always of the whole plant and there aren't enough of them."
5,Wonderful Work,"Wonderful Work! Pedro Santoni does a great job of making the reader understand the near political impossibility of keeping the power and keeping the peace in Mexico in 1846. Following Parades, his party, and his lust for power, Santoni allows the reader to see the complexities in Mexico during the Mexican War. He also does well in helping the reader to understand the Santa Ana Wild Card. Essential for any true study of the Mexican War."
1,Mini groomer with large grooming capabilities,"I wanted a mini groomer to take care of fine cutting details on my dog's face. Unfortunately, though the body is smaller, the guards and blades are those of a large groomer making the whole thing pointless."
3,Must-see for Hydroplane Enthusiasts,"In every sport there's a legend or two; but the history of hydroplane racing is less well known than, say, football or NASCAR, so its great stories are largely untold. This little movie, starring a young James Caviezel (Person of Interest), with a lovely contribution by Bruce Dern, Of interest, a young Mary McCormack (In Plain Sight) plays the wife of the lead character. reveals a heartwarming story from the history of hydroplane racing. More than merely family appropriate, it could become a favorite of your family for its theme -- the unlikely underdog overcomes all odds to triumph in a way that lifts up a small, midwestern community."
3,Surprisingly good true story,I bought Madison because I've been shooting a documentary in southern Indiana and I've been there half a dozen times recently. I had never heard of this movie. It has all the trappings of an underdog small-town down on its luck movie--some characters are so nauseatingly cliche it defies explanation. But this movie has a lot of heart and it's based on a true story. The best part of the movie for me was at the end when the ABC Wide World of Sports footage rolls during credits and you get to see the actual people reacting to Kieth Jackson almost exactly as they had portrayed in the film. That's great stuff. The DVD is anamorphic 16x9 and the cinematography is top notch! Nothing we haven't seen before but it's honest and heartfelt. Disc arrived as expected and in good shape.
5,I'm Prejudiced,"I love the town so I was pleased when I loved the movie. Madison was filmed on location in the Indiana river town. It is a family movie which involves father/son bonding, husband/wife conflicts, small town loyalties, and the sport of unlimited speed boat racing.My wife and I have been visiting the town for over twenty years and it was fun to see so many familiar sites. In addition, there were a couple of walk ons by people we have become acquainted with in the town. And lastly, there is a happy ending. I love happy endings, especially when based on true stories."
2,"OK for an enthusiast, otherwise pretty boring","I purchased this item to get some action packed cinematography about boat racing. There is a few, but basically you see grim looking guys sitting in slightly rocking boats being sprayed with water and oil. The boats are antiques and are obviously not driven hard/fast. At least not as hard and fast if compared with shorter up-to-date video footage you can find on the internet. It is nice to see some of the old boats in action though. The plot may be based on a true story but will put any child to sleep. Even I had a real hard time watching the whole thing. And I cannot possibly justify to show it to my boatbuilding students (age 14 and up)or the younger ones for entertainment. Because it just is not entertaining. Even most documentaries are more interesting."
1,over rated!!!!!,"we couldn't wait to see this movie! we waIted for 8 tears for it to come out. WHEN IT FINALLY DID WE PUT ALL OUR MONEY (AND OTHER PEOPLES) INTO IT. WE HAD A BIG PREMERE ETC. WE PUT ALL OUR MONEY INTO IT, THINKING THAT IT WOULD BRING TOURISM TO MADISON. THEN IT CAME OUT AND LAYED THERE LIKE A DEAD FISH IN THE POLUTED OHIO RIVER. NOW WE ARE BROKE. THIS MOVIE HAS VERY LITTLE TRUTH TO IT. IT RIDES ON THE HEELS OF A LITTLE GO NOWHERE TOWN THAT IS STILL NOWHERE! THE STORY LINE IS AS POOR AS THE WRITING. THE TOWNS PEOPLE LOOK LIKE STUPID HICKS. BUT YOU SHOULD COME AND SEE IT, AND THEN VISIT MADISON, SO L LYTLE CAN RECOUPE OUR MONEY. BOTTOM LINE, BORRING PLOT, BAD ACTING, SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH IT IS FUNNY. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY."
2,Really not that useful,"I really didn't find this book very useful. Some of the ideas are good but most of them are just very, very slight variations on each other. As for the good ideas, you can find those in many other books, along with many more useful ones. Skip this and use The Instant Curriculum, which is wonderful."

3,It's Great,"The movie was very imformative, and was a great help on my National Parks Project. Lot's of information, and great pictures, and narration"
2,Good but too short to justify cost,"This booklet contains some good information, but there is too little useful data to justify the cost. Try David Barton's DVDs instead. They're chock full of information."
2,Bias & Outdated,"I was assigned this as a mandatory reading for a Ph D course. I have to admit the distaste that it produced in me to find the author comparing in the same paragraph Neo-nazis claiming that their was no Holocaust to people upset about the removal of prayer due to the fact we think this to be as ""godless"", also the right that we have as revisionist to verify our true history? (p12 bottom, 13 top)I understand that a school must remain neutral and keep the peace. But to teach in this book that groups like this are trouble (the third group as he calls it) and will bring only warfare to a school leader is downright bias. I have to say, I will have trouble reading the remainder, but if he already has this mindset in the beginning, I know it will not be a joy to read the rest. I give it a two for some appropriate information, but just not worth the money I paid for since it is 12 years old with his insight. Most Definitely outdated for our time of innovation processes and technology."
1,Over priced piece of garbage,College professors who order and use this must be getting paid kickback money as this book is JUNK! It's not worth the paper it is written on.
4,Pictographic Melody,"Strange Rituals is just that; a study by David Byrne of how we look at the world, see the divine in the strange and take joy from it. Overall the free verse that accompaines the pictures adds to the books attraction. Some are stories, others seem meaningless. But this is David Byrne after all.... If you like his music buy it - otherwise only if your into umm... Strange Things :)"
4,A labor of love,"This is truly a labor of love: an 800-page, oversized biography of Lydia Maria Child, a woman who even at her death was mostly forgotten. Child was a prodigeous writer and social activist - staunch abolitionist, Indian advocate, feminist - who wrote ceaselessly for her causes (her bibliography contains hundreds of items). Karcher explores Child's life in great depth and with loving care. Anyone even remotely interested in Child or the world she inhabited will find this book useful and enjoyable."
1,Inferior quality,I own the MPC 2-disk LP release from mid 70's and expected this to be of the same quality. IT IS NOT!!! This is a Polka City release. and is of very inferior quality. Infact only 1 cut-the Julida Polka is similar to the MPC quality.
1,Atrocious sound quality,"Why do re-releases by ""Whoopee"" John Wilfahrt sound so BAD? This one is truly atrocious. It sounds as though a microphone was placed near the speaker of a 1930's console radio-phonograph playing a 78-rpm record. This is really a pity, because ""Whoopee"" John had some really nice recordings, mostly on 45 rpm singles, on the Decca label in the late 50s and early 60s. These are the ones that should be re-released! But please be careful, remakers! Center your records carefully on your turntables so as not to introduce wow and flutter into the CD versions."
2,Whoopee John!!,"The music selections are great. I love Whoopee John! However, there is a loss in the quality of sound on this recording. I think it could have been done better, but I wanted some of John Wilfahrt's music and this is all I could find. We need more of this vintage music, but better quality in the recording of the CD."
5,funny ass redneck shit,"i gave this cd 5 stars for nonstop laughter.if you like rodney carrington then check out jay hickman.i don't know if this is true but to me it sounds like jay hickman was a influence to rodney,i might be wrong though.alot of people that i talk to who like rodney hasn't heard of jay hickman.i like rodney alot and if you do,all i'm saying is check out jay hickman's comedy cd's as well."
4,rodney carrington,"i heared his songs on bob and tom radio show, so i thought i would buy one of his cd's"
5,Funny,"I am not an Art critic. I don't profess to know what he was really trying to express with this work or who he was trying to reach, but this is a humorous, Adult CD. I enjoyed it."
5,Comedy at it's finest,If you like to laugh then this is one of the many cd's of Rodney Carrington that you'll enjoy. In a world where people take themselves to seriously this is a way to lighten up. Enjoy!
5,rodney carrington greatest hits,I order this as a christmas present for someone who has everything....it turned out to be the perfect gift....this person had been to a rodney carrington concert and was thrilled with the cd.
1,Crap,"This is the stupidest, most ignorant ""comedy"" that I have ever listened to. Some guys in my military unit thought this was the funniest thing ever and listened to it over and over and over when we were overseas. If I ever hear this crap again, I will scream. The jokes are crude, dumb and racist. He just made all rednecks look even dumber(and that takes some doing). If you want something really funny, stay away from this crap."
4,JUST BUY THE FULL VERSIONS.,"It's funnier to hear the full album or albums, instead of the highlights from multiple albums. You can get into the groove better."
3,"Some of the material was funny but despite knowing it was adult rated, I still found the swearing to be more than I cared for.","His use of the ""F"" word exceeded even my worst fears and it is hard to see that the material would have been less funny had he used better language"
4,Great hiking pants!,"These pants are so well made and sturdy. They withstood a weeklong backpacking trip which included some hands&knees climbing over rocks! They dry up quickly, which is great if it rains during a hike. They are extremely comfortable, lightweight, and good for all different temperatures."
1,Making Memories,Didn't enjoy this. Just found pages of words with little to break it up or even some drawings or pictures would've been good.
5,My favourite yoga dvd!,Definitely the best yoga dvd I have purchased to date. Not only is this incredibly relaxing but it also provides a great workout to strengthen your muscles. The poses are well explained and flow easily from one to the next. I also love how the practice is split into two sections: an active sequence and a restorative sequence. Hoping for more yoga dvd from Self in the near future!
3,There's Nothing Special About This DVD!,"I was looking for a de-stresser and I didn't get it in ""Self-Ulitmate De-Stress Yoga."" It was too repetitive with the warrior 1 and 2 poses, and the instructor's cueing was just blah. The two young ladies in the back appeared to be beginners as well. Not that there's something wrong with that, but, I just didn't hate or love the DVD. If I had to do it over again, I would have passed on this one. I didn't feel the energy, scenery, nor the background music.Overal rating 2.0"
3,John Barry's current state of mind,"This album is a continuation of Barry's recent style heard in ""The Beyondness of Things"". It has that mellow easy listening quality that at first glance sounds repetitious of his recent work. Of his recent compositions, I would recommend ""Playing by Heart"". The classic Barry sound can also be heard in the recent recordings of ""Last Valley"" and ""Robin and Marian"". Finally, ""Moviola"" still stands out as an excellent compilation of his finest themes."
2,Dispensable,"The music on this CD is well recorded and makes very agreeable listening. There are, however, no outstanding melodies or themes. I would categorize what I heard as ""sonic doodling."" Quite frankly, I would not encourage anyone to purchase this album. Much superior choices would be John Barry's ""Moviola"" and ""Moviola II."""
2,"Some good ideas, but hardly unique","Anyone who is familiar with the think-oustide-the-box genre of self-improvement and creativity books will find very little new or inspiring here. And despite the title, the book also has very little to do with Einstein. A deeper analysis of the great thinker's intellectual history woud have been more useful than the largely recycled do's and dont's that dominate the book.The points presented here, however, are hardly without merit, especially the tips on brainstorming and free association."
1,The worst... close to nothing!,This is the worst book... and the price...I understand that if it is around $20 I am expecting something good... but not this!
5,Many great techniques for jumpstarting your creativity,"Personally, this has been a very helpful, useful audio book for me. It's helped me learn to think out of the box in my own inventing as well as in everyday life. I've used the techniques in this book often over the years."
2,HOW TO THINK....WITHOUT RULES,"This book aims to teach you new ways to solve problems, increase the profitability of your business, improve educational opportunities for your children, make artisistic and creative breakthroughs, and enhance the quality of your life. Does it succeed? Yes...sort of.Essentially, its most salient content centers on the breaking of rule-ruts, which are ingrained patterns of thinking which we mistake for truths. Scott Thorpe, the book's author, says that rule ruts are like railroad tracks: if you want to go to where the railroad track goes, just follow it. But if you don't, you have to get off of it. In short, break your own rules of thinking.While Albert Einstein is the perfect person to reference in the contextualization of the book's premise, it runs out of steam rather quickly. The topic would have made a great, in-depth article. As a book, it has its moments, just not enough of them."
3,Well some of it is doable but...,"Well the book is a great read but, keep in mind that you cannot always break the rules to succeed. It is good to think out of scope from which the society taught you but not all the time! and it is definitely not the recipe to success..."
5,FABULOUS!!,"Got this CD after seeing a special on PBS.Wow, those liberals can sing! (ha)The songs have deep meaning and some a touch of humor too!!I really want to buy their latest CD, IN THESE TIMES...it looks like it could be there best ever. PPM getting better with age like a fine wine. This is a very spiritually happy and healthy trio...and OH what a life they have had.Even Republicans may like some of their songs."
5,The Temptones are the Bomb,"I think that the Temptones are wonderful and I am not just saying this because Barry Glazier is my boss, but truly they are great."
4,loved this doc,"I saw this movie at Cinema Village in NY and was so impressed by its raw, fly-on-the-wall approach. Being a New Yorker I knew nothing of the plight of these farmers in South Central LA and their attempts to take on greedy developers and city hall to save their community garden, but this story has universal appeal. An enthralling and necessary doc."
4,Great book to have as a reference!,"This book is a very concise, easy to read, well written reference to have around the ICU, step-down, etc. It is perfect for someone new to the speciality or if you are looking for another way ""to skin the cat"". Covers everything that could come up post-operatively. I highly reccommend it."
2,Shakes and Bounces,"The pins that fasten the stabilizer to the ladder do fasten the two together, however, being pins only, they allow the stabilizer to slide recklessly from left to right. For me, especially at heights, this can be terribly disconcerting. As a builder I've used and owned far better stabilizers that don't shake and bounce like this and I'm quite surprised this one is so popular. Overall, while well made, I think it's poorly designed and unpleasant to use. I give it a two-star for the quality materials but I would not recommend this tool."
4,It works really well but..,"I received my stabilizer and I took no time to set this up and mount it on my ladder. I found the stabilizer somewhat self-explanatory to install and can just about be setup by simply looking at the pictures. Saying all that, the instruction are rather vague and caused me a little confusion at times. My other gripe were the parts used to make this thing are very sharp. It was like working with a cheese grater. I suffered several cuts while setting this thing up. Be sure to use gloves or take the time sanding the edges down a bit. Other than that the stabilizer works surprisingly well. I felt much more confident climbing my roof with the use of this thing. The rubber/plastic stand-off did a great job from not sliding around and didn't have any issues damaging any shingles. I highly recommend anyone to purchase this product.I would've giving it 5 stars but i had to use way too many bandages seting it up.."
3,Carry on with the Kybers,"This is a chilly little novel, with a rather bleak feel to it, not unlike the Onogorovian landscape. As with many SF books this is a novel of ideas and there's nothing wrong with that. However, although a couple of the characters are reasonably well fleshed out for the most part they lack any real depth, and this, compounded with the absence of any cohesive plot, leaves the reader with a somewhat empty feeling. That said, the ideas are very interesting and some of the descriptive prose is nicely written, particularly when depicting the desolate planet on which the team are based. Perhaps it's because this is a collaborative project that the book lacks an emotional centre. With a greater regard for the human aspect it would have been a much better novel."
3,The aliens are more believable than the humans,"A team of interstellar explorers confronts the mystery of the Kybers, a part-organic, part-metallic race of aliens who seem blissfully unconcerned about the imminent supernova that will cast their planet adrift. Some believe that they may represent a higher plane of spiritual evolution, while others see them as a threat to mankind. The debate is brought to a head when a group of the Kybers request asylum.Authors Ian Watson and Michael Bishop have developed some interesting aliens but are less convincing with their human characters. The behavior of the ship's crew is too unprofessional to be believable and the way national origin determines character is heavy-handed and potentially offensive. Nevertheless, the basic conundrum of the aliens and their enigmatic behavior retains interest."
4,"Amazing, but a bit expensive.","I've seen Skywind live and heard their CD, and they are an amazing new group out of Minneapolis, MN. Their music is much deeper and more original than most other new rock bands. I only give 4 stars because the CD is unusually expensive. I have communicated with the band about this, and they told me it was because their record label is very small. Be assured, O2 is well worth the money, Skywind is simply amazing."
2,Very Boring.....,"I bought this game a few months after it came out and was very excited to get it. When I started to play it though it didn't take long to realize that it's the same six ""mini games"" over and over again. You read more in this game than you play. I wouldn't buy it again. Save your money."
3,It was ok,"I was actually disappointed by the book. I just didn't find the humor all that funny. It is made painfully obvious that the author doesn't care for Gabrielle all that much. I am a huge Xena fan, but this book just didn't do much for me."
3,Tickles the Funny Bone,"Bought this book for a friend and we spent the weekend going through it, pulling out what we thought were our favorite jokes and phrases. Unfortunately, the XENA craze is getting to a point where ""the powers that be"" will do anything to make a buck. It's fun but rather pointless and, for those of us who do not subscribe to the idea that Xena and Gabrielle are ""more than friends"" a little insulting. Humor is one thing but don't shove something in our faces that doesn't need to be shoved. But otherwise, there are some chuckles to be had here. Recommended."
3,Works OK.,"Fair is fair. I ordered it and they sent me a much much cheaper cable than the one pictured. I was refunded the purchase price, but I still see that it's listed so...be careful and call/email before you order. Oh, and I kept the cheap cable. That's why I gave them 3 instead of 2 stars. Good luck."
3,Not Too Bad,"Despite Sharukh Khan's mediocre acting and larger than life personality in almost each and every one of his films, he comes through as a all-around entertainer. I don't think that Shahrukh Khan is a good actor, but he has a charismatic personality that attracts attention, keep an audience loyal. Irfan Khan plays his role beautifully and I personally find him to be a more mature, versatile actor than most of his Bollywood peers. I only gave this film three stars because I tend to be very critical of Bollywood films and actors in general. But this film is a winner and very much enjoyable. Buy it!"
2,Not Another Filler Bunny,"Jhonen Vasquez created filler bunny on a whim when he acidentally was left with a blank page in one of his original comics. Filler Bunny's fame has grown since then, causing numberous spin-off comics of just Filler, trying depserately to fill up the required space with interesting things. As you can imagine, JV gets hard up for ideas. This comic was no different. If you collect Vasquez's comics, get it; it will provide you with mild entertainment. Otherwise, go buy a latte or something, you crazy monkey."
2,Disappointed with this book,I like Johnen Vasquez mainly because of Invader Zim (one of the greatest shows of all time) but also because of his Squee book (very funny stuff). This book didn't have me laughing very much. I liked what he was trying to do here but the comedy fell flat more often than entertained.
3,WHAT A STRANGE CARTOON COMICBOOK!,"UH....I WANTED A COMIC BOOK BY JHONEN VASQUEZ SINCE I LIKED WATCHING INVADER ZIM.I THINK INVADER ZIM WAS A MILD CARTOON COMPARED TO THIS COMICBOOK AND SOME OF WHAT'S WRITTEN IN IT! SOME IS FUNNY,BUT SOMEPARTS OF THIS COMICBOOK ARE REALLY WIERD IN A FUNNY WAY,OR JUST WIERD/FREAKY!MONKEYS UP THE BUTT OF FILLERBUNNY,DOOKIE,ABORTO...? DUDE IS TRULY STRANGE! I HOPE HE'S NOT ONE OF THOSE WIERDO FREAKS WHO LIKES DOOKIE AND MONKEYS UP THE BUTT,EW!THE BOOK MAKES ME LAUGH,BUT THEN AGAIN PARTS OF IT MAKE ME WANT TO WRETCH....I READ IT AND WILL PROBABLY GIVE IT TO SOMEONE I KNOW WHO WOULD PROBABLY LAUGH THRU THIS INSANE COMICBOOK!"
1,What you really need to know about this book,"I recieved the book in the mail today, and i was very suspicious when i lifted the box, since it was so light. Right there in the middle of the street i opened the box to see 2 little paper thin pamphlets ( i ordered somthing else which i was also dissapointed in too). I was like what the.... As soon as i got into the house, i ripped open the plastic to find the smallest book in the world. All i did was read the first page to find the dirtiest language in the world. I can laugh very easily... this was not amusing at all. Flying on magical meat products isn't funny. This book seriously makes no sense.Please don't waste your money on this book..... buy somthing funnier on amazon."
1,Stay Away,"I like the look of this watch but the automatic movement inside is a piece of crap.I have plenty of automatics from many different brands and have no problems from any of them, except from stuhrling. This is the second out of four from them that just does not run properly. And yes I wound it plenty and no I'm not expecting it to be right on after every hour, I'm talking it just stops after 3min, 5 min. They must use the cheapest movements they can find -- Stay Away!"
2,Do not waste your money :(,"I purchased this based on the picture and description. The price was good. I was disappointed quickly once they arrived. This watch looks good and has a good a solid feel ... outside ... however, once you start playing with you see the problems quickly:- Crown is so loose I would be really worried to expose it to any wet conditions (not even talking about washing my hands)- The crown winding did not work - tried multiple times - stopped after 1 minute of running.I have returned the watch. I was particular disappointed as you can get a nice Seiko or Citizen for this price and those would work forever.In short - do not waste your time and money and get Seiko or a Citizen."
1,nice but fragile,"Bought this watch last december. The looks is nice but a litle bit too light for automatic wacth. For the price cannot complain, for the looks especially the interesting blue cross leather band is amazing deal. The only problem the thing is very fragile, i only used it for 2 months and one day I clap so hard at meetings suddenly the mechanical loosen it self and not long after that all the gear just fell off. I used many mechanical watches from many brands with various prices and this is first time i have to deal with this. Quite a suprise for sthurling brand too make this lousy watch, better watch out for this brand for their quality assurance."
4,Good Beginning,"This book is a great introduction to the field, and also appears to be a great handbook for someone in the trenches. For most practicing attorneys though, the book's use is limited to understanding the dynamics and basic operation of the practice. A more focused work is recommended for legal professionals."
2,Not as helpful as it looks,"The information provided by this book is limited. It touches several variations of ABS using case studies and market introduction but has done nothing but repeat the securitization process and entities involving the process. It's ok as an intoduction book but far from a good ""handbook"". I would not recommend it for any quants or traders as it tells not much about how to model and hedge ABS's."
5,Relaxing and Stimulating,"I've been looking for some music to just chill out to for quite some time. This box set hits the mark. All of it is great. Great sounds. Great vibes. And enough difference between songs, that you don't feel like you are stuck listening to the same thing over and over. Being three discs is great too. I just keep them running in sequence and go about my tasks of chores around the house, reading, or just chilling out on the couch.After a long day at work in my cubicle, I just need to hear something other than noise and this music takes the tension away."
3,Fun but frustrating,"Being a major Star Trek fan for many years, I was really looking forward to this crossword puzzle book. And, in most ways, it is enjoyable to work these puzzles. But, there is Star Trek information in these puzzles that are wrong, especially certain spellings. I have checked multiple entries against Star Trek reference material that I have and from the official Star Trek web-site, and sometimes these puzzle clues/answers are wrong. Also, as mentioned by someone else, these puzzles are very challenging. If you don't have some detailed ST reference material, you will probably be pretty frustrated. Some of the answers to the entries are two or more words, but the author doesn't tell you that. And some of the non-Star Trek questions are very, very obscure. But, I've learned alot! I'm just not sure that I'll buy any more of this author's crossword books."
1,Super Cheap and Cheeeesee!,"I thought these would be at least a little thicker than CONSTRUCTION PAPER! They can't be left on the vehicle in the wither because they can ""crack in the cold""?!?! The mounting pads remain on the vehicle, but without the louver (very pretty). Forget about going through a car wash with them on. SUPER CHEAP!"
5,"A Fair Documentary, Not ""Biased""","It's true that more time is devoted to Lennon during this period but the documentary isn't a ""hatchet job"" on McCartney by any means. Lennon's work during these years is just more deserving of extended reflection. McCartney receives plenty of positive attention for what he did produce at the time. Both songwriters are praised and criticized by the commentators. The next DVD in the series (covering 1973-1980) devotes more time to McCartney's output because there's more to examine from that period."
1,Hatchet Job on McCartney,A horrible DVD that does not depict the post output of McCartney fairly. It is inaccurate and slanted. Sounds like Yoko wrote it. All McCartney fans should stay away.
4,Interesting 3rd DVD in the series.,"The DVD is ""Lennon-heavy"", but to be fair, Lennon's ""outside The Beatles"" recording was more prolific in a way. Sure, Paul did a lot of experimenting in those years, but not much made vinyl.I love the trilogy of DVDs, though, and has watched them more than once. Fantastic for the true fans."
1,mccartney is poorly represented!,"Please buy this if you are likely to enjoy a completely sycophantic deluded lesson on the greatness of john lennon as a solo artist then this is the dvd for you.any mention of mccartney's work is not only severly biased but far too slightly covered.the truth is lennon missed mccartney as much as the other way around,indeed possibly much more.john lennons early 1970s work is totally overated here whilst paul mccartney's is totally underated.this is not a balanced view and a a pretty miserable beatles docu.i do believe the next in the series covering their work from 1973-1980 is actually being released this week [nov2011].it will be interesting to see the 'lennon spin' his hero worshipers put on his miserable output during this period whilst mccartney went on to become the biggest selling artist in the world all over again.!"
2,Jumping The Shark,"hmmm.... we're supposed to love this album because it was recorded with the who's who of session musicians.we're supposed to love this mediocre album because charles went ""all the way down"" to nashville to record.we're supposed to love this sleep-inducing album because it's lyrical content is so sincere and heartfelt.i don't love this album, i barely even like it. the covers are decent and 'atom in my heart' is probably the highlite. everything else is just ho-hum.my questions for charles thompson: what's wrong with rehearsing? what's wrong with multiple takes? what's wrong with some selectiveness???not everything frank black touches turns into gold anymore. it used to! but the old bag of tricks seems depleted. maybe he'll dig down and find some more. but he didn't for this record."
2,Agreed...Possible Jumping of the Shark..,"First of all...I'll tell you this...Frank is my favorite musician...It took me a while warm up to his solo stuff but have grown to absolutely love his music...have especially enjoyed the alt-country direction of his last few albums. However, to me, this album is a disappointment...Soul-less and too polished (YES I understand it's essentially recorded live with little to no overdubbing!) but I stand by my point. The album is almost entirely devoid of the ""Frankisms"" that make his stuff so special and enduring for me... No disrespect, but I really couldn't care less about the credentials of the session musicians, the producer, or the history behind the studio that it was recorded in...I'd much rather him go back to the mobile studio with some no-names and bang out some more quirky songs...that's what makes Frank... Frank!"
5,I Love the Pixies - I Love this album,"terrific songs, musicianship, and singing. Country with a little more edge. You forget what a gift for melody Frank Black has.Has not left my player in days..."
5,"Different from the Pixies, but AWESOME","Having been a fan of the Pixies, i tried really hard to like Frank Black's solo work. I didn't really like those albums, until i heard this one. It sounds a lot different, more like Wilco. If you're into smooth sounding rifts with Black's crazy lyrics, buy this CD. I got it 2 months ago, and it still hasn't left my cd changer"
3,the verdict is still out on this one,"Honeycomb is a tough album for me to write about because i have not made up my mind on whether or not i like it. overall, it's a fine record, full of generally well-written songs that stradle an acoustic sound with Frank's oddball lyrics and unusual meter. but for every track that is a winner (""I Burn Today"", ""My Life In Storage"") there are plenty of other songs that are merely ""okay."" not that bad...but not that good. a general feeling of a lazy, sunbaked afternoon is heavy on these recordings and that is really nice, but it can't help cover up some of the lackluster tunes. i'm still listening to it and trying to soak it in and hoping that it will grow on me a bit more. because i want to enjoy it more than i do right now. hmmm....unfortunately, there's really no hope in getting past the lifeless graphic design job that this compact disc comes encased in. somebody find Mister Black proper artist, please!"
5,Jumping The Shark? NO!!!!,"To the two reviews saying that Frank jumped the shark I have to disagree. As of now this is my cd of '05! If you're a fan of The Pixies or Frank Black buy thecd! Simple as that, this is classic Frank, just a little more mellow. There's nothing more needed to be said, the cd speaks for itself!"
5,"Honeycomb - Great Songs, Great Record.","Honeycomb's packed with great songs. It's slower, more mellow, and more mature than previous Frank Black records; but it still rocks. Honeycomb is filled with heartfelt lyrics and incredible music created by Frank Black and some of the greatest musicians America has known. Grab a seat, grab a drink, put on Honeycomb and relax. You'll love it."
2,Sleep inducing,Oh boy... couldn't agree more with the reviewer that said that he didn't care about the backing musicians or producer..... it seems that people are interested in this record for everything that isn't to do with Frank Black.Oh well.... listening to this I can see why he decided to re-form the Pixies.... by the way I loved his first two solo albums but the cracks started appearing in the quality control dept already in The Cult of Ray
4,Kids love video now xp,"Our son received video now xp as a gift, and it has kept him happy all weekend. He loves that he'll be able to take it in the car for long (or short) trips. I love that it will help our kids to not fight in the backseat. There are lots of possible PVDs we purchase for the future. A much better alternative than our laptop or renting a DVD player for car or airplane trips. We're thrilled!"
4,"Happy with the system, but frustrated with finding appropriate videos for my six year old","My 6-year old son received the VideoNow XP for his 6th birthday from my sister. She also bought him the Scooby Doo interactive movie. He enjoys the movie, but gets frustrated with getting past each point. Overall he enjoys his new toy.My frustration, however, is that I have looked online for more videos, and it shows them, but says they are currently unavailable. That I have seen for the past few weeks. Target has a very limited number of the PVD's and most I don't feel are appropriate for my six year old ie, the older kid shows. I would like to see more educational interactive movies, because after getting through the Scooby show, I think my son has become bored with it.............."
4,"good, good...some cons",I love it! it's really light weight and portble. The batteries do go dead without the charger and the PVDs should have more then 30 minutes-60minutes. I like this video now alot. Calling it a toy is a little far fetched but it's wonderful. I hope you buy it!
4,Okay,"At first I was disappointed that it didn't have a closure, but realized it would be more costly if it did!"
1,SPAM Email from Author,"Rabbi Yirmeyahu Bindman is a little unclear on the concept of unsolicited emails, know to most as SPAM. From the content of such SPAM received from the Rabbi, I gather that he is full of himself and irritating to boot."
2,"Disturbing, unpleasant,soft porn film","I watched this film because it was supposed to be about the murder of Bob Crane. It was supposedly based on the book ""The Death of Bob Crane"". But, it in reality it was basically a soft core porno film about sex addiction. Greg Kinnear (who gives an excellent performance) states on the comment track of the DVD that body doubles were used for his ""sex"" scenes and Willem Defoe says he was angry that he did not get to do the ""sex"" scenes. Seems an indication of the opposite types of men they are.The documentary on the DVD goes into detail about the police investigation and the actual murder and is much more interesting. That was the only thing that saved the DVD for me.Usually I'm a fan of Greg Kinnear but watching him in this film was like seeing a well liked personality like Mickey Mouse play Jack the Ripper."
4,A flawed portrait of a flawed man,"Greg Kinnear gives one of his better performances as late Hogan's Heroes star Bob Crane, a man who lost everything from his starpower, to both his marriages, and finally his life because of his sexual addiction. At the center of his addiction is John Carpenter (no, not the director) played by the always excellent Willem Dafoe who provided Crane the technology to film their deeds while Crane provided the women. Director Paul Schrader (writer of Taxi Driver and director of American Gigolo) gives a flawed but hauntingly amusing look at Crane's life; whether or not it's all fact can be left up to the viewer, but Auto Focus is carried by the solid performances of Kinnear and Dafoe. The DVD itself has a number of solid extras, including a documentary on Crane's murder and commentaries including one with Kinnear and Dafoe."
1,less of a review and more of a question,"i never saw this film in the cinema, it came and went at the local art house before i gave myself half a chance to see it. the other day i purchased the DVD and after all was said and done, i came to realize something a bit strange. what i want to know is (from you folks whom actually saw it back then): were certain scenes in the film digitally blurred in the theatrical release or is that just exclusive to the DVD? this information would greatly affect my review since censorship, especially in a film of this type, would defeat the purpose of its addition to my collection. if anyone would care to clarify this for me, i would greatly appreciate it.on the plus side, i always get a kick out of seeing rita wilson in any film. not too many people know that one of her first acting jobs was as a cheerleader on the original ""brady bunch"" television program (one of greg's many hotties)."
1,Thumbs down! Zero stars.,Disgusting. I mistakenly thought this DVD was about this guys career as a Hogan Heroes star and trials he suffered up until his death. I didn't know it was about the lascivious lifestyle he led. Kind of kills my view of Hogans Heroes now and even more disgusting he was Disney's Super Dad how frightening. This film was an excuse for people to view soft porn in a regular theatre freely. I can just see people who loved that show might now be disillusioned or turned off of how much he was actually such a pervert in real life. Not a keeper. Will never be part of my collection.
4,Excellent look at a flawed man,"Most people familiar with Hollywood lore know the Bob Crane story: ""Hogan's Heroes"", fame, obsession with sex, over-indulgence, burn-out, mysterious death. ""Auto Focus"" gives the viewer a comprehensive, if not in-depth, look at Crane's rise and fall. Greg Kinnear gives what I think is his best screen performance to date as the happy-go-lucky sex fiend. Willem Dafoe, as always, plays his creepy video technician friend John Carpenter (NOT the kick-ass director of Halloween and Escape From New York) to perfection. Because, honestly, who else can play the creep better than Dafoe?The one thing this movie lacked was a closer look at Crane's psyche; we saw what happened. but we never truly know why. There is some voice-over, but it is used sparingly throughout. Perhaps if it had been utilized more in the right places, some questions that weren't answered might have been. All in all, a very well made and acted film."
3,A must see but maybe not a must buy,"Mr Schrader is something of an artist/anthropologist/moral conscience of American society. In this instance he unveils one consequence of the objectification of women. Mr Kinnear is brilliantly subtle and sad in his best role thus far including Nurse Betty and As Good As It Gets. Mr Dafoe reaffirms his status as one of America's greatest. Decor, music, contrast between middle america and darker america all superb. Sad but very well made film."
4,Good Biopic,"Bob Crane, the lovable character was ""Hogan's Heroes"" led a double life a devoted family man and comedian to his friends and a porn-obsessed guy in private. What led to his tragic death will never be known. Forensics back then wasn't as advanced as it is now. Above the surface, he was a man who was devoted to his first wife and children. The facade started to unfold when he exposed his weakness--sex. He was obsessed with [...] in all sizes and need for sex led to the breakup of two marriages and forestalled his acting. Just as he wanted to regain his fame, he met with tragedy. This movie was good but sometimes it was too gruesome where you couldn't always sit down and completely watch it. I sat through the movie however. It was scary seeing what he worked hard for go down the tubes; and when it seems that things look up for him, there is something holding him back. I wonder if his children have considered reinvestigating the murder case. Maybe they can find leads to his murder."
3,More of an autobiography than a movie,"Entertaining look at the seamy side of a well known star--if you were a fan of the series or interested in stars generally and how they really live, then check it out."
4,Tremendous Acting,"Dafoe's portrayal of techie, John Carpenter, steals the show in this film which effectivly captures the downfall of a downright perverted creep.Kinnear is believable as Bob Crane, from his Catholic family man beginning until he's on top of the world and being lured into the world of infidelity and hardcore porn. The most chilling moment comes when a washed up Crane who no longer hides his lust for perversion, tracks down his teenage son, checks out his son's girlfriend and has a ""man to man talk.""Very interesting, sad, and well made film here."
2,"Interesting, but so what?","It was only going to be a matter of time before Hollywood made a film about the life of Bob Crane. Is it entirely accurate? Probably not based on comments by his family on various websites. Perhaps they are protecting his seemingly seedy image, but at the end of the day evidence has been found to suggest that Crane spent many hours producing home blue movies.The film explores some interesting themes - the cost of fame, the bad side of money, and the value of friendships. Greg Kinnear is excellent as Bob Crane, and William Dafoe is equally as good as the sleazy friend.At the end of the film I thought ""what a sad existence Bob had near the end"" but in a sense he was really happy with how his life ended up. Porn became his world, his obsession."
3,I really think its not relevant to the man.,I really enjoy Hogans Hereos . I think we all have things that we are not willing to share no matter how minor. I think this really boils down to a person just being taken advantage of after death. Isnt that how it always is . A person dies and the media starts to have fun poking at him or her. Its not important wether he was wrong or right . Do any of us have any room to talk. I was angry at what Disney did to him. Expecially when on my last trip to Disney World myself wife and kids had to watch two men making out in the line for the ride . Disney did not bother to say anything to that. Our only choice was to leave the line. They shunned him for being hetrosexual. Mr. Cranes activities were not for the family mind you but dont call the kettle black.
5,Juan Gabriel needs no review HIS STUFF IS ALWAYS GREAT!!,Juan Gabriel has always been my favorite singer. For a person to write and singer as he does just make his music so much enjoyable. His music always sets the mood for me. Juan KEEP ON MAKING MUSIC!!!
2,Poorly written,"Not happy. You must be a real ""dummie"" to find this helpful. I don't like the word. I would suggest this to someone that has no social skills and maybe helpful to people that are not mainstreamed in life."
1,Completely Disappointed,"When ordering this book, I thought I was getting the full-size version. I have looked and looked at the display page and did not find anything anywhere stating it was the pocket-sized version. I ordered this and Dating for Dummies for a friend. Now I have to go find something else for a gift. I would feel like a ""Dummy"" only giving them two small, hard-to-read novelty books!"
4,Great for the kids-4,Another video that is great for the kids and grandkids. I can highly recommend it to parents and grandparents for this reason.
5,"great lip balm, love the size","I love MyChelle Love Your Lips lip balms, so much that I have all of the varieties except Peach Mint which just doesn't sound appealing. This is a large container, think Bonnie Bell lip smackers in the 80s, and is a great value. I have larger lips, so it's also nice to be able to cover them with one swipe. The ingredients are high quality and it really works. My lips stay smooth and soft. The smell is pleasant, reminds me of a cherry popsicle. I highly recommend!"
5,The Two Escobars,"This film is incredible for any soccer fan out there, especially if you remember the US vs Colombia soccer game. This is my favorite of all of the 30 for 30 films."
5,Great,"This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. As soon as I saw it on TV, I had to buy it. I strongly recommend it."
4,Awesome!!!!,One of the best sports documentaries I have ever seen. Very well made and informed.This story has been a question mark for years. Finally the truth is told.
5,Awesome,"This story is so incredible it is hard to believe it is true. ESPN has done an awesome job combining the stories of two very different individuals who lived simultaneously in a country in upheaval, and how their lives intertwine during the disaster that was history. A ""must see"" for anyone interested in Colombia, history, or sports."

1,"Great movie/documentary, Don't buy this version through Amazon","I saw the Movie when it came out, and I thought it was great. I was very disappointed to order it through Amazon and receive a DVD-case, a CD with movie logo printed on it. The disk was blank, and ready to be formatted. There was information on the shrink-wrapping saying that it might not play on some computers. Being a blank CD, it didn't play any device (DVD or computer). It was a waste of my time to buy a cheaper burn as you go DVD-R from Amazon. I will buy the movie in another fashion (possibly through a reseller on Amazon) , but I will never purchase a movie from Amazon in this fashion again. Read the fine print, and don't buy it this manner."
5,great topcaot,This tot coat owns :) thin so you dont use much on each nail but dries with a jelly like coat that is just so smooth :) dries within 2 minutes as long as you dont have to many coats of nail polish under it. quite affordable on here as well :)
2,Not for primary school children,The vocabulary and terminology used by the narrator in this video were too difficult for the elementary school child. I showed 1/2 of the video to my second graders and it was way over their heads! They were just interested in the owl catching prey and regurgitating the owl pellet. Not recommended for elementary (primary) school science programs.
4,Education on Owls,"This is a good movie for anyone interested in learning details about owls. Unlike some other owl movies I have seen, this one brings up the fact that they regurgitate their food into pellets."
4,Strawberry Shortcake Wallet,"I bought this wallet for my granddaughter. She does not live in my area, but she said she really liked the wallet. It was purchased and delivered so quickly that I was surprised. Good job."
2,Debunking Bunk,"Wood is unnecessarily hostile to Franklin, strugling to dispel the images created in the Autobiography rather than understanding their impact and relationship to history. it is a useful book for raw information, but when it comes to analysis of that information, I put far more stock in H.W. Brands' The First American. Brands better undertsands Franklin's gradual coming to a democratic consciousness while Wood only finds contradiction in Franklin's change of mind."
4,A Pleasant Reading,"Being a fairly recent Eastern European immigrant I found the book very inspirational. Gordon Wood tells the story of an extraordinary self-made man in rapidly changing times. If I can relate to Benjamin Franklin, everyone else in this country can.It is also very informative and a nice take on the times when America was founded as a nation. However, I will give it four starts, as I was a little disappointed with how little weight it was given to the Revolution snowballing events."
3,Not What I Expected,"When I saw Gordon Wood on Ben Franklin I thought look out! It's going to be like Ann Coulter on Bill Clinton. I was almost afraid to read because I adore Franklin so much. Alas, nothing new, nothing. (Spoiler!!!!!) Yes Ben cheated on his wife with numerous women, seduced wives, and may have even sold secrets to the British (that last one cannot necessarily be proven). But all Gordon did was write a GREAT little summary about the life of a great man. So why did I only give him only three stars? Well, when you see Mike Tyson you want to see a Pitbull off its leash. When I read Gordon Wood.... I want history off its leash. Now you know what to expect. Enjoy"
4,Trouble in Boston,"Based on Henry James's novel, this movie is a satirical look at the women's emancipation movement around the turn of the century in general, and how one woman (played by Vanessa Redgrave) keeps another (Madeleine Potter) locked away for her own purposes. Unfortunately, the movie does not focus in on this irony strongly enough. Where the movie should be crystal clear in its intentions, it is instead soft-focused and wishy-washy. In addition, Christopher Reeve plays a lawyer who also becomes interested in Potter, setting up a dramatic love triangle. There are some powerful scenes between Reeve and Redgrave, but not enough of them. The period detail is well presented, but that's not enough to keep us fully engaged."
4,"A luminous, sensitive, passionate performance by Vanessa Redgrave","A luminous, sensitive, passionate performance by Vanessa Redgrave anchors this fine version of the Henry James novel.Some of the accents can be jarringly ""off"" (the children sound like they could have walked off the soundstage of a '60s American television series; Christopher Reeves' Southern gentleman sounds forced and unnatural, like an imitation of Clark Gable in ""Gone with the Wind"").But there is much to be praised in this Ivory-Merchant film, from the choice of filming on-location in Boston to the ensemble of smaller mostly female character performances by Jessica Tandy, Linda Hunt, etc.)."
1,Poor Picture Quality,"Whatever this film's artistic merits, they are severely marred by the poor picture quality. The film is too dark, making the night scenes barely visible. When transferring films from VHS (I assume the picture quality was better) to DVD the film should be enhanced not degraded."
1,Movie was damaged.,"Fifteen minutes into the movie, and it began skipping, blurring etc. Went on for another 30 minutes until the movie was unwatchable. Very frustrating that they would not have examined their product before offering it as in good condition...it definitely was NOT. They did refund my original purchase price though but not until I spent another few dollars sending it back to them. All in all, a waster of my time and money."
2,When will this movie end?,The Bostonians is based on a Henry James novel and it is just awful. The plot is not interesting and the characters not the least bit engaging. The movie is long and boring. Period.
4,Nice but small,"Arrived in 2 days and looks great. The pockets on the inside were too small for my 2013 Toyota 4Runner's manual, but it fits nicely in the middle with the zipper closed."
3,It works.,"This works well enough. Personally, I don't feel there is a reason to market something like this and say it's specifically for cars because we had so many similar folders while growing up and going to school. But it works well enough."
3,So-so,"I was hoping my Prius owner's manual would fit into one of the sleeves. But... didn't work out. The owner's manual does fit in the open area which I can zip up, but not a fan of things not ""nailed"" down. Wouldn't recommend for Prius owners if they are looking for a secure fit."
1,The BIG Mistake,"The XAM MTEL General Science guide was the worst investment in my teaching career. There were almost no questions that matched up to actual MTEL General Science Test and the science review test provided in the booklet. The examples in the guide are way too simplified and do not come close to the majority of the question on the 2008 General Science Exam. Like some othes have stated, save your money and either take a review course or invest in some other books. This book isn't worth the paper it is printed on...."
5,Brass Corners,I do woodworking. I used to buy these corners at local hardware. Now I cannot find them locally. These are exactly what I needed. They arrived promptly when they were supposed to & the price was very reasonable.I was very pleased overall.
2,"Chiles were nice, package is AWFUL","I enjoyed the variety of chiles, but the canister is pure hell. You can't even break into the thing. Even though the habanero and chipotle flakes were awesome, I'll never buy anything again in this ridiculous canister. To get a tablespoon of flakes, I had to pound the canister on a newspaper on my counter. I probably spent five minutes on the task."
4,Beautifully made,"Of course, le creuset has excellent quality: this adorable little ramekin is perfect for service a warm dessert or side dish. Or 1 serving of soup."
3,"chewy, no sugar added but somehow tasted too sweet","The package says Apricot Coconut -- the coconut is really pretty impossible to taste. Which is fine for those who aren't really into coconut (people such as myself). I expect that this is pretty healthy, but it's essentially dried fruit (specifically, dates and apricots) combined together and smushed into a rectangular shape. Cashew pieces are too small to really add to the flavor or texture of the bar."
5,Amazing,"Can this girl get any better? It is a cd & dvd combo pack and it is great. The dvd footage and the cd to accompany it. I wish more artists would put out a matching cd when they do their live dvd's.Great Job, Sara!"
4,"ask me, do i love it . . .","I adore Brown's work in general. She has an amazing mind and a charismatic way with words. Those of you who love her fiction first and foremost may not appreciate her poetry though, it is absolutely in a different voice then that in which her prose is written. But, as a poet, and from a poetry standpoint - it is concise, moving, and still very much the Rita we know and love. Definitely worth a read - mine is beat-up, dog-eared and very well travelled."
5,Loved It,"It was a great series, had a lil bit of everything and recommend it to everyone. A look into the life of certain actors"
2,"Nice try, but Medallion was better....","I was an avid fan of the show while on the air and in syndication. As such, I was tremendously excited to purchase the complete series as this would allow me to enjoy all my favorite episodes at my leisure.I was not able to enjoy my favorite episodes at my leisure for the following reasons:1) the quality of the DVDs is horrible! The background noise and ambient sounds in almost all the scenes drown the main characters' dialogues. You can't follow the story if you can't hear the characters speak!!2) the story telling was full of mistakes when you are able to watch episodes back to back. This was a big distraction from truly being able to enjoy each season in its entirety.If you need your fix of Vinny and the boys, I would watch the show on syndication to have a more pleasurable experience than purchasing this box set."
3,"This book was for review, but there was a lot of writing in hte book -- much more than expected or normal","The item satisfied my needs and arrived quickly and in good shape - however I was unhappy with the condition - had I known about the amount of writing etc in the book, I would not have bought it"
5,Great Product,"Great peanut butter/chocolate taste. Sugar free. Wonderful, protein-rich in-between meal snack/meal replacement. This is perfect for fitness enthusiasts and body builders."
1,The bars are stale!,"I received my Chunky Peanut Butter thinkThin bars a few days ago, and brought one to work for lunch. When I unwrapped the bar, the chocolate coating was crumbling and white. Yuck."
2,Poor Taste (and not fresh),"Amazon clearly has stacks of these just sitting around at a warehouse for months! These bars were chalky, so they tasted old. Besides that though, I don't know how much I would've like these bars anyway. I mean I love anything peanut butter, but these bars just didn't cut it. They tasted like cardboard. Sure, the box I got was old, but I can't imagine the taste being much better when fresh. Allow me to suggest a couple of other bars that I do like, 'pure protein' bars or my favorite 'supreme protein' bars."
3,Tastes OK,"The bars make for a nice snack and they taste ""natural"" but are not something that I would eat for pleasure."
2,They were melted and the chocolate had turned white,"We love these bars but i won't order them shipped from anywhere anymore. They came melted, white, and didn't taste as good as they do when they are fresh."
2,has a very sweet and awful taste,"I think to be honest, most of the protein bars do not taste good at all. If they are, then they have quite many bad stuff in their ingredients. This bar taste fairly better than lot many but I would still never buy it again. All that being said I'm going to finish my current order that I received. I eat it when I'm too late for my evening snack and I've nothing else to grab."
5,"High protein, no refined sugar, delicious!","Great source of protein. Absolutely delicious flavor and especially, texture. Love that, unlike other protein bars is is not hard as a rock or taffy-like.Great for anyone who is concerned about blood sugar levels avoiding spikes and sudden drops. And no sacrificing flavor and real pleasure in eating.These are great."
3,Not a great taste but good for you,I ordered these on a Subscribe and Save special because I liked the high protein content and most of the reviews had a positive message about the taste. I am generally a fan of Peanut Butter flavored things but not these. They remind me of old school powerbar taste and texture. The taste is not very peanut butter. The texture is pretty dry and grainy too. You will definitely want to drink a full glass of liquid with these. They are also very dense and heavy.Part of the reason why I might not be happy with mine is it looks like the bars got hot at some time. The chocolate on the outside is melted to the package pretty badly. I ordered mine and they sat on my doorstep for a few hours in 95+ heat. I dont really blame this on Amazon its just what happens when ordering online.
2,Ehhhhh.... Not that great....,I ended giving these to my husband simply because the calories were 240!!!!!!! I also didn't care for the taste.. I would rather have a real scoop of peanut butter than an artificial flavor taste any day.. and the search goes on.....
1,forget this one!,"the taste is very chalky and disappointing! Love others in this line, but this one is in serious need of a redo!"
1,buying these from Amazon,I love the bars themselves and found them less expensive through Amazon so ecided to buy them. I opened the first bar and notices the chocolate covering was whitish (signify the emulsifiers are breaking down) I bit into it it was nasty tasting like something that was very out of date and stale. My best guess is improper storange with Amazon or during shipping extreme heat) I did contact Amazon and they did refund my money on these (well let's see the next statement). I never shopped for food on line so was a bit leary now more leary.
2,Dry but not revolting,"I typically buyBalance Bar Complete Nutrition Energy Bar, Peanut Butter - 15 Countbut I wanted to try something else and Amazon had a sale going on for the thinkThin Protein Bar so I got the chunky peanut butter version. I was very disappointed, the bars did not have any type of creamy texture that you get from peanut butter. I had issues actually swallowing a bite from the bar. I needed to drink a glass of water while I ate to even finish it. The taste of the bar was okay at best, I mean it faded after a few moments probably due to the massive amount of water it took to finish it. The bar did have little chunks of peanuts so that was pleasing but other then that it just wasn't very good. I wanted to like this but I don't so I can't recommend this item to anyone who is just looking for a quick bite in bar form that isn't a candy variety."
1,Tastes like medicine,These were on sale at a local health store. I couldn't finish one. They taste like a vitamin tablet not food. Yucky !
1,Taste terrible and didn't help me lose weight.,"I bought these in bulk so had no choice but to try them for quite a while before giving up. I just noted that I agreed with review of Ms. Hampton. They are loaded processed peanut and cocoa butter fats, which can't be good. I did not lose any weight but gained. It wasn't until I switched to a rice protein drink that I lost and I know it was the bars because I didn't make any other changes but to substitute the bars for the rice drinks.I also tried all the flavors but none tastes good. I will not be making any more orders of these bars."
1,"They LOOK amazing, but taste horrible!","When you first open them up, they look wonderful - like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. They smell great too - I was expecting to be in utter heaven when biting in. However, the aftertaste is pretty awful - almost chemically. There's only a very minor peanut flavor about them at all. I don't recommend them."
3,WHY GLUTEN FREE,"A bit pasty and hard to swallow. Not close to what a Cliff bar tastes like.White sugar is bad; good riddance, but what's wrong with wheat?"
3,Good but not enough fiber for me,"I wasn't really dissapointed with the taste of this bar. It was tasty enough considering it is a low sugar bar. It does taste like peanut butter, but has a somewhat strong after taste that I don't get from Clif builder bars.I was shocked that this bar only contains 1 gram of fiber. They can do better than that! Most bars, even protein bars have way more fiber than that.I am not sure if I will purchase these again. I also wanted to mention that I was shocked when I found that Whole Foods (usually expensive) sells these by the box for about $2.00 less per box, and that is their regular price, not a sale price."
2,Don't waste your money,"It's only plus is the 20 grams of protein. The bars are smaller than most bars, and they have a very bland taste - even the different flavors all taste about the same. A much better choice is the Clif Protein bars, which also have 20gms of protein but are larger and taste great."
5,Gluten free protein bar,They are very tasty and high in energy. I really do like them and I have placed them on my automatic shipping to always have them on hand.
5,"After the first 3 bars, they taste great!","When I first tried these bars, I thought they were horrible. However, I hate wasting money, so I ate a few more. Today I am ordering my fourth box in 3 months! I am on a diet and they have become my treat for the day (since I am on a diet anything with chocolate always taste good). I use them for breakfast or a quick lunch and they keep me full for about 3 hours."
1,arrived stale and ugly,"I wasted my money on this product. I opened the box as soon as it arrived and sampled a bar. It was stale and the coating was chalky. I'm going back to buying ""Pure Protein"" bars."
1,Don't buy these bars from Amazon,ThinkThin are great bars. Amazon delivers either stale bars or bars that have been left in a hot warehouse. I used to take delivery monthly -- no more! The last 2 shipments were bars that were so dry that they crumbled when the package was open. I cancelled my standing order.
1,These bars were stale and tasted horrible! I threw them away.,I normally purchase this item in stores but thought I would add to my first Amazon order.I was happy to see you offered them.Clearly they wer old and stale and should not have been offered.
3,Great Product but don't buy it here,These are the best protein bars that I've ever eaten. It's a huge plus that no sugar is added and they are gluten free. LOVE THEM. I've purchased them twice from Amazon and was very disappointed (both times) in the condition of the product. The chocolate looked dull and old like they had been in Grandma's freezer for too long. Further the taste and texture were also a bit off. My 4 and 5 year old boys love these. They will split one before a soccer game or a mid afternoon snack. My advice is to buy them elsewhere and you will be pleased.
1,Tastes Like Paper,"Yuck. The headline says it all -- this tastes like paper. Its bland, chalky and gross. I don't know why it's called ""chunky"" peanut butter, since it has zero texture. And I eat tons of high-protein bars, so this isn't a general reaction to the unique taste of whey protein or protein bars. It's a specific reaction to this one."
2,They have a funny aftertaste.,"I do not care for the taste and aftertaste to these, however, I do like the idea of being able to enjoy them."
4,Pretty Good,"The taste is pretty good, not great. They do fill me up when I am hungry and on the go and do not want to eat bad fast food."
2,Meh. Not overly excited by this product,"When I first saw the reviews for this product, I got very excited and purchased two boxes. When I got them, I was disappointed to realize that at least part of the protein was from soy -- in general I tend to stay away from unfermented soy products -- and I found the taste rather meh. They weren't awful but overall, I don't think I'll buy them again."
5,Think Thin bars,I love peanut butter! This bar tastes like a candy bar without the sugar side effects and lots of protein to keep you full!I eat as a meal replacement or when I feel the urge to cheat with sugar products. Awesome product!
5,great taste,"Great taste , even for a guy who doesn't like peanut butter. This could be the perfect protein bar ."
1,stale,The chocolate coating on the bar has turned white and the bars were stale!! Always get these bars and love the product but will never get from here again!
3,"OK, but no replacement for Clif","I decided to try these when Clif peanut butter bars and Zbars were unavailable. The chocolate coating on the thinkThin bar makes it seem too much like a candy bar -- and it's messy if the temperature goes up at all. The flavor's o.k., but the texture of the inside stuff is mushy. I'll be glad to have Clif back in a few months."
5,A great tasting protein bar...,"I actually have these protein bars on subscription because I enjoyed them so much and the price was right.I usually eat one before going for a run, and I'm still not getting sick of the taste at all. They are no candy bar by any means, but they still taste great in my opinion. They aren't too big (which is great if you are going to run and don't want to have a full stomach) and they pack 20g of protein...Bottom line: If you want a candy bar, go buy a candy bar. If you want a great tasting protein bar (by protein bar standards) then this is a solid choice."
1,"Really, Really, Bad","These are really, really, bad. I got them as a lightening deal and wouldn't encourage anyone to buy these. As a previous reviewer stated, they have a terrible chemical taste to them. I'm really disappointed in these. Save your money and buy EAS, Balance, or any other power bar but this brand. I mean, they are just awful."
2,Think Thin bars,"I love the bars, and have ordered them from Amazon several times before. I have opened one of 2 boxes and the bars appear to be old. The chocolate coating is discolored and crumby."
1,really tastes bad,"Tastes really bad. A strong Chemical after taste.zero grams sugar, but still products tastes sweet -- loaded with chemicals and artifical sweetnersone bite and it fills your stomach. A bloaty feeling just after a couple of bites.a definete NO-NO for any one 12 and younger. But also not recommended averse to eating food with unnaturnal ingrediants.Since Amazon does not accept return of grocery items - I had to trash the product."
1,Bars arrived chalky and old,"I love think thin bars and eat them almost daily. These bars had arrived in poor condition, very stale and old tasting, with a chalky substance on the outside. Would not buy again"
2,Mediocre,"These bars are huge, with good texture and very filling. The taste is mediocre (a bit fake). Overall, they'd be fine if it weren't for all the sugar alcohols.... all ELEVEN grams of them. That much maltitol tends to mess with digestion. I'd go with a different bar, if it's going to be a regular in your diet."
2,GMO free?,"I am very concerned that this product does not state anywhere whether the soy used in it (couple of ingredients are derived from soy) is GMO free? From my understanding, over 80% of soy and corn seeds is genetically modified, so chances are that soy from this product is modified which would NOT make it a healthy product at all!"
2,"Taste fine, but they're old","I love think thin bars, but these were old and the chocolate had bloomed when I received these. Go to the store and buy them there. They cost a little more that way, but it's better than eating crumbly old bars."
4,thinkThin Protein bar,I got these bars in the peanut butter flavor because they were cheaper than what I could buy them for in the store. Not really low fat but has a good protein content. Seems to fill you up for a few hours and it's healthier than a candy bar.
2,Taste is Sub-par,"I decided to give these a try after being practically addicted to the peanut butter clif builder bars - I wanted to see if I like something else more ... and it turns out I was extremely disappointed with the taste of these bars. Actually, not only was the taste sub-par, but I did NOT like the consistency either when compared to the more firm clif builder bars. Won't be buying these again."
2,Not great,"I liked it at first, then started to taste like cardboard. I like the dark chocolate better, but Atkins Advantage chocolate chip oatmeal is best."
2,flavor has changed,I just opened my latest order and it appears the recipe has changed. I can't taste the peanut butter and it tastes to sweet.
2,Good if this is what you are looking for,"I'm just tired of the handheld found footage genre. It needs a rest. This starts off decent but delves into another genre that is getting tired: the torture genre. If you still aren't tired if these two genres, then you could do a lot worse. This film delivers what is expected with nudity and violence. I'm just ready for something different in the low budget horror world."
3,Sob story found footage film,"Sob story found footage film. Now we see that the lead character is in real need of financial help since we learn early on she has no insurance for her sick daughter and as we all know this is a real life situation for many parents and as with this young lady there is no daddy in the picture to help out or rich grandparents . She comes up with the lame idea of some show were she might win $20.000 , hold your breath on that one. Amelia's (Marieh Delfino) BFF talks her into being a stripper for easy money and now we are off to the house of pain. After a slow start we get to the torture porn or what ever this is were Amelia is held hostage and is being forced to face her hoeing ways. There is a bunch of B.S. about saving there souls by the mad doctor (Graham McTavish). Michael Rooker has a small part as the hit man for the Mad doc.Good ending and I like the after the credits added part, look for it."
4,Bridget's Review,My husband and I watched this movie the other night and it was excessively creepy. The plot and the acting was great. The psycho freaked me out - majorly! I was glued to the TV the whole time. It's definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen.
5,Great tools/price,"Not too much to day. I am very pleased. Great price and quality. I will suggest to anyone, and I assure you I am a customer for life unless they fail on quality in the future."
5,Excellent!,"Great, high quality sockets. I've seen lots of hex sockets; I've used even more. GearWrench makes professional tools for the professional of professionals. I've seen this product sold for three times as much as the price you will find at Amazon. Buy from Amazon, and save money."
1,Not great,"MAny issues with this item, as it replaced one that was working ok but had a dull blade.Motor speed fluctuates, on-off switch turns itself on and off..."
1,cut my poor dog's face,I bought it to trim around my dogs ears and face because the ad said it was quieter. It knicked an area near my dog's eyes and I didn't notice until the next day when it scabbed up. Won't use it anymore!!!!!!!
4,Two-Step 101,"We don't have a dancing background but we are having fun learning the basic two step, and the other transitions included in the training: the Basket (or Wrap), the Promenade (with side step and vine step), the One and a Half Torque Turn, and Sweet Heart (side by side). Currently planning on purchasing additional training DVD's by Shawn."
4,Interesting Movie,"We got this movie because it was the one that put Merchant-Ivory on the map, so to speak. It was interesting and well made. The fact that it was based on a real British family theatrical group who toured India made it even better. The teenage daughter's performance was really good. It was a little hard to understand with the various accents and there were no English subtitles. Reading the pamphlet that came with the DVD before watching the movie helped a lot to understand what was going on and what the symbolism was. It might not be for everyone, but we were glad we bought it."
1,Not a one-size-fits all solution!,"The product indicates that it fits all diameter closet rods. Not true! Does not fit on my standard wood closet rod. It will not fit on anything with a diameter larger than 1.25 inches; if your closet rod is bigger than this, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT as it will not fit on your closet rod.The instructions are poorly written, most likely due to poor translation. The hooks that connect the top piece (over the top of the rod) to the bottom piece (the large motorized unit) are small and flimsy and difficult to align properly."
1,Tie Rack Weight Problem,"I purchased this tie rack about a year ago. After placing 40 ties the casement with the batteries and tie pins broke free. Why? The arms connecting the top unit securely to the bottom casement are made of thin plastic. The plastic can not support the weight of the seventy ties, no way!Save your money and purchase another system as I now have to do."
4,Convenience and Selection,If you are a person or know a person who wears ties to work this tie rack is a must! It holds so many you can actually color organize them. The light is bright enough to help out with picking the right match for your suit or shirt and the motor runs at a speed that lets you decide which one and pick it off without stress. My only complaint is that the knobs that hold it onto the clothes rod were almost too tall to allow the unit to fit under the shelf. It was a tight fit.
2,Didn't last,"This is made of relatively cheap plastic. Two of the 5 plastic tabs from which the housing hangs broke off when tightening the unit onto the bar, so I had to jury-rig it to keep it working. Today the motor just up and died. It lasted only two years."
3,disappointed and confused,"I found out about this movie a few months ago while on one of my musical safari's i got a copy of its sound track and loved it but didn't get to see the movie until yesterday. I was extremely disappointed in the movie, not the quality of the acting or the cinematography but the plot of this movie seemed to go nowhere and there where just so many unexplained points that it just really just left one looking at the clock at the end and wondering what in the hell just happened to the last hour and a halfish of the night (don't remember exact run time). after this one might wonder why my review is still 3 stars well this is because of the a fore mentioned saving graces (i.e. acting and cinematography) along with my love of the soundtrack. All in all id say get the music and either skip the movie or watch it on netflix."
1,Don't buy it,Tried for 3 hours to make it fit to my 1973 model 94. The product is cheap and unuseable. Save your money.
5,Ron Kenoly; Lift Him Up Video,Video tape was in great condition. It is a delight to have this once again. My original copy was damaged in a storm. Its great to have it again and with such great quality; even the case was in good shape.Ceeco
2,Not impressed,From the time that i received this item the case would not close and swings open as you walk. I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.
2,Pro Sport Medicine Dual Action Neo Knee Support Brace,I had to return this product because it was too large. I still haven'tseen the replacement yet.
5,A Fantastic Nut-Free Granola - Eat up! You Won't Be Sorry!,"Every City Grits Granola you try is sure to please. This stuff is simply amazing - I have tried all flavors and LOVE all of them. Orchard is fresh and filled with fruit. This particular one is completely fantastic in that it somehow tastes hearty yet doesn't have nuts. I never felt unsatisfied eating it - never missed the nuts.Top picks are the PB&J and Berry; other favorites are Peach Pecan and Cherry Cashew. The Pineapple Ginger is good and unique - especially if you dig ginger. If you live in Seattle, hit the Fremont Sunday Market for samples galore from the very kind local owners/couple - salt of the earth folks who really just want to make a great product for us all to enjoy!"
5,Kids' pick of the year!,"My kids love the Xiaolin Showdown cartoon and play-act the ""shen-gong-wu"" challenges. When they got this game for Christmas, they immediately ignored thier other favorite games for a month! I am not a gamer and can give no real review myself, but my kids love it!"
3,Not what I expected,Kind of early in the game but I thought that they would battle mortal kombat style except in kid version. There is a battle for king of the hill and kung fu tag. The kids seem to like it but I find it boring. There seems to be other games in it which I haven't gotten to see as yet. If you kid is a fan of the cartoon I would still recommend it.
2,Ok Funk Music,"Detroit's One Way was a funk formed in 1979 by Al Hudson. They experienced some success on the r&b charts in the 80's scoring a few top ten hits including ""Cutie Pie"", ""Mr. Groove"" and ""Lady You Are"". ""Cutie Pie"" has real good pumping beat and is their best song. Much of the rest of their songs sound derivative of better funk from the time"
5,Brass robe hook,These hooks have been it place on an outside shower for two years. They look as good now as they did when I put them up.
2,I Am So Jinxed!,"Vick Marotti's social evolution has placed her at least on the fringes of popularity now that she's dating one of the popular guys, Gio Carson. She no longer needs to pretend to be a witch, but perhaps some of her faux hexes are rebounding on her as she is filled with doubts and fears. Is Gio cheating on her? She knows he's lying about something, there's another guy who interests her, and a host of other problems make her feel like someone under a curse, not someone handing out curses.** Unfortunately, there is very little plot to hold one's interest. Characters are flat and shallow, making it hard to care about what happens to them. **Amanda Killgore"
4,Great Set,This set is bright and colourful. A good starter set for your little bible beginner !Easy to sit down with at bedtime for that final story and cuddle.
2,The catastrophe that didn't happen.,"The author predicted a worldwide economic crisis after the first oil shock, for the simple reason that the oil producing countries couldn't spend the money surplus they collected after the drastic increase of the oil price. That would lead to a worldwide depression. It was not to be.We now know what happened. They gave the money to the US banks, who (Walter Wriston) lent it to different countries, for in his opinion a country could not go bankrupt. But those countries couldn't repay their debt and provoked a first round of bank mergers with a loss of thousands of jobs.Good information on the Herstatt bankruptcy.Only for historians."
2,Sequoia/tundra manual,Missing some important steps when taking the door panel off. That is all I have used it for thus far.
1,Not as advertised!,"The website says it is for Sony DSC-W1/5/7, but when I received the adapter it is marked as adapter for DSC-W5 or 7. Not marked for W1 - it would not fit my camera!"
4,Buzz lightyear Inflatable Jet Pack,"My son loves this jet pack. A lot of fun for the money. The elastic straps did, however, pull off from the wings, but a simple safety pin did the trick."
1,"Leaky, smelly piece of junk","As soon as I opened it out of the packaging, the plastic reeked terribly. Once we got over the smell and tried to inflate it, we realized that it had a leak which kept getting bigger. The seams are very flimsy. My 4 year old son has been talking about dressing up as Buzz for Halloween and insisted on the jet pack. He's going to be so disappointed when I tell him that it doesn't work. This toxic piece of junk is headed straight for the landfill unfortunately, unless I can somehow return it for a refund. Would definitely not recommend this accessory. Wish I'd paid more attention to the reviews (which I usually do) before ordering it."
3,Blow-up jetpack ONLY. NOT full costume.,"I now realize the detailed description, at the very end of it, states that the costume itself is sold separately, but I certainly didn't get that until after it arrived. This is ONLY the blow-up jetpack. :(The main, bullet-pointed description, and the main photo is misleading!"
2,Potent off-gasing!!!,"OK, so any Buzz Lightyear costume HAS TO HAVE THIS!! Very cute! But get your gas masks ready and some advil. This thing stinks like nothing I've smelled before. I received this today and immediately took it out of the package to air out. I've worked with industrial plastics and this should require PPE and OASHA air quality testing. It sat opened and unfolded (but not yet inflated) for 4 hours. TO air out, because I know these things can have an odor. Its now been inflated for an hour and MY WHOLE HOUSE SMELLS LIKE VINYL!!! I am not kidding. My head is pounding and I think I have the munchies.We have a Halloween Party to go to on Friday night. Today is Monday, if I do not deem this safe for my 3 year old by then it will go into the trash.But it is holding air and is super cute. Will update this review again if it gets worn."
3,Very nice costume,"Very nice costume, My 4th year old son, enjoy it. It fits well with the sizes that appears on the web."
2,Poor quality,"My son liked it as part of his costume, but this is just an inflatable. Unfortunately we will have to return it. It doesn't have any obvious leaks, but it doesn't hold air very long. After an hour or so, it is fully deflated."
4,Fun,"Bought this to complete my sons costume. Was a bit scared, being plastic blow up wings, but they still hold up. The only thing, the straps to hold them up tore off after a couple of months, but we somehow still make em work. My son has so much fun with them."
5,soooo adorable!,this arrived quickly. I actually bought two the first one had a slow leaking hole but did not want to hassel with a return. i ordered another for my sons birthday cuz he loved it so much and this one has lasted us. My son loves it how ever he does knock down almost everything when he wears them but he never wants to take them off.
4,Basic,For the price it was great and served the purpose. It's very basic but light weight which made it great for trick-or-treat.
5,2 yr olds Mom,"I found the Buzz Lightyear Costume on Clearance for $5 at Target, what a bargain...well, plus shipping which was about same. But didn't realize it didn't come with the Jet Pack, which my 2.5 yr old son pointed out was the reason he couldn't say ""To Infinity & Beyond"". So we found the Jetpack around the same $5 range, after 2 separate shipping cost, added up to just under $20...but he has been flying all around the house since. I hope it last for Halloween! It's Blow up but as good a quality as the pool floats...I'm very pleased with the purchase."
2,Great fun while it lasts but it doesn't last long,We've had three of these and each one would last at the most 2 months - easily puncture unfortunately.
3,very cute but not durable,This was a great addition to my sons costume but he didnt even get to wear it for 20 minutes before it started to deflate on its own. It would have been much better if it was made out of a plush material instead of being inflatable.
4,Great Addition to Costume,The wings were just what we expected and really made our son's Buzz Lightyear costume look that much better.
1,grrrrrr!,"it dosent look to be inflatable but it is and way over pricws for a claw machine toy.Buzz Lightyear Jet Pack,One Size Child"
2,Constantly Leaks,"Our son was so excited to have a set of wings, but these only stay inflated for a few minutes at at time. We put them under water to determine where the leak was and found THREE separate leaks. Poor quality."
5,exactly what I needed.,These wings were perfect for my 2 year old for Halloween. They were soo cute and held up just fine.
2,Way too pricey for the cheap plastic material used,"This product cannot hold its ""wings"" shape for long. My son is all excited, but it does not impress me. Not worth what I paid. I am going to keep it because there is no other choice/option available (that's life, I guess)It needs some hard-material in the frame somewhere. Expecting the air pressure alone to keep the shape is a bit too optimistic."
3,Buzz,"It was ok for the money, when I opened the box and saw it I thought I could have gotten this from the dollar store."
4,My Son loves it.,"The rating I feel is fitting I liked it, my son enjoys it.The straps could be have little more grip to hold it on.I bought it for my 2 Yr. old, He enjoyed playing with it more than wearing it so I thought it was useful in many ways so kids 2 up I recommend this product for."
5,Perfect,These wings were perfect for the buzz lightyear costume!! It went perfect and my son loved them!! The buzz costume wasn't complete without these wings!!
3,My 4 year old LOVES his wings!,I had to adhere clear packing tape to the holes where the THIN elastic straps fit through to prevent the holes ripping. Other than that my 4 year old has been wearing his wings everyday for a week. He loves them more than any toy right now.
1,Poor quality,The toy came deflated and folded in a plastic bag. When opened the toy was stuck together and when we tried ti unfold it and open it up it was completely stuck. When pulling it apart it pulled all the paint and colors off. It looks horrible. I don't recommend this product
2,Didn't realize item is inflatable,"The picture makes the item look a lot better than it is. The ""wings"" aren't awful, but only the ""pack"" has an opening to blow air into. The wings don't, and they don't look as full as in the picture because of that."
3,"Son loves the wings, but straps break fast :(","My son was so excited to put these on and on the first day, he wore them till bedtime! The only bummer is that the elastic straps broke on the second day (the plastic loop they are attached to is what actually tore, not the elastic itself). Wish I would have known because I would have hid it till Halloween. Not sure if they will hold up another week to be worn with his costume :)"
4,buzz,"is a product of excellent quality and durability, I recommend to fill the demands and expectations required by my very good"
2,Not really that great,"Pros: Cute, lightweightCons: Cheaply madeThe elastic and velcro straps that attach the wings to your child are small and caused the jetpack to be very tight to my 3 yr olds body. Because the jetpack is inflatable, it you blow it up all the way, the center between the wings gets very rounded and made the jetpack keep slipping up my sons body and hitting him in the head. He didn't enjoy wearing it very long to say the least."
5,well worth it,i bought this to enhance my sons halloween costume. he absolutely loves it. we were told over and over how awesome his wings were and no one had seen anything like it. he wore it all night and it is still usable.
2,Leaked!!,The pack formed a leak in the first 20 minutes. My daughter had one wing flying during trick-o-treating. Very disappointed with this product!!
2,Not worth the price,"My son insisted on having these wings to go along with his buzz lightyear costume. I thought that $12.95 seemed a bit high for inflatable wings, but it's a Disney product, hence the markup. Unfortuantely, I had to use a piece of tape to hold down the piece that you blow air into, as it kept popping out. Very disappointing."
2,Buzz wings,"Although the design is true to Buzz and was received with initial enthusiasm and delight, this item doesn't hold air very well and the elastic shoulder straps are awkward causing the wings to sit very high on the back of the neck. Got about 2 afternoons of play and went in the closet (flat)."
3,Great toy terrible quality,"My son was very excited to get this ""rocket pack"" but, after 3 days it sprung 2 leaks and we have been unable to plug up the holes with super glue. Pretty disappointing."
2,Lasts a short while,"I bought this for a toddler, so you can imagine how often it gets played with... It's inflatable!!! That means, in the hands of a toddler, it lasted almost a week after Christmas. There is a small tear or hole somewhere, so we keep having to blow more air into it. The elastic ""straps"" broke the very afternoon of Christmas day! We had to be creative in order for our son to be able to get some extra time with it. I don't expect it to last much longer.Just wish we had paid more attention to the fact that it was inflatable when we were shopping."
2,Had to return,"This product is a good idea, but the inflatable wings would not hold air. The air plug would not stay put once it was fully inflated. I also didn't realize it was inflatable-I suppose I didn't read the description well enough, but I was disappointed with the product overall."
4,bueno,"La mercancia es de buena calidad, y llego a tiempo segun lo establecido en el sistema. Lo recomiendo ... Venezuela"
2,Not worth it,The wings are just blown up like a pool toy. I thought they were going to be made of pillow type material. They look great with the costume but I am not sure how long they are going to last without getting a hole in them. It is not worth the $9.00 extra on top of the price of the costume itself. It should not be more than $5.00 at the most. Don't get it.
4,Pretty good.,"It's worth what you pay for it. The center of the pack and the L-shaped frame of the wings inflate. The main surface of the pack is just a layer of plastic. It's a cute backpack, but I did notice the stem to inflate pops out on ours. It's not a big deal, you just have to blow it up again. My son loves it with his costume and it really finishes off the whole Buzz look. If you want something your child can really play with for a long time, then buy the non-inflatable one. This one is fine, but it's not made to last that long."
2,Fun for a few days,my son loved the jet pack but on of the straps broke within a few days of play wish it would have lasted longer
1,Don't waste your money,"The first time I put this on my grandson, it broke. The straps are little pieces of elastic that are not attached very well. I was able to knot them back on, but this only lasted for a few more wearings.It's a great idea but needs some work to make it kid user durable."
5,Kids love it.,My kids love this. It's pretty easy to inflate and they just put it on and BAMM the fun begins.
3,It depends on your ultimate goal!,"This product is supposed to make your hair grow faster? I haven't seen conclusive evidence of that. It stops the shedding of already dead hair , I haven't seen evidence of that either.I am African American and have a red scalp with a big flaky area that is agrravated by use of this product once a week. I also now have dark spots on areas of my scalp.I was told to use this by my doctor, I am sure she had me use it intermittenly with other products because of these side affects . It is a product that feels good and tingly but I have not seen it give me tremendous growth . I have used it for a little less than 2 months."
4,itaila t-shirt and sweat shirt,I was happy with the quality of these items but they do run very small. The exchange policy is very simple and the online customer service rep. was very helpful when I needed information on how to exchange my orders. I would order from Amazon.com in the future.
5,Highly Recommended,"If desk space is at a premium, this is a great choice. I had no problems hooking it up and installing it. The picture quality is excellent, so long as you run it at maximum resolution. The crispness of text actually exceeded my expectations. LCD's certainly have drawbacks (costliness included), but if you're in the market for a 17"" model, I haven't seen a better monitor at this price."
1,Proof that low price does not mean good value,"An unfortunately case of stylish monitor is no better than its vanity looks. Seven dead pixels on arrival, unresponsive controls, washed out colors (and no black!), and an general feeling of cheapness. Definitely stay away if you make a living as a graphic artist."
5,Reviewing 171v so be patient,"I purchased a model that is very similar to this one....it's the 171v. I'm new to flat screen LCD monitors so I'm not into all of the techno-hype. I just know I love this monitor! The clarity is unreal. It replaced a ""regular"" 17"" monitor and it's very nice how true the measurements are when you switch to this type of monitor. I can't tell you how easy it is to use while adjusting, but I can say it was easy to install. I just plugged it in.One note...change the size of your display to make it clearer. When it's as large as it was during the ""default"" stage, it was blurry and I was concerned. That simple adjustment made my swimming fish a bit more clear."
3,"nice monitor, but flickers and screen colors fade","I got this monitor and after a few days i noticed the colors fade sometimes, almost how my old 15 inch crt monitor used to flicker. is this normal?other than that the monitor is very easy to use and sets up well and has a nice picture. I have never had a lcd monitor before so I am not sure if this fading of the colors is normal or not. I tried to return it on Amazon and it told me that their system is down right now for this service.If all lcd's are like this I might just return this and get a 15 inch lcd since they are twice as inexpensive."
5,Good watch,Very good looking watch. Thick leather strap good for a man. Not dainty at all. And works just as a watch should.
5,Self Healing Reiki... Worked for me....,"I have read the book, and watched the video... I am very please with the results from this book. I live in Nashville, and moved from the West coast a couple of years ago. I still have friends that want me to do an attunement over the phone, or thru web cam. I have had success doing attunements long distance, This book, combined with the video is an excellent tool, to give the most novice individual the knowledge, and technique to receive a viable attunement. I would reccomend this book to anybody who is interested in Reiki, and how it can & will work for you."
3,Useful,Came across commonly known facts regarding Reiki as well as a few less-know facts . Interesting book to read .
2,you will get what you pay for,"I am a reiki junkie/Master-Teacher, though I consider reiki MY tool for self-development. I bought this book and sold it as soon as I read it once. Why? There are many books that have come out now that are superb and give you better/correct information. Diane Stein is still the best. If you want to learn something right, get the right materials. This one is not it, however well-written it is. Reiki has its roots in the East and when a student learns healing or a mantra in the East, a Guru is an essential part of the dynamic. Anything else is cheating yourself of the experience and the lesson. There are free teachers available. Ask and you shall receive, although payment is only an exchange of energy, since all things in yoga have to be in balance. You may have an ""experience"" when you watch a video, but that is not it folks. When you get attuned, get the real thing. Money is not everything, the experience is."
1,Attunements by reading a book? ...... I don't think so!,"I am an Independant, Teaching, Reiki Master with more than five years of practical healing and teaching experience.Do not be decieved..... by buying a book and/or a video you CANNOT be attuned to Reiki Energy on ANY level. To be attuned you need to be in the physical presence of a Reiki Master ( able to touch them) and have a ""one-on-one"" attunement process.What you WILL get from reading this book is more understanding about Reiki healing and the chance to decide for yourself, without pressure, wether you want to look for healing from a practitioner or perhaps find a teacher to learn more about Reiki.What ever you decide to do, may you find the way that is right and true for you."
5,my favorite reiki book,"i really enjoyed this book a lot. it feels like barbara is discussing reiki with me personally. the book is down to earth, very informative. i also have two of the videos barbara offers, but so far i've only played one. it was great, i could feel the energy flow. if it were not for this book, i doubt that i'd have searched deeper into this healing method. now i want to go as far as i can in this field. thanks to barbara."
4,good stepping stone,"I liked that it offers the option of a ""Home Attunement."" It was the first of its kind that I've seen to offer video courses along with its book... although, the video is not as accessible- you can't really by it in stores and I'm not sure if it comes in DVD format, as others I've come across.I DEFINETLY recomend this book to those who have time to order and watch the vids. I know it can bennefit many."
1,Negative one (-1),One word DEPRESSING i mean the ending thats where you say the 5 miuntes of action if you can call it that
1,Not that great a movie,"I was sucked in by the DVD box. Possibly the worst movie I've ever rented. For those of you who kind of liked it, more power to you :)I seemed like a high school media arts production. Needless to say my ears were assaulted by the fake accents. I'm sure some of the budget would have been better spent getting acting lessons for the ""actors"". I couldn't even get through the first 30mins. I shut if off after that point."
1,"Utterly terrible as far as ""vampire movies"" go","I rented this expecting a mildly entertaining vampire/horror movie. The box artwork and description sure made it sound interesting. It tries to be a combination of ""Blade"" and ""The Matrix"" at once and fails miserably on both goals.Very poorly executed in almost every possible way. It was apparently shot on a similar Sony digital camera system that Lucas used on the last Star Wars movie. But the picture on this film is only decent and looks quite fake and bright. In other words, it looks as if it was shot on digital video. Why they even bothered with that amazes me since this was obviously a very low-budget movie to begin with. The sound is also very poorly done, i could not even understand most of the dialogue throughout the film. We are talking about a very rough sound mix.Even a really bad Troma movie is Godly compared to this piece of cinematic garbage! Too bad there isn't a 0 rating on here."
1,This is as bad as it can get!,"For a pure definition of bad, this film is it. Bad acting, bad storylines, bad everything. I sat and watched this movie and was awestruck that producers actually put money to this film. No wonder hollywood is getting bankrupt!!This film is the one too rent/buy if the unwanted guest is coming round for a visit, guaranteed they will be gone in the first 10 minutes maximum."
3,ok so I like some B-movies...,"and this is one of the Bs that I liked. Ok, I'm a sucker (pardon the pun) for vamp flixs and novels (jeanclaude from anita blake is among my top 3 fave vamps). When I saw the movie at a local BB, I decided to give it a try. Well, the accents kindof gave it away that its not american, and that dude's supposed Texan/Ark/LA/MS accent made me laugh at times. not because its cheezy, but yes I actually know people who talk like that. The low budget was apparent from the beginning, the storyline wasnt top notch, but I thought it was a pretty decent B-movie. I just wish that the ending had a better way of closing the movie and not left me hanging with the 'what if'. If you want 'typical hollywood' boring vamps rent Interview with a vampire. If you're into the B's give Reign a rental try."
2,You haven't seen many movies if you call this the worst,"The movie is bad... poorly acted... storyline is nothing new of course... There is something to be said for the cinematography, it's not standard b grade... it's actually pretty good... but yes... unless you're like me and willing to spend an hour and a half on watching a pointless movie that gives little or no gratification, by all means, rent it or buy it... To call this the worst movie ever is unfair... it's not entertaining enough to be the worst movie ever..."
3,Para todo el Mundo/For the whole World,"Written & produced by Mexican Juan Gabriel, this was Isabel's second recording since her come back. Great instrumentation, though a bit poor in lyrics. I would stay with the track ""Cuantos Dias Mas"" cause this is how Isabel should sound.//Producido por el Mejicano Juan Gabriel, esta fue la segunda grabacion de Isabel desde su vuelta a los ecsenarios. Excelente instrumentacion, aunque un poco pobre en letras. Me quedo con el tema ""Cuantos Dias Mas"", porque asi es como Isabel suena de verdad."
4,I love singing to this cd!,"Isabel Pantoja has some voice and I love singing along. Listened to this one many times the summer of 1997 while driving in Spain. But, I left it there so I had to get another."
5,Delicious Melodrama!,"D.W. Griffith's wonderful historical melodrama can keep viewers on the edge of their seats just as masterfully as it did nearly a century ago. The Gish sisters are spectacular, as are the supporting players, sets and costumes. Too bad the DVD version offers no additional features, but at least the movie itself will provide 2 hours of delicious melodrama."
4,Great for a silent movie,"I haven't seen a great many silent movies, but this one seems much better than average. The production values are high and Lillian Gish looks hot. I like her better than Mary Picford. This movie interested me because I'm a francophile. The sets of old Paris were pretty good. I couldn't tell for sure if they were real or fake."
4,Old but still useful,Technical publication written for taxonomists still usefull. Text and photos helpfull in identifying Annona species.
4,Another good book,"I enjoy stories where the main characters fell in love in their youth. Even though it was one sided, it's touching when you see the other grow up and accept them for all their flaws because that is who they are. The only complaint I have is that I read all three of Ms. Lee's series in three days and saw a little too much repitition through them. In fact, all three men seem to have the same exact fantasy come true when they wed. I won't tell you what it is and the author did it in a tasteful way (I'm not into overblown sensuality), but the scene seemed to have been taken from her first book and cut and pasted into the other two. So if you've read the other two, take a break and read another book before you pick this one up."
2,Very forgettable book,"I won't bother with the synopsis (not only because I don't remember the entire story after just having put it down a couple hours ago) but because many other reviewers are much better at it.My only comments are, if the author had focused on the characters and not went on and on about decoding messages, spies, etc. this book could have been a lot better. As it is I had to force myself to read it. Also, I was so sick of Sarah chasing after Jarrod I wanted to scream. Not to mention the end...Jarrod all of a sudden realized what he had??? Please! I gave it 2 stars because I was able to finish it."
2,MissSue,"So you you really think the new rector is going to kick the supposed betrothed of his new living's patron out on the curb????I rather think ingratiating brown-nosing would have been the order of the day. Was rector going to say ""Just kidding!"" when dispaced waif returnde to the parish as the lady of the manor? And if ex-lover of philandering uncle was so kindly disposed to his widow, then why attempt to lure the niece into prostitution in the first place. She claimed to have known the connection between her past protector and the girl when she saves the day by preventing the evil viscount fron dueling with the hero. This book makes no sense."
4,I'm enjoying this series very much,"This book was very nice indeed. I LOVE Jarred. What a sweet boy he was, but he was turned into a scarred man...rescued by love. Sigh. The preview had me on pins and needles waiting for the book to be released, and I wasn't disappointed.Sarah is headstrong, wearing her heart on her sleeve. Only when she realizes that she loves in vain, that he'll never be able to love her back, to marry, does he realize his love/need for her.Delicious romance on so many levels. I can't wait for Daniel and Miranda, who are excellent secondary characters here. 4 and 1/2 stars, and I'm tempted to give it 5."
3,Clever use of pumpkins as characters,"""Dr. Pompo's Nose"" cleverly uses real pumpkins as the characters, but I felt that the rhyming text was forced and akward to read. However, the range of expressions on the pumpkins' faces are amazing and fun to look at. Although I liked this book, I would recommend ""How Are You Peeling"" by the same authors more."
3,Disney Stylin' Princesses (Dolls),"My granddaughter loved seeing a styling face she was familiar with; however, had I seen the size of the head, I wouldn't bought it. The generic heads are bigger - thus easier to handle, less expensive and more realisitic. As long as there is a pictures of a child's favorite character around (like a poster or an inexpensive product)go for variety and get more band for the buck. After all, it's not all about brand."
1,Should be classified DEFECTIVE,"Arrived and returned the next day. This unit is 100% unreliable, only picking up voltage ""once in a while"" until in direct contact with a live COPPER wire. Inside the breaker box, it would sound 1 of 10 times while on the main 220v feed into the house! Live NM wire...good luck!DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
3,Good back up,I have a klien that was twice the price of this and i ordered this one to have a back up and extra on the job site. It certainly feels less heavy duty then the klien but does work.all in all if you you don't plan to use it all the time this product is a great price and will probably last under diy or homowner use. not for a contractor.
2,Doesn't work!!,"I bought this item for a small electrical job at home, I can't believe Amazon sells this type of junk, not only it is cheaply made but is also dangerous to use, it does not work most of the time. My advise; go to home depot and buy a 10 dollar one. They are nice hefty and durable unlike this piece of...."
1,Should Have Paid $10 More For A Better One,"I'm having to purchase a replacement for the ""Reliance Volt Snooper"" since the red plastic nose cap keeps coming off. Tape helps, but the cap is spring loaded and eventually works it's way out. Also, very rarely will it pick up current without direct contact. Trust another brand!"
2,"OK, but poor sensitivity","So it does what it claims. What it does not say, how poor the sensitivity is. It's usable, but just barely. I don't think it's really worth the money. It works better with 220V than 110. Put next to a live insulated wire it will chirp an light. However, if testing a wall socket, forget it. The socket's live metal parts are just too far back to activate it."
4,"the fortune telling book/ crystal balls, tea leaves,cards",another good guide from gillian kemp. with hints of wiccan and romany crafts. this author never fails to impress for the beginner and practitioner.
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"I have always wanted a sweet small book that explained several fortune telling techniques in a 'simple' & 'understandable' manner. This book is it!! It's small, adorable and complete for the novice. It's unfortunate amazon no longer carries it. The contents: crystal ball reading, hydromancy, apple divinations, playing cards-cartomancy, candle majic, dice, marriage folklore, tea leaves, bay leaf. Absolutely everything is to the point and well presented. It is so easy to apply. It feels majical holding this beautiful little book. Lovely and talky as the author writes in after thoughts by hand. It also gives the history of playing cards (description of every card and spread) and dice (ditto). It's full of tidbits of knowledge to apply immediately - no heavy study and not so complex it ends up on your shelf. All inclusive and wonderful! A big thank you to the author!"
5,"Great, Great, Great","This book is great, love the pages the simple writing and the handwritting in it adds just the right feel."
4,Excellent Satire,"This is one of the best written comedies I have seen in a while. Not only does Thank You For Smoking owe a lot to Christopher Buckley for writing the novel it is based on, it owes a lot to Aaron Eckhart who was a perfectly cast lead in this movie. I'd always enjoyed his work as a character actor in the past, and this role gave him a chance to show his leading man capabilities.The rest of the cast does really well for the most part with some good characters to play. Just like with Batman Begins, Katie Holmes is probably the weakest link in an ensemble of veteran pros. The dialogue is sharp and quirky at times. Overall, some smart subtle jokes.The movie never gets preachy on the issue of cigarettes to where it takes a side. The real message here is to educate people and let them decide for themselves, and to think for yourself. I'm not a smoker, but all I can say is, whether you agree or disagree with smoking laws, that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this."
4,Thank You For Smoking,"Nick Naylor (Eckhart) works for the Academy of Tobacco Studies as a spin doctor. He is their primary weapon in defense of Big Tobacco, and that is not an easy job. Bribing the cancer stricken Marlboro Man (Elliot), making smoking sexy in movies, and spinning an expose about him are all on his agenda. Through it all, he has to baby sit his son (Bright) and show him what dad does for a living.""Thank You For Smoking"" is a funny, edgy movie. Aaron Eckhart is perfect as the somewhat soulless Naylor. His reasoning will make you cringe, but he is hard to argue with. The supporting cast is star studded, and all the actors do a solid job. Those on both sides of the smoking issue can enjoy this movie as well, and that is perhaps the most impressive trick that the movie pulls off. If you are looking for a thought provoking, funny movie, this one is for you."
5,Most accurate lobbying movie to date,"Laughed out loud the whole way through, and made me want to join the MOD Squad!"
2,Meh,"The trailer looked like this movie had a ton of opportunity with such morally bankrupt characters for a serious laugh, hypocrisy and deep questions, but the script isn't all that good. The acting is fine (except for the kid who just doesn't sound like a kid) and strangely Rob Lowe's character is the most interesting one in the whole movie. I was too disappointed to enjoy it."
3,A bit over-played,"Perhaps my expectations were too high but it was not nearly as funny as I was expecting it to be. At first the story was funny but then it was like an old joke that keeps getting repeated until it is too worn out to be funny any longer. A good idea, perhaps, but not quite as good as I had expected or as good as it might have been. Still, it was good for a mild chuckle from time to time."
2,Read the book.,"In comparison to the book, this movie takes out some of the more quirky, sharp, and unique parts of the plot. The portions of the plot that it keeps, and often adapts into some kind of Disney channel outloook, leave much to be desired. The alternate ending is drab and unwittingly abrupt, contrary to the book. Even when not being compared to the book, there is an alarmingly miniscule amount of character development and the acting is poor. They basically took the book and crammed it into an episode of ""Friends""."
4,Good film.,"I really wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.I had heard about it for years but I still wasn't entirely sure what it was about.Was it a comedy or a documentary style movie?It turned out to be a very dark comedy.A somewhat unrealistic comedy but still a good one.Aaron Eckhart is the big tobacco lobbyist who is trying to convince the government and the public that smoking isn't bad for you.He's divorced, and pretty much a dirt bag.That said the movie has excellent acting.Pacing is spot on.Pretty much everything was done well.I recommend a rental."
1,Never got out of 1st gear,I watched the first half of it and since it's 1am I decided that I would trade the other half for an hours sleep. I guess it was kind of a good example of how lobbying works and it could have been a pretty good show.There was just virtually no exciting moments to it just kind of drags along.
2,"weak satire, no one in the movie even smokes.","can a movie satire about a murderous industry that kills thousands of people every year be pleasant? this movie is. it's basically a lite comedy with no real bite. the actors are all good and the story's mildly amusing but no one in the movie is ever seen smoking. a satire about the tobacco industry and no one is smoking! i didn't read the novel the movie's based on, so i don't know if it's stronger but this movie's very weak and disappointing. you might almost think the tobacco industry was composed of decent people. everybody lies right? is that the message of this movie? the tobacco industry has knowingly killed millions of its customers. how funny or amusing is that?"
2,"Slick, Arrogant, Stale, Nanny State Non Sense","The Eckhart character is deliberately hobbled and stereotyped as a debater in order to make the ridiculous and shrill nanny staters look dignified and credible when they are not. A high school debator could have made a better promotion. For example, like so many involved in statist leftist causes designed to limit individual freedom, there is a refusal to learn anything about the marketplace and how it works-mainly out of an absolute abhorrence of capitalism. Big tobacco is Big, for instance, because they sell products people want. It is nearly impossible to create a need rather than meet it. This is why tobacoo companies now sell smoking cessation aids, etc.I can just hear the comments coming in, so BTW, championing freedom and allowing that adults like to make their own choices is not ""whining.""This movie just reeks of a truly repellent smug self-consciousness that feels instantly overwrought and tired. Note: you can't be funny and politically correct."
4,I would give it 5 stars but....,"I love satire. I love this film. But like all the arguments about smoking it always shows the same main two #1.smoking is bad and they lie about it causing cancer. #2 Tobacco defends its self and denies. For ME I don't smoke becuase i don't want to die. My argument I'd like to see in a movie is that NO ONE GIVES THE TOBACCO COMPANIES THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. If you as a company can find ways to make people kill themselves and pay you for it, YOU ARE A GENIUS. I love it, respect it, defend it, and a film that can take a bunch of idiots and their stupid arguments an put funny spins on both of them is held in high regard. This film is a slap to both parties and gives you good laugh"
3,Hypocritical,"Clever tale of libertarianism from Peter Thiel, the PayPal guy. In the story, our hero Aaron Eckhart lives a lie so that he can pay his mortgage, he goes through a series of challenges, and comes out on top the way you'd see in any Tom Cruise movie, the main difference is that this one happens to be starring Aaron Eckhart instead of Mr Couch Jumper.Sure, it seems to be a thinking man's movie, but why would a movie about smoking not show anybody smoking? Why would a movie about the right of the tabacco industry to exist suppress smoking in it? Why would a movie that shows the main character going to Hollywood to convince studio executives to feature its stars lighting up, but then not have its star light up? Somehow the film, while enjoyable, is not clever enough to answer any of these questions. Rob Lowe is good as a serene Hollywood guru-type, but William H. Macy horribly typecast as a snivelling senator who is exposed with ridiculous ease as a hypocrite."
5,Spin - loved it,"The story itself is interesting. It is a satirical look at political activism and advertising today which it calls spin. The hero is a spokesman for Big Tobacco, who tries to push cigarettes by claiming that it is the rights of smokers.I also found the different characters interesting. Overall they came together well. Much of the acting was good. Not surprising as some were very good. In particular I did like Aaron E. Eckhart performance!Some of the stuff was a bit over the top but it is a movie.I also liked some of the logic, examples and methods of argument used."
4,The spin starts here,"This movie is really about spin. The tobacco industry is used to showcase how PR can make anything, even a lethal product, acceptable to the public. The insane thing is that you find yourself cheering for the spinmeister himself! A great cast including Katie Holmes in a sexy, hilarious role that makes you wonder why she has settled for being Mrs. Tom Cruise. Robert Duvall is terrific as the tobacco exec who falls victim to his own product. Highly recommended!"
4,"Sharp and funny, but...","I saw this opening weekend in New York to an absolutely packed and enthusiastic audience. Mostly, I loved it, but as a fan of Christopher Buckley's book, I really missed the fact that much of the main plot (much more interesting than the overschmaltzy father-son storyline it was replaced with)was completely gone. There are quite a few great twists and turns I was looking forward to seeing, and was very dissapointed that they were not there (especially since they would have rotated around J.K. Simmons' wonderful performance). Still, the movie has plenty of bite and is very hillarious, so I'd reccomend it to most people."
4,"Spin is the message, not anti-tobacco","You might mistake this for an anti-smoking propaganda movie, and there is just a little of that. But this is really about modern spin and how it's taken over every issue in society, making it difficult to filter out fact from fiction. This is unexpectedly entertaining."
3,Could be better.,"I have seen this movie four times including one in cinema in Tokyo. I have also read the novel. Pro is that there are no smoking scene in this movie. Con is the end is too simplistic and changed for the benefit of tobacco industry. As a whole , I like this movie, though."
3,"Clever, but slightly drab","This one's worth a rental just for the scenes involving Congress and the lobbyists interactions with his son. There are a few funny moments, but it seems like they could trim it down to an hour and stick it on HBO. Hard to rate higher than 3 stars due to several points of utter boredom when nothing is happening at all. Some interesting arguments are touched on about the hypocrisy of the governments stance on tobacco and the lobbyists response. There's also a sprinkling of dark humor, but there's too much wasted time in my opinion. 3.5 stars on a good day"
4,Thank You for Smoking - Review,Interesting movie about ethics and communication. Loved that I was able to view several times within a 24 hr time period.
5,Very Clever!,"This is a great upbeat comedy. Aaron Eckhart was the perfect choice to portray Nick Naylor, the smooth talking tobacco lobbyist. There are plenty of reviews to read and gather the plot elements and I will not bore you with another list. Simply take my word for it: if you like smart, clever comedy, then you will enjoy this film. And I love the part about the Merchants of Death: ""My company loves the idea, they want to put it on bumper stickers!"""
3,Interesting,"Very smart, funny and interesting movie. I seldom say that about any movie. The story of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry who's job is to put a spin on cigarettes, improve their image, make them cool again, and prevent one senator from getting legislature to mandate that cigarette companies place a large graphic skull and cross bones on each pack sold.Nick Naylors character is brilliant. While he was ""selling"" the public on his ideas and views and convincing them, his own son, and everyone else that he is correct he actually sold me too with his good looks, charm, and logic.Everyone knows that smoking causes cancer and anyone who attempts to sell or promote it won't garner any sympathy for lagging sales. That's where the spin doctor Nick comes in to teach everyone that smoking is cool.Excellent movie."
4,"Good movie, packaging lacking","The movie is great, but don't expect it to come in that pretty red box. It doesn't look like the special edition in the picture."
5,Thank you for Thank You for Smoking,This is a truly great movie for anyone interested in 'spin' - both how to do it and how to understand it. Not too bad on verbal Judo either.
5,Good movie that shows a different perspective,Aaron Eckhart does a great job as a lobbyist. A clever comedy that leaves you to think for yourself and not follow the herd.
4,Far better than I expected,I was prepared to sit down to a long diatribe on the evils of the tobacco industry and was pleasantly surprised ( and quite ashamed of myself for being so judgmental in advance) to find a funny compelling story of a father's effort to get through this world of contradiction and raise a son. I certainly recommend this film for an evening of fun viewing.
4,Smart satire,"This satirical look at tobacco lobbying really hit the mark. Smart script, great acting, believable characters, sharp humor. Cannot figure out why it took me so long to get around to watching it!!!"
2,A Disappointment,"To be honest, I bought this movie to see more of Katie Holmes' acting since the last I saw of her was in ""President's Daughter"", which I did like immensley. I was very disappointed in this movie - not only because it had very few scenes with Katie in them, but because it seemed to ""wander"" without a firm ground for plot or for the characters themselves. I lost interest a fourth of the way into the picture and never regained it."
1,Smoking....,"because it is on fire in my backyard! Sorry, not into the feel angry because the tobacco companies are making a lot of money! When hollywood stops producing movies glamourizing thugs and drug dealing maybe then they should start trying to convict others of their bad decisions. Until then just keep your opinion to yourself! Junk movie!"
3,3 and 1/2 stars,"Although the title implies that this movie is soley an attack on the tobacco industry, it's really a hit at lobbyists and spin specialists in general. The focus of the movie is the art of forming your argument so that you are always right. Stephen Colbert has created a term for this idea: ""truthiness"".Aaron Eckhart portrays tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor as a very human guy who understands that he ""gets paid to talk."" He justifies his job to himself (and his son) and explains that we ""all have to pay the mortgage"". The entire cast performs well in this film, aside from Adam Brody, who's turn as Rob Lowe's ""yes man"" is stiff and unfunny.While Thank You For Smoking is enjoyable and well-done satire, the story starts to run a bit long and in the end I think an hour and a half of The Colbert Report would provide more biting satire for this particular topic."
1,Would have been great,The DVD gets stuck at certain scenes throughout the movie. It doesn't play on the computer or in a DVD player. It would have been a great DVD. It even had 1 scene that was not on the VHS version.
1,Defective Discs for All,"I'm just chiming in with the other reviews because my disc is also defective, and in just the same way described by the others. Apparently this problem is across the board, so the best we can hope for is a recall. This is a new, boutique label and I'm hoping they don't go bankrupt first."
2,"If you like Helmut Berger, it's for you...","The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the looks of Helmut Berger. He's 26 years old at the time, and after seeing him in many Visconti's films, it's interesting to watch how he performs here. Obviously, without a great director, the movie did not realy happen - Dorian's girlfiend is being played poorly, for example. This movie is rather a curiosity, but Berger is at the pick of his beauty."
3,A-Z survey of RC Ship modeling lacks detail,"The book presents an overview of RC merchant ship modeling. While the book may be useful for orienting a beginning modeler in the right direction, those that are looking for solid tips and ideas for a particular project will come up lacking.The color photo on the dust jacket is great. Unfortunately all the photos inside are black and white.I found the chapter describing hull building to be particualry disappointing. The text was not clear and the diagrams weak.The author is British and cites products and supplies using British trade names. There is no glossary to help US readers find suitable American equivalents."
5,"Narcotic, in a way","I first purchased Astral Weeks about 15 years ago, when it started showing up on critics' lists of the best albums in rock history. The descriptions that drew me to it -- words like ""unique"" and ""unconventional"" -- turned out to be both right on the mark and woefully inadequate.Even the word ""masterpiece"" doesn't work. Try ""transcendence.""I've always felt that you have to listen to this album all at once. It is most definitely a suite; a ride through a strange, twisted neighborhood, and your tourguide is a very observant but slightly disturbed Irish guy. This album definitely takes you somewhere else, and when it's over, the good feeling usually lingers for a while. In that way, it's sort of like an audio narcotic. Shoot this in your ears and get ready to take a ride."
5,"The best Van album, unsurpassed beauty","I must admit that I haven't heard every single Van album (I missed hearing a lot of his earlier albums), but this is the best I heard--better than Moondance, Wavelength, and all his newer stuff. Moondance is commonly listed as Van's best, and it is a great album and more readily accessible. And it might take a couple spins to appreciate it, but the listener who takes the time will be MUCH more rewarded by Astral Weeks. A few years ago I picked up Astral and Moon at the same time and Moon hardly gets spun. For my money it pales in comparison.Moondance was obviously Vans labor of love. He produced it and enlisted some two dozen musicians, and it is very well produced. But a big part of the beauty of Astral Weeks is its simple production. Van went into the studio, laid down the album in 2-3 days with 4 or 5 musicians, and it was done...and the magic comes through."
4,"Ah, some of the astral-Celtic sound","It's hard to think of Van as an introverted mystic, but this is where it all started. Yea, he had a first life as a Belfast bluesman and some time on Bang records when he produced one of the great pop singles of all timee, but this documents Van's summer of guitar. If you don't study this album, you're not a Van fan. As a matter of fact, find it on vinyl and digest it in twenty minute doses of mysticism.Essential."
5,A poet sings,"First the LP then the CD, now the upload. The music remains relevant and compelling.When Amazon put this album download on sale for under$2, I could not resist."
5,Van Morrison shows he is a musical genuis,A classic album and of the most underated and underappreciated album of all-time. Hard to believe it was not a big seller. The muscianship is impeccable on this album and every note has meaning. THis album grabs you emotionally and won't let you go. In fact it is not a pop album at all but really a Jazz album and a great jazz album at that. A must album to listen to. A real gem.
5,Amazing!,One of the best albums of all time and a remastered version as well. Too bad that we have to for a japanese import for a good remaster.
3,COAL,"The album should be admired for ""sweet thing"", and ""cypress avenue"". Van sounds like a young man looking for direction. Van was able to get the wheels in motion and develop a sense of style ,upon completing ""ASTRAL WEEKS"". This is his coal before the diamond."
2,Suckered by the reviews,"Lester Bangs' essay on ""Astral Weeks"" is one of the greatest pieces of writing (music criticism or otherwise) I've read, and of course after reading it I had to hear the album. Other critics have similarly gushed its praises, as many of the reviewers have here.Every year I read that essay and return to Astral Weeks to hear what I *must* be missing. And the answer is always the same: beats me. This makes pleasant background music, but every nice hooky moment is offset by the overall meandering sprawl. In any event, I know that you're going to have to hear this thing - maybe on my deathbed it's virtues will come to me as an epiphany."
2,What's so great about this album?,"After reading all the 5 star reviews on this page I thought for sure this would be a great CD. So I went out and bought it, put it in my CD player and listened to it, and I wasn't impressed. Then I thought well maybe if I listen to it a few more times I might like it.....perhaps it's just one of those albums that grows on you. So I kept listening to it, and every time I came to the exact same conclusion that this album is mediocre at best. I know everyone disagrees with me but oh well, I think this CD sucks."
2,Overrated,"In 1968, Van Morrison, teamed with a collection of local jazz musicians and spent two days in a New York City recording studio to record Astral Weeks. The lack of time invested in the project and the jazz section's unfamiliarity with Morrison and rock music are fairly evident. The tracks, eight of them taking up forty-seven minutes, start out mildly pretty but sprawl out for a generous multitude of time with little development. Occasionally Morrison's brawny vocals will rise up and draw in the musical pap bacl from dullness, but never enough to save blatherers like ""Madame George,"" ""Ballerina"" and ""Beside You."" The spring-ish title song and the passionate ""The Way Young Lovers Do"" are Astral Week's only thoroughly enjoyable moments. Morrison's lyrics are vastly overrated. They are occasionally sweet, but too predictably sentimental to be very striking. This overrated album sounds like what might have been a mildly enjoyable work stuck in its earliest, roughest demo stages."
3,Moondance is musically superior,"Van Morrison recorded this album in the span of only a few short days, and it shows. Most of the songs are extremely repetitive and too long, and the album overall doesn't have the same polish as the far superior Moondance. Despite these flaws, the album is very poetic and has some good moments. It is also a very soothing album, which makes it a good choice to listen to while traveling or doing work."
2,early Van Morrison,"My son-in-law and I are both fans of Van Morrison, so after reading a review of his earlier 'Astral Weeks' I purchased a CD for each of us. I did not like it much but my son-in-law loves it."
1,The emperors new clothes,"I know this is considered a ""classic"" and one of the ""best albums of all time"" but I find it ultimately annoying. I bought into the hype when I first purchased it but I gradually came to realize that I couldn't stand it. The overly lengthy songs and vocal ""improvisations"" drove me batty. Morrison's vocal mannerisms are highly repetitive. He seems to have a few signature vocal ""licks"" that he uses again and again and again... This album killed any budding interest I had in Van Morrison. Best left for the retirement set."
2,A ho-hum album,"I was already a fan of Van from his Moondance album (which I rank among the top 10% of all classic rock albums I own) when I picked up Astral Weeks ... But after giving it several chances I've found nothing special about it.The music conveys a languid mood that shifts back and forth between blues and jazz. That's good, but there's nothing novel in the arrangement and there are no standout performances. The music's simply adequate. Same with the lyrics. They don't reach out to themes of social consciouness, fire the imagination with evocations of time and place, or touch upon fundamental truths of the human experience. The best lyricists of the late 60s and early 70s did this. Morrison achieves it on Moondance. On Astral Weeks one track (Like Young Lovers Do) comes close, but the rest are just someone singing. Without anything special happening musically or lyrically, the album is simply mediocre...."
2,what the ...?,"The customary juxtaposition of the existential with the metaphysical may lead one to believe there is more going on here than the VanMan improvising for 45m on a few of his favorite themes. Yaaahuuuhmmm, alright. But its only wordjams, uhhuh. Laaaymedowowowown, jammin with words yaaahuh, yeah. Astral weeks is however a very pretty title. Woyeahuh. How much weed do you have to smoke to 'get' this album? Aaaaaon, on the radio, rayray rayray, raaaaaodio. Alright."
2,I don't like it,I consider Moondance to be one of the greatest LP's ever made. There are plenty of folks who love Astral Weeks. But I do not. I don't like one song on it. So there.
1,It's just boring,"""Astral weeks"" is a record that many praise and call a masterpiece. In my opinion it's just a boring experience from the beginning to the end. The songs are way to long and they seem to never end. I'm thinking about selling my copy.If you're curious of Van Morrison, you should buy ""Moondance"" and ""Tupelo honey"" insread - two much better albums, all aspects included."
5,This is Beautiful...,"This is the perfect album to lisen to if you yust whant to relax and feel good. put it on and lay yourself on your bed close your eyes and yust float away in to a dream land, it works for me and I am shure it will work for anybody, a true beautiful masterpiece."
5,It's all been said,"This album, every song, has been reviewed to death. The title song is outstanding but most of what Van does is outstanding. I have read reviews of this album over the years. Most speak of the bluesy soul wrenching songs Cyprus Avenue and Madam George. These are wonderful songs. But, I'm a romantic. I could listen to Sweet Thing and The Way Young Lovers Do, forever. More importandly, although we own more than 20 Van Morrison albums, the three that are played repeatedly are Astril Weeks, The Best of Van Morrison Volume 2, and Poetic Champions. This is a ""must have"" CD."
3,Overrated. Van has better albums.,"I was always puzzled why many think this is Van's best album. Yes, it is good--but not great. ""Sweet Thing"" and ""Young Lovers Do"" are the only classics on this record, others are OK but nothing special compared to tunes on some of his other albums. I much prefer ""Moondance"", ""His Band & The Street Choir"" or maybe ""Too Long in Exile."" Go Van!"
4,Some underrepresented greats on here.,"Overall the album is great. The first three songs are terrific and I'm not sure why I had never heard them before on the radio when I was younger. The rest of the album is still very good, but it is a little repetitive, in that Mr. Morrison has ""vocal solos"" and repeats the same two or three words over and over for what seems like an eternity at times. I'm sure it's artistic some how, but I'm not accustomed to whatever style that is. It can be a little too much to handle at times. I did still buy the album after having listened to the whole album a couple of times on Rhapsody, so it's still very good overall."
5,Great if you are tinking of starting an online business,"This book provides a great interview style discussion with 40 internet entrepreneurs from huge household names such as Ask / AskJeeves down to smaller start ups.The book is a massive 600 odd pages but is certainly not boring as each of the 40 chapters is devoted to interviewing a different internet entrepreneur. Each interview style is completely different so it is like reading 40 short stories.A great book I would recommend to anyone in business, it proves to me there is no one style to win in business as each of the interviewees have a unique style of thier own and this shine through in this book."
4,Great book. I totally agree with the other review,"I totally agree with the other review, this book is a great read.I particularly like the diversity of the interviews. They interview large corparations like Ask Jeeves right down to the guy from SharpMail who earns a resonable income from his site, but is successful and enjoys it none the less.A great book that you can read a couple of chapters, put it down and then read another couple of chapters later without losing your place. Although I found it hard to put down once I started and read it from start to finish."
5,Jabula CD,"We love this CD. The music is great for driving along in the car- the rhythms are the best we've heard.I have two of them, one for the house and one for the car."
4,Good movie,"Good movie, my son loves everything Handy Manny! This movie keeps his attention and he enjoys watching it. Would recommend to anyone."
1,Twisted Straps,"The product looked like it did in the picture. When I tried it on, however, it was a whole different story. Most of the straps were sewn on twisted so they didn't lay flat. This being a clothing product where the main attraction was all the cute strings, was very misleading. I would never buy another product from this place. Also, the elastic in the rear end part was very loose. It made it slip off really easily."
5,Computer Tips that work,"I didn't expect to find many ""hard facts"" and tips in this book but I was surprised to find out how useful it is. I've found answers to so many computer problems. For a beginner or intermediate computer user, this book can be helpful."
2,Underwhelming freestyle fluff,"An extremely obscure freestyle dance diva, Debra Torre is quite a pretty girl, but unfortunately that's about the best thing that can be said here. Substandard singing and unmemorable melodies abound here, and if you think that the track ""Up All Night"" bears more than a passing resemblance to the huge 1986 club hit ""Baby Love"" by Regina, you're not imagining this. The song was in fact penned by Regina Richards (aka Regina), and its similarity to the ever-superior ""Baby Love"" is anything but subtle. Torre's barely-acceptable cover of the Prince song ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"" is probably the best thing here, which is sad, because any artist really should have a signature tune of their own."
4,weedeater,The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. It starts easy and the weight is perfect. Not too heavy and I can control it easily even with an above-knee prosthesis. The line could be a little heavier so I bought the next thickness and have been using that. It works better and doesn't break as easily.The only negative is how long grasses get wrapped around the shaft and jam into it. This could be improved upon.
1,Nothing but problems,"This weed eater didn't even make it one season for me. First of all, the string constantly breaks and the automatic recoil to get more sting out never works. I had to stop and reload the string manually at least 2 times every time I used it.The worst part of this weed eater was starting it. This thing would take at least 10 pulls to get the darn thing going. This actually led to the end of the weed eater. I couldn't get it started as usual so I pulled the string with all my might and it broke off.I'm not fixing it. This thing is a total piece of crap."
3,"A beautiful, well written book BUT strictly for beginners.","Eric Roth is a terrific interior photographer and this book is perfect for the aspiring interior photographer because Eric gives very good advice in approaching a space visually and preparing it, that said from someone who already has his own style i was a little disappointed because i was hoping to get more technical info regarding lighting but this 150+ plus page book only has around 40 pages devoted to lighting and unfortunately these are principles i already know, the rest are devoted to design throries, tips and tricks and the like.If your looking for a more hardcore lighting and technicalbook, this isn't it. If your interested in starting a career in interior photography, this book is an excellent starting point, if your already an experienced shooter of interiors and are looking for more sophisticated technical skill lessons, stay away, get the Steve Bavister book instead, that gives more technical info."
2,Not technical enough.,"Yes, there are some diagrams, but poorly presented relative to other books on lighting. So the ""Lighting"" part of the title is misleading. There is plenty of pontification on theory and ""what makes a good photo"" but not too much on the photo's actual execution. Nothing on long exposure, stops, ratios, etc. So if you want a book on improving your creative eye or how do properly ""art direct"" the room, this book is for you. Don't get me wrong, the guy does great work. It would have been nice to see how."
1,nice photos but average information,This book has some nice photos but has little in the way of technical information on how to create the photos. The descriptions of technique is nebulous and surface skimming at best. For example when there is a photo with a lighting diagram the example photos and the diagrams do not match up. There is also no indications of light ratios when talking about fill lights in the rooms. It is almost a book written by someone who really doesn't want to share there knowledge. If you want to read full of artsy babble about what a photo should feel or what inspires the author then you might enjoy this book.
4,I felt well informed,The author keeps a tight focus on his subject. Lots of good photos to use as models. A wider range of issues covered than I expected. A pleasant breezy style. My only disappointment was that lighting was not given nearly as much coverage as I wanted. It's almost as if that part of the book's subtitle was dropped in at the last moment in recognition that that's what most readers would be after. I enjoyed the book and expect to keep returning to it for tips.
3,Not much more than a coffee table book...,"I was disappointed when I received this book. Although it has many beautifully lit and arranged photos, it doesn't have a lot of educational content. When the author provides diagrams of lighting setups, he accompanies them with a similar or unrelated photo instead of the actual photo he took with that setup. I think showing the actual result photo would establish more credibility and would give the reader more of an impression that the author actually wants to teach them something."
4,"Maybe 5 stars, hard to say","I've always thought that Bjork was just the loveliest lady, but I haven't seen or heard much of her. Yesterday I picked up this book at Barnes and Noble for $4.98, yes that's four ninety-eight, and it is just chock-full of so many pictures and clear tidy text that I am very impressed. It may not be the most in-depth work about her, but it seems fairly accessible, and she is not terribly well-known beyond a certain reputation as being a bit ""out there."" She's an artist, not a commodity like so many musicians, and it's not what we expect, and people forget to look beyond the far-out sound bite or video clip."
2,Christmas to Remember,I was excited to get this Christmas CD since it contained a variety of classical Christmas songs by great artists. I was disappointed with the sound quality though. It needs to be re-mastered. i even played it on my Bose system.
3,Hannibal Lecter writes a cook book,"This book both enthralled me, and gave me the chills. It was much like reading ""The Silence of the Lambs"" from the point of view of Hannibal. You know, ""I HAD to kill the census worker, his liver just went SO WELL with fava beans and chianti.""Reading the other customer reviews, I both loved and hated the book. I could agree with points on both sides. I'm not sure whether this means that it is a truly gifted book, or that I'm really twisted....I'm sure that I would have liked it much more if I had had a knowledge of French or French cuisine. Some of the names of dishes he mentioned in passing would probably have added to the wit of the book if I had known what they were. I can understand what a pate is, but some of the more convoluted dish names had me saying ""What the heck is that?""Well worth the time and effort to read if you can get through the dense and convoluted prose."
2,A psycho killer by any other name . . .,"Yes, the narrator is brilliant. And he is very witty. But his ""secret"" comes clanking out far, far before it is meant to be discovered. And the basic premise of the book, that a psychopath can be cultured and discriminating, is not a novel idea, nor idea enough for a novel. Tiring, cold as ice, and predictable. Listen to ""Murder by Numbers"" by the Police for the same story, but with a better beat and less of your time. All those falsely flattered into admiring the book will certainly boo me from the floor . . ."
1,"Pretentious, wordy, and unreadable","I'm an American who has spent 2 years living in England, and 4 months living in France (plus visiting often), so I did catch the regional allusions. But this book was painful to read (it was a gift so I wanted to finish it). Back to the drawing board, Mr. Lanchester."
2,Bring a thesaurus,"While I don't agree with some other reviewers that the long, rambling prose is unreadable, it does take some effort. No reading this while watching the World Series. I thought it was a slog for the first third of the book, but, spurred by the glowing reviews by the professionals made me continue reading. I found myself looking forward to picking it up.But under no circumstances is it worthy of the stellar reviews professional reviewers gave it. You'll be able to pick up the point midway through if not earlier.I found myself smiling at some points. I thought it was clever and there is no doubt the author is talented. Just needs to be pared down by about a third."
2,Sub-plot/Plot never gets developed,"Though I enjoyed the author's descriptive style and it started with an interesting premise, my desire to read this book came to a grinding halt when the sub-plot entered the story and was never developed. I would have been more interested to read about his life as a killer, than to read the never ending descriptions in parentheses. I just became frustrated and had to force myself to finish the book.An excellent idea that didn't quite hit the mark. It hasn't turned me off his work forever though, and I'll probably pick up his next book and see how it compares to his first attempt."
3,Tour of the senses,"The Debt to Pleasure is John Lanchester's first novel. He uses the ingenious conceit of a gourmet recipe book - some of the writing in here is splendid epicurian commentary on the pleasures of food. The style and narrator ape the high art - Nabokovian, almost, the author trying to turn his life into an art form. Lanchester falls short of Nabokovian standards (he is English, after all), but the scholarship and Francophile references, similar to the other great Francophile author of recent decades, Julian Barnes, are impressive.The plot, which slowly infuses into the narrative, like drizzles of the finest truffle oil, is perhaps a little strained and lacking in profound impact. But certainly Tarquin Winot: epicurian, snob, traveller, is revealed to be much more than the self indulgent gourmand he seems to be at the beginning."
5,Confirms my beliefs about Iceberg Lettuce...,"I read this book over a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a wicked, hilarious camp masterpiece and I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions. I agree with the other reviewers that the outcome of the novel is apparent very early on but that did not bother me one bit. The enjoyment I took away from this book was in reading Tarquin's tangental diatribes on just about everything. This is a very quotable book. My favorite portion has to be his musings on the preparation of a salad and the banality of Iceberg Lettuce. Cooks will love this book."
5,Delicious and Evil,"I love this book! The narrator's character is captured perfectly in the style of writing, so that as the plot unfolds (oh, so gradually), I was not so much surprised by the twists as awed by the sheer perversity of thought, word, and deed. This is one of the few books I will re-read many times."
5,Delicious!,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't find this book to be too wordy or difficult to read, but then I've traveled extensively in both England and France and have studied gourmet cooking, so maybe I have an advantage in this area. I thought Debt to Pleasure was simply delicious, a sheer delight. A character study par excellence. John Lanchester reveals his character's true personality little by little, delighting us more and more with each new piece of information. Sheer genius!"
5,Michoacan's Finest!,"Juan Gabriel has changed the face of mariachi music, and indeed all of Latin popular music, forever.Widely acknowledged by all types of Mexicans, whether they be gay, straight, transnational robber barons to the Mexican corn farmer in Guerrero who grows corn so pure and powerful that you too will understand why some people with overpowering intelligence have worshipped the sun as their god, in a deep and abiding love for his immortal music.Mateo"
4,Pleasant smell,This is a good daytime perfume whose smell is not over powering. Great for work or going to the gym.
5,My son loves this video!,"We have most of the Beginner's Bible series, and this is one of his favorites. I do not believe these videos are intended for toddlers - my son still loves them at six but he really didn't watch them until he was three or four."
1,What were they thinking,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! This video is so bad it doesn't even get a ratting. The narrartor is dull and boaring. The acting is pathetic and the way the story is told is down right bad. My fiffteen month old who usually loves to sit down and whatch christian video was highly annnoyed. He was so not ammused he began to cry. This is deffinatly not for kids. I don't even reccamend it for preeteens or teenagers. It's long boaring, unentertaining, and lacks good music. I rather stick to talking vegetables and puppets (Veggie Tales and Great Bible Adventuures."
5,Funny!,"This is a real nice book, that contains the only script that they didn't want to do (well it is familiar, the just rewrote the ending) And the CD is a nice touch to the book. It contains the radio show ""My Favorite Husband"""
4,Hopping with Oppy,"If you're into the behind the scences of what made Hollywood tick in the 30s, 40s & 50s, this is a tremendous book. From radio to TV, Oppenheimer was involved with it all, and told of the expertise it took to produce a show. I loved the technical jargon, since I've worked in broadcasting most of my career. And I loved the Lucy tidbits, but wished they had been more about specific episodes of ""I Love Lucy."" However, it was a good book about not only Lucy, but another pioneer in TV--Jess Oppenheimer!"
5,Loved this book!!,"As an true lover of Lucy, I found this book to be very enjoyable and it was great to learn the history behind the creation of my absolute favorite show. It was interesting to hear about the days of radio, and what led Jess to TV and the history of his family and I felt I was taken back in time, and with him, from his journey from his youth, to the exciting time in Hollywood and on. There was some surprises as to what else he invented-don't want to give it away!! It was also interestingto get another's perspective on Lucy-and the diva that she was-and how he stood up to her. I highly recommend this to any Lucy admirer..."
5,A must have for a Lucille Ball fan.,"Everything you have ever wanted to know about our favorite show, ""I Love Lucy."" This book covers all aspects of Lucy. A must have for Lucy fan's"
4,It works!,"Showed up a day or 2 ahead of scheduled delivery. Right power-supply for my HP 6000 series. Just wish the cord from the transformer to the computer was a little longer like the original. But, it works, and when I can't find it in any store anymore, that makes it great!!"
3,slow shipment - good working,"i ordered this product on the beginning of the month and didnt get it delivered until the end of the month. Now I do live in Canada, but I have never had problems before ordering from the US. The device it self works fine. It is a lot shorter in length than the original."
1,"Charges, but causes large interference.","Part arrived and properly powers and charges HP zv6000 laptop but causes very harmful interference. When located in the same room as our television, white lines appear on the screen (which immediately disappear when the adapter is unplugged). Cannot use wireless keyboard and mouse in the same room as this adapter, and it even causes interference for our indoor antenna for our television.It works fine as long as you have no other devices in the room you are using it, but when will that really happen?"
1,Power supply gone wrong,When I got the item all was well for about an hour then the power supply over heated and the computer crashed!
2,"Well, it powers the computer - but not much else...","To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from purchasing a generic, no-name power supply unit for my HP laptop. But at the very least - it would be fantastic if it actually charged my damn battery!The unit itself functions perfectly fine as a power cord when anchored to the wall, but the moment the cord is released from the computer - the power is off and the battery completely drained. Bunch of crap if you ask me.For the price, it isn't bad. The normal HP power supply unit is around $80 and this is less than $20. So I like to think I bought just the ""power cord"" portion of the HP unit, but not the ""ability to charge a battery"" portion.Save the money - get the official HP unit."
2,Bad,"The product looks nice. Good bass sound. Recording with the dual tape deck is substandard sound quality. The product stopped working after 6 months of being pampered. There was a 1 year warranty. The factory authorized repair shop couldn't get parts from TEAC, TEAC didn't have parts available. The repair shop became so agitated with TEAC, that the repair shop refused to do business with them. TEAC sent me a refurbished unit, in which the cd player door didn't work properly. Soon the speakers and turntable didn't work properly either. Somethings definitely wrong at TEAC."
2,Fine if you get one that works/This one works perfectly.,Follow-up: This one works perfectly. Would like the ability to control bass/treble independently rather than presets for sound patterns.I purchased one of these 2 years ago and had to return it as the tapes didn't work. I purchased a second one and the tape player worked for about a dozen go rounds. The device then developed other intermitent problems. Not possible to have such thing repaired locally and the cost of shipping it back to Sony in CA along with repair costs are prohibitive so it's in the basement awaiting the next bulk trash pickup.All this said I guess I will buy another one because it does serve it's purpose. I just hope the next one last more than two years.
5,stero,I bought this as a gift for my wife and she likes it very much. She uses it every day. The service and delivery was excellant. I would recomend this to anyone.
3,spending Grandma,"The size is nice for where I needed music, near my kitchen in dinet. The CDs slip off the track too easy and become dislodged...had to remove back to get one out. I don't like the record changer not being automatic as I need to be aware of when the record is finished to change it myself. I haven't tried the tape player yet. Radio is fine."
5,"CONSOLE STEREO, PERFECT","THIS ITEM IS ABOUT AS NEAT AS CAN BE, IT IS LIKE AN ANTIQUE LOOKING SET, BUT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO PLAY THOSE 45S, LPS, ETC, OLD CASSETTES AND CD'S. IT HAS A REMOTE CONTROL, WHICH COMES IN SO HANDY WHEN IN THE KITCHEN OR SITTING ON SOFA, THIS IS THE BEST ITEM YET, SMALL, BUT DOES THE JOB OF A BIG STEREO UNIT. WHICH I HAD, BUT MOVED TO MUCH SMALLER APARTMENT AND NEEDED THE ROOM, THIS TAKES UP HARDLY ANY SPACE, PERFECTION IN MY EYES. I CAN NOW SIT AND ENJOY ALL MY 45S AND LPS AGAIN AND GET GREAT QUALITY SOUND. WHEN I MOVE INTO THE HOUSE, I CAN ADD ON BIGGER SPEAKERS AND REALLY ROCK N ROLL. JUST LOVE THIS SYSTEM. THINK YOU WILL TOO......"
2,stereo,Its a very nice looking system the sound is just really bad there is no exturnal speeker hook up so you have to go through the back and eather sodder or cut throught the speeker wires to hook up better speekers. It took me severl attempts to adjust the needle to keep it from skiping out side of that every thing ealth about the system is really nice and there nothing really wrong with it. Other then the fact to find a stero like you got back in the 70 is never going to happen.
5,Very well illustrated clearly showing valuable benefits,"This was an impressive DVD showing rear and side views, starting with warm up, two persons showing front and rear views simultaneously, clearly and slowly taking one through this style of Tai Chi forms and adding gentle warm up exercises with group and solo efforts. This was so good I plan on getting more in the series."
3,you pay for what you get,"not as solid as the toilet paper holder even though its from the same design line this is more lightweight and doesn't feel as solid however for the price it does the job. Also the anchors that come with this product and all other moen inspiration products are junk, you will need to buy new anchors."
4,"Easy install, looks good","The towel rod is lightweight but still looks substantial. It was very simple to install - including a handy template you could tape into position to facilitate the screw installation. Everything you need to install - brackets, screws and anchors - are nicely packaged into the product. The towel bar looks good, does the job and was a good value for me."
4,Affordable and attractive,"I'm perfectly satisfied with this towel bar. I do agree with another reviewer's comment about the bar making a squeaking sound. It sits kind of loose in the sockets, meaning it spins easily and makes noise. The electrical tape solution works great though, so it's not a big deal."
2,Wrong assembly,"I ordered 2 of these same items. One had the set screw on the bottom of both mounts. The second one (identical) had the set screw- one on the bottom and the other on top. I was unable to access the set screw on the second bar due to an existing medicine cabinet. If I had not ordered 2 of the same orders- I might not have known it was a manufacturer's mistake. Big dissapointment & aggravation in having to repackage and re-ship item back. Will wait to return in case I have to interchange mounts. NICE towel bars, have the 24"" also, just make sure you have the proper mounts- they should have the set screw on the bottom of each side."
2,Poor design. Special tool needed for installation.,"Tiny screws on each mounting bracket require a jewelry screwdriver. And only the one minuscule screw secures the wall bracket to bar mounts on each side. Also, one of the screws was nearly impossible to loosen. Quality is not impressive."
5,Towel Bar,This whole line of Moen products is wonderful. It was very easy to install and I would highly recommend it.
3,It's pretty good,"The only thing is it looks a little bit cheaper than what i found in the actual home depot store. also, i thought i was ordering ""inspritations"" to match what i got at HD but much cheaper on amazon. however, i received ""Preston"" line which looks a little cheaper, but only at a close glance. it worked out for us b/c we were able to swap one O-Ring and have everything within each bathroom match, but our original goal was to have the same ones in the whole house. now granted, no one will probably ever notice even if they were looking for it unless they're in the top 99 percentile of observant. the product itself could be 4 or 5 stars in my book, but out of principle i am not please that they advertised one line, and i was sent another."
4,Does what it advertises,"The quality is good so the bar installed easily and has not slipped or come loose over the last couple of months of regular use. I was initially concerned about the connections, as many products are not machined well enough and start to loosen after a while, but this has held up."
4,Unique Look Inside the Trials,"I didn't know what to expect from this book, but I was very glad I picked it up. It began a little slowly, but gained momentum quickly and soon had me unable to put it down. Dr. Gilbert, the psychologist and diarist, delivers an in-depth and intimate portrayal of the mental make-up of the Nazi's on trial at Nuremberg. I came away from this book feeling as though I had been at Dr. Gilbert's side throughout the trial, speaking to each defendant individually on a daily basis.A real ""fly-on-the-wall"", behind the scenes view of the Nuremberg trials. Highly recommended."
4,Informative,A bit repitious but informative just the same. It has allowed others to gain an insight into the mental condition of the main perpetrators during thier trial and subsequent sentencing. I shows clearly that these terrible people were little more than thugs who used thier new found power to the detrement of millions.
2,not so good,in my opinion this book is not accurate about those nazis and the psychologist is in my opinion too much of an prosecutor compared with the nuremberg interviews from goldensohn this one cannot compare at all even the few images inside the book are pretty bad quality.
3,Hood,"Overall, this costume is ok--the material's not too heavy nor too thin. However, the hood seems a bit small. It could do better with a roomier hood."
2,Too many typo errors,This book has been re-issued many times but obvious errors still exist throughout the book. Come on Guys! Get your act together and correct the errors!
1,outwitting toddlers,i didn't get the book i ordered i got a different one something called within my heart not what i wanted
1,No wonder it never became popular,This bible has chapters in books omitted. This is the worst bible I ever read/heard of. It combines all 3 gospels into one. Mathew mark luke and John are all fused together. Revelation talks about those who take out God's Word he will remove their name from the book of life. I hope these people repented.
3,I wonder did the original beat this!,"In this movie Sylvia Kristel (Emmanuelle) comes to Hong Kong to discover her sexual fantasies. There are enough nude scenes to get your mouth wet but there is always room for improvement. She does some things that will make your eyes open so this is not a terrible movie. I've seen Emmanuelle 4, and it is not good at all so all shoppers and collectors like myself should look at the first versions."
3,Good sequel,In this sequel to Emmanuelle Silvia Kristel returns to the role she made her famous.The sex scenes are good enough to forget the first one but the storyline is so dumb that makes me feel sick.At least is much better than the sequels that go after.
2,The uncut version should have been produced on DVD.,"This rating is not for the movie which is good and every bit what the other reviewers have noted. My beef is with the DVD which is 85 minutes and even shorter than the VHS version which is 92 minutes. Can someone tell me why? If anything, the director's cut should have been produced on DVD. What a disappointment!"
1,This is the short version!!!,"If you're looking for the true erotic masterpiece that people talked to you about or the one you saw somewhere and dying to have in your collection STAY AWAY FROM THIS VERSION!!! This one is cut! And most disturbingly, the actual scenes for which you buy this film are missing!! Forget about it, go find yourself another movie..."
4,"This is a hot movie, without being XXX rated","Perhaps this movie stands out for me, since I saw it as a doubleheader with Emmanuelle I in original movie release. Of the two, it was clearly the more sensual. Yes, there is sex, but clearly there is more sensuality. I have been in S.E.Asia, so I did make a connection (although my time was certainly not like that). The bathhouse scene certainly raises the temperature of the room, and perhaps other things.... This movie certainly captures the time when sex was guiltless and without any health concerns (pre AIDS). This movie certainly is not R rated, but does not have the hard edge that more explicit movies can have. Perhaps one can think of it as how sex could be in a hedonistic environment with no concern of any consequences. This is a good DVD to have in a collection of sensuality."
4,nice escape,"There is something about Kristel, this genre, this era, that I must have a lack of good judgement. Perhaps I can blame it on my adolescence. My utopian sex life would mirror these cheesy videos. Kristel is beatiful, her lovers are too. The soft core sex scenes definitely work for me. This video makes for a great escape from the realities of sexual freedom. There are no jealousies, ugly consequences or ugly people. -- Again, I think that I could be a bit more critical if this movie were made with another actress. I have a soft spot for Kristel in my cynical view of soft porn. All of her Emmanuelle films are fun to watch."
5,Awesome product I never knew existed!,"I stumbled across the existence of alum while I was looking for premium shaving accessories. I had previously only known about styptic pencils for closing nicks and other shaving cuts. Alum works even better and doesn't leave that white residue that is difficult to get off. This doesn't leave any visible residue at all while closing the worst shaving nicks/cuts. It even seems to last longer. But however long it lasts, I will definitely purchase this item again."
3,"Very Cute, work okay","My daughter 4 1/2 loved the appearance of Ariel. She carries her around and likes the barretts too. However the curlers are a little difficult for her. They definitely work though. I have to put the curlers in for her and then she can take them out. Maybe a better gift in another year. It is mainly a cute toy, not really a lot to do with it."
1,useless toy,"I bought this toy for my 6-year-old daughter, thinking she would enjoy brushing and styling its hair. My daughter has very thick, curly hair, so I am used to brushing through twisted and tangled hair each morning. However, directly out of the box I was unable to comb through Ariel's hair. It feels sticky, the comb gets stuck and tangled and the hair ends up pulling out. If I can't do it when it's new, how could my daughter possibly do it. Also, wetting the hair and setting the rollers seems like a drag. Maybe a much older child could handle it, but by then they aren't really into Ariel anymore. I wish I could figure out how to throw this toy away without upsetting my daughter, but I just don't know what else to do with it. It's useless!"
2,Thhis was a suggestion when ordered an play dress up knight set,I really did not enjoy this book the pictures where wonderful but I did not like or really understand the reasoning of the story.
1,My son cried.,"My four-year old son was so disappointed with this book that hecried.Although the story offers an alternative to fighting, thealternative is only born out of the ineptitude of both the knight and the dragon. They try to fight, but fail. Only after failing do they become friends. What kind of motivation is that?In addition, the story did not offer any motivation for the knight to fight the dragon in the first place. There was really no conflict. Therefore, they did not overcome anything by working together in the end, except perhaps their own ignorance. Even at that, though, the knight and the dragon do not finally come to any deeper understanding about each other.If the author wanted to help children understand that we should work together, why not show the knight and dragon working together to solve a problem?If your child revels in the brave deeds of St. George and other knights, he or she may be sorely disappointed.This knight and dragon are wimpy!"
4,Great read.,"Its funny, but not hilarious. It has great illustrations, the looks on the dragons face are charming. Easy read for young kids, will hold my 4 year olds attention, but barely. Fun book."
5,Classic business partners,"I am so sick of this book! My twin boys have been fascinated with this story for two years now. We are swimming in books here at home, but month after month this one continues to find its way to the evening ""cuddle up with a book"" time. The lack of words has encouraged a lot of sound effects, and there is just enough animosity between the knight and dragon to make it a little bit scary. Despite the failure at destroying each other, the two ultimately become business partners. The example is sufficiently classic to fill a whole chapter of the well-known marketing book,How to Drive Your Competition Crazy. Make sure to look at some other DePaola titles, too -- my kids love them all."
4,Great Picture Book,We bought this book for our boys last Christmas and I love it. It has few words and this gives us the chance to discuss different themes depending on what they need to hear. I especially appreciate that it shows the characters practicing their skills - being bad at first and then doing well. My guys need that kind of message. I also like the ending theme that working together is better than fighting. It's not a book we read every night but it is one we re-visit periodically and get to enjoy new things with it. A great add to your library.
3,Didn't love,"This book reads more like a comic book, which is a little more confusing for my toddler. The information in it is good, and it uses good terminology."
3,Not a lot to read here,"I bought this book for my 7 year old son who is wanting a ""Knight Birthday Party"" next month. He loves playing the hero. I enjoy Tomie de Paola's books, and this looked cute. Flipping through it, I noticed that there are actually very few words to the story. So there's not a lot to ""read."" It's still a fun story, and has a cute twist at the end; I think my younger kids will actually enjoy this more as they tell themselves the story while looking at the pictures."
4,Great Dragon and Knight tale for young children - not violent!,"Every young boy (with European ancestors) should learn something about dragons and knights, but most of the old stories dealing with this subject matter are horribly violent and inconsistent with the pacifist values you may wish to impart to your child/ren. This charming book manages to overcome such concerns. The ending is slightly silly, but the illustrations are great. The story is quite good; the dragon and the knight have a strong presence and trade in the ""glory"" of battle for a a very pleasant bbq. Great for 2-6 year olds."
2,Did not love it,"With a 4 year old son who loves knights, I thought this would be a great book. There are lot of illustrations and I found it to be a but shy on text. If you are trying to promote young readers, I am not sure this is the book for you...."
2,Buyer Beware...,"Let me start by saying the the book is adorable, and a must have for any kid who wants to be a knight.This review is less about the book and more about Amazon's poor packaging.I ordered this item with a much larger item and this book (a fairly small paperback book that is not particularly sturdy) was just thrown into the box with the other item. When it arrived the back cover had a huge scratch in it, the edges were curled and the pages damaged from bouncing around in the box on a delivery truck for a few days.I have ordered from Amazon multiple times in the past and have never had this problem but the way this was packed was very disappointing, especially since it was ordered to be given as a birthday gift.So buyer beware, if you order this item from Amazon, be prepared for it to arrive damaged."
5,My little boy and I read this delightful book over and over without any diminishing joy,"When I think of the hundreds of times, my sweet little boy insisted on reading this book, I am transported back to the happy cuddly times when he would sit on my lap and he would pour over the pictures of the knight making all this weapons and the dragon getting in shape for the fight that everyone expected them to fight. The sweet pictures, the humor and wisdom of the end was always a happy and satisfying tale to be enjoyed. Do not miss the art, the story and the ""moral"" of this timeless of what happens when mortal enemies discover that they don't have to be mortal enemies and can become friends in the funniest way.Bravo Tomie dePaola! A masterpiece in children's literature."
2,I've seen much better,"The two skeins of yarn didn't match, and there were knots and unevenness such as loopsin the skein I used."
4,Caron Simply Soft Yarn,I have a problem sometimes getting enough yarn of the same color to complete an afghan and so I was very happy to find a supplier from which I could do so. Thank you for your help.
3,Use with caution,"Use with caution, March 19, 2008I bought several skeins of this yarn for a project just because I liked the colors, and I was tired of using Red Heart super saver. I used the Caron for my first knitted project; a scarf. The yarns are soft and there are some beautiful colors available, but, the plys of the strand split very easily. What I mean is when you are working, it is easy to put the needle right through the strand, and if you aren't paying close attention (i.e working while looking at tv), you could easily knit both halves of the same strand and add another stich on that row. The same is true for croheting. There seems to be ample yardage on the skeins; one is enough to do an adult sized scarf with a little left over."
3,Dye change from previous years,"It's been a while since I've bought the simply soft yarn, and while it's still nice and soft the dye intensity has changed. When compared with old work this black is a bit dull, more like charcoal. It's pricy, too. It wasn't *that* long ago I could get a skein for $3-4. I don't think I'll be buying again, but I was glad at least to get the yarn I did to finish a project."
5,Caron Simply Soft,I just made an ear warmer and am working on mittens to match. This yarn is so soft and has a luxurious feel and look to it. Love it!
4,"Good Yarn, Beware of smaller size","I love this yarn. I use it all the time. It's very soft and nice to work with. I received 5-ounce skeins, not 6-ounce. I'm sure it's just a cost saving action on the manufacturer's part. Amazon probably didn't know they changed from 6-ounces to 5-ounces. Still my favorite yarn though."
4,If Kevin Smith had made Talk Radio...,"This is one of my favorite types of movies...I love it when a filmmaker can take pretty much one location and a small group of people and turn it into something great. Oliver Stone did it in the 80's with Talk Radio and these guys did it again with White Out. The strong writing and great performances will make you want to watch it again and again.It's a fantastic film, go check it out."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"I apologize to the people who made this movie, but it is really the most moronic, crude, and vile piece of garbage I've ever had the misfortune of being dumb enough to watch. ""Galactic Gigolo"" cannot be enjoyed on any kind of ""camp value"" level. It is not ""so bad, it's good."" It is so bad, it's really, really, really bad, stupid, and repulsive. Somebody on the IMDb has the same opinion, and I just feel the need to back him up here because I hated this movie so much, and I don't understand how anybody could say they enjoyed it unless they have an I.Q. lower than a vegetable's or are pals with the director. I could lie, and tell you it was great, and to go see it right away, just because misery loves company, but I'm not that petty. If I could give it no stars, I would. By the way, I think there's maybe like three seconds of T&A, so don't bother if that's what you're after. This movie relies on its ""comedy"", which no amount of naked women could possibly redeem anyway."
2,Silly but Fun,"Director Bechard's GALACTIC GIGOLO suffers from some editing problems, but fans of his amazing debut feature PSYCHOS IN LOVE may get a kick out of the main star (Carmine Capobianco) in action again. A hilarious opening scene is worth the price!! For fans of cheezeball comedy only. RELEASE PSYCHOS IN LOVE AGAIN ALREADY!!!!"
1,Bad quality vide,This movie is either a satire of bad movies or one of the worst movies ever made.If the video quality was better it was be more watchable.It looks like it was copied of of a laser disk.If you enjoy over done satire you will enjoy this movie. It doesn't play well on large screens as the pixelation becomes very obvious
1,The film that wouldn't die!,"I actually worked on Galactic Gigalo and am in several scenes. We were a crazy bunch of kids making bad movies on the weekends. Don't miss my old girlfriend Yvonne as ""Vanna Greene"" or Carmine as the old lady with a beard in the studio audience. Yikes!"
3,I ask the question...........why?,"Why ask why you ask? Because this is one of the always short and lame ""Millennium"" collections, and they already have out an excellent 20 track best of entitled ""Stars: 1992-2002"". That collection, though also imperfect, includes every song here, and adds 9 more with better packaging. However, rating this just on the music I give it 4 stars. After all, these are very good songs, and roughly their best. Again though, for a few more dollars I'd get the ""Stars"" collection in a heartbeat, but I guess you're ""Free To Decide""."
1,not happy,i gave this one star because when i received this product i was sent a Emenim dvd inside of the Cranberries cd case. not a happy camper . i cant stand Emenim
4,Really good entry in an interesting series of books,"First of all, some color photos would have given it five stars. The black & white photos herein are still great, though. There is an informative introduction, and all the photos have interesting captions. There are also some photos of interiors, engines and ads, etc. Several fascinating photos of prototypes as well. Recommended to car enthusiasts who enjoy the independent makes."
3,Not the Skylark I was expecting,"I loved the Skylark album from the 70's with ""Wildflower"" and thought that they had regrouped for new albums. Upon my first listening, I quickly realized this is not the same band, so my first listening was somewhat skewed. This album is not terrible, but not anything that I would highly recommend either."
5,Excellent for new believers,Buy these and give them out to new Christians in your church. Very simple and easy to understand. No deep theology just facts.
3,Lifeless sound on Rhino LP,"My rating reflects the sound quality on the Rhino vinyl release. I expected a vinyl release would merit audiophile quality sound. Instead, the life has been sucked out of this otherwise joyful collection of songs, presumably due to an overly aggressive and misguided noise reduction processing of the original tapes. I cannot recommend this Rhino release."
4,This album gave Bruce the Juice.,"Listen to this album immediately followed by Springsteen's ""Wild Innocent"" and Van's influence on Bruce will be crystal clear. I'd like to see both Van and Bruce make this kind of music again."
4,One song makes the purchase more than worthwhile!,"I bought this CD for one song=-- ""I'll Be Your Lover Too"". I'd heard it at the end of a TV show or movie, and couldn't believe I'd never heard it before. I'd always liked Van Morrison, but was on the young side to be overly familiar with his songs unless they were played on the radio a lot.""I'll Be Your Lover Too"" blew me away, and it's worth the purchase price just for that song. Throw in several other great numbers on this CD and you've got every reason to buy it.The versatility of the selections on this CD is amazing.His unique style and fearless approach to being different is so refreshing."
3,Ugh,"Nora Robert's work is fairly enjoyable to read, but sometimes I'm just disgusted when she uses the same descriptive word over and over. I'm tired of reading about Ana's ""smoky eyes"" and ""hair like sunlight"" or ""gold"". How Boone is ""dangerous"" and ""attractive"". And how they can't control their wild, wild love. We got it the first time, Nora. Its okay, really; you can stop now. Fine, tell me again about Ana's legs. Thats what I'm here for! Ahem. But, it certainly gives you what you asked for. Romance. And its not a BAD book. Pick it up if you've got time to kill, but if you want something valuable that'll leave you fantasizing (or whatever one does after reading romance), you could find better."
4,Charmed AND Enchanted,"This was a reread for me and an enjoyable one.These are the final 2 stories in the Donovan Legacy. A family of witches, each with their own specialty.In Charmed we have Anastasia story. She is the cousin who is an Empath. She is also a healer because of her strong empathatic feelings. After be turned away by her first love when he found out what she was, Ana has stayed away from men to protect her heart. Then widow Boone Sawyer moves in next door with his young daughter. She fears telling him what she is, then fate steps in. This was my favorite out of all the Donovan stories. It is so good. Emotional and loving.In Enchanted we have the story of Liam Donovan a witch and a shape shifter. He goes to the woods to be alone to think about an important choice he is going to have to make. Rowan Murray goes to the woods to find herself. They find eachother and she discovers so much more about herself. This story had a lot more ""magic"" in it. It was fun and the characters wonderful."
5,Charmed,"I love Nora Roberts. She's an awesome romance novelist.This series is one of my all time favorites ! The romance,the wording, just grab your heart and makes you believein the power of love. The magic in theme is super also.Trust me, you will NOT be dissappointed in these books.I'm glad I read them !!!!! twice :)"
5,Donovan charm!,I was charmed from the first meeting of Anastasia and Jessie. The witch and the little girl become friends at once but the widowed father is a little more trouble. This is a fun and touching story. Don't miss the trip this family takes.
4,Totally Charmed,"I absolutely loved this story. I thought it would be cheesy mixing magic into romance, but I was SOOO wrong. This was a wonderful tale that I'll enjoy reading again and again. The Anastasia and Boone are great together, and Boone's daughter is priceless. To bad I can't say the same for the series. The idea of the Donovan legacy is genius, but all four books were not. Captivated was just moderately good, and Entranced was terrible. Please skip that one. But Charmed and Enchanted are totally enjoyable. Hey, 2 out of 4's not bad. Kudos Mrs Roberts."
2,Disappointing,"Although Ms. Roberts is a good storyteller, this book was a total disappointment. The storyline was weak, and the chapters were filled with redundancy."
2,Didn't make my 100 page rule,If a book doesn't grab me in the first 100 pages I move on. It's not worth my time. This is the first Willie Morris book that I have read. I can't imagine all of his books were like this. Hopefully Taps is the result of bad editing. The words and language he uses is so out of place for the story it's laughable. My husband was tired of hearing all of the bad passages each night. I guess if you like the author you will like the book but if you have never read him before try something else first!
4,Style Over Substance,"Willie Morris was a better writer than most others. His non-fiction works (North Towards Home and New York Days) make better use of his gifts. This book, on the other hand, is limited by his decision to spend most of the book in the head of his 15 (or 16) year old narrator."
3,Lacks a strong narrative drive,"Gifted, with a clear distinct voice, Willie Morris' TAPS while insightful to a time past, yet lacks a strong narrative drive. With all the well-drawn characters, Morris sets up the reader in a way that suggests something is going to happen. It doesn't. I would recommend the book, but don't expect to be riveted, rather rocked by the wonderful prose."
3,"""FLEETING CONSUMMATIONS""","Yet, one more study of intense loneliness captured by Vivien Leigh as the freshly widowed actress - alone, affluent, and so bored in the Eternal City,It's that vacuous 'la dolce vita' climate for her until a rather 'shady' madame [a scary Lotte Lenya] procures a companion - Warren Beatty, with obligatory accent, he defines ""boy- toy"" in this one!This premise is vaguely dated, and everyone seems to be having a real bad hair day [ugh! those ugly wigs!], and our Karen is suitably disillusioned as the evenings churn on and on ....Good moments from Corale Brown and Jill St. John in supporting roles BUT it's that wonderful free-spirited, is it[?] conclusion [similar to 'Summer and Smoke'] that stays! Another Great view from the Terrace! AND just what is it with these lone American ladies abroad??Good companion to Hepburn's ""Summertime"" - possibly ""Death In Venice"" [just a shade darker though.........]"
4,VIVIEN`S FOURTH AND LAST COLOR FILM,"They speak of Garbo, Davis and Hepburn. But no one could touch the great Vivien Leigh. Each role; another interpretation. She was a stunning actress with gorgeous looks. In THE ROMAN SPRING OF MRS STONE she is supported by newcomer Warren Beatty. Leigh dismissed Alain Delon as a choice for Paulo since she felt he was too beautiful..."
5,made me cry,"Vivian Leigh is an incredible actress. She has made me cry in Gone With the Wind, Waterloo Bridge, and Anna Karinina (sp?). In this film, she plays a middle aged woman who's husbnd dies on their way to Italy. She decides to stay in Italy and falls in love with a young Italian (Beatty with an accent). He is basically a gigalo and she knows it yet she loves him. The end is so powerful and there's great cinamatography (a dying art). I cried and cried and cannot wait to see it again. See this and Waterloo Bridge and be wowwed by Leigh!"
4,Vivien at her best,"The movie was entertaining, and shocking to see a young Warren Beatty. The ending is short, but if you paid attention to the film it fits perfectly"
3,Fine Tennessee Williams story.,"Recommend this seemy tale, one of Vivien Leigh's final films and one of Warren Beatty's first. She is haunting as an aging, widowed actress trying to regain a foothold on her life in Rome, and he is fine as a gigolo, with whom she becomes infatuated. It also includes a wonderful performance by Lotte Lenya as his pimp, a dissolute old Countess. This evocative story is not the most cheerful, but is certainly involving up to its somewhat mysterious ending. I would add that it is very erotic without once getting even slightly explicit. That says something."
3,Leigh saves the day!,"In this rather tepid film suave Warren Beatty attempts to seduce aging actress Vivien Leigh following the death of her husband. Based on a story by Tennessee Williams, this was one of Leigh's last, great showcases. Even towards the end of her life she still remained captivating (and a consumate actress). Her performance makes this slow, trying film worthwhile. Warren Beatty approaches camp with his greasy giggolo character, and the accent is just a touch shaky. At any rate, Lotte Lenya received a well-deserved Oscar nod for her perfomance as Beatty's ""arranger of romances."""
3,It`s Vivien`s film,"This is the only picture directed by the renowned stagedirector Jose Quintero. And the reason is obvious. It has striking moments, but fails as a whole. VIVIEN LEIGH in her next to last role, shines in her undrplaying and is strongly supported by Warren Beatty(called Warren Beauty by Arlene Dahl), Lotte Lenya, Jill St. John and Ernst Thesiger(who appeared with Vivien in CAEASAR AND CLEOPATRA).The film is routine, but the story and performances save the day."
4,Check out Warren Beatty long before he became a famous director and married Annette,"Vivian Leigh is a marvel in this film, one of the last she did before her death. And Warren Beatty will surprise you with his Italian accent and gigolo lover performance. Gives a nice back drop to all that was to come later for him, even including Splendor in the Grass. This is one of my favorites by Tennessee Williams; I think this earlier version is more compelling than the more recent one with Dame Helen MIrren."
3,"not bad, not great","I've had this book for a while now, I would guess it to be written at a teenage level. The photographs are interesting but usually well known, if you collect much British Royalty material you will already have most of them. I do like it better than the video Prince William: Behind the Headlines."
3,compassionate touch,"A terrifice, albiet dated,way to start learning compassionate touch. Book offers insight into both patient and caregiver's unique needs at the end of life. A must for any caregiver."
5,This is a great book,"As a person who has a relative dealing with Alzheimer's, Ithink this is a great book. The movie was great also.We all need our family and friends to help us during hardtimes but we need God the most."
5,Great review of sculpturing,"A very practical view of the processes involved in sculpture making.The book is filled with practical tips and technical references.The author shares, in a delightful manner, his passion and experience about sculptures.It is a great reference even if you are only interested in parts of the process (i.e. Mold making, Finishing, Clay processing)"
3,Gable's Got Vocals!,"Eric Gable's debut, Caught In The Act, generated a good buzz, but not enough for mainstream hits. This excellect vocalist (in the same league as Luther Vandross, Freddie Jackson, and James Ingram) got a little air play, as did some album cuts, but Gable just barely missed getting the smash hit he needed on his 89 debut."
4,good debut,"i use to Groove to this album back in the day. Eric Gable had a strong solid vocal range and he was a voice that I thought was gonna be bigger. when this album came out and the title track got played on radio, i tapped it off the radio. some very smooth grooves cuts here that still hold up real well. He was a very underrated artist."
4,Great old shows,I bought these mostly to bring back some childhood memories. Cisco and Pancho are still enjoyable after not having viewed them for 45 years. The video quality is acceptable.
2,Classic TV,"All episodes in color, but the quality is about a 7 on a scale of 10; the real problem is my equipment can not track/playback with out stops and starts. I have tried differnet disks and they all playback with jerks and moments of still picture and no sound. I am disappointed with this set. Other products from this distributor have not had this problem."
3,Dangerous,"I've had this blender for two days and unfortunately have to take it back. The buttons are hard to press, and when you need to press them the whole machine slides across the counter top. They need some suction on the base of the machine. It is extremely loud, most plastic machines are.Mine came with a food processor attachment. I used it to grate cheese and I thought the thing was going to go flying off the base of the machine, then the counter top. It lost power while grating. Instead of wearing full body armor while cooking I think it has to go back."
3,hmmm...,I bought Sluggo a few weeks ago b/c I had a slug and snail problem in my garden esp. on my Fuzzy Face sunflowers. After I put the bate out... it seemed to help. Then the next day something... looks like snail bites... attacked every single plant in my garden not just the ones with the slug/snail problem and ones that they never ate before. I don't know if they went crazy and ate everything or what but there are now tiny holes from these insects in every single plant in my garden. I don't know if I can blame this precisely on Sluggo but that is what happened. I got a Slug Saloon and I guess I'll see if that works.
4,Did the trick,Killed the slugs that were having a hay day in my high tunnel. I was thrilled to see the OMRI certification on the bottle.
5,Fantastic product,"This is a product that I can recommend with confidence. I had tried a variety of products and gadgets to solve my slug problem to no avail The beer pans was expensive, wasteful, messy and ineffective. Other snail killers were dangerous to use around my dog. I was so tired of the slugs destroying my daylilies and hostas, that I overcame my revulsion and would pick them off my hand at night. I quickly discovered that sleep would be a thing of the past if I expected to defeat the little blighters. But then I found Sluggo and my problem was solved. Apparently the slugs love this product, eat it, then can't eat anymore, and quickly die of starvation. Best of all, it's safe to use around pets and children. Now the blooms of my daylilies are bite free and the foliage of my hostas are beautiful. Thank you Sluggo!!"
3,Not so sure about it,"Frankly, I like the old Bug-Geta snail bait better. This is the first I have tried this organic Sluggo. Generally, I try to buy organic whenever possible. And since my neighbors all have small dogs, I was interested in a product that wouldnt harm them. So that I appreciate.But the product itself does weird things in the flower beds. At first I didnt know what it was, since when it melted it looked like white mold. The first batch I removed, then later figured out that was the melted Sluggo. It seems that I have to put it out more often, like it doesnt last as long as the bad kind of snail bait. And I am not so sure my plants like it. I have it in flower pots, and around a large potted lemon tree. One flower plant instantly croaked.So it costs more, doesnt last as long, looks ugly and weird, doesnt make my plants happy, but its organic and wont hurt pets... so its better, right?: /"
2,Sluggo is expensive mouse food,I put out two pounds of sluggo to discover that mice hoard the pellets. The pellets would dissapear overnight and I thought they disolved in the rain. One day I uncoverd a moiuse nest and found about a pound of sluggo pellets hoarded in the nest. Its a waste of money for those that live on the edge of a forest.
4,Great for organic gardening!,"I hate killing things, I won't even set a rat trap. But it makes me SO MAD to go into my garden and find all my veggies eaten up by snails!! This stuff is great, it's non-toxic and works quickly and effectively. Best of all, it's safe for my kids, animals, and veggies :)"
2,Not Effective Against Earwigs or Slugs & Snails!,"I have used regular sluggo for snails & slugs with great results for over 2 years now so when I heard about Sluggo Plus, I decided the high cost was worth it. I bought a 2.5 lb bottle for $30. There are a lot of earwigs and sowbugs in my garden and the earwigs especially seem to do a lot of damage to my ornamentals. I have been using Sluggo Plus for over 2 months and it seems very ineffective against snails & slugs so I still need to use plain sluggo. I also just found 3 earwigs inside the flowers on my Daturas that are still closed but ready to open any day. The earwigs are causing them to fall off before opening. I am very disappointed with the results of Sluggo Plus and will not purchase or recommend it ever again."
4,works as advertised,"product works as intended. slugs gone. However, I was also picking the slugs off in the evening. Costco, if you live close to one, has the bigger size bottle for $25."
5,Pet friendy...Slug deadly!,Best product available if you have pets. Get rid of the slugs without making your pets sick. My Hosta look great and my pets are happy.
4,1-2-3 Magic is working for our family,"We (my husband & I) have a 2-1/2 year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy. We started to notice some behavior that we felt should be corrected. Most noticably, fighting between the 2 of them, trouble getting them to bed at night, difficulty getting them to eat and constant whining. A co-worker of mine highly recommended the book 1-2-3 Magic. She has been using these methods for some time and swears by them. Additionally, we also enrolled in the 1-2-3 Magic course offered at the local Kaiser Permanente Medical Cntr. to further supplement our understanding of the techniques that Dr. Phelan discusses. I must say our home life has been smoother and more peaceful since we started using the methods."
3,"Condescending, mildly useful. Could have been a pamphlet.","The guts of this book could have been written in 5 pages, easily. I found reading it tedious and condescending. And we've found ""counting"" to be less than helpful. It may work well for some kids with easy temperaments (but then, why would you be buying a book, right?), but our daughter needs something else."
4,1-2-3- Magic,"I found this book to be a excellent resource for learning how to control ""stop"" behaviors. I am not as convinced on the start behavior tactics but we are going to give it a try."
1,Please send me the book,"I still have not received the book, nor have I gotten a response to my inquiry about why I haven't gotten it. HELP. I will be leaving the address I gave you on Dec 20th."
5,Very Positive Results!,"This book actually DID work! I couldn't believe that it worked with the methods being so simple, but it did. I'm not yelling anymore and my relationship with my 3 1/2 year old is so much better (no more talkiing back, being fresh, whining, or having tantrums). We've been using Dr. Phelan's methods for about 1 month now and the hardest part for me has been keeping consistent, but the results have been like magic like the title says. I love this book and the smart and effective and Loving methods that it teaches. I have given copies of it to my sister and my friends... I HIGHLY recommend it!"
3,Good points but not a fan,"I think I was expecting something a bit different...This is definitely a method that didn't work for us though a few of the techniques were helpful. We really disliked the time out ""alone"" idea and also the idea that you don't discuss the time out or reasons behind it. While it may change behavior it seems like a method that is nice for adults and not so beneficial for the children. I did like the the reminders about consistency and following through on consequences. I also like the idea of ranking your Childs behavior...talking back maybe a 2 but hitting is a 3....you'll get a warning for not listening, but an automatic consequence for hurting someone, etc. Overall, I wouldn't say it's a miracle but may be helpful to some."
1,Better books and methods out there,"I bought this book because so many people had told me it's the BEST parenting book out there. I have to disagree. It took me a long time to get through the book because it frankly was irritating. I feel that the author writes in an extremely arrogant tone and although the counting can have a place in every household with young children, i don't feel that a parent is listening to their children if this is the only method they use. I want more of a relationship and lines of communication with my 2 year old daughter than this book will ever give us. It will be up for sale at my next yard sale."
4,good guideline,it worked like magic the first day. the next day i think we may have relaxed a bit too much and now it sometimes works. maybe its just the terrible 2's that we have to overcome. i would recommend this book because it is easy to follow and makes sense.
2,"Basically good ideas, but rigid and punative","Some ideas are great -- no emotion in your voice when dealing with bad behavior; clear, predictable consequences.However the overall attitude and approach is too close to what I've used successfully with dogs, without addressing the grounding in love and humanity that we need with children.Often, the book refers to previous generations' reactions including whipping children with a strap. No question, the approach here is 100% better than beating your kids, but I'm shopping for an approach that is more nuanced, and gives a child a life-long understanding that people and authority are not just absolutes to be obeyed, and that their parents love them."
2,not entirely impressed,"I am a childrens therapist and I think that this method is certainly better than spanking or yelling, but I feel it is outdated and there are better ways of connecting with your child than counting at him. Saying 'that's one' to your child can become humiliating for the child and amounts to little more than threatenting."
1,It's not the way you discipline normal kids,"The entired book is summarized on the title itself. By counting 1 to 3 to make the kids stay disciplined is like training an animal.I don't believe it is the right way to discipline my 10 years old girl. I recommended the book titiled ""how to talk so kids will listen and listen so kids will talk"". That book is great and communication is the key."
5,Magic,This book is magic. It works. I bought 3 copies - one for each household our Grandson is in. He is a sweet little boy of 4 but will push buttons if needed so we all needed to be on the same page (sorry bad joke) and this method is usable by all 6 of us.
3,"Use it when necessary, don't abuse it.","I use a form of this on my 3 year old son when things are really falling apart in the listening department, and only when absolutely necessary. This system is used about once a week, if that. But there's nothing more annoying than being in a room with a parent that counts, ""1.2.."" every three seconds to their children. I don't think that's the point of this book. I hear parents abusing this system CONSTANTLY for EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING. ""Dylan, pick up your sippy cup. Okay, 1....2...... Dylan put on your jacket. 1.....2...... Dylan, sit down here. 1....2........ Dylan, let's go now. 1......2....... Dylan, put that down now. 1....2......."" and ON and ON and ON. Hey parents, if you wanted a robot, you should have purchased a robot."
1,Doesn't work if your child is stubborn and sensitive.,"First of all, this book is incredibly long-winded and repetitive. He could have explained the technique in a few pages, but rambles on and on. It reminds me of when I used to write papers in high school and used pointless examples just to try to fill the pages. The writing is also a little too condescending for my taste.It looks like this book changed many people's lives, but every time I tried the counting method with my son, he would scream ""No, don't count!!"" It didn't matter how I set the stage, or how much or how little I explained. The more we counted, the more bent out of shape he would get. And, pretty much, he would not stop the behavior until we got to ""three"" and then he would scream and throw a fit. Like any method, it works for some, but not for all."
4,1-2-3 Magic,"After reading this book I was anxious to havemy clients read it and ""try it"". It soundedeasy but I thought I better try it myself.I was taking care of my granddaughters (2 & 3 1/2).They have different parents and certainly differentpersonalities. 1-2-3 Magic works!The book is easy to read and understand which isimportant for my clients. I like this method betterthan ""Love & Logic"". By the way, I gave copies tomy granddaughters' parents."
4,well worth the purchase,"the book and the dvd were great! The man was a little boring at times, but the information it gave was worth a million dollars. The author was right...it worked right away with one son,a five year old, and the other son, age 3, took about a week to get adapt to the change."
5,Life changing,"This book has changed my life along with everyone in my house. The first 50 pages talked about scenes and examples of what was happening in my own home. This book offers a simple technique for parents to follow and for children also. It is just as much of a discipline for parents as it is for the children. So working together, you can create a peaceful household and enjoy your children. I would Highly recommend this book to every parent."
3,"I can see the appilcation LATER, but not for young children...","I have an 18 month old, so naturally, I am starting to need to find disciplinary measures that work for our family.I have read many books thus far, my favorites beingSupernanny: How to Get the Best From Your Childrenand more importantly,Love and Logic Magic for Early Childhood: Practical Parenting from Birth to Six Years. Oh and also this one:How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk... a VERY cool book that applies at many ages.My big issue with this system is that I don't want to give my child 3 chances. I really don't. I remember getting 3 chances as a kid and thinking, ""ok, 2 more chances to go before I get in trouble.""I suppose for some families this will work, and definitely for older children.... but not for us any time soon!"
5,Good Product--Size S/M is Actually a Medium,"I ordered two hats. Quality is good at a great price. The size S/M is a medium so if you have a small head like I do, it may be just a little big. Not a big deal, it serves the purpose of keeping the sun off my face, ears and neck. I would buy more."
5,Just what I wanted,"I wanted a hat for my husband to wear while running. He needs protection for his head and nose from the sun. This hat fills the bill, so to speak!"
3,Juan Gabriel - Para Ti,"I love Juan Gabriel, but the sound quality on this CD is terrible. You can't turn the sound up high enough to make up for the lack of depth in the recording. Too Bad."
4,Baby Loves this Toy,I bought this toy after my 7 month old daughter enjoyed a similar one at a friend's house. She really likes playing with it and has figured out the activities on each side. She does get tired of it and ignores it for a day or two but will come back to it time after time.
2,just so so,"I bought this for my 7 month old son because of all the glowing reviews, but he really isn't interested in it much at all. He'll occasionally flip and spin some of the parts, but he'd rather play with his other toys. Wouldn't buy this again."
4,Great Toy for Small Baby,"Our son received this toy as a gift when he was born. He was most interested in it when he was 5-9 months old. He liked to play with it while sitting in his high chair while we ate dinner. Each side of the triangle offers a different activity, so it held his attention for 10-15 minutes at a time."
1,Not Many Activities Here,"This is supposed to be an ""activity"" triangle, but it really only has one activity on it. That is spinning. You spin the mirror and some shapes. The only other thing you can do is rattle it, but it is too cumbersome for a baby to pick it up for that. I didn't like this toy at all and my child thought it was boring as well."
4,Best toy ever!,Get this! You will not be disappointed... This is the only toy that managed to grab my 6-month old baby girl's attention. I luv it!
5,5 Month Old LOVES this toy!!,"My 5 month old loses interest pretty quickly, but he absolutely loves this toy. It is by far his favorite. It keeps him entertained for a good long while!!"
4,This was a Christams gift so after opening it was put aside....,as the next gift was opened. When things calmed down he had his hands all over the toy. Nice compact on the go type of toy also.
1,RIGHT BOX CHEAPER PRODUCT INSIDE,"I ordered the toy that was $24.95,and was charged that amount. I received the triangle that is similar but is $15.11, it does not have the mirror but it was packaged in the box that the $24.95 one comes in. I was then told they did not have the $24.95 in stock so they would have to send a return label, which they did, and refund me, which they better. I read another review on here where they received the cheaper version but I do not think they realized they ordered the expensive one and received the cheaper one. So check your package contents and be sure you received what you paid for. I felt like it was bait and switch."
2,My 1-2 yr old NEVER played with it.,"It looks great and I thought it would be a big hit, but it really depends on the child. My one year old never showed any interest in this toy. Not with prodding or guidance or anything. I know some kids love it, but be aware that others won't. AT ALL. I say have them play with it in a store first and see if they're interested. It's kind of pricey to be given away unused."
5,Hours and hours of fun!,This product was bought for my 7 month old daughter. She will sit with this toy and play and play and play. There are lots of little places for her to grab. It has many activities and is easy for her to pick up and rotate around. I highly recommend this toy for any child who is able to sit up on their own or assisted. You will NOT be disappointed!
3,Hit or miss,"I bought this for my first child and this triangle has been passed on to two of his siblings. So far, I'm 0 for 3! I thought I couldn't go wrong with such good ratings but my kids never played with this. I have one more baby on the way so hopefully he/she will play make use of it.That said, I can see how this could be fun for young ones. To date, I've spent more time playing with this than all of my kids combined.My only safety concern with this toy is that it's relatively heavy. Be careful if handing to a baby who is laying on his back."
4,Pretty good,This is pretty good toy. A lot of activities for my son. It keeps him engaged for a while. I would have loved it more if it had letters / numbers also on one side. Then it would have been a good learning toy as well.
2,Really disappointed,"My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and pretty easily entertained. I read all the glowing reviews, and thought this would be a hit. So far, this hasn't been the case. The toy itself is bright, cheerful, and very very durable. I also like the fact that it doesn't need batteries. However, apart from a few things to spin, and a few shapes to fiddle with, there really isn't anything to sustain her interest. At first I was pleased to find a toy that wasn't at all noisy, but, given the lack of visual stimulation, I don't even think that that's a bonus. Also, the picture on Amazon of the toy shows a mirror at one end - the one I received had a boring spinner with a dog and a bone on one side, and a kind of ""cage"" design on the other. I think it's supposed to be an optical illusion when it's spun, but it doesn't work at all. Hopefully she'll find it more interesting as she gets older."
2,Disappointed for the First Time,"I have been working my way through Zola's twenty novels. For better or worse once I begin a book I must finish it, even if I feel punished by doing so. The book starts out promising enough. While not a believer I still enjoyed Zola's description of the mystery of the Catholic Mass. While I was brought up as a Catholic I really never believed in God and certainly never knew all the nuances of the Mass. It is certainly complicated. But the hundred pages or so he spends describing joyfull plants and flowers and trees left me irritated and quite annoyed. He did not need to spend a hundred pages describing the Garden of Eden and man's temptation. A few pages would have sufficed. You get the idea. I'm surprised Zola went so far off the mark here. Well, everybody makes mistakes."
2,Outdated,"Well written and interesting, but very outdated. You're better off with Keen's new _Medieval Warfare_ or Verbruggen or R.C. Smail (Crusading Warfare) or France's new book."
2,Too simplistic,Mr OMAN views are very seriously outdated. This book might serve as an introduction but lacks analysis and accuracy.
4,Easter story,This video was perfect for the use we intended it to be. It was used in our after-school program and few if any of the students are involved in any other kind of spiritual training
5,Informational and Collectible!,"This small book is loaded with information about all the famous sites and landmarks in Paris. A must read if you're planning a trip to Paris. Also filled with what looks like prints from watercolor and charcoal paintings. Pictures are beautiful (see cover), making the book a great collectible as well!"
4,The Ark is capable of doing what was expected of it.,"Critics have made all kinds of claims that Noah's Ark could not possibly have held all the animals required for the wide variety of animal life found on the earth today. John has addressed this and many other related issues. He provides many plausable answers based on common knowledge in the fields of animal husbandry. Numbers, sizes and volumns are shown to be more than adequate adequate to house all the animals needed.I gave it 4 stars because John tends to be confrontational and the book, though chock full of valuable and pertinant information, is not an easy read."
4,Best I have seen,"I have known the author for almost 20 years. His treatment of Noah's ark is the best I have seen. I was reading it this morning (3/2000) and was impressed,anew, by the detail and the references. I am a geologist and a science educator and I have found no errors in logic or fact in the book. My only concern is the lack of overviews (summarys for each chapter), but I hope to correct this in the next two years by writing my own 4 page summary of the book."
5,Answers every questions imaginable,"This book is amazing in it's depth and detail. Mr. Woodmorappe answers every question anyone could ever ask plus a few more! The bibliograpy section is larger than many books. He has obviously done his homework. If you ever wondered how some aspect of the ark could have worked, or if you've struggled to answer critics of the flood story, this book is a must read."
1,hard to argue with,"This Feasibility Study is so agenda driven that he limits the numbers of animals on-board to just a few thousand.We don't know how many species there are even today.The number of non-aquatic species is certainly beyond several hundred thousand.It's not just a question of genetic diversity within two of a species providing the diversity needed for successful repopulation of the earth.It is also including all the species because that is what God said to do.Mr. Woodmorappe also deals with ventilation in an inadequate manner.One window on the ark, in a world where it was 100% humidity outside for a long time, wasn't enough.He is a man with intelligence but driven by a religious agenda it is embarrassing that this attempt ever occurred."
5,The pacesetting book on Ark feasibility,"No matter which side of this Ark feasibility issue you are on, this is the book all others must deal with. This is a tenfold improvement over all others."
5,Science at its very best,"The nature of true science is observational, empirical. Woodmorappe's book is an excellent treatise on how to use true science to solve 'problems'. Many sceptics have cast doubt on the Biblical account of Noah. The author has thoroughly researched these claims and refutes them soundly in this excellent technical book. Makes a great reference for all those wishing to give defense for their faith."
4,"A wonderful, scholarly study.","John Woodmorappe has done what many have been waiting for, for many years. His recent publication provides the scholarly study that is so greatly needed. No doubt, some will deliver ranting against this fine work, but let them attempt to attack the science, and they will surely fall short of toppling Woodmorappe's well defined approach to the issue of Noah's Ark. Love him or hate him, but he can't be ignored.Amazon is to be commended for including this fine work in their expanding catalogue.Searchers of truth will find this book a wonderful addition to their collections."
4,Noah's Ark: a Feasibility Study,"This book is the most complete and accurate examination of the technical and historic feasibility of Noah's Ark that I have encountered. Anyone who has an interest in the biblical Deluge as history or myth needs to read this book. It is my understanding that a structural engineering analysis of such a large wooden vessel, which is the only element I could find that was not thoroughly presented in the book, is under preparation by the author. I eagerly await its release."
5,Extremely thorough. Top Notch Research!,"You could probably write a book about this book. The level of detail is impressive. I wish more authors could research their subjects at this level. I believe that anyone who feels they have legitimate concerns about the feasibility of Noah's ark must not have read this book. I have heard it said by a prominent evolutionist that ""even if you drag Noah's ark down main street, I will still not believe!"", which leads me to state that, except for those whose minds are unchangeably closed, this book would be of tremendous value to anyone even remotely interested in studying the flood and specifically, the details of Noah's ark.I would highly recommend this book (or any other by John Woodmorappe). I can't imagine how many hours he must have put into this resource (it contains about 76 pages of references alone!). It's the easiest thing in the world to be a critic, but it takes a lot of work and integrity produce first-class research such as this represents!"
5,"A Must for Skeptics, but God's Word is Sufficient","John Woodmorappe has done an excellent job answering the many critics and skeptics of the flood. And his writing and research (77 pages of references) show that as Christians we don't need to be ashamed to declare God's Word. The book also opens the reader's eye to what a year on the ark would involve. The reader definitely will come away with a great sense of the responsibilities of Noah and the other passengers and the Providence of God which directed all the events. Skeptics of the Old Testament and will find much to make them squirm. However, one must realize that evidence alone cannot change the hearts of men. If they will not believe the simple testimony of God's word than without the working of God even excellent books such as these will not change their hearts."
5,Best Overview of Noah's Ark,"Woodmorappe is an experienced researcher who brings his thorough scholarship to the key issues involving Noah's Ark. Whether one is a Bible-believer or not, this book is a must-read to understand the scientific arguments swirling about this controversial topic. Woodmorappe's points are fresh and insightful. His book flows smoothly and logically. It is a bit technical and might perhaps have been made a bit more accessible with further explanation. But it is worth taking the time to understand scientific ideas like ""log normal distribution"" and ""vermicomposting."" This is a wonderful addition to the growing modern scientific creationist library."
2,Falls Short,"Book has all the key words: But, as the previous reader pointed out, is very repetitive. Also most of the concepts are talked about very superfically. Its almost like browsing through a power point presentation, without the speakers additional remarks. Quite disappointing. I plan to return the book ( I got it from borders. Gasp!)"
2,Good overview of basic concepts; poorly organized.,"Although this book provides a good overview of basic data warehousing concepts, it is not well written or organized. The same concepts, in fact the same sentences, are duplicated throughout the chapters."
4,Very good advice for beginners,"The book contains tons of very good advice for novice editors. The tips on planning will save a lot of time when the real work begins. The suggestions on the practical and aesthetic (including sound) aspects of editing will speed up the process and improve the quality of the finished work, perhaps by the equivalent of at least a few month's apprenticeship. The chapters on dealing with stress and team members, clients and the business, give an idea of the work environment to be expected. After reading the whole book, chapter 13 summarizes the most important tips as ""cheat sheets"" - very useful.The only thing I didn't like was a number of typos, and what I thought was an occasional lapse in a couple of explanations."
2,Not a Good Movie,"Being a Brittany Murphy fan, I bought this movie because she was in it. I don't think they gave her a good role. They made her someone who sleeps around. It was a bit awkward for me to watch. Eminem was not that terrible, but I could not relate to his character. They also used a lot of sick-looking 'black' guys and one sick-looking 'white' guy. Mekhi Phifer's hairstyle was very bad. I couldn't stand looking at it. I wish I could exchange this DVD for something else, but it's too late because I waited too long (it's not a convenient store, and after 24 hours they don't do exchanges or refunds)."
3,"Sweet and scrumptious, but still full of air..","This book was entertaining, short and basically pretty addictive. Much like chocolate itself.However, Almond's work was perhaps a little too short and a little too nothing for my tastes. It really lacked coherent intent, apart from the overriding attempt to seek smaller chocolate manufacturers within America. But there was little actually concluded or discovered.I disagree with other reviewers, I actually quite enjoyed the semi-autobiographic self-indulgence of 'Candyfreak'. This is partly the basis for its appeal. I did tire of Almond's subtle commentary of the exploitative practices of the industry, but his continued support of such practices.Essentially, there is not much more to say about the work because there is not much more to it. While I would recommend it as the lightest of entertaining reading, it basically doesn't really have a great deal of filling."
1,"Has some shining candy moments but please, no politics","The parts about candy are fun but I can't believe the author became political and stupidly at that, while also condescending to candy eaters. A shame."
1,Worst book ever written,"Bad writing, boring stories, and not enough information on candy makes this book a poor choice for most people. As for the person who said reviewers should have read the book's jacket, it's kind of difficult to do that when you buy off Amazon.P.S. Here's a hot tip for the author: you can still eat lots of candy and not have bad teeth. There's some new technology on the scene that may help you in that respect, and it's called a ""toothbrush."" Look into it some time."
4,A great summer book that won't melt in your hands!!,This is a book that will bring back memories for some and have others wishing they got to taste some of the candies Mr. Almond talks about. It's a book that will take you through tours of small candy factories and meet people who keep them alive. I was craving some of the candies as he was describing them. It's 261 pages of fun and for the one star people who dismiss this book for political reasons need to get a life. If you add the political vs the factual you get maybe 4 pages worth of political stuff. Did he need to put it in the book? Who knows? Is this a free country?? The last time I checked it was?? Who says politics and candy don't mix?? Now there's a candy bar I'd like to try.
2,What is Almond's real Joy?,"If you read 98% of candy Freak, you would think that Steve Almond is a true candy lover. The remaining 2% of the book is revealing that Almond can't really focus on anything but his nuts. The book is an enoyable run through the back alleys of the candy business but if Steve had left out all the references to male genitalia, Candyfreak would be a much better book."
3,Made me hungry!,"While this book about the candy industry was written in a nice, easy to read style, I found myself getting a bit bored sometimes. I love candy as much as the next person, but I don't get the same sort of pleasure the author does about describing how a candy bar is made. In fact, I get sort of confused quite honestly. That said, I did love the author and he made me laugh several times with tales of his obsession."
4,Good and true,"Unlike the reader from Kansas, I enjoyed Steve Almond's writing, politics and all. It's the sort of humor that flys right over that flatter-than-a-pancake state to my West, and lands somewhere in Colorado. Why, I can almost hear the laughter echoing off the Rockie's."
4,A scrumpious book,"What do you picture as a candy freak? In the biography ""Candy Freak"" by Steve Almond, Steve Almond is a candy freak. Steve Almond has eaten at least one piece of candy every day of his life. He visits many different candy factories over the course of the book. Steve Almond is the main character. I dont really think that he likes sour candy as much as chocholate because in the text, he does not go to a candy factory that manufactures sour candy. I think this book is best suited for late middle school to early high school students.Now ask yourself, who do you think is the candy freak?"
4,sweet sadness,"Almond writes with pulsing personality and sensual joie de vivre.This book is a unique mix of journalism, obsession, and personal revelations.The weakness... visits to the candy companies become repetitous.The strength... scenes of the author's childhood, his frailties, his stabs at adult love, and his disquiet about America.Almond's most poignant writing involves his sadness and doubt. Read this for his courage and candor, his observations on our individual quests and our strange society."
2,awfully amateur writing,"it's pretty amateur writing-- a better edit would have helped a lot, and some stronger direction for the author. (in the list of links in the back of the book, the description for one is ""This person rocks my world."" --um, you couldn't give us anything more than that? like, why?) the stuff about the author's childhood is mildly intersting; it's a lot better when he finally visits the chocolate factories. the descriptions of the owners of the factories is great and the interviews are fun too... that's where the book really picks up."
2,the book version of a twizzler.,"I really wanted to like this book. And, in fact, I did like parts of it -- the parts where the author was doing straight reportage. It was fascinating to learn about the different types of candy and how they are made (I love candy too). However, I didn't like the overall tone. It's high irony. The author undercuts himself, and also undercuts everyone he talks about, so every single person looks slightly pathetic. That's okay when it comes to the author -- he can choose how he's perceived -- but it's vastly unfair to the other people in the book. I don't think I ever want to meet this guy."
2,a huge disappointment,"I chose to read Candy Freak because I thought it would be a humorous diversion for a few hours. While Almond's book shines as he gleefully discusses his love affair with the cocoa bean, he left me bitter when he discusses world affairs. I literally threw the book across the room (where it still sits at this moment) after his progressive tantrum on page 204, about 4/5ths of the way through the book. The majority of people reading this book I would imagine do not care about Mr. Almond's politics. Why he would choose to interject them in a book about his love of candy bars is beyond me. There are a few belly laughs and tons of chuckles in this book, and I would imagine if you are of the same political persuasion as Mr. Almond the political diatribes won't bother you too much. But since I specifically picked up this book as escapism I cannot recommend it to those who are trying do the same."
1,Not at all what I expected,"I thought this would be a lighthearted look at the candy industry and to some extent that's what I got. There are some interesting tidbits about the candy industry and the people associated with it, but the overall tone of of the book is kind of dark and mean-spirited. Then as others have observed there are the countless references to the author's personal likes and dislikes. Yes, it is indeed a semi-autobiographical book for adults with four-letter words and drug use which is fine if that's what you're interested in. That's just not what I expected when I bought it. If you can relate to Almond's negative worldview and his extreme left politics then you might enjoy this book, but otherwise you'd be well advised to avoid it."
1,Sweet but no meat,"This book came to me highly recommended for it's humorous treatment of a fun subject. Well, I didn't find the writing interesting at all. In fact, it's pretty shallow and predictable writing---If Dave Barry type stuff just knocks your socks off you'll probably like this book. I found myself jumping ahead trying to find something interesting---gave up after 150 pages. Who cares what happened to the Clark Bar??? NoT I!"
1,Bitter aftertaste,"Like overly bitter chocolate, this book tempts you with a delicious idea but leaves you ultimately unsatisfied. It's really more of a journey through the underbelly of Steve Almond, a place I never intended or wanted to go. For example, what does the fact that he once used (or may still use -- it's left unclear) marijuana have to do with the candy industry? Not a thing, but we're ""treated"" to lots of tidbits like that throughout the book, which in my opinion reveals more about the author's vanity than it does the candy industry."
1,too many cavities,"ho hum. there are some wonderfully funny moments here, but mostly you end up feeling sorry for this guy, for his endless search to find, really--love!--in the form of something wrapped and packaged and sold for change. the endless diatribes don't quite jell. all in all left too many cavities in my mouth."
4,Steve Almond is great!,I loved this history/personal essay style romp through American regional candy-land! Almond has a terrific sense of humor and isn't afraid to use it. I could not put the book down and was moved to give a copy of this book to family who I know will enjoy it as much as I did.
4,WARNING: Reading this book may be hazardous to your diet!,"Boy, do I have a servious craving for chocolate after reading this book! *lol* It was quite fun, although by the final chapters of the book, I felt like he was merely repeating himself, as he kept visiting more and more candy factories.I definately want to see if some of the bars he mentioned are available locally; who knows - maybe I'll find something obscure that wasn't even mentioned in the book!"
3,readable but superficial,"Today, New Year's Day 1999, I spent reading the first 170 pages or so of Cantor's book. Pages fly by; it is readable. But it is also superficial, sometimes factually wrong. At one point, the periodic table of elements is presented as an anachronism leftover from the Victorian age. Chemists today, he claims, would not recognize it. ""... most chemists today would not even know the periodic table, nor would they have a use for it."" (p. 19, paperback edition). That's sheer idiocy, as any practicing chemist would tell you. Inorganic chemistry is essentially the further development of the great periodic table.My time today was not wasted - but beware."
3,brilliant but disappointing book,"in his attempt to be comprehensive,norman cantor's survey of twentieth century thought is often superficial. his history of the jews, ""the sacred chain"", was deeper, more intellectually stimulating and infuriating."
2,Indigestible,"The subject and scope is enticing, but this book demonstrates why the book industry must resuscitate editors. The authors' writing is wooden, repetitive and, finally, irritating. After 50 pages, it drove me to the comparative pleasures of a text on economics."
3,nothing special,"I wasn't really impressed by the flavor or the quality of the product. Seems like it's just dried and compressed some fruits, berries into a bar and packaged it. I still like my clif bars and protein bars."
3,I dunno...,"I'm thinking these need to be soaked in a little organic rum for awhile. While edible, I find the texture heavy and filling (a good thing), and the taste somewhere between dry fruitcake and silage."
3,Not as popular as the coconut ones in our family...,We got these and the coconut ones when we ordered. The coconut ones are long gone and these are still hanging on. Just a matter of personal taste really. i liked them fine but we definitely liked the others better. Definitely a quality item though. Great ingredients and gluten free too.
1,Buyer Beware!,This item has been mass produced and is made in China. Chances of you getting a defective product are high. I can't even find the name dekcell on the product.
4,Most Powerful Man,"This video truly depicts how for about half a century, the most powerful man in the world was not the President, but Hoover himself."
5,OUTSTANDING,"Wow!!! A wonderful novel with an intriguing story line, that grabs and keeps your attention thru the final pages. Through Ms. Brown's skillful interweaving of the characters lives, she has taken sensitive real life topics, transgender, heterosexual, same gender loving individuals and presented a human side, showing the perils as well as rewards life situations can bring. Her vivid descriptions place you in the middle of the lives of the characters, living with them their success as well as their failures. For anyone that has been in love or is now in a current relationship, this is a love story worth reading!The cover photo is a *great* added touch to this novel. Looking forward to reading other writings from Ms. Brown."
4,Please Clarify...,"it said that this box is an ""amazon exclusive"". well i have seen this box (and purchased it) with everything that it has in it at stores that sell it for $50. so i dont see whats so great about this supposed amazon exclusive. the set is fun to have, nothing special, but something that a Kurosawa fan would enjoy. and for those looking for Ran on its lonesome, there was a Ran masterworks edition put out in 2003 by Wellspring. Its easily found for $25 and it is a very good transfer."
3,[Bad] packagine,"Great transfer on Ran. Great features and extras all around. Sadly, very little thought went into actually packaging it so that the discs would not move freely in the large case. I've seen five boxes opened. Four had discs damaged beyond use. Sad. The fifth was undamaged though the discs were not in their holders upon arrival."
3,I wanted this set - but not if the DVDs are floating around,"What a shame that like the recent E.T. debacle, bad packaging is ruining customer enjoyment of what should have been a great title. Many of us would not have minded paying the extra to get an early copy of the new remastering of ""Ran."" (That disc is set to be released on its own next year). But hearing the sad stories of how discs were broken out of their spindles and damaged in shipping from so many folks, changed my mind. It is the same problem I've seen on many CD's, DVDs and DVD Audio discs."
4,"A Good Set, yet disappointing.","I just got this set in the mail and am pleasantly surprised. Sure the fluff is nice but uneccesary. And the addition of Kurosawa is nice. But for eighty-four dollars couldn't more have been done with Madadayo, not just re-hash the old DVD for a collectors set. Better yet release a film that hasn't found its way to DVD yet, Perhaps Dreams, or Rhapsody in August. An even greater idea would have been to release this with Kagemusha a film I still await on DVD. But I must admit again that the fluff is nice, and the documentary is amazing. For an added bonus the documentary disc has commercials Kurosawa directed for Suntory whiskey hidden throughout the disc. I just wish something new had been added to this set."
4,"Satistied with ""Ran""","I found the Fox-Lorber version of ""Ran"" deeply disappointing, but this newly restored version is really satisfactory. Visually stunning and sounds very clear.I am also happy that what I got with the disks isn't actually a ""shoji,"" which is made of wood and white paper, but a ""byobu,"" an ornamental partition, with images from ""Ran."" This can stay in my living room."
1,Why not sell shoddy material?,How many scratches can you fit on one DVD? This seller seems to know. What a big waste of money this was.
2,PT Barnum Set,"Looks like a sucker is born every minute. Not Throne of Blood, Kegamusha, Sanjuro, not even Kurosawa's first film Sanjuro Sugata. You only get 2 films, one is great (Ran) and the other is Kurosawa's last film...Nothing from the master's long list of exceptional movies..."
3,it's ok..,I guess it depends on what type of pit you have.. if you get it at a good deal it's most def. worth it.. wouldn't pay more then ten or fifteen dollars for it..
1,Bad packaging ruins the deal,"This product was mispackaged. It arrived with multiple broken parts--all four of the large granite pieces and the fire grate to be exact. My wife claims the package wasn't handled well by the deliverer, but faulty packaging didn't help.I'm extremely displeased with the trouble I've had in getting a refund or having a replacement sent. With a large, heavy item re-packaging is usually not an option if you've unpacked a good portion of the product before finding problems. The Amazon website was less than helpful. The representatives on the phone were less than helpful.If the product is sold by Target, I should be able to take it to any Target store and work out a return there. Was that an option? No!Based on my experience, I will only buy books from Amazon.com in the future. You've lost my business on any other kinds of items."
2,Not meant for out doors,Its an nice enough cover. Has soft underside. Cover doesn't keep water out! That's why I bought it. Now the inside of my fir pit is rusting. If you want something to look good and doesn't keep water out buy this cover.
2,Not worth the money,"The cover fits extremely tight, even though my square firepit is within the dimensions it's designed for. My square table has a square pit. This is designed for a round pit with a very tall screen. First time I used it the pit filled with rain that leaked through the seams. After that I put a kids patio chair in the pit so the rain would run off away from the seams. That helps sometimes, but not always depending on the rain and wind force. I wish I'd tried making my own out of a table cover or oilcloth. At least it wouldn't leak like a sieve."
4,No issues...,"So far, we love this cover. It doesn't fit our firepit exactly perfect but we're very happy with it. It has stood up to the heat and rain and kept our firepit out of the elements. No complaints yet!"
2,Hard To Believe,"Hard to believe that the same author that produced the very fine FLY-FISHING BETTER also penned this waste of time! How many different ways do we need to read that fly fishers are mostly snobs and that throwing popers to bass is the only way to salvation?!But don't give up on Mr. Scheck, just make sure you have a copy of FLY-FISHING BETTER, the best how-to book in my fishing libary. And read all of John Gierach way before squandering money and time on A FISHING LIFE..."
2,Not great,"First, this company send me the incorrect charger. Upon asking for a correct model, they did promptly ship me the right one, but then asked me to put the wrong one in the package, seal it up, and write ""refused"" on it. This was to avoid them having to pay shipping to come back to them. This is illegal and stealing from the post office. I will not purchase from them again."
4,It does the job,"Very sticky, but quite effective. Never use without the special powder that you apply under wax. It is sold separately, but a must for this product. Also, I advise that you get the wax remover cream, also sold separately. If this wax accidently gets on your hands, you will need the cream to remove it."
3,Value for money!,I bought this product after reading the reviews. Its definitely value for money. But the only issue is that the wax takes too long to heat up and the wooden spatula is too thin to apply on hands and legs. Other than that no issue with quality of the product and the cotton wax strips. They are quite handy!
5,WAXING at HOme is so much more efficient,"I spent $44 dollars or so on this and it was worth every penny.I actually got if for waxing my fiance's eyebrows. I was spending a lot of time plucking every few weeks and so we decided to invest in this instead.We just get it out every two weeks or so and about 5 minutes later he has perfect eyebrows.If you turn the temp to High, the wax gets too hot and will not come off of the face like it should. It is best to turn the temp to Med-High and let it sit for about 20 minutes before using."
3,Instructions in English please!?,"This product is ok, for the money. The warmer is great, didn't take much time at all to warm the wax, and it seems to be well made. The application sticks are cheesy, as other reviews have stated.My biggest complaint is there are two pamphlets of detailed instructions..and neither are in ENGLISH! If you're going to sell a product here, make sure your customers don't have to be bilingual!Part of the instruction, in the small booklet are in English..so..???"
3,Does heat up very well,This is OK. It doesn't heat the wax very well. The strips look a lot smaller than they actually are.
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"ONCE AGAIN, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AS WELL AS THE SPEEDINESS OF SHIPPING OF PRODUCT. THANKS!"
4,Cheaper on amazon,"I bought this from Amazon for my girlfriend and she said this is way cheaper on amazon then going to the stores, she loves this brand of wax warmers."
2,Good movie- awful dvd,"I always thought this one of the better Emmanuelle films and it still is but this has got to be the worst DVD's ever. It's not so much DVD artefacts that the actual master seems to be from a home video recording with the bleeding colours and tape dropouts a dead giveaway. There is no reason to get this on DVD unless that's the only way you have to see this. Film gets three and a half stars, DVD only one star. A pity"
1,Don't touch it,"While Emmanuelle 4 is in my opinion the best movie out of the whole series, this DVD is crap! The Audio is catastrophic, the Picture quality is worse then on a VHS tape and the worst: it is cut so badly, that, well, all the reasons you buy an Emmanuelle movie for, are gone...Get the uncut version somewhere else, but save your money on this movie."
2,Edited and flat version of 3-D movie,"EMMANUELLE IV was shot entirely in stereoscopic 3-D and widescreen; however the DVD version is cropped and only 2-D. The old MGM video looked better, but that was also cropped and flat. A widescreen 3-D version was released on disc on Japan; it requires field sequential glasses such as those used with the IMAX 3-D sets, but this version was also edited."
4,A classic on biological invasions,"This is a classic work (originally published in 1958) by the British scientist, Charles Elton. It is a must read for those who are interested in the field of bioinvasions, even if modern researchers do not agree with every point Elton made.Elton gives examples of species that have been transported from one part of the world to another, sometimes becoming established pests. He shows how biogeographic areas may start to blend in, if not be lost, if biological invasions occur continuously.Another issue Elton looks at is the use of pesticides and the resulting resistant strains of the pests the chemicals were meant to eliminate or control.In the end, Elton calls for conservation - a co-existance between humankind and nature, and ecological variety."
2,A Bit Outdated But Still Useful,"This book was published in 1998, much in pitching has changed since. Even Dick Mills has changed his views on ""icing"" and ""long toss"" since the publication of this book. The book still has a lot to offer in terms of conditioning, but with the field of sports science changing so quickly, as well as what we know about pitching, I suggest you seek something more up-to-date. Dick Mills himself has published a more advance and thorough book since, but with a $100.00 price tag.However, you can still benefit from this book. I still use my copy as a reference for some of the exercises it describes, especially those for the rotator cuff. Although you can get these for ""free"" online. The book is not on pitching mechanics, as such it still has a lot to offer in terms of conditioning. I would still recommend it, even though I would not consider it any longer the ""Ultimate"" or ""Survival Guide"" in conditioning...more like ""Just a Guide"" to conditioning."
4,Calming PassionFlower Extract,This herbal extract has a calming effect on the body. Just a few drops a day in water helped me when I needed it.
5,Rebeca Is A Rebel,"Most artists change their sound when they make a new album, which leads to critisism. Rebeca not only changed her style to sound a little more rock, but kept her old sounding dance style at the same time. The result is Rebelde, a great album."
1,Uniform Drawing Format Manual: New Cadd and Drafting Standar,"Although the idea is good, the execution of this national standards review misses the mark. Mr. Stitt was unfortunate to have based his overview on an outdated model. All of the information I reviewed fails to reflect the current AIA and CSI documents, despite a copyright date later than the current national standards. The level of detail is inadequate for providing standard guidelines suitable to assure compliance."
1,Very Poorly Edited Book!,"I have read several books authored by Mr. Stitt - however, this particular book was especially poorly edited. The content of the book itself was fine and useful.I found it ironic that a book dedicated to elevating the precision and accuracy of architectural construction documents would be burdened with so many spelling errors, repeat sentences, slang comments (I guess to give some personality to the author) and out of context information. The book was difficult to read because the errors were so distracting.I can only speculate that either the book was published in haste and not edited at all prior to printing; to save money, 3rd graders were hired to edit the book (paid with candy and lunch money); or, Mr. Stitt has become very sloppy with age.All said, the previous books I have read by Mr. Stitt have been masterful in presentation and content. This book is a huge disappointment!"
5,Great,I like Andy Garcia. He is a great actor. The movie is based on true events showing Russian soldiers as idiots
1,What a LIE!,"The movie is nothing but LIE and FILTHY PROPAGANDA!It was EXACTLY in REVERSE!The Georgians started that WAR and killed thousands of innocent peoples.DO not learn history by watching this propaganda.Have a look at the facts!UN in the final word after all this ""investigations"" took place called GEORGIANS the AGGRESSORS!This is a well known Fact!"
4,Good movie based on real events,"It's unfortunate that this movie was not released to wider audience, as it is pretty entertaining. The movie has a couple of slow spots, but if you hang in there, you will be glad you did. Be warned that there is some war-related gore involved, but it's a WAR movie. Noteworthy performances from Andy Garcia as the President of Georgia, Johnathon Schaech as a Georgian soldier and, finally, the actor who played the role of the young Russian(?) mercenary.As you watch the movie, try to remember that it is NOT A DOCUMENTARY. If you sit and overanalyze the events portrayed in the film, you'll spoil the movie for yourself and anyone in your company. Add this to your next movie night!"
5,Great Item,This bag was the best Quality for the best price out there. Its perfect for trips to the grocery store and folds up flat under the car seat for storage. You never know when you may need a cooler to put some frosty beverages in.Handy Item.
1,bad bag,"This bag you are selling is not working in a hot weather at all, I purchased a deferent bag at Trader Joe`s for only $2.99 that works in Las Vegas heat it has real insulation and very strong , my family ask me to send them bags to Texas because this bag is not available there.You can make it available for all the country.ThanksIrina"
4,Fun little guy.,"Bought the Pocket POD a few weeks ago because I am living in an apartment. I use it for practice and also plug it directly into my computer to record.It doesn't sound nearly as fat and rich as a good amp, sure. But it's also pretty cheap to buy. Playing with the knobs on the device will only get you so far. I didn't think that the manual was so bad. I understood all the little pictures. But then I plugged it into my computer and loaded up the Vyzex software. There is quite a bit more to this thing than the manual lets on. I'm not sure you can tweak all of the settings without a computer.With a computer, I've played around with all the settings and created a few tones that I'm happy enough to record with."
1,Absolute garbage - Do Not Buy!!!,"Right after the warranty ran out, the only effect it would create was heavy distortion with flange. No matter what setting I switched to, it only produced one effect. The volume was low and refused to respond, too. Once I managed to get it to respond to the controls by powering it down and back up, but that lasted about ten minutes.When it worked, the tones were thin and artificial sounding. This thing does not deserve the Line 6 label, and they should have the self-respect to NOT ever sell it again. Utter crap. Don't bother."
1,$120 down the toilet,"This is very poorly made and Line 6 customer service is a joke. The DC jack is loose after 2 months of use and cuts in and out. Took it to a repair center as it is still under warranty. Evidently this unit is a replace not repair and they are refusing to replace it because the sticker with the serial number has fallen off. Seriously?! Why the f#*! is the serial number not imprinted on the actual unit if it is that important? I have a receipt. Why is that not enough? Add this company to the ""I will never buy from again"" list."
2,"breaks easily, fussy","I like what the pocket pod does, though don't think it sounds too awesome, and its really fussy about the power connection. And mine no longer works on batteries. I'd rather have something well made than something that has this much functionality."
2,Ok for practice.,"The Good:This is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.The Bad:The tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination, unless you like hyper-distorted noise. The cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied. The effects are hit and miss as well. Plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive.Throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones."
3,Not your typical line 6 product,"I have to say I am a bit disapointed in line 6's approach to this otherwise nice little device. Unlike the nice solid metal cased POD's, this is a cheap plastic device that feels like it will break at the first turn of a knob. Line 6 has always made great products. What were they thinking? Save costs? I would have glady paid an extra $20 for metal case and knobs."
2,"Interesting, but hardly ""history""","An amusing bit of fluff for those unfamiliar with silent stars but I was stunned by the number of factual errors (dates, film titles, names)--especially for someone with so many decades writing about the subject! Did Mr. Slide have no editor on this project, or is he, ummm, ""slipping?"""
5,Can be installed either direction,"This toilet paper holder is a lovely polished brass, which is nearly impossible to find in stores these days. We have all brass fixtures in a Victorian style bathroom, and this holder matches perfectly. You actually can install it facing either direction without the set screw appearing on top of the holder. In order to flip the holder the other direction, use a 3/32"" allen wrench to loosen the set screw on the ball part of the holder (as opposed to the mounting set screw that uses a flat screwdriver in the base). Once it's quite loose, you can pull the holder bar from the base, flip it around, and reinsert it. Tighten the set screw back down to where it swings as you'd prefer, and you're in business! It's probably easiest to do this before you install it because you can turn the holder over, but it's not impossible to do it while it's in place."
3,Great look for cramped space.,"Great look for cramped space. As other reviewers mentioned, the roll easily slips off this holder. I found that if I wrapped a rubber band around the arm, it prevents the toilet paper roll from falling off."
1,Cannibal Sideburns-!,"Folks, the ""cannibals"" in this unintentional comedy appear to have been recruited from a local pool hall: they all have different haircuts, none of which are even remotely convincing - and at least one ""cannibal"" has sideburns! They jump around with sticks, hooting and chanting like it's a pledge initiation. It does have a few decent gore scenes, but it's hard to keep from laughing. Fortunately I love really bad films, and I'll buy this new version. I just wish I could share it with Mike and the 'bots."
4,"Good, diverse mix","I love Lisa's primarily dark and dirty undertones when it comes to her sets. I also like the diversity in this mix. The first two tracks on disk 1 set an amazing mood for what these mixes become. Definetely a fan of Lisa Lashes, and she is quite the looker. Some tracks could have been longer though......."
2,Lots of problems with this game!,"first of all there are so many bug and glitches on this game youll blow up for instase sometimes you walk backwards and when you win a showdown sometimes if you pick another players shen-gong-wu it chooses a different 1the last thing is the enviorments are little,easy to eat bosses,YOU CANT DIE!! just to make it to easy and there are few levels i even if you like the show i advise you DONT BUY THIS GAME!!"
1,There are better GSM books available in the market.,"This book is a kind of collection of related papers on GSM andvarious related subjects each written by different author. Thereare much better GSM books available in the market (like G Heineor S. Redl or M. Mouly or J. Eberspaecher or J. Tisal,etc.)Furthermore some wireless network architecture books (likeYi-Bing Lin) cover GSM and all GSM related subjects well enough.In stead of buying this book, one can collect similar papersjust by surfing in internet. I would spend the same amount ofmoney for buying other GSM books in stead of this one."
2,DONNA SUMMER XMAS,"DONNA SUMMER HAS SUCH A GOOD VOICE, WHY WOULD SHE MAKE SUCH A MESS OF THE BEAUTIFUL O HOLY NIGHT,IT WAS TERRIBLE,"
3,Only time will show ...,"I think that people would have to wait a lot longer to read a more balanced and maybe objective vision of what had happened in Chile. We must not let us drive to believe that was USA who caused the fall of Allende. The majority of the Chileans wanted him out. Nevertheless, no matter what the reason could have been, any crime committed under his government is certainly his responsibility -at least politically speaking. In economy, however, the Pinochet legacy can not be denied nor overlooked as minor achivement."
5,quick service,I ordered this book from GreatBookDeals and was very pleased with their speed in delivering. It was very well packed and received no damage in transit.
5,christmas,i recieved this book for christmas last year i read it in 2 days and passed it on to my mother we both enjoyed it very much
5,Great Overall Health Product,"I was happy to get this ""Bio"" CQ10 product because this form of Co Q-10 was recommended by a Health Newsletter that I receive. I couldn't find it at my health-food store. Co Q-10 enhances good health in so many ways. It's a powerful anti-oxidant and very helpful in cardiovascular illnesses; among many other things. I feel more energized since taking it a month ago."
3,HO HO HUM!,"SciFy does it again---another disaster movie! It has all the elements of other ""classic"" films like MEGAFAULT, POLAR STORM, ICE TWISTERS, etc.This one is set on Christmas Eve in a small Alaskan village where a young geologist and his family go looking for a Christmas tree and find themselves confronting an ice quake that also spouts ice geysers!The science is preposterous; the effects aren't very special; and nothing of major importance happens. The quakes are caused by massive amounts of methane gas (?) and our hero finds a way to channel the gas to an oil refinery...you can guess how a happy ending is inevitable.Brendan Fehr (CSI, BONES) and Victor Garber (ALIAS, ELI STONE) try gamely but don't have much to work with.ICE QUAKE is passably entertaining for folk who are obsessed with cheesy disaster flicks--just don't expect too much!"
1,Gigantic Glacial Fart Kills Dinosaurs,"And apparently producing a lousy flick as well.Prototypical fare destined for SciFi's Weekend rotation. Cheesy digital effects, worthless acting, crummy cinematography, and complete rubbish passing for a screenplay.What little fun was watching veteran character actor, Victor Garber, do a ""Mr. Coffee"". Classic example of prop overuse and lack of directional oversight.The only good thing in the entire flick was Yeti, played admirably by Cody The Dog. Arguably the best actor on the set. Cutest too.Like all good low-budget films - if properly handled and some attention to detail put in place, you can score a nice little hit. But this is the kind of B-Movie that the other B-Movies laugh at."
5,My daughters favorite!,"It's a Christmas disaster movie she all ready made me watch it fifty times. Not every one will love it as much as she does, but it is worth checking out if you like disaster movies, makes a great Christmas gift for a syfi fan"
4,Textbook,Is fulfills the requirement needed to complete the class - suffient for class requirements. Six more words required to submit.
2,Not good for the beginner,I agree with the other reviewer about all of the photos being in black and white makes it very hard to tell the difference between the before and after photos. The book seems to go over many ways in which you can use photoshop which might be of interest to someone who has some experience with the program. However it doesn't seem to be good for a beginner. I tried using it and became frustrated soon after that.
1,There has to be an easier way for newbies to learn,"I am sorry to respond with 1 star but the biggest failure of this book is that all pictures are in black and white!!! I can't even tell between the ""before"" and ""after"" pictures.Also, either I am not used to the tutorial style of this book or it was put together with not much thought on the purpose of the layout.I hope that there are other books out there that the titles don't decieve the consumer. Sorry Lisa."
2,Not as good as I thought,"This book is very fundamental. This is for beginning nursing students. As you progress through the program, you are expected to be more scientific with your rationales. This book do not have scientific rationales. I would not consider this to be a good source."
3,What a great/sucky game.,"Buy this game only, and I mean ONLY, if you need more aggrevation in your life.On the plus side, the graphics are stunning. Game has great features. Gameplay is also good.On the minus side, this game cheats like nothing I have seen before. I realized a long time ago that certain video games, especially sports games, tend to cheat, and I've accepted this.If you enjoy hitting a strait 10 foot putt on what appears to be a perfectly flat green, only to have the ball veer off at the last second causing you to miss the putt by an inch, then this game is for you. If you enjoy having your 5 wood shots, that normally travel 200+ yards, go considerably shorter when you have to hit over a body of water; again, this is the game for you.All that being said, for $10 it's a pretty darn good game."
3,good but unrealistic,it is a good game but the scoring of the computer is unrealisitc. in the 3rd tournament to get to the next level in the career there is no way you can be -8 after a round with almost 40 mph winds. gimme a break. i am currently frustrated as all hell with that. the best i can do is even par. if you dont play the career mode its good but if you do play it plan to be quite frustrated.
2,Dont Buy if you have a good computer,"I bought this game with high hopes that it would run well on my 2.4ghz 800fsb, 512pc2700 drr, and 9600pro card, but no. The game is plauged by frequent hangups even though I've intsalled all the latest drivers and patches. The graphics were nice in the space between the game running and freezing. Just wait for TW2004, maybe it will be able to run well on good computers."
3,Jimenes tremendo compositor de canciones,"Cuando descubrí a J.A.Jimenez vi la luz, la claridad para componer que posee este sujeto me dejo helado. Grandes letras y melodias son dignas de admiración para cualquier músico. Exelente disco recopilatorio."
1,A real stinker,This movie was terrible. Analyze This was funny. Analyze That was a waste of time. I think there was one part where I laughed but I don't remember. I fell asleep somewhere towards the end. Don't watch this movie.
1,Spare yourself.....,"This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. So dreadful that my wife and I stopped watching after 45 minutes. Don't buy it, rent it or think about it."
2,Disappointed with the sequel....could have been better,This is a great cast with a poorly written script. The humor is ok...I laughed pretty hard in a couple of scenes but overall it was pretty [bad].I am a big fan of De Niro and I think he gave a terrific performance and that goes to everyone in the cast as well. But I believe that the story could have been better developed and more well thought out. I didn't think a sequel was necessary. Sorry to say...two thumbs down.
3,Good film...weak DVD,"This sequel to the comedy hit, 'Analyze this', doesn't come close to the magic that the first one had. It's not as funny as that one, lacks its freshness and kills the fun of some of the jokes by repeating them too much (DeNiro's 'you...you, you're good you' lines).The situations are not as clever as they were in the first one, there's really no growth in the characters, and the story seems trivial at best.As for the DVD, not much to see here, only an OK documentary and a very weak trivia game. Even the menus aren't that good!Definetely a rental, but not really worth owning...if you ask me."
2,Not as good as the first one,"I had high expectations when I watched the first 10 to 15 min.of this movie. I liked the first one, Analyze This. However,I felt betrayed because it wasn't as funny as the first one.The story even [stunk]. It looked like the producers of thismovie wanted to leverage the growing demand for ""series"" butappears to be a failure.I won't recommend buying the DVD, it's just a waste of time andmoney."
3,A decent sequel but the original is funnier,"3.4 starsI liked Analyze This and got what I expected from its sequel, which is more of the same. It's a little more slickly shot, but suffers from most of the best gags being used up in the first film. Ramis relies on more ""danger"" for Crystal's character here, and it all comes off in a rather forced way. There are still plenty of smiles, but far less real laughs than Analyze This.It also lacks an actor of Chazz Palminteri's abilities to play foil to the DeNiro/Crystal duo, which takes away some potential edge. The interpersonal moments of the first film are missing here in favor of the ""action"" scenes, and it all adds up to less funny for the buck.If you loved the first one you'll probably like this one too, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you saw the first one already and enjoyed it.And let's face it: The Sopranos took the mobster sees a shrink idea and hit a grand slam with it. This is merely a single up the middle."
2,A few occasional laughs,"Original movie 'Analyze this' wasn't a masterpiece but was still decent. This sequel is worse. There is no enough materials here for Robert de Niro and Billy Crystal to work with (it's sad to see more and more movies with Robert De Niro that do not deserve his talent). I have seen already all de Niro facial expression in the first movie (where it was funny) and it just doesn't work for the second time. The plot is quite pathetic. Lisa Kudrow, unfortunately, doesn't do very well here. Overall, it's worth to watch only if you have nothing to do and no other movie is available."
1,A Minus 5 .....Twice,"Well its not often I fall asleep with utter bordom, but I did with this one *yawn*, 20 minutes into the movie, I hit the DVD player reject button, this Movie was so.o.oooo Unfunny and a boring piece of B-S , the DVD Cover's was the only good thing going for it, sorry Billy, Better luck next time :) ""Analyze this"" gets the big thumbs down as well, I couldnt even give the 2 DVD's away, Hmmmmmm Ohh well, I guess they make Good Coffee Cup Mats..... so not all is lost :)"
1,wack:the first one was Hit&Miss to Me overall,typical Hollywood to try to run another slot of Formula but this Film wasn't that Good the first time&this time out it has some funny bits but it's Clumsy&Corny on a whole.it just doesn't hold up&the acting seems forced&just there overall.Robert De Niro who is one of My Favorite Actors Ever hasn't had a Knock Out Film in Ages.He has gotten Corny for almost a Decade straight.Billy Crystal a Good COmedian who has had Moments has fallen way off as well.with these Two Cats you'd expect at least a Pretty Good film but this doesn't even come close.
3,Decent but forgettable sequel,"Trying to maximize on the wonderful chemistry and timing that made ""Analyze This"" really work, the producers here opted for a soft Part II that doesn't advance the characters or plot much at all. The writing is lazy, with a few laughs, but not particularly inventive. This feels like a ""coast."" By the end it devolves into a action/heist flick that banishes any charm that the movie might have built from the beginning. There were some potentially rich subplots here, but it all amounts to a less than memorable film."
3,the 2 knuckleheads are back again,"Crystal returns as DeNiros shrink as Crystal brings DeNiro home because hes recomended insane and crazy but DeNiro faked it and wanted to break out. DeNiro sings West Side Storys Im So Pretty and that tune got stuck in my head for a week and a half. but the highlight is when Crystal has a squid dinner after taking , I think it was a numbing substance and, you gotta watch it, its, it made me laugh so hard because his bottom lip is numbed up, he has squid in his mouth and hes trying to talk at the same time. doesnt have that taste that the original sparked but otherwise its good and Joe Viterelli as Jelly is great"
4,Better than expected but not as good as the first,"Every professional review said this movie was a disappointment. Just goes to show you that professional reviews aren't always right.This movie was funny, well acted and well timed. Many good lines, the addition of Cathy Moriarty (Gentile? I know the Gentiles!) to the cast made the movie better and she and DiNrio interact great.The return of Vitti to the street and the inclusion of his crew in a Mafia TV show are very funny. The Chinese restaurant scene was great but from the outtakes at the end would have been even better if some of the cut scenes were included.The ending is a little abrupt. It would have cost the movie 1/2 a star but the quality of the action and the actors keep it going.A toss up."
3,Schizophrenic script,"In this sequel to ""Analyze This"" Billy Crystal unwittingly helps his old pal Robert DeNiro escape from jail by declaring him mentally ill. Of course, DeNiro is just faking it by singing off-key renditions from ""West Side Story"". He is released into Crystal's custody and wreaks havoc in his household with his--shall we say--lack of social skills. This movie has its moments but they are too few and far between to match up to ""Analyze This"". There is no clear direction to the script and the writers seemed undecided as to whether the prevailing mood should be comic, dramatic, or whatever. This viewer felt a vague dissatisfaction at the end of the movie and thought that the comedic talents of two great actors were not well used."
4,"""Analyze That"" Review","I don't see the deal with everyone saying it's a bad movie. It's not bad at all, infact I almost perfer Analyze That over Analyze This. If you haven't seen this, I'd reccomend atleast renting it. It doesn't have as many 'laughing out loud' parts, but it still is a great comedy."
2,ok but not worth the money,"I bought this for my daughter for christmas and now, 2 months later, it just clogs up the corner of her room. The hair does not curl like it says. Ive even tried it and cant get it to curl either so i wouldnt really recommend this product"
3,Great Product & Even better price,With a fixed budget I didn't have a lot of choices for registers considering most were over $100. This one is compact & is a little difficult to get to back slot but works great for us. I ended up removing the bell because it was a bit loud for such a small place & it works fine with out it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone short on space & funds that needs a new register drawer.
4,Practice Drills for the Perfect Game,"Practice makes perfect - so goes the saying. This holds true in that wonderful game of golf. The Book of Drills teaches the golfer (of whatever skill level,from beginner to competitor) to hone on his skills and play better golf. One may also use it to aid a beginning golfer - a must for all golfers, especially instructors."
5,First-rate analysis of a critical issue,"This book is a delight - the author combines serious economic and political analysis with rich knowledge of institutions and history on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, he knows how to write. He makes sophisticated arguments seem easy. For readers concerned with the future of South and North Korea, this is essential reading.The book consists of a thorough overview of the current situation on the peninsula with a brief but insightful review of the historical processes that have brought us to this point. It distills in a accessible manner the vital insights from the author's formal models of the Korean economy. Most importantly, it weaves all of these different viewpoints into a coherent and persuasive story."
3,Quality is not the best,"These were running on closeout at $3.75, which I believe is about all they are worth. They are porcelain, and while the sayings are good, the workmanship could have been better. Specifically, the printing and borders are blotchy or broken in spots. If you are going to use them as Christmas ornaments, as I was, they are heavy."
1,sad excuse for realism,this game is poor quality and has mediocre graphics. Not interesting at all considering the quality of the other hunting games avialable such as cabela's big game hunter. Don't waste your money or your time on this game. I hated it.
3,"Great graphics, poor instructions",Come on who can read your mind on how the game is played? One should be able to skip the boorish intro and get to the game. Not worth the money in my book. There are little to no instructions on how to start the game let alone go from one stage to another. I want my money back.
1,Cuisinart DLC-DH Disc Holder,"I had it returned to Amazon, as it does not fit discs for the Cuisinart Elite 14-cup Food Processor."
4,blade keep,Such a senisible item to have if you have small children in the home. sharp blades are dangerous to all people so use this box to avoid grabbing sharp objects
4,Exactly as promised,"Not being a coordinationally gifted individual, I was tired of feeling around in the back of the cabinet for the processor blades and always finding them by cutting the $&@/* out of myself. This solves that part of my problem, nicely. I think I'll order another."
5,Fits perfectly,"Keeps counter neat and tidy, discs clean. Very happy with purchase, wish I had bought an additional holder for the discs that came with it."
3,Disc Holder,A bit bulky -- almost easier to keep discs in original packaging. But a very cool storage look.
5,Better than any makeshift holder,"Thought I would ""make do"" with something akin to a large index card holder (lol) but this works MUCH better, plus u can stack multiples. I like the protection it provides the pricey discs by not allowing them to touch. Worth it to protect the investment I have put into discs."
5,Great Organizer,"After years in the drawer, discs are finally easily retrievable. Have bought other style organizers in years past which were not up to the job. These work. Hold 3 discs each, which can be clearly seen through plastic door. These disc holders are stackable and have 'sticky feet' so they stay put. Door swings out allowing ez access to discs without unstacking.Holds discs only, not blades. Takes up more space than storing loose in the drawer but keeps discs protected, clean, and *available* for use. Design allows for labeling access door of similar discs with differing cut sizes (e.g., 8 mm vs. 4 mm slicing blades).Price seemed high to me but ended the frustration of digging thru drawer. Due to price, would give 4 1/2 stars if that option were available. Even so, I like them enough to round up instead of down. Product does what it is supposed to do - make things easier."
2,It does not fit the 7-cup blades,"Despite the description saying the container fits the 7-cup blades, it does not fit the 7-cup blades. Do not purchase if you have the DLC-5."
5,Does the job,"I love this disc holder. It looks good, the access door is cool & the stackability is a superb design idea."
2,I did not know it only held a few blades,Doesen't hold all the blades maybe I didm not read all the details but I thought it would hold all the blades
4,my Cuisinart disc holder,I would have given it 5 stars if it would have held more than 3 bladesI have more than 3 blades and I need to buy another disc holder because I'm going to buyanother blade. I'll have the big one and 2 small disc holders to stack. Cuisinart should makea 10 blade disc holder. If enough people suggest it maybe they will do it.
3,At least I have a place to put my blades,"keeps the disk blades (which are super sharp) in a safe place, however i have no place for the chopping blades or the kneading blade. what really ticked me off was that this product is included free with certain cuisinart food processor packages. that i had to buy this separately really ticked me off."
5,Baby-Boomers delight,"Le Creuset, where have you been all my life? Over the past two years, I have been replacing old items in my kitchen with several pieces of Le Creuset. All of the pieces have worked out very well. Recently, I ordered 2 of the rectangular dishes and have used them almost every dinner meal. They work great for microwaving vegies and are just the right size for freezing casseroles for two people.In the future, I plan to give them as wedding gifts. I'll include the dry ingredients along with my favorite receipe. They will make a great gift for the new bride."
5,Fantastic,I have several pieces of Le Creusent Cast Iron but this is my first Stoneware piece. I'd beeen using Pyrex for baking needs but after learning how unsafe Pyrex is (exploding) I decided to switch to Le Crusent Stoneware. I'm so glad I did. It bakes everything perfectly. Food seems to taste better and washup is so much easier than Pyrex. Washes easily by hand or in the dishwasher. I do wish it had a cover for storing like Pyrex does. It's more expensive but well worth it!
3,Passable Book,The book has several different styles. Some are very medeoker others are better. Have other ribbon books with more stylish items.
5,My son Went to bed with this book,This is my sons favorite book...as a matter of fact I just had to order another one because the first one is falling apart due to overuse.I got him this book for Xmas and he makes me read it to him at least 20 times a day!If Im not reading it...he's flipping through the pages looking at the pictures.He even takes it to bed with him.
5,great for kids who are just learning about trucks,"My son just turned two, and he has recently become fascinated with trucks. This book helps him put names with each truck, and he gets so excited when we see the trucks he has read about in his new book! This is the first book he asks for in the morning, and the last one he reads at night. He really loves it!"
4,The Pete Hamill segment Passable,"Pete Hamill is a well- known writer. He for years was a journalist but has also written a number of novels. Unlike his colleague Jimmy Breslin Hamill does not seem particularly blessed with an Irish outrageous sense of humor. He is a more bland- type guy. But the problem I found with his conversation with Charlie Rose is not so much in what he says, but in the way he implies it. He talks as an insider who seems to assume that everyone else knows and values what he is talking about. He talks about the foundations of New York City, provides the interesting fact that the life of the City until the nineteenth century was all in Lower Manhattan. He talks about the Twin Towers disaster and the novel he had finished just the day before- A passable interview but not the best."
2,A HUGE PAIN TO INSTALL,"I am amazed that it is not mentioned anywhere and no one commented on the fact that it needs to be HARDWIRED ! May be a common thing to most but not to me. If you think you can just plug it into your electrical outlet, forget it. The wires it comes with are very short and I think you'd need additional wires, holes, and knowledge of hardwire installation."
5,The Design Works Back To My Moen Faucet,"I recently installed a new bathroom faucet I received from the Vine program and was very pleased with the faucet which had a shiny chrome finish. The big box store had a sale so I decided to buy a towel holder, toilet paper holder, and a towel rack that would complement the fixture. Since I couldn't get an exact match for the faucet, I went with this design for all three items. They aren't flimsy, are well-made and attractive, easy to install, and easy to keep clean. I'm pleased with the results and glad I spent a little more for quality fixtures."
4,Great looks,This item actually looks better in real than in the pictures. It is easy to install and I do not forsee any problems with it. A good buy.
3,Towel Holder,"It's to hard keeping it hanging up on the wall. I wish I had order one with the screws ready to be attached.Thanks, Freida"
3,Special tool needed for install,"Not crazy about the plastic piece at the intersection of the ring and bracket. It looks cheap. Also, you must have a *very* small screwdriver to install. A jewelry screwdriver basically. The matching towel bar had one of the tiny screws that was almost impossible to loosen--very annoying. Could be better designed & doesn't feel very substantial."
5,Returning Happy Customer,"Just got done remodeling 2 of my bathrooms these towel rings are now in both my bathrooms. Both bathrooms also have the toilet paper holder that matches.It all looks real nice together. Also one of the batrooms have the matching glass shelf everything complements each other very nicely. I have one more bathroom to remodel so I will be back for another towel ring, towel bar, and a toilet paper holder a very happy returning customer soon for the third time. Thank you very much Shelly"
1,Beware of quality,"I purchased one in chrome and one in brushed nickel, with a matching robe hook for each. I had to re-order the rings in brushed nickel three times because of an inferior finish and defects in the plastic piece that holds the ring. (I re-ordered the ring in chrome only twice.) Each time, either the plastic piece holding the ring was sticking too far out of the base and was very obviously a defect, or there were marks, scuffs or blemishes on the base and ring. (In one case there were three large dents in the base of one robe hook, as well.) In a damp bathroom application, I am not purchasing fixtures with faulty finishes that could end up rusting. I ended up buying the same items at a large home improvement store and they were in perfect condition with a beautiful finish and nicely constructed. You might save a few dollars here, but you'll pay for it in the long run."
4,Brass Towel Ring,"It's difficult to find bathroom accessories in a polished brass, so I was pleased to find this towel ring to match our bathroom fixtures. It's sturdy and was easy to install. We've been using it for hand towels for several months with no loosening of the base or tarnishing of the brass."
4,Looks great but not quite the quality I was expecting,"This towel ring does its job and looks nice doing it. My only complaint is that when I ordered a Moen product I expected that it would be a bit more substantial. It is very light weight chrome coated aluminum, about the feel of something I would buy at Wal-mart. However the price was good, it looks very nice hanging in my bathroom, and does its job (holding a towel) well."
5,Easy install,This was very easy to install and looks really nice. If you have never installed any bathroom hardware then you might be confused for a moment but it goes on just like most. I gave it a five because I have not had any issues.
3,cheaply made,"These are pretty cheaply made, but once they are installed, they look and function fine. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Save your shirts and embarrassment at work...,I use this quite often while eating and watching TV or when I am forced to eat in my car or when I'm alone and drinking coffee on my long way to work. More than once I've spilled coffee or food or ketchup on my clothes...not any more. Just one slip up and this thing paid for itself by the avoidance of embarrassment.The dark paisley color is fairly inconspicuous in the car and it's quick to put on and take off with the velcro.
2,Makes my nails crack,"I wanted to get a polish that would nourish my nails, as they become dry and brittle from washing dishes, etc. I love China Glaze and was excited to try this out. The soft pink is very pretty and adds only the slightest hue. It also dries very fast. Unfortunately, I cannot leave this polish on for more than a week as it makes my natural, long nails crack and spit at the tips. I never had this problem before and am sorely disappointed."
2,worked...for a short time. annoying pad and connections,"this product worked fairly well and had a good loud alarm for about 3 weeks. then my daughter started complaining of false alarms. sure enough, when she rolled over or changed position in the bed, the alarm would sound. we tried changing the battery and jury rigging the wires, but nothing has worked. additionally, the pad that sits between the legs is pretty large and my daughter hated wearing it. to connect the alarm to the shirt, you have to stick the receiver to a piece of velcro that has to be pinned to the shirt. very annoying. I'm not impressed with the cheap construction."
3,Does not cover grey,"This does not cover grey at all and it smalls terrible, however it does improve the texture of your hair."
1,The Sojourner by Kenneth B. Frank,"The SojournerStill have not received the product. I would now like to have my money returned to me, as I had to purchase this book from another source."
5,SLEEPING BEAUTY,"""Kiss the Rain""? Sure! The song is classic and all the versions are worth hearing, but ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a true beautiful song you'll never forget.-- Ciccone4"
4,3.75 stars is what i'm feeling,"This movie isn't bad it was ok to watch but i wish Nick Cannon would stop taking rolls that put him back in high school even though he was playing an undercover cop as much as i watch i couldn't see him as an undercover cop..if he wants people to start taking him serious he can still do comedy and whatever but stay away from the high school rolls he is like 25,26 yrs old.."
2,Roselyn Sanchez the sexiest!!,"The only good thing about this movie is Roselyn Sanchez, she is fine and as far as Nick Cannon I can't stand him, he's not funny at all and tries too hard to be tough and I recommend not getting this movie unless you wanna see the sexy Roselyn Sanchez, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars!!"
3,Great Entertainment,"Granted that Nick Cannon is not the best actor, his charisma and sense of humor make a great addition to this comedy/action flick. The plot is good considering it's genre. It has everything a person who likes action movies wants. It has explosions, beautiful women, and sweet cars! This movie is definitely worth renting if not buying as well."
1,a Broke Beverly Hills cop meets the X Games,"this movie was like 10 movies rolled into One&none of it any good. Nick Cannon has some chemistry but it never has developed into much beyond what he did in ""DrumLine""(which was a decent film to me)&I like a few songs he has done over the years,but He ain't gonna ever abandon a singing Career for Movies because it ain't fully there.but this film tries way too many things&very cliche jokes,&themes. I did Love seeing Rosalyn Sanchez. yes Lawd she was the most happening thing about this Clunker.this film runs just like Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley's Blue Chevy did in Beverly Hills cop:slow&out of gas before it gets a chance to even get started."
1,Deliver us from evil,"I am embarrased to be a human being. I cannot believe this movie was made. It is the most worthless piece of garbage ever thought of and produced. Who let this slip by? This , my friends, is what is considered enterntainment in 2006. Who is Nick Cannon, and why does anyone believe he is an actor? If he's an actor, I'm about to make it big in Hollywood. Do not waste your time, people. For the love of god, I beg you!!!!!!"
1,id pay a dollar ......,to be at the meeting that greenlighted this pile of trash.what do producers think when releasing garaunteed flops like this ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? not even their target audience(jr high schoolers and trl'ers)will give this more than 1 star.
3,Nick Cannon as an undercover cop/student !!!,"Nick Cannon plays ""Tre"", a young detective who goes undercover at a preppy school. His goal is to catch a stolen-car ring in it's act.Roselyn Sanchez plays her role nicely as Karen Lopez, a teacher at the school. She stands out in the movie and is very sexy too.Cheech Marin is convincing as Tre's boss, Captain Victor Delgado who happened to work with Tre's father, who was killed in the line of duty. Tre and Capt. Delgado eventually form a bond after many ups and downs.Kelly Hu plays Lisa Brooks, a co-worker of Tre on the force. They have good camraderie throughout the movie.This movie won't be nominated for any awards, nor will any of the many actors/actresses. But it's not as bad as many of the previous reviews have made it out to be. Sure it's hard to believe Nick Cannon playing in the role of a detective. Even I have to admit he isn't fit for the role.Watch and see for yourself."
2,Nothing new,"There's nothing new in Underclassman. Not good plot, the acting is below average, and the jokes fall flat. It wants to be a mix between 21 Jump Street and Bad Boys, but it's really neither. It's made for teens, and I'm not sure if they'd even like it."
2,Do not waste your time!,"Bad, mediocre and boring - titles, locations, acting, wardrobe, premise for a film. It's embarrassing to watch this film, save yourself and rent another film."
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH INTEL CHIPSETS,"DOES NOT WORK WITH INTEL CHIPSETS. make sure the chipset that controls your SATA ports is not intel. on the manufacturer product page it lists an intel motherboard that it does not work with but made it sound like if you don't have that motherboard you are fine. turns out my ASUS has a similar chipset. this may work with nvidia i don't know. addonics says it will definitly work with a silicon image chipset, so i ordered a PCI card with that SATA controller. just a waste of a PCI slot because now i'm going to have more SATA than i'll ever need."
1,Does not work with linux either,"This product doesn't work with linux, despite manufacturer claims. Do not buy it if you plan on using linux (regardless of which chipset you have).Update (11/30): I reported this to their tech support on 10/17. They acknowledge the defect and claim that there is a new version of the device that actually works. On 10/23 they claim to have shipped it to me, but over a month later I have not recieved it. This has been an absolutely terrible experience.Update (02/02): The replacement arrived about a month and a half after reporting the problem, and it has the exact same flaw. I give up."
1,"Good Idea, TERRIBLE Product","First and foremost, the read/write speed on this unit was slower than my USB2 card readers. I tested it against multiple controllers, motherboards, HD targets, etc... but came up slower than USB2 every time.Next, it did not offer hot swap capability. You either have to reboot on a card change or go into the device manager and scan for hardware changes. Switching the SATA controller within the BIOS from IDE to ACHI did improve the stability of hot swap a bit, but still not flawless hot swap as a USB reader offers.Finally, the build quality of this isn't great. You have to be delicate inserting cards and it's a push button eject instead of a tension push/pull...and the push button eject didn't feel all that great, so doubt its durability.Sticking with USB2 for now until another vendor offers a SATA card reader or USB3 versions come out."
2,Don't recommend,"Could only get 37.2 MB/sec (39,000,000 bytes/sec) write/read speed, using the 45 MB/sec Lexar CF card. I was surprised at the bottleneck presented by the Addonics card, because it hooks directly to a SATA port on a very fast computer. Addonics claims the device is constrained only by whatever UDMA CF is used, which I now don't believe. I read/write to SATA disk at 68-70 MB/sec, so it must be the Addonics device that's slowing things down.Hot swap doesn't work, or at least I couldn't get it to work with an Intel 965 chipset and ICR9 2920 SATA controller. Consequently, you have to power down before inserting a new card in order for it to recognize the new card's parameters - a huge inconvenience. It doesn't work well with non-UDMA cards, either - it read my 133X write-accelerated Lexar at about 24X max. The 3.5"" form-factor tray was convenient, but the other hassles outweight that benefit."
4,Great product for the money,"Paid 699.99 CDN in ~April 2006. TV picture is just ok, DVD is great, haven't tried HD yet. Remote is a bit cheap but easy to figure out. hangs nicely on the wall. Needs a few more inputs. I'd buy it again given the same circumstances. Would have been nice to have HDMI but DVI is ok for now."
4,"Good TV, Decent Montitor, Jack-of-all-Traits.","I have been using the Viewsonic N2750 for about two years now and have nothing but good things to say about it. This TV/Monitor has served both purposes; as an HD TV and a computer monitor.As a TV, the color is full and quality is decent. Obviously we are not talking about a full-blown HD unit here as far as quality goes, but for our purposes, which is to move it around where we need it in the house (home office computer, family room tv fill in) this product fits the bill.As a monitor, we felt the picture was not as clean for use with our computers, but there are many options for hooking up devices and the viewing area is great.We give this product 4-stars for it's good quality overall and versatility."
4,"up to date, wide range and scientific yet readable book","this book fully covers the subject and gives all the scientific details in depth and up to date. many contributors and many graphics. few personal biases, discussion in a scientific style where other books are narrative / prosaic."
5,Freedom to walk!,"This Buddy System is so easy to use and so practical. With this leash it's a snap to regulate pace and reduce pulling. Since my hands are free, I can easily manage to pass out treat rewards, which my trainer recommended to do while walking--pretty impossible if you're holding a traditional leash. Nala, my chow German shepherd rescue dog, has definitely improved her strolling skills!"
3,great for walking NOT 4 running,"I own a siberian husky that loves to sprint and pull during the initial phase of our run. I don't mind this because he levels off as we continue to run, however; it puts pressure on my back because he is pulling and the leash is attached to my waist. Furthermore, the leash is not particularly thick and I question its durability. I will try the lunge buster attachment hoping that it will mitigate some of the discomfort. Ultimately this is a good product for walking your dog NOT running especially those with dogs that like to pull."
3,Ok novel on the consequences of incest..,"Will Aitken explores a sentitive area in this novel, father-son incest, and some of the book does shock, but Aitken doesn't make the most of it, and we see scenes that could easily be chopped out(The whole Japan part could have come out). I also could n't really get close enough to Daniel to feel for him. The way he acts and act out seems of of a textbook, and doesn't quite feel all real."
4,Good Stuff,"I thought I'd at least put up the track list for this cool EP from Mason Jennings.1) Living in the Moment2) Bullet (radio edit)3) Nothing (live)4) Emperor Ashoka (live, previously unreleased)Emperor Ashoka is what you are looking for, a great song about a Buddhist Emperor, look it up!!"
4,It would get full marks if it had more than 1 new song,"You can get most of your information from the above review, however, be warned that there is only 1 new song here, that being Grey Skies. Life is not a rehearsal is a remix of lifes an ocean off of a northern soul. However, this single is still worth buying."
3,"okay, but none too exciting","This collection of short stories has its moments. I'm a big fan of Weiss & Hickman - some of the other authors do an okay job of writing in the world of Krynn, but there's a certain loss with others, almost like it's a different place altogether. I would recommend this book for ""easy reading"" as the stories are none too deep or real ""page turners"" - not a bad book, but nothing to keep in my library."
4,Good Idea,"This was a rather interesting Book and I enjoyed it enough to seek out the rest of the series. In this book, we meet Sal Liquori. He's in high school and is considered Cool. He likes to think of himself as a Lady's Man. We also get a look at Hendra, a 13 year old punkette, and Max, an 18 year old Nerd. Never in a million years would these three know each other, let alone become friends... until one day at the mall a piece of Satellite fell into the fountain pool...Well, strange things begin to happen, there IS a reason why the series is called the PsiPatrol after all ;-) You would just have to read it to believe it.I wish they would have done more with this series. Sal's Book was Awesome, Hendra's Book was good, and Max's Book took me forever to read because the book is written how the guy thinks... Choppy and intellectual, but it is worth getting to the end.My recommendation? Give it a good read if you get the chance!"
3,"nice, but not for 2.8L VR6","This book is well written and covers things in detail. However, it does NOT cover the VR6 (2.8L) engine."
3,Okay.,I'll have to use my husband's opinion on this one. He did not find it very helpful. We ended up on a Chat site to get what we needed.
2,Not for the 2001 Cabrio,"I have a 2001 Cabrio. I wanted to find 2 things when I ordered this book: How to replace the fuel door lock actuator, and a picture of where to find the fuses. The fuses do not exist where the book says they are. The one reference to the fuel door lock actuator says ""See chapter xyz."" I read every word in the referenced chapter... not one mention of the fuel door lock actuator.Very disappointing."
2,Looks good but some parts don't fit my car,"I've used many Chilton books in the past, but this one was a disappointment. I set out to fix a faulty electric window motor on my 2001 Cabrio, only to find that none of the instructions and pictures in the manual simply match my car. Where the manual says ""clips"", I have hidden screws, etc etc et...The book was essentially useless... :("
3,"Not bad, Not good","These are not as bright as an incandescent 194 bulb. I also had some issues with the contacts on this, neither bulb worked when I first plugged them in. I had to keep adjusting the leads until they made contact with the socket I was plugging them into. This was not due to the polarity being reversed either.These will work well if you do not need a bright 194 bulb."
4,Aphex twin,"This is apparently an ""aka"" for Aphex Twin. The Aphex Twin-ness of it is obvious, but this work stands out and is destinctly different than works under the pen name ""Aphex Twin"". Not to berate this work, but it is more in a standard techno-electronic vein than that wildly erratic and experimentalness of aphex twin. However, this music is still a head trip by normal music standards. Aphex Twin always seems to be 1 foot across the line."
4,more good AFX,"Just another instalment of the AFX, back in the day, persona.If you liked anything he did with a computer you are in for a squelchy, repetitive, mind grasping good time. So many lo-fi drum escapades it makes my ears weep with joy. If you like this buy ""I care because you do..."" because they are almost the same album."
3,not the best bubblebath,i like analogue bubblebath 4 a lot better. most of the tracks on a.b.3 veer between mashed out acid madness and more synth-washy ambient relief. there are some good tunes here but also a lot of caustic-windowy crap that wears thin rapidly. give me the video game bounciness & graceful sighs & stutters of a.b.4 any day!
3,typical afx,"this album, while good, sounds like rdj(afx) when he is asleep!the disc looks innocent enough and the tracks titles, which are really bizarre, you can get off the net.he basically takes a good beat , loops it over and again with some other sounds and makes it a track.granted, some are really good, but some can also come off as slightly annoying.trust me, there have been better albums..."
2,Cultish exploits,"2 1/2Although this threadbare side project (credited as his first release of early compiled work) can yield admirable results, as when a few submerged bangers here seamlessly provide proper elemental chemistry to catch hardcore hypnotic fire, the good majority of AB3 grinds away needlessly, highlighting material only Aphex-addicts need collect."
4,A little help is better than no help at all,"If I read a ""self help"" book it indicates that there are major problems in the area! I would much rather read a novel, but we have had such a hard time with our, now 12, daughter that we were grasping at anything. This book gave us wonderful insight and let us know that we are not alone in parenting children with behavioral issues. I would recommend this book to anyone who is grasping at straws over the behavior of a child. My only sorrow is that I didn't hear about this book 5 years ago!"
4,Works well - feels fragile,"Having used other equipment made by Reliance Controls, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the digital circuit breaker finder. As noted by others, the transmitter is fine; the detector has a button that is on a hair trigger. Also, although the picture shows it in black, the unit that I was sent was a day-glo orange (which doesn't bother me, but might matter for someone else).That being said, the unit works extremely well. As the instructions indicate, make one complete pass over every circuit breaker, and then do a second pass. It hasn't made a mistake yet! I'd give it five stars if the detector was built more robustly. That, and inserting/removing the 9V battery should not require a screwdriver to open the compartment door."
4,Works Well,"It took an initial ""trial"" period to learn how to use it properly. After that, the Reliance Circuit Breaker Finder properly identified the correct breakers. Now my circuit breakers are correctly labeled."
1,I'm the only 1 star review,Unfortunately I am the only 1 star review which means I might have got a lemon. I bought it coz of all the great reviews and price. I put in the 9v battery and it turned on. Problem was it would not turn off. It beeps twice and stays on. Then after waiting an exceptionally long time (an hour) it might turn off by itself. The only other way I could get it off was to take out the battery. I hate that I am the only bad review. It makes me mad. I am returning it right now.
1,Another one star on my second and not any better,I bought this because the reviews looked good here. I was mislead. There are several of these under different brands but basically they are all the same. First off it works about 50% of the time. Ok better than nothing. Feels like a cheap piece of plastic. The worst thing is the on off button it keeps on getting hit in my tool bag so about 4 times a day there is a beeping from my bag. Then when you go to use it the batteries are low which now you need a screwdriver and 15 min to change. Whoever designed this with a light push button to turn it on never intended this to be traveled with or used i the field.
2,Hmmm,"To me this is kind of a 'duh' book. Of course marketing targets our kids, and of course if greatly influences them. Nothing new. But if it opens people's eyes that did not yet realize this, and especially if it changes their attitudes towards children and television/videos...then great-- it should be read."
2,Blah...,I love Jane Austen type movies and stories. This just wasn't up to snuff. If you like Jane Austen-y type books and movies I recommend Downtown Abby (love it!) if you're looking for a series to follow. Cranford just didn't have a good enough story line (boring!) it moves really slowly.
4,Good stories,"Though a little dark this is a good historical snapshot for the time it portrays. The rules of the day, behaviors, and social morès provide some depth to simple stories."
3,Not as good as others in this genre.,I did watched all the episodes. Enjoyed Judi Dench. Plots could have been better. But worth a watch as a way to relax in front of the TV.
3,Off to a slow start,"It was hard to get into the characters, time, and place. It was s-l-o-w in every respect; however, the characters do grow on you and if you stick with it, you are forced to slow down as well; you match your pace to theirs. Imagine....burning TWO candles after dark!It's well-written and beautifully acted. It seemed such a spot-on description of village life in the 1840's; it could have been written by Thomas Hardy.What a treat to see Carson (Jim Carter) of Downton fame as Capt. Brown, and Mary (Michele Dockery) as a laughing, long-haired lass!"
5,Cranford,"Really liked this, watched because Judi Dench was in it. Alson the neighbor Mr. Brown was also in the Downton Abby series asthe Butler Mr. Carson"
4,Nice show,"Always, always love Judy Dench. This is an interesting show, I like Jim Carson and all of the other cast members"
4,Cranford a quiet gem,"Cranford was an entertaining series with excellent acting and actors. The historical setting and, in particular, the medicine, was surprisingly accurate."
4,Great for family viewing!,Great period performances by all actors. The storyline really pulled you in and made you unable to wait for the next episode.
3,Cranford,"I watched the first episode of this British drama and, while it was entertaining to a point and the characters were each done well, it moved a little slow. I will watch the other episodes."
3,Cranford Review,I'm on my third episode ... at times I find it hard to understand the language. I think if I understood the historical period ... I would enjoy it more.KUJ
3,Well??,I couldn't get into this and I love Judi Dench. I'll give it another try and rating. When I started watching it I may have wanted something that grabbed me from the start and it fell short.
4,Entertaining!,"I love Judy she is a top, top actress. Enjoy her so much in ""As Time Goes By."" This is an entertaining story, while not at realistic and intellectual as ""Downtown Abbey,"" but heart-warming. Just started the series and will watch it all at least once."
3,English move,"I liked this part that I rented not as good as some but worth the rental, did rent another part from the same movie."
3,interesting,nice look back at diffeent time but a little slow. Worth a watch and at times very entertaining. put on the b list and hope for a winner
4,Such potential,"I loved the characters in this series and the acting was superb.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the writers really missed their chance.I think this drama/comedy had so much potential to become a huge hit. I felt like they rushed to end it.I was also sad to see Deborah die off so early in the series. She is another example of a character thatcould have added so much to the story lines...another Maggie Smith type as seen in Downton Abby.I was very disappointed that this series didn't evolve more but I did enjoy these episodes very much.I started to watch Return to Cranford, but so many of the characters disappeared and it had lost it's charm."
5,wonderful costume drama,"I wish the series was longer! The acting, costumes and attention to detail make it a must see if you enjoy period drama."
5,Cranford,"It is yet another wonderful series from Britain. Love, hate, sorry, happiness, life, and death. All these emotions and more are felt in this series. Enjoy."
1,NOT VERY GOOD,"I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE WAS RATHER SLOW AND IT MISSED THE MARK WITH ME. I USUALLY LIKE ENGLISH SPINSTER MOVIES, BUT NOT THIS ONE."
4,"If you're an Anglophile, this series is for you.","This pre-dates the highly-acclaimed Downton Abbey that is currently playing on PBS and BBC. It shows how people coped with living and loving in the more remote villages of England. Dame Judi Dench played a superlative role, as usual, and her supporting cast, including Mr. Jim Carter, was excellent. If you are NOT an Anglophile, you will not enjoy watching it."
5,Loved this series,This was addicting - I wish they had made more episodes. Judy Dench and all the others are endearing and entertaining.
4,Truly enjoyed this series.,"Although not as enjoyable as Downton Abbey, I did like viewing these memorable characters. Judi Dench was especially a very good lead and fit the bill perfectly."
4,Well acted!,"This entertaining period piece is a great British offering. The only reason for me not giving it a full five stars is simply due to the fact that there is a sad undercurrent, and I prefer more joyous fare. Still, it is well worth watching if you love BBC television such as Masterpiece Theater."
5,Beautiful!,"I loved every minute of it!!! Wonderfully done, with some of the best British actors of today! Has a Jane Austen feel to it."
1,Rather worthless,"1. The book was written in 1983 so it's more than a little dated.2. Hitching has NO credentials whatsoever in the field; he is neither scientist or biologist.3. Most of his other writing is on the subject of the paranormal, like dowsing and earth magic. Since he believes in these things his judgement and reasoning is more than a little questionable in my opinion. Scientific reasoning, method and thinking does not appear to be his long suit.4. Richard Dawkins who IS an expert in the field has the following to say: ""I know nothing at all about Francis Hitching. If you are uncovering the fact that he is a charlatan, good for you. His book, The Neck of the Giraffe, is one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read for years.""The book is all but useless."
4,Almost The Best,"""Descanso"" is the second best album this group produced, the best being ""Entre El Cielo y el Suelo"". What is significant in this album is the realization that of the two brothers, José Ma. is the better composer, and his songs dominate this recond. His songs ""Mujer Contra Mujer"" and ""Dalí"" are vastly superior to anything Nacho ever wrote and released with Mecano. These two songs, more than any other, offer the best qualities of Mecano. The beautiful melodies, the witty lyrics, the tasteful arrangements and Ms. Torroja's stylings. Beautiful.None of this is meant to denigrate Nacho Cano's work. ""Nueva York"", ""Un Año Más"" and ""Sol/Luna"" show that he is still the group's more adventurous arranger and a talent to be reckoned with, but the quality of his songs here do not match his brother's or even his own in ""Entre el Cielo y el Suelo"". That lack of balance is what makes ""Descanso Dominical"" inferior to ""Cielo/Suelo"""
4,Uno de los mejores albumes del pop español,"Si jamás has escuchado nada de Mecano, ""descanso dominical"" es lo que debes ir consiguiendo. Es un album repleto de buenos temas, melodías tan conocidas como las de ""mujer contra mujer"", ""amantes"", ""la fuerza del destino"" o ""por la cara"". Composiciones magistrales, tanto en arreglos como en la maravillosa voz de Ana Torroja (también es cierto que su registro se adecúa más a música romántica)MI tema preferido es ""Laika"", y los que menos, ""no hya marcha en NY"" y los 3 últimos. Pero aún así, sigue siendo un disco absolutamente imprescindible."
3,Good later yarn by Haggard,"Probably many people who have read widely in Haggard's works would agree with C. S. Lewis, who said that Haggard's later books are better written than the earlier ones, but have less mythopoeic power. My reading of 16 of the novels (so far) bears out the truth of Lewis's comment. Haggard himself claimed that his best work was done early one (say, King Solomon's Mines, She, Nada the Lily, Allan Quatermain, Eric Brighteyes, etc.) - - although it's been reported that he thought the relatively late Child of Storm was his best single book. (I don't know of any Haggard readers who would agree with that.)Anyway, Allan and the Holy Flower proved to be a fine entertainment. I rate it 3 stars because it isn't on the level of other books by Haggard; but as a ""good yarn"" it's well worth reading."
3,Lacked Excitement!,"With regard to one of the points raised in the reviews, I did not find the sound lacking in any respect. However, I limit myself to the simplest set-up so, as in other respects of my review, I am a listener not an audiophile nor expert in music or opera.I had few specific criticisms, rather I found the whole to lack weightiness, that is, as some like to put it, the production doesn't integrate the parts to provide the energy to lift one out of his seat. Neither the King nor his son electrify or fulfill the need to be regal. The scenic design reinforced the lack of stature and certainly undermined the credibility of the Gods.Overall, therefore, a routine production, not a failure, not a success."
2,Wonderful singing but disappointing DVD.,"The singing on this DVD is phenomenal, however, the costumes and sets are atrocious and some of the performers over act to the point that they are no longer believeable, especially Elektra. Was this opera actually presented at the Salzburg festival? It must have been produced on a really low budget."
1,The Feuilles de Brick were dry and had to discard them!,I was very displeased when I received the Feuilles de Brick. I had to cater for an important client. All the ingredients ready to be assembled in the Feuilles and due to their dryness (the Feuilles de Brick) I could not bake my desserts.
5,Beautiful Gift Idea,"I gave this book to a friend of mine for her 5th wedding anniversary. She loves journaling and was so incredibly moved and touched by this gift and said she and her husband really look forward to creating this memento for their son, as well as getting to know one another better through writing in it together."
5,truly for a lifetime,This book (get the second edition) is PERFECT asks ALL sorts of questions. Be prepared this book is THICK more than 400 pages probably.
2,Book ?'s Too Focused on Emotional Rather Than Factual Data,"I bought this book for my 62-year-old mother and my 95-year-old great-aunt to fill out so that I could keep a written document of their memories. Both separately told me the same thing - that the book asked far too personal of questions. Neither was willing to fill it out. It asked questions about their feelings about their childhood, feelings about marriage, etc. I had not wanted to record their feelings, but rather more historical type of data such as the cost of bread, the local scenery when it was all orchards, etc. If the book were full of more factually-based questions as opposed to emotionally-based, it would be more suitable.On the positive side, it is a beautiful looking book that would keep well for generations."
5,Wonderful and Beautiful Book,"THis is the second Lifetime Story book that I have purchased. I gave one to my father-in-law for Christmas last year (which he absolutely loved) so I decided to give one to my mother-in-law this year. When she looked through it, she felt that the book was not only beautiful but a fanastic way to share her life and story. THe questions in the book are detailed which will promote more thoughtout answers. You will love this book as a gift."
5,the gift of a lifetime,"I gave this book to my sister in law to honor her 60th birthday. It was not the most elegant or humorous of the many gifts she received that day but it was the one she kept picking up. She has 11 grandchildren who adore her. When they learn more about her I think she'll emerge as one of the most interesting women they'll ever meet.I think this an instant treasure,even more so since families are spread across the country and a text message seems acceptable as communication.No time to tell stories anymore...get this book for someone you love,who has a story to share."
4,beautiful for all ages,"bold, colourful illustrations and simple text create a whimsical, lovely story in which a brave, precarious elephant executes feats of mental and physical acrobatics.with the exception of some vocabulary the text is sparse and simple enough for young children (infant, preschool, K). the story also has a nice read-aloud rhythym, accompanied by the bold images that work so well when reading to that age.older children and adults may be disappointed in elephant's lack of facial expression. however, this did not detract from my enjoyment of the book -- the story ends with a surprising sentiment that had myself and a few of my fellow children's librarians discreetly sniffling...."
2,"Inaccurate, but with practice you can work out all the bugs","1) Supposed to contain recipes ""safer"" than the anarchist cookbook - never read it(edit: meant, that at the time I wrote this review I haven't read the ACbook yet, though now I have, but this review is correct, I read a copy of TM-31 before reviewing), but if this were true we wouldn't have anarchists anymore. Goes over some basic primaries, some of the recipes leads to unstable products, and mislabels them as high explosive2)Could go over more third world chemical sources3) Expanding on number 1, definitely could use more modern recipesHowever that said, its a pretty good book considering it's meant for untrained army operatives in the 1960's. Though outdated in today's terms, with the right amount of tinkering you can modify and perfect the methods in the book."
3,"Small Price, Small reprint","Good copy reprint. Cover and pages similar to original although smaller format. For reference, perfect. Not an original document."
3,Old military manual,It is authentic military information but it is made available to the public because a new updated edition has been published. At least that is my understanding.
3,Enough to show you a bit about the ins and outs of SCRUM,"The author describes Scrum through a series of personal professional experience while using scrum to manage projects throughout different kinds of clients and situations and tries to demonstrate what you should do if you find yourself in one of the situations mentioned in the book.While a really interesting reading, it gets a little tired as the book progresses through project descriptions and scrum concepts, after the third or fourth use case I was almost giving up.Still a good book and I would recommend it if you would like some nice introduction to Scrum."
5,Quick read that will inspire.,This book is worth every penny. After buying the first one I bought two more so that I could pass them around the office. It's thorough and inspiring.
3,"It's a great book, but you need more to become an agile project manager","I've read both of Ken Schwaber's books back to back. Schwaber underscores that a Scrum Master is not a project manager, so you need to be aware that there's a gap to be filled between what a Scrum Master does and expectations by a client around agile project management."
5,A practical book on the scrum process,"If you're the kind of person who demands technical books that weigh 15 pounds, with beautify layout and tons of white space, this book isn't for you.But if you want a straightforward introductio to Scrum, this is it."
5,One of the good agile book,I really appreciates this book. It can helps me knowing in depth in Agile development and how to organize team with Agile process.I love it.
2,Could be 10 pages long,"It does get the point of scrum across.I'm now a convert.But it could have been done in about 10 pages.The figures are laughable. They look like poorly enlarged bitmaps and rarely convey anything useful or intelligible. They will make you angry.The formating of the text is confusing and short on structure. It's as if the editors had never heard of bullets.Finally, the cost of the book is absurd for what could be condensed into a pamphlet.In summary, you can learn all you need about scrum from browsing the internet."
3,Not without value,"This book has been mostly a disappointment. It is sloppily written, repetitious, and doesn't seem to have a lot of points to make. I have definitely learned some interesting things about the scrum process from the book, but I feel like it could have easily been one quarter the length and still accomplished the same goal. The level of workmanship which went into this book is truly pathetic - the figures are horribly pixelated to the point where they are barely readable, and the editing was definitely subpar. This may be a book which is worth skimming, but I hardly think it's worth reading carefully."
1,Waste of money and time,"Bad quality video clips of indoor and outdoor soccer. Just random shots, nothing funny or even very good action. No dialog, just a bad music track. A total waste of time and money."
2,costume,"This costume was fun to wear to school. Durability is not so good; should be able to get a few wearings out of it if careful. The ""one-size"" is roughly equal to an 8 or small/medium. Because it zips in the back, the size can be an issue."
3,"Good writing, so-so story","I like Jacob's writing style, which is why I finished the book. But several times I got so annoyed and irritated with the main character's stupidity that I wanted to yell at her and strangle her (.... just a wee bit, of course). Also, there were a coupla too many abductions or almost-abductions happening to Kate, so the story totally lacked credibility (not that I expect toooo much of credibility in a mystery novel, it is for entertainment after all...).Alas, I will keep reading Jacob's novels, 'cause I know she can do better than this :-)"
5,Couldn't put it down,"This book is an interesting blend of police procedural, woman-in-jeopardy, and cozy -- and it works wonderfully. It's darker and more complex than the previous books in the series, which I've also enjoyed. The narrative alternates between Kate's narraton and that of Michael, her policeman S.O. This is skillfully done and adds rather than detracts from the story. Kate stops to help a young woman stranded by the road and discovers a body (the woman's husband) in the trunk. Just when Kate realizes she's made a mistake in stopping, the woman's boyfriend returns. They throw Kate into the trunk with plans to dispose of her along with the body. Just when I thought I knew where this was going (another ho-hum wom-jep), the story takes a twist (0ne of many) and Kate escapes, only to be later accused of murder herself. The book, particularly the first and last parts, radiate with suspense. I litterally couldn't stop reading"
5,Murder Among Strangers,"Jonnie Jacobs is a masterful writer who blends appealing, multi-faceted characters with page-turning suspense. While her previous Kate Austen books were delightful mysteries, this one brings the series to a new level of excitement with more plot twists than a reader would imagine possible. Any reader who thinks they know the extent of character Kate Austen's sleuthing talents, will appreciate again her strength and depth in every chapter as she finds herself in peril after peril. Love-interest Michael finds himself in peril on the job in this title, too. Anna and Libby continue to enhance the Kate Austen stories with their realistic personalities. Each Jacobs book tops the previous one, and I eagerly await the next one!"
3,Technical Info,"The book is OK, I learned some interesting things but it gets way to technical for me. I found the gun fitting information very interesting."
2,not a great discrption of product,will fit with modification . my 99 ranger xlt . bolts wont line up with out grinding bace to match old ones.
2,Returned Rode very stiff,Returned for riding to hard and reboundy. Not better than OEM worse. Bought cheap Monroematic plus and rides normal now. Also had bought Gabriel Utra Truck shock and it was worse than sensatrac Go cheap and u will get the OEM ride you expect.
2,"Eh, not much difference between the free version","Yes you too can go out and pay thirty dollars for a piece of software that is dwarfed by competing software, and is available for free on the website of the company. So what does it do? You can record media from off of CDs, and organize MP3s and Real Audio files on your computer. So nothing really special. However, the software also comes with lots of sample songs to add to your music collection. Eh, thats all I can say, get the free version, if you like it pay thirty bucks for it then."
4,Everything is better,"I bought this years ago. Tones on Tail's newer compilation has their only full length LP ""POP"" in it's original form, along with another disc with all their other collective output. The newer compilation has everything ""Night Music"" has and the sound quality is vastly improved, making this compilation pointless."
5,wonderfull chill out music,"This is a great album if you like to listen to music with the lights out and some candles lit. A real sleeper of a CD - the same guys from Love and Rockets created some beautiful, introspective sounds. If you haven't heard this album I can't recommend it enough."
5,City Grits is the greatest breakfast EVER!,"The PB&J Granola is simply put the greatest thing I've ever eaten for a snack or breakfast (and occasionally dinner :) There are just loads of nuts and fruit, and everything has a great crunch and tons of flavor. I eat 2/3 c. and I am full until lunchtime - keeping me from getting hungry mid-morning hard task for anything in the cereal family. This stuff is fantastic! DON'T MISS IT!If you live in Seattle, hit the Fremont Sunday Market for samples galore. Other favorites are Berry and Cherry Cashew. The Pineapple Ginger is good too and unique."
3,You can barely hear his voice.,"The reason I bought this particulair Vicious album was because the store didn't have another. It's not bad but you can barely hear his voice. It's a live recording and the vocals are buried under the sound of the band. It does include the studio version of ""My Way"" but you can get that elsewhere.The high point has to be the little 5 minute interview at the end of the album. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone besides completists."
1,Problems with theses bowls,They develop a white crust inside that cannot be removed.I feel they are unsafe. The white crust looks like plastic that could chip off into food.
5,The Holy Spirit-the key to spernatural living,This is a great down to earth exlanation of the Holy Spirit and His place and purpose in the Trinity. I love the book and it has given me great insight and encouragement in my walk after the Saviour.
2,A skimpy manual???,"What manual? I ordered this for my husband, a huge Civil War buff, and thought he would love it. Unfortunately, there were no instructions. He can't figure out how to even play the game. We were very disappointed. I would not recommend this game to anyone."
3,Here is the Coral Reef,Purchased this to replace the one we lost from the public library. Kids liked it and it helped them learn the reef life. Mom went a little crazy with all the repetition.
4,Gripping!,"This was an ""Impulse Purchase"" because I was intrigued by the jacket blurb (imagine!) and it did not disappoint. It was great to read a novel where the woman/wife was the villain for a change.It would make a good movie!"
5,Psychological thrillers are my passion,This one is great. I'm loving it and can't put it down. I love what Newsweek said about spilling out into your lap.
3,3.5 stars - recommended,"This is suspense, not mystery-no body. It is an unusual and intriguing story that involved me at the first page and I read straight through. It wasn't as suspenseful as I'd have hoped in that the deceit unraveled fairly quickly. But it was very well written in the first person with humor and introspection from interesting and fully dimensional protagonist."
3,"Interesting story concept, but...","I think it would have been much MORE interesting if written from the wife's perspective. She would have been able to show us the tension of such a life and the fear of being found out.Now let me tell you how I came to read this book. A person who claimed to be the author contacted me by email. They stated they had read a couple of my reviews (on Dean Koontz books, which were rather harsh, I may add) and thought that I would enjoy this book. It was something of a challenge, I guess. One of those ""my book is better than their book"" claims. In this case, they were right; although the books I was comparing this novel to were a couple of the worst books I have attempted to read in the last few years. So, short of being garbage, this book was bound to win the challenge, and it did......it just didn't win by much..."
2,Save Your Money Entire 341 Pages sumarized in one paragraph,"This book should have been called, become a vegaterain and loose weight. Eat only raw veggies or cooked ones with no toppings except non fat dressing. You can eat as much as you want as long as it's vegetarian. There is no need to count calories on this diet. Don't have milk, eggs(not even egg whites), butter, oil(not even olive oil), nuts or anything else that tastes good and you WILL loose weight. It works but no need to buy the book this short summary should do the trick."
1,This book says nothing new,"Let me help you in your selection by summerizing this book. To lose weight, simply eat as much vegetables and fruits and grains as you want but do not touch any dairy, meats, or fats. There you go. If you get really hungry, stuff yourself with pasta or potatoes because it doesn't matter but if you do not agree with the author he has a simple answer, 'You are confused and do not understand!' The only other reason to purchase this book is to read the author's silly analogies and opinions that have no references to scientific fact. This book and the rest of the author's publications are just regurgitations of the old 'no-fat' diet. Buy the book if this is what you are looking for. As for me, I wish I had known the author was an extreme vegan for then all his opinions would of made sense and I would have gone to a more fact-based source."
2,Foods for Weight loss,"After reading this book, I think the doctor is suggesting that everyone become a vegetarian. There are no magic foods that cause you to loose weight and this book suggests that if you want to loose weight you should stop eating all meats and just eat the vegetables that he suggests. Everyone already knows what causes overweight and throughout the entire book he emphasizes everyone to go vegan."
4,An excellent PART of losing weight,"I was initially very excited about the concept of the negative calorie diet, as it gave me the impression that I'd be able to shed pounds while eating as much as I wanted. But the truth is I still felt hungry even when eating tons of vegetables. For anyone that uses this technique, I also suggest listening the the program at mc2method.com/LoseWeight which is really what I needed to get past the constant hunger that was causing my weight problem."
2,another extreme diet,"the book is not that bad, but definitely not worth the money. Dr. Barnard wants us to be vegans. No meat, no poultry, not even olive oil. Also, he says the the fat in tuna is ""bad fat"" which is not true. The list of negative calorie foods that he provides is rather short and can be obtained on the internet for free. If you think you can be a vegan, the book is for you, otherwise save your money."
2,"Excellent Amazon service, but poor book","The book is something interesting, but with no novelty at all. Some old ideas are presented, and there is no data assuring what the author suggests."
2,Become a vegetarian,"All I can really say about this book is that it tells you to become a vegetarian. If you think you can do that, then you should get this book. All of the negative calorie foods are vegetables and fruits. If you can live off of that then you will lose weight."
2,Hype. No more.,I read the book. I was not impressed. There isn't really anything useful in the book that isn't commonly available info online.Most of the book is menus ...
1,Does more harm than good for some of us,"I am already on a lean protein and vegetable diet. I was given this book, and started to read it. I stopped reading it and put it in the yard sale pile when I got to page 18, where Dr Bernard stated emphatically, ""carbohydrates boost your metabolism.""I am one of those people that carbohydrates have the opposite effect on me, especially those found in grains, pastas and rice. Instead of boosting my metabolism, these carbohydrates bring it to a standstill. When I eat carbs, I feel bloated and lethargic, NOT energetic. If I were to do as he suggests and eat loads of pasta, rice, baked potatoes, etc., I'd end up weighing twice what I do now.Be warned that a high carb diet may work for some - even most people - but for those of you who DON'T feel like running a marathon after eating a plate load of pasta, avoid this book at all costs and grab a copy of The South Beach Diet instead."
4,Easy-to-follow for successful weight loss.,"This is really a beginner's guide to becoming a vegan, but it is healthy eating, too. I felt so much better after following the suggestions in this book for a month, and I lost 5 pounds with hardly any effort at all, which at my age (56) is substantial and healthy weight loss. I was never hungry, and I didn't miss eating meat or dairy after the first week."
5,"Easy ready, full of information.",I found this book easy to read with some great ideas on how foods affect us and how they can promote weight loss. Recipes are easy and tasty!!
1,Not true. Results are subject to your body type,"I was excercising and following a protein based + minumum carbs diet. My goal was to reduce fat and cholesterol. I read this book and decided to give it a try.1.- If you are planning to become a vegan this may work for you.2.- Even though carbos have no fat, your body converts carbs into sugar for energy and sugar becomes fat.I gain back 2 pounds in a week! Not only that but I grew back 2.5 inches of belly!!Carbos have been always a problem for me. They surely store in my belly. I was excercising at the time I tried this diet. I was at the gym 3 times a week for at least one hour.This messed up my fitness program big time. I had to started all over again.I know some people that had become skinny with this program but MAKE SURE YOUR BODY TYPE will respond to this program before you start. You may be dissapointed. Check with your doctor."
5,Easy to Understand!!!!!,"Easy to read and understand...the writer truly understands his audience. Makes it easier to change your lifestyle. The best part is the menu chapter...you'll love it because it is also a ""how to"" book. Love it!!!!!"
2,Become a vegetarian and save yourself the trouble of buying,"this book. I don't understand the other reviewers, it's as if we received two different books. I am well read on food combining, fasting, vegetarianism, etc. and found this book to be one of the worst. Negative calories is a plausible concept but don't look to this book to really help you. You'll feel ripped off just by thumbing through the book. Just eat your veggies and cut out all that red meat and you'll do wonders for yourself."
2,Foods That Cause You to Lose Weight: The Negative Calorie Effect,Not a book you would like to spend money on to learn how to eat healthy. Watching Dr. OZ would be more helpful.
2,Misleading Title,"This book should have been called ""Foods That Cause You to Become a Vegetarian"". It's all about how bad animal products are for you and why you shouldn't eat meat or dairy products. The menus and recipes in the back are 99.9% vegetarian. If 'broccoli burritos' make your mouth water, then this is the book for you. I fully understand that meat doesn't have a ""negative calorie effect"", but there should have been a disclaimer that this book was from the vegetarian point of view and it wouldn't contain any information about how to integrate ""the foods that cause you to lose weight"" into any diet. However, the book was fairly inexpensive so it's hard to complain too much ...."
3,"If you like meat, keep away","Dr.Barnard wants to be a vegetarian. That's all!I am sure that it will work, but I think it's not honest not telling us that his ""diet"" is vegetarian, because people like me would never have bought the book had they known."
5,One of the BEST books for parents of adult children!,I have read and re-read this book over the adult years of our son's life. It is not just instructional but also very encouraging to parents at a time when their children are moving away from dependence on them. I have given copies of this book away but always keep one for me! You won't be sorry if you order this book!
4,3 stories in 1,"This is a collection of 3 related stories that all involve the same characters. Sophie and Annie are sisters. In the first story Annie, the big sister is taking a cooking class and must fix the family some meals for practice. Sophie doesn't like the foods she serves because she mixes things together and Sophie doesn't like that at all! In the next story Annie wants to study so she tells Sophie to find something quite to do. Everything she tries ends up being noisy! Finally in the third story Sophie wants a pet because Annie has one. Find out what unique pet the sisters decide on in the zany picture book.Each story was short. These would make a great bedtime read!I would recommend the book. Kids who have siblings will be able to relate to the characters well."
5,Hilarious book about sibling differences and children with sensory defensiveness,Very entertaining book - had both my kids (a preschooler and a schooler) in stitches over the illustrations. I recognise many traits of sensory defensiveness as well - and children with oral sensitivities and auditory defensivess will definitely relate to this book. Thumbs up!
5,Jill Thompson has done it again!,"The Scary Godmother is one of the most unique characters to burst upon the scene in a long time. Ms. Thompson's second offering ""The Mystery Date"" is a grand adventure. She has a wonderful knack of developing ""scary"" characters and making you love them! Our darling Hannah builds on her relationships with Skully Pettibone, Bug-A-Boo and the rest of her friends, and adds more acquaintences to her circle.What a treat to see another side of Scary Godmother, a side we can all relate to. Is it possible? Has she become even more endearing to the reader?Just read ""Mystery Date!"" It is great for adults and kids alike.Keep 'em coming, Jill."
5,Buenisimo,"Cuando de Juan Gabriel se trata, la calidad de su trabajo es el 99 % del tiempo de gran calidad. Debo hacerlo no es la excepcion. OGK."
3,Not exactly as described.,"The large print on the box says ""Alloy USA."" The small print says ""Made in India.""The shafts that I received were NOT drilled for the dual bolt patterns as claimed. Featured 5 on 4.5 bolt pattern ONLY.Supplied bearings were Timken, Made in USA. Seals were from Taiwan and much inferior to the OE seal.No axle retainer plates were furnished. That means you need to remove and reuse your old ones or buy new ones.The supplied wheel studs are substantially longer than the OE studs and might be too long for some styles of closed lug nuts.All in all, not the level of quality that I had hoped for."
5,Great!,Just like I remembered from when I was a kid and even had the old VHS quality to it. Great way to bring back those 80's memories!
3,Would be good if it worked,"My husband has 2 videos of Teddy Ruxpin leftover from his childhood, and we were so happy to finally be able to find out what happens in the rest of the series. But...We made it through maybe 3 or 4 episodes before it started skipping uncontrollably. We got so frustrated with it that we turned it off.We have tried everything...even went out and bought a new dvd player cleaner. Nothing has worked.The first disc has wierd shaped ""swirls"" on the shiny part. You know how you can look at the shiny side and see faint rings/grooves? Well, these are sort of oblong and odd shaped. We think it may have something to do with the skipping. But the second disc looks fine and it skips also.I would say, you could take a risk and try this for yourself. Maybe we just got a bad set.It is nice to be able to watch this series. And our boys find it exciting and adventurous. Our 3 year old asks about it often. So it is still relevant to today's kids."
4,ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL CHAPTER IN METAL HISTORY,"Destruction are indeed one of the most important metal albums of all time.birthed at the genesis of the thrash metal explosion,these Germans where a cut-above most of their peers.Sentence of death was a decent introduction,but somewhat cheesy in their lyrical attempts at evil(a trait most like-minded bands from that era shared).the music also shows a band with promise,but ultimately from its ""time""all things change with their follow-up ""infernal overkill"" -this is classic,timeless metal.ne0-classical arrangements coupled with an unrelentless thrash attack.very,very catchy - you will not be able to get these tunes out of your head for days.a promise!!!"
4,Great item!,"Nice item at 1/3 less than many other retailers. Quick shipping at a reasonable price, I wish they carried more items like this, I would certainly buy again from this merchant."
1,Arrived crushed and worthless !!!!!!!!Am absolutely stunning hat if properly packed,"An absolutely stunning hat if properly packaged. I own a half dozen from other retailers, but I ordered 2 more from the Golf Warehouse through Amazon.com, simply because they had the best price. However, they came in a box more the size of an oversized shoe box!!!!! The hats arrived crushed and completely bent out of shape!!!! They were so completely bent up that I tossed them in the trash. I was more than willing to eat my loss. I absolutely insist on a brim and crown devoid of mashes !!!!!!!!! I will NEVER buy from them again.............and you can take that to the bank !!!!!"
2,Bad shipping,"Box was smashed, had to moisten hat and dry to get wrinkles out. All could have been avoided if company had responsible packers. If not for that it is a nice hat."
4,Good,Keeps you shaded and cooler than most hats. My only complaint is that I have already made a hole in this one(my second one). Comfortable to wear. Will buy again.
5,Nice stylish hat,"I bought one a few months ago for the summer. I thought I would be using the hat well into the fall after the weather last year in coastal New Jersey stayed warm into November. Caveat: IMHO, you might try ordering one size smaller. The sizing charts recommended a large or even extra large, but my best fit was a medium. If the hat is too big it will sit on your ears and come down too far on the brow. The hat looks best off and above the ears. Google for some images of men wearing straw hats and you'll see what I mean. This hat is a definite ""Buy""."
2,Shipping/Packing Problems,"Well, I read the reviews and knew there could be shipping problems with this company and sure enough that's exactly what happened to me. It's obvious that the person packing this hat does not know how to properly pack this item or just doesn't care. Packing material was put at the bottom of the box and then the hat was laid on top. The hat had to be pushed down to close the top of the box, which bent the hat at the top and at the brim. You would think The Golf Warehouse would have fixed this by now! I will be shipping this back for a full refund. At least they didn't give me a hard time about returning it."
5,Ted from MS,Just got the hat and loved it. Mine came from Del Monaco and it was packed fine.I wear a XL and it fit perfect. I do have a large head with alot of hair still. I could see some folks saying it runs a little large but if you are a XL then you willbe fine.One thing I also noticed is that I just wore it for 9 hours in the sun and there wasnot a sweat mark on it the next day which I have noticed with many of my others. Itis a very nice up scale hat that can be worn to many events. I took the leather strap off myself because I was in a more upscale situation...Not good for travel unless its on your head.
5,Enjoyable reading with a solid message.,Excellent read in an evening. Worth the effort for anyone who deals with people.
5,Passion Reignited,"If your business sizzle has fizzled, then read this book. You'll reignite your passion and re-energize your purpose. Don't wait - read it now!Susan Bock[...]."
5,Fred Factor,"The Fred Factor is a great book for anyone in Customer Service. It ignites a passion that in this day and age, needs to be ignited."
5,Quick. Easy. Practical.,"Sanborn's easy-to-read writing style, together with his wit and humor, make ""Fred"" a fun read with today's-world application.I especially like the chapter where he talks about ""creating value"". Mark writes, ""Freds either create new value or add value to the work they do."" Very well said. That idea is a true game-changer."
1,Really stupid. I would laugh all the way to the bank if i wrote this.,"The company I work for required I read this before a seminar. Five minutes into this I was thinking to myself ""are you kidding me?"". This guy is making money off this?! I got on here to read some reviews about THE FRED FACTOR! Heheh. Haha. And surely SOMEONE had to be feeling the way I am. There is! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,simple tips on how to make the life around you better by working on yourself first,"decent book using stories about a USPS delivery man who changed the lives of others around him by his demeanor, character, and way he treated others. nice lesson on changing the life around you by focusing on improving yourself."
4,Another interesting book...,"While this book won't give you the courage to make sweeping changes in your life to ""follow your passion"", it does a credible job of describing how important it is to provide an outlet for the passion and creativity in your life."
3,"Good stuff, but a lot of filler","It's basically about considering service - either to mankind or to customers - as your life's work. I didn't really get lots from this - it basically read like a magazine article or short speech padded out into a few more pages.Would probably work for your typical corporate hour long training session, but I kind of felt it was wasted time for me."
4,Fred Factor,I love the concept but feel the heart of it didn't require the whole book to explain. A friend had told me about the Fred book and I truly enjoyed it. Just felt it didn't have enough content for an entire book.
5,Enlightening Read,I really enjoyed the lessons learnt in 'Fred Factor'. They are relevant for each of us at a personal and professional level. If we were all 'Freds' the world would be a whole lot better!!!
4,Good concept. Easy read.,The Fred Factor reminds each of us that we need to give exceptional service to everyone in our lives from customers to co-workers to our own families.
4,Fred Factor - help my Finance Dept give great service,"This book is such a quick read and inspires us to give the best to our customers. My group is a Finance Dept and our customers are almost all internal company ones. It is so easy to just do the same day after day.I bought this book for all my staff to read and use to accomplish their annual goal of ""Being the Best Dept to work with in our Company""Recommend it to everyone & make your life so much more positive."
3,FWD:FWD:FWD:FWD:FWD Read This,"I agree with the sentinements that this book contains too much filler and not enough content.The message is a good one, it's just unfortunate that it reads like a chain e-mail forwarded from my mother or aunt. I was seriously bored after about 10 pages, and really could absorb the entirety of the book in 10 minutes of skimming.If you're really desperate to read this, just browse it at your local library, assuming they carry it."
3,Entertaining more than instructional,"Not much in the way of ""how to do it"". But, full of great stories and examples.A good book for a company to buy all their employees."
1,What a tool! My child could write this,"Had the misfortune to sit through this authors canned motivational speech recently. He is a total throwback to the eighties, dress, mannerisms, material. From a beginning that was insulting to me as a member of a political party other than his, to the middle which was insulting to me as a teacher, to the end, back to politics again, he gave 6 trivial points of advice and mostly plugged this ""book""and his other efforts. Save your money and find another book by an author who has made the leap to the new economy and the ""new normal"""
1,One more book to help corporate America,"Oh my, one more motivational speaker, one more book about helping corporate America pad its pockets while its workers are supposed to ignore the core greed and put a smile on their faces and be Freds while the big shots benefit. Sorry, this just doesn't resonate with workers today who see their ""profit centers"" being sucked dry by the big home office and they are supposed to chin up and be a Fred regardless of the way the big boys (and ladies) are destroying the company they work for. Let's hope Fred is still practicing the Fred Factor when he shows up at WalMart or Dollar General looking for a job because his work has been outsourced, his branch consolidated or his job merged with three others.Sorry, but if managers and CEOs want more Freds in their workforce, they need to set an example first. If there aren't any Freds in your trenches, it probably because you don't have any in your corporate offices, either."
4,Great Short Read,This book got straight to the point.What I got from it was whatever you do doit to the best of your ability.Somebody will take notice and appreciate yourpassion and dedication.This short book makes you gauge yourself and how youdo things.I can appreciate a good story and Mark delivers.
5,Required reading for company- so glad it was!!!,"The Fred Factor by Mark Sanborn was required/suggested reading for an upcoming corporate meeting. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself interested in this book and in fact journaling areas of focus I wanted to incorportate as I read along. Mark Sanford does not teach new concepts through The Fred Factor, but in fact, reminds us of many things we have forgotten (or simply ignored in our daily lives). Most of what Mark teaches us is that by serving others we are the winners in the end. Becoming the better person we were intended to be results in a happier outcome for ourselves. Embracing these forgotten concepts a little each day could improve a person, a family, a company, and a nation. Read it and do the self reflection it will force you to do! These concepts apply to everyone in any position in life."
4,The Fred Factor,Easy Read. Well Written. Reminds you of the basics that we need to revisit often. I am in sales and have purchased copies for my customers. They too appreciated a good customer service book.
5,Great book to encourage those who have served you exceptionally well,"This is one of those very wise yet simple and encouraging books about how to serve others uncommonly well in an ordinary seeming job. Fred, and ordinary postal carrier doing an extraordinary job right here in Denver serves as the focus of this exceptional true parable.I give this book as a gift of encouragement anytime I have the priviledge of being served well, whether it is the bank teller downstairs who finally cleared up the error in my account after several others failed, the waitress with the warm smile every morning at the all-inclusive resort in Costa Rica, or the insurance claims person who solved the problem for one of my clients. The book has encouraged me as well as I strive to serve my clients better. It is worth reading again and again."
5,Inspiring!,"Many Americans are unhappy because they were never raised to be a ""Fred"". No wealth or possessions can make up for an unhealthy and usually self centered attitude in life.Choose to be a ""Fred"" and start living with and giving much joy!"
1,dont know about product it is late,I am concerned about this order because the person I sent it to has not received it and tracking information leaves me wondering what is going on and why it has not been received?
5,"KANSAS CITY, MO A humurous look on life . . .","I accidntly stumbled on this book at my aunts. It was buried under hundreds of of other books, but rather stood out being a hardback. At every minute I waws laughing with Ellie and crying. It's a very realistic book with twisted characters and ATTEMPTED murder wich proves to be interupted. I definatly recomend it and will be looking forward to reading more of her books."
5,Refreshing heroine,At last a leading lady that the average woman can relate to. Ellie Haskell is an smart woman. She is not afraid to say what is on her mind no matter the content. She addresses issues that plague the ordinary woman such as eating and exasperation with one's man and impossibly nutty relatives. Dorothy Cannell writes a clever and entertaining book that runs smoothly. Ellie saves the day not doing impossible stunts but every day activities and can be related to by all of us ladies that are bigger than a size 8.
3,Needs new editing,"I found this book to be enjoyable though not as funny as other reviewers. It was a light hearted and fun read if you can overlook the many, many editing mistakes. I am able to understand editing porblems in the free books by little known authors, but when paying $7.99 for a popular author book I find it deplorable!! While the storyline was good I was upset every time I found another editing mistake that I had paid what I did for this book!"
5,Perfect for any hatchback.,"I'm using it with an alpine 9843 and a couple of memphis 6.5"" in the front and it sounds like a competition system.It amazed me when i opened the box and noticed that it was bigger than i expected. For a 10"" sub and for its price and functionality i don't really have any complaint at all."

2,Tablets Taste Disgusting,"Before giving these vitamins to my picky son, my boyfriend and I decided to guinea pig ourselves. I GAGGED after chewing two tablets, my boyfriend screamed for water. So, I'm not sure if the wafers are a better route to go. My son will not eat these. I'm going to try and find a way to hide these in his food."
1,attentive child tablets for focus& memory,"Did not work at all whatsoever. Waste of money, heard really good reviews about this product tried it, and didn't even see the slightest difference. Would not recommend waste yime, money, nor efffort purchasing these."
1,Attentive Child TABLETS,"Source Naturals Attentive Child, 120 TabletsI was under the understanding that these tablets, FOR KIDS, were chewable. And, after reading review saying that the new smaller chewables were more sour than the older wafer styles, I ordered these - thinking that my little one likes sour flavors. Well, do not be confused, as I was!!! These CANNOT be considered chewable! The tast is absolutely vile. I love my child too much to force these on her. It would be child abuse, to say the least! These are going straight into the trash. I will see about ordering another brand, or getting the old-style wafer that I mentioned earlier. DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU WANT A CHEWABLE TABLET!"
4,Good adapter for home and car use,"The power adapters work great. My son can play at home or in the car without using lots of batteries. The rechargable batteries are also good. The only problem with this kit and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that you can't use a light with it. If you plug in a light, the game goes off because it is not getting enough power. Other than that, this is a great product."
2,A beginner's guide,"The sub-title of ""A complete guide to tracing your ancestors in the Germanic areas of Europe"" is rather misleading. It is not ""complete"" by any stretch of the imagination.This is a very brief introduction (103 pages of text) to a very large topic. Some aspects of German research are treated in only the most cursory manner - the Lutheran church covered in a chapter of a single page while the Germans in Canada are dealt with in only 3 pages.The section on German record types leaves the reader wishing for more information. Which is the feeling the entire book gives ""I wish there was more here"".While this book has been updated to reflect the reunification of Germany, this is not Angus Baxter's best book. His ""In Search of Your British & Irish Roots"" and ""In Search of Your Canadian Roots"" are much more comprehensive in their scope. Because this book compares poorly with his other works, I have given it only two stars."
1,Noooooooooooooooooo THANK YOU!,"This is the first rotten apple I've found among the earlier Verve singles. All the potential weaknesses of the band (and/or just Ashcroft?) ache in flaming boldface on the nonalbum tracks. As the sad and sloppy reincarnation of half a dozen other Verve songs, Ashcroft goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on ... by the dreaded 'Dance On Your Bones' either you'll think the disc is smoothly skipping or you're just waiting to hear a gunshot from an enraged member of the audience or studio to make it stop. (Eeeeeeeeep!) And thank goodness they finally *did* stop before things came to so drastically nasty a fate as that. Those who found many of the Ashcroft ""mantras"" on ALONE WITH EVERYBODY unnervingly repetitive (CMCS: circumlocutory, moaning cow syndrome?) will find this single just agonizing."
3,cute,This is a joke book filled with animal jokes.The pictures were fun to look at. They were next to each joke. The book was fairly short and easy to read.Yes we would recommed this to others. A fun joke book recommended for all ages.

4,enhance your spiritual life,"I spent several years using the 12 steps and 12 traditions of AA as a basis for spiritual guidance/life answers, and was greatly benefited by it in my recovery life in AA. I was interested and am pleasently/presently satisfied with what the material in the book has done for my spiritual life."
3,Not what I expected...,"I was not familiar with the way any of the ""Anonymous"" programs work when I bought this book. I suppose that these steps may work for a lot of people, but it is exactly the opposite of what I was looking for to help with my compulsive overeating. The main idea behind this book, in my opinion, is that you need to let a ""higher power"" take control, and then create a loving and fulfilling relationship with this ""higher power"" to overcome your problem.I am not religious, and I do not believe in any god/higher power or in ""creating"" one just to get through these steps. I want and need to believe in myself, and that this is a problem I can overcome without depending on something else.There were a few helpful things here and there, so I gave this book an average review."
1,BS,As a man who lived through the generation myself; i found this book a disgrace to our times. Judith Coplon was innocent and prejudiced against because of her religion and gender. The book is severly baised. Judith Coplon was as guilty as the moon is made of cheese.
5,Not Mere 5 star,"I am a book addict, but I have long had a list of the top five books that would never be away from my possession and this one tops the list. I buy every used copy I find so I can give it away without letting go of my copy. It is intense, sweet, emotional and gritty. It makes me cry and laugh and remember to live every moment i the realization that life is a fragile gift. It may not be the best book for everyone, but it speaks straight to my heart and is the best book I have ever read for reminding me that life is precious. Thank you for having written a book that has changed my view and my daily life."
1,You have got to be kidding,"When I saw this for sale, I laughed out loud (and didn't even think about buying it). I can't believe they proudly announce on the cover that it's 'based on the computer game from SSI.' If you have any idea as to how insanely plotless and lame that game is, you'll know to stay away from anything based on it. The entire game is a big 'kick in the door' dungeon crawl, uninspired and utterly boring. The main strength of pen and paper D&D is the story, and there is no story in POR: ROMD. Save your money and get a better adventure, or make one up on your own."
4,Good Overview but not a How To Book or Consumer Reports,"I reviewed another book where another reviewer complained that it was a ""coffee table"" book. This is much the same, an overview of all types of 4X4s with lots of nice pictures and info expecially about what's available in Europe. I think that it is great for someone thinking about buying an all wheel drive, but I'm sure some people will be disappointed. It brings up the questions you need to ask yourself before you buy. Some will find the questions obvious and the answers weak, but it is a good place to start. It's not as strong as a Consumer Reports as far as rating each vechile, but it covers a lot of ground. With all the talk here about better fuel economy, some of the small European models could show up here in the US (but don't hold your breath)."
3,It's OK but...,"I ordered this because I was sick of the IPAQ sitting on my desk taking up space and thought this would solve the problem. It did. The only issue is that the cradle is kind of loose with the normal battery and won't handle the extended battery.Overall, it does what I was hoping it would do but I was disappointed that it wouldn't handle the extended battery."

5,A Poignant Portrayal of the Mother Daughter Relationship,"Jeannie Dubose's book, The Mother Daughter Dance, is a stirring, beautiful rendering of the complex dynamic between a mother and daughter. Dubose skillfully portrays the characters in the ""dance""--the mother and daughter-- with authenticity and dimension. The text is autobiographical but, at the same time, universal in its themes. Dubose's beautiful artwork grips and holds the reader. This marvelous book has grit and complexity. Bravo!"
1,What a nothing book!,"I read fantastic reviews on Amazon for this book -- and so bought a copy for each of my daughters. Big mistake!! They found it laughable in all of its ""wisdom"" -- I felt like a sucker!"
3,"Works great, but...","works great , very versatile, but Brinkmann doesn't support it or have replacement parts. If it's outside during the winter, it'll rust and need repainting each summer. The grill racks eventually wear out, I assume home depot may have something. Hard to clean out the ash."
5,Best BBQ I have owned,I got my pit back in '92 and I have not been kind to this unit at all but it has NEVER let me down. I am finally ready for a new one and will purchase the SNP once again only this tme I will get the cover to keep the Louisiana rain away from it. I BBQ year round and love the results I get with my pit.heat control seem simple for me I leave the smoke stack open full and the air vent open only a sliver and the heat stays around 200-220. I would say invest in a charcoal starter for adding coals and wood in the middle of a BBQ session that way you do not get lighter fluid taste on you meat the person trying to do steaks and pork chops I sugest ya grill those in the fire boxand bbq your larger cuts of meat. ALL and ALL this was a GREAT purchase and you will not be sad ya spent the bucks for this one :o)
2,Needs some work.,"This movie is based on a true story, though it also contains many factual inaccuracies. In addition, there are some serious technical problems. For example, in at least three scenes the microphone boom can be seen at the top of the screen. The film is supposed to be filmed in Nebraska and Wyoming, but appears to have been filmed somewhere in the southwest. The scenery is all wrong. The acting is weak and the script thin. Clearly, the budget was too low to do it right!What Charlie Starkweather and his girlfriend did makes a facinating story, but I was very disappointed by this attempt to tell that story. So much more could have been done with better research, better writing, better acting, better props, and better editing."
1,The worst...,"This is a horrific testament to poor filmmaking; the script is a mere collection of murder mystery/romance film cliches. The acting is ""community theatre"", at best... and as a historical film, it fails miserably. If there were ever a reason Hollywood should not recreate history, this would be it. Avoid it at all costs."
4,opinion,"a good movie to watch but there is a slight inacurate in the story, but all in all,a must see"
4,I liked this movie,"I thought that this movie was very well done and for a low budget movie it was excellent. It was a part of history that in my opinion, needed to be told. I did look him up on the net, and the information was pretty accurate to the movie of what happened. I also thought it was presented well as Starkweather was an abused child by his own ""voices"" that he was hearing. If you are a ""serial killer"" movie fan, than this one is a definite one to watch."
2,Not Bad but Not Too Great.....,"I was somewhat disappointed with this movie. Being a true story, I was curious, especially since this movie is about a serial killer. With quotes like..... Before Dahmer, Before Bundy, he was the most feared, I really wanted to see this movie even though I am not familiar with the name Charles Starkweather. Turns out he and his young girlfriend went on a murdering spree in Nebraska and Wyoming. It is said that they killed 11 people. It is also said that this movie inspired Natural Born Killers and Kalifornia. It was just OK for me. The acting wasn't bad. Brent Taylor gave a good performance as the deranged Starkweather and Shannon Lucio gave a good performance as the equally deranged girlfriend, Caril Ann. This is a movie just worth renting, not worth buying."
5,A Must Have...,"Okay, I'll admit it. I've been a Duran fan for 19+ years and have every CD, LP, cassette, etc. with their name on it. But this was a long-time-coming CD that should have been released by EMI many years ago. The ""new"" versions of Planet Earth and Hold Back the Rain are worth the price alone! If you love Duran like I do, this would be a great addition for your collection (sounds really good in the car, too)."
4,"Very pretty, shimmery BLUE!","I just want to start my post by stating that I love OPI products. They consistently produce a quality nail product in a variety of gorgeous colors. I would describe this color as an eggshell, light BLUE. It's definitely not a gray color. If you're looking for a gray, you might try ""French Quarter for Your Thoughts"" by OPI, which is a flat medium gray color. In my opinion, it's very hard to find the right color gray. It's always more blue, purple, or green than grey, but I think the French Quarter color is pretty on with the gray color.I love:1. The quality of OPI products2. Beautiful, eggshell light blue colorI wish:1. It didn't chip so easily (I do the whole thing with a good base and top coat, but it still chips.)"
3,Very thin.,"This polish is gorgeous in the bottle, but the application is extremely thin. It took 3 coats to make is look somewhat normal, but it took forever to dry."
5,Great purchase!,Colors are exactly as described and shipping was very prompt! Very happy with this purchase. Too Hot Pink to Hold'Em is a great summer color - hot pink with the slightest hint of peach. Great beach pedicure!
1,meh,"i love this color but the one i recieve was in very bad condition. ive never had a nail polish that was so watery, i can't even use it. i do reccommend this color but not from this site, just buy it at a store."
5,Glossy Goodness!,"Awesome sparkly polish! OPi does jelly really well! This color isn't as HOT pink as I'd hoped, but it's so glossy, sparkly and so saturated in jolly rancher goodness!I have all the sorbets except Texy. It's impossible to have a favorite. Fantastic formulas all around; apply like a dream."
3,San Tan-Tonio,I wanted this type of color for my toes as I wanted to keep it as neutral as possible without having to worry about updating my color or changing it given the outfit.Good deal.
2,"Too watery... Not really a fan of ""sorbet-like"" shades by OPI","I'm just flat out disappointed in this color... I always apply nail strengthener and base coat to prime my nails, and I still had to pain 4 coats before I achieved solid color. I really do hate sheer nail polish...I realize it's a new formula for ""sorbet-like"" shades, but I didn't like the way it looked. I may need to paint a pale, opaque shade on my nails first and give it a second try."
2,Not the right color!,"The product shown in the picture is a completely different color as the actual product. OPI is a great brand and the product works great, it's just the wrong color! I expected a reddish pink and this is more of a coral color!"
5,Un Grito A La esperanza/A Shout For Hope,"Que podemos decir de ""Marinero De Luces"" que pocos no sepan. Esta grabacion fue un grito a la esperanza,un llanto,una vida,un coraje, tambien es ternura y dolor y intento a sonreir. Fue la vuelta a este mundo de Isabel Pantoja, y lo hizo como nadie,como lo que es ""Una Senora"". Pero ojo, esto no fue el debut de Isabel Pantoja ni mucho menos, Isabel ya era ""Isabel pantoja"" muchos anos antes.Este es un disco para cuidarlo con carino para cualquier fan de Isabel.//What can I say about ""Marinero De Luces"", that not many wouldn't know. It's a shout for peace, it's a cry in itself, it's a whole life full of tenderness together with bitterness. It was the come back to this world of Isabel pantoja, & she did like no one else knew..""Like A Lady"". But remember this was not her debut, she was Isabel Pantoja years before this recording, this was just her comeback. This is a recording to treasure in every Isabel pantoja's fan collection."

2,brilliantly written pointlessness,"Another reviewer said to read this in the winter, so I did. The rain and drizzle trapped me indoors so Naipaul had a captive audience. I didn't relish the book or the characters, nor did I think the attention to detail to be much of an inspiration. I was kind of amused with some of the ideas, and kept thinking there was a bigger, sublime hidden message that would eventually jump out at me. Finally in the last few pages he tells us what motivated him to write this book, but even then the purpose sort of lost me. His attention to explaining simple things in elaborate detail show that he's an accompished writer, so I find it quixotic that so much energy went into a book with such a flat, unemotional, nearly pointless ramble of words."
1,Attention to Detail - VERY BORING,"I just finished reading Miguel Street by V.S. Naipaul when I went to a nearby used book store and picked out this book - thinking they would be similar - WRONG! This book pays so much attention to detail - to every person, blade of grass, plastic bag, dead cow, etc. that is takes forever to even get into the plot of the book - when does the interesting stuff happen? The first half of the book could be condensed into 20 pages - no problem - I understand his need to give an account of the surroundings upon his arrival - but COME ON! It is way too much - to be honest with you - I gave up reading it because it became pure torture - and I feel like it is not worth the $5 I spent on it. Disappointing. But - if you get a chance - Miguel Street is a great book."
1,Barbarian set to rate?,"I truly feel the part of the Philistine in writing this review.I bought the book to increase my culture.I bought the book in appreciation of a Nobel Laureate.I bought the book because I felt I shouldNone of these reasons were good enough reasons for me to spend time reading it.The book is painfully slow, and difficult to read. The plot is nearly non-existant, but that can be overcome. The author's point was elusive, making me wonder why I read this. I've known root canals to be less painful.If you are into Naipul, this may be the book for you.If you're looking to get into ""The Great Books"", start with another.Maybe I'll try again in a few years."
2,Don't buy the game,"I think this is a very boring game. The deer are always at the same place,so you know where the deer are. I have finished all of the hunts on the game in about a half hour. If you want to buy a good hunting game buy Cabela's Big Game Hunter 6."
2,Not very useful,"I bought this book with the hopes of having a reference that would limit my hours of google research and talking to other designers to try to find answers to common design issues. But for some reason, it seems to have all the information I'm not looking for, and none of the information I'm actually looking for! Buy Time Saver Standards instead. It's heavier and more expensive, but much more complete."
4,Condensed but slightly diluted version if times savers standards,"This is a great pocket sized guide to landscape arch standards. Some information is a little vague, but that will happen when you reduce a 1000+ page manual (times savers) into a 100+ page guidebook."
5,Makes kids see if they can make animals,This is a very good book for kids aged 5 to 10. It encourages kids to try and make some of the fruit or vegetable animals they see in the book. I made a banana octopus. It is also good for schools to do crafts.Thanks to the author for making this book's characters out of fruits and vegetables. It's so interesting.
5,My son's favorite!,"My 15 month old son by far prefers this book over ALL of the books I have introduced to him. It's so funny, everytime I put the book near him he grabs it and can't wait to see the banana's.(Banana's are his favorite fruit!)Good book for little one's and well as the older one's!"
3,Unabashedly downbeat.,"Sam Birge, the very same homicide detective featured in Krasner's much earlier novel, Walk the Dark Streets, is again called upon to investigate a perplexing killing. This time the victim is 21 year old Wes Gowen, a would be writer and poet whose lifeless body is found in the hallway of a downscale apartment building.As Birge and his partner, Charley Hagen, question the building's tenants as well as the denizens of a Bohemian style restaurant housed on the ground floor of the premises, a troubling web of dysfunctional interpersonal relationships emerges. Just as in Walk the Dark Streets, the voice of the victim is resurrected through the discovery of a revealing journal which proves invaluable in piecing together the circumstances under which the crime took place.Death of a Minor Poet is a serious novel that explores the consequences of poverty, dysfunctional families and youthful mistakes. A sad, sobering, cogent read."
5,A must-have for anyone who wears make-up!,I mix a bit of this in with my foundation to get just the right shade/tone for my skin type - not just for under my eyes! It blends well. Great product!
3,Unisex watch for women or kids,"Even though Timex advertised this as mid size, the watch dial is small and meant to be for kids and women, or any one with a small wrist. Timex is not consistent with their advertised 'size' among different styles of watches.The watch does looks great and stylish. The light blue color will be more dull in real life. Like the previous reviewer, I believe the dial and band are too small for adult men. I think anyone with a write wider than 1 1/2 inch is is too big for this watch.I wanted to keep it but wearing made it looked like I am an adult wearing a kids watch. So I returned it."
5,Purchase,"This watch purchased for a Police Woman, she loves it, it has all the functions she needs and wants, I like it for the value (price). I also am pleased how easy it is to buy on amazon......"
3,The quality I anticipated,"This rating is a 'neutral' rating. I got what I anticipated and therefore can't complain. I liked the review/writeup. I was desperate for something fairly mindless to watch and this fit the bill. While I am not hispanic, I occasionally find an 'indie gem' worth watching among the numerous movies Mexico and South America produces.This turned out not to be one of those gems! I took a chance, rolled the dice and came up 'craps'.To be fair, as I said above, I got what I anticipated but I had hoped for better.I'm not going to rehash the plot or give spoilers. The movie isn't worth describing. Read the other reviews. This is strictly an opinion review. I watched it, didn't like it and won't watch it again.End of Story."
3,Cabinda in todays headlines,A good mystery set in today's (Jan 2010) most obscure place...lots of local colour. Dated perhaps but time does not move fast in Cabinda.
5,these things are great!,"replaced (upgraded) factory OEM speakers in the rear doors with these things and they give a punch!. I have an amp/equalizer. but I definitely like them. The 4"" diameter is measured at the little mounting ""ears"" or tabs and not at the speaker cone. Make sure that's what you want."
1,WARNING WARNING PURE JUNK!,"I bought 2 sets of 4 ohms versions speakers Thinking that the postive reviews where right (More Postive then negative) And boy was I wrong. Lets start off I had them hooked up to a INFINITY REFERENCE 475A amp that produces 75 watts RMS X 4, The amp was half way up, I would say 37.5 watts RMS X 4, Three days latter 1 was toast, In the next 2 days one kept losing the tweeter, I took the door apart to find the tweeter came unscrewed, I went to screw it back in after peeling the sticker off the back of the speaker to find the screw, It was stripped out then I had a problem with the back one 2 weeks latter it only worked when It wantted to I soitered wires to the terminals, So I knew that was not a problem, Now I had 1 speaker working, But removed it to start over, They sounded Like they cost CHEAP, Ive been doing this for 14+ Years in many cars and trucks And tried to go cheap and got burned! Do your self a favor and spend a little more now to save you latter."
5,great for the $,I installed these in a 1999 silverado that has the original head to replace the original speakers. For what i paid you can not beat it. They are much better than the worn out speakers i had.
5,Awesome,I purchased 2 pairs of these to replace the stock speakers in my car and they sound great! Very good quality for a really low price. I would definitely recommend them!
4,Good speaker if your on a budget.,"I put these little speakers in my new audio setup. Definitely better than the paper cones that came stock but don't expect to win any DB/SPL competitions with your friends. They provide clean sound as what most poeple would consider ""comfortable listening levels."" Some distortion in more full ranged songs, great for everyday use most bang on a budget!"
2,Alright.,"I bought these because my stock ones gave out, they are good but if you turn them up to much its major distortion, i sold them right away i regret loosing my money."
2,Didnt fit 2000 prelude,Speakers didnt fit in my 2000 honda prelude door at all. =( they are good speakers... i heard them play.. they just dont fit.!! =(They are like a few milimeters bigger than my stock speakers.Again.. these are great speakers!If you know of a way to install these speakers on my prelude.. please let me know.
2,Decent low priced speaker. Some problems though.,The wire from the woofer to the tweeter broke after about 1 day of playing music. It's connected to the head unit and not through any amp's so it's not like I overpowered it. The wire seems stiff / brittle so that's maybe why it broke. I fixed it by rewiring it with my own wire and solder It's been fine since then.Other than that problem. It's a average speaker. Fits the front with some minor modification in a 92 GMC Jimmmy.
5,The best,"This r the best speakers that gives u sound and quality for a cheap price, i have 10 6.5 , and 4,6x9 and they give me what i ask for !!!! Very happy"
1,Worst Speakers ever (P.O.S.),If I could give zero stars I would these speakers work for about 3 day before the first one blew a couple days later the other one blew and before that they where really low i could barely hear them not worth the money P.O.S.
1,NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 300W!!!!,"I hooked these up to an MTX TC2002, it's rated at 50x2 rms at 4 ohms, or 100x2 peak, granted the charge sheet that came with the amp showed it tested a little higher, but within 5 minutes of hooking these speakers up they were toast. RIDICULOUS!!!! These things say they are 300W peak each and they are not even close. Also looks like a generic speaker with a Boss Audio sticker slapped on, but thats probably why they are 22 bucks.... I'd return them but it's not worth the gas to the post office and the shipping charges..."
1,Great Sound...While They Last,I have installed 4 of these in my truck. They sound awesome... The problem is that 3 of them have crapped out. Same issue for all 3. If you turn it up too much (which isn't that loud really) the connection for the wire passing through the cone gets loose. If you wiggle it it works sometimes. Trying to solder it is difficult. If you don't do it just right you can melt a hole through the cone. Even though the price is great they are not worth the headache. Invest in some from a brand you can trust.
1,Don't bother with these at all BAD! WARRANTY,"I purchased 2 sets of these, sounded decent until 1 started crackling 3 months after installation. I called warranty service from BOSS and they want you to send in the bad speaker along with a $30.00 money order to cover shipping back to you, plus you are responsible for shipping to them. Needless to say I had a few choice expletives for him. If you buy these just remember after 30 days you are on your own or it's actually cheaper just to buy a new set. CHINESE JUNK! Shame on me should have known better."
1,Bad quality,"I chose this rating because i bought them, and 2 days later the speaker blew, i paid good money for these and i demand a new pair for free. They were great when i first installed them, then the speaker started rattling and sounding like torn paper. I deman a New set at once. please and thank you."
1,big mistake.,dont buy them they are junk worst speakers ever made build quality is really bad i wouldnt buy them again.
4,Boss CH6520 Chaos Series,"Great speakers for the price. Shipped very quickly and received in good shape. Just what I wanted, fit nicely in the area look great."
1,Definitely NOT worth it,"I was able to get a new head unit recently that came with decent rear speakers, so I bought these for the front of the car. I installed these speakers looking for a moderate improvement in my 1996 Toyota Corolla. Boy was I wrong. These speakers didn't even sound the same, they sounded WORSE. They were tinny and didn't emit any volume at all. I installed the right side first and compared both stock and these BOSS speakers by changing the balance on my stereo. I am no audiophile by any means, but this set of speakers were inferior to stock speakers from 15+ years ago! I returned these as soon as I could and reinstalled the stock speakers. Next time i won't let the price tempt me and invest a little more money for a set of decent speakers."
4,good but not the best,reallg good speakers I see a lpt of bad reviews and idk what there talking about. For the price the great . The bass isn't the best but it gets the job done . Its deffenitly an upgrade from stock I. The one con has to be its quietness... Its not toooo bad but there not as loud as you may think they would be..
2,IDK,"Pretty cheap, I didn't expect too much. People said these speakers are really quite but I ordered these and hooked up with amp for power. Still its quiet."
3,uhh,work. not for a sienna . but if you know what you doing you can get it to work. get speaker that fit do not sound the same
1,DONT EVER BUY THESE SPEAKERS,THESE BAD QUALITY SPEAKERS. THEY LOOK GOOD BUT HAS NO POWER EVEN IF YOU HOOK THEM UP TO AN AMP.
2,"Cheaply made, u get what u paid for","They distort with little volume, by ear judgement they are more like 20W rms and prbably 100W peak, the 200W they state is probably just at the point they burn, but we'll... For the little money u pay, they're ok, and u go from papercone to polypropelene"
2,Worked well when they did.....,Sorry to say that they didn't work very long...1 speaker started crackling & then didn't work at all...not a very good value even at this price :(
1,junk,"these are junk worked a few days and started to sound like crap . factory radio so there wasnt to much wattage or anything other than junk speakers.,"
4,Pretty good not perfect,Replaced my factory installed speakers in my 2002 Chevy cavalier and am happy about them. only reason they dont get the 5 star is sometimes when there is a lot of bass i hear a hissing sound coming out of them. if you want a speaker to replace your factory installed speaker and dont want to spend lots of money then get these.
5,Quality + Good Price,"i bought these for my mitsubishi montero sport, replaced the factory radio with Pioneer and these speakers.. AWESOME...money well spent, they sound great, good base, and clear sound..Definitely recommend to other people"
1,Get what you pay for,"They sounded great for about 1 month...then first the one I put in the passenger side began to sound fuzzy and crackly, then about 3 weeks later the driverside followed. Did not blast them loud either. You get what you pay for."
3,Great SOUND TERRIBLE LIFE SPAN,"I bought these speakers about 6 months ago and they sounded amazing. Crystal clear sound, however they can't handle bass at all. It makes a funny popcorn sound which goes away and comes back. I'm removing these speakers and putting in JBL GTO938 6-Inch x 9-Inch 3-Way Loudspeaker. The new speakers I purchased have the speaker of the year award so fyi if you want great speakers put up the extra cash and save yourself a headache with boss."
1,don't get your hopes up,ok product. not what i expected. right speaker is already wanting to give up. just a replacement speaker so don't expect to be blasting your music without causing the speaker harm
4,nice speakers,"I bought these speakers to replace busted rear speakers in Acura Integra. Installation was somewhat difficult since the original speakers were 1/4 inch smaller in diameter. After installing I could compare them to front speakers which are ten times more expensive Infinity Reference components (same size). These Boss speakers sound amazingly well. Highs are clear. Bass is decent. Compared to Infinity speakers the sound lacks some definition, but that should not be surprising. I think these speakers are perfect solution for rear speakers which are not critical in a system, and these will not degrade the sound of front speakers. For many people these may also be a good choice overall (both front and rear speakers) since they sound better than most factory speakers. I am considering putting them as both front and rear speakers in my other car."
4,Nice speakers for the money,"To be honest this is the first set of Boss speaker's I have purchased, but for the money, Boss has delivered a solid speaker. Many people talk down on Boss because it's a budget brand product, but remember, if they were not at least decent, they couldn't have stuck around this long. Have heard many Boss stereo setups in the past and was impressed with the quality of sound for the money paid, and I am very pleased with these speakers. Sure there are better ones out there, but for less than $20, these can't be beat. If your on a budget and want to improve the sound of your audio system, I would recommend giving these a try. High frequencies are very crisp, mids are certainly there, and of course the lows aren't of sub-bass quality, but for a 6.5"" speaker, these do have a little kick to them."
3,commercial invoice,"good morning, and the product arrived at my locker, but I have been able to send to my country because they lack the commercial invoice, as I do?"
3,Good price,"These speakers were great for what I was looking for, which was OEM replacement. Wouldn't recommend them for someone who is looking for superior sound quality, but for the price I paid these were the best speakers out there."
3,Not what I expected.,"I didn't think they sounded any better than my stock 4"" speaker pair. They have no bass at all, but then again I didn't expect them too. They're pretty nice speakers all in all, but I'm going to return them and save to invest in some nicer speakers. I wouldn't recommend them, but if you want to try them for yourself, I'm not holding you back. Your system might be what the speaker needs to run satisfactory. 3 stars for looking good, and probably sounding good if I felt like having to get a lot more power to them than what I have."
4,Good Speakers...,"I was expecting a little more bass, not that they lack, but you get what you pay for when it comes to the bass. However, having 4 tweeters really opens up the music spectrum and releases all the instrumental you need. Paired with a nice set of 6.5"" Component Speakers that more than make up for the bass, these things are awesome! GREAT COMBINATION! I have yet to wire these to an amp, so the bass may get better with an amplifier..."
2,not to loud,the boss speaker doesn't exceed high volume they will rattle if you go pass 180 amps and i think they were rated at 350amps and the recoil also dosen't bring all the sound out clear.might work better in small cars not suv or vans.
2,Not better than stock,"I purchased these speakers as a replacement in my F150 prior to trading it in. I removed Infiniti components and once these Boss speakers were installed, you could tell the difference. Even stock speakers sound better and have better mids and lows, but these have better highs. At a louder volume, these speakers give in and pop and sound very distorted. If you are looking for an upgrade over stock, this isn't it."
2,Buy Something Else,"I Bought two pairs of these in nov 2011, by the same time next year only one still works. Don't be cheap. Just spend the little extra on a name brand and don't buy these!!!"
5,Nice speakers,"Put these in the door of my SUV. Added a lot of sound that I didn't know I was missing. If you pair these with some tweeters, you get a well balanced sound. Especially with a 10"" or 12"" sub. Clean sound and good price."
4,Nice speakers!,i have tehes amplified with a 4 channel 400 watts ! tehy soundgreat! maybe the bass not so well but still it is a preetty good stuff!
4,Boss Is a Good Brand Name,I Chose 4 Stars because the sound is unbelievable. I Like this product. I Would recommend this product to any lookin for a smooth Factory Sound.
1,boss ch6520 chaos series 6.5 2 way speakers,"very disapointed,i put these in the back doors of my 2001 s10 blazer,the factory speakers are still up front but they are rattling, but they being busted sound better than the new boss speakers,i bought four but i will not install the other two.note iam running a factory stereo with no amp, everything is factory,these speakers remind me of the sparkostatic speakers from back in the day."
3,Good sound but not enough,"The speakers have good sound at low volumegive good bass and treble, but when the volume increases,begin to vibrate and reduces quality, soWhat can you expect from a cheap speaker?money wasted"
1,warning about assembled product,"product inspection must not exist in china, 1st pair had unsoldered joints on one speaker, return and received 2nd pair; same problem with one speaker, combining the two shipments provided two working speakers. You get what you pay for in quality, poor assembly and bare bones. Amazon returns was fair but who repays your time removing and installing. Buy American comes to mind."
2,they work thats about it,THEY WORK.MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT ORDERING FROMAMAZON BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT LET YOU CANCEL ORDER NO MATTER HOW FAST YOUREQUEST CANCELATION!
4,Good Sound,"I found these speakers to have very good, clear sound. They really improved the sound system in my pickup truck that only had room for 4"" speakers. I consider them a good value for the price.Travis"
4,Decent price for quality,For the price these 3-ways are not a bad deal. I'm happy with them. I expected a little more bass though out of them
4,better than paper speakers,bought these for my complete system overhaul in my 99 suburban fit the front doors perfectly cleaner sound than stock. Im running them off a 100 watt amp they handle the power well but i wouldnt go much higher. for a two way speaker the bass is pretty good the mid and high are great. overall if your replacing door speakers these are good for the price.
2,they are ok,I put these in my truck because I'm on a budget. They are slightly better than the stock speakers. I won't buy them again.
4,Not bad for the price,"I bought these speakers for an old 92 Acura Integra. Amazon fitment utility told me this item would fit this car and it didn't. The speakers are a little too big for the factory location in the car. Some modifying will have to be done or just use one screw to lock it in place. If you are making an audio PVC audio pipe with 6"" PVC these speakers should work for your application. Everyone says the speakers sound a little quiet compared to the ones being replaced. I would agree with this observation. I am not unhappy with these speakers because it solved the problem I was trying to address in the car and I have sound back for very little money. I would have given these speakers 5 stars if it would have fit in the car's speaker locations."
4,Great for the price,I bought these for a speaker upgrade to a Chevy HHR & am very happy with the sound of them in combo with the original stereo. My only complaint would be that the gauge of the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is too thin otherwise I'd have given 5 stars.
3,just ok,Price is good. sound is not the best cant turn it up louder than an indoor voice or they start making a crackling sound.
4,They look GOOD,"I would say these are well worth the money and you can definitely hear a difference from the stock cone paper speakers your car came with! But, when I got the package I was unhappy to find that BOTH of the dust covers were cracked )= I was planning on using them but i guess not anymore. They sound good but can't handle too much base. But hey, what are subs for? I say these are GREAT for the price! Plus they look good."
4,It is what it isnt,"After reading other reviews before I purchased, I wasn't surprised.The mounting rings were bent- all four.No big deal though.I slammed them on my bench a couple of timesAnd WALA . Install was a snap, after I cut the too small conductorAnd used factory wiring with new terminals from radio crap.Those speakers sound great with factory head unit, both of whichAre in the trash."
2,Junk,Blown after 3 weeks. There has always been distortion at any volume level that is audible in the front seats.Don't waste your money.
2,Junk,"I bought these speakers as a cheap replacement for blown factory speakers. I wasn't expecting amazing sound, just decent. Within 2 days the speakers began to cut out occasionally. After ripping my door apart to see why, I found that the speaker lead terminals were so loosely riveted to the basket that every bump in the road would cause them to cut out.I'm not wasting my time with these anymore, but to anyone who buys them, solder the terminals to the basket before installing them into your vehicle."
3,Boss Speaker Review,The speakers are average at best their output will peak before you are done turning your radio up. I don't really know that adding an amp would improve the quality of sound. The price is the only reason I purchased the speakers. I also purchased the Boss 6 x 9 5 way and have the same felling about them.Still looking for a better yet affordable ways than the Boss brand.
4,"Great Sound, Great Price","These speakers were an easy install in my Dodge Caliber. They sound fantastic. Some reviews have noted a lack of bass. Mind you, I am not one of those people who loosen tooth fillings with bass, but i found it acceptable when I used the ""loud"" setting and ""Rock"" EQ setting on my Jensen stereo."
2,Boss CH5720 Speakers,"These speakers are nothing special. I needed to replace factory originals on my old car. The tweeters are an upgrade, the bass may not be quite as good as the factory originals. I didn't want to spend a lot to have speakers that worked in my old car and that's about it. If I were trying to upgrade in a newer car, these would not be the speaker of choice. For what I wanted to accomplish they are adequate. that's about it."
3,Boss 6X9,If you want to replace your factory speakers these are ok.but if you wants them for a system these are not for you.they cant handle 150 watts rms like they claim.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I installed these speakers 2 weeks ago in the dash of my car, hoping that I had found a quality speaker for a good price. The first time I listened to them, I thought I had, because they sounded great. A couple of days later, I noticed some vibration coming from the dash, as if the speakers were blown. I thought it might just be something loose in the dash, so I took the speakers out of the dash and listened to them while holding them in my hand. The speakers would vibrate any time there was bass being pumped through, and it is not worth it to send them back as shipping costs just as much as new speakers. So now I'm doing what I should have done in the first place: buying good quality speakers."
1,speakers are useless waste of money,buy these speakers because I saw the other reviews and saw some bad But I also saw good so we decided that the price was gonna give them a chance but they are a crap .. when increasing the volume of my stereo start to distort.
3,Pretty good but there are better out there for the money.,"I bought this pair because I was looking for a really cheap pair of 2 way speakers. These did the trick. With lots of power handling and a nice rubber surround and poly cone I figured all would be well. It was until I heard the lows. These don't produce very good bass at all. They sound much better than the stock speakers as far as mids and highs but bass... no. 100hz is way too high for me.There are many other sets of 2 way 6.5"" speakers out there that can deliver much lower bass than this for under $30.Check out Lanzar speakers on ebay. They go very low and they're about the same price."
4,Great speakers with poor soldering.,This is the first time ive ever bought boss audio products and for the price you cant really beat them. If I had to rate them id say they are better then sonys and almost as good as pioneer but no where close too infinity. The soldering job was kinda bad on my speakers...Im sure not all of them are like this but I did go ahead and re-solder a couple of the connections. These speakers suck tons of power and if you hook them up too a head unit it starts too distort fairly quickly. If you buy these speakers make sure you buy an amp to go along with them cuz@ 22rms per speaker the head unit is way underpowering them. I have an amp on its way I cant wait too hook em up and see what they will really do.
4,Pretty Solid Speakers,"Very nice, crisp sounding speakers. High's are nice and clear, mids are solid, Bass is solid as well. Only issue I had was the mounting holes for my Civic doesn't have the correct bolt pattern, but I made it fit.Needs instruction manual."
4,Good Speakers,"I put these in my 98 Civic Hatchback and they fit perfect, they sound much better than the original ones that were old and trashed. You get what you pay for, but they do the job just fine."
4,Great sound real improvement for my system.,Only problem with this is the packaging is unable to protect speakers. Ordered three sets so far and had four broken grills and two broken speakers. Make sure you check them as soon as you get them so not like me and can't send them back after 30 day because you waited for nicer weather to install them. Still was a nice christmas gift.
2,One Good One Bad,I bought these speakers and installed them just to find one of them is inoperative. When i contacted the seller with my order number they said they couldnt find my order.... it was just a few days ago i doubt u sell that many of these. anyway they want me to call so 1800 number ummm no thanks. if i was any of you buyers out there yes the one sounded pretty good but go ahead and spend the 20 bucks more and get some pioneers or kickers or better named brand.
5,"Great little speakers, and they were only $15 bucks!!!","These things sound great, and wasn't a hassle to install. If you want an upgrade from basic, then these are the way to go. They have your bass, mid, and a tweeter, so you will get plenty of sound for the price. You can't beat them! If they are/go bad however, its not so bad due to the price."
2,ITS BROKE,i order these speakers a week ago n just got them and one of the grills was bro and so was the opposite speaker. im very disappointed and have to pay 15 dollars to send them back so ima c if i can super glue if not ima send it back
4,Boss FTW,"Pretty much for such a cheap price you cant go wrong. The sound is crisp and clean, cones are durable polycarbonate and they look good. I replaced the stock 4 x 6s in my 2000 Grand Am (which by the way sounded fantastic, just the cones were old and cracking.)with these and they definately did the trick. The low tones are clear (although not very deep) and the mid and high range sounds fantastic. If your just trying to improve an already good system or making a good system from scratch I would definately run these. I have 2 Boss 4 x 6's 2 Boss 800w 6 x 9's and a boss 400w Amp and Shallow Mount sub. The entire system sounds absolutely incredible with deeep low tones and incredibly clear mid and high range. The system costed under $150.00 to put together and it sounds better than most top dollar equipment people generally buy. If you use the right enclosures and mount the boxes in the right place you dont need thousands of watts of power to get a good boom."
3,speakers,"not bad for little speakers,price was all right. sound pretty good. i think i would buy boss again if the need arose"
3,you get wat you pay for,"i connected this speakers to my 1000 watt 4ch kenwood amp and one of them blew out the same day....very disappointing, at least one still works...."
2,Average,"I have a 20 year old car, original audio system and a 'blown' speaker. I purchased these and replaced the 'blown' one with the new one. Turning on the head unit gave no appreciable difference between the worn out 20 year old factory unit and the brand new Boss unit. Needless to say that I was hoping for better. So, if you are looking for an inexpensive way to replace a defective speaker in your car then look no further. But, if your looking for an 'upgrade' then I'd advise you to save your $$ and buy something else."
3,decent for the money,"these speakers are ok i do somewhat regret buying them they pick up the lows very well and hit pretty hardbut they seriously lack mid and high end i think the model ch6950 is much better seeing that it has 2 - "" POLYIMIDE CONE tweeters and 1"" POLYIMIDE DOME / 2 x "" PIEZO tweeters and this model ch6920 only has 1 1"" polyimide tweet but i guess for $22.38 they sound pretty good they are however not better then the factory bose audio they replaced in my cadillac"
2,Boss speakers,"Real short and sweet... You get what you pay for. I ended up returning because not satisfied with performance but hey, want a cheap pair of speakers? Buy these."
2,Not suitable for Nissan Xterra 2006,"I got these speakers yestearday. Before placing order, I checked this item were suitable for my Nissan Xterra 2006 in the box named ""MAKE SURE IT FITS"" and it said the speakers fits in my car....BUT IT'S NOT TRUTH.After remove the original speaker I realized the Boss CH6950 have a longer measure from the front to the magnet on the back. This cause that the speaker cannot fit in my car. What a waste of time and money....!!!"
1,Good night still has not come package,"Good night still has not come package, Good night still has not come the package, just need to know if information was sent by UPS or which mandates"
1,"One died, Other one Weak","Weak. Bought to replace stocks for 97 grand am. First speaker died after a week,the second works,though scratchy when playing.And frankly, werent really much better than 15 yr old paper stock speakers. They look cool...In the Trash. Dont waste your time, buy some Alpines."
1,Please heed my warning,I didn't buy these Boss Chaos door speakers on Amazon I got them at walmart and spent $25.00 on them and they are not even worth that much they are horrible. I can't hardly hear the music unless I crank up the sound and even then its sub-par I had my suspicions when I placed the order and they proved right as soon as I put them in and turned on my car !! Save your money and buy quality Kickers or Pioneers they will save you the trouble of having to take them out and put in better speakers. What a joke.
5,there loud,i love this product when i got them i hook it up to my expedition and they are loud i didnt think they was going to sound like this and the bass is good too and it was easy to install
3,Good replacment spreaker,"Brought to replace stock spreakers, they are o.k. Good for price, they will not blow you out of the water but they improve your listen quailty."
2,...,they did not sound anything like i expected my old speakers sounded way better if i had it to do over i would not buy them again
3,there ok,"Bought these to go replace the stock rear speakers and they sounded ok but if i gave them bass it would distort right away. i was giving it 50 rms at 4 ohms, so there def overrated.. I recommend spending about 20 dollers more for alpine 6.5 inch components or kenwoods. iv heard notthign ubt bad things bout boss"
1,Sound quality is good but terribly engineered. Did not last a month!! DO NOT BUY!,"These were replacements stock speakers on my old SAAB, they sounded great while they worked but, everything on it came loose and started rattling and all in a matter of a month and a few days. I understand the low price but given how long they last, they end up being extremely expensive for what they are!!! DO NOT BUY!"
5,a life line,This book was a lifeline for me during my daughter's first 6 months. It was validating and only took minutes to read a day. I have purchased a copy for a good friend who is expecting and will do so for as many expectant mothers as I can.
5,they're not kidding !,When the call it Peaches and Pecan. It's loaded with fruit and nuts. usually with granola you have to search to find the odd piece of fruit or nuts. You get somting in every bite. Roasted to perfection...I'm addicted
3,OK for a new born,"It looked so much cuter in photos then on the child - very thin material, easy to put on a new born but if ur child is 8 months old buy him for a 2 year old cause it is pretty tight."
