3,case good - belt clip bad,"The case is really nice. It fits perfectly, is easy to put on, and allows free use of the buttons. The only thing about the case that could be better is if it had a screen protector.the belt clip is really cheap and cheesy. I would not trust it.I will be using this case while my Sansa is plugged into my auxiliary jack in my car so I won't need the belt clip. For workouts, I have the Griffin armband which has a screen cover. The Griffin doesn't fit nearly as nicely as this case, but it has a very sturdy arm band which is an absolute must when I'm running."
4,Best silicone protector I've seen,The protector is heavier-duty than any others I have seen or used and it was easy to install on the player.The only problems are the volume scroller is hard to access and the belt clip(which I don't use) is pretty flimsy.I highly recommend this product.
3,An OK Case with a Terrible Clip,"I bought the black silicone skin case for my Sansa e250. The case fit my sansa very well and it was very easy to put on. The case looked nice on the sansa and it made the 5 buttons bellow the screen easer to press. There is one big drawback to the case: it doesn't have screen protection which is a big disappointment. It leaves the screen open to be scratched. Came with the black slick looking case was an ugly and cheap looking plastic white clip. Not only it didn't look good, it didn't work very well either. Since the case is kind of soft and stretchy, the clip attached to the case felt very insecure and not easy to use. Overall, I am not satisfied with this purchase because the two functions - screen protection and belt clip - that are most important to me were not provided by this product."
4,Good for your pocket!,"Good protection, but this skin have a bit problemsGet dusty very fast from your pocketHard to put on sansasometime it hard to use the bottom.The good thing isprotect very welleasy to clean by wash with hot waterHaving good feeling when using the sansa"
3,"half A-sides , half B-sides","If you liked the first album you'll like this one. All Your Love sounds a lot like Angel Eyes. It also has a couple of kick ass songs that get it done. Matijevic's voice is the reason to get this, simply amazing. Got a chance to see them perform this live in Denver and the live show is great."
4,Good CD...But This Post Below Me Is Stupid,"Hey idiot...it's not Steelheart at all...just the singer, Mike Matijevic. If you had any clue at all you'd know Jason Bonham, Zakk Wylde, Jeff Pilson & Nick Cantonese were never in Steelheart. Also FYI, all the songs in the movie aren't his voice...for the cover band the actual voice is Jeff Scott Soto. Do your homework next time."
3,A fine razor if you own more than one,"This is an excellent razor, but requires relentless care, and is too big for touch-ups or careful work under the nose on the upper lip. That being said, I am glad I have it, and the weekly care it requires pays off in the shave (particularly with Feather stainless DE blades). Merkur also has a fantastic rep for customer care in the USA; when part of my razor broke she replaced the part immediately, without question. That is a respect for the customer that has made me a Merkur partisan for life.I use the vision in conjunction with a 1962 Gilette red-tip, and between the two, I couldn't ask for more. But be forewarned, again, that the Vision requires a daily cleaning after use, and very careful weekly cleaning, if it is to remain a joy rather than a frustration."
2,2004 Video PLaymate Calender,"Guys don't waste your money on this. This DVD seems like those stupid movies on SHOWTIME or CINEMAX chanels. The only difference is the paymates, so the stars.Half the time of half the videos the playmate enters the building and then half of the remaining time the playmate takes her clothes off and then the guys eeekkkk....."
2,Disappointing...,"I agree with the previous reviewer - standards have definitely slipped. At least half of this year's girls are quite ordinary. Also, the production doesn't seem as classy as previous years somehow. However the inclusion of the delectable Lani Todd and the two 'smoothies' Teri Harrison and Penelope Jiminez do help redeem it somewhat."
2,Very disappointing,"Terri Harrison,Laurie Fetter & especially Lani Todd are the only women who make this worthwhile.Buy the 2002 Dvd."
1,Bow Wow,"With about four exceptions - Terri, Lani, Laurie and Marketa - you can have a similar experience for free by hanging out at the main entrance to the local dog pound. Playboy's standards have deteriorated - but yours shouldn't. Save your money."
4,Pretty!,"I love this eye liner! it goes on really smooth, and the smudge end also helps to smooth it out. It stays on all day over my primer and eyeshadow, and it allows you to make thick or thin lines. Depending on the eyeshadow, it looks darker or lighter shades of black. Overall, i would recommend this product."
5,the best gta yet,"this was by far the best gta ever. i really like how you could change clothes, eat, get some ink and get hair cuts. i know this might soung stupid, but i thought it was cool that you could finally swim. not only that, you could dive underwater too. it is about time they added that. anyways the game was great. way better then vice city. the land was not as flat, the was a better story, and the cj was way tighter then that fag from vice city. the only bad thing that i have to say is that it was too short, but maybe i only say that because i liked the game so much that i wanted it to go further."
5,"The reviewer with the title ""The End of Video Games""","You sir are a moron. Don't they have groups for people like you? Ever hear the term ""entertainment purpose only""??? These are what video games are. Kids are not stupid. Most know right from wrong and if they don't, it's more reflected on the parents. This has nothing to do with morals. I have strong family vales and morals, but I love to sit down and play games for ""ENTERTAINMENT"" I don't play San andreas and plot later that night to go knock over a conveniece store or take my car and run over hookers downtown. I can't stand you types of people. Don't like what your watching? Turn it off!! Don't like what your hearing? Turn it down. But don't come preach this BS of peoples morals lacking. Mind your business!!!!"
3,fun but violent,"Hi. To start of this review, I just want you to know Grand Theft Auto games are hella fun. BUT there are too much sex, swearing, and blood. At least if you shoot innocent bystanders in the head, at least their head shouldn't fly off and start bleeding everywhere just like in Halo. I have no idea why people these days like swearing, blood, and sex. You grand theft auto owners may think I'm nuts saying this about a game that's so fun, but it's true. Many parents complain about this game having bad influence on their kids. If you're a parent looking for a suitable game for your kid 10 and up, buy them games from the halo series, Jak series, ratchet and clank series, prince of persia series, dynasty warriors series, and the legend of zelda series. Unless you're over 18, I highly reccomend this."
5,Dis Game Iz PIMP....!!!!!!,Dawg after reviewing this game this game iz one uv the best games ever to b put out on2 da market. This game haz better graphics din all the other ones and if there wuz a challenge between GTAVC in dis dis game would blow Vice away. Every1 should buy this game. U buy it Ull luv it. Dus agme iz 10 timez betta than any game out there right now or even when this cums out. So dis game needs to b on every1z wish list 4 a game u wunt to get. Itz PIMP............!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Perfect!!!!,"This is the perfect gift for your ten year old!!!! Why get them to waste time on things like reading or playing sports, GTA is the perfect Saturday (or any day!) afternoon pasttime! I'm so glad GTA is advertised on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, otherwise how will kids know about getting the perfect game about stealing cars, gangsters and crack ho's!!!"
1,The CD was damaged when i opened it,Once i saw it in the mailbox i was really happy. But when i tried it on it didnt work. I finnaly realize that it was damaged on the side. I want a refund back to my card who ever sold this.
5,Eliephants,"This is another chapter in the series which will be great and every gta fan should get it. It is so real that if you eat too much you will become as fat as an Eliephant and if you don't eat enough you will become Anorexic like some people. You can get your own haircuts such as Mullets and look like a Gronk. You can start fires and get skateboard and build your own Casino and hir bodyguards to run it for you. It is set in the early 90's and is all about gangsters. It will have to be pretty good to be better than Vice City.Not long left to wait.PS. Hopefully you can egg peoples houses.PPS. This guy I Know reckons it won't be good, So i say to Him""Won't it be good my friend, Won't it."
5,Grand Theft Auto just keeps getting better!!,"The people from rockstar have really outdone themselves this time.I still cant belive that you can ride bikes ,swim,and you HAVE to eat.also trere is a mile high mountain.you can also rob houses at night and do gang drivebyes. there are gyms and if you eat too much and get fat,you can work it off by going to them or by riding up mount chiliad.I think this will be the best game of the year."
3,Needs Work,The biggest problem of this game is you have no weapons and the map to find the weapons is really useless.If you find a weapon your stuck with 9mm while the folks trying to wipe you out have a M-16.Last is nobody under the age of 18 should be playing it's to graphic and language.
4,Great game,"This is a fun game to pay if you are an ADULT. I would not buy this game for anyone under 15. There are gangs, curing and hookers. My nephew wnated this game and it was inappropriate from him. But for all the adults play on and don't forget the cheat codes!!!!"
5,Alsome Game,alsome game been playing it since i got it been playing for almost 7 hours and still not bored i recomend it to every body
4,this game is very hard 4\22\05,this game was cool but it had a bad side to it. the map is cool and your guy is cool. but i am stuck on a mission that you have to bounce your car up and down.
3,Grand Theft Auto- San Andreas,"I'm still not sure about this game. Don't get me wrong, I loved GTA 3 and Vice City, partly because you had the same character and a similar story line to go along with it. I have no problem with the character's appearance, but I wish Rockstar would have stuck with the same character and continue where GTA 3 left off. Another strange thing is the fact that this game is set in the 70's and in San Andreas... if you know where San Andreas is, it's not a ghetto at all. It's a pretty small hick town in California. Also, in the 70's, drive-bys were'nt as common as they are today. I think this game is very contradicting and isn't going to be as big as the originals."
2,Needs to come out on XBOX,Just played it on the PS2. Has plenty of potential with probrably the largest gameplay area yet out of any of the GTA's. The graphics although are the worst I've ever seen and the new colors they added in don't help. Most of the time you can't see anything because it's either too dark or the graphics are polygraphed out of this world. Rockstar needs to pull their heads out of their asses and releases this great game on a system that can handle it. Cause playing it on a PS2 is just a waste of time and money unlike the xbox.
1,Rockstar...your 15 min. of fame is up!,"Have you ever played Driver 2? Well...the graphics in San Andreas looks identical to it! I can't believe Rockstar put this sh*tty product out! Vice City's graphics were outstanding on the Xbox(even on the PS2, but not as good)and much sharper than San Andreas! Good word of advice for Rockstar: Stick with Microsoft...and leave that Zero(PS2)alone! The PS2 is dead!!!!!You got a problem with this review?......Take it personal. I'm headed back to Vice City(Xbox style). This was a false alarm."
1,"lousy, boring, cheap graphics","why doesnt anyone brag about GOOD games like jeapordy, wheel of fortune, and who wants to be a millionaire?"
5,Awesome....,"You have probably heard of this game somewhere else. It is extremely obscene, as you can tell from the big M on the rating stamp. Unlike Vice City, which ended just as you got used to the city, this game has an almost never-ending story line. The game map is a lot larger, as you can tell from the size of the fold out map included with the game. After unlocking several new areas, there are also bonuses like Hydraulic Competitions, Street Races, and cars can now have Nitrous Oxide. For hours and hours and hours of ADULT fun, I would greatly recommend this game."
5,Doesn't Get better!!!!!,Rockstar games have done it again and I hope they keep up the good work!!! If you don't like shoot em up games or games that are violent then this is NOT FOR YOU!!! SO DON'T BUY IT!!! This game is BIG and really cool and I love the blurring while speeding(good effect) Buy this I know you will enjoy IT!!!
1,Did not work,"This item I purchased for my son, we received it and it would work!!!! its was suppose to be in Very good condition"
5,I LOVE IT!!!,"This is one game I've played since it first came out. The only thing I've had trouble with is ""territory Take-over"".But, past that it is a very good game. Here's a tip for parents with kids who complain about this and previous gta games: Don't ever buy it for your kids."
5,a 12 year olds review....,i am a BIG fan of grand theft auto and i gotta say this is the BEST ONE EVER!!!!! i mean you can fly airplanes make the charater look the way you want him to(and yes you can still pick up hookers and when you do it the car shakes and you can hear them) i give it a 5 outta 5
4,BUY THIS GAME,"this is by far tha best gta game out, an theres loads more things to do on it. I completed it about a year ago and still play on it nearly every month.There's new, and better cars, funny hairstyles, kwl outfits, houses, motorbikes that go fast!!! planes (my fave) an you can finally swim. An when you do swim you see dolphins and fish!! (quiet freaky at first)also theres 2 player so get your mates round!!! i'm always on it, and I love it. One of my best games but by far my favourite is Dog's Life and Harry Potter. Check them out!!!"
5,"A Great Game, but not for kids!","This is a great game. My brother bought this for me for Xmas along with the book. I cannot imagine trying to play it without the book cause there are so many places you can go and so many directions in the game to go. I have not even gotten halfway through it yet but it is a great game. It is fun to drive around just looking at everything. I am not real fond of the music in the game, but there are some really cool vehicles to steal.<br />I highly reccommend this game to serious players. But I would not let anyone under at least 16 play it. It is very racial and has a ton of explicit language, which makes me laugh when I play it. But this one, it is worth the money."
5,Excellent!!!,"This game is unbelievable!!!! More features added to the already feature packed series!!!Heres some new stuff:-Bikes that require pedaling-Cops have motorcycles-More realistic (if you eat to much you get fat, the more you run and stuff the less fat you have)-You can swimThats just some new stuff. BUY this game.BUT BE WARNED, I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMENED THIS GAME TO ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 13!!!"
4,200th review!!!,Yeeesss im the 200th person to review GTA San andreas and its not even out yet! All hail Canada! This game will have a song from Rage Against the Machine which will be cool because they're a great band!
3,Step Down from Last Verson,"Sadly, I gave into the hype and bought the game. Here is why I am so disappointed in my choice:1) The character mtc activities (lifting weights, eating, cutting hair, etc.) should be optional and are annoying.2) The map is very hard to read and the symbols are very illegible. This causes you to have to go to the map and zoom in/out every minute or two just to figure out where you are going.3) The movie scences in between the mission are distracting and disappointing.Basically, game is more of a SIM game than a shootem' game like the last 2 versions.I would wait until you can buy a used version and save yourself $20."
5,Is San Andreas the best game ever?,"No! But it is really good. It feels a lot like the last two games. There are still glitches and sometimes the controls feel less than perfect (especially when on foot). Still, it's a good game and is almost as cool as AndyMetz.com."
4,GTA keeps getting better. Stop Hating on GTA,"I have read numerous previews of San Andreas in magazines and such and it seems like its going to be the best game ever of all time and only another GTA will be able to possibly top it. To all those people who say the game is too violent, thats what ratings are for and stop imposing your views on other people. However, I have seen some content that I wouldn't recommend to kids under 12 but for everyone over that age its okay. People underestimate all the X-rated stuff kids are exposed to. Sit at a high school lunch table and see what topics come up. Seriously, stop wasting your energy protesting this game. Its the capitalist way to supply what is in demand and I think I can speak for many when I say that GTA is in high demand. Shout out to PHS panthers.-16 yr old high school student"
5,THE BEST GAME EVER!,"This is the best game in the world!Its really cool you can make him fat by eating food over and over again.And the missions are very challenging,but fun!I really do recommend this game and i really recommend you to buy it!The game is really lifelike.And the graphics are very good.This is the best game i own and i own ALOT OF PS2 GAMES.There are 100s of cool fun things you can do in this game.The cars are very cool.You can go shopping you can buys houses get jobs and even have girlfriends you can even take karate and loose weight or gain weight or work and stuff. they have San francisco(san ferro),las vegas(las venturas)las angeles(los satos)etc.And many more towns.they have lots of cool things to do in this game and you will have to buy it to find out!I REALLY RECOMMEND GRAND THEFT AUTO SAN ANDREAS! GET THE GAME TODAY!I PROMIS YOU WILL LOVE IT!"
4,spectacular,"San Andreas the new release from the game proteges at rockstar is hard to sum up.the game itself is like enetering a different realm and setting. In previous gta games the player was allowed to travel within one city on multple islands. Now its almost unlimited southern cal type atmosphere within four gargantuan cities. the plot rolls out beaneath your eyes in an entrancing picture of 90's g-funk era california. Police brutality ,rival gangs, hoes, and homies all come into play while maintaining the splendor of the missions that gta has alway provied. There are a few weak spots such as the map(its tiny you cant see anything.) but overall the game holds up on its own."
5,Dont Complain,I think this game is awsome but everyone that complains about the language need to SHUTUP BECAUSE THE PACKAGE SAYS M FOR MATURE GAMERS ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU DONT WANT CUS WORDS GO RENT ELMOS ADVENTRUES OR SOMETHING THIS GAME IS NOT ENTENDED FOR CHILDREN so dont complain if the only reason you dont like the game is because of the foul languge its not for PREMATURE little infants that have to have there moms wipe there @$$ after they sh** now stop fu**ing complaining about the language in it .anyway i bought this game the first day it came out and im still playing it. It is really awsome expecually the 2 player in it being able to do drive bys with a friend is like the coolest thing ever. The Missions are pretty awsome also the graphics are good to. well enough said.........
4,Technically amazing,"I remember being totally wowed by GTA III, then equallly wowed by Vice City. San Andreas brings the GTA series to another level of stunning technical achievement. The sheer size and and scope of the environment you play in is enough to merit 5 stars on its own. However, this time around, I think the folks at Rockstar ran out of ideas and it feels like (toward the end in particular) missions become sort of pointless and add very little to the story, the game's creators are almost saying ""look at how much we can stuff on to one CD"" rather than adding more worthwhile content to enhance the story.From a technical aspect, the game is 5 stars, from a gameplay and story aspect, it's 3 stars. Overall 4 stars."
4,Best of the GTA trilogy,"Overall this is the best of the GTA series that I have played. This game has proven challenging thus far, and I am about half way through and have found that this game has everything that the previous GTA had and more. For instance you can gain ""territories"" by fighting out gang wars in the beginning of the game. The story line moves much broader than just a small time South Central based story line as you get to travel throughout the entire state. Where the novilty of GTA3 wore off pretty quickly on me, Vice City I stuck out till the end, but this one I have not been able to stop. Ive pushed off playing Halo 2 to finish this one. Definitly worth checking out."
5,This game rocks!Shut-up MAVV!,"This video game is the best!I love it!All the people protesting itcan shove-it.What is wrong with you stupid Activists?Why would people who like this game want to hear your babiling.Your just trying to push your morality on other people and that's not right!Don't play it if you don't like it, and don't let YOUR kids play it if you don't want them to.So respect other peoples choices youwhiny you buttholes!GTA is one of the greatest games ever, Vice Citywas in the Guiness Book of World Records over 9 Million copies soldand I was one of them.See yah!Oh yeah,F*** you MAVV!"
3,I'm tired of this stuff.,"The gameplay is an improvement over the last 2 GTA games, but honestly I'm just tired of this genre of game. I think it's been played out, and at this point, I think the imitators are in fact doing it better than the original."
1,"Ya, its cool",Ya its cool how everyone keeps reviewing this game and its not even out. Games like Everquest 2 already have 3.5 stars which is unfair because its not even out and this doesent deserve the 4.5 it has because its not out. Its out in 8 days; review it in 8 days.
5,Gangsta all they way (10 oout of 10),I LOVE GTA'S I LOVED GTA 3 AND VICE CITY BUT I CAN NOT WAIT UNTIL SAN ANDREAS CUZ ITS GOING TO BE THE BEST I ALSO HEARD THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A STRIP CLUB AND THE GIRLS REALLY STRIP SO THATS GOING TO BE AWSOME BUT ANYWAY GRAND THEFT AUTOS IS THE BEST CRIME GAME EVER TO BE MADE!
5,Infinite Outta 5,"I know more than ANYBODY in the world about this and GTA VC. I am the biggest fan EVER and I got it the first day it came out. Its the Best I almost beat it cuZ it's the best. Get it there's a FAT LOAD of s*** you can do the graphics rule and the controls Rock. This, Super Mario 64 (and Super Mario 64 Ds), Backyard Wrestling, GTA:VC, and Red Dead Revolver are thee Best games. Get it for 49.99 (I think it's worth 100,000 bucks), The best game I play everyday GTA:SA I Luv GTA:SA get this fat load of fun for only 49.99 reminder GET IT."
5,I'd rather give it 10 stars,"(...)Now to the game. This is definitely gonna be the coolest game ever. I mean Vice City was tight but this looks even better. It's good to see that the usual mobster storyline is mostly gone, and now it's gonna take place in the projects, where gang wars are currently taking place. I will definitely try to buy this game, and if I don't have enough cash, I'll try to steal it because this very well may be the greatest video game ever invented.Only 2 months left"
5,Tight!,"Like all the other ""Grand Theft Auto"" games, this is going to great. Only this time this is the ULTIMATE game, period! I can't wait to play Carl, who will be the next character in the game, set in San Andreas. Playing a gangsta this time is going to be tight.I heard the soundtrack is going to be tight too. 2pac, Cypress Hill, and Rick James are just the few of the artists to play their music in the game.I'm counting down the clock, baby!"
4,Pretty good,Uhh!! Well I liked Vice City a little more because it was easier 2 beat! I only bought it because I like stealing cars and shooting! WhenI started to play it it was easy but I just got so frustrated after thring a mission I gave up and played another game! So if u want to not be stressed out do not buy this game!!!!!
3,"Well, its okay.....","I mean, everything has been improved for the most part. I just think the islands suck as far as layout. All the extras are very nice though. I don't really like the whole ""gangsta"" feeling either. I was much more interested in Vice Citys rockish theme. Also, the rewards for 100% are ALOT worse for this game than Vice. But ill do it just for the sake of completion. I think ill go replay GTA 3 now. Cheers"
5,Only 4 Hous to go for some ppl!,Its only 4 hours til the game is out! here is some info i hav...The major airport in Las Vencuras can give you a $500 dollar flight to San Feirro.You can gamble in the casinos.Mountain bikeRide Big Monster Trucks!SwimEatRob Peoples HomesRadio StationsThere will be alot of radio stations...here are some.Master Sounds 98.3Play BackBounce FMK-DSTK-Jah Radio West (sound familer from GTA 3)CSR 103.9Radio:X The AlternativeK-RoseRadio Los SantosSF-URWeaponsShovelKatanaFire ExtinguiherChainsawSilenced PistilUziTec-9Dark ShotgunChrome ShotgunAK-47M-4Rocket LancherDesert EagleHeat Seeking RPGVulcan Mini GunThanks for reading.
5,This is the greatest gta game ever!!!,This game has it all the funny radio stations the fun missions and a huge environment to do what ever you want.<br />but after you beat the game it gets very boring because there is not very much to do. but the game is better than halo 2
2,TruthMedia,"Here is a link to a credible independant reviewing source through SA. They don't have the financial ties to the big companies that IGN and the other reviewing sites have, so they cut through most of the hype that companys want to generate for a game.http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=2478"
4,The work of a sheer genius... but a sick genius,"Alright... so you keep thinking about buying this game. My advice, if your old and mature enough to understand the difference between reality and fiction THEN BUY THIS GAME! This is rockstar's best ever game. I beleive this is the best game of this year. This game takes gameing experience to the edge. With tons of action and everything you could want out of a reality series viseo game. If you name it, San Andreas has it. There is a but, however, if your a parent, I would not recommend this game to your children under the age of 12. This game could have affects on small children. If you play responsibly though, this should be one of the best games you'll ever play. I say ""BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!"
3,Silliness,I went 3 pages deep into the so-called reviews before I'd had enough. What a waste of Amazon's disk space. Reviews should not be allowed until a product is released. It's not a discussion board.That's my 2K worth...
5,One of the best games ever,"At the time of this writing, GTA V has been announced and I've read up on it and it looks great...however since I've not played it, GTA San Andreas is my favorite GTA game to date (yes ever better than the newer GTA IV). There is so much to do! There are so many vehicles, missions, terrains, missions, and side-missions, that you can play this game for a long time and still be entertained, even after you've beaten the main story.I keep coming back to this game because it's great...I loved it so much, I bought it for two platforms (PC and PS3)."
2,Not sure,"I also ordered for Grandson, I'm sure he loves it. But I think it's a little rough. As long as he likes"
5,this is crazy i did not know a game couled get this good,rockstar how did you do it the best games ever made came from you this is ane example this game is the best! Plaeeeeeeeese keep it uppppp hay hay hay midnight culb 3
5,Best GTA Game yet,"The GTA Seris has done alot to the PS2 it is one of the top selling games for the PS2, and look even the Xbox is stealing your game. The reason the GTA seris is so fun is because of alot of things. They give you the freedom of running free around a huge map of fun mini-games and extra stuff to do like gamble sell drugs kill people run over people shoot people and all those fun ways that Rockstar games has given us to kill those hookers. There is alot of improvement to the Vice City like you can swim now, and you have to keep up with your health and respect and when your hungry. There are hundreads of missions to keep you happy and lots of hookers waiting to die by the varity of cheats and guns the game allows you to have. Rockstar games makes running over highly-paid stripers fun. This game is so fun people have started to play this so much oprah is not popular anymore. Yeah its that fun. I give it 5 stars by all means."
3,Harder than a mo'fo'!,"Okay, just so you have an idea of how sadistic this game is: I was /given/ it. I had wanted to buy it for months after it released, but a friend of mine said he was stuck on the VERY FIRST tagging mission, did all the fun stuff, and was easily tired of it.Now, I've gone and surpassed him in the game, surpassing my own expectations as well with how many missions I did. But now I'm beginning to sympathize with him. I sold it off because you just can't do any one thing more than 20 times and still contain the enthusiasm you had the first time around. It's not a game. It's a pain in the ass, and a sigh of relief for my wallet. Do yourself a favor and don't yearn for something that will end up making you ten times more frustrated than you were before picking it up."
3,Getting old,"I got this because I loved the previous games. Unfortunately this one is just getting old. The missions for the most part are all rehashes from the previous versions. The good part is that you can drive to different cities without reloading. Other than that this game is somewhat of a waste. It is also lacking the humor that the earlier games had. The signs around town are all too realistic and the radio lost its funny bone. Sure, now you can go to the gym and get pumped up (not that it's difficult) and you have to pay to eat but these elements don't do anything for the overall enjoyment of the game. I wish I would have waited for it to drop in price instead of getting it right away."
5,the game that will change the world,the graphics are great the sounds are perfect. If you want a sweet game this is it you can do anything you want to in this game. it is just like real life except you cant get hurt in this game this is the coolest game next to god of war.
5,Best game since Vice City!,"Same graphics as GTA:3 but a hole lot better! You never used to be able to swim,fly planes,or spawn jetpacks this game is the best! If you are looking for a game with fun and stradegy packed in one this the game for you."
1,gta when will people realize it sucks after 10 minutes,gta is ok for the first few days. but after a while it gets too repetitive. i can play any game in the series for about 15 minutes then im bored. anyone who has a brain dont get this piece of crap.when will they give gta a multiplayer. this would make it so much better. and whats up wiht exercising to lose weight. this game sucks.
1,Recommended for EMO ROCK LOSERS OR 10 YEAR OLDS or both,Just like the despcription this recommended for emo rock losers(the losers that listen to truly terrible music like Good Charlotte or Sum 41)and 10 year old boys/girls that are immature and like wasting their time and money on trash like this and this isn't teaching those kids(teens with no taste in video games)nothing new just to be hateful or violent. This video game is just another rip-off of Vice City and this one horrid. Please parents burn or break those PS2'S or X-BOX's your kids have and that will teach them a listen not to bring crud like this and those other games in your household and if your kids rent or buy this please smash it with a hammer and burn it to pieces and tell your kids that if you wanted to waste your money on trash you could have thrown it into the trash can and you would have got trash in return. The only good thing this has achieved is that is released a box set of the music in the game.
3,GTA 5,"This game is pretty boring, its the same old same old, shooting killing, shooting killing, dont waste your money on this, the only good thing is that it has a differemnt name"
4,this is gonna be a really good game,"This game from my point of view is gonna be great but i dont know that fo' sho' till i play that game right thur i wont know.but i do know it will be tha bomb cause my homies at rockstar hooked us all up with grand theft auto 3 and vice city so it has to be off the heazy plus you can ride bikes i mean in the hood, that how we would do me and my homies. a very good feature is that u can work out and be like debo from friday or if you eat to much than your gonna be a fat slob and if you dont eat as much as you should you be real skinny.my favorite part of the game is that you gone be able to recruit yo' own gang i mean how cool is that well im out peace>:("
2,Great Game but Too Violent,"I watched a friend play San Andreas on the PS2. I have to admit, it rivals Halo 2 on the Xbox and proves to be an extremely solid title for the PS2. Even if I played for just half an hour, I am ashamed of myself for having fun when I played this game. I can't believe I and other people have fun shooting innocent people. I know it's a video game but if people will do those things in video games, how hard will it be for them to do it in real life. Take my advice, play other FPSs that don't teach violent morals. Like Halo, for example. You fight to survive, instead of living a life of crime."
5,I TESTED THE GAME,"Hello al i have tested the game first had and for one thing the loading is no longer an issue, it loads as fast as you can snap you fingers.But for you who dont know, in this installment of the GTA series you can swim! and you can change what your charecter looks like so that each game is unique. you can join a gang or chreate one that will follow you arownd, you and sneak into peoples houses and rob them of jewlery, money, and even the house itself.And when i said that you could customize your charecter i mean that buy buying cloths, jewlery, haircuts, tatoos, and much much more. but on the downside your charecter can get fat if you feed him too much and dont give him enof excersize which you can do by running or riding your bicyecle arownd.you can also run your own casiano wich ill bring in big bucks very quikly, and for eny one that expects this game to suck then i just whant to see the looks on your faces as you play it."
3,"pretty good,but not great","I was getting pretty sick of paying 50 bucks for games that Icould play through in one or two days ( or not play at all like Half life 2 ) when I bought San Andreas. This game kept me busy for three and a half months,and I still only completed 96%. Though not a great game overall there can be great moments.Driving slow thru bad guy turf at night,in the rain,Patsy Cline on the radio. Ahh memories,memories."
4,Will be A Great Game,"I absolutely love playing GTA games they are like playing a gangster movie which is basically pure entertainment. I can fully understand why they chose to use a black character. I mean as a white man i can't lie and say i don't notice that most of the youth wanna be black. Black people are popular in sports, musically they have taken over the world lol and hmm why not take over computer games especially since gta incorporates alot of music into the gaming experience. Despite the odd one or two racist kids whom are clearly out of touch with the rest of the world i think its a great idea and will probably boost sales"
5,Fire,"diSz game iSz fire. iSz like ur actually livin CJ'zS life. if u eat tOo muCh u becOme fat and if u dOnt eat at aLL u becOme skinny. if u exercise u get abs and muscles.u get to swim, do marathons, fly airplanes, ride bikes, hook up cars. diSz game got it all point blank. wen ur respect goes up u get ta run da streets. i definitely suggest for u to buy diSz game. the onlii thing iz dat they curse too much, so if ur a kis i suggest u put the volume down, u feel? DiSz has been a message from xXIceXx"
4,Can't mess with this!,"The next Installement for this Smash Hit looks Promissing. GTA3 and ViceCity were just amazing. Now comes San Andreas with loads of new features like swimming, riding bikes, plot robberies etc. (keep in mind that I heard these rumurs, but I promiss there all in it). I also heard that you play as a guy named CARL. There's gonna be 3 cities to roam in too! you're gonna need to eat food while you're on your journey, so that means Carl is gonna have a stamina metre. To me, this game is gonna rock!!! I advise everyone to get this game as soon as it's released."
5,Shoot the complaining parents,"i dont have the new gta but i played all the other gtas there was. I was in 4th grade or 3rd grade when i played the first GTA1 that was from topdown and i played All gtas ever since. My favorite series ever. Now i dont go shootin people or joyriding coz of the game, gta actually keeps this away probly, coz if ur curious of doin it, then instead u can do that s-h-i-t on tv and not in real life, but i do have one wish, if id know the parents and who ever complainin that GTA's bad for society id shoot them or chop em up with a chainsaw. peace!!!"
4,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,I think this game will be much better than the others because you can do a lot of new things like swim and eat food. This game will be kind of like a sim because they have made it so realistic . My favourite game is vice city but i have a feeling it will change soon enough. You can also round up a gang of three people and do drive bys and if you eat to much you will be called fat by pedestrians. The story line of the game also is suppose to be fantastic. I eill buy this game as doon as it comes out who ever dosn't by it is a fool because this game is going to be sensational
2,The Most FUSTRATING Game EVER,"Sure this new version has plenty of fun extras, but who can honestly say they enjoy playing one pointless mission after the next. About 75% of the missions in this game could be taken out because they either have nothing to with the actual story or they are extremely aggrevating to play...seriously, some of the missions could almost make me kick my television in. And for anyone who has been to the flying missions knows that the controlls could use a vast improvement. Other then that, I'll agree with anyone else that San Andreas has (some) qaulity moments, but only play the missions if your looking for stress."
5,Fun and Realistic!,"I got this game as a Christmas Present Christmas 2004, and to tell you the truth, it's a really fun game! Way better than GTA: Vice City, even if the skins and graphics were toned down a bit.There's so much to do, by the time you think you've done a lot, you'll have barely scratched the surface, and the whole day will have gone by. Oh well, tomorrow's another day!5/5, no doubt about it."
5,Great Game but takes forever to unlock things.,"This is a great game. But for the people that just like to go around killing people and go into stores and rob them this is not a good game for you. If you are not good at doing missions you will not be able to do much in this game unless you get a cheating system[example:gameshark, Action Replay, Codebreaker exc.] You can not go to the the other islands or stores or half the other stuff in this game. You can't even go to a resteraunt without unlocking it through a mission first. But if you are good at missions and enjoy blowing people up with heat-seaking missles you NEED TO BUY THIS GAME. I hope you found this reveiw helpful."
5,This is the greatest game ever made!,"Wow, I was amazed how great this game actually is. Not only is it better than the games before it, it is far better than any game i've ever played. This is a total keeper, no doubts!!!"
5,The game,I have just played this agme it is amazing i couldnt belive itall of my friends pre orded it but i said ahh i will wait but was i wrong i could not stop the sound is amazing. The other reviews say that it has bad languege bad every thing but that is not true ya they curse a little but i mean wat games dont. It has fun violance that you might see in the Matrix but that is cool so all in all this game can be great for any 1
1,Over-rated,"When I first played this game, I got bored in 10 minutes.All you do is shoot and kill people for nothing, have the police chase you and you shoot them, Bring girls into your car and do it with them. I dont recommend this game at all its overrated."
1,THIS GAME IS SO DANGEROUS,[...]This game is so dangerous because when somebody on the game jacked his car he fell down and broke out in a seizure. I WAS SO SCARED.
1,A review on Grand Theft Auto,"We always tell our children not to lie, steal, cheat, and murder. Why would we spend all the time we spend trying to raise our children to become successful adults, only to buy a game like Grand Theft Auto SanAndreas, which goes against all the rules? This game has everything we fight against everyday looking as if it's oKay because it is a game. There are corrupt Policemen, men picking up prostitutes, and different gangs, just to name a few. Even though this game is marked for mature audiences it is sure to be seen by children. At what point do we say enough is enough, our children are confused enough, let's keep games fun and positive."
1,Lunatics,"How are you lunatics writing 150 positive 5 star reviews for a game that is not released? Go review something that you have played and completed, that makes you able to rate something, your guesses are unrateable."
3,Graphics aren't everything but.............,"This game is just a larger version of GTA 3 and Vice City with a few gimmicks thrown in. It still suffers from many problems which may not bother some but totally take me out of the game.The game is graphically poor maybe even below the quality in Vice City. I couldn't imagine putting in the 40+ hours required to finish this game as it gets old in a hurry.However, Who can blame Rockstar. I'm sure they'll milk the GTA cashcow for all it's worth. Maybe the next entry can have a little less size and a little more polish.IGN 9.9 ?????Gamespot 9.6 ?????Come on guys. I know giving mad props to these high profile games adds some cashflow to your websites but let's not get crazy here."
1,MGS3 IS BETTER....................................,I HATE OVER RATED GAMES.................THE GAME ISNT THAT GOODTHE GRAFICS SUCKIT ALWAYS GLINCHESFUN FOR 2 SECONDSNOT FOR ALL AGESFOR FUN WITH MGS3MORE FUN EVEN WITH A GBA GAME.............MINISH CAP!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Sick, Sad, and Useless","First off, this game is a slap in the face to Black people everywhere. I know, I know the other games poked fun at Italian moffia stereotypes...but this one goes TOO FAR. The language is horrible, and the story line is very Boyz in the Hood. I'm not sure why these games are so popular because they all seem exactly alike to me. The graphics are terrible (only because their is so much going on...but still). The personalization is a gimick and adds little to the game play (okay so if you get fat you won't run very well and people will call you a ""fat ass""). This game is over rated (think HALO on XBOX) and offensive to both Black people and gamers (this game is just a recycle of the same ole' same ole'). RockStar should stop making GTA games until the next wave of consoles hit-maybe then they can something other than GTA 3.3"
2,I needed this game for a class project on violent video games,If my sons were still living with me I would never purchase a video game of this type for it promotes violence and glorifies it.But one thing for sure it did show validity to our theory of have violent video games can effect the behavior of children or any player if they continue to play it over and over again.
4,red and yellow black and white,"the lead character is a............. human being! who cares what color. what i do care about is peelin around in a 64 impala shootin some rival gang members, and thats all gta is about. from the sounds of it this is going to be the best game ever, not just for the gta series, but of all time. Im counting down to 10/19/04ill be first in line"
3,city too big,"1. the city is way too big.2. the airplane missions suck3. it was better driving without the analog stick, if it aint broke..."
4,AMAZING GAME,GREAT GAME BUT IT HAS SOME FRAME RATE ISSUES.SOMETIMES MY GAME WOULD PAUSE FOR LESS THAN A SECOND DUE TO FRAME RATES. THAT TELLS ABOUT THE DATED PS2. ALSO THE GRAPHICS LOOK A LITTLE OLD.OTHER THAN THOSE MINOR ISSUES THE GAME IS PRETTY MUCH FLAWLESS. GO AND BUY IT ASAP. ITS WORTH MORE THAN THE $50 PAID.
1,HA HA HA WHAT A JOKE ITS EVEN WORST THEN GTA 3 VICE CITY,WOW THIS GAME IS THE WORST GAME I EVER SAW this game says all kind of swear words including the very bad F...word and whats up with this game..they make all the black people a bunch of crap and thats not right ROCKSTAR GAMES ARE NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF STUPID RACIST .....WHATS THE POINT OF THIS GAME EXEPT FOR RUNNING AROUND AND DOING MISSIONS WERE YOU HAVE TO KILL SOME ONE.... this game is so awful its even worst then that[...]vice city game ha amazing what kind of games are out today i know a 8 year old who has this game so ROCKSTAR GAMES[...]
3,"In the words of The Rock ""Shut The Hell UP!""","I think its the rock that says that. any how, you all need to get a life, i have been reading all the reviews and have notised most of you are all dips. first off the game will most likely be a good one but we do not know yet so stop saying its good. secound stop saying all the in fo of the game, if people want in to then go to the site, and last i do aggre to a certin point that games do cause violence but thats only beacuse the LITTLE BA*TA*DS! are all ready FU**ed up. and most of the people that play the games are good people that would only hurt others if it was the right thing to do. so all of you shut the hell up! sorry for the bad words, crapy grammer, and sorry if i hurt you...(the games is not out yet for me for a nother 15hr)"
1,Hey peeps,I wonder if there will be 300 reviews by the day its released... so far theres 112 if you count mine.... hmmm....
5,best game in the world,"this game you can do anything sure it has bad graphics but not as bad as twin snakes on ps1 but it still makes up for its really awesome and fun best things: you can do whatever you want,really good weapons, good cars, customizable cars,customizable character,exacutions,you can fly jets and airplanes unlike gta iv,there is over a hundered cheats and there is bigfoot leatherface ufos zombies all that and on top of that one of the cheats makes you fly best game ive ever played in my life buy it and you wont regret it"
5,G.T.A. Sanandras,"I like everything about this game. Free-rome arount the cities and borrow (steal). Steal everything driveable, flyable, moveable.Or do missions from several of people and with submission thears about 90 hours of playing time. My apetion is you should get GRAND THEIF AUTO SanAndreas"
3,Somewhat disappointing.,"On the drawing board, GTA San Andreas sounds perfect, make new missions, a new and longer storyline, new vehichles, new weapons, and a hidden CoOp mode. But in execution San Andreas feels all to familiar. The graphics are pretty much the same, as is the engine. The concept is also the same so really it feels all around like something I've played before. The workout/eating idea may sound good but actualy serves to be a pain in the [...]. While it's not groundbreaking like everyone says, GTA San Andreas can provide a lot of fun to newer gamers, while veterans may be a bit disppointed."
1,Remove company logo and I'll buy it!,I would actually buy this if it didn't have the company logo on it taking up half the sticker. Remove that and you've got yourself a sale.
5,YOu Can Play the Harp,I have set a goal for this decade of my life to learn to play the harp. I'm not a musician but this is my passion for a long time. Even I can understand the instructions and they are working!
5,You Can Play The Harp!,"I got this book on a whim, which turned out to be a great decision. The book came on time, and in great condition. Oh and I love the book, it's AWESOME. Easy to read. :)"
5,scary,these movies were a gift and I will say the recipient enjoyed the gift because he enjoys waching scary movies
5,"Best Holly CD, but new version is a better value","The music here is the best, but this set is available at a much better price as the newerBuddy Holly Gold."
5,Still waiting for a comprehensive boxed set,"I begrudgingly have to give this 5 stars because it's the best we can do, but...Why on earth is there no comprehensive boxed set of this seminal rock legend? There was a decent LP boxed set that has never been released on CD, I'd even settle for that.Come on, his career wasn't that long - though incredibly influential - why don't we have a boxed set that gives us virtually all of the original recordings remastered in original format?He and we deserve it."
2,Great Material...too pricey$$$,"Low stars for overpricing this CD when you can buy the same CD titled Buddy Holly ""Gold"" for a fraction of the price.Another example of corporate greed."
5,Buddy,It came in good shape and in good time. Excellent album. It has deeper cuts that you don't hear on the radio.
2,Terrible Editing,"I watched this novela on tv and wanted to buy it because I enjoyed it so much. However, this DVD is TERRIBLE!! They left out so many parts and it is always jumping from one scene to the next. There are no smooth transitions. I wish I hadn't bought it at all because it was definitely not worth the money."
1,Save your money!,"English Subtitles!Episodes 1 - 7 were boring!Episodes 8 - End were good.Most of the telenovela only showed Daniel and Eva; so 10 - 11 hours of the same two people.Although the acting was good, the problem was probably in the editing - someone deciding they knew which parts we wanted to see; yet the editor got it all wrong. The good thing about this telenovela is that is was filmed in the U.S.A. (Florida and California).Disk 2 was fuzzy for many of the episodes.If you are considering this DVD for learning Spanish then you might want to look elsewhere as the voice and diction of the Spanish here is not very clear - except for Julio (the old man). However, the voice and diction is acceptable.P.S. The best part of this DVD was the singing of Ave Maria during the last 13 minutes of the telenovela."
2,Abridged too far,"I misread the run-time when ordering this, so was unprepared for the degree of abridgement. It doesn't work: characters and situations leap ridiculously out of nowhere. Telenovelas are not known for their dramatic subtleties, but this abridged version of Eva Luna has been so drastically cut down that it lurches from one screaming dénouement to another. Sub-plots are made virtually incomprehensible by the chaotic slashing of storylines.This dvd is little more than a string of the 'last time on...' resumés which appear before each episode.I bought it because telenovelas are usually a fun, easy way of improving my Spanish. This overly-abridged dvd version was not fun. It was annoying."
5,Impossible to Say No to Joe,"How can anyone not love a book by Lori Foster? She is one of the best writers out there. Her characters will keep you up all night as they did me. Luna Clark is so believable that I felt like I really knew her. And Joe, well you've just got to read this delightful book to learn why it's just about impossible to SAY NO TO JOE. I adored this wonderful book and I think you will too. Really, I do."
2,SAME OLD...ALWAYS A BROTHER OR A COUSIN!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've read all of Lori's books. And I would always buy them as soon as they go on sale. However, I'm getting BORED! She started writing series romances...then branched out. However, for once I would like Lori to write an original book that stands on it's own. All these books that she's putting out have characters from previous books and it's GETTING OLD!!! (HUNKY BROTHERS OR COUSINS) I cringe when reading a book that starts talking about the hero's cousin or brother...cause you then know there's the next book in the making. Even the erotic romances for Kensington Brava have tie in characters.This book was predictible as to who the bad guy was. And much too much filler. This book was around 400 pages and could have been condensed to the size of a series romance.I hate to say it...but this will be my last purchase new of a Lori Foster book. I'll wait to get a copy at the used book store."
2,Not her best book by far...,"I've really enjoyed her previous books but this one is just no chemistry between the characters, sex in front of children, and unbelievable change of heart from a player to a one woman man!If you want a good Lori Foster book read Wild."
3,To everything there is a season......,"Say No to Joe? fits the fast, fluffy, hot summer read catagory!Do you have to think? No! Do you have to analyze? No! Just sit back and relax and let the macho mans man, Joe Winston take charge and lavish you with his brawn, his love and most of all his Lust!When Luna Clark finds out she has some orphaned relations she hooks up with the big bad Joe for help and guidence. The chemisty sparks but practical heads keep them in-line while they set up a home for the orphans. A bit of danger and mystery keeps the two together until they can't take it!Get out the suntan lotion and find out what happens next in Say No to Joe?"
5,Brilliant!,"What a story! Nat Hennessey and Cush Walker are the two main characters in this un-putdown-able crime/murder/love story, who really don't like each other much at all - they are fighting over the same woman who is in a coma.The story is brilliant - so many twists & turns that I never ever saw coming. This has got to be one of the best novels I have read..the only negative aspect - it is a bit long & because all the characters are interwoven within in each other, it gets a bit confusing but definately keep reading...it is well worth the ending!I can't wait to read another Stanley Pottinger book, these are the sort of books I love - not just a boring whodunit, or why they did it or even a boring romance..it has everything a good book should & heaps more! If only there were more like this..."
1,Not worth reading,All I can say is that this was one of the worst books I have ever read. I couldn't stand any of the main characters.
1,what a waste,"I can't believe that people will not only read this garbage, but will actually praise it. What possible reasons can there be for this level of gratuitous violence and graphic sadistic detail? Answers: to appeal to the lowest commmon denomimator of human behavior and wring a profit from it. What kind of world is this..."
4,ok and just enough,"I enjoyed this book. this was the first I had read by Pottinger. He did a good job of holding my interest even though I did not really believe in the subject of the plot. This book did not drag, rather the story line shifted fast enough not to lose the reader but fast enough to keep my interest."
1,A Slow Burn,"I agree with Stephanie Lewis: this is an awful book. I like convoluted plots but this was totally lacking in credibility, and in parts was just plain unpleasant. I just skipped through most of the second half, which seemed to be getting weirder and weirder."
1,Put it down and couldn't pick it up,"I stopped around page 69. I'm sure some people can stomach this kind of drivel, but this has to be one of the worst books I have seen in a couple of years.I didn't care for the characters. I am bored to tears when everything seems to have a racial overtone (aren't we suppose to be a color blind society?).This one is heading for the garage sale pile,"
5,The Best,"I feel this is the best SM music ever produced (based on my musical/musicality tastes), although I really love his work with Dave Larue and Van Romaine. I love those guys. If only SM would stop wasting my time working with DP, produce and tour more with the SMB, I and many other folks I know would be a lot happier. Heck, DP won't even play any of the SM written for DP music on tour, so what's the point of seeing them. Much gig money wasted there."
5,YES!,"Much better than Dakota Kid and those are much better than David, that's for sure.Nice BIG seeds and minimal other gunk in with the seeds. (bits of dried stem bits, etc)If you want a sunseed worth eating, this is it. And the bag size is a bit easier to deal with than 14-16 oz sized ones."
1,Wanna slow CF card?,"I'm using this card since two week now, i just have to admit it, this card makes my camera the slowest one i ever try. Putting back the 8meg card that came with it, gives back it's speed. I'm using a Nikon2100. My advice, save yourself some time and and buy another brand."
1,CAN'T RATE WHAT U CAN'T READ ABOUT,I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW TO FIND A LISTING OF THE INDIVIDUAL SONGS ON EACH DISC.
3,How to become a cultured citizen,"A Guide to the Active Enjoyment of the Arts and of Living.""A guide to the active enjoyment of the arts and living."" Considers all the art forms as well as love, marriage, politics and religion. Epicurean philosophy. Title page says ""This work is of American origin"". Unclear whether this is intended as a recommendation or a warning. But a fascinating plainly written book."
2,Not as advertised,"This book is chocked full of activities for self-discovery, and many are useful for a group therapy setting. There are even suggestions on how to vary the activities and discuss results with the group. However, I found that the majority of the activities have nothing to do with drama and would be better suited for an art therapy or journaling group."
4,The Magic of Remember the Magic is ExtremelyTame!,"The story is everything fluffy, warm, fuzzy and unexciting. If you are a devoted fan of Donna Fletcher, you'll probably love this book. Those of us who have never read her works and was anticipating dramatic escapades, it was surprisingly bland and continually flat. I noted the storyline was heavy into messages against prejudice and preaching how one should look at life. I didn't find the messages overwhelming to the point of reader overload; the book just wasn't what I was expecting from reading the back cover. To give Remember the Magic its due, it did keep my interest. It was a pleasant tale and I enjoyed it, but I doubt I will look for more books by this author as I like my books with a more rousing storyline.It appears Remember The Magic is a somewhat sequel to Wedding Spell. Just because Remember The Magic wasn't for me, it doesn't mean it wasn't a good book and should pass up."
2,"Nice, but not superfical","Joel's book is well written but is at a very high level and is not practical. I picked it up twice and put it down. You would be better off reading the Mythical Man Month, a real classic."
5,Fun,"This book is a fun ride.Although the hidden messages seem to be for managers, developers and others will have a good time reading it as well. (ok, the messages are not so hidden....)My favorite chapters were The Joel Test, Guerrilla Interviewing, Getting things done when you're a grunt, etc.... some of the more technical rants are fun too. The chapters on business stuff: Ben and Jerry's, Microsoft loosing this war or that one, were not as engaging, so I tended to simply skim them.Overall, I'd say buy this book... used. It doesn't have much of a reference life, and isn't something I feel compelled to read again in a few years. But I would recommend buying it."
2,ok product...,"Great idea, but WAY too heavy and bulky for the young audience it's intended for. Also, although it has auto shut off, our batteries wore out after just 2.5 months. Auto shut off also seems to happen really quick on ours."
1,flashlight you can't keep lit,"We purchased this toy for our daughter and she had so much trouble with it. Every time she would shine it on something she would turn it off by hitting the off button that was RIGHT ON THE HANDLE where you are supposed to hold the flashlight. This the worst design of a toy I have seen yet and I see a lot! The toy companies should have children and mothers help design toys. I do not know why anyone would put an off switch on the only place tou can hold it, especially a child. Thank you for listening."
3,I just want to walk right out of this world.,"This was the first Ramones album released after they left Sire Records, and also the first studio album recorded after Dee Dee quit the band. It's not a classic Ramones album by any means, but it does have it's moments. Even without Dee Dee in the band, he still contributed the best songs on the album; ""Poison Heart"", ""Strength to Endure"" and ""Main Man"". Joey wrote seven songs for the album, most of which are decent, but none of them are all that memorable. Marky Ramone also contributed his first two songs to this album, which are okay. There is one cover song on the album, which is the Doors' ""Take It As It Comes"", and it's actually one of the better songs on the album. While this isn't one of the Ramones' best albums, Ramones fans should enjoy it."
5,later ramones albums are so underrated!,"prior to buying this album, i had heard almost nothing off of it. i saw the music video for poison heart on youtube, but other than that, the album was a mystery. to me, it is like a combination of brain drain and pleasant dreams. it works greatly, although it isnt as good as either of them, it is still damn fine in its own right.as for this edition, i think the captain oi re-issue versions of brain drain, mondo bizarro, acid eaters, and adios amigos are the best editions we are going to be seeing for a while. it would be nice if rhno re-issued these(along with animal boy and halfway to sanity) somewhere along the line in much the same way that the first 8 were done. that would be..well..mondo!"
1,Boring Cliched Album.,Generic Ramones album. Nothing remotely different or inspiring about it. Any wonder there are only 3 reviews?? Own 1 Ramomes album and you pretty much own them all.
4,Ramones Return to there true roots!,"After 3 dreadful studio cd's this is more like it. There are many classic tunes here such as ""Poison Heart"",""It's gonna Be Alright"" and ""Touring"" tune sound familiar? This is there best since End of The Century. A must have for any Ramone fan!"
5,a rockin little cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,like most ramone fans back in the day i remember thinking oh man dee dee gone now what was gonna happen to the ramones .the ramones had been pretty much been just going thru the motions thru the late 80s although i still loved 89s brain drain .i was leery of this new bass player cj.but when mondo bizzaro came out it had the name deedee ramone on the song credits so it was nice to see he was still present even though hes not playing on the album.and man the 3 songs or so he added where awsome .all in all its a very good cd with alot to offer well produced .just sucked it went under the radar in the u.s.a .but sold huge in south america.so i say buy it youll be glad you did.we ramones fans only have 14 studio albums to enjoy so be like me and get them all......then you can get there live ones....
4,Solid Reminders For Volatile Market Trading!,"I'm somewhat surprised by the negative reviews on this book. Maybe it's not a perfect interpretation of the Art of War....so what. Maybe there are not a lot of words or text.....you're probably right. And maybe it's not worth [$$$] to some....it's the words on the paper, not the paper.But for an active investor who doesn't need more information but needs to regain their discipline, adaptability, money management, and risk management skills, this can be a very good read.I'm not one to blast other authors or think that there's a lot of money in writing books because it takes a lot of time and effort with little chance of reward to produce these books. But hostile reviewers can be a tremendous disservice.In this case, this book deserves better. You can argue with the packaging, but the message is clearly right on. And in the area of investing and trading, this is what you truly want.I happily spent the money and reread it every year."
2,Disappointed,"Not worth the $19.95. If you have read Sun Tzu's actual book, you can easily decipher the corelation between military strategies and trading. Lundell mainly gives you positive thoughts to inject into your trading mind. The posted 209-page text is very misleading; most pages only have a paragraph or one sentence of ""knowledge"". This book could have been compressed onto a few pages of full-scap."
3,Sun Tsu's Art of War for Traders,"I enjoyed the book, such as it is. I read most of it in the book store standing in line to buy it. It's not a technical ""this is how you do it"" book, it is more of an inspirational, motivational read. Isn't that what philosophy is for anway...?Pick it up for a word of confidence, but not for technicl advice."
1,An insult on Sun Tzu,"The one star goes to the design and packaging of the book. The content of it deserves an even lower rating.I didnt blame the author for his poor translation and interpretation of Sun Tzu's work (As a Chinese who had studied Sun Tzu's Art of War seriously, I am confident that I understand that much more than the majority of non Chinese). What upsets me most is the author's poor market advice/application on every right page of a [strange] Sun Tzu's adage in the Art of War on every left page. First, there was always no relationship between the two. Second, even a veteran trader and trading book fan like me was frequently brought to dont know where by the author's frequent use of very vague words and flamboyant talk.Dont buy it. You can spend your money and time much more productively on other trading books."
4,Well worth the small investment,"I picked this book up in a basement of a London second hand bookshop for 3.95. The reading part only took a few hours, but it's a little gem !. Not only did I get it for a knock down price but, after acting on it's ideas it saved me even more !.Go for it, it may not be a philosophical masterpiece, but it sure helps get the job done."
1,Not A Book For Technical Investors,"I read the book and must say I was also sadly disappointed. The book is written by someone who does not know how to write. I guess that is why there are such few words on every page. I am also a combat veteran of Vietnam, and war has nothing to do with investing. For those interested in learning the technical aspects of investing, and how to get a leg up on the market, this is not your book. Save your money! My guess is the 5 star review is the authors brother or publisher."
1,This is really a ZERO star book.,The best that can be said of this book(?)is that it lacks substance and that it is poorly written.I bought it thinking the author had some insights worthy of sharing.I was sadly mistaken.Don't make the same error.
1,Accusplit AX602 Stopwatch,"I bought this stopwatch for its 3 lines of data, so I wouldn't have to do a bunch of button pushing to retrieve split times. Unfortunately, the right button fails to work about one-third of the time, rendering this stopwatch useless. Sometimes I can click the button multiple times without getting a response on the timer- extremely poor quality."
4,Good product,"I needed a stopwatch that does not make noise each time I click the button.This watch is great and does not make confirmation noise although I cannot turn the noise on either.Seiko S057 has the feature to turn on and off the noise, but it seems the extra features Seiko has do not justify the expensive price $80.Although I think $40 is too much for stopwatch, it probably cheapest one I can find and has the feature I want."
3,Ok stopwatch,When taking splits for a race the last spilt isn't displayed when you stop the race. You need to hit the split and then stop button.
5,Great race watch for crew or swimming,I use this stopwatch to time crew teams at regattas. Easy to use and check split times. Battery lasts a long time. Display is easy to read in the brightest of sunlight. Nice product.
5,cycle,"This is the best recumbant cycle I've used, the quality is second to none! I highly reccommend it!"
5,Three great movies in one box!,Three great westerns from across Clint's career. Clint may have got the Oscar for Unforgiven but Pale Rider is the much better movie in my opinion. The Outlaw Josey Wales fits in somewhere between those two movies. Check them out for yourself and see which you think deserves the award.
3,incomplete set,"Incomplete set, so they put TWO of same movie to complete a three dvd box set. THEY did refund part of moneny but thats not the point."
3,"Excellent Movies, Poor DVD Transfers of 2 out of 3 Movies","We all know Clint Eastwood rocks and is an excellent actor. These movies are, of course, great.DVD quality: The Outlaw Josey Wales is top notch, excellent transfer.Pale Rider & Unforgiven are very poor transfers, and I cannot recommend them in this regular DVD format. Not sure the reason behind this, but the transfers are really blurry and not up to the Outlaw Josey Wales."
1,lousy copy quality,"The outlaw Josey Wales looks OK, but the other movies are copied very poorly. The video is very dark. So dark, most of the time the characters are silhouettes. Don't buy it.David"
5,Outlaw Josey Wales,this is classic Clint Eastwood movie. Nice to have in our collection when we want to watch something that is of better quality than what is on TV.
1,Weird...,"This book has cute photos of real cats dressed and posed with props like fake trees and food. My 3 year old looooves it for the pictures (which don't always go with the story on the corresponding page, or any part of it for that matter) but the story is so odd. Don't buy this book for any sort of educational or artistic value. It might be a good gag gift. We got ours when my grandmother passed away and we found a stash of old children's books... Almost wish we hadn't seen this one..."
3,You can tell they are there....,The fabric is breathable but tends to ride down; sagging at the bottom. The waistband is seamless but the leg opening is sewn making the panty lines extremely visible as they dig into you cheeks. There is an inconsistency in size regarding the looseness of the waistband and the tightness of the leg opening... I will not buy again.
1,Dont like it,I bought these because i have a pair that are the best ever these are horrible they are like nylons so thin so support. Ive been meaning to return them
5,Works as advertised so I'm thrilled,"I love these because they don't retain moisture at all. I'm really sweaty so these are invaluable to me. Life changing, even!I will say though they get kinda linty. I don't put them in the dryer, so maybe if I did that the lint would come off? Don't know and don't care. Love 'em!"
2,Disappointing... waste of a great voice.,"I was so disappointed in this album! I loved her on the show. Gorgeous woman with a gorgeous voice. I thought for sure she would release a Whitney Houston type album full of powerful songs that would do her voice justice. I was wrong. Where is the Latoya from the show? I bought this CD without listening to any samples because I thought for sure I would love it, because she was my favorite contestant that season. I'm happy I bought it to support her, but it has been collecting dust in my CD case for awhile. I listened to it several times initially, hoping it would grow on me, but it just didn't. Two stars because I like Latoya, but this CD was a total letdown."
4,Love all her ballads,"I love all her ballads. They are all good. Clearly she has the voice and all the chops.WIth the slow and jazzy numbers, she is in her elements and at her souldering best. Her smoky voice is defintiely her strength and is showed off best in the ballads.Remove the R&B; numbers and replace with more of the same and this would be a perfect album.Thank goodness I was able to reburn it to make it perfect."
5,Extremely Impressive!!!,"WOW is all I can say... very refreshing to hear REAL MUSIC from an AI contestant!!! I was torn between her and Fantasia... don't get me wrong, I'm glad Fantasia won, but I am even more glad to see that Latoya has a CD out that is well worth the purchase... I reiterate WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE!!! Absolutely DELIGHTFUL!!! She brings back what R&B should be!!!"
4,LONDON ATTACKS WORLD!!!,"Latoya hits em hard with this release! Every track has ""single"" potential. Unlike many recording artist today, Latoya has a pure rich voice and the ability to stylize any type music. In this cd, we have a lot of R&B;, Hip Hop, and little bit of Pop.The ballards are amazing much like the early days of Anita, Phyllis, and Toni Braxton. Don't misunderstand me, LL kicks as@ on APPRECIATE (very infectious beat and lyric!). If this receives enough air play, it could be a huge hit! My favorite cuts on the cd would have to be ANYTHING and EVERY PART OF ME.Honestly folks, this is a good + CD. If you ""appreciate"" good music, this is for you."
2,It's OK !,"It's a nice album,and she shows great talent.The production is quite terrible....Next time she will do and choose better.In the meantime,if you're looking for something really cool,superb,and perfectly performed and produced ,listen to the latest album by the Soul/Jazz superdiva Regina Belle 'Lazy Afternoon'.I think that Latoya should take inspiration from it,as well.She may also find extremely interesting Regina's debut album 'All By Myself'"
3,I love LaToya - What is up with this Album???,"I rushed out to buy this CD cause I'm a HUGE fan of LaToya's voice and performances. But LaToya misses her calling...The whole CD should have been just like ""How I Love the Rain"" and she would have a huge smash and a great niche being a new conveyer of smooth and moody jazz/pop. Instead, most of the tracks sound like really bad R&B. It's not LaToya's fault, they just aren't good songs and they don't highlight her voice. But don't give up on her! She's just about the best there is!"
1,Major disappointment,"I really enjoyed Ms. London on the American Idol show, but this release is a real disappointment. The songs on this Cd do not give justice to her voice. I was surprised considering it was released on a Concord label.Given the right material, Ms. London is great, but this release does not have it. There is too much hip hop r & b and not the serious stuff.I'm hoping the next release will be better."
4,Shes good !!,"Even though I didnt see season 4 AI but I thoughtI take a chance on Latoya since the hype was so highwhen she had got booted off,I said to myself after seeingher on the Ryan Seacrest show hummm she must havebeen very talented.I just got the feeling that I wanted herto push more on some of the songs on her Album,mainlysome of the ballads,Tamyra Gray song the heck out of almostevery last one of her songs on her album,Tamyra Gray isalso playing in the new movie ""The Gospel"" which comesout October 7th,I cant wait.If you do buy this Album it is def worth your moneybecause this woman is great and can really controlher voice and also has awesome tone,a very soothingvoice and she knows how to use it."
4,chaos princess,"Beautiful voice with Beautiful stage presence who could ask for more, should have went further in the competition."
2,It's Aight,"This album is just okay. It was worked on for a while, so I expected a masterpiece. It's not bad but didn't meet my expections. The hip-hoppish songs don't work for Latoya at all. However, the ballads work out well. I just don't know about it :-/"
1,She lost for a reason,She has the pipes......The attitude was her downfall. If she were a bit humble she might have made the top 2. America likes to watch the Humbled! Period nothing else to say!!
5,Wonderful Surprise,"I obtained this CD a few months ago and absolutely fell in love with it. I am a huge music lover and this album remains to be one of my favorite so much so I decided to purchase to support the artist. The songs are truly timeless and I'll recommend it to lovers of just plain old good music. Come home, pour a glass of wine, put your feet up and relax listening to the sounds of Love & Life. I can open pray that she's working on something more, she has won me over."
3,Impressive debut for Latoya,"I was listening to some fine tracks on a recent flight and was pleasantly surprised to hear they were sung by Latoya. Very nice, smooth sound, she can fit well into the R&B, soul or even light jazz categories. Whether you think she should have won American Idol or not, there's no doubt she left the show too early and deserves a full publicity push for this very good record."
4,Beautiful,I didn't really watch AI 2004 so I wasn't familiar with LaToya London. I just happened upon it while browsing Itunes one day. I stayed late at work to finish downloading the album. It's that good. I love that it's just pure singing. Beautiful singing. It's not over produced like so much out there now. If you like pure vocals you should buy this album you will not be sorry.
5,Country Swing Vol. 1 - Karaoke CDG Songlist:,Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1. Baby Likes To Rock It - The Tractors2. Oklahoma Swing - Reba McEntire & Vince Gill3. Cotton Eye Joe - The Rednex4. Fast As You - Dwight Yoakam5. Neon Moon - Brooks & Dunn6. T-R-O-U-B-L-E - Travis Tritt7. Watermelon Crawl - Tracy Byrd8. San Antonio Stroll - Tanya Tucker
3,Ok movies,Both these movies were ok but not my cup of tea. The price was right and I thought I would give them a try.
3,Delightful potboiler,"It's cheesy and breezy and a great summer read. I'd be very surprised if the film rights weren't optioned before publication. I couldn't get the images of Orlando Bloom and Penelope Cruz out of my head while reading it (not necessarily a bad thing). This book contains everything you could ask for in a swashbuckling romance, but it isn't lowbrow at all. It contains thoughtful thematic material on the nature of love, desire, fidelity, and faith. The plot doesn't drag at all, filled as it is with narrow escapes, chases, and assorted derring-do, seasoned with enough costume-drama detail to satisfy dedicated readers of historical fiction. The Grand Inquisitor is an exquisite villain and great counterpoint to the other religious figures who display varying levels of sanctity and sin. OK, so the prose dips toward the purple at times, but it's forgivable given the conceit that it's the ""lost"" diary of Don Juan. This book is tasty mind candy. Indulge yourself."
4,"Very good solid read for ""lovers"" of historical fiction","For anyone interested in the infamous Don Juan, or historical fiction in general, this novel is a good solid read. While at times the seduction of Sevilla's women gets slightly repetitive, you are bound to be swept away by the honest passion of the lovers, the romantic city, or the uncertainty and mystery of the age in which Don Juan may have lived. Running across Sevillian rooftops in a black mask to escape jealous husbands and fathers, masquerading at balls, associating intimately with nuns and prostitutes, while doing everything in his power to evade the Inquisitioner, Don Juan certainly has the reader entertained from page one. However, the most turbulent dilemma he faces at the heart of this novel is whether he can in fact ever love one woman....and you'll have to read through to the end to find out!"
4,Very fine selections from classical literature,"These books could be characterized as a Reader's Digest of classical literature. Actually, it is better than that. The selections are clearly made with great care. The books provide material from some authors who are virtually impossible to find except in huge libraries."
3,NOt playboy,YOu have girls who have massive ugly strech marks dancing on this video.One girl is even lactating from her nipples as though she just had a baby.All the girls are either black or latina. The one latina that is the hottestseems to have a tattoo of the name of all the guys she has ever slept withI guess. And it appears as though it was filmed in a cheap Los Angeles motel room
4,decent costume,"Pros: Made of durable fabric which is woven 100% cotton, not that cheap knit stuff that picks up so easily. Could be altered because it is woven fabric. Top and skirt are separate, which allows it to fit person of almost any height. Hems are actually folded and stitched down.Cons: When washed and dried, it shrank as you would expect 100% to shrink, which was A LOT. When I took it out of the bag, one of the ties at the back of neck fell off. After trying it on, one of the buttons fell off. It was supposed to come with two hair bows, but package only contained one. The blue color of the fabric is not the same as the blue color of the ric-rac trim. The waist is pretty small on this thing!Overall: This costume will shrink, and some parts may need to be resown, but it will last for years. I am very pleased with the fact that it is not that cheap stretchy knit fabric with raw-cut edges that have simply been serged over. Glad I bought it."
2,its ok....,well i ordered this Dorothy costume in a large and i am a size 12 dress size and it did not fit... i contacted the seller and they told me i was aloud to send it back... so i ordered a x-large and this one fit but i was not comfortable in this costume and ended up wearing a different one. waste of my money because it had to be returned within a week of ordering it and it was too late...plus they charge you a restocking fee if you want your money back.
2,Proof anyone can get a book published,"Although there is SOME good information in this book, I have 5 things in the first chapter alone marked in red letters ""wrong."" As a parent of three children on the spectrum, a speaker on the subject, an education advocate with a national certification, and a person with common sense, I found too many mistakes in this book to recommend it. I try to keep up on what is out there because I talk to parents regularly who have just received their diagnosis. I will loan out this one, because the corrections are in it. As I said, it does have some good parts, but it is scary if parents, and other people, are reading this and only this and taking it as accurate."
4,One of my best Pfaltzfraff items,This has probably been one of the best pfaltzgraff items I have bought. I use it for a lot of things and have never had any issues with the enamel chiping like a lot of my other purchases. My handle came off one time but it simply screwed back on with no problems. It has been very easy to clean and durable.
4,"Early, Good, More Mellow","This is Keiko's second release. I find it to be a little more mellow than some of her other CDs. It is a Keiko product and thus better than CDs by most artists, but I hesitantly place it in the lower half of her CDs. If you are addicted to her music like I am, then you should definitely buy it because it is really very good. If you are only exploring her music, then buy ""The Keiko Matsui Collection"". Half of the songs on that CD are from ""Under Northern Lights"", and ""Collection"" contains the best songs from ""N. Lights""."
5,I love Keiko,Another good CD to listen to music from Keiko. I would buy it again.I've read in other comments about Keiko's albums that some of the songs are repeated; when that happens it's like having the same great plate but with a different flavor -because she does add/change something- which I always welcome and enjoy. Recommended.
4,Beachbuggy - real garage rock!,"Literally, this cd is full of garage rock - the songs are all 3-chord anthems to speed and hot rods. Beachbuggy slams thru some good old fashioned rock and has fun doing it. Think Death Race 2000 with a Ramones soundtrack."
4,"Evocative, relaxing music",I was introduced to the artist by a friend living in Santa Monica. I walked in her living room and heard the music and instantly had to know who it was (I had not heard of him). I now own three CDs and his music is evocative of other wondrous places far away from North America. It's relaxing and enervating and soothes the soul.
3,CB4 is better as a movie,"The cd does not have all of the songs i wanted, it only had the 'sweat of my balls', 'straight outta locash' and 'rappers delight'. In the rappers delight wacky dee did preform. i was hoping to see move of him on the cd. You will not understand this cd at all unless you have seen the movie. I reccomend the movie very very much."
3,Funny parodies but not much else,"This cd has some funny parodies but personally beyond those 2 songs (and the one remix of Rappers Delight) I cant really recommend it. Probably just because I havent seen the movie. But I am surprised this CD is still in print apparently, not to trash it but, its been over 10 years, most soundtracks dont last that long."
3,Was Great Value-- Except Came with Large deep Scratch,"Backboard was great value for the money -- except it came with a very large and fairly deep scratch. At first thought it was white paint -- but could feel ridge with fingernail. Rather than to ""mess"" with return -- I purchased special product to polish-out. Not counting time to chase down and purchase polishing product-- it took a couple of hours to polish-out the scratch by hand."
4,Leaves me wanting more...,"I'm a big fan of the show (or at least the first 3 seasons), and finally bought the CD as I really enjoy the music. I gave the CD a quick listen and thought it 'OK', but now that I've had some free time to really relax and listen to it, I find I enjoy it much more than I originally thought. Many times I find soundtracks are great when accompaying the action onscreen (setting the mood), but come up lacking when they must stand alone. I'd say roughly 3/4 of the music on this CD can stand alone. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I'd like to hear more!Some here have stated some music from the show is missing, and if so, I hope the authors include it on a later CD as promised?If you like relaxing music, some with a bit of Celtic flavor, you need to make time to give this one a listen.BTW, my favorite track on the CD is The Secret of Strandhill/Redemption (track 2)."
5,chinese styled,"i like the music very much, and i think it is quite chinese styled. anybody agree here? just because the main instrument in the main title is alto fiddle, a traditional chinese ancient instrument. they mixed it with others perfectly.great!!"
5,Totally addictive...,"I just received the CD in the mail and I am playing it for the third time now, I just can't stop listening to it! (though it's almost midnight...)This music is so relaxing and it totally soothes a stressful mind, I love it. Whenever you feel like hearing some out-of-the-ordinary music, or reliving those typical Taelon moments, buy this CD! You won't regret it!"
3,Disappointing,"I am disappointed by the CD because there are not all of the 1st and 2nd season musics and more over the missing musics are the ones that I was expecting of such as ""live free or die"" or ""the wrath of achilles""... well I give 3 stars because I am a fan."
3,OK...,"New age and soundtracks are funny things. Sometimes it's good sometimes it's strange and sometime it's bad.This one ended right in the middle, and does very well on the whole.Unfortuantly, some of the songs are just horrible but that can be easily ignored... by just skipping the track. All in all a sound buy if u enjoy the show or are interested in new age"
2,Recycled Windham Hill circa 1985,"After reading other reviews on this cd I thought I'd give it a try.Well the other reviwers were I think more mainstream music fans whereas I prefer wierder more challenging listening.I found this cd rather boring and way too mellow for my tastes.this is not nearly as good the recent Farscape,Bladerunner,or Tales from a parallel universe,all of which I found much more enjoyable."
4,"decent condition, amazing information","Needed this book for nursing school. The book itself was in decent condition, but the information in it was extraordinary."
2,contents,I ordered a package that included the book and psychnotes. I only got the book and it was outside of the shrinkwrapped package. the package as there it was just loose. didn't make sense to me unless the person who packaged it was lazy. I am a little mad that I didn't the whole package that I paid for.
4,Not much new here,"If you have read about the attempts on Hitlers life you would find nothing new in this book. One interesting fact reported herein was that Georg Elsner, who attempted to blow up Hitler at one of his yearly speaches at the Burgerbraukeller in Munich, was honored in his hometown with a monument dedicated in 1998---more than 50 years after his death. It seems like the Germans really never appreciated how brave he was."
2,Take a leap of faith with this one!,"A wild fantasy of what would have happened if the world knew that Elvis' twin Jesse Garon had really survived! This is wild and crazy and can hit some subjects a little closer to home than some may care to see. It's just fun, but if you get your feelings hurt when bad things are said about Elvis, steer clear! I enjoyed it and recommend it to Elvis fans with a sense of humor!"
2,c'est bien fait mais c'est du gachi,"il y a des gens qui meurent de faim, et il y a des characteres qui n'ont rien mieux a faire que de fabriquer des cochonneries comme cette-ci"
5,Gives important insights as to why reading failure occurs.,"What is new/important here? This book revisits the problem of the ""fourth-grade slump"" in reading achievement. This lack of success with the more complex reading demands of the later elementry years is usually overcome by children whose homes provide encouragement, enrichment, and homework assistance. Poorer children usually do not recieve these benefits and fall furthur behind each year. What can be done? The authors suggest that schools pay chose attention to the changing instructional requirements in the late elementry years and provide all students with specific assistance to insure their transition into more complex reading. Close monitoring of each student's progress helps identify students needing extra assistance. The authors feel optimistic in the school program's ability to overcome these problems, but admit that they may be costly. But how can we as a society affort to not teach children to read?"
3,nice mellow music.,The artist has a nice mellow style and it was cheap :-). I need more happy music to listen to. Feel good music for a summer day.
3,Heavy reading,"I read this for my book club, and it was tough to get through. The author is obviously very intelligent and inventive. Perhaps other people like him would enjoy it more than I did."
5,Awesome,I have had this Necklace for a long time now. Several years and it is holding up very well so far.
2,Wrong Size,"I purchased this chain to go along with the cross pennant I was buying. I thought it would fit because I read that people who bought the pennant also bought that chain. In reality, the pennant didn't fit on the chain."
3,"Good ""starter"" set...","This is a good starter set, but if you cook very much I'd go with a higher quality set. When we received this set one pan was uneven and would gently rock back and forth when boiling water (we have a flat ceramic stove top; maybe it doesn't do this on a conventional stove). I use wooden utensils when cooking, hand wash them with a sponge, and let them air dry. However, even with this care the nonstick coating still comes off more than I would have expected. The pans are of a decent weight...not too heavy, not too flimsy. The glass lids are nice (but they do make a popping sound as food is cooking), and the built in strainers are very handy for straining vegetables and large pasta. For the money, they're a great deal, but if you cook much or are wanting a set to last a long time I'd suggest a higher quality brand. I'm going to try this set:Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 10-Piece Cookware SetIt got great reviews in Cook's Illustrated."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this set to replace a set of T-Fal pots/pans I've had for years where the non-stick surface has scraped off from use. But the handles are metal which means they get hot when something is cooking. I don't like using pot holders (too cumbersome), so I plan on returning this set. Very disappointing, otherwise this set seems like a great value."
3,Love the functionality but not very sturdy.,I love these pots and pans for the drain lids but the lid handles tend to come off and are not repairable. Easy to clean and attractive.
4,Not for smooth top stoves,I haven't yet pruchased these but have noticed many reviews mention warping and flaking of non-stick surface or pot. In those reviews they often mention a smooth-top stove. In researching my purchase I have noticed that these are NOT recommended for smooth-top stoves. Many reviewers semmed unaware of this when purchasing.
1,Worst Ever,"Upon first use, the pan's outer coating melted onto my cooktop. It took hours with the help of my daughter to clean it off of my cooktop. The pan seemed warped after only 1 use as it rocked a little on my flat cooktop.I read the instructions and there was no warning or anything that this might happen.It belongs in a dollar store at best. Horrible experience with Farberware. AVOID."
4,Gangs of London,"The best part of the game is the story line. To add, the introduction before every mission is very captivating. This alone keeps you wanting to beat every mission and go on to another one. I however expected more blood and actually thought heads would fall off or at least be able to have head shots and see the blood spray out. However, all in all, its a good game."
3,Ok,This game is ok if you want a cheap portable Driver3 game. It is kinda fun to drive around London but if you get in trouble the cops will never stop chasing you. The graphics are lame to.
3,Eeehhh......,"This game had a lot of potential of being a great game.Made by the people that brought the Getaway to the Playstation 2 (which was a great game),but they kinda dropped the ball here.I just cant get into the game.I wouldntve bought it for $4.00 + shipping if I had known what the gameplay was like or lacked.Maybe worth $1.50.Not really impressed with it at all."
1,not as good as I thought it would be,This game was not fun for me at all!!!!! This game is cartoonish and the graphics suck. The only thing good about this game is the gang battles and after awhile that gets boring also. I downloaded this game of the playstation network for $12.99 and it was not worth it.
1,WASTE OF YOUR F#$%&ing MONEY,"This game really sucks! First of all the graphics are friggin horrible, it's like watching blurred t.v. Second freeplay really sucks you can't kill any civilians and if you slightly tap a cop car they start chasing you. This game is like my title a waste of money."
3,At least half size bigger,I got this pair when it was on sale for $15. The size is at least half size bigger than the real size should be. And very wide. The heel is really high. Not comfortable at all. The quality is not as good as the price shows. It just worth $15.
1,Love getting broken shipments that I paid for................NOT,"Well I really know this product is good, and I also require it for the lens I bought, but it came broken with the lens cleaning liquid everywhere so I cant even use the brush. What I got from the kit that can be used is the dust blower and the cleaning cloth, both great items to attain with a lens. The pen is the real deal though, it basically should be the only reason why anyone would want to buy the kit.What made me mad was I tried to cancel the order a couple of times because it had not shipped, so i thought. After three emails asking for the cancel notification with no response I had it. The information said it had not shipped yet, but finally after a week I got feed back telling me it did. The main reason I wanted to cancel the order is because I found this item at local store for the same price without the shipping wait. Came broken in the end, real cool."
5,How Faith Works,"This is a great bible study series for a small group. I led it for a group ranging from 10-15 people. Each Sunday we took a lesson a discovered the ""life lesson"" that the book of James holds for us. After reading it and going over the questions in each session, you can't help but make changes in your life, or see the possiblity for change and growth."
2,Very Basic...Milk not Meat,"I purchased this book because I was doing a Bible study on James with a friend. I have enjoyed reading Lucado's other books. They are often thought provoking and challenging. However, I did not find this book to be of the same caliber. It is extremely basic and doesn't have much meat. In my opinion this would be good as an introduction for a very new Christian, but for any other believer, it falls short of getting to the heart of what James wrote. So, if you want something very (I mean very) basic, then this is for you. If you want to dig deeper (I don't mean into the Greek) to get some meat (and get off the milk), then try something else."
2,Weak material,I agree with the other reviewer that this book is weak for the purpose of leading a small group or Sunday School class. The study questions do not dig deeply into the scripture passages.
3,For Collectors Only,"There's a reason why the films in this collection aren't well-known: they offer only occasional glimpses of Keaton's genius.Hard-core Keaton fans may enjoy this vey much (though I liked Kino's ""extras"" disc much more than this). There's a copy of ""The Playhouse"" that while it looks better than the Kino version is a duplication of what's already avasilable. There are two features (talkies) that are no better than average. The commercials are interesting curios, and the industrial films range from OK to poor. But casual fans would be much better off buying ANY silent Keaton (or Arbuckle) DVD (or even ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"") than this collection."
1,Scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.,"If you've seen everything that Keaton has ever done and you're excited about this new release, don't be. Many of the snippets have been seen before on other, more professionally produced DVD collections and with much of the content being from Keaton's later career, it's sad (and boring!) to watch him reduce himself to some of the work collected here. Seems this is a greedy attempt to make some money from bits and pieces scraped together and Keaton's name is exploited to do it. Do yourself a favor and watch Keaton at his best. There are many DVD collections that showcase this brilliant man and this is certainly NOT one of them.Don't waste your money or your time. Very disappointing!"
4,A Fine Addition ot nay Keaton Collection,"If you rate your DVD's by the amount of times that you have watched it then this would be right up there for me. There is some excellent material on this DVD I really enjoyed the short movie called ""The Homeowner"". I found all the commentary to be excellent also. Plus it is a chance to see some quite rare Keaton TV Footage. This is a fine addition to any Keaton Collection."
3,good music from films you haven't seen,"Christopher Franke is perhaps best known for his work with Tanegrine Dream, or perhaps for scoring the television series Babylon 5. This CD features more of his synthesizer oriented music, and if you listen closely you can probably detect the Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra, which he founded. There are selections from some of his more recent works: Tarzan and the Lost City, Solo, The Inheritance, Terror in the Mall, and Pacific Blue, with the songs ordered to provide the best listening experience instead of being grouped by project. My problem with this CD is that I haven't seen any of these films, so none of these songs resonate very much for me."
4,You have to love it...,Shai came hard with this album. The beats are relaxing and the vocals are hot. I thought that they would be large by now but that's the music business.Go put this one in your R&B collection for a rainy night...
5,BACK IN THE DAY.,BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE BUT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW I WISH I WAS A KID AGAIN.
4,Does a mostly good job,"I really like the Mr Coffee Simply Brew. I have had mine for over a year and use it most every day. I chose it because it had the feature to use your own coffee. The trick I have found it to use course ground coffee.At first I was very disappointed when I found the pods to make light brown water (very weak coffee) and regular ground coffee to come out sludge (from all the residue). For a while I used a paper filter and was very pleased with the result but there was an extra step (I know lazy but I bought this because it was supposed to be ""simple""). Anyway, once I started to use course ground coffee everything has been great. I get good, hot, coffee every time. Now I can say that I love this coffee maker.You can get course ground coffee using the coffee grinder at your grocery store."
4,"""It's pretty cool!""","I bought this single-serve coffee maker for my wife and when I told her Amazon wanted a review she said, ""It's pretty cool!"" So there you have it.She has also mentioned in the past that she really likes that it takes both pods and grounds. My favorite feature is that the spigot can be raised and lowered very easily to fit the cup (I don't drink the coffee, but I do occasionally maker her a cup).So it is versatile, easy to use and makes good coffee. What more do you need?"
1,"""joke""","This appliance is a ""cruel"" hoax masquerading as a pod coffee maker. I could not believe how terrible the coffee tasted that was brewed from this ""hoax"" appliance. I would not recommend this machine except to my worst enemy."
2,Cheap coffee maker,"I had a feeling it might conk out eventually as soon as I received it. It did make a good cup of coffee, but it ""died"" yesterday after about 3 months. It is poorly made and obviously not made to last long."
1,Weak coffe,"No matter what I've tried, the coffee from this machine comes out too weak. I haven't tried the ground coffee holder yet, but the purpose of buying this was to use pods I had already bought. I'm very disappointed in this machine. It was a waste of money."
1,2cup single coffee maker by Mr. Coffee,"This coffee maker makes very weak coffee,grounds seep into cups,no reservoir for water and very slow to make a cup of coffee."
1,The quality was left out.,I bought this brewer because it can brew a 14oz mug of coffee. What I get is a 14oz mug of coffee flavored hot water.
1,weaker than water when you use a pod (or even 2!),"This product is the worst pod maker I have EVER used. With my senseo pod maker I used one mug worth of water and one pod. It made the best cup of coffee. When I do the same thing with this maker, it is WEAK. I tried using one mug of water to 2 pods and it is just as weak. It is TERRIBLE as pod maker. I do like the coffee it makes with the ground coffee and filter basket thingy."
3,Different not necessarily better,"I was excited about this product when I first used it. It has a pump that actually pumps the hot water through the coffee. I was hoping for a semi espresso effect. However, it pumps too fast at too low a pressure for a single serving to get good extraction and the coffee comes out a bit thin. I find myself stopping it part way through (just by pushing the ON button again) and letting the coffee grounds ""brew"" to get a richer flavor. 2 Cups work much better.They should have a switch for 1 or two cups to allow for a slower pump time.It is probably a good 2 pod coffee maker but I have only tested it extensively with ground home roasted beans."
2,Trying to get rid of this thing,"Tried several batches with the single pod (to save money on the pricey pods)... really weak coffee. Tried several batches with the dual pod holder... still pretty weak. The only batch of coffee that would taste half-way decent was using the ground coffee holder... and the coffee would end up with a lot of coffee grounds and muddy cup bottoms.Sure, the concept of a single, quick cup of coffee was alluring, but we've set this $50 model aside in favor of our good ole $10 standard coffee maker.... which still makes good coffee.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it does have the option of brewing with 1 or 2 pods or loose grounds. Also, the dispenser moves up and down to accomodate mugs of various heights while eliminating splatter... pretty cool feature actually.This European concept of pressure-brewed coffee is probably a fine, theoretical concept, but this coffee maker does a terrible job in applying that concept. You have been warned."
4,Beautifully Written,"I never would have imagined the plight of the imigrant woman had it not been for this book.Nina's story, among other women were compelling.I would strongly recommend this book it is not only informative, but also emotionally engaging, and gives a good discription on the issues immigrant women face with here in the United States, mainly discrimination."
3,"Wheat, chaff, wheat , chaff... chaff...","Again, with apologies to the band, I have to admit that this was NOT one of the Tzadik releases that ended up impressing me. There are some interesting soundscapes, it's sort of technodubfunkrock stuff, club music taken just a little outside the usual parameters -- but after two listenings I sold it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't have a particular reason to be interested (people obsessive about Japanese/New York club music, for example). By the way, the bands name is inconveniently represented by a phonetic alphabet neither Amazon nor myself can type, but is pronounced more like ""dosage,"" methinks."
1,"E-model, dumbass","It is a really neat model, except that it is outfitted with the Pratt&Whitney TF33, which belong to the KC135E. My boss had one, and it was durable and fancy. however, this one is wrongfully labeled."
5,"Hits From ""Grease"" - Karaoke CDG Songlist:","Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1. Hopelessly Devoted To You - Olivia Newton-John2. Greased Lightning - John Travolta3. Born To Hand Jive - Sha-Na-Na4. Grease - Frankie Valli5. Summer Nights - Olivia Newton-John & John Travolta6. Beauty School Dropout - Frankie Avalon7. Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee - Stockard Channing8. You're The One That I Want - Olivia Newton-John & John Travolta"
3,Some forward insight mixed with backward mentality,"Starts off well before degenerating into archaic sentiments on women (get back inside!) and education (needs moar god!). If you could buy just the first section, do that."
4,A classic...,That's all I can say right now... It's a classic which almost everybody interested in economics should read to have a different point of view...
4,Bring it back,"The way Barbara Cook sings ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" has changed my sense of that song forever. She takes what I always thought was a corny fairy tale melody and turns it into a heart wrenching aria worthy of Puccini. I am desperate to have this CD for my children to enjoy. Bring it back!"
2,An early book,"Connie Brockway is a wonderful author, known for her humor and strong characters--both main and secondary. This is her only Western, and apparently a very early work. It has a very strong beginning and the dialogue among the two Native Americans are worth the download price. However, since this is a re-issue, it would benefit from a rewrite, toning down the accented dialogue, and more attention to developing how a hardworking Irish immigrant becomes a gunslinger with a Western accent."
2,Lacks intensity and conflict. Disappointing.,"The story started off just fine. However, for two very promising characters, both the hero and heroine needed some serious challenges--like dealing with some real issues like alcoholism or post-war trauma. Sadly, there was only a vague reference of Noble working for environment protection."
4,Fun read,"Another fun mystery featuring Midnight Louis, cat detective extraordinaire, and Temple Barr, the spunky public relations pro with a knack for stumbling into murder cases."
3,Good but...,fabric is nice and soft but it does not give as much support as theSnuzzler Complete Head And Body Support For Any Seat - Pink Trimmy recommendation is to go with the SNUZZLER
2,Great- for a week,"I bought this car seat insert because my little girl was too small for her car seat (she came home at 5lbs 7 oz). The first few times I used this, she was fine- her head was snugly supported in the headrest. A week later, she began lifting her head out of the support and slumping forward (at this point she was approximately 6 lbs). I tried many times to adjust the headrest and the entire support system but I was unsuccessful so I took it out and put the original headrest from the car seat back inside."
3,Not as supportive as it looks,"The side supports are great but the head support is too flat and wide to give adequate support to a newborn's head in a car seat. Traditional head support products that come with two adjustable head support cushions are much more practical and provide much better support. This product is beautiful and very soft but comes short when it comes to performance. Also, be aware that if you delivered your baby at a U.S. Army hospital, they will not allow you to have this product in your car seat when you take your baby home as this product does not comply with safety regulations observed by the military. We ended up using this product in our daughter's baby swing when she was 2 months old and it was useful."
3,not what I expected,"I purchased this product based off the pics in the add hoping for great head support for my infant. It appeared to me that the padding on the head pillow came up around the baby's head more. I have found the pillow to be quite shallow and doesn't come up around the baby's head at all. The middle part with the side support turned out to be more that I was expecting. It definitely snugs around the baby. If the head support worked as well as the sides, this would be a five star for sure."
4,love it,I couldn't find the pink color anywhere at the store..glad I found it here on Amazon! Shipping was fast and the quality of the product is great...my newborn baby is very comfy in it!
4,body support,Th shipment came rather quickly. I put it in the car seat but the little one hasnt yet arrived so I dont know how well it works quite yet but I do like how versatile it is being able to be moved from car seat to stroller with ease.
2,Boring!!!!,"I never write a review, but I had to for this book. This book was so boring I just started flipping through the pages just to get to the end of the story. Where was the romance???? This book is not a romance book, the charaters had more problems and hang-up then I do... I do not want to read a romance story when the character points out the man had an over-bite. . .whatever. I think this was book was written, just to get another copy on the shelf...and the publishers should be ashame of themselves for allowing this book to be published."
2,Boring,"I did not particularly enjoy this book. The plot was not so much slow as it was uneventful. The author spent too much page space on other characters and their story. I felt this time could have been better spent on developing the lead characters better. Overall, this story lacked action. It was very uneventfully and stoid."
4,Dead Jammin',Moment to moment the book was pretty good. I think altogether the book would of held up better had the writer more time to flesh things out. Read like a rough draft of something great. Collaborations are tough and I tend to favor the single creator's like Daniel Clowes. Largely I'm giving it four stars for the art and the humor. Williams did a stellar job.
1,Beware,"Too excited at finding a CD with 'Murderer' on it (can't find it anywhere), I unfortunately didn't spot that this is a Sly and Robbie mix of Barrington Levy's originals. Desperately disappointing. The only thing murdered are Barrington Levy's songs. Don't make the same mistake!"
2,Simply boring,"Ok,I know these are low budget movies and the main interest is seeing Lana Clarkson nude so I keep forwarding the disc until I had some skin scenes.I must say the torture rack scene in Barbarian Queen is quite good fact that doesn't occour in the sequel.Poor acting and dialogue,bad staged sword fights,lots of extras and awful clothing.A set of flicks to see with your friends on a boring and rainy Friday night."
3,Good but not brilliant.,"This is an interesting book, and goes a long way into giving information on the Roman army and the Praetorian Guard. Its section on the Praetorian Guard is particularly good, but the standard work for the army in general is still Parker's Roman Army. This book does not quite measure up to that. However it is a very good read and well worth the investment if you are interested in the Roman Army."
4,Nice helmet,"I boguht this for my SAR kit and it appears to be a nice helmet - luckily I haven;t had to test its impact resistance yet! I do use this when hiding in large rubble piles for live find dogs and have bumped my head on rocks - the helmet has saved me from some minor bumps on the melon ona few occasions.This however is not a top of the line model and the fit is not all that comfortable - it's interior is hard very hard. The buckle is a bit of a bugged to undo when you;re wearing the helmet - hard to find the release.Other than that great buy for the person who wouls use it from time to time -- maybe not so much for the die hard rock climber, etc...JMHO"
2,Keep looking.,"I am not happy with this purchase at all. I knew I was buying a relatively cheap TV but didn't expect it to be this cheap. The sound quality is terrible. It takes about 10 seconds to actually power on after you press the ""on"" button. The remote is not easy at all. You can't ""surf"" up and down - you have to manually press the channel you want AND if it is #10 or higher you have to press ""100"" then the channel number. I am told there is a way to eliminate this process but I have yet to figure it out. There is also a glow on the top and bottom of the picture. There's got to be a better TV than this for cheap money. If I thought Circuit City would refund me the money I'd return it in a heartbeat but it looks like to stopped carrying it. Too many complaints?"
5,Sound choice has the BEST Quality karaoke tracks in my opinion!!!,"This listing is for a brand new Sound Choice Star Series Dance Hits Vol.2 CDG (SC2108).This top of the line CD comes sealed in a heavy plastic jewel case, plays the music without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G; player. This is a Multiplex CD which has the 8 songs without vocals as well as the same 8 songs with guide vocals to help the singer learn the song before singing it in public. These songs are not preformed by the original artists but they are probably the BEST re-creations available.Sound Choice Star Series Specialty KaraokeDance Hits Vol.2 - 2108Stereo Performance/Vocal Tracks1.

Macarena - Los Del Rio7. Cool Jerk - The Capitols8. Walk Like An Egyptian - Bangles"
2,Meh...,"It's not quite what I was hoping for, but isn't too bad. Some pictures would've been helpful before purchase so I would've known what to expect. Then again, if there had been pictures, I probably would've went with something that cost a little more just to get closer to what I wanted."
5,GEORGE MICHAEL,"I HADN'T ACTUALLY EVER HEARD OF GEORGE MICHAEL UNTIL THE SERIES ABOUT ELI STONE. REALLY LIKE HIS VOICE. THIS PURCHASE WAS MUCH MORE THAT I HAD EXPECTED. IT WAS A VISUALLY HISTORY OF HIS MUSIC FROM MUCH EARLIER IN HIS LIFE UNTIL CURRENT. IT WAS REALLY GOOD, A LITTLE WEIRD IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE OLDER PERFORMANCE THAT I AM USED TO. VERY GOOD ALBUM. VERY INTERESTING."
5,Awesome DVD!,"I've been a George Michael fan for 20 years and still love hearing WHAM'searly hits...""Everything She Wants"" and ""Careless Whisper."" And who can forget ""Faith"" and ""Father Figure""? This double DVD includes those songs as well as ones that were kinda forgetten once MTV and VHI went REALITY. ""Jesus To A Child"" is my favorite video with George at his best...as well as ""Flawless (Go To The City)"", ""Older"", You Have Been Loved"", and ""Round Here"" from his last album. It's so worth the $. Enjoy!"
5,big ego deserved,"Despite his admittedly large ego, George has undeniable talent and if only America would play his music as they used to years ago. He still makes great songs."
5,George Michael 25,I love this DVD! Finally I was able to watch all those GM's videos from the 80s! Great!
4,about twenty-five...............,"Singapore is selling this copy with the unavailable of two songs freek and outside, that's all which was sold in Singapore shops at Sembawang video/cd shops etc. The lucky point of this video is that the careless whisper for this solo gig pass the M18 rating while the version found in the best of george michael did not pass ratings at all (which they regard the video clip as R21 ratings), videoclip outside was regarded as R21 due to homosexual themes). That's all.TwentyFiveN/B: One thing bad about videoclip outside is that which country record this video clip will represent the country to have this sex problem, hae hae..Review by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector lou Ye for film summer palace."
3,Repeated material,"As the other customer clarify it, most of the material in this dvd was previously issued on the DVD Ladies & Gentlemen compilation, so there not much new here. I think it is time for the George and his record company to put out a entire live concert dvd, with all his songs. For an artist that has retired several times from the bussiness it is strange that such a concert is still not available. If you are a new fan of George Michael and do not have a dvd of his songs, then go ahead and buy this one."
1,Amazon sent me a dud,"I ordered this from the company and I got a Chinese copy that didn't work right (a partial loop of ""Faith""). I'll write back with substance if I can get a new copy."
1,Save your hard earned money,"Stay away from this movie. Keep a distance of 100 yards or greater at all times. This movie is a total piece of somethin. Terrible voice overs, ghetto 80's art, dumb plot. Go buy a value meal or something instead."
1,Look out!,"This review is another warning for people who for some reason or another may feel some sort of an inclination to purchase this video. If you enjoy the video game at all then leave this movie be it will disappoint you in every possible way. My only gripe is that I bought it when if first game out so I paid a lot more for this movie, which I painfully regret even to this day."
3,"Samurai Shodown"" Game or Movie?""","I have the movie and I agree with both reviewers that there are some bad elements of the movie. I was not too impressed about the battle scenes. I was hoping to have more sequences of the bad guys and the goods guys with all the characters in the movie. Instead they restricted most of the power abilities they could have shown in the movie. If they have took the effort to make a great movie, there would have made enough money to make a trilogy. Within the story line of the games, there was a whole lot more going on in the story then what they showed in the movie. I own the movie and regardless of its aweful film, I bought it because its my favourite game. I am glad another Samurai Shodown game cam out onto the Playstation 2. I was so upset about SNK disapearing forever..(Really the person who made this movie should realize that its a Japanese game, so it should've been spelled correctly. SAMURAI SHODOWN NO ""W"")Thanks for reading my review."
1,complete garbage,"This is more of a warning than a review. Some may be tempted by this title's low price. Others may consider buying it because they are fans of the popular video game series it is based on. I warn you all not to be tempted. The voice acting in the dubbed version is some of the worst that I have ever heard. It is not only poorly done but sometimes entirely nonsensical (macho fighter characters with girly voices..etc). The dialogue is silly, insipid and often incoherent. The plot is at best weak. Characters wander in and out and the story wanders back and forth. The animation is the best aspect of this title and it is merely average or a bit below. In short, this title is atrocious. If you want swords and sorcery action, buy Ninja Scroll and pass on this dog."
1,ugh,"To put it simply, this is a bad, bad movie, an example of what happens when you try to make a video game into a movie. The animation is badly done, the voice acting sub-par --the voices don't even match the characters very well -- and the frequent action sequences are retro to the extreme and just don't look good.... I'm sorry to everyone who liked this film, but I love all anime, and I couldn't get halfway through this one. Avoid this movie at all costs."
1,AD Vision presents: Matt Greenfield as Earthquake!,"I have no idea why AD Vision decided to make this their first dubbed release, but all I can say is that, uh, Shiro Tokisada Amakusa (the bad guy with the makeup)is MALE. Talk about not knowing a production's storyline. Good thing AD Vision released Dirty Pair, otherwise I might not have forgiven them for this...."
1,If you have sold a house or bought one forget this book!,I was really looking forward to this read - however greatly unsatisfied when I finished (within an hour). Most of what is inside would be common sense for anyone who has sold or bought a house in the past using a good agent. This is not to say that I like using an agent - I don't and won't. What I do mean is that if you have had past experience with this kind of transaction and had a good agent that walks you through the process than you have already covered much of the content of this book- like home inspections and appraisals and oh ya duh get a good lawyer. Save your money for the lawyer and your ads!
4,Where's the Bonus?,"Great book! Only negative remark I have is the fact that I bought this book based on the understanding (as advertised on Amazon) that an e-mail address would be provided to obtain all the documents covered. However, I have yet to discover this ""secret"" e-mail address!"

1,"Save your money, get something else.","This toilet seat is a total piece of trash. After only a month of use, it needs replacing. If you get a single drop of water on top of the seat or lid, it soaks through the finish somehow, and causes buckling in the composite material. Since our toilet is in our bathroom, it is occasionally exposed to drops of water here and there. It looks now like the thing has hives. I will never buy from this company again."
5,Very British and Funny!,I bought this book about 15 years ago while stationed in England and Leslie Thomas paints an outstanding picture of British Army life. A recommended read for anyone who enjoys such British authors as P.G. Wodehouse.
2,tarkanian air balls,the concept was so spectacular that it donminated the games for five years.....we all want to know how to do it and he doesnt really explain everything....he appears to be forced to demonstrate it and the players unwilling to cooperate
4,Good Quality,"Our Delonghi coffee urn began leaking at the spout after 3 years and there were no replacement parts available. We replaced it with this unit because parts for it are easily available and it has very good reviews. It is not as heavy duty as other units, but seems more than adequate for its intended purpose. It has an on and off switch which a lot of units don't. So far we are very pleased with it and hope to have and use it for many years.08-04-11 About 8 months later and this urn is still going strong. No problems."
1,Broke quickly,"I had not had it very long, had probably used it about 30 times over the course of several months when it began to leak. Poor quality."
1,Used Once,When I first bought this perculator I opened it and tested it to make sure it worked with only water for a full cycle. It seamed to work fine. I didn't have a use for it until six months later. Still in it's original packaging I used it at a party I catered and to my GREAT disappointment it would not heat enough to perculate. BUMMER! I was sooooo disappointed. It's too late now to return and it's just as expensive to fix as for what I bought it for. I tried taking it apart and followed the exact recommeded cleaning methods. It's clear to me this machine is a dud and I'm stuck with it. I have a 100 cup West Bend Perculator which still works great. Not sure if this is just a model problem. You are taking a chance when you buy this one.
4,A very pleasant selection of different genres,"I read a Spanish translation of this book, a collection of Martin's short stories, and though some are predictable (the Sandkings ending comes to mind, but I won't give it away here), it is enjoyable.Martin handles several different genres in these stories: from horror to science-fiction, visiting fantasy along the way. And he even throws some humor into the mix!A very good read."
4,I will not buy a CRT again.,"I bought this for my xbox 360 and I love it.The only two problems I have with it is the cheap remote you get, you might as well throw it away.The second problem is the response time of 16 ms. In high action fast paced games you may notice a slight blurr, but you really have to be looking for it. Right now I have this set up as my PC monitor and for my Xbox 360 and I love it. The picture is really clear, and the HD is unbelievable. I also paid $200 more than what Amazon.com charges so pick it up it is well worth the $729."
2,worked well for first 2 years,"I bought this tv at Christmas 2005 at Circuit City and paid $1,099.Today it is dead and cannot be repaired. I would have thought it would have lasted much longer than 2 and 1/2 years. I would have expected 5 years usage out of this tv. The lcd screen went bad. I had the foresight to purchase the extended warranty for $300, so I will get a replacement tv, they are giving me a toshiba instead."
1,amazon sucks-this item had been sold months ago!!!,"Your service stinks!!!!This item you think I purchased had been sold months ago!!!!I don't know if that is your fault or the sellers, butI wasted a month thinking the item was on the way!!!Is this your normal way of doning business?????How do you stay in business at this rate????"
4,much needed specialized review,"I was the type of person whom the author describes as familiar on a superficial level with oscillators and their use in trading. This book took me to a deeper level. Lots of good stuff and depth. The author is not shy in documenting oscillators weak-points either, so it's not just a market cheerleading book. Kind of overpriced for a pretty thin paperback, but I'm not sorry I bought it."
1,Home Grown Product,"This DVD is developed by Unprofessional so the lighting, video and audio quality will be extremely poor. The professor who teaches the topic will be keep on writing and talking something in a dark room..........."
2,Lights Back On,"I loved Lights Out 1 and 2, but 3 was a huge disappointment, even after a few listens. Disc 1 begins with a robotechno caucophony that's just straight up weird, painful to listen to, and runs far too long. The rest of Disc 1 gets better, but it still left me waiting for some climactic crescendos or wild mixing twists. CD2 begins with an equally banal sound, and doesn't get interesting until about halfway through. (In fact, the last half of CD2 is the only part of this set that I ever listen to at all anymore.) Overall, the song choice is pretty blah, and even the mixing seems a bit sloppy and uninspired. It's definitely got Lawler's dark and nasty fingerprints throughout, but it sounds a bit canned, and definitely doesn't meet the standard set by 1 and 2."
4,CLOSE TO WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.........,"I HAVE A WOBBLE BOARD AT HOME.....RECENTLY, IT DAWN ON ME THAT I COULD USE IT AS A PRETEND SURFBOARD.......I HEARD SURFING IS A GREAT FORM OF EXERCISE.....SO I WILL USE THIS TAPE,ALONG WITH MY WOBBLE BOARD AND HAVE A NEW FORM OF EXERCISE IN MY HOME GYM."
1,NOTHING AMAZING ABOUT THIS TOY,"I was very disappointed with this, especially as it was on the expensive side. Neither of my cats showed the slightest interest. The toy is a stiff, rather thick plastic coil, which is difficult to trail along the ground (and thus get the cats to chase after it). Sure it gives off pretty pink laser flashes, but that's about it. Also, the batteries ran out quickly (won't be replacing them).Do some more searching -- there are much better interactive cat toys out there."
3,Entertaining alternative,"Okay, so you have seen ""The Abyss"" about eight times, ""Jaws"" four times, ""The Perfect Storm"" once, and ""The Terminator"" a few times. Now, what do you watch? Yes, the theme that ""humans are a virus to the planet earth and have to be eliminated"" is not very original or surprising. Although, the irony that it is a virus that has made this observation is. ""Virus"" is an entertaining reprieve from your usuals. If you can put your ""movie critic"" nature aside, you will enjoy this movie."
3,"I think they lowered the wait, and now NG Fit","Man, what a drag. Unless I am mistaken as to the precise model, I have ordered several pair of these in the past, in black and string, and was DELIGHTED... until this last pair. It seems they have dropped the waist, and they are no longer flattering, but now emphasize the stomach - which is not a great deal for a lot of folks.I hope the manufacturers will PLEASE PLEASE offer the original style as well. Otherwise, I need some advice from you all. What is similar in every way, available at least in black, but has a regular waist? Help!"
2,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with these pants! The cut has changed since the last time I ordered them. The label claims to be ""At the Waist""; it's not, it is about two inches shorter in the rise, and almost two inches below the waist. I have worn these pants for years, they were the only ones I found that actually fit my short legged, plus size build. I can only hope Lee returns to the former pattern!"
4,Comfortable and Forgiving....,"These pants are very comfortable, and very packable when traveling. They last for years and actually improve with age.....in comfortable softness. These pants have been around a long time, so even when I lose enough , I'll buy some more in a smaller size. I like jeans, but these really fit my comfort zone."
1,Not like the old ones,"I was hoping the other reviews were wrong and these fit like they used to by alas, they are very different and I had to send them back. Lee made a mistake changing them!"
3,okay,This book goes over a few strategies very briefly. I haven't tried any because they seem very time consuming without using software designed for this purpose. You still would have to get lucky to win big. If I can't retire off of the winnings it's probably best that I spend my energy concentrating on my day job.
1,save your money on this one,What a waist of good paper. this pamplett is a waist of good money. If you want to use your money go buy a lotto ticket. It will be spent in a better way.
1,Are people really this stupid,"Does anyone with a brain think that the frequency of previous winning numbers has ANY influence on the upcoming numbers? REALLY?????? Lottos and lotteries are a voluntary tax on poor people. Blow your money if you must, but don't think there's any way you can predict the random outcome of such games."
2,The Basics of Winning Lotto/Lottery,"Might have been a good book if it gave some examples;however, did not learn much from it. Got what I paid for."
3,The Basics of Winning Lotto/Lottery,The Basics of Winning Lotto/LotteryThe Basics of Winning Lotto/Lottery is ok. Not really great. I got some good ideas from it
3,common sense,"I had already figured out most of this on my own. Simple logic and common sense to me. However there are some interesting facts about the history of the game, and if you are not normally adept with math, it may be helpful to you. However, I do not think the concept of ""wheeling"" is very clearly explained if you are a novice or if you are not familuar with the mathimatical term."
3,Not Really Helpful but Creative basics,The book itself was ok. I did get the strategy but there wasn't enough information as to winning the lottery. The lottery is a rather luck system. I would have chosen a diffrent book but I did learn a couple new tricks from this book.
2,Elementary and Inaccurate,"This is a layman's attempt at frequency analysis of lottery drawings but it does not use accepted statistical methods to determine whether or not an apparent bias is significant. Unlike roulette wheels, no lottery drawing bowls have yet been found to have any significant bias, let alone enough to overcome the 50% state's edge. The author is not a real professor of anything mathematical."
1,A Money Eater...,"I've had this machine for just over a month. And in that time, it has costed me thousands of dollars worth of revenue in paper and ink due to it's poorness in print quality. I trusted in this product when purchasing it, that it would give me a good boost in working my business, and instead it has done the exact opposite. Paper gets jammed. Prints come out half printed and duplicated on the same print. Changing the settings causes long delays and error messages. It's no good. I hate it, and it's a bad business investment. Customer service wants a chunk out of my wallet just to tell me how to fix it. Really? Over $500.00 spent, and this is what I get, right? And being stuck with it is the biggest pain of 'em all. Who wants a sorry, shabby printer?"
4,Outstanding Book . . . perfect for outdoor ministry!,"Mr. Hansel spins a marvelous book . . . while perhaps thin on scriptural reference, is chock full of wonderful devotional material and program ideas for outdoor ministry and for youth alike. It's an excellent read."
4,reviews,"potato starch is just great,.I used it many years ago when making salads for a restaurant,I used it to stop the lettuce turning brown.Now I just used it to make Lemon butter as my cornstarch because I never had any Gluten Free cornstarch and this worked ust great.It thicken just like cornstarch.I think I will buy more of it when my time to start baking a lot of Gluten-free baking."
4,Does what it's designed to do,This was a nice convenience on our last camping trip. We were relatively close to the bathroom but when it's cold and you're asleep it's nice to have this option. No one had any trouble using it successfully.
3,Its ok,"I must say, I thought this would be a great idea. But if you ""go"" to much in the bags that you buy to go with them, they are very hard to close. We had the bag break open in the bucket on our trip back home. and after sitting in the bucket for days, it was terribly smelly and disgusting to clean up."
2,bucket of poop,"The idea is good, but the material the seat is made of is flimsy. Feels like its cracking under your butt. It is great for kids though."
4,Reliance,I line this with a plastic bag and go around the yard picking up dog poop. The cover keeps bugs and rain out. Then once a week I remove the bag and put it out with the trash.
3,A pot to pee in...,"Once receiving this item I realized I would have been better off buying just the tiolet seat and getting a taller 7 gallon bucket at the hardware store so I wouldn't have to stoop so low. This is a hurricane emergency item for me so I have not actually used it but it's not too hard to imagine. I also purchased biohazard bags from another company to use with it. If I need to use the luggable loo, I'll just thow a scoop of clumping cat litter in there to keep the stink down and absorb any liquid. I think my cats will be eyeing me rather funny."
4,It works great!,"This portable toilet works great. I also bought a privacy hut, and placed it near my tent. I lined the bucket with a dozen small trash bags, and placed a bucket of kitty litter nearby with a scoop. I put about 3 scoops of kitty litter in the bucket. After each use, I tied up the bag and threw it away. I put three scoops of litter in the next bag, and it was good to go for the next use. It was great not to have to walk all the way to the bath house in the middle of the night!"
4,To go or not to go ...,I was beginning to remodel my bathroom and I knew I would need a toilet to use so I ordered Luggable Loo Portable toilet and am I ever glad that I did. No one knew I was without a toilet and I could use it anytime I wished. I think all houses should have one for a back up in case of emergencies.
5,light easy to carry around.,love the biodegradeable bags too. i recomend for anyone to use. very easy to install the bags too. i love it.
5,Lifesaver,"I have one recommendation... buy the lid only. Hindsight being 20/20, I didn't think about this, but you can buy buckets for $2.50 at Lowes or Home Depot. We bought the Luggable Loo, both lid and bucket. Used it lined with trashbag and cat litter. It worked like a dream camping in a primitive campground. When we were done, we tied up the bag, took off (and kept) the lid, and dumbed the entire thing into the garbage. No touching, no mess."
5,Perfect!,"This incredibly simple little item has to be the most perfect ""potty"" for remote camping! Super easy to manage. I followed some of the advice I'd seen on reviews of this product and really - what more could a mom taking a bunch of teenage kids camping ask for! Thank you to those who suggested kitty litter - great idea - worked like a charm. I also used the BioGel which really helped reduce any slosh. I also used Glad's flex force bags doubled to give me that extra sense of security - no problems at all! This ""Loo"" takes away any excuse for us gals in particular not to go out and do some REAL camping!"
5,Life saver,This product is fantastic. It has been a real life saver. We use it at our land where we stay in a pop-up. I was having to go outside in the middle of the night and it is getting too cold to do that. I just use kitty litter and there is no smell and it is very easy to take care of if you use a double bag. Very good investment. Would highly recommend.
1,the lid/seat was missing,"i recieved the bucket just fine. However, the lid/seat attachment was not included. I waited a few days, thinking maybe it was being shipped seperately. Nope! I have left messages for Amazon since this seller had no link to contact them. I spent almost 30 dollars for a 5 gallon bucket!!"
1,Bio Blue Sol-U-Pak and septic systems,"The 1 star rating applies to the Bio Blue Sol-U-Pak that comes with the portable loo. I give portable loo product itself a 5 star rating, but people who are on septic systems should beware of disposing of any waste water that has the Bio Blue Sol-U-Pak in it into a septic system. The label of the Sol-U-Pak does not say that it is safe for septic systems, but it says that it is 'biodegradable' so I was hoping that it would be Ok for the septic system, but it wasn't Ok.My advice is to not let the Bio Blue Sol-U-Pak get into your septic system because the result is not nice."
3,Portable lug all ice canister Makes Life Easy,"This portable lug all ice canister for outdoor parties comes with a 2 year guarantee that does not include the handle, lid or injuries sustained while lugging 50 lbs of ice. Made of a rugged plastic, it insulates ice, beverages, frozen frogs, or dead fish, in the extremity of the cold. Easy open flask allows for effortless removal of objects. Can also be used as a stool at fishing tournaments or as a temporary manure storage unit at sheep shearing festivals."
5,Works exactly as advertised.,"As I'm sure you figured out, this is simply a toilet seat that snaps over the top of a five gallon bucket. It locks in place firmly, and gives you a secure and comfortable place to sit. I have found it to be hygenic and easy to clean and transport. I use a small trash bag inside, and the powder that is supplied with the toilet works really well for containing odors (I bought more packets of the powder at my local REI store). I use this in my woodshop, and it's perfect for that application.At least one review said this is lower than a conventional toilet, but it's not. I set the two side by side, and they are pretty much identical in height. It's a simple product that does exactly what it says. And if you have a conventional 5-gallon bucket available, you can also save a little money by purchasing the toilet set by itself."
5,Ice fishing?,"When you gotta go, why pollute the lake. I recommend using a double bag and some kitty litter to absorb the liquid. Not a sealed unit so if you are lugging the loo in the back of your truck and it tips over you'll be glad for the kitty litter and the twist tie. You can buy the seat and a separate five gallon bucket to save expenses."
5,Emergency or Camping,"I live way out in the sticks. Power outtages and water going off is part of living out this far. So I bought this to use JUST IN CASE. When I got it I wanted to sit on it and test how it holds up. I'm 220lbs, this thing is small but not uncomfortable. I sat on it for about 10 minutes and was satisfied that it would work in a emergency, or to take camping. Instead of buying expensive bags to just make a mess of, I will buy some small kitchen bags, tie the bottom in a knot, and add some RV chemical toilet treatments which are alot cheaper. The best one ive found is the campground friendly rv toilet treatment about 5 a bottle and will treat a bucket for a year or more. 16 treatments for 20gallons or more... well u just can't go wrong, just don't over do it. I'm guessing it would take less than a shot glass full per treatment add about 1/2 gallon of water and do your deed."
4,'Wish I had had one on the last campout!,"Thankfully, I really haven't needed this yet, but it is comforting to know it is available when I need it!"
4,Perfect Toilet for Camping,I bought this portable toilet to keep in my tent at night. Now I don't have to get up and go into the cold during the middle of the night. I set it up with a trash bag and sprinkle kitty litter in the bottom. Works perfect for my needs.
1,Too pricey!,You can buy a real toilet seat for $10 and a 5 gallon busket for $4. Add nails to bottom of seat to fit bucket and hold plastic bag - and you're set......with a cheaper and more familiar setting (if you'll pardon the pun.)
4,functional,"we found this product very functional. we put a little kitty litter in the bottom, but cat litter is meant for cats....needless to say, we had a small lump of litter in alot of fluid!!! just use a bag."
3,Practical luggable,I had a similar version of a simple portable toilet before which I used instead of the portable toilets provided at outdoor events. This particular version was the only one available in that price range that I could find online. It is okay tho' I liked my other and now defunct one more. This seems flimsy tho' it works fine. It is too tall and the top doesn't fit tight nor does the lid open to its full swing enough. It serves the purpose however.
4,A good lens for the price,"I've used this lens for the last 4 years and taken about 2500 photos with it. It's been used on an EOS 3, a 10D, a 20D, a 5D, and a 400D (which looks quite funny, you can hardly see the camera). It takes a very good photo and the image stabilisation is very helpful, for me about 2 stops. Focus is a bit slow compared to USM but bearable. It is heavy, but so is any other zoom in this range. I would buy it again without hesitation (unless I become really wealthy). It extends a long way when zoomed and with the lens hood on it looks really big."
5,Good Book,"Very funny, with a few twists. Loved the characters, and their personalities. Pretty quick read, good if you like funny books."
4,Absolutely hilarious. And inappropriate.,"This book was absolutely hilarious. Most of the humor is completely inappropriate but you'll laugh anyway. It's a good look at how easy simply not caring would be and how much easier it would make our lives... until you move in next to a guinnea pig rapist, somebody ends up dead, you're covered in salt and the cops make you give a DNA sample in a ziploc bag. It's a quick couple hundred pages you'll be glad you read, especially if you need a laugh."
4,"Great start, but where'd the steam go?","Like others here, I think several parts of the book are read-aloud funny. The funny parts, however, are towards the beginning where we are getting accustomed to Shane's take on life and people. As the book progresses, what makes Shane's inner dialogue funny ends up making it sad and kind of pathetic. The murder mystery driving most of the book was wrapped up in two pages and seriously, what was the deal with the salt shakers? I kept expecting some explanation for his compulsion, some glowing revelation, but none came.I'd really give this book 3.5 stars. Three isn't giving it enough credit, while four is too much. I really enjoyed the book overall, especially the first half, and I think it is a great debut. I will definitely pick up the author's next book based on this one and I recommend it to anyone that, like the jacket says, liked Office Space."
1,No thanks,"This was a hard read. I could tell about 1/3 of the way through that this was not going to go anywhere. I agree with the try-hard prose. I feel as though this was written by a very angsty undergrad who has no real experience to share. Instead, forcing a writing style on you that you have to dredge through to see if there is any meaning at the end. There rarely is."
1,If I could give it a negative star I would,"This is a huge piece if crapI wanted to like it. I really wanted to. But it turned out to be a very long boring and mean story. Told by a college guy. So if you're in a fraternity, you will love this. A long wandering pointless story spiked with meanness from a total a$$. If the author's goal was to create a character that was self centered. Unaware Cruel. Useless. Yay! Good for you! You did it! I'm only a third of the way through this rambling directionless tale of a guy who is constantly at the dentist when he's not sleeping in the handicapped stall at work or having sex with his landlord's wife in lieu of rent We won't even get into the neighbor raping Ivan the hamster. Then there's the murder of the deaf dental assistant he is accused of. I don't even care how it ends. Throw him in jail. Set him on fire. Drag him behind a truck. Make this awful nightmare Of the written word end."
3,Aptly Titled,"Memo to Paul:When writing a book, it is fundamentally essential for the author to make his/her protagonist at least superficially likeable--or interesting. No need to thank me.Reading APATHY AND OTHER SMALL VICTORIES is akin to swallowing air. Nada. Granted, Neilan's bizarre musings make for some eyebrow-raising passages, and much of the story is funny, but at the end of the day I walked away from this book feeling completely underwhelmed. A story about a chronic underachiever who cares about nothing and lives for nothing ultimately comes to the grand total of: Nothing.Neilan has talent, to be sure, and I hope he takes that talent to the next level by creating a solid, edgy comedy that makes the reader crave for more. But APATHY. . .I started this book with giddy high hopes. . .and finished it feeling as passionless as I've ever felt about a book in all my days. And that, my friends, that is apathy.--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On"
2,Disappointing - Bad Amazon Recommendation!,"Because I like Max Barry (Syrup, Jennifer Government, Company) Amazon thought I would like this book. I finished it, which is more than I can say for JPOD. (I REALLY want my money back on that one!) Amazon was wrong. This wasn't a very good book. It had brief moments of dark, sarcastic humor surrounded by a vast wasteland of nonsensical drivel.Utlimately, it was readable and I don't think that Amazon should have to give me my money back like they should do with JPOD, but in the end I will be avoiding other Paul Neilan offerings in the future. Just not enough meat on the bone in his writing."
1,Boring,This was a real bore to read. I was struggling just to finish it. This is a poor rip off of Chuck Palahniuk's work. Don't bother.
1,Better on Stage,"This book may be the basis of a live comedy routine, but as a book there is no there there. A series of commentaries (more cynical than funny, more Seinfeld that Robin Williams) on life in the new millennium needs a seemingly afterthought murder investigation to cobble together a facsimile of a plot. The author's own dedication says it all, ""To my parents, who will hopefully never read this book."" Neither should anyone else."
5,Hysterically Funny!!!,"I'm not a book critic so you won't see anything in this review about how this book does or doesn't convey an underlying sense of the struggles between man and his conscience, blah, blah, blah. Bottom line is I read fiction books for entertainment and this one is wildly entertaining!! I think I pulled more than a few abdomen muscles from laughing so much!! It's hard to believe this is Neilan's first book! Most of the situations Shane finds himself in are totally routine (except the landlord with the rodent slave), but Shane's thoughts and reactions to them are brilliant!! I could certainly see this book turn into a movie in the same class as The Big Lebowski, Napolean Dynamite, Pulp Fiction and a host of other dark comedic flixs. You have to read this, unless you have a political correctness problem!!"
5,"""The world is your oyster, but you are allergic to shellfish""","Ok, here's how this is going to go: Paul Neilan is going to write another 3 or 4 books, and one of them will get turned into a movie, and only then will people get hip to how good of a writer he is. I love reading a book with good dialog, and this one definately has that. It's the kind of book that you really can read in one sitting. Now I'm just hoping he can push out a new book every year, rather than taking several years between novels."
3,"Very funny writing, very weak story","Some of the writing in this book really is ""read out loud"" funny; I found myself hounding others with certain passages. It is also intensely dark and a little gross, but it works well with the main character.The first half, or maybe three-fifths, of the book is easily the best. The writing is extremely funny and the absurdity of the characters is genuinely fascinating. But the story takes a nosedive when the author starts focusing on, well, the story. It seems like Neilan convinced a publisher to take this book on the basis of essays he had written. This guy could really be effective as a comedic essayist, but I guess he wanted to write a book.Overall, the book was a very enjoyable, and very quick, read. I would definitely recommend it to those who like good funny. I think I would buy his next book because, hopefully, he will be able to cobble together a better story the second time around."
3,"starts off funny, tapers to dull","Funny, but the main character becomes too much of an a-hole, and the plot thickens, then slows. Felt forced and contrived."
4,Made me laugh quite a bit.,"I enjoyed this book for what it was, a quick, easy read with some quirkiness to its characters and a strange mystery. I'm not sure if I remember actually liking anyone in it, but that may have been the point. But if you're just looking for a way to while away an afternoon laughing at some strange situations and observations, then this might be the book for you."
3,Apathetic about the book....,"This is a book about a guy who is sarcastic, underwhelmed by everything, underachieving, and well, apathetic. It's fairly anticlimactic. There are some funny parts, but not nearly as funny as other reviewers make it out to be. He makes funny observations about people that we can all relate to. It's a story about a few days in his life and how he is the suspect in the murder of an acquaintance. This book is just okay. It is a quick read and fairly entertaining, but forgettable. I cannot say that I would recommend this to anyone, but I do not necessarily regret reading it. I suppose my reivew is rather apathetic."
3,Hardly an investigation,"""When one of the women is murdered, and Shane is the only suspect who doesn't care enough to act like he didn't do it, the question becomes just how he'll clear the good name he never had and doesn't particularly want: his own.""I didn't get the sense that Shane was somehow a ""suspect"" in dead woman's murder investigation. Most of the book is a meandering of engagements with different characters. There was hardly an investigation where Shane appeared to be disinterested. From the book's discription, one would guess that this book was some kind of murder mystery/investigation book. It is not.I thought the book was OK, but not good enough to finish. If there was more going on with the supposed investigation, I would have been interested to finish the book. It just not seem to really go anywhere."
3,Funny but...,"I thought the book was very funny, but the plot line was not captivating. Read this book for the humor, but not for the story."
4,"Hilarious, though plotless","If you're expecting a solid plot you'll be disappointed. Otherwise, you'll love it. This book had me laughing to the point of tears. I've re-read it twice and I still find myself laughing until my stomach hurts. The plot is weak, as is the ending, but the book is so completely hilarious that you won't care."
5,Funniest Book I've Ever Read,"Dark comedy in a rapid-fire, no-holds-barred book about an average man's travels through what could be average society. Highly recommend."
2,"Amusing, but ultimately infuriating","Very few writers have the ability to take a distinctly unlikable character, and make you like them. Nick Hornby (High Fidelity) immediately comes to mind. Paul Neilan comes close on occasion, but ultimately fails. While there are undoubtedly many humorous interludes, the overall book fails to hold you as a reader. The character is not rich enough to give you any reason to overlook, or even care about, his flaws. The pacing of the book is also a little curious. The bulk of the story is in the last 50 pages or so. Most of the rest of the book is just setting the scene."
5,funniest book ever,"read it.....just read the damn book!there comes a time in every man's life when he wakes up drunk on the toilet and begins to doubt the choices he has made. and when that time comes at least twice a day, every day. something needs to be done."
4,I had to take a knee...,"I know others have probably said it before me, but I consider myself too cool to actually ""laugh at loud"". At best, I may chuckle. This book had me almost crying, choking, and pissing myself....simultaneously. On the critical side, it's too short and the end is lacking, but it seems to me that most contemporary authors struggle with good conclusions to good story ideas. I would best describe this book as Pallahniuk-esqe, but slightly less morose...but not much less (that's a good thing)."
5,Neilan really delivers in his debut!,Apathy and Other Small Victories is about as funny as a book can get! I literally could not put it down! Its really easy to read and delivers one laugh out loud moment after another. Its fairly short and not at all difficult to read. Definitely pick this one up - you'll be sorry when you finish it!
3,The message is there...,"Among all the ranting that makes up the bulk of this mostly amusing work of pop fiction there lies one paragraph that I feel sums up what Neilan was trying to say. It's the last paragraph on page 147. Search for ""But it didn't happen"" in the ""Search this book!"" thingy, it's the last result."
3,"Funny, dark, poorly edited","This is one of two books I've bought recently because the cover caught my eye. I wasn't too disappointed -- parts of it are very funny, but overall the book is poorly edited in terms of basic mechanics. I don't have a copy in front of me, but I was annoyed as a reader and for the writer. He should have gotten better care.For some reason, his writing and the way the plot is structured reminded me of some of Steve Martin's books, especially ""The Pleasure of My Company."" Different voices but similar subtle effects, at least for this reader. Maybe it's the sense of isolation around the main character.Neilan definitely has a point of view, even if it is sort of post-modern slacker, and I hope to read more of his *edited* work in the future."
3,"Good, but wears a little thin by the end","Neilan has written Shane somewhere between Peter Gibbons of Office Space and Tyler Durden of Fight Club without blatantly ripping off either. Apathy is not as funny as the former nor as dark or culturally vitriolic as the latter, but it is probably more palatable to many because of this balance."
5,Foundation of our Constitution,"By far, the best thing I have ever seen on the basis for development of our Constitution. The very notion of our founders' complete agreement on the need for a republic form of government, the need of a written constitution and the necessary principles to be embodied in the document is nothing, if not a miracle. The founders' knowledge and understanding, of what works, what doesn't and why, demonstrates enormous depth in governance and economics, and the value of individual responsibility and freedom. An interesting, useful and little known subject that was highlighted was the Anglo-Saxon method of governing going back more than 1500 years.This book should be used to form the basis of a required class on the Constitution to be taught with increasing depth each year from the 7th through the 10th year.Excellent!"
5,The Five Thousand Year Leap,This book should be read by every American alive today. It should be manadatory in every school and college in the entire United States as it really explains how the US was set up originally and how our Constitution should work. The PEOPLE should control the governments and they are here for our convenience and protection nothing else.
3,intrepretion simplified,"skousen uses citations from the usual suspects in making case for divine inspiration for creation and intent of us constitution. good read with ease of understanding the natural laws of man and the ideas of freedom. from a strict perspective skousen simplfies complex theory of constitutional law and how it should be intrepreted. not much room for grey in founders intent according to skousen. a good read nevertheless. mark hobbs, new mexico"
5,Best information on our founding fathers - Teaches True History,"With the purchase of the Five Thousand Year Leap I have a greater understanding of our founding fathers and their vision for our country. There is so much information in this book its hard to put it down. The author sites all of his sources, many of which come directly from the founding fahters via letters and documents. This book should be required reading in our schools. The information in this book shows clearly how our history has been changed by politics. We no longer teach our children the real history of this country. THIS BOOK TEACHES THE HISTORY AS IT HAPPENED AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PUSH TO PUT THIS BOOK ON THE REQUIRED READING FOR EVERY STUDENT IN AMERICA."
3,Just buy the original,"I read the original - see link here: The 5000 Year Leap: The Miracle That Changed the World. It was a fantastic, 5 star read! This fancy 30 year anniversary publication still has the original text, but is encumbered with two unrelated articles by the author, a copy of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution that everyone has, and a forward by Glenn Beck that you can read online. Save the extra 5 or 10 bucks and just buy the original."
5,Read this book to understand the founding of our Republic,I have a greater understanding of the founding of our republic and the philosophy that guided our founding fathers. These men created this nation to have individual freedom as the corner stone of our experience.
1,Really???,"Isn't it amazing how our mind rearranges information so it fits our personal bias? With his skewing of the clearly defined ""religious"" views of Jefferson to fit his thesis, Skousen looses all credibility. I love his dance of religious freedom as long as it is a religion he supports."
5,Every American needs to read this book!,"""the Five Thousand Year Leap"" provides the critical information of who we are as Americans and what our country stands for. It explains the unique relationship of how the Constitution and Christianity meets to form the perfect union. I could not recommend it more highly!"
3,five thousand year leap,fantastic book. not able to use cd-rom because I didn't understand that after downloading to computer that I couldn't transfer to mp3 audio. My intent was to listen during a long trip in car. The folks at Best Buy assured that I could transfer when I purchased mp3 player.
5,Great source of information,"I initially bought this book on paperback. Accidentally left at home for vacation, so I bought the kindle edition instead. I was very pleased to find that the citations were properly linked not just to the source, but provided the ENTIRE paper or letter used as the source for full context.I intend to conveniently leave my paper copy on a bench somewhere and continue to use my kindle version as a reference book."
1,Skousen is a fake,"Completely discredited by BYU, Skousen consistently misrepresents the material he is presenting. He misrepresents ideas of the Founding Fathers, pulls quotes completely out of context from place like the Federalist Papers, cherry picks his source material - often twisting quotes to mean the exact opposite of their original context, and draws tortured conclusions from wholly unrelated material. There is a reason he was thrown out of BYU - he is a terrible 'scholar.' Read some of his quotes in their original context to see how utterly dishonest he is."
4,The 5000 Year Leap,"The endorsements on the back cover, encourage this book to be included in both high school and college cirriculum. It's an eye opener to anyone, even those, like me, that had studied US History in high school and minored in US History in college. This book gives great insight into the founding fathers, their intent in writing the consitution and other historical documents and puts in perspective what the intended role of our congressional, juditial and presidential leadership was.The author points out that we have lost our way. I'm sure some will read this a politically biased but I think he did a wonderful job of stating historical facts and has the research documented to back it up.Wonderful, educational, inspiring and convicting. A read required by every citizen wether born here or naturalized!!"
5,"5,000 year leap",Everyone should read this. It should be taught in the schools.Obie definitely needs to read it!
3,Mediocre As The Rest of the World,"All cultures have a mythology that supports them. This book gives the reader a good dose of the American mythology: greatest nation the world has ever known and all that. Mythology is important - don't get me wrong. I love Joesph Campbell as much as the next guy. The trouble starts when a culture's mythology starts to crumble. Or taken literally ... and a little too seriously. Our trouble isn't the former as is commonly believed, but the later. America is really, really good at a lot of things, but mostly we are as mediocre as the rest of the world but we just don't want to see it."
3,Highly recommended by Glenn Beck,This book comes highly recommended by Glenn Beck. Glenn Beck is an arbiter of literary taste and contemporary philosophy in the United States.De gustibus non disputandum est.
1,A swarm of made up conclusions and unreliable information,Once again W. Cleon Skousen tries to manipulate his reader by using completely unreliable and unsubstantiated claimes as truth. He attempts to use Mormon ideaology and supplant it into our minds with unsubstantiated conclusions. Very dissapointing read.
1,A ridiculous tale from and for the minds of children,"I tried to read this book with an open mind, but it was clear from the first page that logical thinking or even decent writing are totally absent from these pages. There are so many misunderstandings of basic history, errors of fact, quotes out of context, etc--that this published work should be sent back to the editor for some basic proof-reading.Basically, this work should be considered an echo chamber edition for all those people who already hold certain beliefs about the world--and are only reading this for fulfillment from a supposed ""thinker."""
4,Excellent Reading,My husband and I both read this book and would highly recommend it to any American citizen - Very enlightening.
5,Truth,"Mr. Skousen has done some in depth research on the Founding Fathers and has been able to highlight the framework for the United States of America. This book is a good read for anyone who believes that the United States needs to look no further than the U.S. Constitution to solve the current matters of today. This book may not have all the facts, however, it will definitely point you in the right direction to get the answer of any question(s) you may have."
3,"Excellent material, but you have to concentrate","The material in this book is absolutely excellent and should be required for any politician before being able to take office! So few Americans truly understand how our great nation was built and upon which values and principles the Constitution stands.The audio version of the book is read by Cleon Skousen's son, whose voice is not particularly compelling. I bought the CD version so I could listen to the book while driving, but I found that I have to turn it off when I really need to pay attention to the road! It's definitely not ""bubble-gum"" reading. I loved the forward by Glenn Beck.I wish this were also required reading for all students to graduate from high school. It's a bit heavy, but our country would be stronger if more people understood these founding principles."
5,Great Read,"I thought this was an excellent book to delve into some of the American government policies that are prevalent today and relate them to the political philosophy of our founding fathers. Some have jeered this book as a Christian beliefs promotional, untrue. It does promote religion or belief of some sort. I would recommend this book to anyone whom is interested in learning more about the American founding fathers and today's politics."
1,product does not reflect picture,The cute picture of this bear does not reflect what I recieved in the mail. The way the hat is made makes this bear costume look more like a rabbit. The ears are at the top of the head and are directly next to each other. Also in the picture the hat looks like it is a velco fastener but my hat was a tie around my infant's neck which is not safe. The neck opening is very small and clearly unsafe for for an infant.
5,Good product from a good company,I have worked with several good KVM switches and Belkin producst are always quality products.
3,A searing look at life on campus...,"A friend recommended this book, knowing that I was returning to graduate school. It's bizarre, often funny, and sometimes surprisingly touching. Yesterday, I was enduring a too long lecture on Sartre's philosophy of literature when I began to wonder what kind of ""animal"" my professor might be. Ms. Roney has recorded some of the more strange anecdotes of a life spent in academia; these sketches are a searing look at life on campus. That was my obstacle in finishing the book: At times the humor was too caustic, too scathing for my taste. If you can get past that, though, the stories are wildly imaginitive and entertaining."
3,Hi Dharma!,"Overly slapstick and juvenile at times, but still an entertaining fluff. Most of the laughs come from the clever dialogues and off-beat situations, however. The exaggerated physical comedy falls flat more often than not."
2,Childish,This is a bad buddhist movie. Quite childish. Is this what a slapstick comedy is supposed to be?
5,Frommers' Nepal 1999,"This was the first book I bought to get ready for my trip to Nepal. I have not gone on that trip yet, but after reading this book I felt ready to tackle any travel encounters that may come my way. This book has extensive travel information to Nepal, dozens of phone numbers and up-to-date internet URL's related to Nepal and travel needs, as well as good information about hotels, restaurants, sights, you name it. This is a fantastic book to start out with if you are planning on visiting Nepal, and the price here is much less than what I paid for it at B&N. Happy traveling!"
5,forgotten rock,"I just bought this cd and listened to it-superb!I've known aboutlillian way back,had a couple of releases,but somehow pass thisback in the day.I'm glad I now have this!.the best ones are""the world stopped turning""and ""ghost of winter"".But this discdoes truly rock like the song ""show a little love""-really catchyand great hooks.buy this!-it's worth $25."
4,Gidget gets an A,"Watching this movie takes you back a few years. It is a great film and I think Sally Field makes the best Gidget. This is a movie to be shared with generations to come, and it is a perfect movie for a family night because it is very clean."
3,I only got this video for Pete Duel's appearence,"But he's not in it enough. Over all this isn't bad for a Gidget show, and the little Pete's in it he's wonderful."
3,Dramatic and Hilarious Collection,"I laughed so hard and was touched by all the wonderful performances of these characters.Neil Simon has a knack for making the characters believable and real, and I thought that some of the works ended too soon. I want to know more about the characters' lives and what happened before and after the play situations. I wish he could go back and do a George Lucas thing and write the prequels and sequels to these fine masterpieces.I love these plays and so do all my friends. My High School even performed Rumors my senior year, I was so thrilled to be a part of it. I got to play Glenn Cooper. It was so much fun.I bought this book from Amazon.com the second I found it and you should, too. (mainly because you wont find it anywhere else, I checked)."
5,Awesome Book,This is the kind of book a child can easily learn about the major topics of the Cold War. Al they have to do is use it like a regular encyclopedia. Also it is a book someone can read to learn more about the Cold War. Also if your a veteran from of the wars during the Cold War you would read this and have nostalgia. This overall is a great book.
3,close but no cigar!,"I purchased this as a flyfishing/hiking/hydration pack. I like the backpack/chest pack, but as a hydration pack, it should of came supplied with with the hydration bottle..........for about $175 or so, they could of included the plactic bag!"
2,Picture Quality and Sound Needs Work,"I found the picture quality of both movies especially the ""Underworld"" movie to be below digital standards. Today's technologies have made it possible for us to be able to see and hear these old movies better than the quality of video and audio I witnessed when I watched this DVD. I am actually sorry that I bought it but the movie ""Manhattan"" was the only movie worth watching because it's plot and acting were far better than the acting abilities displayed in the movie ""Underworld"". So, in closing I would say to anyone who loves old movies that if you want to see the movie ""Manhattan"" on DVD then go ahead and buy it but watch out for the quality of the copy."
1,Doesn't feel like it works...,"I used the Philips SonicCare for years before that went away (working fine with my GF as she went off to school).. I had high hopes for this band.. It's sleek and modern looking.. It vibrates, but from what I can figure out it vibrates over such a small range that the head barely moves. Specifically, not enough to be useful. My teeth don't get remotely clean unless I brush like a regular tooth brush (in which case, I'm not sure the vibration helps that much).. A closer look at the mechanics reveals it doesn't actually even move the toothbrush head directly. There is a vibrating motor in the body, which vibrates the whole upper part of the toothbrush, but maybe I'm just spoiled by my old one.. For a very few extra bucks, I'd say go for the phillips..."
3,"Yes, the brush heads do pop off","It has been suggested that we are applying too much pressure while brushing with our Cybersonic brushes, causing the head to pop off the power handle. Amden Corp. suggests in the Cybersonic owner's manual to apply ""moderate-firm pressure"". Even very light pressure causes mine to pop off after a few weeks' use. In fact, the attachments fall off the storage base almost automatically. Otherwise, the brush is great. The electromagnetic induction battery charging method has worked fine for me. I have used this brush for three years and have had no problems, other than the ""pop-off heads"", and finding replacement brush heads locally."
4,it cleans well,"don't press hard let it glide and the brush don't fall off, your teeth feels very clean"
5,This is Awesome!,"I love this tray. I cannot believe it was so inexpensive. I use mine for outdoor entertaining. It is sturdy, pretty, and well made. I have also given as gifts. What a perfect vessel to present a gift on too! I thisnk I'll buy some more and keep on hanf as hostess gifts too."
5,my son loved this,we purchased this for his bday and he loves ithe named it sharkeyhe sleeps with it every night :)
5,Love it!!!,"I have loved sharks since I was a kid. I had my son June 2007 and to my surprise when I got to my room after giving birth I had this shark instead of blue balloons, flowers and the ""it's a boy!"" sign. My best friend bought it for me and it was the perfect ""congrats, you just had a baby gift."" Haha. I am currently searching for more stuffed animal sharks, but they all seem to be a little to sweet looking. I love that this shark looks like a real shark. My son is now 8 months old and he loves the shark, we have tons of pictures of him and his shark.He is soft, well made and you can't beat the price."
5,Great Big Shark,My 5 year old is all about sharks right now. Bought him this shark and it is nearly as tall as he is. Quality is great. I am impressed. Great buy.
4,Good value!,"This shark is big and sturdy. I thought it would be very soft and fluffy and easily squished, but it's not; its stuffing is firmer than I was expecting for a stuffed animal, which I actually like better because it seems more durable that way. My only complaint is that the eyes come off easily. Nothing a little super glue can't fix, but I wish they'd have come fastened securely so I wouldn't have to go out and buy super glue. All in all, my son loves this shark and sleeps with it every night."
3,Large stuffed shark,"This item is just okay. It's big which is just what my son wanted. However, within a very short time, both of the eyes fell off. They are not easy to refasten on, so it looks a little ridiculous, and unfortunately took away from it's glamour for our son. Other than the eyes, it's held together."
2,Fell apart the first day,"It's really cute but poor quality. My son got it as a gift and was thrilled, but within a few hours, one of the eyes had fallen off and the seam was ripping open."
3,Allergic Reaction,I don't know if its just me or there are more people out there but upon taking this I broke out in a rash mostly my hands and feet also swelling big time it took a week to subside. Scary because I don't know of anything besides dust and mold that I'm allergic too. If you order this product I wouldn't recommend any more than one pill to see how you react. As with all supplements take the minimum first before upping dosage.I give it an average score because this might not happen to everyone.
4,Good book but not enough,"This is a good book which will help you to perform better in basic troubleshooting but it's not great as I was expected. The best part of this book is easy to read and understand. However for anyone who is preparing the CCNP, this book will be very much useful."
3,Disappointed.,"My disappointment isn't in the movie itself, as I was VERY excited to find this film available in the US! I've been wanting a copy since I had the opportunity to watch it a few years back... however, the fact that it is for some reason DUBBED IN CANTONESE just ruins it for me :( It takes out a lot of emotion from the talented cast of Korean actors and actresses in this film. It doesn't even have an option for the original Korean audio track.POOP!... now if you can go find a used rental that has the Korean audio in tact, I TOTALLY recommend this film!"
2,"A great movie, poorly presented","We have been trying for some time to buy a copy of this great little movie, so we were delighted to find one on Amazon. We are fairly fussy about the format we watch movies in, and this one could not be put into it's correct screen shape on any of our dvd settings. The 'Extras' were fine, but we were obliged to watch the main feature with everything stretched! Perhaps it's something to do with the Korean formats, but sadly, we had to throw it in the bin! I know there are many folk who probably don't worry about this sort of thing, and for them, it's an excellent movie."
4,Large bucks hunted in Texas,"Thompson Temple guides several hunters in their quest for large bucks. He educates the viewer about hunting methods and habitat. I find Thompson to be an ethical hunter who respects his quarry at all times. You won't see unethical behavior at all. If you enjoy hunting videos, you should strongly consider adding this one to your collection. This is a DVD that can be enjoyed over and over again."
3,"decent, not great","If you are looking for a hunting video this one is alright. It is not that informative. Its not really well-done. No it simply cures the winter itch for some hunting pictures. I guess what I am saying is this: ""It is a basic video, thats not much other than a simple hunting flic."""
2,Well written but Orientalist,"Khilnani has interesting chapters on cities, on post-independence politics. But he gives no thought to the `native' perspectives which is why he is unable to explain the emergence of the BJP. The book is a good articulation of the liberal position but there is more to the idea of India than just that."
1,A Macaulayite view of India,"This book will not provide any insight into India, but perhaps it will do so into the mindset of the Macaulayite Indian who is completely cut off from his tradition and is trying to make sense of things about him using Western categories. It takes us nowhere understanding the idea of India."
1,Cliched!,"The title of the book is very inviting but, unfortunately, the author doesn't prove equal to the challenge of the subject. Mainly, he reiterates ideas of the colonialist-leftist school of Indian history."
3,Fascinating India,"I liked this book a lot when I first read it in 1997. at that time I found it fascinating. To me, it was a seminal book, and my 3 star rating may be a but unfair, since I have given this book a three star on my second reading, and after I have read many more books on my own home country.For a first time reader of such books, I can actually recommend no better. The writing is very clear, very lucid. I like the way in which he has divided the subjects. It makes this very clear to read chunks of the book independently.This is a great glimpse into the making the making of modern India, and is a good book for Indians and foreigners alike.What I would have liked, however, is more detail on what is happening in India now, as seen through his eyes"
3,average ;-),I had great expectations for this album based on various recommendation on the web. It features the brilliant Carlos Vega on drums and that's really the only reason i'm keeping it.. that aren't really any outstanding or memorable tunes.. technically the playing is great. If you like Michael Camilo you will probably like this.
3,Simple and Quick,"This is fine for simple and quick stuff, like writing happy birthday on a cake, but that is about it. A few days after I received this I saw a similar kit at the dollar store that came with a quite a few more tips than this did. Overall it is okay, but i would not buy this expecting to do any elaborate decorating."
3,not too bad,"i got this kit for my first attempt at cake decorating...a turtle cake for my one year old son's party. i had previously bought a kit from wilton, but the tips seemed too big for what i wanted to do so i went with this one instead. it worked well, but my recommendation is that you get a few of these at least, to handle different colors and avoid washing it out all the time. the only con to it is that it's got a very small capacity, so you decorate for a few minutes and then have to refill it. my cake wasn't that big so it wasn't a huge deal, but a little annoying. it was very well-priced and got here fast, however. i wish i had ordered a few, because i ended up paying way more for shipping than the actual product itself! not a bad little kit though, i would recommend it."
4,A Cheap way to decorate a cake,When you can't quite afford the Wilton's cake decorating tips and accessories this will work just as good for a cheaper price. I would recomend this product.
4,Ekco ake decorating set---great set for the price,"I bought this for my grandchildren to see if they liked decorating cakes, etc. They had fun with it. It worked well for a beginner, but a more experienced cook might want a set with more attachments and larger pieces."
1,"Not funny, McGee","The major problem with these ""B"" films is that they are in no way funny. There is a bit of populist romanticism, but you'll fail to find anything that is unpredictable or even amusing. You'd be embarrassed by reading the scripts. Remember that the years in which these films were made are still within the ""golden age"" of American movies, including the often brilliant Screwball comedies. Lum and Abner fail to rise to the level of the Bowery Boys. In short, don't bother."
2,"Promissing idea, big marketing campaign, lame result=stale fiction","I bought this book expecting an adventure. I have heard of the rare person who remembers in full detail previous lives and existences. So I was expecting a great book. I was disapointed. From the beginning nothing seemed to ring true. I kept waiting for the book to come alive, but it never did. The book just kept dredging along. Everything seemed flacid and boring. Descriptions seemed usurped from modern day knowledge. The mysteries revealed were weakly described. The rare description of the afterlife and the laws of karma were wrong. While some preliminary research was probably done into the subject matter, in my opinion this book is nothing more than a stale attempt at fiction. It's information rather than intuited was invented."
1,Large Pills,"I bought these from a vitamin store for $10 more than this. Can't say if they work or not as the pills are huge. After I got the first one stuck in my throat, I threw the bottle away. I take a vitamin mineral supplement every day and these pills are way bigger around and longer than the Vitamin supplement."
5,Really adorable owl charm!,"This is a super cute italian charm of an owl. This one is white, but the same company also offers a grey one. Great price, quality, shipping costs, and delivery."
3,non professional,"This book is difficult to use without a teacher. A translation of the dialogues would have been welcome since many words are not included in the glossary! The verb is another nightmare because the inflexions are prefixed unlike english (suffixed). If you look for the translation of 'worked' (suppose you learn english), you will look in the dictionary for 'work'. But if you look for the translation of 'naalnish' you will have to search thru every inflected forms of every verbs in Appendix A! If the stems of the verbs (in this example '-nish') had been included in the dictionary , it would have made the task easier. Completing the 30 lessons is a steep and thorny road.In spite of these defects, this book is better than BREAKTHROUGHNAVAJO and its sequel INTERMEDIATE NAVAJO."
1,Worthless without the CDs and you cannot get them,I am sure the book would be fine if I had the CD's but the only ones available seem to be for$999.00. Do not bother buying the book. j
2,First thoughts of a new student,"I purchased the CDs first, not realizing that the printed book would not be included in the expensive audio package... so there was some serious frustration when I finally realized that another purchase (and wait) was necessary before the set of CDs could be used. The CDs alone are virtually useless, since the audio language lessons they contain don't have any English whatsoever and apparently rely on the textbook to explain the meaning of the phrases being spoken!Aside from that little clarification, I would concur with those other reviewers who note that classroom study, and/or cultural immersion with native speakers as guides, is really desirable for learning a language - especially one as unfamiliar to most English-speakers as is Navajo. This book and CD set probably does as well as one could hope, but it isn't - and can't be - ideal."
4,"Good on grammar, but limitted vocabulary","I bought this book at El Morro National Park for about the same price. I am enjoying it and it is a very good resource, except for the fact that there isn't a whole lot of vocabulary."
4,It seems to do it's job.,The dogs are older gentlemen and seemed to be feeling the weather. They easily take the pills as if they were treats and pain seems to be eased.
4,Gym Like Ride,"This bike is surprisingly stable ,smooth, and quiet. It is definitely a step above the equipment available at the larger retailers. The ride and programing are comparable to the bikes I use at the gym. My one concern is will it stand the test of time."
3,from Gordon Kahl to Randy Weaver,"TERROR ON RUBY RIDGE:WILL YOU BE NEXT? (1992)by Len MartinMartin has written several books about the late tax protester Gordon Kahl. This book compares the cases of Kahl and Randy Weaver. He examines the authority of the federal marshals and what the law says about their actions. In general it is well researched and contains a lot of useful information. There is a very thorough section where he shows how the government's version of the events changed over time. Unfortunately Martin couldn't resist the temptation to drop several pages on Zionism into the middle of the book... was this really necessary? I could've done without it personally. If I wanted a book on the subject, I wouldn't have bought a book on the Ruby Creek/Ruby Ridge incident!Recommended if you can get past the ""extras""."
1,Magnavox service is poor,"I bought a Magnavox HDTV for our home office as a computer screen and tv, but from the 1st month we had the picture going blank with sound. We'd turn it off for a few seconds, then turn it on again and get picture for 10 minutes. I took it to a service center recommended by Magnavox and paid $50 for them to tell me that they could not find a problem. I brought it home and it worked fine for about 6 months, now there is no picture at all, just sound. Magnavox told me to take it to another service center and they were not willing to help me except to direct me to pay someone else to look at it again. I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND this product because of poor service. Now we have a flat screen radio....Shame on you MAGNAVOX. This deserves no stars."
1,"This TV does not work, not worth the good deal","I didn't buy this from Amazon but I wanted to post a review. We got ours at Circuit City and either we got a Lemon or the TV is just made poorly. It worked great for the first few weeks and then I noticed that after watching for more than 2 hours the screen would go black. The Cable and everything else was fine but no picture. As the weeks went by it kept getting worse and worse in shorter amounts of time. Finally, my husband returned it to the store for a full refund. When we called Magnavox they told us we would have to ship it to them so they could refurbish it and we would have to pay for the shipping to Magnavox. Forget that, after paying good money for a product, it shouldn't break after 2 weeks of use. Buy a different TV, this one was extrememly disappointing :("
4,Good TV - BAD monitor,"I bought this remanufactured, but the problem is the same if you want to use as a monitor. Works great as tv - poor computer monitor. I ordered this to use as a monitor for my laptop and also has a tv. However, the ONLY computer resolution it can use is 800x600 which on a 19"" screen is way too grainy and made my eyes hurt. I discussed with Maganavox tech and admitted it was a problem. I returned and am now shopping for a computer monitor with tv tuner."
4,Word pictures to learn from,"Savour the humor, the impeccable references, the reality of the content, the clearly evolving Indian market identity and trends, the pedagocical applications, and most of all the writing that seems to have come straight from the heart. The book has many different layers that gets the attention of both newcomers and old hands and even people like me who are not in the business.The quality of the printing and especially the photographs - or rather the visuals - could be better. And beware of foreign words and phrases! They too need to be proof read."
3,ONE SIZE MEANS SMALL,"I love these hats, but my preemie twins were only able to wear them until they were 4 months old...and even then they had small heads. Wish they could have worn them through the winter."
4,Adorable but a little uncomfortable,"I got this hat because it matched the JJ Cole Bundle Me blanket for my son's car seat. He looks absolutely adorable in it, but he hates wearing it unfortunately. The elastic is a little bit tight and it smooshes his whole forehead down. Overall, if your baby is a hat-wearer and this fits him/her, then it's wonderful. It's warm, soft and is made very well."
2,"Too small, doesn't stretch","I bought this hat for my 6 month old and it did not fit. I'm surprised the 6-12 month size still turned out to be too small! I'll probably try the next size (12-24 months) and see if that works out better. Right now, just returned the hat."
3,alittle too tight,"Although this hat kept my baby warm, it seems to be alittle too snug around her head. She does not have a big head so I was suprised to see that it was alittle too snug on a 4 /12 month old, esp since the hat should fit a 6 month old. But it is a warm hat and does the trick. I may get a size up though."
3,No way is the 0-6 months,"Cute warm hat, very small.Was snug on my small 3-month old.I ended u using the iplay hat, which also covers his ears."
2,Too small for newborn,"It looks cute, but made of polyester which is not great for baby at all. And even worse - I couldn't fit it on my newborn's head. He's quite a big boy, but I'd expect that this hat would do its job at least for couple of months and I couldn't use it even once. Unfortunatly, haven't saved the packaging and can't return it:("
4,warm hat,"I was slightly disappointed at first because the hat was too big for my newborn baby. I wanted her to wear the hat as a part of her coming home outfit, sitting in her car seat with the matching jj cole bundle me bunting bag. However, because it was too large we will just have to wait until she grows a little bit more, so maybe in a few months we'll try it on again. This is fine anyway, because the harshest part of winter hasn't even begun yet."
3,runs very small!!!!,"the larger size is the only one worth buying. hat is extremely nice, but don't expect it to fit for long."
2,runs small,"Very good quality, but runs small. My daughter was small for her age, and it still did not fit her. I had to return it, which cost me almost as much at the hat."
2,Smaller than expected,"I have bought many JJ Cole products and have always been satisfied with their quality. This hat is no exception. The hat looks really cute, soft and warm. However, it's way smaller than I'd expected. I bought size 0-6months for my then 3 month old daughter, whose headsize was in the 5th percentile. It was tight on her head and I could tell that she was uncomfortable, she kept scratching her head as if trying to take the hat off. I'm not sure if it was tight because I washed it, or because that's how it came in. It was used only once and I had to put it away. Too bad I couldn't return it."
3,"Great hat, but sizes are off","This is a wonderful hat, but the sizes need to be remarked. We initially bought the 6-12 month size based on reviews about the sizing. It is entirely too large. We then bought this hat for our baby at 3 months. She is 4 months now, and it is too tight for her head (50th percentile head circumference). The hat is really for 0-3 months. If your kid is between 3-6 months, you are out of luck because there is not a size that fits."
2,Too small!!,"My 3 month old can't fit in this hat! It's super cute and soft, but for a tiny, newborn head!"
2,"Hat is too small, but cute",I bought the 0-6 month size and it's too small on my 3.5 month old. The hat looks like it's good quality. I will try the larger size and hope that it fits properly.
1,Way too small!!,"I was so excited to get this hat in for my 3 month old daughter. I ordered the 6-12 month size because I have read in other reviews that the hat runs small. My 3mo old has a normal size head for her age and I had to try to force it on her head as it doesn't stretch at all. Wouldn't recommend ordering this hat. It is super cute, but not cute enough to just sit on her dresser."
1,Runs VERY Small!,"We purchased this hat for our 6 month old in the 6-12 month size, but it didn't even fit! She is only in the 70th percentile for head size, so it's not that she's abnormally large. I like the hat, but I wish that it was either sized correctly, or had a larger size than 6-12 mos available."
2,Might work for some babies...,"My son was born in December. I had a HORRIBLE time finding a nice warm winter hat for a boy. I ordered this and have some mixed reviews. It's defiantly thick and warm. It's not super soft--but that's okay. It never really fit my son though. It's a 0-6 month hat and even in the early months it didn't fit. The ""band"" part was always too small and the rest of it stood up like an elf hat. My son's head at birth was in the 60 percentile. I'm not sure how this could fit many 6 month olds..."
2,Flawed,Baby hats can be a bit tricky. The depth of the hat is too long. It doesn't stretch in any way so it has to fit perfectly or it will slip over your baby's face or not fit at all. The design doesn't make sense to me. I would not recommend.
3,size doesn't fit but great REFUND!,This size is for 0-6 months but doesn't fit my 2 month old son. We are an asian family so my son has a bigger head than average. Amazon told me to keep the product and gave us an IMMEDIATE FULL refund for the product!
3,"JJ Cole Bundleme Shearling Baby Hat, 6 - 12 MonthsJJ Cole Bundleme Shearling Baby Hat, 6 - 12 Months",This is a really good quality hat and is really warm but unfortunately its on the smaller side. Even tho it says 6-12 months it does no fit our 8 months old baby. Maybe for babies with a smaller head this head would fit perfectly.
2,"Nice, but too small","Hat construction and material are nice, but hats are too tight for our twin 3 month old girls. They don't have particularly large heads, either, so I have no idea how this could be considered 0-6 month."
1,Don't waste your money,"This hat is, to put it plainly, horrible. My baby is 8 weeks old and his head is in the 25th percentile for circumference and my husband and I had to struggle to even get it on his head. Once we did have it on, sort of, we had to pull it down to his nose to fill it out. Needless to say we aren't keeping it."
3,Adorable but SMALL,This hat seems very thick and well made but unfortunately my son never got to wear it (unless you count the one time I crammed it on his head!) as it runs VERY small. It's listed as 6-12 months but my son was 7 months old and couldn't fit into it. Since the lower band is pretty sturdy it does not stretch or mold at all. So I immediately gave it to a friend with a 4 month old!
3,Sizing Issues,"I did look at the reviews and noted that there is a sizing issue but I took the risk of getting my 4-month old the 0-6 months. It was small and not stretchable (hope it was and would solve all mommy concerns!) so I returned and ordered the 6-12 months. Why, it still did not fit! I think I will keep but will need to make some stitching adjustments to it. It does look very warm and comfy."
3,Sizing is too small,"I ordered the 6-12 months hat for my daughter, who is 6.5 months old. The hat barely fits her. I can't expect she'll be able to wear it for long. She has a normal-sized head so I imagine most people don't get to use this hat for long into the 6-12 month period."
3,Runs small...,"My baby is only 11 weeks old and already the hat is really tight (and he does not have a huge head by any means).This is a problem because with their weak necks, you can't exactly force it on them. Until now, it worked well for us, but we won't be able to use it any longer :(However, the fabric is soft and it is super cute."
3,too small for 2 month old baby,i purchased this a month ago and was excited when i got it. the material is nice but too bad my 2 month old son wasn't able to use it. too small for his head and he's only 12 lbs. i suggest you buy the bigger size.
2,"Adorable, but too small","Had to return this item. It was way too small. Forewarned when you order that it won't fit an average baby up to six months. I would say it would fit up to 6 weeks at most!! It is very cute and would be a great addition to a Bundleme (cover), but the company needs to reanalyze their sizing. More disappointing was having to pay shipping return on a $9 item."
3,"Not at all ""One Size Fits All""","This hat is so cute - I just love it and couldn't wait to get it! But, small isn't the word for it. My son is 3 weeks old and it's too small. Somewhere in fairy tail land there are some pretty happy kebbler elves with warm little heads... lol... Other than it being so small - the quailty of the hat is great."
5,"i like it, it's the best","<< this is my first time to shop for my Baby boy, however, i liked this hat so much. it's good for the wenter"
4,cute look!,"Wanted a cute, warm hat for winter - this is it! It's a little big now but by the time it gets really cold, it should be perfect! Great price too!"
2,TOO TIGHT,"i bought this for my son who just turned 6 months, and i am not very happy with it, it is tight and bends his ears when i try to put it on. it says 6-12 but feels like it should be for 0-3 months. a waste of money.Thanks"
3,It will be cute when he grows into it...,"After reading the other reviews I purchesed the 0-6 month hat to match with the bundleme coverup because I had this image of it being so cute, even if only for a little while. There were so many complaints about it being too small I was expecting to have the same issue... wrong. There must be an overall sizing inconsistancy because the hat goes down to my little one's nose so he hasn't been able to wear it yet and he just turned 2 months old. He's not a small baby by any means, he was 8 pounds 7.9 ounces when he was born and now he's over 11 pounds. It is really cute though and I look forward to having him wear it once he grows into it."
1,The hat is so small,"I don't know who JJ Cole made this hat for, my daughter had the tiniest head and it still didn't fit. Waste of money!"
3,Did Not Work for Us,"Very sweeet hat, but was too small for our son at 4 months so we had to return it. Love the ""Bundle Me"" so if the hat came in other sizes I would have enjoyed having. (Probably would only fit most babies under 3 months)"
3,Too small,"Yep, it was too small, and i got the larger one. I wasn't worried after the reviews because my baby's head is only 25 percentile, but it was not stretchy at all. And i did follow the advice of one of the reviews to make it larger, but i ended up undoing the lining and got the fuzz everywhere. As cute as it is, ultimatly it wasn't worth it."
3,OK,"This hat is definitely not for a newborn, but wouldn't fit any baby over 4 months I've ever seen. It's very narrow, long and not at all stretchy. First it falls over their eyes and after it won't even stay on their head. You'll get about 2 weeks of wear out of this hat. Buyer beware."
1,Too thick and not flexible!,I bought this hat for my baby and did not find it to be a good product. It was too thick and did not have any give to get it on my baby's head!
1,"Too big, then too small","I bought the 0-6 months size for my newborn. For about a month, it was always falling in her face (which she hated). Then suddenly, It would fit her, but the bottom band is too small for her head! This hat is cute, it matches her bundleme and it's very warm and fluffy, but she can't wear it!What a waste."
4,Big,This hat is cute but the 0-6 moths size is way too big for my 2 month old baby girl. She might not even get a chance to wear it before the weather warms up again. It mostly just sits on the head her stuffed lamb that is made of the same exact material. Baby girl did look very cute coming home from the hospital though :)
2,Not sized properly,"This hat is appropriate for a 3 month to 6 month child. It would be too tight for an older child, would be better if band around head was elastic or more flexible."
2,Small!,I washed this as soon as I received it and now it doesn't fit my daughters head. She's only 3 months old and the size I got is for 0-6 months. What a waste of money :(
3,cute but tight,very cute hat- and warm. but extremely tight! my son is 3 months old and already grew out of the 0-6 mos size about a week ago.
2,size of jj cole baby hat,The size stated 3-6 months. The baby was 2 months old and the hat was too small. Anyone ordering should consider it runs very small. Then because I used my credit card to purchase it I was unable to return it and get a refund.
3,Bad Sizing,The hat is very cute & warm. However the sizing is off. It's very tight on my 2 month old. I've tried to stretch it out but still she'll only be wearing it a short while.
2,Too tight,Either my baby has a huge head or these hats run way too small. And I've bought two (different sizes) of these!
2,"Cute, but very, very tight","I love the look and feel of this hat, but my five-month old baby's normal sized head gets squeezed very tightly by it. I'm still trying to figure out how to stretch it out without ruining it. I should have listened to the other reviews that also mentioned how tight this hat is."
3,Runs small,"This hat ran very smal, even for a hat to fit a child 6 -12 months, that's a large span of time, It should have been sized ""small:"
2,it's ok,"this product it is ok, but from 6 months and up.cover until my newborn neck.material and quality are ok."
3,"Really soft, poorly sized","I bought this hat for my 4 month old son, I can hardly fit this on his head right now and was wanting something he could grow into. The poor sizing is a big deal to me, though it is very soft."
1,"Too small, sizing is terrible!!!!","Saw this hat and fell in love with it for my three month old daughter. I bought the 0-6mo. Tried hat on her and she started to cry, because it was too tight on her head. And she is a preemie! Do not want to send it back because of the shipping cost. So I decided I will keep the hat and cut a small slit on the back of it(but not all the way up, because then it won't stay on her head)just so I can at least feel like I got my monies worth. I am disappointed!!!"
4,Nice Bread Warmer,"I purchased two of these Keilen Bread Warmer Baskets in anticipation of holiday meals this year. I used them at Thanksgiving and they worked very well. The stones were easy to heat in the microwave, and they held heat through dinner. Next time I will place paper napkins inside the basket over the cloth napkin, and save a little laundry!! (Actually, they laundered beautifully and are colorfast.) I recommend these, but if you are having a large gathering you might want more than one."
4,Keep bread warm with stone!,"The stone insert was an excellent design. It's easy to use (stick the stone in the oven with your bread), and your bread stays warm on the table for a long time! I love this."
1,Item pictured not what I recieved,"The item I ordered was not what I received, which was dissapointing. Also, it took several weeks to get here so I didn't have time to return it because it was a gift. I specifically picked this item of the many available to buy because of the picture....very dissapointing."
5,Perfect!,"This is a great product! The basket is really nice. Not just a plain basket. Although, I guess it doesn't matter when you put the red cloth in it. Bought it for a friend and liked it so much I bought one for myself. Then my Grandma and Great Grandma saw it and liked it so much that I decided I better buy them one too."
2,Unbiased?,"I just watched this and although it is interesting I have to ask myself if it is really unbiased? The majority of opinions come from freemasons themselves. The whole point of this show was to prove all the theories wrong using people who disagree with these theories. Although the narrator does bring up the theories, he does not have any opinions to back them up. The conspiracy theories may be garbage but this show is biased garbage as well. Something seems to be happening to a lot of history channel programs."
2,Funny?,Nice vidoe but....Does it really tell us the truth about Masons .I think No.It's just gives us history of freemasons and that's all.Come'on Freemasons filming about freemasons will they give all the secrets no it's just cover up.This Item is good for people who are interested in mainstream Mason history not the actual one anyway the choice is yours.....
1,It didn't work,"I tried to watch it from my ipad, it didn't work. I am not happy with it and probably will delete it."
2,old fashioned,We didnt realize that this dvd set would be so old fashioned. It was pretty boring and not very exciting for our little one. Thee was nothing wrong with the product though. No complaints with delivery just content was not what we were expecting.
1,What product??????,"Please tell me how I can review a product I didn't receive. I understood that I was ordering this as a download for my 2-year-old. I can't view or rate an imaginary item! Thanks, Amazon! I'll wire you some imaginary funds to cover this!"
2,It i not as much interaction with elmo,"Hi! Overall I like Elmo however, the season does not have as much interaction with Elmo, as I was hoping because is how my daughter get entertain."
3,Not what I was expecting,Warning! Amazon pictures the Acera model RD-M340-L in their listing but the model I received was the RD-M360-L. This was not the derailleur that I wanted. I will be sending it back to Amazon.
2,broke in under a year,"If I wrote my review shortly after installing as many of the other reviewers did, I could give 5 stars too-- it works fine in the beginning! Mine is no longer holding chain tension after less a year of use on a Yuba Mundo cargo bike. I plan to replace it soon with a higher grade component."
4,Works fine.,"Good derailleur, i messed up while installing it and now it works fine. Be sure to have a long enough chain."
1,Item Shipped is not the Short Cage in the picture,"Received the product and it is a medium cage, not the short cage which would have been a direct replacement."
4,Unique wedding cake design ideas.,"I enjoyed many of the off-beat ideas for wedding cakes in this book. Some of them are not very practical for the everyday wedding couple, but that being said, I sold two cakes based on photos from this book within the first week of purchasing it! Paid for itself already. Good directions for creating each of the styles shown."
3,Disappointed,"This book only has three boy hair cuts to choose from. The instructions seem clear but the haircuts only include a buzz, a traditional layered and a wedge cut. If I needed instructions for a simple buzz cut I would just take him into the barber! I'm disappointed."
4,great book,Love it! Much better than another one I got before this. Very precise and helpful all the way through the cut. I just wish it had more choices for boys' cuts.
3,Not worth the money,"I bought Pina Zangaro portfolio case (16.25x20.25x1.875 )and got it today. The latches seem somewhat thin and the handle is too small for a normal sized person. Mainly, it just did not seem solid/study/strong/pretty enough for $161 plus shipping.I was thinking of getting a Tenba but that was huge. Prat cases are flimzy. I tell ya, there does not seem to be many good options out there for graphic design portfolio cases that both practical in size (few 16x20s), looks, durability etc."
2,"Good features, good-looking watch, but BAD worksmanship","I bought this watch about 4 years back from Service Merchandise. The alarm button fell off within three weeks! I've never worn this watch after that, since the outlet I bought it from told me the only way to repair it would be to ship it back to Timex, and I just didn't feel it worthwhile to incur the time and cost of packing and shipping it and then dealing with customer service; however, since everything else was working I've used it ever since as a little desk watch."
2,BEZEL FELL OFF,"After owning this only 6 months, the bezel fell off. I use it only for office wear. I use another watch for rough usage (ie. water sports, biking, etc). Up until the bezel fell off, I was very happy with it. I really like the indigo feature which allows me to see the time at night."
2,"Disappointed: nice features, but not sturdy","The easy-to-set alarm deserves high praise. Just turn the bezel (the rotating ring around the face) and easily set the alarm to go off within a one-hour or 12-hour timeframe. I wish other manufacturers offered something similar, because I've lost confidence in Timex quality. Within a year of owning the watch, the bezel fell off after a minor bump. I was able to snap it back on, but it no longer turned smoothly and the bezel began to fall off on a regular basis. Eventually it fell off without my noticing and was lost. Since others appear to have had the same experience, I cannot recommend the watch."
1,"This watch falls apart - easily, and without hard use...","You'll want to avoid this one -- it falls apart(bezel falls off, buttons easily exposed andcatch on things in annoying ways)... thereare better ways to spend your money than this.The design engineers were asleep at thewheel with this one !"
3,Great features poor durability,I bought this watch because it was analog and easy to set. I work an odd schedule so have diffuculty remembering the day. The date is awful small for us over 40 folks as well. I love the easy to set timer. Just spin the dial. No multiple buttons to push and no 26 language instruction sheet to wade thru. Unfortunately my dial fell off and I returned it to walmart and got a replacement. ON this watch the bezel has lost its color and the indiglo has lost its brightness so I cannot read the watch at night. As a professional firefighter EMT I need to see the time and second hand on the watch. Definitely want another but wish it was tougher.!
5,Highly Recommended!,"For the second time in her life, Cyn Porter is ready for a fresh start. She's headed for Visitation, NC - a town she chose from a map. Bruce Kelly, who followed in his twin brother Bryan's footsteps and settled in Visitation, sees a woman in trouble and does his best to help. With her less-than savory background, Cyn is an unlikely match for preacher Bruce but the two seem to bring out the best in each other.Difficult subjects are handled beautifully in this engrossing story. Cyn?s life has been difficult, but she?s tough and strong, ready to stand up to every challenge. Bruce is compassionate, supportive, and never judgmental. It was fun to revisit characters from other books in this series, including the mysterious Jamie Creed, who plays his biggest role yet. Suspense, steam, an intriguing plot and deep characters all contribute to a thoroughly enjoyable story."
4,Cyn finds his heaven,"'When Bruce met Cyn' by Lori Foster is the part of the series about small NC town. Bruce is a preacher who ran a halfway house for prostitutes and is now starting his own church near his twin brother. Cyn had an abusive childhood and working as prostitute to find peace and a real live. This novel like all Lori Foster novels has a seeding mystery, great romance and small alpha males. Enjoy!"
4,Absolutely loved it!,"Out of all the men that Lori Foster has written about, Bruce has to be the most compassionate and gentle. I loved the way the he held on to his faith and did the right thing for himself and Cyn, and after years of abuse, I'm glad that she was very receptive."
5,Loved it,I love this series.. This book was fun to read finished it one day. I love Lori Fosters books I've read almost all of them.
1,"Unbelievable, disappointing, and at times horrifying...","The review by S. Thomas ""sktca"" in which she states the book was ""Facile, unrealistic, silly"" was right on! As she so succinctly points out the unrealistic storyline is at times horrifying to read. That this paragon of virtue Preacher Bruce could overlook and embrace Cyn's past was unbelievable at best and colossally unrealistic at worst. And since the previous review underlines my exact thoughts on this book I won't repeat. However, I too put this book down MANY times in disgust and in fact read several other books in between sessions and only finished this one out of desperation until I could get to the library. What a disappointing waste of time that I won't ever get back..."
2,Disappointed...,"What has happened to the fun/sexy writer that Lori Foster once was? Reading about the preacher and his lustful desires for the good-at-heart hooker didn't do it for me. In fact, it's kind of turned me off to the rest of the series. May I recommend Kasey Michaels if you want a fun, funny and sexy read."
1,Implausible!,"I bought this thinking it sounded 'hot'. I almost got the impression that while 'Bruce' was a minister he was also way too old for 'Cyn'. She being 22 and he 35ish. Just couldnt buy that premise. What a disappointment! Well, the 'top reviewers' liked it?????"
2,NO WAY!!!,"I loved this series, until this book. I don't understand what people found amazing about it.It's so unrealistic!!! A 35 years old preacher falls for a 22 year old prostitute, who has been off the streets for one day.She was honest, well spoken,didn't have a drug problem,was sweet and worked for herself. If that was the case why wasn't she working some other job for five years?The point is this, a real prostitute has many reasons why she can't get out of that life, even if they want to.This book's description of the life of a prostitue was horrible.Also, I found Cyn extremely ungrateful at times. People were trying to help her, such as Shay, and she acted horrible.I just could not understand why Bruce fell for her."
5,Warm,This a warm jacket. I think it will be just what I need on those cold nights at work. I'm looking forward to trying it out.
5,carhartt,"great coat my last one i had for 12 years and still have it,had to get a bigger one because of weight gain wouldn't think of owning anything else,the last one i purchased in alaska and never got cold even at minus 30 with windchills down to minus 65,GREAT PRODUCT!!!"
3,Carhartt Men's Arctic-Quilt,"Owned three of these over the years.watched many hockey games in Canada, and Northern NY. Cut wood worked out doors all winter worked on snow making and ice rinks with them. When cuffs get frozen they fray and go to a worn out rag look. Yes they fade and loose a lot of there water repellent and wind resistance ability with every washing. But I do not think there is another coat as tough. Buy large and wear allot of under garments when it is real tough out side."
5,Love it!,"You just know this coat is the best when you open the package! Heavy duty, warm, and great color! I also ordered the A148 hood and I'm ready for whatever cold weather conditions that come my way."
5,Son is very happy with this jacket.,I purchase for my son at Christmas and he was very happy with this jacket.
4,Carhartt Men's Artic-Quilt Coat,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT BUT MY SON WAS LOOKING FOR A SHORTER COAT FOR WORK. HE HAS SINCED RETURNED THE COAT AND WILL REORDER A SHORTER VERSION.
5,Good choice,Coat fits and wears great. Has a lot of pockets and I like the zipper and velcro closures. Great quality coat!
1,Don't work well,This sensor says that works on a Civic 01 but no. It doesn't turn off the check engine light. Even the picture is not the same like real.
4,Great value,"I ordered the 11.5 gram set of 500 suited chips from PokerGoods with free shipping. I received the set with dice-design chips, which I think are from the same manufacturer, and probably use the same chip blank. I almost ordered this design anyway, so did not return. As for the weight, I checked on a postal scale, and the chips weigh 11.5 grams as advertised. They are heavy and solid feeling, but have a little more plastic ring when they hit the table than real casino chips, but for the money these are really good quality. My sizes were all the same, and the case is a little flimsy,but secure enough to hold chips with no problem. Nicer than I expected from the reviews, and when full, surprisingly heavy, like if it were filled with rocks."
2,I was disappointed,"I ordered this set for a Super Bowl get together. Ordered them with one-day shipping to arrive on time. Fed Ex didn't get them here on the day expected so they arrived the day after the game. Oh well. I opened the box to find what appeared to be a very sturdy aluminum case. But upon opening the case I found what another reviewer did: The chips are not equal size. No tragic. Just awkward. But what really turned me off was the interior of the case. The padding was ripped, when brand now. The case slots for chips were extremely cheaply formed. I can't imagine what it would look like in a year.If this is a set you might use once a year then it's ok because the chips ARE a ok weight. Just don't expect them to feel top quality.But if this used with any frequency I suspect there will be ""slightly mis-sized"" chips flying everywhere when the entire case fails. Sorry, butno fault to Amazon, but I returned my set to order one with a higher quality build."
2,not the chips I ordered,Fast shipping which was good. But these are not the chips I ordered nor were they the chips in the picture above. I I was under the impression that these were dice style chips and they weren't so they didnt match my other sets. Disappointed to say the least.
4,Loved,"I loved this set! The poker chips are great, great quality. The card were a lot more flimsy than I thought they'd be, but I just went out and bought a new deck of cards. But this set is great!"
1,Don't believe it!,The shipping weight is listed as 8.35 pounds.11.5 grams * 500 chips = 5.75 kilograms = 12.65 pounds > 8.35 pounds.If the listed shipping weight is anywhere close to accurate the chips can't possibly be 11.5 grams. The most they can be is about 7.5 grams each.
3,Easily bent latches on case,"I purchased these chips three months ago and have been using them about once a week ever since. The chips themselves seem fine. Today, however, I noticed that one of the latches which holds the case closed was bent and no longer latched properly. I bent it back into shape, but it's distressing how easily the piece bends out of and in to the correct shape. If you plan on traveling with these chips, beware that the case is not sturdy."
4,nice budget composite chip set,"For the price, the chips are excellent. Don't know if they are regulation weight, but they feel, sound and play nicely. The set is quite heavy, (13 lbs total shipping weight) the case, handle and locks are a bit flimsy considering the weight of the chips. Fortunately, I won't be doing any traveling with them. Just use care if you have to carry them about. Probably unnecessary, but I lock the latches of the case for added peace of mind. The chips get 5 stars, but case only gets 3."
3,An ok chip for starters,"It is an okay poker chips set for an occasional game at home. Although the case handle looks like it was going to break, but I doubt if it does. The company probably tested it first. For 30 buck, you can't go wrong."
3,"Chips are great, Case is cheaply made",The chips are great. The case was very cheaply made. The clasps don't stay latched right. Luckily they lock so if I keep them locked they don't come open. But I am happy for the price I paid.
1,"Waste of money, deceptive","Other than being a conversation piece, this unit is completely useless if you have real 1/4"" reel to reel tapes. This unit is a glorified cassette recorder, just uses cassette tape on open reels. So you cannot play your vintage 1/4"" tapes and cannot record and share your recordings with those that have real 1/4"" 4 track stereo tape machines. You can only play these recordings on this model of tape machine, nothing else. Why this was brought to market makes no sense."
4,Only a Prayer Meeting,"As I have tried to lead our church to be a praying church, I have looked for books that both informed and challenged me as pastor.I was both informed and challenged as I read Spurgeon's chapters on messages he gave to his congregation when they came to prayer time. His emphasis was to lead people to open their hearts before the Lord God in a humble attitude.As you look at his comments in his messages, you see how people a hundred years ago are so much like modern people today.The request of the disciples to Jesus was ""teach us to pray."" People of all ages need to be taught to pray in every generation.Only A Prayer Meeting was helpful in teaching me how to pray more biblically and in turn to teach others to pray more effectively."
4,Personal,"IT'S FUNNY WHEN LISTEN TO THIS PARTICULAR ALBUM, AND GOOD FEELING I GET FROM IT.MY FIRST TIME I HEARD ANY OF GH STUFF WAS ON HIS STEPPIN OUT ALBUM, THEN REFLECTIONS WITH THE SONG ""ONE LOVE"" JOHNNY GILL SANG. AT A TIME WHEN I WAS DEFENDING MY COUNTRY, LISTENING TO ANY OF GEORGE'S MUSIC ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL ALMOST YOUNG AGAIN. GOD BLESSED US ALL WHO WERE FORTUNATE TO HEAR HIS MUSIC,AND MY HEART HURT WHEN I HEARD OF HIS PASSING. SO MANY BEAUTIFUL SOUNDS THAT WOULD NOT BE CREATED, MAY YOU REST IN PEACE GEORGE HOWARD AND YOUR MUSIC LIVE FOREVER."
1,Not for children...,"I had purchased this as a gift for my daughter's teacher to share with the class. The content, however, is not age appropriate for that use."
1,Boring Book,I thought this book would provide funny questions but the questions were stupid. Would I rather leave a trail of paprika wherever I go or have moving eyebrows? Who cares...don't get this book.
1,I shoulda believed the naysayers!,Juvenile- at a grade school level. I shed a tear some tree had to die to publish this book.
2,disappointing,"We played an impromptu game of ""Would you rather..."" at a party and we each made up our own dilemmas. Some were thoughtful such as ""Would you rather be blind or have no hands? Others were more odd like ""Would you rather have no tastebuds or lick peanut butter off a hobo's feet? I was hoping the book would be a good party game and would spark some conversation. Unfortunately, so many of the suggested dilemmas in the book were too sexy, too political, or too obscure. I read through it and then threw it away. We'll be better off making up our own."
1,absurd but not funny,"Not at all funny. The 'dilemmas' range from gross to just stupid. For example, would you rather eat a pound of raw bacon or take a bath in bile? Would you rather be hole-punched to death or eaten alive? Would you rather have porkchops for earlobes or Magic 8-balls for elbows? Simply stupid. Not even thought-provoking, much less funny. I guess the authors were out for an easy buck, but I wish I hadn't contributed even one cent."
5,I personally love this book!,"The first time I found this book, I was in a Barnes & Noble with a bunch of my friends. At first, we were all standing up, but soon we were sitting on the ground and I think we read through a good portion of the book! I'm surprised that they didn't kick us out of the bookstore, we were laughing so hard! While I absolutely adore this book, I can see how it might not appeal to certain people's sense of humor... I guess. I agree with the person who said that people NOW think they are funny, because I do that too! It kind of spices up the conversation. I don't know how to explain it, but when you say, ""would you rather have fangs or a forked tongue?"" 99% of the time people will laugh! My friend and I made up our own too! Whenever I read it, it sparks my imagination. For me, (this is going to sound corny but) it has added something to my life. HUMOR!"
1,You'd rather not buy this,"This really is not funny or thought-provoking. Dumb examples from pop culture -- way too many. People didn't like it when used recently at a birthday party, and we abandoned it all together in favor of a much funnier, crowd-engaging version of this game: the Zobmondo Book of Outrageous Choices."
4,"Wonderful fun, an entertaining alternative to T.V.","I loved this book! I gave it four stars because it has some content not suitable for children. Otherwise, it made me roll on the floor laughing hysterically and gave me some good things to ponder."
2,I would rather have my money back,This book is disappointingly lame. The authors are so intent at coming off as zany and wacky that they sabotage any hope of expressing a genuinely compelling question. Gregory Stock's BOOK OF QUESTIONS and its sequels are 100 times more intriguing & fun. They also only cost half as much.
1,You've got to be kidding me,This book is just not funny. I don't get it. How does something like this get published?
5,This is the most hilarious book I have ever read!,"This book is so funny, it brought tears to my eyes. The authors are the most creative people i have ever encountered in my life! I will read everything and anything that they ever write for the rest of my life!"
1,"Excellent example of the words ""salacious"" and ""vulgar""","If you happen across a copy of this book, don't let your child look at it. It is entertaining only if you are pleased with language of the ""gutter""."
2,you call yourself a blythe?,"Ok, the Ashton Drake Blythe repro dolls look nothing like the original Kenners, they are just way off. They look snobby/mean and have a greenish tint to their skin...weird. If you want a Blythe, but don't want the outrageously priced originals on ebay, go for the japanese Takara neo blythes. They dont exactly look like the originals, but they are totally adorable just the same. If I knew then what I know now, I would have never purchased the Ashton Drake Gallery Medevil mood blythe, and trust me that one actually is an improvement over Golden Godess."
2,Unhappy with this one.,"Reading a fairy tale within the pages of a novel just doesn't work for me. Also, the main character was not likeable.I didn't care about anyone in this book and although the author seemed to be using the fairy tale written by the main character's mother as a means to pull the reader in, for me, the method failed and the ""mystery"" was not very intriguing."
3,Not so good,"This book is not so very well written, apart from the fairy tales spaced throughout it. The story is forced, and the psychological development too shallowly described."
4,Quality prints of two goodies at bargain price,"In RAW DEAL fall guy, Dennis O'Keefe is a wanted man: wanted by a blonde (Claire Trevor complete with voice over), a brunette (the luscious Marsha Hunt), a VERY big bad guy (Raymond Burr) who likes to torture using lots of heat - a cigarette lighter, a pot of boiling coffee, anything hot and handy will do really. But if that is not enough, O'Keefe is also wanted by the entire police forces of four states! Like all good noir he gets it in the guts but he leaves a few bodies behind and two mourning women. With dialogue up to scratch, terrific acting, ok music and some brilliant photography - lovers of close ups ahoy! - this is one noir to own. PLUS a second movie by the director, not quite as good, but better than most."
3,"Cute, lightweight - but probably not durable","It has the looks of stoneware and is lighweight as it's a melamine-like material. When I used this first time I served Jalapeno-poppers in this and everyone praised it. However, it never made it to the dishwasher. I don't know if it cracked from the heat of the food, or any of my guests did something. Anyway, I am buying one more because I liked it's look and feel very much, and it's a good brand - and inexpensive. I hope this one will last."
3,Plastic,"There was nothing in the listing for this that indicated it was made from some fairly shoddy plastic. I suppose the price should have been a clue, but I was honestly expecting stoneware or a reasonably sturdy and attractive material. I'll use it, or give it as a gift, but I am not impressed, and feel it should have been clearly stated that it is PLASTIC."
3,Disappointing,"The book is well produced and almost all of pictures in color.However the small format, 5 x 7.5, makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to see details of the animal illustrated. In addition, there a number of fairly common fish from the U.S. not mentioned in the book."
4,"""Little"" Big Book","This book is small in height, but one of the largest information books on the specific subject of ""fossil"" fishes I have ever seen. You just have to hunt around in the index for the specific fish you are looking for...Judy GoldbergPhiladelphia, PA"
3,Go to the source-- don't waste your time with this book!,"While this is a pretty good book, I must say that just going to [a website], [and] downloading the 14 day trial (full software version with an expiration date if you decide not to buy), and use the 320 page User's Manual that comes with the download is a better idea. The User's Manual is actually very good-- every bit as good as this book ...which is just another way for Pendragon to advertise itself and rake in a little extra cash. If you are just getting this for yourself (I am a field biologist with no need to publish my created form) then the ... price tag is worth it."
5,Great!,"Children love this story. I've used it in my Kndg. Classroom for years, either to talk about the letter B, or when we were making elephants. I was so happy to find it again for my niece, who is going into early education, and will be doing her teaching next semester. I gave her a library for her 21st birthday, and Bill's Belly Button is among the books I added to the Bb books!"
2,not exactly like the sunday drive-in movies of the past,i was looking for the old sunday drive-in movie types and picked up this movie because it had shaolin in it's title. i do not recommend it. i definitely recomend the five deadly venoms and the return of the five deadly venoms; as well as the drunken master with jackie chan. the venom movies are classic sunday drive-in movies and the drunken master is recent.
1,My dog is not so fond of NutriSauce,"I bought this product because I could get free shipping and save over the price of VitaGravy. It does not smell so great to me and for the first time, my dog is leaving kibble in his bowl."
2,"Eh, try something else...","There were few songs on this CD I will listen to again, most I didn't even listen to all the way the first time. If you are looking for Russian music, which is usually really good, I recommendThe Rough Guide to the Music of Russia.Colors of the World rarely gets things right... the only one I have liked was Celtic. The 'Rough Guide to' series does a much better job of compiling a good selection of world music.There are 14 songs on this CD, so not bad, the quality is all right but the sound is very volatile (gets very loud suddenly)."
2,Maybe okay for travel,"I was looking for basic arabic, so I could converse with my Arabic-speaking in-laws. This didn't really fit the bill. It's definitely oriented towards traveling (getting a hotel, etc) in an Arabic speaking country. It moves a little fast and expects you to jump right into conversation! Its probably a good way to become familiar with the 'sounds' of the language, though. I'll keep working on it!"
3,Good course but . . .,"First of all, as an introduction, I come from a language in which Arabic script is native and have also taken 3 yrs. of Arabic in school. Now, since a long time had passed and I wanted to re-learn spoken/Written Arabic, I have picked up this and the Teach Yourself course.Well, I have started this cassette pack initially so here is its review: A. It is a very nice way to learn Arabic fast. B. The problem with both these courses is that surprisingly, the authors somehow cannot pronounce some letters correctly. e.g. Saa is pronounced as taa So, Isnain is spoken/written as itnain and Salaasa as Talata.Well, as I already knew Arabic much more than learning the basics before this course, that was not a problem for me but if you are just starting out, remember, this is some dialect which may not be spoken other than some regions!Other than that quirk (Which has made me to think of returning it several times!), it may be a good course, hence the three stars!"
3,"Break Out, to where?","Break Out has a strong soul flavor, which a lot of vocal tracks. The best song is ""Got Soul"" which sounds instantly familiar (if they're copying someone else's song they do a great job). The other vocal songs are okay. The instruments, though, are lacking on this album. There isn't much to keep it interesting, save for some sharp horn lines. It's easy to believe these songs would be great heard live in a sweaty club and the volume turned up to 'earthquake'. This CD just isn't very compelling."
3,Soulive has to be live to be truly enjoyed,"As with so many other bands Soulive is best seen and heard live. This is a decent studio release but it does what all studio discs do...freeze dries the music, much as you might can peaches. This is what they want you to think the definitive version of the music is? I understand an artists need to get in the studio and immortalize their works, but the true value of music is its ability to constantly reinvent itself, which can only happen in the live enviornment. Improvise, expand, suprise. (...)"
3,Where's the energy?,"Although an excellent album, this is by no means Soulives best studio recording. The production value is tight and crips, but most songs on the album lack the steaming energy of previous albums, or live performances. All the key elements are there - the funk, thick beats, great musical performances - but somehow this one fails to ""take-off"". Worth owning if you are a fan, but novices might want to try pervious recordings to see what this group is really capable of - Doin' Something, Next, Soulive (self titled), etc."
4,In addition,"To add to what Chris stated this is the type of album you can throw on at a party and let it play. In addition to the quest appearances that Chris mentioned, Robert Randolph and Ivan Neville also appear on multiple tracks and really add to the funk and rock aspects of the album. Randolph is featured prominently on a cover of cross town traffic that is in a word, awesome. Also, the bass player for soulive is as good as I have heard in a long time."
2,A disappointing effort.,"Let's be honest: this is not a great Soulive CD. It isn't even a particularly good one. This is especially disappointing if, like me, you've grown to really like this band and know what they're capable of doing. With few exceptions the instrumentals are weak and uninspired. They simply weren't trying very hard on this one folks, and it shows. There's so little rhythmic variation among some of the tracks I wonder why they bothered to stop one tune and start the next, since the objective seems to be a kind of stupifying mid-tempo modal continuum. The unmemorable vocals are too numerous and mostly sound like quickly-prepared filler material. Overall there's simply precious little of the originality and fire for which Soulive is deservedly known. You have to wonder who let this one out the door. I'm just glad I downloaded it (legally) at emusic.com instead of paying ordinary retail. If after reading this you still want it, I strongly suggest you do the same."
2,the title doesn't reflect the content,"This little book is a disappointment.Not a lot of ideas, not enough pictures. And who is the so-called ""style maker,"" Christy Ferer? Has anyone heard of her?"
3,Creative Freedom,"JT does a fine job on this album. Its sort of Adult Contemporary meets R&B, with a lemon twist of Euro Pop. An intersting blend, if you ask me, and a lot different (in general), than what you'd hear from his work with Kool and the Gang. It's worth a listen. I bought it because I'm interested in the artist's ability and willingness to ""bare"" himself on a solo project -I like to hear what an artist is trying to say...outside excessive industry or band/group control or influence."
4,Saxophonic - amazing,I think this is one of his greatest CD's. There are songs on this CD that I can listen to over and over again. It was well worth the wait.
1,more schmaltz from the soap star,"I had to listen to this CD as part of my job as a music reviewer for a Florida newspaper.It's unfortunate to see a generation of sax players such as this guy who are more concerned with appearance than substantive playing. This music is all about fluff and ultimately says nothing. Having seen Dave in concert both as a lead man and a side man it is clear he has some sort of need to be in the limelight but when gets there has nothing to say. I'm not knocking all contemporary players mind you. There are guys like Jeff Kashiwa and Eric Marienthal that manage to play in the contemporary idiom and don't resort to trivial, fluffy playing."
1,always Been a Kenny G Clone at Best,"I remember Dave Koz on Arsenio hall's Show 10 years back blowing&whatnot&nothing moved me then.and fast forward a Decade later he still gives you that Creamy,Non-Descriptive,Ex-lax way of playing Muzak.more shine than Sun in His overall presentation.a Built in Formula."
1,A GREATER DISAPPOINTMENT SINCE THE LAST ALBUM,">well actually I waited this album since the last album THE DANCE.. I thought this album would be better than the album but the genre is more to artificial type .. he is a good smooth jazz saxophonist that I admired most ! What I can say is "" greater disappointment for this album ! I wish he can do better !"
3,Koz Magic went Missing a Bit !!!,"On the onset this CD didn't impress me, as I was expecting the same - if not more, of the kind of magic that made 'The Dance' and 'Lucky Man' etc. such great albums. This one unfortunately seemed to lack a bit of that magic. It's not that its 'bad' - its just that I was expecting more- given the exceptionally high standards of his previous albums. My first impression was exactly as one of the other reviewer's ie. it seemed as if Dave was just ""fulfilling his recording contract"". After listening to it in my car several times, I've grown to enjoy it somewhat- but still not as much as his previous works. Some great vocals on the tracks ""Love Changes Everything"" &""Definition of Beautiful"". If you're an avid Dave Koz fan like me, get it. If you just getting into smooth jazz and want something really spunky by this artist, then I would recommend 'The Dance' anytime."
5,A masterpiece,I love this cd..I must of checked it out from the library 5 times before I brought it its that good.
5,Saxophonic,"The music is classic. Whether your 20 something, 30 something or older, the sounds will please even the most distinguished penchant.Saxophonic"
2,Disappointment,"I'm one of Dave Koz's biggest fans, and I have to admit this album left me wanting my $15 back. He played some of these same songs in his concert a few weeks ago, and I said to myself I hope that the CD contains better songs than this! It doesn't. Dave's music has slowly waned since his huge debut album. Now his songs sound like he's trying to emulate other current pop styles. It's not the Dave Koz music like I used to know. I guess Dave might call it ""growing."" But hey, still go see him in concert if you get a chance. He puts on one helluva show!"
1,"What happened to the magic, Dave?","Wow! I am a fan of Dave Koz, and have 4 of his albums. He is one of my favorite musicians because he writes or co-writes most of his material and his music is filled with emotion (mostly joy) and wonder.This cd, however, seems mechanical as if Dave was just ""fulfilling"" his recording contract. For example, all of the songs in the ""Act I"" have no discernable melody and sound like Dave is just playing random notes on the sax while canned ""muzac"" plays in the background. Most of the cd is sterile, unimaginative, and devoid of emotion, and sounds way too polished--as if the band phoned in their performances from distant locations.Buy ""The Dance"" or ""Off The Beaten Path"", or either of his excellent holiday cds instead and experience the magic that is Dave."
3,Not what I would have expected .....,"All of dave koz previous cd's where great but when i heard this one it seems like most of the music is random sax playing just so he could fill up the cd "" Honey Dipped"" "" All I see is you"" and "" One last Thing "" are the songs that make the cd sell,the rest is just there so there could be more than 3 songs"
5,The Koz Is Back!,"I was beginning to worry whether or not Dave Koz still had his chops. After all, how do you top The Dance? It wasn't looking good. He took a 4 year hiatus from making new music, and I was worried what kind of effect that would have. Well, I'm happy to report that Dave Koz's music is still kicking, and the party has begun. Once again, Dave has outstanding guest artists making contributions to his CD. (Brian Culbertson, Chris Botti, Brian McKnight, Jeff Lorber, and others.) This is not your standard smooth jazz fare. One of my favorite tunes is the retro-like ""Sounds of the Underground"" with Chris Botti on trumpet. This tune is way to hip for commercial radio. Another favorite is ""All I See Is You"", co-written and performed with Brian Culbertson.DK knows how to balance the funky with the mellow. The ballads he plays are slower tempo and emotional without being boring. Listen to ""I Believe"", and you can hear DK's passion in every note.The Koz is back!"
5,Not Enough Stars for this CD,"I have listened to jazz Cd's by many artists, from Cannonball Adderley and Stan Getz to David Sanborn, Boney James and Richard Elliot, as well as all of Dave Koz's CD's. Nowhere have I heard a CD that was so diverse with so much stuff packed into it. Dave takes us on a grand tour of musical genres, from smooth jazz to hip-hop, pop rock, slow ballads, and swing. ""Sound of the Underground"" is the highlight of this CD. It is Dave's take on Lee Morgan's ""Sidewinder,"" which combines swing with record scratching. All of these songs are the best I've heard in a long time, and this is one of the best CDs ever."
2,NOT UP TO STANDARDS,I usually like to listen to Dave Koz and have seen him live in concert 3 times. I didn't care for the music on this CD at all. I have 4 other CDs by Dave Koz and they are great. This one really falls down.
4,Great educational product!,"As an early childhood educator, I know the importance of early literacy skills. My 6 year old daughter uses these magnets to make up her own silly sentences. I would recommend this for kindergarten-1st grade, for preschoolers it will be too frustrating and for older children it will be too easy. I like the variety of words. I rated the durability somewhat low because it would be rather easy to bend the magnet and break it (this has happened before to us with another set), but with a child 5 years old or older you should be able to explain to them not to do that. Yet another reason why this wouldn't work so great with preschoolers - they may just tear them apart!"
5,Great for emerging reader,I bought these for my son when he was almost 5. We have had a lot of fun with them. I put together sentences for him to read and discover and he has also proudly constructed his own silly sentences. Ages 4 to 6 seems to be the right target group for these.
5,For your budding reader,Make reading fun and buy this. Great way to engage your little one as they learn new words. I bought one for my kid and an extra for my friend's kids.
4,Very Interesting,"This is a great book to browse. It is a multinational effort with editors from 5 countries, and contributors from 8 countries. I would go so far as to say it has a UK slant. For example, if you look up ""crib death"" you are referred to ""cot death"". Some topics don't mention the USA at all. On the topic of death certificates, there is only information about death certificates in the UK. There are 2 indexes and a bibliography, plus at the end of every topic there are references, and/or suggestions for further reading. There are good quality b&w photos throughout. If you are interested in things like near-death experiences, suicide, undertakers, mourning, afterlife beliefs, grief, the death penalty, etc., this book is for you."
4,Paddy Whacked: The Irish Mob,"With all respect to the only other reviewer J Bryce, giving this documentary one star because of segments recreated with actors is like saying a major league baseball game is terrible because of the music and videos on the scoreboard. The History Channel frequently uses actors in its documenteries, mostly because photos or film of the people do not exist. Paddy Whacked: The Irish Mob is excellent, and tells the tale of the early Irish immigrants and their rise to power through politics, law enforcement, and Tammany Hall. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater."
4,Interesting,"After reading almost all of Andrews' books, I thought that Melody was another sad story about someones life. Although very good, it seemed likeall of the other series. I was hoping for a break in the continous drama of family troubles."
3,Very exciting but alot like the others,"Melody is another book by V.C.Andrews that deals with lies and backstabbing within a family. I liked this book but I think that since I have read six of her books already, Virginia Andrews needs to come up with a completely different plot for one of her books that doesn't have to do with people keeping secrets from others and later finding out the truth. I liked this one though because of the strong bonding between characters that seems more superficial in her other books. I liked that this book had more situations people could relate to than her other books. Overall, Melody is a good book and is indeed quite surprising and exciting for first time readers."
4,"An improvement over ""Ruby""!!!","Although it follows the standard ""V.C. Andrews Formula,"" this book did incorporate some new themes and I hope it continues throughout the rest of the series. I really do. I had noticed that Ms. Andrews' books are going down in quality and up in price, but maybe this will mark a change"
3,i just wish you would change,"you know i really love vc.andrews series,but it seems as though this ghostwriter uses the same storyline. i dont want to read about brothers and sisters loving each other any more.i have read each and every vc.anrdrews series. this is my last series to read and it seems like i already know what is going to happen.ghostwriter if you are reading these reviews i dont mean to ofend you,but please lets have a different storyline."
5,A New Twist,"I found Melody to be similar but very unsimilar at the same time to most of VC Andrew's other books. The writers weaved many different story lines into this book, each one just as exciting. Melody was equally good as the rest of the author's works. I can not wait until the next book in the series comes out"
4,This book was great as always coming fom the author.,I enjoyed this book very much. I am very fond of the series that are written. However I find all the books have the same sort of plot. (same scenarios) I would like to see V.C. Andrew books come out with something with a new twist. I can't wait until the next book
1,Not worth any stars (I was forced to put 1 down),"I am a huge fan of V.C. Andrews, but I can no longer read the books being written by the ghostwriter. He just doesn't have the heart that V.C Andrews had when she wrote her stories. It's obvious that this guy is just doing it for the money. V.C. Andrews wrote heroines that were strong and sensible. The ghostwriter's heroines are weak, stupid and naive. It's so irritating to read about lame characters like that! Ghostwriter, please stop writing in her name! The only ones who appreciate your books are junior high kids. Go back and analyze V.C.'s original books. Try to emulate the strong characters that she created!"
3,Am I the only one who thinks...,"This book takes place during the 1960s? I've seen other reviews that describe Melody as a girl of the 1990s. However, on page 130 (in the paperback version), there was reference to The Beatles. On page 205, Adam Jackson tells Melody how all the other girls talk, saying everything is ""groovy"". Nobody talks like that in the 90s. In the book ""Unfinished Symphony"", on page 80, Spike talks about taking Melody to see Grauman's Chinese Theater. It was no longer called that in the 1990s. It had been changed to Mann's Chinese theater by then. If the ghost writer was trying to convey that ""Melody"" took place during the 60s, then he screwed up majorly in writing ""Olivia"". Melody's ""grandmother"" wouldn't have been watching TV as a teenager. Maybe not even if ""Melody"" took place in the 90s. Although I did enjoy reading this book, I didn't give it any more stars because I found the timeline rather confusing. Was it the 60s? The 90s? Who knows?"
4,"Typical of all V.C. Andrews books, but still a great book.",This series gets more and more involved than the last series of books by V.C. Andrews. I get so involved in reading these books I don't know where the time goes. This is yet another great series by V.C. Andrews. I've read every one of V.C. Andrews' books and I'm always looking for the next one to come out. Thanks V.C. for a relief from television!!!
1,An absolute bore,"I was kind of forced to buy the book as it was the only English title I could find in a German bookstore. Andrews doesn't seem to experiment with writing techniques. You've read one, you've read all. Trash it."
2,This was disappointing.,"In the long tradition of her novels I think she would be fairly disappoited with this one. she had a well writtenplot that was butcherd, for lack of a better word, by the ""fill in"" wRiters. I relize that her plots are getting less and less her and more her and more and more them. Why can't good authors be immortal??? I have read the entire collection three or more times. I am 14 and in middle school at Martin in 8th grade. I have been reading these stories since 5th grade and if you have never read a never read a novel by this wonderful person, I recommend NOT starting with this one."
2,WHY???......,"I love V.C. Andrews books. She is a great author, and I want to know why she did this. The book was ok, but it rambled on for 5 whole books, when it could have been two. You know the whole story, and it re-tells you 3 times!! I didn't even read the last one! Well I won't hold it against her because I've read the Wildflowers series, and it was great!"
1,Enough Already!,"V.C. Andrews was a magnificent writer. She wrote breathtaking novels that made her famous. Sadly, she is no longer with us. Why her family continues to write these stories in her name is something I will never understand. Books like Melody are an embarrasment to her legacy. Juxtaposed with Flowers in the Attic, it becomes obvious which novel is brilliant and which is pathetic. I wish the Andrews family would cease to publish such mediocre work under her name."
2,What was this book about?,"I read this book my sophomore year in college because I was bored and I was waiting for classes to start, or something like that. This has got to be the worst series I have read. I don't even remember what the book was about, but from what I gather from the other reviews, it was the same old formula the ghostwriters have used for the past ten years. Get another storyline! Without the incest!"
1,"SOS - SAME OLD STORY, STANDARD OBVIOUS SCRIPT","Another tired installment featuring a talented, long haired protagonist who is a daddy's girl. Another irresponsible, flighty mother, close relationship with a brother figure, twins thrown into the mix and of course a bitter old woman named Olivia. V.C. Andrews stories really seem to feature cruel harpies named Olivia. Questionable paternity, questionable fraternity and bizarre bloodlines all come out in the wash, as one would expect from the standard forumula.Tired, standard fare. This is something you read when you are waiting in the doctor's office and nobody left behind a newspaper. It's a quick read and it is so tired and predictable."
4,Writing not as good as the REAL V.C. ANDREWS,To bad the new writer don't have V.C. Andrews style. She was a great writer. I read all the books that she wrote. The new writer need to go back and review her style of writing. Just stay on this road and don't go off of this style if this is the best you can do
3,I didn't hate it as much as I expected to,"I've read V.C. Andrews before, and expected more of the same old, same old. This was...better. There were places where the characters were more than the stereotypes she usually writes in. The good and evil were more balanced. Solidly not awful."
3,When Melody's life is turned upside down who can help her?,"This book is about a young girl named Melody whose life is turned inside out, when her father is killed in the coal mines. She is devastated about her father's death. Soon after his death her mother gets with the guy who works at a saloon in their town. Her mother tells her that they are moving with the guy whose name is Richard. She is very upset that she has to leave her friends, and her wanna-be grandparents. Melody thinks that she is going to be traveling with her mom, and her new stepfather, but instead her mom takes her to stay with her father's brother. She has never met them before, yet she is suppose to live with them. While staying with them she discovers all kind of stories about her mother and father she had never know before. She is so hurt, but before she can talk to her mom, her mom dies. The only person left to talk to be a man who is suppose to be her real father."
3,A mediocre first step to a great story,"I'm an avid reader of Stephen Donaldson and have read everything of his I can get my hands on. The Real Story was a big disappointment after the Covenenant Chronicles and his other works. It is worth reading, however, as the series becomes much better from the second book on. I hold the last four books in the series as very readable."
2,Welcome to the darkest corners of Stephen Donalsons mind,"I have been a long standing fan of Stephen R Donalson, and automatically pick up anything he writes. Unfortunately, the best thing about this book is the fact that it is short. The Real Story strikes me as an emotional hairball that the author just had to cough up... The characters are either vile or uninteresting and the story seems to exist as a vehicle for sexual deviance and violence. Although the series itself does develop into something moderately interesting, this is a poor starting point that seems to point to some dark fantasy of the authors more than an actual story."
2,A Lackluster 007 Score,"When ""The Living Daylights"" emerged as composer John Barry's 007 swan song, the long-running film series took a nosedive in the scoring department. Incredibly enough, Michael Kamen's music for ""Licence to Kill"" (1989) proved less memorable than the erratic Michel Legrand score in ""Never Say Never Again."" Even the traditional James Bond Theme lacked punch. Gladys Knight's excellent title song and Patti LaBelle's superior ballad ""If You Asked Me To"" outstripped Kamen's bland orchestrations. The Barry touch was sorely missed."
2,ONLY THE VOCAL TRACKS ARE THE BEST.,"I was very disappointed with this CD. All the tracks are just plain boring. It doesn't even sound like a James Bond soundtrack except for brief bursts of the James Bond theme here and there. What happened to the track where James Bond and Felix trap Sanchez's airplane and then parachute from it? The only good songs are the vocals like: Track 1, the title song for LICENCE TO KILL sung by Gladys Knight, and track 5, If You Asked Me To sung by Patti LaBelle. If you really, absolutely love James Bond then get it, but if you don't really like James Bond, definitely think twice before buying this CD. But this is only my opinion."
2,Only Two Reasons to Recommend This One:,"(1) The title cut, soulfully done by Gladys Knight and (2) Patti Labelle's original rendering of a song later to be made famous by Celine Dion, ""If You Asked Me To.""Everything else is lackluster, befitting this pale entry in the Bond series."

5,Great book,Dr. Raphael must have an angel on his shoulder. His insights as to the motives of the Father are very logical and follow the idea that God is Love. And that God's actions and motives flow from that first fact. Thank you for your work.
5,"Versatile zoom range, good image quality","I really like this lens. While the image quality is not as good as a prime it is good for a zoom. I know some people have reported problems with Pentax I have not had any problems with my DL. The lens is heavy compared to some of the newer zooms, but I don't find that to be a problem. The zoom range works well for many situations where a prime might be limiting."
1,never received product,"product ordered on 11-10-06. It is now January 19, 2007. UPS claims they delivered it and left it on the front porch. I was home that day. They never delivered it and still having difficulty getting the product or my money back."
4,This book was great!,"I would recommend it for anyone who likes baseball. I would also like to comment on the ""misprint"". There was a team called the Boston Braves. They moved first to Milwaukee and then to Atlanta."
4,What a surprise!,"I'm not sure what motivated me to order this---except that I find the work of each director interesting, and the price is sure right. When I order a public domain cheapie I'm prepared for poor prints, noisy audio, etc. But I was absolutely knocked out by the print quality and transfers on BOTH of these movies. The Superscope ""Burma"" is even enhanced for widescreen. The color was mostly good on both movies, and I didn't notice any significant film damage or dirt. The movies are OK, interesting primarily because of the casts. Both leading ladies were a bit long in the tooth for their roles, but they still show their star quality.VCI gets a gold star for a release that looks like WHV did it from the original elements. The artwork is enough to scare anyone away, however.And I really wish that they wouldn't have one of their people write Amazon reviews for their product.If you want a couple of pretty good Saturday afternoon flicks very well presented, you just can't go wrong."
1,great.dissappointment,"I am always a little wary of dvds that seem to be a bargain.In the case of this appalling double bill my suspicions were justified.I was hoping for a couple of reasonably entertaining B movies.Appointment in Hondurasis barely watchable,i spent so much time adjusting the picture i lost track of the story,such as it was.Escape to Burma was so washed out and blurry i threw it in the bin after five minutes.Amazingly this dvd recieved five star reviews!!Who is writing them?Do not waste your money on this rubbishy presentation"
1,DVD Player Quit,"As with other's reviews, the DVD player quit working after 12 months (just out of warranty). MAGNAVOX has declined servicing or exchanging after warranty expiration eventhough I was expecting to pay for repair/exchange. They have basically abandoned a poor product. Looks like I'll be the one abandoning them in the future."
2,Everyone seems to be having DVD problems!!!,"Everyone else seems to love this TV, but I've had my problems. I've had the TV about 3 months and the DVD player decided to stop working. It makes a whirring and clicking sound, but won't load the DVD. I called Magnavox just in time becuase my warranty was about to expire in 3 days. They are making me ship them the TV at my expense, and then they will send me a new one. Even when this TV was working I felt the picture was too dark, and I had to turn the brightness up really high to get a good picture. Also, the speakers are good quality, but just not loud enough. My friend has a Kodak LCD TV and it seems to be much better quality than the Magnavox. I think this unit is just overpriced...not a good value!"
2,Don't buy this for the DVD player.,"I was interested in this unit because it fit wonderfully in my small urban apartment, but was extremely dismayed when the DVD unit stopped working after three months. Do not buy this TV if you plan on using the DVD. The picture quality, however, is surprisingly good."
1,DVD Broken TWICE!,DVD Broken TWICE in 3 months. I returned it when the first one broke within 32 days of purchase. #2 DVD stopped working after about 45 Days...... Was a great picture!
2,DVD quit after 3 months,"I have the 26"" model and I've watched two DVD in the 4 months that I've owned the TV. The DVD player is not working. I bought a refurb and it started acting up right after the warranty ended. The television has a great picture and works fine and has alot of features. Save the money and buy a model without the DVD player. I wish I read these reviews prior to buying it."
2,DVD Player broke 4 months after purchase!,"The DVD player gave out after 4 months, and will be expensive to fix. I am also disappointed with the remote control, which drains batteries quickly. I've bought batteries for the remote 3 times since I bought it 4 months ago."
1,"Do not buy, DVD player will fail - Customer service was poor","This is the same TV as you may see by Philips, Magnavox, & Initial, just with different logos on the front. I've had two of these TV's, and the DVD player has failed on both of them. I talked to the Initial customer service manager multiple times, and he insisted that they have a ""less than 1%"" return rate... LIES. Look at the number of people saying the dvd player has quit in just days to months of use. If it was a 1:100 defect rate, then the odds of me having two separate units that both fail would be 1:10,000!!!! Give me a break and don't lie to your customers! Paying shipping back to the company was expensive, and then... the last replacement's DVD player again failed after 13 months. Unbelieveable. I'm just waiting for somebody to start a class action suit for a terrible product, so I can send this junk back."
4,Civil Litigation in Connecticut,"This is an excellent resource for the litigation paralegal, full of useful information. I wish I could locate an updated copy with the most recent local rules!"
1,not good,"...the first thing I see is that the front cover picture is all blurry. Plus the photos inside are all black and white. ""worst book ever"" as the comic book guy would say."
4,So delicious you have to watch yourself,"These meal replacement/protein bars are delicious. They taste like a candy bar and they are HUGE. Longer and thicker than the standard protein bars you see in the grocery store. They have a ton of protein and they are really filling. But, be warned, they are so delicious it's hard to limit yourself -- at least for me, but I have a sweet tooth. Make sure you have the discipline to limit yourself to just one or two. Great product."
2,Dimensions different,"This is a nice container. However, the external dimensions are 15 1/4"" x 15 1/4"" x 3 1/2"". The internal dimensions are 13 1/4"" x 13 1/4"" x 2 3/4"". I purchased it thinking that it would be larger than typical scrapbook containers, but it would not work for my purposes. Please be advised when purchasing."
5,A Real Treasure,"Yes, I know; recordings of Bach's orchestral suites are legion, but this mono performance by Felix Prohaska and the Vienna State Opera Chamber Orchestra is the one to which I return again and again. The tempi are slower than the modern ""historic performances"" with ""period instruments,"" but this recording exudes a sweetness that many more modern renditions lack. Historically, Prohaska was one of the musicians who began a new era of baroque (and Bach) performance, and it certainly shows in this 1952 recording. Here is a real Bach treasure that certainly deserves to be reissued."
1,Flat As A Pancake,This album has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It must have been some sort of contractual obligation thing. This must be what JB sounds like after a weekend without either rum or tequila. Return to sender...postage due.
2,Flimsy Backboard,"I was disappointed in the flimsiness of the backboard and net. The advertisement led me to believe the backboard was much stronger. Also, a couple of washers were missing in the package."
3,DVD,The item in question had to be cleaned several times not happy about it but it seems to be working now.
1,Disappointing,"Read David McCullogh's John Adams instead - much more informative than the film and comes alive, as all his histories do, with insight, historical accuracy, and the accurate detail essential to understanding the historical context and its layered realities. Few films or miniseries achieve a satisfying window into the reality of the time they portray - think of Schindler's List, Lawrence of Arabia, Lincoln as rare examples of those that do – this one does not satisfy. There was a great deal more going on with Adams and Jefferson, Adams and Franklin, Washington, Hamilton, etc. The series does communicate the extraordinary relationship between John and Abigail - but in my judgment does not recognize fully the very special intelligence of Abby and her unique understanding of American history even as it was unfolding."
3,"Good, not great","It was pretty good. Nowhere near as good as the HBO miniseries. But, there was some good information in there."
1,Blank Movie Sent!!!!,"I ordered The American Experience: John and Abigail Adams. It was a surprise for my husband who loves Johns Adams and his history. I gave it to my husband two weeks after getting it in the mail. He opened it and tried to play it on all three of our DVD players...and two of our friends. The DVD comes up blank. We do not have the info to send it back anymore, as I threw it away before giving wrapping it for my husbands present. :("
5,Wonderful,"I caught this documentary on PBS tonight and immediately went online to see if it was available on DVD. The story of John and Abigail Adams is one of the most poignant in American history, and this film makes it accessible to even the most uninterested history-phobe. Interviews and cheesy re-enactments are cut to a minimum, and most of the story is told in voice-over and with quotes from letters written by John, Abigail, and their contemporaries, making it easy to watch as well as riveting. I was pleased with the portryal of John Adams here as well as Abigail; the insight into the founding of the US through their correspondence was eye-opening."
3,Intro book - lite on actual custom controls content,"In my opinion, this is an intro book to GDI+ with only a very few chapters on Custom controls of any substance. The book seems well written and I like the fact that it was not written by committee as many/most of Wrox books are. I bought the book based on the title with expectations of more advanced topics being covered, but I should have spent time looking at the detailed table of contents. A more appropriate title for this would have been `An Introduction to GDI+'. My recommendation would be to look at the detailed table of contents and if it meets your needs then buy it otherwise hold off and use the documentation available online."
5,Excellent Introduction!,"This is the kind of book you want to read when you want to get started with GDI+ development, and custom controls in particular. Yes, there are a lot of things that are not explained, but they, GDI+ and custom control development is a huge topic and couldn't possibly be covered in one book! The information provided in this book is excellent. It covers the basics of GDI+, custom control development, printing, and even web related stuff you may not think of at first. What's missing is how to build input-oriented controls, such as as fancy grids or spreadsheets and other advanced topics. But then again, I wouldn't expect a book like this to cover these topics."
5,GREAT DEAL!,"I bought this stroller off amazon a few weeks ago when it was on sale for $80. I was so lucky to have found it! I have a keyfit 30 carseat and I hadn't bought the stroller yet and was dreading spending the money. When I saw the sale I was a little skeptical because I had never seen this model before. I tried searching online for reviews other than on amazon and didn't find many. I'm so glad I purchased it! The quality of Chicco is amazing! I love the 360 handles and the carseat fits perfectly. As another reviewer said the drink carrier isn't very large, well remember it's a European stroller, it's going to be small. There is even an umbrella holder; so European. The storage bag underneath is a little hard to access, but not that big of a deal for me. The canopy on top is great. I live in an area where it snows and taking a walk is no problem because the canopy covers so far. The stroller handles well and the again the quality is great. I would definitely buy it again."
4,LONG LIVE HARD ROCK,"excellent band, stop saying that they need a little help with the songwriting, hard rock and glam metal its only having fun, is not that serious as other types of metal, the voice is awesome, the drums, the guitars and the bass also, i like a lot this band and i thnik they should be more bands like this in our days because glam and hard rock is almost dead except for the big bands, LONG LIVE FOREVER HARD ROCK"
4,love this phone,"We bought an old house with only one (can you believe it) phone jack. The remote handsets don't need phone jacks, just the cradles to recharge them. I love this phone. The only problem I've had is that the number buttons on the main unit started to wear out so I just switched it with another unit. I have neighbors in all directions and our baby monitors interfere with each other all the time but have never had a problem with our phones. I checked since I don't want every hearing my phone conversations. It was also the best priced unit of it's kind on the market at the time."
5,Phones work GREAT!!!!!!!!!,We had shipping mishap on these phones; but other that they worked FANTASTIC!
1,Button quit working,"The buttons quit working after a short while. I took the phones apart, and cleaned the contacts. That worked for a short while, but they quit again."
2,A mixed bag,"I don't hate these pants but my feelings about them are very mixed. They are comfortable and the fabric is stretchy enough for even the most rigorous yoga practice. However, the slits in the back mean the fabric swims around your legs. This is problematic in poses such as pigeon, when these pants really get in the way. Also, they're pretty expensive. I have friends who are yoga or pilates instructors who love and live in these pants, but I just can't get that excited about them. (That being said, I do keep them and continue to wear them occasionally to yoga class or meditation group, so they're not a total loss.)UPDATE: I've come to like these pants a lot more. I still use them - three years later - and they hold up very well. They show very little wear. I've adjusted to the extra fabric. I've also bought a couple other pairs of the Be Present pants that are shorter - knee length - and I absolutely love those. I now recommend Be Present pants to friends without reservations."
1,You gotta be berserker to read this book!,"We have a copy of Berserker Wars in our college lending library at Yale. Some fool left it there. I know he was a fool because Berserker Wars is the worst book I've ever seen, and anyone who really read it is a nut. I'm not sure if the story's really true like the cover says. If it is true, we're all in for a lot of trouble. The illustrations, however, are good for a taking the mickey."
1,why me,used gm part # to Identify...When no one responds receive wrong part...hard to return tried twice still no good paid local price done in 2 days
2,bad toy,this toy stinks. you just put it on a stand and watch it for the rest of your life. i would just get the b-17 its much cheaper and u get to build it. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,All the team building books distilled to purity,"The title is the whole point of the book. The 200+ pages that follow elaborate on the simple point of exchanging results for excuses. The message is a simple one that might well have fit into a volume only half as thick. At times the authors are tediously repetitious and sometimes the overuse of metaphors seems a bit contrived or trite. However, the book reads very quickly and stays directly on the point at all times. The authors make a convincing case that eliminating excuses in the workplace is a ""magic bullet"" for controlling virtually every other common problem we face daily. They open with what the problems are, why they're all related to excuses and step by step what we can do to get rid of excuses and start getting results instead. The authors don't pull any punches or wander around in the world of ""but if"". They tell it ""Pollianna"" straight. If you want results, instead of excuses, read this book."
2,This book is NOT what you think it is...,"Most USB devices are connected like PC to USBBus to USBDevice to RealWorld. I bought this book thinking it would explain the PC to USBDevice part, but much of this book is about the USBDevice RealWorld part. About the last 50% of the book is a discussion of all the nifty things people are, or will be, connecting via USB (I mean DSL? Cable Modems? Cameras? Sound? BAR CODE READERS??? In a book about designing USB devices?) Unfortunately, I already know how to interface a microcontroller to the real world, so this book wasn't terribly useful to me. In the author's defense, in the 1st half of the book he does present a well written, if not very detailed, introduction to writing USB code, USB Signaling, etc. Had he expanded this section to be the entire book, I think I would have been quite satisfied with the money I spent on it."
5,Excellent if your new to USB,"I read 3 other books about USB and none of them explained USB better than this book does. This book details a lot of points that others seem to take for granted. If your into hardware and don't want to go into driver design and want to get something going quick this is the book to read. The CD-rom is excellent too, it has a lot of tools and examples that you will need to get started, even sample programs to get you going and templates for your future products. The only downside of the book I feel was the last few chapters, it gets off-topic, more into the consumer products arena and just not technical enough.However this book is worth every penny and I recommend it to all you hardware engineers out there. Good work John (Author)"
2,it doesn't tell you all you need to know,"You couldn't follow the examples in the book to get the projects working. If you have experience with USB already, this maybe good to expand your knowledge."
3,wouldn't be a reissue if they didn't get at least one thing wrong...,"It is so great to have several labels that are dedicated to reissuing classic albums by 80s artists with plenty of bonus tracks, but inevitably, almost every release falls short of giving fans everything they want (and everything that deserves to be brought into the digital age). The good news here is that BOTH remixes from the ""Room at the Top"" 12"" are present. The bad news--instead of giving us BOTH remixes of Rough Stuff that were done back in the day, they give us an EDIT of the remix already on here! The ""alternate mix"" of this track is actually the one I prefer (it was the b-side to the original promo 12""). Guess it was just too obscure for the label to even realize it existed? And of course, those who never knew the promo only mix existed wouldn't even know what they were missing."
3,Not bad,"I have just about everything this man has ever made. I will love him forever. That said, this album is just ok. My favorite song on it is Can't Set Rules About Love which I think is one of the best pop songs ever. That should have been the first single instead of Room At The Top (which became a big hit when it was released- so I guess he knew what he was doing!). There are songs I love (see above), songs I like and songs that I skip over. If this is your first Adam Ant purchase....dont get it. Get Kings of the Wild Frontier or if you like the pop stuff get Friend Or Foe. ... But if you just can't get enough of him, then go ahead and buy it. I think everyone should have Cant Set Rules About Love."
4,Great instructions & techniques,"Lots of techniques to apply to various parts of your life.However, you should have get some practice with creative visualization before. I borrowed the 2 tape/cd version from my local library first and was so intrigued I bought the 6 tape version. I have practiced Silva method quite a bit before so some of the techniques here are familiar to me. Lots of parallels between methodologies. Many paths in the same direction. This series has most of the techniques that are sold individually for much more on eBay etc. Similarly, between this series and NLP : The New Technology of Achievement, you seem to get most of topics covered by the $ x,000 NLP practitioner courses."
1,Very disappointing,I love to read and listen to NLP tapes and C.D's to learn all the techniques I possibly can. I must say that in all honesty I was very disappointed in the content of these two c.d.s. Anthony Robbins NLP c.d.'s are the best I've listened to so far. These c.d.'s lacked the content that I was hoping for.
2,Speak/Eeek!,"This album suffers from slick, busy, faux folk-rock, and mostly weak songs. It's their second-to-worst album (the absolute abyss of their career being the enervated ""can we go home now""). There IS one great song as has been mentioned in another review -- Maggie's ""nocturne."" Several other songs have lovely melodies, but these sag under the depressing weight of the fake sonics. If you're looking for good mid to late Roches, avoid this one and search out ""another world"" and ""a dove"" -- both wonderful and light years better -- but both sadly out of print (if only that fate had befallen ""speak"" and ""can we go home now"" instead.)Here is my own personal Top Five best Roches albums:1. The Roches2. Keep on Doing3. A Dove4. Seductive Reasoning (Maggie & Terre Roche)5. Another World"
2,Music to hide from the world by,"As a twenty-something, I loved the Roches. Their skewed harmonies, bratty junior-high choir vocalizing, and ironic distance echoed my own alienation and insecurity. Recently, though, I listened to this album for the first time in a long time, and was amazed at how little there is here to sustain interest.To be sure, there's nothing like the sound of a family harmonizing together, and on rare occasions, the girls let their guard down enough to let that natural beauty shine through. But, overall, the Roches sound afraid to grow up, feel their feelings, and own their womanhood. It's no accident that their determined asexuality has led them into the realm of children's music on subsequent albums.If you're looking for wonder and joy, maturely expressed, check out Brian Wilson's ""Smile"". Too bad that album was so long in coming -- the Roches could have taken lessons."
2,flat notes aplenty,"Perhaps 5 good songs on the cd. including: Big Nuthin, Cloud Dancing & Everyone is Good.As with all Roches albums their tone-deaf harmonizing elicits moments of real revulsion. There is enough accidental dissonance on this CD to fill any other artists entire career. It's astonishing that their story has lasted this long. These girls just cannot get over their dorky high school years in the 70s.One wonders what they could do if they ever completed their singing lessons and aimed for a more urbane funny bone."
3,lousy production,"This would have to be the nadir of the Roches recorded works. Although there are some great songs to be found here, the production of most varies from woeful to shocking. And for some reason the sisters have written some of the most cloying and twee lyrics ever: ""I Love My Mum"", anyone? A very selective listen, with the acapella track ""Cloud Dancing"" and the solo piano accompaniment on ""Losing Our Job"" being the most effective. A great shame, as other tracks such as ""Nocturne"" (the only decent production job) and ""Feeling Is Mutual"" boast beautiful melodies."
1,want to go bald?...,"scratching your head so much trying to figure this book out then ENJOY! In 24 hours you too can have all the confusion of XML as you when you strarted the book + be a bald! (at no extra charge to you)I will have to say if you are interested in reading a book about writing xml code about writing xml code. Then this is perfect for you.Confused? yeh me too... you'd think if someone spent the time to write a book about writing XML code they might would throw you a few more examples of how the actual code is written rather than spending the whole book talking about the history of XML.I sort of feel like I could tell you anything about XML; how it started, the cool people who could use XML, I could even tell you what XML wore to SGML's birthday party last year. I couldn't tell you how to write the code sadly enough."
3,Good book spoiled for a ha'porth of tar,"For the first couple of chapters I thought it was great. However, as it became more complex, the explanations were in dire need of accompanying examples.Worse still, the index is so inaccurate that the book is almost worthless as a reference. For example, 'Comments' are supposed to be on page 94, which is a Workshop page. And you will look in vain for PCDATA on pages 54-55.With a bit more thoroughness, this could have been a really good introduction to XML."
2,Disappointed in SAMS,"I agree with the gentleman above (Mr. Sholto L. Douglas). I am 1/4 of the way into the book and I was so disappointed I just had to read the review on this book, which I should have done prior to purchasing it. However my previous experience with SAMS books had been excellent so I purchased it at a bookstore based on the publisher. I won't make that mistake again. From now on I'll purchase from Amazon AFTER reading the reviews.As Mr. Douglas states the examples are sparse and poor. I am used to SAMS books providing many concise examples, analogies and exercises that aid in your learning. Not everyone learns best by theory.Since I have never experienced Mr. Morrison's work my disappointment lies with SAMS. They usually put out a better product. I will return this book tomorrow. There have got to be a number of books that handle this subject better."
5,A superbly organised and well-written book,"This book is a brilliant ""searchlight""through the seemingly endless streamof acronyms and maze of new/emergingtechnologies in the XML world.Sensibly, it doesn't go toodeep into any one of the XML technologiesbut strikes an **excellent** balance bygiving you enough detail to acquaint yourselfwith ""what's out there, why it's useful andhow it all fits together"". It also givesnumerous well-thought-out examples.A clear guide to ""the big picture"" withoutbeing superficial -- and that's very hardto do.Highly recommended -- nice one Mr Morrison!!"
4,Well-done path through the jungle of concepts,"The author managed to nail down the complexity of the XML world by visiting topics multiple times: first for a brief explanation to set the context, then again in-depth to a reasonably detailed level.This makes some paragraphs look like like ""deja-vu""; indeed there is quite some repetition of the material along the run. The reader must be careful not to loose stuff that seems to be known from a previous chapter."
5,Read the book before reviewing!,"I doubt that the person who gave such a negative review even read this book, which is well researched, well written and full of usefull information."
5,A COMEDY/DRAMA MASTERPIECE!!!!!,"Yet another masterpiece from John Hughes. I have always had a lot of respect for John Hughes and there are a number of films that I enjoyed. This film I have seen many times and I like it more every time I see it. It is pretty twisted and hard to predict, however it has a powerful story behind it. A story about mistakes and getting a second chance at making a new beginning!! If you haven't seen it, please do!! Allessandro Nivola is a great actor and he was wonderful in this film!!!I highly recommend it!!!"
1,"Great Soundtrack, Poor Movie",Not enough content to stretch out a two hour long movie. This one-scenario-driven plot would be better off as a short television episode. This was the most ametuer movie I have ever seen outside of made for television movies. I kept waiting for it to get better and I endured it to the very end to my complete disapointment.
3,"Love John Hughes, hate this director.","The script could have given John Hughes a big fat welcome back to the world of good cinema, but this director is just ridiculously television. Two words for ya big guy! NATURAL LIGHT! The script was great! It could have been wonderful, but no. They had to give it to some kid who got tired of directing 90210 episodes. John! Come back to us!"
3,"Excellent acting, disappointing editing and cinematography","This is a film that could have been great. The fact that it is merely fair is by no means a reflection on the cast or on the script -- both are top-notch. It's intelligent, literate, and each performance shines. Unfortunately, it falls apart in what I can only assume is the most uninspired film editing and cinematography I've ever seen. Which is a crying shame, because this film could have been absolutely remarkable. As it is, it's still worth watching for the actors and script."
2,The music was above and beyond the call of duty.,The characters were unlikeable and the set looked low budget. The thing that stands out like a sore thumb was McEntire's soundtrack. It's too bad John McEntire and his click got stuck making music for such a dull nineties flick.
4,The Book Of Knowledge will not make you rich.,"I inherited a mildewed copy of the book which I intend to read more fully soon (outdoors -- just thumbing through it killed my sinuses). The recipes are very good, the ""Book of Knowledge"" part is more etiquette and homespun advice. Definitely a good book for the shelf as a historical view of how to act in society and cook for dinner parties if you still live in 1890."
2,Good to fall asleep,"There are 11 short movies presented on this dvd. Unfortunately, only 2 of them are quite good (so, I give 2 stars).The first one is ""Foto star"", the second one ""Offerte speciale"".The rest is boring, uninspiring, poor filmed or acted. Watching some of them I had a feeling that the only reason to shoot them was to show some naked men or sex.Save your time and money."
5,this is great for any leopard gecko owner!,this is a great book for anyone who owns leopard geckos! it packs a lot of information into one little book and covers what you would need to know to take care of your gecko. if you have or are getting a leopard gecko this book is a great reference guide and can help to keep your gecko healthy and happy! a must have for the leopard gecko owner!
3,Handeling,"The information is great minus one the, the handleing section. When i got my leopard gecko, i never read any books. I went to the pet store and talked to them. Everytime i was there i held my Emeril (thats my geckos name). OK, so yes they have sensitive tails and sharp nails, but they dont get caught in fabric that easily. I have had mine for 3 years and have held him and let him walk all over me and my bed and teh counter. and he is fine. still with his tail, and all his fingers. So please, hold your gecko and ignore tht section!"
4,Baby Bash (Beesh) screwded and chopped,"If you do not like your music screwed you will probably not like this but if you do this is a good album to get it is kind of like DJ Screw but close, its a good album but could of been done more screwed style"
3,decent,as a former memeber of dopehouse baby bash put down the chicano style of rap that represebted the hispanics in a real way.I have seen beesh in concert at the tequila boom in corpus christi texas and he has put on a good show. for this being screwed it reps the late dj . screw the originator of screw but nobody can do it like him. overall the screwing wasnt great but tha album was
5,Crown of Life,"This book presents a concise catalog of the various yogic methods and religions, how they work and the results one can achieve with each form. It then focuses on Surat Shabd Yoga - the highest path - that leads to self-realization and then God-realization."
5,"hot stone, therapy, video","This video is a must when purchasing the hot stones and warmer from Amazon. It definitely helps the amateur when wondering how to properly use the stones. It was very detailed, did not rush through any important motions or methods and made the amateur Masseuse feel a bit better about creating the right atmosphere, using the correct techniques, and how to use the stones. Care instructions were given in detail on how to care for the stones you purchase, and how each size stone can be used in the massage process.I thoroughly enjoyed the video, as it gave me the knowledge I needed to use the stones as they were intended, and to practice the perfect massage."
3,Bonacure products,"I really think Bonacure products are great - I use other of their hair care products. I think I made a mistake when I ordered this. I thought my hair had electricity because it was dry and needed moisture. However, in using this product, it did nothing to help - so I was incorrect. So if you are ordering it for that (to rid hair of electricity), it will not help."
4,Good product,Made my hair nice and soft. I was hoping it would make my hair seem healthier but I'm not sure about that. Fast shipping as well.
5,Best conditioner ever,"Leaves hair soft and managable with no film..hair is shiny and strong after repeated use. Excellent for processed hair. Dont worry about the cost, this product lasts a long time when used properly."
5,Excellent,"The truly cool thing about this particular Chernev book is thatthere are diagrams every few moves, so you can read it withouta board. I got it in a used book store, and almost jumped for joy.A good mix of tactics and strategy, but leaning moretoward tactics compared with ""Sixty Most Instructive"", for example.Strangely enough, Bruce Pandolfini, many years later, came out with a book with a similar title (""Russian Chess"") and format(diagrams every few moves). Of course, different games, andalso recommended.Yet Chernev himself could also ""borrow"". For example, the notes from one of the Tarraschmasterpieces from ""Sixty Most Instructive"", were obviously liftedfrom Reinfelds' great Tarrasch book.But so what? Chernev is the greatest for my playing strength ( around 1700)."
1,A $50 Paperweight,"This product doesn't work. I have a R.E.D. Tantrum Audio Helmet that supports A2DP. The concept is that you can wear a helmet while skiing or snowboarding and be able to listen to music and make and receive phone calls through the included Motorola bluetooth headphones. This system only works to its full potential if everything, including the music, streams through bluetooth. So, I searched for an iPod bluetooth adaptor and after some research stumbled on the Jabra A125s. Long story short, it's unusable. The sound cuts in and out (usually out) constantly such that it's not even worth pairing to the headphones. I know the culprit is the Jabra because tests other bluetooth solutions work perfectly.After giving up in frustration, I attempted to contact Jabra and see if this is a common problem with this device, or if I had a faulty unit. I've sent three emails and one letter but have heard NOTHING back from Jabra.Stear clear of this product."
3,A few flaws on a potentially great product,"I have the BT620S headphones along with the A125S adapter and they work great together! I have no problem syncing the 2 and listening to my iPod music, but the A125s has a couple of nasty issues. First, the device falls out of the iPod very easily. There are no clasping hooks like some other docking devices have, so I have had to rig my own method using Velcro to keep it attached to the iPod. Second, I primarily use this in my office at work, but cannot do so if the battery runs out. I initially figured I could plug it in and still listen while it charged, but I could not. I even had a little hope that charging the device while connected to my iPod would possibly charge the iPod as well, but no. Outside of these 2 frustrations, it works wonderfully syncing and playing my music."
5,Making Ipod bluetooth compatiable,"I wear the new Oticon EPOQ hearing aids with a streamer. before I purchased the Jabra, I had to physically connect a cable between the Oticon Streamer and the Ipod. Now the interface between my Ipod and hearing aids is completely wireless. For those that haven't investigated Oticon EPOQ hearing aids, I would urge you to. Instead of being hearing impaired, those of us that wear hearing aids become hearing empowered!"
2,Only useful when the speaker is 1 ft from the transmitter,"This unit worked fine in my car, when my iPod was about a foot from the receiver. But the reason I bought it was so that I could put my iPod in my bike's seat bag and have it work with my bluetooth headphones. No go. If I was holding the iPod in my hand while riding, the audio worked fine. As soon as I put it in my seat bag (which is still less than 4 ft. from the headphones) the audio would drop out constantly. Do not waste your money."
1,Don't waste your money.,The adaptor does not hook to the Ipod. Sitting in one spot is okay but please dont move. The Motorola D650 works one hundred percent better.
2,Works but Flimsy,"It works just fine, if you are sitting your Ipod in 1 place and not moving it at all.The adaptor does not hook in it just sits attached to the Ipod."
2,Jabra BT620s Bluetooth Adaptor - not as good as it seems,"When I came across this product, which was by accident, I grew excited...thinking, FINALLY. As I read the product information - I thought it was a great idea. So I decided to buy it coupled with the Jabra BT620s Bluetooth Headphone for my brand new ipod. I gave a true run of it, testing it out for a couple of months. My final thought is that I don't think the technology is up with the great idea. I found it very frustrating that my signal was constantly being interrupted, the volume only seems to go to a level '5' on a scale from 0 to 10. AND the adapter doesn't stay in the ipod. I don't think I would recommend this product."
1,10 meters my @..,It's no better than the icombi. I cannot put it in my cargo pants pocket and have continuous connection.
2,don't buy,"I just bought the Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor for Ipod. It doesn't have the 2 little pins on the side like the others have to hold it secure so it fits loose in the Ipod and I keep loosing my connection. Running, walking, riding my bike, doesn't matter what, the slightest movement makes it loose the connection. Definitely not a good buy. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"
1,DOA - Does not charge - Returned,I should have listened to the last review. It doesn't charge. Wasted some $ and effort to ship it back for return
1,jabra,I received the item and it would not take a charge. I decided to get another and it will charge but the battery quickly drains after only a few minutes. Looks like I wasted my money and time. Oh well. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!!!
2,Bad Design Limits Usefulness,"I bought this to use with an Iphone. Yes, it DOES work with Iphone but not perfectly. It really wants to play Ipod audio, and trying to play other formats with this device can be difficult because it thinks all commands are being sent to the Ipod function. But it works! It does stream audio to your bluetooth headset and does integrate with a separate bluetooth link with your phone. The problem is that the connector does not lock into place, and this is a serious flaw in my opinion. It is held in by the friction of the contacts only, and will fall out easily. It is not compatible with many kinds of cases for the iphone, and I would imagine the same problem occurs with Ipod cases. Other than the price, I cannot recommend this product."
4,Works very well for me !!,"I love it! I bought this bundled with the BT620S headeset and could not be more pleased at the present time. Sure, in the future technological innovations will surpass the ease of use, quality, etc. but this (to me) is the best avail today for wireless connectivity with high quality stereo. The bundle provides either AC or USB charging of devices. Pairing bluetooth a little tedious yet patience often needed with bt devices. Firm ipod connection. Compare pricing beforehand as it varies and discounts can be had."
1,"Worthless, do not buy!","This adaptor sounds terrible, needs it's own power, but no AC charger is included (USB charge cable only), and worst of all, won't stay connected to the iPod accessory connector, unless COMPLETELY still. So no carrying in your bag or jacket, and forget using it with any kind of case.Completely useless!"
2,Not what I expected,"This book wasn't what I expected, but it was interesting. It's more organized into groupings of quotes or excerpts from welcoming rituals.It had some lovely things that we used for my daughter's welcoming, though I wish it would have given citations for where these excerpts came from. I found a few that I was fascinated by and wanted to read the rest of it, but could not find where it came from.If you are looking for ideas or quotes to get you started creating your own welcoming, this book will help a little. If you are curious about the history behind the quotes used...this book won't help at all."
4,Excellent Dog Treats,My three dogs love the Solid Gold Beef Jerky treats. The treats are very high quality and I definitely plan to reorder.
5,vintage mustang service manual,"we needed the manual for a 1965 mustang we were helping a friend with. We found it on Amazon, at a good price. It arrived sooner than we expected, was as described, and was very helpful in getting our job done. And we're sure it will be helpful many times in the future."
3,What's A Pimp?,"Too $hort is a Legend...but that doesn't mean that everything he does is automatically good. What's My Favorite Word was a classic Short album released just 2 years ago (2002). It had the funky playalistic riding songs, vintage Too Short rhyming, excellent beats and top notch guests including Twista, Lil John, Gipp, Devin, E-40 and Bun B among others. It was undeniable. His new album Married To The Game doesn't fare quite as well. The album is very uneven. For example, The first seven songs are great and makes you think it's finna be another Short Dog classic. But from there the album takes a horrible dive...delving even into the 'unlistenable' status and that is just uncharicteristic of Too Short. The last 8 songs are some of the worst songs Too $hort has ever done; however the first 7 make the album 'worth having' and to Short fans this should already be in your collection regardless if it is subpar or not. But to others...you might want to take a listen to it first. 3 stars."

4,Understand what you're buying; low price means low quality,"It is functional and looks fine BUT understand that this a cheaply made product. If you want a decorative item or something that will last a long time, look elsewhere.Pros:-large seed capacity-very easy to fill-only minor assembly (snapping the bird stands onto the sides, very easy, took 30 seconds)Cons-cheap plastic/assembly-does not instill confidence that it will last, I don't think it would survive even a fairly minor fall onto a hard surface.-not aesthetically perfect: it seems to scratch really easily and gets that cloudy cheap plastic scratched look.Summary:Perfectly functional. If i was buying again I would spend a few more dollars and buy something that feels more solid, but I don't feel cheated or misled in any sense by this product. It will certainly work until it breaks."
2,Not happy,"I just purchased this feeder, put it all together according to instructions but found the perches didn't want to lock in.They constantly fall out and already it looks like one is missing.I'm disappointed with it."
2,Poorly constructed,"I ordered this bird feeder as a supplement to my other cylinder feeder that seemed to be overpopulated. The feeder looked good straight out of the box. However, that's the last time it looked nice. The lid was screwed on too tight and when I finally managed to get it loose, I found that the side seams were not attached to one another towards the top allowing the hanging handle to come out. I have a feeling that the over-tightening of the lid made the sides not seal properly. Also, before I even hung up the feeder, one of the perches broke off :(So now, I have a feeder that is missing a perch, and if I pull on the feeder at all while the lid is off, the handle comes right out. Overall, it's doing what I want, feeding the birds, but I wish it was more sturdy."
1,Falls apart quickly,you get what you pay for. I have been through two of these in the past year and they fall apart because the pieces are not sturdy or securely attached to each other.
2,Fragile,The bird feeder looks like it's shown. Good capacity and design. The clear plastic is poor making the product very fragile. Might crack while assembling. I would spend a little more and get a product that would last.
2,Those pesky squirrels!,"It took the squirrels about two days to figure out they could chew through the plastic perches, resulting in seeds spilling all over the ground. One of these days I'm just going to set up squirrel traps and make myself a nice stew!If you could hang this feeder somewhere that the little buggers couldn't reach it, perhaps from a long rope off of a tree branch, then I think this feeder would work perfectly and be a wonderfully cheap alternative to all of the $50+ feeders on the market. However, if there's even a chance a squirrel can get to it, don't waste your time and money- buy a better quality feeder!"
5,Good product,"I ordered this feeder for my Gardman Wild Bird Feeding Kit. It was a breeze to put together and looks cute hanging on my feeder pole. Only drawback is, because it's so long, the deer in my backyard easily tip it over to get the seed. Oh well, they're hungry too. I would recommend this product."
2,Squirrels Like It Too,"I bought this at Target a few weeks ago. It took the birds a week to find it and then it was great. They came and ate and since we hung it on a tree right outside our window, my kids had a great view of the birds and saw many different kinds lined up trying to get a seat at our restaurant. Then, the squirrels found it. It was cool to see a squirrel up close too, until we discovered that the squirrel ate through the plastic causing all the seed to pour onto the ground below. We tried plugging up the holes, but the squirrels figured out how to chew through that too. Since we live in Chicago where the city rats are legendary it is not a good idea to have a pile of birdseed on the ground right next to the foundation of our building. I guess I'll be spending a little more money on a feeder if I want to continue to bird watch."
2,Squirrel Proof?,"This feeder is far from squirrel proof. I have pictures made with my phone of a squirrel hanging upside down- eating away! He even ate the plastic and ""branches"" where birds would sit.Rm"
3,had one for years,"I have had this feeder for about 5 years now, it has never fallen apart. I don't know what the other people are talking about-wobbling-if its hung on a tree or pole hook it swings a bit but how does a hanging bird feeder wobble? Anyway its not the best made on the market, but the birds seem to like it. It is a pain to take apart to clean and it should really have metal perches instead of plastic. The squirrels have gnawed off two of the perches since they hang upside down and eat the Safflower seeds (even tho they are not supposed to like it)I am ready to replace it now-but will be looking for a feeder with the metal perches instead."
2,how much?,I have this feeder. Why pay this much when you can buy it at Wal-Mart for $4.98 ? We end up with half the seed on the ground underneath it. Birds seem to like it though.
5,Great for Apartments,"I have this feeder placed right outside my window of my ground floor apartment. I originally got it for the cats' entertainment, and am glad I did.I originally had a feeder bell hanging from the second floor apartment's balcony, but decided it wasn't enough.I purchased this feeder for the sparrows and used the cheapest bird feed available. After I switched to sunflower seeds only I am now getting sparrows, finches and starlings. The down side being that the perches were not designed for starlings so they have to reach around to one of the other holes to get their food.Anymore, I can get 5 or so on it at once with two or three hanging out on the chain it hangs from waiting in line.I really love this little feeder and have had it since December '08. Never once had a problem with squirrels, but it may be because of the way I have it set up."
1,You get what you pay for,This lasted for about three days. It completely cracked apart and went in the trash after that. Don't waste your time--you're better off with a better-constructed feeder.
1,Poorly constructed feeder,This feeder lasted just a few days in our garden. Birds didn't seem to want to perch on the rods provided and the first squirrel to visit the feeder ended up destroying it. Not recommended.
1,Disappointed to say the least,"I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds. I knew instantly this was a mistake, but thought I would give it a try. One lasted only a few days at best. A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground. Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground. The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps, but again, the same thing happened. Food everywhere and a useless feeder. I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience. Sorry to have to give it a one star, but I can't find a reason to even go for two."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This feeder did not even last a week. It only lasted about three days. The squirrels knocked it off the tree and knawed off the plastic handle. It is now sitting in the recycle bin. I did not expect this feeder to last long, but hoped it would last at least a few months. If you live in an area heavily populated with squirrels, I advise you not to buy this feeder."
2,Perches Fall Off Without Glue,"Just received and looks acceptable and feels sturdy. But, the ""perches"" - where the birds sit - don't stay in and slide right out by just tipping the feeder a wee bit. Certainly any moderate wind would throw the perches right out. I had to use Elmers Glue to glue all the perches into place. I was looking for a feeder that didn't drop seed all over the gravel below. In this feeder, there is no ""lip"" at the bottom of each feeder hole to prevent seed from dropping out. We just had our yard landscaped and our old bird feeders, although they had ""troughs"" around the perimeter, still dropped seed on the gravel. As a result we now have sprouts of green coming through the gravel below our bird feeders. So, looks like we're back to square one."
4,"good, classic, inexpensive feeder","a good feeder for basic needs. It is plastic so when the seed runs out, you need to take it down or the birds will peck at it until it breaks. At least the high maintenance birds here in Minnesota :-)"
2,I'm replacing it,The finches love it. Somehow the seed always dumps out. A jay pecks at the plastic seam from his perch on the pole it's hanging from. So I don't know if the seed is coming out the seam or some bird somehow flips a port way open.
5,Deanainpc,"As always, I am very satisfied with my purchase(s) from Amazon. I feed birds year-round, and need feeders that will last,and can be cleaned from time to time. These fit the bill, and are very affordable.Also, the perch is too small for large birds such as Crows."
5,Always the best work!,"This song is great! 'N SYNC produces the best songs and people can never get sick of any of 'N SYNC's songs! They are the best group in the whole world, so buy this cd."
4,"""Great Book""","Aaron Marcus did a great job with this book. It is well written, has facts about the industry, shows you a step by step guide to entering the commercial modeling field in depth and have several references to contact to begin your journey. Images are included as well and this helps with a visual understanding about what is expected of models. His Style is very clear and straight to the point just how I like it, no sugar coating."
1,"Over priced, not very useful for anyone outside America","i was willing to pay the price of the book if it would bring success as it advertised and with the many positive reviews i felt i couldn't go wrong. The book did contain some useful information, but nothing which i hadnt previously read in a much cheaper book.i agree with a previous reviewer in saying that some of the reviews may actually not be genuine!Personally i would recommend the work of Eve Matthewson- great book!"
4,Commercial modeling advice,This book was full of helpful knowledge and ideas. The only thing negative would be that some of the topics were out of date. Technology advancements have changed some of the processes.This book is still certainly still worth purchasing as it has a wealth of information that will be timeless.
1,How to Become a Successful Commercial Model: The Complete Commercial Modeling Handbook,This book is NOT worth the money that the publisher has set. The Complete Idiot's Guide to being a Model is $10 cheeper and ten times better.
2,"Not that great, but what else is there?","I wish there was a good book about commercial modelling out there. I guess this is as good as it gets, its a little helpful. And yeah, I think its a little suspicous that every one who liked the book says its the greatest book ever, without saying one bad thing about it, and almost all of them are other authors or anonymous or at least have'nt commented on any other books but this one."
3,It's alright,"I have read hundreds of books on fashion, modeling, and photography. I saw this one and thought ""hmmm I havn't read this one yet"". Well, it was written very well and everything in it is true. If you already know a great deal about the industry or feel that you do....then don't buy this book. It's perfect for newbies though. I honestly only learned one thing from it. That's not always a bad thing though! I mean if I never read this book.........I would of never known that one thing :)"
5,Very Helpful for a Modeling Career,My son is an aspiring model and actor. We attended a very informative class that featured Mr. Marcus. He covered a wealth of information on how to succeed as a professional model - things that it may have taken years for us to learn on our own. There was so much information that we felt that his book was a must. We refer to it often and recommend it highly.
4,Kissing the Rain,"I read this for a Lit Circle, and I must warn you: this book IS confusing. If you are looking for something easy to understand, then stay away. But if you are looking for something that makes you rethink how life is, or maybe even relate to, then this is alright.Moo is fifteen, fat, and goes to the bridge to get away from The Rain, which is what he calls it when he gets bullied. One night, he is watching the traffic down below and thinking in his head, and listening to the swooshing, and he witnesses a murder. So now he's stuck between the truth and lies, and he basically has nothing to do and no way to know what's right and wrong.I suppose the way it's written, which to me sort of reminded me of a journal entry, can be annoying at times, but it is interesting to hear Moo's tale."
1,What a book,"It was very weird because he never used proper English and always said cos instead of because and there are so many random words that have been fully capitalized. I still have not finished the book but it takes a while for me to read it because of the confusing plot. Recently a couple times I have had to re-read the part before so I can understand it. In my opinion, if you are looking for the intense book that the back says you will be fooled. I went into the bookstore and read the back and thought it looked interesting, but when I got home and began reading it...it was a totally different book than it says. Do not buy this book if your daughter or son likes suspense book because it isn't."
3,WHAT HAPPENS?!?!?!?!?,"THIS IS A GOOD BOOK, WITH A GOOD PLOT, BUT I WAS DISSAPPOINTED THAT I SPENT 4 DAYS READING IT AND NOT GETTING TO KNOW WHAT MOO CHOOSES IN THE END. THE BOOK MADE ME THINK, BUT IT CONFUSING IN SEVERAL PLACES."
3,I don't recommend this,"It had a good storyline but the narrative is like the 15yr old fat boy is talking to you and he will repeat questions over and over and just be like ""what are you gunna do bout it? there aint nuthin you can do bout it"" and it gets quite confusing at points. even if you do get through the writing like i did the ending is absolute CRAP it does not resolve ANYTHING and not in a hmm good ending i wonder what happened way.. it was a WHERE IS THE NEXT CHAPTER?? way. i was pissed that i spent over a week reading the story to get NO resolution"
3,rim destractive,"the rim of the keyboard which makes it a case, is not easy on small hands. It cuts into my wrists, but that may be my poor keyboard skills. It does work as wireless keyboard. I like using another style case so using the keyboard requires me to remove from the other case to use. I have long fingernails which makes using the onboard keyboard a real challenge so I do find the keyboard usefull for prolonged notetaking."
5,Awesome,Was very easy to connect to my ipad and it works great. I would tell anyone to ge this I love it
4,Good antenna,"well, this antenna is working good, the seller was kind of reliable! but they for got my invoice and i had problems with the company that bring it to me!!'cuz am not living in u.s.a!! but, the antenna is better than other! yes, it is... i recommend u to buy this stuff!!!its good!!believe me!!!!!"
5,Manikin Artist Helper CD At Amazon,This is a helpful tool for artists young and old. If you purchased a Manikin to pose for your figure painting this CD will help you to better understand how to use the Manikin to your best advantage. I purchased this in addition to the Manikin from Amazon for my grandson who loves to draw. My grandson says the CD makes it easier for him to understand the best way to use the Manikin. This is a smart purchase.
4,Szigeti: The Consummate Musician,"Perhaps far too big a man for the violin, Josef Szigeti compensated for his occasional scratches and wide vibrato with a musicianship second to none. To listen to his performances of Bach's fugues in this collection is a breathtaking experience - every voice, without fail, emerges to sing its theme and then falls back in favor of the next. It is as close to hearing the organ played by the violin as we will likely ever get. There is a superlative tenderness to the way Szigeti played Bach; anyone who can accept less than the golden tone of a Milstein or a Josh Bell will instantly fall in love with these performances."
4,Elmore most certainly knew Marvin was not a read person..,"arnabc is wrong to assume Elmore didn't 'get it' John Lurie was involved in the ""Get Shorty"" movie."
3,"Spoiled by its own ""joke""","One of the most fascinating, witty, sexy and wacky of John Lurie's albums. To bad he had to tarnish it with the absurb ""Marvin Pontiac"" hoax. Given the uncomfortable historic relationships between black and white musicians in this country -- it just ain't funny enough and veers dangerously close to blackface. But all us cool people are supposed to be too post- post- post- post-everything to fret about such uptight concerns. Yeah, right. If only he'd done it as an obvious, upfront lark in the ""Chris Gains"" mode, or just released the thing without the hokum cover story."
5,My Favorite CD of 2000 (So Far),"I'm not sure how many John Lurie fans were fooled by the initial hype surrounding this album, which purported it to be the recording of a musical genius who died in an asylum in the 70's. Lurie's voice is so distinctive that it was obvious that it was him singing, so perhaps Lurie fans were confused at worst. However, the album itself is fabulously entertaining, a total musical pleasure. Since the success of this album, a number of Lurie albums are being re-released, notably his soundtrack to his eccentric Independent Film Channel series ""Fishing with John"" and some past work with the Lounge Lizards. If you're just coming to John Lurie's work, you couldn't find a better place to start than with Marvin Pontiac, my favorite CD so far this year."
3,Kinda cool,"Despite the whole annoying hipster inside-joke aspect of this project, the music itself is pretty compelling. I dock it a star for representing itself as something it isn't - i.e., the recently-exhumed tracks of an insane old bluesman. It's a damn shame that John Lurie has to rely on such conceits to get people to pay attention to his music..."
5,A nice redesign of a classic watch,"I owned an original Ironman watch for years and liked it. This is an improved version one of the of the original ""sports watches."" Like the original, this one is very light although it's a little bulkier. The buttons on this one are much easier to press and seem more durable. The display is very easy to read and it has some type of reflective background that really makes the digits stand out. At night the Indiglo light is very handy. The Velcro strap is easy to put on and it has a little bit of stretch to it, You can fit it snuggly to your wrist but without it feeling constrictive. It's not the most attractive watch but it's ideal for sport activities or when you just need a basic, durable watch."
5,Perfect Watch!,I bought this for 10 year old for Christmas because he wanted a watch that had all of these gadgets. He just loves it! He's had it 6 months. There's never been a problem with and he only takes it off to get in the shower. It's wonderful! If it can last the beating a 10 year old can give it I'd say it can withstand just about anything.UPDATE: My son is now almost 14 and still wears this watch daily. I've replaced the band once and he still loves it. The best watch I've ever seen...especially for the money.
2,Flimsy,"The front resin/rubber piece came off of mine after a year. The glue failed, and the so did the pins holding it on. I wasn't even doing anything at the time, just sitting watching TV. The cloth band also streches out where it attaches to the watch easily. I didn't, however, ever take it off in that year, but I would still expect it to last better."
1,poor,The material was not glued well to the bottom of the shoe. The boots ripped while I was first trying them on.
4,Good but...,"I liked this DVD, but there are some things that i wish had been here:No clipped matches- You hear the commentators say ""What a match"" but if you haven't seen the match before, it's clipped so you can't really agreeChristopher Daniels vs Samoa Joe vs AJ Styles unbreakable match- Unbelievable match that deserved to be here with them showing the entire thing, that match happened way before this DVD was releasedOverall, good dvd, but buy it only if you can find it for cheap"
3,"Just a question, not a review yet...","I pre-ordered the DVD, and I'm just curious if all the matches on the dvd are clipped. It would a real shame, because Daniels has had and continues to have some amazing matches. Thanks."
2,TNA Drops the Ball....,"That's right people, TNa dropped the ball when they released this wrestling clipped matches on this bad DVD release. Now I watched TNA wrestling back in the beginning of 2004, and I was EXTREMELY dissapointed to see all the matches in 2003 on this DVD release begin clipped to 5 minutes AT THE MOST in some areas.Don't waste 15 bucks on this DVD, if it's more than just 10 bucks you are wasting money. It's a shame though, Christopher Daniels deserved better.......PS: At least World Wrestling Entertainment can put on a good DVD release...."
3,decent but not great,so while they claim that you can use the guide to sharpen at 7 different angles you really cant. you can only use 5 of them properly with a knife with a blade with of less than 2 inches. my knife has a Kershaw Shallot has a blade edge that is 16 degrees. while trying to use that angle on the guide it only hits the sharpening stone and throws off the angle. if you use it free hand it works great but the guide is useless with a blade that doesn't have a lot of width.if you can prove me wrong on this please let me know. id be willing to find out how to do it.
1,Cheaply made piece of junk,"I bought this for my husband at one of the big knife websites, and it broke while he was adjusting it to use for the first time. It is very flimsy and made almost entirely of weak plastic. I would not recommend it for anyone. I only gave it one star because 0 stars was not an option."
1,seller has problems,"Item was described as 4 refills per case. It also stated in stock - still does. Seller sent me 1 with no other explanation. I emailed, they apologized and refunded me but I really need the product. Have not heard from them since. I don't think they really know what they are selling - probably drop-shipping."
5,Just what I am looking for!,"I have this dispenser for this product but couldn't find the refill for it, and I didn't want to purchase another dispenser so I searched the refill online found the best price here and bought them, you can not get them in the store ""anywhere"" so I am happy to have finally found them and at a great price!"
1,not working properly,"Hello, i just receive few days ago because i'm from canada and my parent just came back to florida. So when i try to plug in my nokia phone the pin to connect is a little bit to tall. I think 2-3 mm so when the pin is in the phone i dont ear anything but if i pull out a little bit i'm able to ear. It's very hard to find the right head set for this phone. I buy almorst 5 different kind and all of the doesn't working."
4,Worked as expected,"I bought these for my Nokia 2610. The headset performed as I was expecting, giving me a freedom of a handsfree and at the same time are cheap to have. I will surely recommend these for Nokia handsets, not having a bluetooth in them."
3,Here is my opinion...,"Okay, I just got this CD and I think that it is good. But the Interview doesn't sound like N Sync. They have like deeper voices. But it is a good CD. I like it!"
1,really bad boy band music!,this song gets on my nerves and i cannot stand it! listen to sevendust instead!
1,Bad Bad Product,"I brought it and I just had it professional installed and the included wrench would not fit the blue canister and the red relief value on top leaks a bit. Stay completely away from this product and company. If I could rate it below zero, I would have. In addition, the included filter it comes with is the cheapest replacement filter the store had for it. I have big regrets."
1,you do not this book,"I bought this book when I was taking my first EE class, intro to EE and I can give you advise that you do not need this book."
5,Great sound,"While recorded in 2001, this album hearkens back to the great jazz of decades gone by. A lot of recent jazz music seems to just be empty... it doesn't ""say"" anything, if you will. Sonny Rollins and the band assembled here use their instruments to take the listener on a journey, expressing both the sorrow of the 9/11 attacks and hope for the future.A great sound, and one of my favorite jazz recordings."
4,Sonny Sounding As Good As Ever,"This recording captures Rollins at his inspired, melodic best. Providing the backing for Rollins to explore every nook and cranny of each song's melody is a somewhat-unusual backing group consisting of trombone, guitar, electric bass, drums and percussion. Rollins has traditionally eschewed the piano, dating as far back as his infamous A Night At The Village Vanguard record from 1957, which allows him to explore with greater ease the melodic capabilities of each song. I'm not particularly fond of the electric bass, especially in an otherwise acoustic jazz setting, and especially considering Bob Cranshaw's considerable tallents on the double bass. But that minor detail is quickly forgotten, as Rollins plays an inspired set during a time that he and the audience both were in need of some musical healing. And Sonny delivers, as always."
2,"is it just me, or is sonny rollins not good at jazz anymore","his sound is not so good and his ideas do not come out all that well. he has not sounded good in quite some time, he is a mere shadow of his former self. if i heard this saxophone player and i did not know it was sonny rollins then i would not like it, i would say maybe he is still getting his stuff together but also he sounds like he is doing it on purpose, going for something that is not worth going for. do not spend money on this please, but some wayne shorter or lee konitz if you want to hear an old guy play good jazz, just not listen to sonny rollins honk his way through imitations of old favorites."
4,This Version Works for Me,"I had been familiar with Hamilton Harty's arrangements of Handel, but it wasn't until maybe three decades ago that I first heard the Irish Symphony on the radio. Lush and evocative, it has enough atmosphere to give CPR to several other pieces, one after the other. This recording, with the cherished pairing of the Ulster Orchestra and the late Bryden Thomson, is a real gem in my view. There is a more recent recording on Naxos that has garnered some praise, but I've not heard it and so can't compare the two. All I can say is that this rendition seems so right that I don't have much desire to look elsewhere for any other that might be superior."
5,listen to it all the time,I really like this album. Listen to it all the time. I listen while I making dinner. I listen while I'm driving. It is so good.
5,Micoscopic Camera Bag,"I took a chance in buying this bag because I was looking for the most compact bag I could find to fit my Fujii FinePix 6800, however my camera was just too wide. Fitting the Fujii 6800 in this case was like having a Sumo Wrestler squeeze his way into a GEO METRO. I give this bag a 5 star rating because it is very well made, and I cannot blame anyone but myself. Even though I could not use this bag for my Fujii, I have found that it is perfect for my camera acessories. I use it to store batteries, memory cards, battery charger, and cleaning supplies, so it is a great utility bag for my usage. If you own a Canon Elf S100, this bag will fufill your needs, as it will fit like a glove."
3,Misleading item,"As previously stated, this is a remaster of a previous Vinyl LP. It is a very SMALL improvement of the previous CD, MCAD 37252, ASIN No. B00000DWHI. Failing to hear a significant difference on my stereo, I used Sonic Foundry's Sound Forge Studio to measure it. At best, it is a 10% improvement. I recommend against replacing your current CD if you already own MCAD 37252."
3,Neil Diamond - 12 Greatest Hits,The best Greatest Hits album of Diamonds career. It doesn't have the live versions of Holy Holly or Sweet Caoline like the vinyl album and tape had. That's a negative. They are way better than the studio recordings.
4,Good with various & different emotion,"The CD had a broad volume of talent that had different taste of emotion and feeling all the way within it.Romance,love,loneliness were just a few thoughts that are brought to mind when hearing this mellow pop CD."
1,Nothing Original,"I have this album (vinyl) and every song is a cover. The singing is OK, but I'm not surprised that the 5 sellers only want from $1.65 to $2.98 for it."
2,misinformation,"Beware! This CD is a classic example of false advertising as perpetrated by the stellar individuals who run the music industry. While there is no indication whatsoever on the outside or inside packaging, two of these ""greatest hits"" are in fact live versions: i.e., ""Sweet Caroline"" and ""Holly Holy."" This is ridiculous, and both the record company (MCA) and artist (Neil Diamond) should be chastised for such blatant misinformation. Having said that, the rest of the CD is fair. Typically, it features its share of Neil Diamond schlock (e.g., ""I Am ... I Said""), while ""Cracklin' Rosie"" and ""Shilo"" remain shining examples of his long-forgotten pop-songwriting capabilities."
3,pretty good compilation for its time,I own the LP record of this album and i think somebody else who reviewed it doesn't because they said that sweet caroline and soolaimon were live. Right about the former but not the latter. Holly Holy is live and not a bad live version either. Anyway i see the point people have made about Neil's greatest hits albums containing live versions. This was made by MCA and all the versions should be studio as it is not a live album. Since this came out in the age of vinyl i suppose 12 songs was the most they could fit and its a pretty good 12 songs. Although when it was released on CD they should have added bonus tracks like Atlantic did with Rod Stewart best of Vol.1 and 2. Instead MCA just released a separate album called the Neil Diamond Collection which has all these songs plus five more from that era and the Hot August Night version of Cherry Cherry. I give it 3 stars because of the live tracks and because they did not add anything on CD
1,Doesn't work,"Looks great, just like the picture. Will not spill, drip or leak when closed. BUT, will not give up coffee when in open mode either. Actually it will dribble some out when you tip it way back, and then release a lot once you've got the thing tipped almost vertical, and then it sloshes on your upturned face. HOT! The only way to get the coffee is to take the top completely off. We'll be returning ours and hoping for a refund or replacement.3/7/11 We did find an adjustment screw, as one reviewer mentioned. However, if you back it off from where they tightened it at the factory it won't stay put, either loosening further, or tightening itself down again. All in all, it's billed a TRAVEL MUG for Pete's sake! Adjustment screws? Really?"
2,Did not meet my expectations,"I purchased this mug to replace an older model of Trudeau Mug, which was amazing but was getting old. I purchased the mug in June 2007 -- 2 months later the bottom of the mug started leaking! The older model was much better!"
1,"frustrating, poor design.","Like the other reviewer said, it is tightly sealed, no spill whatsoever, but coffee only drips out soooo slowly when opened! You ended up trying so hard to sip it all the time, and quickly find yourself just sipping mostly air! Tried adjust the screw so that the opening can be a little wider, but it doesn't help. Also, other mugs with one-hand operation would be much better than this design, which you'll need two hands to open/close it. Returned for a refund."
2,LEAKY,"I have several different brand of mugs. This is my least favorite. This one always leaks on me. Also, as pointed out by another reviewer, the base is too narrow and it topples from side to side in the car. You can do better."
2,leaked,"I liked the appearance of this mug but unfortunately the seal at the bottom comes loose and water or other fluid leaks out the bottom, this only happened after a month of use."
1,poor quality,after a week or 10 days i had to send back the top as it all feel apart.after receiving the new top.it didn't fall apart but leaks from the high lip side.looking for a better mug.
4,Great gift,"This was a great gift for my husband who drinks a lot of coffee. I don't like that the lid is uncleanable, I'm still trying to figure out a way to get it really clean. I also think that the wave in the lip of the cup is oddly positioned. but it's not my mug, and the hubby seems to like it just fine."
4,Great coffee cup!,The handle is way too long and it isn't dishwasher safe . . . But I do like the cup for the price. It has been a great way to transport my daily cup o' joe!
4,"Good mug, does the job ~ wishing for dishwasher safe","Good travel mug for hot drinks, doesn't leak and is easy to handle. The only drawback is that it's not dishwasher safe."
5,Wonderful!,"Monica brings life and joy to the topic, and her choices are delicious! This book should be a staple in every kitchen. It's also an excellent gift."
5,Everything Indeed,"I am so happy to have found this book. I have been too intimidated to cook from most comprehensive Indian cookbooks because the ingredient lists are so daunting, yet every page comes with stern incantations to do everything from scratch. Bhide still makes the case for honest from-scratch meals and spice mixes, but she also includes storage tips for those who don't use garam masala etc. every day. Reading Bhide I feel like I have a kind and patient friend at my side, who makes even the most obscure recipe fun and approachable. I recommend it to anyone looking to get started in Indian cooking."
4,LOVE FROM INDIA,This was book that takes METO INDIA I WOULD TELL EVERY BODY ABOUT THIS BOOKA. A MY. KID LOVE THE FOOD
5,The Best,"If you want a definitive Indian Cookbook with traditional methods, look no further than this book. It is fantastic - I use it all the time!"
4,Simplicity at its best,"To keep up with my frantic pace of life and the desire to have a variety in my meals I am constantly looking for an easy to follow recipe book and this book does exactly that. I cook all kinds of ethnic recipes and whenever things seem too foreign or exotic I loose interest. Bhide's book is straight forward and I like using it.Although I am also a big fan of Jaffrey's books I think your previous reviewer is pretty vicious to discard Bhide's book because of its simplicity and low price. Bhide has written a very concise book with just enough details on the techniques and her little tips on the side bar are a welcome change from the other story telling Indian cookbooks.From Bhide's book I made Chicken Korma, Cucumber Coolers and the Tricolor Rice for a dinner and everyone loved it. I would recommend it to whoever wants to cook a good Indian meal without sweating it too much and ultimately giving it up.Bhide you are on to a very good start. Congratulations."
2,Samosa recipe?,"I was very surprised to see there was no samosa recipe in this book. Its the most famous of all Indian cuisine, and she doesn't put it in the book??"
1,Sad!,"Not recommended as a Indian cookbook of our times.These are recipes that do not work in the kitchen.Many are not even accurate to the names of dishes they represent from India.Think twice and hard before buying this book.There are a few Indian cookbooks out there these days that have finally made Indian food accessible in a fresh way, try them out."
1,Where are the bones?,"Maddhur Jaffrey and Monica Bide, two authors whose books I bought, are so very different in how they share the Indian repertoire with the cookbook readers.Bide it seems has put together a collection quickly, or maybe using what is available in India, and with some additions of the moment. Jaffrey has shown research and respect for a culture she has been separated from for a while, and has studied from a distance forever.The result, Bide's book seems amateur at best, failure when recipes do not taste or come out as one would expect after having cooked the same dishes from recipes from other Indian cookbook writers. The price is low, maybe that factors in for untested recipes.Use Bide's book as one of many you have to look at for ideas. Beware of relying on this book for recipes that you show off for a special gathering. You are in for setbacks.In all honesty, I have not yet bought Bide's previous book, but after this purchase, I am not sure I will."
4,Much better than all that,"Disclaimer: Monica is a colleague of mind. Pedantry: If Monica were reviewing your book, she would spell your name right. Particularly if the name were found, y'know, right there on the same page where you type the review.It's a tough trick for a cookbook to pull off to strike a balance between painfully authentic and complicated recipes (this kind of cookbook is important, of course, but mostly for reading in bed) and dumbed-down recipes that substitute ketchup for tamarind. Monica's book walks that line -- this is a nice collection of scrupulously tested recipes (the lead recipe tester is also a colleague of mine).I like Madhur Jaffrey's books, too. I don't see why one has to be good and the other bad. To the negative reviewer: when you critique recipes, you need to be specific, or it doesn't help anyone."
5,Fantastic follow-up!,"It's just a tad slower than ""You Were Here,"" but just as good if not better! Includes the hit song from the soundtrack of the motion picture Men With Brooms: ""Silver Road"" and a fantastic version of the Weeping Tile song: ""Came on Lion."" Overall the album is very polished but not ""over produced."" This album proves that Sarah is truly an artist in every sense of the word. So buy this album, sit back, and let its beauty take you over."
4,"Not the best, but still great","I own every Sarah Harmer and weeping tile album ever produced. Sarah is an excellent musician, with great talent. Her songs are heartfelt and strong, and still simple and pleasing. However, All of Our Names is not my favorite of all of her releases. The songs are not as catchy, and they sound more mainstream. There is less definition and fewer differences between the individual songs than on her previous albums. To me, this makes it sound like the whole CD is one song, which I don't like. If you are looking for a mainstream-sounding adult alternative pop album, buy this CD. However, I prefer her older album, You Were Here, because the songs feel stronger and more defined. If you do not own any Sarah Harmer CDs, I would recommend first Buying You Were Here. This is still a great album and should not be missed, but it is not as good as her previous works."
4,"Elegant melodies, well recorded, terrific lyrics","Sarah Harmer has a real knack for describing everyday scenes and emotions with a wry humor and sometimes stark realism. The backing of her band lays down unusual, sometimes sparse, sometimes thick underpinnings for the songs that make the whole thing just, ... clean and beautiful. These are songs you don't get tired of. These are songs you enjoy more, and hear more IN, each time you listen to them.I'm a huge fan of Kathleen Edwards, and I'd still have to give her the nod because she has a bit more ability to spice up her song mix with more rocked up tunes. But this is an excellent CD. I also have ""All of Our Names"" and, like some other reviewers, don't understand the knocks about this one being a step down. If anything, I like this one more."
2,Let's start with the good.,"Her first album is great. Ok, now that we've got that out of the way... I'd call this record 2004's first great disappointment. This is one of those total bummers where you've looked so forward to the album, and then when you actually buy it and hear it and it's over you think ""Phew. I'm glad that's out of the way."" And you stick it under H in your collection, waiting for the day that you might ""get it"", even though you suspect that day will never happen. I guess I have to applaud her for trying to break out a little, but there are just no hooks here for me. I wish the news was better, but from my perspective, it really isn't."
3,"Musically bland, interesting lyrics",A bit disappointing after everyone's raves. Reminiscient of the Indigo Girls but lacking some of their energy.
3,Bible?,Found a few incorrect things in the book as it relates to operations masters. Not sure I would rely on the information as a study book. Has a few good tips though. Leaves out detailed information in some areas. Most likely will return the book.
1,Not worth the money!!!,"This is by far the most disorganized book I've ever seen! Pg. 298 talks about burning in a new server before setting up the Active Directory, and for this it says, ""you can use Backup/restore as discussed in Chapter 5."" So I re-read Chapter 5, and there is NOTHING on this Bup/restore method for burning in the server. Also, on pg. 298 it talks about the procedure described in appendix B. Well guess what... There is no appendix B!!! There is only a single appendix that explains the contents of the CD, and nothing else!!! I wish I had seen a review like this one before wasting my time and money on this book!!!"
2,Is there a strap needed too?,"This watch seemed too good to be true, so I checked the Timex web site. The heart rate manager only works when an included chest strap is worn. Not as convenient as a watch that works as an HRM.I can only assume that this model needs the chest strap, though there is no mention on the product description."
1,I was excited,"I was very excited about this product when I placed my order, thinking that it would help my workouts be more effective. I purchased it new thinking that I would have better luck than if I purchased a used watch. However when it arrived there were no instructions included with the watch. I would imagine that it could be difficult enough to program with instructions. However without instructions programming was virtually impossible. I must return the item."
1,Don`t expose this tent to the heat!!,"I was 400 miles from home when I went camping and found out that the heat in the car caused the poles to snap,crackle and pop!!! Don`t expose this tent to extreme heat!"
5,This is Alan Silvestri's best work!,"Unfortunately, this movie wasn't as well known as the first, but it was better in it's own way. First of all, most people thought that the storyline was too complicated. It is not! Second, it had a great score that was accompanied by great music tracks that supported the plot. It also was a great movie experience although it was released four years after the original BTTF. If this soundtrack had been expanded with more tracks, it would rock! But it still does even without certain tracks. BTTF rules!!"
4,Excellent for a myriad of uses.,"I purchased this CD just after a trip to Sri Lanka, where I saw the film in a camel drive-in theatre with cous-cous beverages and olive-leather blanket seats. It was one of the greatest decisions I have made since moving all my underclothes into a tiny red wastepaper basket. I listen to it now while I wax my car with 'I Can't Believe It's Not Car Wax'. Do not ask me for details - simply allow me to say that this CD will change your soul for eternity. Dr. Brown is quite the delectable dish, no? Hhee hhee hhee."
2,A long wait for a pointless resolution,"The book was interesting to start, but it became pretty obvious that it was just edging along to resolution that when it finally came was obvious and disappointing. It also left a huge number of aspects raised in the story with no resolution at all, pointless or otherwise."
3,"Amnesia, perfect, Mr Neiderman has forgotten the ending.","Mr. Neiderman keeps the interest of the reader throughout the novel, with clues and innuendos, only to discourage the reader with useless information that didn't lead to a conceivable conclusion. What a disappointment."
3,not as good as the first but interesting,"The second book in the series is interesting, but it goes too far in making pessimistic assumptions about human interaction, and the characters are not really believable."
5,A terrific sequel to a terrific book.,"""Beggars and Choosers"" is the sequel to the fascinating book ""Beggars in Spain"". It is every bit as good as ""Beggars in Spain"", and presents a plausible yet fantastic set of subsequent events. Like ""Beggars in Spain"", the characterization is as good as the plot, and a variety of political and science themes are explored.My only reservation about this book is that I would recommend reading ""Beggars in Spain"" first."
3,"NOT AS GOOD AS ""DIAMOND AGE"" NOT AS BAD AS ""INNERVERSE""","Overall, not a bad book. Not a great book, but not bad either. Read it if you have some spare time."
5,The BIBLE of the St. J&LC,"This is the Bible for the St. Johnsbury & Lamoille County RR. It took me months, many phone calls and internet searching,as well as having a small army of friends searching to find a copy of it but when I finally did it was well worth it. There are tons of great pictures. The book has the history of the RR. It also lists the equipment,when it was used and when it was retired. It has a list of the stations and the industries it served. It also has a chapter on the Hardwick & Woodbury RR which was connected to the St. J. To find this information in other sources would cost you tons of time and money.If you are interested in the St. J&LC this book is a must for you."
5,Natalie Cole - Ask a Woman Who Knows,"Natalie Cole is a class act.I loved this album. She is a great singer with terrific arrangements, and a great choice of songs. I would highly recommend this album. She can sing it all from jazz, ballads to swing. And, what a nice touch to do a duet with Diana Krall,...another class act."
4,Love this one!,I love all the panoramic puzzles from Buffalo Co. they are really easy to put together (2 hours and I was done) and they look so nice.I complete this type puzzles when I don't fill up to a challange nad just want to relax.
4,One of the best!,"This panoramic is definitely one of the most fun, and I've done them all. I hope they do an undated one of Times Square. I would also love one of Philadelphia, I can't believe they haven't made one yet!"
1,Cheap monitor for cheap,"Monitor supports maximum 75 hz refresh rate at 1024x768 instead of the usual ~85 hertz and it is on the small side measuring 15.7"" visually. Ever here of 4:3 perspective Samsung? You can't just make it wider you have to make it taller too."
1,Great monitor if you can find the driver,"Its a great monitor if you can find the driver. Which I can't. The samsung webpage crashes IE every link I click, and I've wasted an entire evening trying to find a driver for it and it still wont work.Im buying a different brand next time!"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON!!,"Here's why: I bought this to replace a monitor that seemed to be going haywire--turns out it was fine. I tried to cancel the order but wasn't permitted (it was too far in the process in less than 24 hours.) I didn't want to pay $40 tp return it so it sat for 3 months until I added a new computer for my business. After a week it started going in and out of focus, rendering it unusable. Although it was defective, Amazon wouldn't take it back (it was more than 30 days) and Samsung would replace it only with a charge of $40.The bottom line: $140 monitor I could have bought at the mall and returned for a refund, $70 in shipping and days of hassle. I am an Amazon stockholder and I hate to say it but I would never buy a monitor or any electronics this way again.As for the monitor itself, when it works--it's ok, nothing special and certainly not worth this aggravation."
3,"Flat screen, but weak picture quality","I am perplexed by the amount of high reviews for this monitor. I agree the screen is very flat, the text is clear, but it starts to suffer when changed to 1280x1024. I see little pixel-like squares in the outer edges of the screen, and the letters start to look blurry and the hz drops to only 60. It gets better when brought down to 1152x864 and the hz rating improves to 75...I am returning the monitor for something better as soon as I research one in the same price range."
4,Excellent Value,"For the price, this monitor is great. The color & contrast are spot on. I'm very pleased (My third Samsung monitor)."
1,Geometry problem,I have adjusted this monitor via the front control display over and over. The monitor has a slight vertical bow problem that there is no known to me adjustment for. The text lines do not appear to run perfectly straight across the screen. The monitor brightness is too bright even at minimum. I returned it.
5,"Samsung 753DF 17"" Dyna Flat Syncmaster Monitor","This is a fabulous monitor w/great color and dot pitch(0.20). I bought this monitor last month and has been running great. This is amazing monitor with affordable price. Comes with its own Software for custon setting the color, lumens etc. I certainly recommend this monitor if you are looking for one!"
2,"Great color, horrible geometry","The display is bowed down in the middle along the top edge, and angles up along the bottom edge from left to right. It could probably be adjusted to within tolerable limits if Samsung had provided a vertical pincushion adjustment in addition to the horizontal one (they didn't), and a horizontal trapezoid adjustment in addition to the vertical one (they didn't). Also, if the monitor is shut off for a while (like overnight) and turned back on, the colors are faded until you shut off/turn on again. Since the nearest service center is 150 miles away, I'll be returning this one, and replacing it with one of a different brand that I can see before I buy it. Live and learn."
4,Pretty,This is a Great color! It is a little darker than I expected but it is a beautiful lilac color. Very pretty.
5,OPI did it again!,This is a great color. I have gotten many compliments on wearing it. People have said it reminds them of Spring and Easter. It's long lasting color and worth the price.
5,they are cool,"I saw them as a supponting band for Jack Johnson in Madrid (Spain)... they were playing with Matt Costa too... that night was great!!!A nice band, so far... let's see in the future."
2,Silly,"Pobrecito & Girl I Want to Lay You Down are the best songs. It's a silly album, but what do I know anyway?"
4,Fly Between Falls,"ALO, or Animal Liberation Orchestra, sound like a bunch of hippies. These hippies are totally cool!This is a surprisingly good CD. It's a re-release now on Jack Johnson's Brushfire label, so you know it's good. Jack even guests on the second track.The music is very chill and laidback, but a little more uptempo than Jack Johnson. It has a little funky groove to it.Although it does have some rather stupid lyrics at times, the music more than makes up for it. This is a really cool cd, perfect for hanging out. Recommended."
5,A must listen! Ever song great. If only there were 6 stars,"Love this. Try it if you like Phish, Jack Johnson, Ben Folds. Hard to describe, but always puts me in a great mood!"
3,"Aviation, Army style.","I found this book an enjoyable, light and easy read. FLYING THROUGH THE YEARS by LTC Bob LANZOTTI, 228th ASH Bn, is a chronological collection of short stories from three tours, one to Korea and two to Vietnam. The 'Crimson Tide' vet writes with a dash of humor blended well with recall and camaraderie that makes this book a quick read. FLYING THROUGH THE YEARS definitely gets a thumbs-up from me.Hank Llewellyn, Correspondent/SABER,1st Cavalry Div. Assoc."
3,Works Well,"This was easy to mount. However, the instructions for opening the combination were very confusing, but I eventually figured it out. On the downside, the lock is a little ""sloppy"" in that one need not be precise in moving to the next number in the combination - it will open if you get ""close enough"". Not necessarily a good thing."
4,Much better than the lower level filters,"These fit my regular mask and are much more efficient in filtering out fine particles than the smaller units that came with my mask. When mucking about in attics doing construction, this filter is very helpful."
3,"Cute, but runs big!","The costume is great. Quality material and really warm for the cold October nights. I got the 6-12 month size for my solid 9month old son, and it was really big on him. The hat was so big that it fit my husband's head! I had to have someone take it in, and sew it.. The 6-12mo would be great for a 1yo or older in my opinion!"
2,Not one I'll be keeping,"This movie made Andrew McCarthy out to be a hick from Georgia. His accent was so fake. And the story line was not believable. Kind of hard to follow in places. Although it is a decent film (no swearing or nudity), Not one I would recommend."
3,DVD review,Servoce was above great. price above great also. The movie was ok but not one I would watch over and over.
1,Heaven Must Wait,"Should be ""Everyone Must Wait"", Very Slow movie. I am an Andrew McCarthy fan, he has performed better in many other movies. This diamond in the rough, should have stayed in the coal mine. Gave mine to the trash man."
1,FAT CAT 6! DANGEROUS! Lost our boards on the freeway!!,"DO NOT BUY!!! Went on a snowtrip with my 3 other friends and they had bought this product. The way up it was okay.. but on the way home.. the rack broke. Mind you.. you might be thinking it was our fault.. buuut.. the way the boards went my board should've been one of the first boards to go because it was near the clamp.. but when heard this huge noise on our roof.. we looked up and my board was the last one on top and then it flew onto the freeway. It really was surreal! Thank God no one got hurt! But be wary of this product!! I had my board for 6 years.. my first board ever and I'm really upset it's gone. I wasn't planning on buying anymore snow equipment because I was happy with what I had. So if you really want this product.. take your chances with it.. I wouldn't. If i get a new board, it's staying in the car."
3,Just don't expect more than it delivers,"This is interesting if you are a Snead fan, but it is only marginally an instructional video. It is primarily a biography and swing-theory discussion with Snead. I was looking for a detailed analysis of his swing from his heyday, and that is really not what this is (although there are a fair number of clips from his heyday). It is quite long -- 105 minutes -- and well worth the money if you are interested in Snead's career. And there is a fair amount of swing information -- the title and cover simply misled me into thinking I was going to get a detailed analysis of Snead's swing. We do visit Snead's home, which is pretty interesting, and I must say that he comes across as far pleasanter than his reputation might lead you to expect."
5,Impoved My Swing the Same Day,"I stumbled on this video by accident, but it was my lucky day. Sam Snead does a great job of articulating not only the mechanics/fundamentals of a swing but how it should feel. Golf IS a game of feel first and fundamentals second. I'm in debt to Sam Snead and Jim McLean for making this video. I only wish it was a little more descriptive regarding short game vs long game. My family and friends have noticed a how much better I am this year. Watch the video with a club (I used a 7-iron) in your hand and try to think and feel what Sam Snead is saying."
5,How Cool!,This book is perfect for anyone who has a lot of questions about history! Everything is here including a break down of world history from the beginning to present day! It is fun to read and a great reference book. A college student must have (especially if you are a history major) and for anyone who is interested in history at all!
5,Very Informative,"This book gives you all the answers about almost anything you can imagine. From Drouts in the United States to who the ForeFathers of the United States were. I am always looking for new information, and always wanting my mind to grow, so this was a great book.In the very beginning it has a Timeline of World events which is very ""Handy."" It has information on wars I had never heard of, and plenty of information on Adolf Hitler, certaintly not my favorite person, but for writing a report on World War II, it was very nice to have around.I got this for Christmas, and started reading it that night, so you go out and get this book tonight."
4,Worked for me!,"The information in these books helped me pass the exam on the first try. I would study the material for each chapter, then study flashcards I made out of the multiple choice questions at the end of each chapter. Might not work for everybody, but it did for me!"
5,i do believe this is the way marketing (still) works,"at this point in time. some shifts in terms of brand disenchantment have been noted, but this is, in my opinion, still the way the marketing (customer's mind) works and how markete should go about putting their products in the market."
1,The Kindle edition is really bad,The publisher did a really lazy and sloppy work when preparing the Kindle edition. Typos and OCR errors everywhere. Poorly scanned pictures. Picture captions just pasted in the middle of surrounding text without any visual separation.
5,A must,I strongly recommend it as a must for those starting a career in marketing. It has everything it takes to introduce and elaborate the concept of positioning in the marketing today.
3,Kindle edition needs an editor,"The Kindle edition is full of typos, photos and captions that are out of order and a lack of punctuation. Lazy editing distracts from an otherwise good book."
2,outdated,"Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics. However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments. The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture. This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters."
3,Good for triggering conversation,A good quick read but nothing new for students of Consumer Behavior. The benefit of this book is vocabulary for bringing consumer perspective to the attention of the 4-P's mindset.
3,"Good information, but dated.","On a fundamental level, this book gives some good ideas on how a consumer views different brands, and how they may or may not be influenced by traditional advertising. However, since the book was written in 1974 the examples tend to be dated, and sometimes the predictions are contradictory to how an observed company actually succeeded or failed. These missteps tended to taint my view of the importance of the authors words. In the end, it did offer some interesting insights and contributed to my arsenal of marketing ideas."
3,"Okay, but the other one is better","I read this after 22 immutable laws of marketing. I would suggest getting that book over this one. A lot of the same ideas are presented, but I think 22 immutable laws is a much more mature and easier read book.The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing: Violate Them at Your Own Risk!"
5,A classic work of brilliance,This book is a key book in my library. I launched an incredible marketing campaign for my company using the contents of this book as my road map. It is simply a fundamental that must be read and understood by anyone entering the field of marketing. I consider this book to be both a classic and a masterpiece.
2,Uninspired,"This book could be useful if you've never taken a marketing course and you prefer to read at a junior high level (most sentences are about six words long). Like too many business books, the content in ""Positioning"" could have been condensed to a magazine article, making it about 200 pages shorter and much more compelling and pithy. Consider this book to be ""positioning light"", a collection of anecdotes and assertions. Look elsewhere if you want concrete examples supported by any sort of analytical rigor."
1,OLD school,"I wish I had known that this book was first published in 1981. If you look at the publishing date in the book it says copyright 2001, I think this is misleading. And talk about dated information. If you're looking for info on social networking, internet marketing or anything newer than 30 years ago, forget about this book."
4,great,"Once again, the point is clear: the brand naming process is critical for a co.'s bottom line. Easy read, a must for those interested in communication (most of you I would presume)."
3,"Great point, tedious presentation","The overall concept of the book is great. It makes you critically think about advertising, and exactly how to win over the consumer. The points were succinctly presented at the beginning of each chapter, but I felt that the book conveys a very repetitive nature with a lot of unnecessary filling between the key points."
4,A real American example of Positioning point by point,If you need an approach to Positioning with U.S. product examples this is your book
4,Positioing Needs Updating,"Jack Trout is a very good writer and has important insights about the importance of differentiation. I especially liked this book as the cases are very relevant.But many ideas are getting a bit dated. That being said, if you haven't read anything by Jack Trout or Al Ries then this book, or one of the aforementioned books, is essential reading for marketing and brand managers. An updated book would be High Intensity Marketing by Idris Mootee, an ex-Mckinsey guy. I also like George Day, the Wharton professor who wrote a few good books in postioning."
2,Save your money...,If you already own 22 immutable laws of marketing then this is really a relabelled book with the same exact information.
4,Interesting but not easy to implement,"After finishing this book I tried to think of how I can get some results from the author's insights. I think it's best implemented from the ground up for most people. Most of us don't have the position, power or energy to change a whole organizations positioning but you certainly can change your own positioning and your career path's too. Look to change from the client's point of view, not your own. That was a very interesting concept. Of course, you need to have a great plan on getting your client's POV in the first place in order to position yourself. In summary, the book has many great examples of what to do and what not to do and my conclusion was to work on myself first."
3,Enjoyable for the experienced too,Just read this book on vacation..Interesting to read examples from the 80's and see what has happened since. Over 2 decades in Marketing and still found it enjoyable.
3,Falls short....,"I think this book falls short of expectations. The contents covered by the author in the whole book could have been successfully covered in 5 pages. Any one with a little bit of marketing background will find it hard to learn anything new. Positioning is a big success factor in any marketing campaign, and this book doesn't cover the ""how to"" part adequately.Nevertheless, it's a very easy read and will take you about an hour to finish the book."
4,"as advertised, though.....","These work fine. Though not as sturdy as previously purchased brackets, they are listed as ""light duty"", so can't be blamed. Shipment was timely."
2,Crown Pulls OUT,"I got this watch because of the price and Indego feature. I refuse to pay big bucks for a timepeice that gets a beating. It has lasted 14 months which is longer than any other watch I've had. The crystal held up to some rough knocks. But the crown sticks out too far and finally got broken off.I will buy another Timex, but not this model."
1,Very Disappointing,"This book was very disapointing. When I got it I thought it will be so good but in fact it's boring and weird and not at all scary! Trust me, it's not as good as it appears to be!"
3,Charger,The charger works great. Good to have a spare charger for your PDA. The process of purchase was great.
1,This should have been good but,"The premise for th plot was good. The lead characters were attractive, but the writing and direction simply stank. The sound quality was abominable. Watching this movie I had the impression that no one really tried- it was just sort of slapped together haphazardly and with no real editing. I was disappointed."
2,I don't recommend,"I'm not hard to please when it comes to enjoying movies, but I felt like I had wasted some time after watching this one. I gave Outsourced 4 stars."
2,Not a flag,The detailed product description states that this ia a flag. In reality it is a 1 sided banner with the reversed image on the other side. Would not have purchased if this was stated. A little desepive.
4,Insightful!,"People with an intense interest in knowing all the details of action learning will find the answer to their prayers in this book. Author Michael J. Marquardt writes with the zeal of a revival tent preacher, filled with the sincere belief that action learning can help solve any problem, meet any challenge or achieve any aspiration. As he clearly explains, action learning is intended to build both knowledge and leadership. He sets out the steps your organization should pursue to implement action learning, and to use it well. He includes questions, checklists and extensive examples. All he omits are any caveats or cautions about this approach. He's a booster and an expert, just so you know where he's coming from. We recommend his manual to human resource professionals."
2,A Very Odd Book,"I do not reccommend this book. This is probably one of Miss Allen's worst writings. The plot is not very well thought out, and the writing is atrocious. The book has some very sick and disgusting sexual scenes, that will make your stomach churn. This book isn't for the faint of heart!"
4,almost perfect,"this album starts out perfectly and stays that way, up until the costanza song. it's strange that tricky chose her as the female vocalist on his latest ""vulnerable"" album, because her voice makes the entire thing sound like an obnoxious starburst commercial or something. i don't like her solo song on this album, and i could've done without the liz densmore song as well. the rest of the artists that he chose are perfect, in particular gregory isaacs, the beat, and especially the radanna song. the le tigre song is also a great choice because it is something that i never would have imagined tricky listening to, and his varied musical tastes blow my mind. this album leaps from genre to genre while still maintaining a dark feel (care of the smooth basslines carried through from song to song). i've been listening to this almost everyday on the subway, sometimes at work, and when i indulge in green sticky stuff."
1,this is utter crap,"if u buy this load of bullocks u r a fool, total waist of money.tricky needs to be kicked in the balls for putting this out."
3,Fairly happy,"I ordered this product the other day and for the most part, I'm fairly happy with it. I wish that it had the hole for the headphones on the left side where it is on the 80GB iPod - but that was easily rectified with a pair of sharp scissors. Also, people were complaining about it not fitting really 'small' arms - it also doesn't fit very well if you have larger arms as it just barely fits mine very very snugly. I wish they would have put a min/max arm circuference listing. I also needed to 'clean up' some of the excess plastic that was on the inside - but again, nothing that took more than an extra minute or two.Otherwise, the click wheel is easily accessed even through the plastic and it DOES fit very snugly, so I am not too worried about the iPod shifting or falling out. All in all, except for the few issues I have, I'm fairly happy with the quality of the stitching and the product and would recommend it to others."
2,Must be designed for an old version of the iPod,I got this unit and the hole for the headphone is in the center top of the iPod in stead of the right side top. The picture shows it but I did not notice it until I got the unit in. You can punch a hole in the right place but it compromises the water tightness of the armband which is part of the reason you would use it. I got it for my son and am not sure he has ever used it.
5,"I hope there's a volume on Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism!","This audiobook presents an excellent history of Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Protestantism, and Judaism with enough detail to satisfy the enquiring mind while not overwhelming the listener."
4,Fit good - looks nothing like photo...,Fit good and seems to work fine - not as pictured though - you get a rubber sleeve with that requires a tie-wrap (included) to secure...
3,Hope that parents don't really act this way,"It that time of the year, when the parents all around New York are trying to get their children into private schools and the Drager family are to get their daugther Zoe into high school. And what starts out a simple task will end up involving basketball, a cooking show and other tasks in the quest for an education.After reading book, I was really happy that I went to public school and ever had to deal any of this stuff. I have to say that will this book some what entertaining, it really wasn't that good. I found the character to be boring and I couldn't really relate any of them."
4,Easy Reading to Relax the Mind,"Like many of the ""Chick Lit"" books available today, ADMISSIONS served its purpose and more. It was hilarious (not to the point of laughing out loud) and reminded me of the multiple applications I've had to make for schools. Although, I certainly hope that if and when I do have kids, they'll take the bull by the horns so I don't have to do the footwork. It does raise a question though -if you were to consider this novel as real life (which, for the city and many of its suburbs, it is) -it makes one wonder how admissions process' will be in 10 years.Anyway, funny characters, funny names, read it in under an hour and I loved every minute of it."
4,Entertaining,"I thought this book was 100 times better than The Ivy Chronicles. This book at least gave you different points of view about the Admissions process. Were some of the people stereotypical? Sure. Is this the kind of book someone should get on a Politically Correct bandwagon and protest about? I don't think so. It's a light-hearted, fun, quick read and it's perfect for summer."
3,Inconsistensies abound...,"While the book itself is funny and satirical, the author fails to recall her own characters. For example: page 184 describing Max, Zoe's Public School choral mate ""With curly brown hair, pale-green eyes, and unblemished skin, his looks were as close to cherubic as was possible in a fourteen-year old verging on puberty."" Now, describing that same male character (Max) on page 258 ""her response was triggered not so much by the song as by Max, whose pale skin, dark eyes, and bee-stung lips reminded her of photographs she had seen of Michael at that age"".I was nestled in my couch, with my cat, thoroughly enjoying this woman's book when I stumbled upon this faux pas. Don't these people keep notes on their own characters? I had an image in my mind of Max since page 184... PALE EYES not DARK EYES. Please, Ms. Lieberman, do not take your readers for granted. You have been caught in a blunder. Your readers are not stupid!"
5,Admissions Frenzy!,"The book was a great light-hearted read, although a bit predictable. This book chronicals the trials and tribulations of three main characters, Pamela (The Head of the School), Sara (Head of Admissions for the School), and Helen (the mother of a 7th grader at the School). I thoroughly hated the character of Pamela, which was definitely what the author was going for, I really liked Sara, and the jury is still out on Helen. Sone of her actions were very questionable and I wish the way her situation had played out would have been different. Other than that, this was a good book!"
2,"If you have insomnia, read this...","It's a real snoozer. The subject matter sounded very interesting to me (I'm a public school teacher), but this book just didn't deliver. I found the main character annoying and lacking in just about any redeeming qualities. I really wasn't rooting for her at all. The author seems to have thrown in an affair to add to the plot, but I found that those sections left me feeling uncomfortable (and not in a thought provoking way; more like an ""eewwww"" way). I had hoped this story would be funny or a bit scathing. I found it to be lukewarm. Save your money unless you need a book to help you fall asleep; even then, I'd buy some Tylenol PM...it's cheaper."
4,Jamie,"Another great book about the folks who live in Visitation, NC. If you have enjoyed other Lori Foster books, you'll love this one."
2,Misleading cover and summary,"I bought this book after the design of the cover caught my eye, and the summary on the back sounded like an interesting romance. I didn't make it past chapter 2. The story didn't make sense. I came to amazon looking for a review or another summary to get me up to speed on the confusing story, where I discover it is book 5 in a series. That explained difficult-to-follow plot, but my second complaint is that nowhere on the book, the back cover, or the excerpt at the beginning (which is where, face it, many readers choose books, does it say the book involves necessary prequels or that there is any paranormal component. No offense, that is just not what I would choose, and I want my $6.99 back for having been misled."
5,Thank you,Very nice pass time book.I give it 5 stars..I like chick lit books when I do not have anything to do.Thank you.
5,Excellent Book,"I bought this as a gift and, of course, took the oppotunity to go through the book myself first. These are amazing pictures that tell the story of those that lived during a terrible era. Vishniac truly captured the story with his photography."
3,"I didn't read the book, but............","I believe I had Mr. Stahl as a martial arts teacher when I was 10 or 11 years old, in the late 1960's in Fair Lawn, NJ at his ""Amdo"" school. He was a very good teacher and quite a nice person. I just came across this book now, so I don't have anything to say about it, just that the author was know personally to me and was (and presumably is) a great guy."
3,"Good information, but difficult to use","As usual, the Jamisons convey encyclopedic knowledge of the art of grilling....and....as usual, their editors and publishers have produced yet another book riddled with bad page turns and a typeface that's hard to work from. I'd agree with the other reviewers that it is a good book, but if you're looking for one that's easy to open up and use, this isn't it."
1,This book is not as good as it needs to be,"First edition read from the library:This book is not as good as it needs to be. It does not examine technology failures and the internet and financial failure. The technology is the internet! The ""how to prosper afterwards"" is skant, and is just macro-economics based.This book is packaged like it is of interest to individual readers and and maybe pop-economists, but a reader would be better served by #1 reading about the real US Depression, #2 applying what they learn about causes for zero demand, current political and financial matters, #3 figuring about terrorism, information technology stability, hardware stability, human factors.This book does not serve it's purpose per the title and cover in my book."
2,"""Depressed After Buying the Book!""","I'm always ready to learn as much as I can about the economy, the Markets etc...and the premise for this book is not only interesting, but more than likely true. BUT! This should have been an article in a magazine, possibly a paperback...not a hardcover. If you want to research this subject (and save yourself the money!)copy and paste the title into a Search Engine and check out any discussions on this matter. Sign ME, Depressed"
5,Excellent,"Best book i have read since ""Irrational Exuberance""i would recommend it to those skeptics who do not believe that the new economy has changed the world and the economy as a whole"
4,A Sea of Wisdom....my new friend,"The Authors authenticate my Jamaicanness in speech, color, food and mood. A Sea of Wisdom is my new friend and I reach for it often to feel the Caribbean sea on my skin and taste the spices, to smell the burning cane fields and see the blue mountains blooming coffee, guinep, breadfruit, naseberry and rose apple trees...aaahhh.Being transported so suddenly to my childhood memories from the humor and appeal of reading a Sea of Wisdom on my morning commute, has really opened my eyes to the simplicity of the wisdom of the proverbs, which are still meaningful today in this beautiful city of San Francisco, I now call 'Home'.Growing up in a paradise like Jamaica is an unforgettable experience which is usually lost to my everyday life consciousness while living in a modern, vibrant American city. It is so spiritually and psychologically delicious to see my native language in print...Audrey Burgess, SF, CA"
5,Great Collection Of Steppenwolf's Greatest Hits,"This is a great collection of 'Great Hits' by Steppenwolf. If your looking for a good collection of their 'best' music material, I would recommend this album. It is missing several great song's from the band, but all in all, its a good greatest hits album. You may want to also check out ""Steppenwolf Gold - Their Great Hits"" & ""Steppenwolf - Rest In Peace 1967-1972"", the last one only available in album form, not CD."
4,Lancelot Red...,"This Papo Sir Lancelot is an finely detailed, well-painted little figure. He makes a great classroom display item for medieval units or literature and an imaginative toy for thoughtful, mature children. He's poised for battle and has a look of determination on his face. His silver ""armor"" offers the intriguing appearance of tiny chain mail. He goes well with the Chain-Mail Horse figure.Unlike many of today's chatty, busy, articulated toys, this little figure, who is frozen in his pose, requires the player to use his / her own imagination in the play time to make the character and story come to life. [Children with very short attention spans may not like this toy.]"
3,"Thankfully, they didn't stay back for long","Klymaxx was one of the seminal R&B girl groups of the 80s, and there is no album by them that can be considered completely worthless, but the freshness of their 80s albums was starting to grow stale here, and there isn't anything on this album as good a Klymaxx classics like ""Divas Need Love Too,"" ""I Miss You"" or ""Meeting In The Ladies Room."""
5,Such a Nice Young Man!,"Brett Leveridge is a terrifically funny writer; his prose is at once witty and engaging, the tales he spins warmly evocative and unforgettable."
2,The cruel courtship.,"I am so tired of this cliche in romance novels. The man spends most of the book hating the woman's guts, but seduces her anyway, because of their great ""attraction."" He also does this while he is technically involved with someone else. But she can't stay away and then he shows up and begs her to love him.But of course, they still sleep together and it's all happiness and love at the end. Left me sick."
3,"Slow down XP, does not work in Vista","The Amazon.com says it is Vista compatible, it is wrong. I installed it but it makes my vista business crashed!!! The system reports that there is big compatibility issues. Do not buy it for Vista!!"
5,Traces of Lies by Connie Yeager Rone,"Excellent, Suspenseful, Looking forward to next book in series."
4,A fairy tale life,"I sped through this book all in one evening. It was written in the mid-nineteenth century and its style is typical of that era. It is not a scholarly work, but has a beautiful sense of mystery and of the sanctity of Elizabeth's short life. St. Elizabeth was truly a fascinating person, and her story is right out of a fairy tale. Born a princess, she was betrothed and left her family when she was only four. She was married at 13, and enjoyed an extremely happy marriage until her husband was killed in the crusades and her mother-in-law threw her and her four children out into the snow on a winter's night. She eventually got her home and fortune back, but turned around a went to live in a shack and give all of her money away as alms. This is highly recommended."
1,Magnavox and grey vertical lines!,"I bought this thru Amazon and have had nothing but bad luck almost from the stat Grey vertical lines startes to appear, called cable to see if it was that, not no it's the TV gone bad, hard to watch the picture and very uneven viewing, warranty gone and if a repair guy came it would cost 1335.00 before he looked at and they say Magnavox is great for that. So I guess I leanred my lesson no more from AmazonI'll have to wait till if breaks complelty I paid close to 1000.00for this thing! UGH!!!!!!!!"
3,Good book,This is not one of my favorite books by Beverly. Only because it is hard to follow. One minute you are reading about Melissa and then the next chapter you are reading about Ryan.I also dont understand why everybook that Beverly writes is about the Amish. I really like her books. But I with that she would write something that doesnt talk about the Amish
4,!?!?!PAGES!?!?!,The book was awesome as always...but when I read it some of the pages were ripped! I had to guess what some of the words were!
4,Must read,"This is a really nice book, when I first bought it I thought it was going to be like all her other books but this one is different, not knowing ho to trust at first, trying to protect your husband by leaving him not knowing he is a part of the organization, pretty crazy stuff .....this is a must read book you will enjoy"
3,Atlantic sunset?,"Interesting book, intriguing plot twists albeit somewhat far-fetched in spots -- but what I really had a difficult time getting past (at the beginning and end of the book) were the descriptions of sunsets in the Atlantic Ocean...as viewed from the east coast of New England. I could see if the setting were the UK. I know a certain amount of research goes into writing books to make the settings authentic, but it's hard to fathom anything but sunrises coming out of the Atlantic. Surely between the two of them, Beverly or David should have caught that mistake."
5,The Sanctuary,"Idid enjoy it very much,but i though it was a continuation to The Redemtion of Sarah Cain"
4,Enjoyable reading,"This book was easy reading, with a good plot and some ""twists and turns."" Couldn't wait to finish it. I am very much interested in the Amish culture, so enjoyed references to the lives of the Amish men and women. Have read several books by Beverly Lewis and enjoyed them all."
5,Refreshing Manet,"This is a very well written book. It introduces a creative angle to the work of one of the most studied figures of the XIX French Art. Locke makes display of her profound knowledge of the Artist's work, of the time period and of the overall circumstances that surrounded one of the most important painters of modern art. Her insight and fine prose makes the book an easy read. I have read many works about Manet and, after a while, it becomes repetitive to read again and again recycled information. I found nothing of the sort with this book. On the contrary. Locke's insight is interesting, challenging, fun and sufficiently based in historical evidence to make of her argument a worthy read. This book is one of those valuable volumes that present art history at its best."
3,An ate-th as good as the first book,"""Traps Ate"" is not nearly as good as the first few books in the series; the traps in this one are sillier and thus less useful to a game master. I prefer the cleverer traps in the earlier books. The traps here tend towards excessive detailed overkill. Still somewhat humorous, but I'd guess most of the traps in this book are designed by younger gamemasters who are aiming for ridiculous ways to kill characters, rather than the very game-playable traps of the earlier books."
1,Disorganised and unhelpful writings! I really want a refund!,"Dont know whether the author had been too keen to show how good he wrote or to publish a new book or what, this book just lacked the substance to be useful on investment or trading. I doubt whether any reader of it can ""understand how markets really work and win the wealth game"" per book title by the very descriptive and insightless essays in unlinked chapters. I wonder why some referrals could praise it as an excellent Trading/Investment Psychology book. As a pro trader/CFA/trading book lover, I cant tell anything positive about it. So far I had rated less than five books of this category a one star as far as I remember, and this book is one of the minority."
1,Caution! Don't step here...,"First of all this IS NOT the complete series of One Step Beyond. I, too, am a child of the 50's. I collect any and all anthologies of that decade. True, there was a 12 and then an 8 DVD box set released years ago this is NOT THE ONE, not even close and they were not in chronological order nor was it the complete series. Last year, IMAGE released, The Official First Season of One Step Beyond. It's wonderful. This set, that we're discussing here was issued by Alpha and while the majority of these episodes are public domain, they are not cleaned-up copies and will leave a bad stench in the mouth. Just my 3cents."
2,Have to agree with the other raters,"I have to agree.....This set leaves alot to be desired....episodes are out of order...Picture quality is hit and miss....There are 3 more DVD'sof this series that were NOT included with this set....Volumes 13, 14 and 15....and the quality of those is similar to these.The only nice thing I can say about this set....I paid far less than the $68.00 (a hell of alot less!!!) than what they seem to be generally asking.As the other guy said.....The Official First Season is superb....So when do we see the rest?? I believe there were 97 episodes..shown over 3 seasons"
1,what a mistake,"I bought this one of course the reviews sounds good to me.I hope to found a kind of ""Twilight Zone"" series,but the most stories of ""ONE STEP BEYOND""haven'tthe class of the Twilight Zone.The quality of the DVD's are really bad!It was a mistake to buy the complete series without a screen-test before.The good thing is,it wasn't expensive & it was a fun to see some famous actor'sfirst step's on TV-screen."
1,Bad Transfer,"In spite of its impressive twelve volume Set, this is not,as other Raters mentioned, the complete collection of OneStep Beyond. The pictures and sound are very poor.Sad to say, Paramount is very slow in producing the completeseries. Lately, a definitive set was released in three DVD's.It mean we have to wait for a long time before we can havea glimpse of this classic show."
3,Leather? Medicine ball,"It is a good medicine ball but does not seem to be leather. It is some kind of material that looks like leather but feels more like plastic/vinyl. Whatever it is it should not be advertised as leather. It is sturdy and should stand up to a lot of abuse, however, once your hands begin to sweat it will become slippery."
4,Good collection..... Well worth the money!,"It's official! The Punk-O-Rama series has surpassed the ""Punk & Disorderly"" and ""Burning Ambitions"" collections if you're looking for great punk rock primers! This DVD contains a neat collection of desent videos (most of them appear to be shot at someone's backyard BBQ). Recommended to ALL fans of alternative music, punk, hardcore and skater scene. Consider it money well spent."
4,Good DVD,Good collection of old Epitaph classics (not exactly a good representation of their current lineup. You're not going to find any Ikara Colt on here). The epitaph documentary is good.Just thought I should warn you kids - the Bouncing Souls show are two songs of live footage montage dubbed by studio tracks. Kind of defeats the excitement if you ask me
3,Somewhat laughable dialogue....,Who wrote this episode? It's not hard to imagine Richard Hatch and Terry Carter grimacing with some of the dialogue they had to speak.
3,Battlestar Galactica - The Feature Film (Widescreen Edition) (1978),"The item I got was not what was ordered. I actually got the SyFy channel miniseries, but I kept it because I would probably have ordered it in the future."
3,A Comment....,"this is a rebuttal of sorts....For the record, BG was planned as a TV miniseries in 1977-78, and was shot in standard TV format, meaning full frame aspect ratio of 1.33:1. However, the show had cost more than expected, and so it was decided to release a edited version to theaters in canada and probably overseas. In order to do this, they reprinted the film with the top and bottom portions masked off to adapt to then-current movie projectors. Then, as now, practically every theater was setup to screen films in either 1.85:1 or 2.35:1. So this version is a representation of BG that was sent to theaters in 1978(As for this DVD being without anamorphic enhancement, that's just Universal being cheap and seeing a chance to exploit BG fandom by double-dipping. Although I don't know how many takers they will get because they included a promo for the SciFi Channel's ""reimagining"" Of Battlestar Galactica....something that dedicated Galactica fans HATE!!!)"
2,Has not aged well.,"When I was a kid, I loved this movie and the TV series. I was a devoted fan, and built model rockets of the Viper fighter, and dreamed of one day being a starfighter pilot. So you can imagine that I was very excited about getting this DVD. Unfortunately, now that I am an adult it simply isn't possible to enjoy it any more. The storyline is full of holes and every cliche you can think of. The special effects are cheap. It's just no fun anymore."
4,Battlestar Galactica the movie - not the pilot,"I have read many reviews of the videos and DVD regarding this movie and all are in error as thay have said that this release is the pilot episode for the series. Sadly, it is not. Nor is it a combined version of the pilot and the 4th episode. It is merely the pilot episode minus about 14 minutes(I have compared it to my old recording of the pilot) and some of the sequences are edited differently. However, it is still great in this form, Dolby Digital Mono is ok but it sounds better in Pro-Logic surround. The trailer would have been a nice bonus feature. But it wasn't apparently available, perhaps a Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS Special edition will be released with the trailer included to make us DVD collector's happy. I have heard rumors that maybe the entire series, incl. the pilot, will be released on DVD soon."
2,why is this version not anamorphic widescreen????,I love the fact they have finally re-released bsg on dvd again long time coming for us who have widescreens. However anyone hoping to get an anamorphic widescreen presentation of this film well we will have to continue to wait as they have decided not to release it in this fantastic format WHY????? Don't get me wrong I'm still very happy to own this title it's a classic but it is still a huge dissapointment. Amazon has it listed as anamorphic widescreen BEWARE it is an error unfortunetly.
3,BG Lives,I gave it three stars because it is rumored that the widescreen version is fake. The black bars are just placed there for effect and it isn't the true widescreen format. I love Galactica and can't wait for the DVDs to the series to be released for purchase. Right now however this is all we have unless they come up with a special edition DVD with interviews with the surviving cast. The best episodes were the ones with the late Lloyd Bridges as Commander Cain titled The Living Legend.
3,"Great to have Galactica on DVD, but...","There's a ton of footage that was cut and re-arranged from the original ABC TV Galactica pilot to make the theatrical version of Galactica (which is the version on the DVD). Universal would've been very wise to put the full, uncut version of the pilot on DVD, giving both die-hard and casual fans a glimpse of some footage which hasn't been seen in almost 22 years (although much of the cut footage HAS been re-instated for the frequent 3-part Sci-Fi Channel re-run of the pilot, some of it is still missing even in that version). The scenes shot for the movie should've been included, but specially marked as such. That way, anyone just dying to see Baltar's head cut off could program it in instead of the TV version of the scene, where he's spared. All the same, it's an excellent version of the theatrical Galactica, which was great fun...but there's so much that should've been on the DVD that isn't."
4,Old & outdated doesn't mean bad & worthless,"This is the 2 hour premiere movie to kick off the series. The special effects are really good for the time. The acting isn't bad and the storyline is good. All in all, if you like good sci-fi & can look at it for the time, I recomend it. It's also good for kids 4+. It's clean, meaning no nudity, no bad language(frack & felgercarb are the words used). And there is no real violence. It's visually captivating for the kids."
2,"2/8/05 DVD release NOT anamorphic, contrary to description","I feel cheated, because the only reason I ordered this new (2/8/05) DVD release of Galactica is because I thought they're finally releasing a widescreen anamorphic (instead of letterboxed) version, because the technical details section in amazon explicitly states that this is the case. WRONG! As far as I can tell, this release is no improvement over the older DVD releases. Still letterboxed and not enhanced for widescreen TV's, and not digitally remastered either. The only thing they added are ads for the mini-series and the game on side B, which I don't really care. Had I known this, I'd have just rented the older release instead. What a bummer. Don't buy this if you already have the old DVD release or can rent it."
1,A DVD release that could have been so much better,"This is the theatrical release of the pilot movie ""Saga of a Star World."" It was released in ""Sensaround"" sometime after the series premiered on television. A lot of footage was cut (perhaps 10-20 minutes worth), but a few additional shots are added such as a certain villain's execution. Universal missed an excellent opportunity to release an uncut version of the pilot movie. Instead what we get is what was already released on video with matts added for a widescreen effect--effectively cutting the top and bottom off the picture. Shame on you Universal!"
5,Holds up well,"The music, the effects, some of the acting... It was all above and beyond what had been attempted up to that point on TV (1978). It all holds up well over twenty years later, although it could be improved with a new TV or motion picture version, which I will continue to hope for. One small detail I must point out: I've seen it mentioned several times, the last occasion by a reviewer slightly lower on this page, that this movie is a combination of the TV pilot and the 5th episode of the series. In reality, the 5th episode of Galactica was ""The Long Patrol."" There is no footage from ""The Long Patrol"" in this movie, so you don't have to worry about some hatchet editing job being done. This is simply the 3-hour pilot with about 20 minutes or so of footage edited out, so that it runs slightly over 2 hours. I don't know how, why or where this 5th episode reference began, but it is not true."
2,Not the Original Longer Version,Battlestar Galactica was first seen in the USA as a three-hour premiere on a Sunday night. I watched that broadcast from 8pm to 11pm. Later this edited version was released to theatres in Sensurround. Hopefully the series boxed set will contain the complete film.
3,battlestar has come a long way,I remember watching battlestar when I was a kid and hadn't seen it for a long time...man I didn't remember it being sooo cheesy. It was fun to watch anyways. I laughed a lot - and not because it was meant to be funny...I'm just glad they re-did battlestar!!
3,Good but after the years looks a bit worn.,"Just to clarify this for those who are reading other reviews.... I was 9 when this movie (yes MOVIE) came out in theatres before they did put it on TV. In fact the TV version replaced an original plot point where Baltar, the evil humans name, was killed by the Cylons when the BG got away.So yes there was a movie first. This is not a pilot episode it was a film that they just turned into a TV series by showing the movie on TV with slight adjustments.The Film in its time was great. I loved it as a kid (Not that lame BG 1980 when they get to Earth though that was very bad....)The problem was the series was just too expensive in its day and they could not afford it for TV. That and falling ratings killed it.The movie now is a bit dated as Star Wars and the Original Star Trek look like ScFi of the era but it is still a reasonably good film/TV Shows. Just take the acting with the same grain of salt that you do the acting is Star Wars and you are ok!"
1,GARBAGE!!!,"What a load. Don't waste your time with this nonsense. It's corny, poorly acted, just plain silly, and very bush. I can't believe the glowing reviews I've read. Are these people serious??? What's with the ridiculous robotic dog and that insipid, bratty kid? 1978 or not, those DOS-like graphics on the Galactica's computers are soooooooo cheesy. Save your money, save your time, save your sanity!!!"
2,Widescreen?,Since this was produced for television and never originally intended to be a feature film how could it possibly be widescreen? Very shameful of the company to distribute this under the false pretense that it is a widescreen feature film.
3,lost in space,this video is exciting and may have been tragic if the fleet had been destroyed. This video was exciting but would have been tragic if the fleet had been destroyed. then where would the series have gone?where would the series go?
5,Still great after all these years,"I remember the first time I saw Galactica. I don't think I blinked once through the entire first hour. I was blown away, just like I was by Star Wars. I think most of this episode holds up over the years, with the possible exception of the casino scenes. The first half hour is still fantastic, there are glimpses of humor, great special effects, and plenty of action. I find it hard to believe the effects were that good 20 years ago on TV. They're better than that computer generated stuff they use on the Star Trek series, that's for sure."
4,MORE GALACTICA DVD's PLEASE,"But this one has nothing in the way of extra's. Still, If you love the show like I do, its a must have!"
3,an ensured future,"battlestar will inevitably be brought back. the thing is to stick to glen larson""s vision . richard hatch has to be included,but please as an actor only. big name actors will want to ham it up ala batman tv show, but i hope they stick to the epic implication of their journey. starship troopers took a bit of inspiration from these guys!!!!!what a dichotomy."
4,"Excellent for it's time, highly underrated by critics","One key part is missing. The scene on Caprica where Serina is broadcasting the Peace celebration and her coverage of the attack by the Cylons, also missing is the scene before this where officer Omega tells Adama about the broadcast from Caprica. This video is a shortened version of the actual summer 1978 theatrical release and not a three hour pilot. The pilot came after the theatrical run."
3,"HAHAHAHAHA! Oh, God. HAHAHAHAHAHA!","Saw this for no good reason when it came out in theatres. Series had actually been on TV already (like with Buck Rogers), but ad promoted film in 'SENSAROUND'! Ooooohhhh...Besides making the theatre vibrate, the only thing different/better about the film is Baltar gets beheaded. Which makes it hilarious when he's back the next week on the series.Good times."
2,Space Cheese,"Cheesy, soap-opera quality film meant to capitalize on the late-70's space craze is ok when there's action but really starts to drag when there's dialogue. The special effects are pretty good but the cast, with a couple of exceptions, is soap-opera quality at best. After reading that this film was pieced together from episodes of the TV series, the lack of a strong, clear narrative makes a little more sense. After a strong first half hour, it feels like this movie just sort of wanders around. It has a somewhat incoherent, pasted-together feel. But despite the film's weaknesses, there are worse ways to kill a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. If for no other reason, you should check out all the 1970's David Cassidy-style haircuts."
4,Richard Strauss's Daphne,Both Mlle. Fleming and Richard Strauss are favorites of mine. I have heard Mlle. Fleming in Rosenkavalier as well as Arabella on stage. This recording does not disappoint devotees of either the soprano or the composer. And the supporting cast -- particularly Johan Botha as Apollo -- provides glorious singing.The Cologne WDR symphony orchestra does full justice to Strauss's heavy demands.
4,Excellent,"Gorgeous vocal music performed gorgeously. As is typical for Strauss, there is a lot of demanding and beautiful writing for soprano. The orchestration is lovely as well. Perhaps without the drama or tension of his best operas but this is not a second rate work like Danae. All performances, especially that by the consistently outstanding Renee Fleming, are excellent. The Orchestra has a lovely sound. Well worth owning if you are interested in opera."
2,Not the Best Recording,"I know in recent years Renee Fleming has developed an opinion that she can pretty much sing anything well (how else do you explain her recording a Stevie Wonder song?). The problem with this is she simply can't.While much of this recording is quite good (Johan Botha is a revalation!), unfortunately, Fleming brings down the proceedings everytime she opens her mouth. It's true--her German is pretty terrible. She consistently misprounces the name of her character (what's odd about this is everyone else seems to get it right), and when she sings ""Ich komme"" in the Transformation Scene, it comes out sounding like ""Ash Canna."" Perhaps Fleming needs to stick with the French and Italian roles that made her a star and leave the German roles to the experts."
3,Enter Mama Raccoon,"I've owned this feeder for 7 months and LOVED it. Easy to fill and clean. All sizes of birds were able to enjoy the seed mixture it held - finches, nuthatches, woodpeckers, cardinals and blue jays. I was thrilled. I did notice the slight tipping problem another reviewer mentioned, but it was not a problem until a few weeks ago when Mama Raccoon discovered this feeder. She has managed to get past a raccoon baffle and a flat squirrel baffle and then all she has to do is reach out and tip this feeder to completely empty it. The seeds fall easily to the ground to the delight of her waiting children. If she couldn't get past the baffles, all she would have to do is shake the pole and the seed would fall out. There are 3 other feeders on my pole - this particular feeder is the only one she can get seed out of. If the manufacturer can redesign the hanging mechanism then this would be a 5 star feeder, indeed!"
3,OK but several problems,"The unit comes a part to easily, great for cleaning but the animals seem to knock it apart occassionally. When it rains the seed in the tray area gets wet and must be cleaned out or the seed doesn't come out easily."
5,"very sturdy, much better quality than home depot ones","those in home depot are made with super thin aluminum sheets, and they are so flimsy that if youwave them in the air, they flap around and make sound from the warping of the metal.This one is made with aluminum sheet of about 0.7-0.8 mm, very strong, no flexing. The seal betweenthe base plate and the duct is also very tight. Compared to this, the home depot ones have large chasms between the fits, and they had to put a lot of rubber caulking over the seams! imagine over time that the caulking would give out, and water would get in."
2,Dissapointed,"Broan used to be about quality, not so much anymore. The seals on both sides of the flap were way off! keeping the flap open about 3/4 of an inch. If you don't mind cold air blowing in or bugs getting through then it's worth it"
1,Same Old Advice,I did not like this book because the exercises were notshown in detail enough for you to easily do them.The advice and exercises were really the same thing youcould put together yourself after looking through somemagazine articles. Not much new or helpful here. I wasexpecting help in strengh training and there is just notenough here.
1,To many words not enough subsence,This book did not have clear guide lines. All could have been said in a few words. Would not recommed this book.
2,Very little substance - very disappointing,"After hearing an interview of the author and the research study, I was interested in the book. Most of what was written could have been consolidated into a much smaller book. It made good points, but had very little substance and seemed to be written for a 5th grade reading level. If someone is new to the concept of fitness, health and aging, it might be a good starter. Otherwise, skip the book, but keep staying fit mentally and physically"
2,Strong Women Stay Young,"Received wrong book. However, credit and an apology were both issued in a timely manner."
5,Every woman over 40 should read this book.,"A well written, very motivational book which encourages women to take control of their health and physical fitness, with detailed directions on how to do just that. I wish I had found this book years ago, but it is never too late to begin taking care of oneself. I recommend it highly."
4,Sedentary lifestyle --,"I recently purchased this book in hopes it would help me withmy deconditioned muscles, due to years of chronic hip and back pain and a very sedentary life. I'm more than willing to give this a try,as it sounds like an exercise program that one can stick to and it's not too intensive for someone who isn't very physically fit. I would be interested in hearing from otherwomen (age 50+) who also have some limitations on the amount ofexercise they can begin with and how their bodies reacted to this program of weight lifting and what kind of results they had..."
5,"Exciting, Practical, and Motivating!","I am recommending this book to all the adult women in my life. It contains a hype-free, do-able program, along with lots of encouragement, user-friendly advice, interesting medical/fitness info, and the results of scientific research into how this program has transformed the lives of ordinary women. I am a 40 year old certified fitness instructor, and I'm constantly encouraging my clients to get their hands on this book. This is one book most women should have in their library. The info contained therein will help you to really understand and get excited about what strength training can do for you, which can help motivate you to take the first steps, (or to hang in there if you've already begun) to a stronger, healthier, more energized you."
5,You will see results,"This book was recommended to me by a 40-something doctor with whom I work. I noticed her arms were more 'cut' and that her clothes were fitting better, and I asked her what she was doing. She told me about Strong Women Stay Young and I ordered it.I read through the book and loved it. It's based on science, not some new fad, and it's easy for the lay person to understand. The exercises are simple and easy to do. You can do them anywhere anytime. I noticed results in my upper and lower legs and my upper arms within one month. It's easy to see that this regimen can be used for a lifetime. I didn't lose any weight, but I appear slimmer and I feel better and stronger. My balance is better, too. I highly recommend this book and I have no intention of reselling mine. I've urged several friends to buy it."
2,OK For Beginners With Strong Wrists,"I bought this and gave it away to a friend who's never exercised. Good basic stuff, but nothing new for anyone who already has an exercise program. A FATAL FLAW: the authors never address the wrist issue and suggest exercises that, in my experience, will hurt wrists if they are already weak or threatening carpal tunnel. Since this is a very common problem with women over 40, I feel that it should be addressed. Some of the illustrations actually show women using weights in a way that might exacerbate wrist damage. I struggle with the problem daily and my trainer won't let me near upper body weights--not even 5 pound weights--unless I have my wrist reinforcers on. Such precautions are not given in this book."
5,This Really Works,"Nelson's book is very accessible. The weight lifting routines are easy to follow,and they do work. They have helped me to become much trimmer and stronger,and I can really feel it when I'm walking or bike riding. The chapters on bone densityand osteoporosis are informative and will definitely motivate a person to startthe program. I've read a lot of exercise and diet books over the years, and this isdefinitely the most useful and reliable."
3,Not slow enough.,This DVD is good but the songs are played through way too fast and the tablature that comes with it is different from what they teach you in the DVD. It's kind of frustrating because you will learn something off of the tablature at your own pace and think to yourself that it doesn't sound quite right. Then when you play the DVD you realize that it sounds like that because it isn't right. You end up having to rewind the DVD and play it back to yourself over and over and it's difficult to fidget with the DVD remote controll and play your guitar at the same time or go back and forth. You'll suddenly need to drop the remote to play guitar and then be able to grab the remote and hit pause and rewind at the drop of a hat too.
3,Not the best Mississippi John Hurt Lesson DVD,"The only thing you really learn from this DVD is how to read tablature. Happy Traum and John Sebastian are excellent fingerpickers and give you some very helpful pointers on how to play the songs of Mississippi John Hurt, but that is about it. The versions they teach are close to what Mississippi John Hurt played, but not the exact versions. This DVD would be good for someone who already knows how to play these songs and need some more tips and tricks to further their skills. If you want a more note for note lesson, John Miller's Mississippi John Hurt DVDs are a better place to start."
1,Clear Color Magna Tiles,"This was our 6 year old granddaughter's favorite Christmas present. Along with the solid color Magna-tiles, she has spent many hours ""building"" castles and whatever her imagination produced."
5,Great Long Lasting Toy,I bought this for my five year old nephew after seeing my friend's son play with these year after year. This is a toy that can stay in the toy rotation for a long time with kids losing interest. They are little expensive and I would have like to have been able to afford the larger set. But ultimately I think you get your money's worth since kids can stay interested in them for many years.
5,Best toy!,This is the best toy I have bought in a long time. My son plays win it everyday. I am surprised everyday when he finds a new way to play with them.
2,Not as good as Magformers,"We got these because my son's preschool teacher recommended them, but then someone else bought him Magformers, which are waaay better. These tend to fall apart more easily and the big problem with them is hard to explain, but here goes: they are straight-edged with 90-degree corners, which (with the tendency to fall apart) makes it difficult to build more complex shapes, like regular polyhedrons. The other day, my son and I made a regular icosohedron out of magformers and it even withstood a little tossing around, and that would never happen with these. Because of the shape, they fit together best at right angles to each other. I would skip these and get magformers instead."
5,Fantastic building toy,"Durable, wonderfully educational and easy to use building toy. We debated a bit on purchasing as the price for this set is a bit high, but so far we have found it to be worthwhile. I am continually amazed at the complex structures my 3 year old is able to build with this set, which I attribute to well thought-out design of the pieces and the way the magnets work together. He loves making all kinds of 2D shapes, prompting lots of questions about what shape he's made. When he builds 3D structures, the pieces stay together fairly well but are still satisfyingly easy to knock down. My son's caretaker highly recommended this toy because he had enjoyed playing with it with her children. She purchased several sets 3 years ago and has had no problems yet with broken pieces or loss of magnetism."
1,WAY OVER PRICED,Don't pay this much money. I found them for $47 These are wonderful if you find them around $50 I used them in my preschool class and they were a hit. 32 is not enough for a few kids though. Maybe one child only
1,TOO EXPENSIVE,"Don't buy this toy from ""Steal of A Deal"" this is a highway robbery. the toys will be available in the next few days also make sure to remember there name and stop buying from them in the future"
5,Great !!!!!!,Great item my 5 yr old loves them he builds all sorts of things I would reccomendf them to everyone.
4,A very good and creative toy,My grandson age 6 enjoyed it. He is very interested in building and how things fit together so it is a good toy for him
5,Mimi of 5,"This is the greatest toy! It encourages children to be creative, because they can build many different things with these blocks. They stick together on all sides, so the possibilities are almost endless. I got a set of these for my grandson last year. My daughter-in-law took them to church where she is the Children's Director. The children at church liked them so much that they had to get a set for the church as well. I love to get ""open ended"" toys for children because they are not ""locked-in"" to using them in only one or two ways. They can use their imaginations which is very beneficial to their overall development."
5,Great toy,A great toy that is very unique. Our little one played with a set while visiting some friends and so Santa brought these for her.
4,does its job,what can you say about this thing. Its a centering device and torque arrestor for a well pump. It arrived on time...seems heavy duty enough...Its all good
2,Beethoven's 5th Review,"Beethoven's 5th was a disappointment. Like so many sequals, Beethoven movies should have stopped after the first two! The first one was excellent, the second was good and the last three were just ho-hum. I would suggest renting the movie before decided to purchase it."
1,Something is missing,"This book was recommended to me by a fan of Haack. I checked the online bibliography and found that although Frederick OlafsonNaturalism and the Human Condition: Against Scientismhad published his thorough critique of scientism two years before Haack's book, she seems somehow to have been unaware of it. I consider that a significant enough omission to justify my 1 star review."
1,Very Difficult Product,"I bought this product hoping to do some designs for wood working projects. We use AutoCAD in the office but that is way to much for my home use and very expensive. I thought since that is supposed to be such a great product that I would buy from the same manufacture. BAD IDEA. I bought this a year ago and it took me forever to learn it. Like another reviewer said IT DOESN""T WORK LIKE ANY OTHER CAD TOOL ON THE MARKET. Pay attention to that. This is a very hard tool to learn. I've finally learned it, but working with the tool is not easy at all. I have since trashed it and bought TurboCAD Deluxe v9.2. Much easier to use. More documentation and actually cheaper. They have a demo you can download at their site that was very helpful in my decision."
2,Not Worth The Price,This is one of the first items I was really disappointed with. I expected a lot more for the price.
2,Another clipped interview with Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen...among a bunch of lowlifes!,"But tape but Rick Nielsen is his usualfunny self. Long live Chaep Trick! RN,BEC, RZ and Jon Brant!"
2,Worked great but a lot were broken,"I couldn't find clay targets anywhere so I looked online and found them here. The targets were exactly what I was looking for but I expected to get a lot of broken clays as I had read in other reviews. Sure enough I did. I only received about 40 of the 90 clays intact. I was able to salvage about 5 others that had simple breaks that I could glue back together with ease. Still, the shipping costs greatly decreased the value of the clays and then only half the clays surviving transport made the value even worse. I will still search out clay targets but I will not have them (at least this brand) shipped to me again."
4,clay can be used for many things,"Shooting these clay pigeons would help simulate shootoing at game birds. You can put various twists in the release of the clay pigeons. This ability, once mastered, will definately make you a better game shooter."
5,High fantasy at its best,I am still surprised by the complexity and richness of this series. My only regret is that there are only 10 books of this magnificent story
5,Fantasy doesn't get more epic than this,"This was a facinating and challenging read. If you're interested in reading House of Chains then I can only assume you've already read the first three books in the series (if not, turn back now and read those, don't attempt this without their background). This is the best book but most challenging book in the series yet. The book requires that recall quite a bit from the first three books and that you pay very close attention without getting bogged down in the scale of the book.For me, House of Chains was worth the effort, it made me want to dismiss my other reading plans and read the entire series back to back. I felt some of the weaknesses of Erickson's writing in the earlier books had been cleaned up. Each time I picked up the book and read even a page I was quickly immersed in his amazing word."
3,excellent book but kindle version flawed,"I cannot overstate how much I love this series. I always recommend it. The characters and depth of creativity in the world building have enchanted me from the first book. I love Mr. Erickson's writing. I picked up the kindle versions of the books for my second read-through. There seems to have been no editing whatsoever in formatting it for the kindle. An editor would have noticed the predominance of capital ""T""s that replace other letters throughout the book. Or the changing of names. For example, the character Silgar was 60 percent of the time called Sugar, and Toc was Toe. Having to guess at what words are or who they are talking about really takes away from the enjoyment.Again, read this series. I highly recommend it. But get the paper version."
3,"Ah, well... the least in a great series","I'm a fan of this series, but this volume is the weakest so far. The humor is nearly absent, and where it exists, falls flat, but my biggest problem with this book is the lack of truely likeable charactors. By the end of the story Karsa becomes an interesting, tho, still unlikeable charactor, and there are some devolopments for others. The whole feeling is murky and ambigious. There's no decernable heroes or villains here. Fiddler is back, but he seemed rather lost in enui. It just came off feeling kinda dry. I plowed thru the first three books in a couple days each and this one took me a couple of weeks to work my way to the end."
4,Too much work but still good.,"The Malazan books are too complex and I get lost. Even though I'm on the 4th book I don't really know what's going on. I gave the book 4 stars because the writing is great and I enjoyed the experience of reading it. There were some scenes in this book and previous books that were so moving that while the storyline is lost in a fog, the emotional impact sticks with me.If you are a casual reader, you may want to skip this series altogether. If you don't mind investing some time (and a little research) this series is worth your while.I'm more of a casual reader to I don't know when I'll break down and stuggle through the 5th book in the series."
5,Awesome Book,"This is the 4th book in the Malazan series. This is the book that introduced one of my favorite characters in the Malazan series, Karsa Orlong. He makes a grand entrance and does not let up. Any fan of Erikson will love this book."
4,Excellent in part,"What I liked about this book was the part dealing exclusively with Karsa. I got as strong a sense of wonder as in fiction like Conan, Death Dealer or The Chosen (The Stone Dance of the Chameleon). If you're estrogen heavy then I don't suppose you'd like it much, otherwise it's a must read.The rest of the book is tedious."
4,Fascinating but with a few flaws,"4+ only this time.It took me a while to get into the book. Not that it was difficult but it started with a new character, I disliked, and his people history that continued for quite a while.Another drawback, I concede it might be my low IQ but..., was an enormous number of the warrens with difficult and confusing spelling. I confess, I was lost in it.Otherwise, the story line, besides the first 100 pages or so introducing us to arrogant Karsa and his lot, was very interesting and it was fun and pleasurable reading. Unfortunately, I lost someone is this book I initially disliked but eventually grew fond of. Sad.I am looking forward to reading the next instalment in the saga."
4,Book Four,"Book four of this series is one of my least favorite. The first hundred pages drove me nuts because it was a side plot (that turns into a main plot line) and I wanted to read about the story line that I was expecting. That being said it actually adds a lot to the story. This book moves the overall storyline along well but it just didn't measure up to the other books. However, while it fell short of some of the other Malazan books of the fallen, it was still outstanding compared with what other authors are putting out. Another positive note is that unlike my other favorite author (GRRM) Erikson is very consistent in his book output of about one a year. I'm not sure why I'm even writing a review to this book because if you've read to book four, you know you're not going to stop."
4,good styling info,I recently got this. I have a few instructional cds and dvds for harmonica. This one is very good showing phrasing and style with a few riffs. I enjoy it and re-watch different sections to learn more completely. I am glad I have it and would recommend it.
3,ET the way it used to be,"New Years Eve Live1979 brings back a lot of ET memories. While not as historically significant as the 1965 live show recording (featuring that great '60s Texas Troubadors band), this CD is entertaining enough. Reminds me of the Tubb performances I saw in 1971 (opening for Merle Haggard) and in 1976 (anchoring a package show that included Crystal Gayle and Rex Allen Jr.) After all those years, he could still pull off the 1940s hits with style. The long-time loyal fans (who knew every lyric and every guitar lick) loved it. This 1979 recording has a full sounding band and a folksiness not heard since the days when ET himself hosted the Midnight Jamboree. There are probably better Tubb collections to be had, but for those who never saw him or would like to rekindle the memories, this CD is a lot of fun. What the heck, bump it up to 4 stars! Let's walk that floor one more time, boys."
2,Past his prime,"ET had really slipped vocally by this time. While any live performance by him is worth a listen, this one is pretty disappointing. Get the 1965 live show perfomance instead."
5,No complaints,Memory is one those things that seems to work or not. So far it works so I'm happy. It was delivered on time and it hasn't burned my house down so I'm grateful.
5,Crucial RAM for my HP Pavilion a530n PC,"I bought this RAM upgrade my HP Pavilion a530n desktop PC. Although the HP website said I should use the 512MB RAM for my PC, I checked the Crucial website which said I could use the 1GB RAM. So I bought it and it works great with my PC."
4,Worth the price,Well the reason to buy this was to speed up my PC - which it did - so no complains here.
5,Nothing but Crucial,I never buy RAM other than Crucial. These sticks lasted the life of the computer without a single cause for alarm. Highly recommended.
5,Crucial Tech RAM Stick,This is very awesome! I have never had so much ram on my computer before.Thank you very much for making it possible...
1,Be Warned,Nothing in the description indicates this is high density memory and will not work in 90% of the older computers out there that need low density memory.I used the configurator at Crucial and it correctly told me the type of memory I needed but it cost twice as much as the memory here. Thinking that Crucial was trying to rip me off I bought the memory listed on this page only to find it did not work. Turns out Crucial was trying to steer me straight not rip me off. Don't make the same mistake I did and think just because it says 1GB 184-Pin PC2700 333Mhz DIMM DDR RAM that is all you need to know to match it correctly to your PC.
5,"Easy Install, works great","This is my first RAM I ever installed but I didn't have any problem installing it, all you need is to find out the right RAM that goes for your computer and install it, its like inserting a CD in your CD player. It works great and my computer is much more faster than it was. The primary reason of mine behind installing more RAM was that I installed the Photoshop CS3 in my computer, which made my computer very slow. In order to work with Photoshop better I installed more RAM, which worked perfectly. Now I use it without any trouble and is fast enough for me as a digital photography student. This product worked great for me."
4,Great product!,"My computer was dying a slow death in terms of speed. I installed the Crucial Technology RAM and poof! My computer actually moved through Internet pages quickly. I still hit glitches when I'm in my Yahoo! email account, but I don't fault the company for that, I fault Yahoo!'s stupid ads and graphics for the reduction in speed. So far I am very happy with my new product and I hope to get plenty of use from it before I build a brand new system altogether."
4,Worked great in a Dell computer,"Upgraded the memory in the daughters old Dell computer. It plugged right in. The hardest thing was figuring out how to open the case. The computer booted right up with no problems, and is much faster with the new memory. There are several types of memory in Dell computers depending on the model. Make sure your computer requires PC2700 333Mhz or the voltages might be wrong."
4,Crucial RAM,"Crucial Technology CT12864Z335 1GB 184-Pin PC2700 333Mhz DIMM DDR RAM MemoryAs noted above, takes some pressure to install. PC now more responsive but not dramatically so. Certainly cheaper than new computer."
1,Crucial Technology CT12864Z335 1GB 184-Pin PC2700 333Mhz DIMM DDR RAM Memory,"It did not work at all in my computer. Before purchasing this memopry, I ran the Crucial memory test and it said this was the correct memory. I have to return it!"
5,Exactly what I needed,"Popped this memory stick right into my older Dell Inspiron, and it worked like a charm. Really sped up the system, and did exactly what I needed."
5,"Good Ram, but check seller reviews","I always order Crucial ram when I want to upgrade a computer. Putting a couple sticks of this in an old dell did WONDERS, buying more RAM is always a good investment. The memory I received this time was not in it's original manufacturer packaging, and may have been used. I believe that this is the fault of the seller, so buyer beware and check amazon seller reviews if not ordering from Amazon."
