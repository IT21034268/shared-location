1,Crap,I expected more from this microphone after reading the reviews. After-all this is only a mic; there is no headset which might make it worth the purchase. The mic boom is flimsy and can not even stay in position without scotch tape. I could not test the mute feature since the amazon dealer did not send that part. And as for the mic quality I could careless because it is unwearable. This makes the product useless for me. I hope others have a better experience.
2,Check your facts please,"I was excited to buy this book and was fascinated by most of the early historical perspective.Most endurance riders will recognize the 2003 Haggin and Tevis Cup horse, Split, is Master Motion. Red is Crystals Charm, NOT ""Major Motion"". ""Major Motion"" does not exist.These facts are so easy to verify just by checking the AERC records (or just ask any endurance rider), there is no reason for these errors. Just ruined the whole book for me because the veracity of the rest of the book is suspect."
5,an over-all wonderful CD,"the lyrics, melodies, strong voice--everything comes together beautifully. Most of the attention on the CD has been given to ""I'll Be,"" and justly so; however, ""I've got to stop thinking 'bout that"" is definitely a song that sticks with you! This CD stays in my frequently-played rotation!"
5,"Good Lyrics, and a Great Band","I bought this CD for ""I'll Be"" but found that I really enjoyed the rest of it as well. While they don't have the power of Paul Simon or the fame of REM, I think there week points make this CD shine. They remind me of the many really good local bands that few people ever hear. There lyrics grow on you and there sound is cleaver without being to harsh or hockey. I highly recommend this CD and look forward to where they go from here."
3,A CD to get Sick of.,"I have had this CD for a couple years and I liked it for a while. It took me a few months to get bored of it, but while I liked it, it was good. Edwin's style is a bit like that of Dave Matthews except more bluesy. This CD is not for everyone, but if you listen to one of his samples and like the sound, you will enjoy it. It's sort of a ""like one, like them all"" sort of thing."
3,They're trying too hard.,"Edwin McCain has an awesome voice. ""I'll Be"" is wonderful - that's why I bought the CD. However, the rest of the CD doesn't live up to ""I'll Be"". It sounds like they are trying too hard to have deep, meaningful lyrics. I wish I'd just bought the single."
3,Hydrogen Peroxide,The book was very informative. Alot of info on what has been done to date. I was looking for more info concerning the oral usage of hydrogen peroxide. This book didn't cover much in that respect.
4,Straight-forward Informative Talk,"The medical miracle of H202 is a good straightforward book with information and examples of the medical uses of H202. The good news is William Campbell Douglass is an MD. He shows the uses and misuses of the application of hydrogen peroxide. This is not written like promotional information for the product, which is a good thing. It is simple, dry and humorous at times, which is good for this type of book with health industry jargon. The only bad news is that it would of been nice to see more examples of how the everyday person could find safe uses for the product in there own home, since most of us are not medical practitioners. Don't get me wrong, there are a few good examples of practical uses (including using it as a mouth-wash, toothpaste or to snort as a sinus cleanser), but if you think he is going to recommend using it orally, he won't. Overall, good book, I learnt what I was looking for in obtaining this book, thus I consider it a worthy purchase."
5,Peroxide?,This book is great reading. If you are considering using Food Grade Peroxide this book is a must read.
4,Satisfied,I ordered this book for a friend who saw an ad in a magazine.She truly enjoys reading this book and learning from it.Thank you seller for prompt service and the book was in greatshape.
1,A dangerous book.,"A dangerous book.Harmful because it encourages people to use hydrogn peroxide during cancer treatment. Anyone who has some knowledge about this, know that supply the body with oxygen, can lead to the spread of cancer.And scientific studies show that hydrogen peroxide can not cure cancer."
1,Abject nonsense on a stick,"Seriously. This book is fantasy from beginning to end. Don't waste your money.On the plus side, the cover looks like a pair of comedy breasts."
1,Don't Be A Sucker,"The author has only one goal in writing this book, and that is to separate you from your money.If you're one to jump on the band wagon of every new diet fad, super lotion, magic potion or miracle cure du jour, this book and a good colon cleanse is right up your alley.Caveat emptor..."
2,I Use Hydrogen Peroxide but was Disappointed in the Book,"This is the first time a have felt compelled to write a review of a book because of being disappointed in my purchase. I have used 3% hydrogen peroxide for cleaning wounds all my life, and have also recently started to use it as a daily oral mouth wash with great success. I wanted to learn more about the possibility of using hydrogen peroxide orally to treat various health issues. My first feeling about the book was that it is overpriced at $18. Perhaps if I spent $10 or less for the book I would not have felt as ""ripped-off"". The book could have been much better organized. I did not find many of the numerous case histories provided very informative. I was surprised that there was not very much information about using hydrogen peroxide orally, mostly through IV. Overall, I felt that the book was not worth the money. It is a book I will try to sell to a used book store as a bad purchase. I plan on checking out another book on the subject."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"You can Google ""oral hydrogen peroxide therapy"" for more, and better, information than is in this little book. The author wants you to find a doctor who'll give you the stuff IV!"
5,Amazing information,"I ordered this book, because it has amazing truth outside the medical fields standard and sometimes uneffective protocol. Great book for those looking for alternitive truths."
1,Hydrogen Peroxide: Medical Miracle,"There is probably not too much wrong with this book, Hydrogen Peroxide: Medical Miracle, but it is at least 10 years old so much of the material is outdated, and in some instances regarding oral consumption of Hydrogen Peroxide it is contrary to the present direction that the industry is taking. A recent book I read states that only Food Grade H2O2 should be used whereas this book gives advice that 3% can be used orally. If you have a more recent publication, I would like to be advised."
2,Hydrogen Peroxide Medical Miracle,I am going to read again to be fair but I believe the author a trained doctor is medically impaired from seeing the full truth.He should read Ed McCabes two books: Oxygen Theripy and Flood Your Body With Oxygen which I am reading for the sixth time.I have seen & heard of Miracles of healing everything even the brain!
2,Medical opportunism at its worst,"The Dr. Phil of the medical internet, Dr. Douglass assembles a body of information about the history, physical properties and medicinal uses of Hydrogen Peroxide, the 21st century ""medical miracle"" substance. If you want to save 20 bucks and read a more simplified version without all the anecdotes and cute humor, then look up ""hydrogen peroxide"" on Wikipedia and tell this shameless huckster to bug off."
5,Waterer Rocks,Does its job and works in conjunction with its bottom part.My chicks still somehow crap in it so you probably need to clean it and refill it about every 2 days.
5,All You Need to Know about Tag Team Wrestling!,"The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams is one of the best books about wrestling I have ever read. The book is a comprehensive look at a part of wrestling that is starting to be overlooked. The authors rank their top 20 tag teams of all time and then takes a look at some of the most influential teams in the sport. If you like tag team wrestling, this is the book to buy!!"
4,Silent Education,"This was the textbook used for the second section of American Sign Language that I took.The video did a wonderful job of making this visual language come to life and to make the signs more, ""real"" for me as a student.Having a deaf Professor and using this book that did not write an ""English translation"" next to the vocabulary words created a total immersion into ASL as a language.There were some problems caused by this, in that after having a very vocabulary intensive section 1, this was difficult to adapt to.If a professor requires this text, and teaches well, it is very useful. If someone is trying to learn to sign on their own, outside of a college setting, I would advise against purchasing this, as it will cause a lot of confussion.This is something that needs to be supervised, and therefore, this would be a totally useless book for someone who was not enrolled in a course that coresponded to the lessons in the book."
5,This book and video tape is very helpful,This ASL book and video tape is very helpful to those trying to learn ASL. I have found the tape is at a good pace and is not too fast. I have also enjoyed having the tape in order to review what we did in class. I think you should put the vocabulary names of the pitcure a long with the sign. I recomend this book for those learning ASL.
1,Did not come with video,"I order this book and video for my up coming class. The book arrived in the wonderful condition as it said, however it was in without the video. The book is useless without the video. I contacted them and they apologized but did not answer my question of why it was not enclosed. I have returned it for a full refund, minus the shipping back. I have to check to see if I have my refund yet. I would not order from them again due to the lack of communication."
4,Informative book,The book is informative and yet has wealth of details of GMDSS.I recommend it for the people who are interested to GMDSS andIMO regulations.
1,"Ew,how boring","This book is really boring,it makes the Internet sound boring.It mentions Amazon.com but other than that it just mentions dull stuff.It's a real yawn."
5,Must have for fans,LOVE Edwin McCain. I have been going to his concerts since he was a no name and love him just as much now as I did back then. He is a wonderful person on and off stage.
5,A Southern Rock Classic,"I recently repurchased this CD after losing my original several years ago. Though the production value isn't what I really remember, the music itself has easily stood the test of time. By far, this remains Edwin McCain's best CD, even though his bigger hits came later.The jazz influence stands out here more than on later recordings, and it's really too bad he didn't keep that element. There's also a playful element that fits perfectly with the attitude he shows on stage.If you're an Edwin fan that hasn't listened to this disc yet, it's an absolute must-have."
5,Great product!,Product is great. These are very good hooks for catching fish. My husband loves them. They are hard to find.
5,"Thank you, Dr. Toy!!!","As a Toy Industry veteran with more than 30 years of experience in sales, marketing, product Development and general management, I enjoyed reading Smart Play/Smart Toys very much. I particularly appreciate the vast array of knowledge, information, and love for toys that Dr. Toy shares with her readers. This book is a great guide for parents to use when considering purchasing toys for their children, and best of all it reminds us that we're all kids at heart that never really outgrow the joy of playing with toys. It's a great read for anyone that remembers how much they enjoyed playing with their own toys while they were growing up, or anyone that is about to buy toys for the children they love in their life. Thank you, Dr. Toy!!!"
4,"Good, but too much British perspective","This book will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Buddy Holly, but from the perspective of Britain. Philip Norman seems astonished by things that are commonplace to Americans. It is not a big deal to drive a hundred miles, spend a couple of hours, and drive back. High school yearbooks are not a big deal. Eddie Cochran was not a big star in the USA; Dion was a big star. Little things like this can add up fast. I recommend this book, but not unreservedly."
5,music teacher and fan,"I'm not such a fan of Buddy Holly that I think he was the father, or King, or founder of Rock n Roll, but his music and business practices were certainly innovative for the time. (I wonder how his life and career would have developed had he lived) That said, I definitely recommend this book. It was very descriptive and entertaining to read. This book should have been the source material for the bio-pic that was made several years back! It's hard to imagine how frantic his life must have been during the last two years of his life, and as I got closer and closer to the last page--knowing how it's going to turn out--I found myself reading faster and faster, wishing this story had a different ending."
1,piece'o'junk,"I've had this paper shredder for about 3 years, used it less then 20 times. For the first time when I really needed to use it to shred old bank statements(no more then 4 or 5 sheets at a time), the thing started sounding like a broken down jet engine, and on top of that, no longer is shredding at all. We tried doing paper shredder surgery, got out the pieces of paper that seemed stuck. All paper shredders get jammed now and then, right? So no big deal. But even after clearing it out, it still sounds like a jet engine and still isn't shredding.I hate chucking things in the garbage especially such a hunk of plastic like this, but it appears to be dead forever."
1,Loud and Poorly Made,"I bought this shredder at Target a while ago. At first it worked fine for a few months. But it is too loud! If you are shredding and talking to someone in the same room you will have to yell to be heard. Then a few months later, some of the segments which do the shredding broke and the machine was literally shredding itself! Don't waste your money or hearing on this crap. I still need a shredder, but won't be buying a Royal one again."
1,Flimsy,"One paper jam broke two plastic segments of the cutting mechanism, rendering it useless. It did last a couple of years of light use (more like 2 sheets at a time than 8 at a time). Since I'm in the market for a new shredder, I'll take the opportunity to rate this one as a waste of money, and worse: something that will last forever in the landfill."
5,shredder,This is a great shredder. It handles easily 5 sheets at a time and you don't have to remove staples. It will also shred credit cards. I would definitely recommend.
1,Keep looking,"We bought two of these (on sale) and they both have had nothing but problems. Both of them within a month of using it started staying on all the time. As soon as you feed paper through it, it won't shut off. If you feed a credit card through or more than one sheet of paper, it just leaves teeth marks in it but doesn't shred it. The one my mother inlaw is using jammed and now sounds like a lawn mower. She is digging out one she has had for 10 years to replace the one we bought less than a year ago. If you one sheet of paper every six months then it might be a good deal but beside that I would keep looking."
1,ninety-nine cents seems like too steep price for those.,"I don't think anyone would buy this for original price of thirteen dollars. It is so flimsy, made out of gauze, completely see-through, it does not say what is fiber content, not all of the cut edges were serged (overlocked). I will probably selvage the zipper from the pillowcase, and use the rest as rugs."
2,Jennifer Sky's love scene,"This is for the special edition r2 pal. What you all realy want to know is about her nude scene. The multi angle mode durring the ""interactive"" view is the only way to see the entire scene. However unlike other movies that show the alternate angles ""full screen"", it is shown in a small screen to the left of the preview thumbnails. Zoom was disabled on my machine too so that is not an option either. They would have done better to just shoot a complete ""B"" movie type sex scene. Not impressed. Waste of time. Don't know if the ntsc version is any different. It is too bad I had to buy it to find out. People! the plot synopsis is a useless review. We need ""extensive"" info on the dvd it's self. Extra's ect."
2,Little to eye.,"Decent atmosphere can't mask the improbabilities of MY LITTLE EYE. This flick starts out decent enough, with some decently creepy visual flair and a commited young cast, but methodically transcends into the usual schlock that produces neither scares nor deep thought. Some good ideas are put to bad use due to the filmmakers decision to try and twist the plot a few times near the ending which just makes the viewer wonder, ""okay, what's the point?"" One of said twists really stretches the boundaries of the parameters of the plot itself, making the film kind of implode on itself in the end. There is some talent at work here, for MY LITTLE EYE is not a bad horror movie, nor is it really that good, but with some tweaking of the key elements it could've been a great little independent film."
2,Boring after all,"Well it's like big brother but with actors and (not good actors actually) The twist is really twisted making this ""movie"" looking like a joke. Nothing exciting and nothing terrific. Is it scarry ? I guess the trailer is actually scarrier than the movie itself. Is it worth your curiosity ? I've been curious about it and I haven't found yet why ! You will have more fun watching Big Brother."
1,One star is too many,"This may very well be the worse movie I've seen in a while. The plot, typical horror movie style, kinda interesting. The acting, not oscar worthy but not completely awful... What was missing was a good script... The character development was non existant. In the in I didn't care if anyone died, I just wanted the movie to be over. The only character that had any substance was a jerk and therefore you didn't like him. I actually found myself rooting for the guy because he was the only one real. Now I won't go into the unusal film shots, cutting back in forth, the night shots. I found those annoying but I understand the 'art' behind them. But the screen writer for this needs to go back to Scriptwriting 101 and reread the section on character development.... I love horror movies, this one is not horrifying in anyway shape or form. Except maybe the writing."
2,Predictable and not so compelling,"Basic flick about a bunch of 20-somethings who agree to participate in a reality-internet show with the goal to stay in a house for 6 months and win a prize. Not surprisingly, the seeming innocuousness turns to sadistic/voyeuristic side of human nature quickly. All in all, the movie is at best average. The concept isn't all that creative, and the production values are subpar (but this is partly due to the footage that is supposed to be from webcams). The acting is ok though, and the character development is surprisingly decent. I just didn't find the story to be particularly compelling or interest-maintaining."
1,Did I watch a different movie?,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's dull and not in the least bit frightening. There are plot holes you could drive a bus through. Often it simply doesn't make sense. The characters are so similar they are interchangeable (male and female!). The director seems to believe that it works better without music (it doesn't) and then tries to spice up the boring deaths and sex with truly dreadful noise. Worst of all is the script, which is cliched and laboured. The only reason I reviewed this is so that no-one else will be , like I was, misled by the glowing reviews and tempted to rent or even but it. Don't."
1,My little interest,"It's hard to be 'scared' by a film where you actually want the characters to die in the most barbaric, tortuous way. They are seriously the most stereotypical and stupidest characters ever to be seen in a 'horror' film. I think you can achieve many limitless effects and fear tactics from a voyeur/pseudo-reality related scenario. However, the director's desperate attempt to evoke the overwhelming sense claustrophia/paranoia fails due a weak, longwinded plot and unintelligent characters. It film is too formulated and dull. The ending is rushed compared to the slow pace of the rest of the film. It is also unbelievable and predictable. I guess they assumed that if you chuck some boring hollywood teens in it and make them run around clueless and panicky it becomes a big seller. It'd be scary if you were a 16 year old Big Brother fan. See 'The Blair Witch Project' or 'Series 7' instead if you're in this whole 'reality/horror' rubbish."
3,...it was...okay,"not very entralling...not very suspensful...very predictable...but not terrible... i myself wouldnt watch it again, but if your half drunk and half asleep already i suppose you wouldnt mind at how lame the story line is."
3,dull with few twists,"The idea is ok and the film builds very nicely. Unfortunately, I was expecting some dramatic twists at the end, but there is little of this, with a huge anti climax as the ending. Very very dull and with voyeuristic, pointless sex scenes and a poor budget, by the look of things. You can also see one of the character's eyes move (once their head is cut off), poor editing there. It kept my attention throughout, but I felt disapponted at the end."
4,Solid sounding good flavored coffee for your ears.,"This album delivers clear evidence of hot Latin blood. The production portrays powerful percussions, metal arrangements, electric guitars and an eminent acoustic sound that results in a complete, delightful work. Café Quijano will provide your listening palate with a fresh, warm flavor that will leave you wanting more."
4,Good Read,"Another star for Kathryn Shay. Up to her usual good standard but I do wish whoever was translating from the book to the kindle edition, would check their spelling. Few mistakes but it doesn't distract from the storyline."
2,Snore,"Yawn.Not up to par with her other novels, as the ""redemption"" theme got old as it was repeated over and over.Also, please stay away from cliched ""Southern"" accents.Shockingly enough, the majority of Southerners do not talk like characters from ""Hee Haw"", ""Dukes of Hazzard"" or ""Blue Collar TV."""
3,Very Funny - Completely spur of the Moment.,"This is a collection of messages left on a close friend's of Jonathan Winters answering Machine. All of it right off the top of Jonathan Winter's head. He would call to talk to his friend about something, get the machine, and just start up another rendition of something, that was on his mind at the moment. While the subjects may seem random to us, it was usually something his friend could relate to, and Mr. Smith gives a short preface, about the most of the messages. Some are Very funny! Jim Smith was a close friend to Jonathan & his wife, and worked with him over the years on various projects, including Hee Haw. There is a very nice introduction to the book, and many pictures throughout... It's a different kind of book, because it was all quoted from a caller, that didn't know he was building a book. I guess it made it even all the better."
1,"Lacks musical talent, very typical wannabe sound.","This sounds like a group trying to catch the grunge seen years after it has come and gone. The musical talent is almost non-existant except for the drummer who seems technically perfect, but needs to learn to play with everyone else once in a while. Bottom line: I've heard better neighborhood garage bands, definately ones with more heart."
4,Great guide for visitor or resident alike,"I bought this for my friend who moved to NYC from Portland, OR and she's used it to make a place for herself in that ever changing and ever confusing city! We also used it to pick places to go out to when we went clubbing and out to eat during my visit.I only hope they put out an updated version soon - what was cool in NYC a year ago isn't always so ""hot"" now!"
2,Pocket sized - content that is,"I was very disappointed with this edition. I had seen some of the older Virgin guides and was impressed with their hipness and reviews of places that aren't mentioned in the standard guidebooks.This pocket edition is very small (maybe 2/3rds the height of a standard paperback and less than one inch thick), consequently the listings are, shall we say, sparsely worded. Even the longer ""reviews"" are only one or two sentences.Beware also that this book includes only places to eat, drink and shop. The hotel section is laughable - only a few pages long and one sentence per hotel. Hardly enough info on which to base a decision.That's the overall problem with this book - it might contain the same number of individual listings as the larger version, but they decided to rip out the content (text) in order to make it fit into the pocket size.Not recommended."
4,what makes a good start a creative therapeutic journey.,"I have read the Greek translation of this book and would recommend it as a supervision guide to any counsellor,therapist, GP or teacher. It offers not only suggestions about practical issues of safety, appointment scheduling but also a free-within-boundaries effective and not intrusive client intake that can be psychodynamic, respectful and trustful.There is no topic of difficulty that is not being discussed and the book stresses clearly why it is important to give much attention to the first contact with the client- as it might also be the last!Some issues might sound preliminary yet I suppose are universal within international therapeutic practice and can be applied in various situations.(just a note, the authors describe this book as an easy to read- one may read it in one or two nights, but I would suggest it requires longer time and reflection)."
5,"Great 'LITTLE"" Bag","I wanted a good bag to take with me to they gym but I didn't want a monster of a bag. This bag was perfict, its not a big bag by any means but it holds my shoes, weight belt, raps and still has more than enough room. I could put in a towl, change of cloths or anything else I need to. Just what I wanted."
4,"Geosynthetics - straight forward, crystal clear","Designing with Geosynthetics is the definitive text book for the geotechnical designer and specification writer, yet is simplistic enough for someone with no previous experience with Geosynthetics. The design by function approach is a common-sense straigh-forward concept that helps the reader understand the functionality of these plastic materials within a soil matrix. The text is also a boon to site owners and developers who using traditional methods would not develop a site, but with geosynthetic solutions, may develop the most difficult sites cost effectively."
4,Only 1? What a shame.,"I found this album shortly after it was released and found it a nice break from everything else I was listening to at the time. It's somewhat strange with a battle between electronics and traditional rock instruments but always with a DRIVING rhythm and moving melody. It is definitely a product of it's time but not only is it worth more than the 1 price tag on many of these sellers, pay 5 bucks and listen to it several times. There's some solid material on this album for sure."
1,"A Fundamentally Flawed, Misleading Work","Campbell gets way too much credit for being intelligent. In this book, he severely mocks the Book of Genesis, a very stupid thing to do. Even if one does not believe the narratives of Genesis, its antiquity and terse language (in the original Hebrew) demand respect. Campbell's analysis of Greek myth (more like a pointless exercise in free association) is devoid of understanding. He never grasped that Greek ""myth"" is not myth at all but rather the history of the human race told from the Greeks' unique religious standpoint. For real understanding, I recommend THE PARTHENON CODE: MANKIND'S HISTORY IN MARBLE."
2,Mediocre Comedy Drama,"This film is nothing that you would expect from the cover. Joan Collins looks beautiful as always but the plot of this film is ridiculous and the genres are all mixed up. This movie tries to be a blend of Comedy, Thriller and erotic drama. It doesn't really work out. Joan is very well dressed up the entire film so if you look for her sexy scenes skip this title. David Hasselhof and Telly Savalas also look foolish. This film is a ""Joan Collinas fans only"" type of a movie."
5,Excellent Trainer,"My wife and I each own a mountain bike. A year ago we bought a standard tire-drive trainer - 1) it required changing out the standard knobby tire for a bald tire, and 2) it is still LOUD. A few weeks ago I bought the Minoura 850 rim-drive trainer - 1) it is quiet, and 2) there's no need to change to a bald tire. Also, as opposed to my original tire-drive trainer, the bike doesn't rock side to side, as more force is exerted, when using the rim-drive trainer. The rim-drive Minoura provides plenty of resistance for a solid workout, and it takes, literally, less than 10 seconds to pop my bike out of or in to the setup. That is the entire idea: to be able to use the bicycle as a stationary bike when the weather is bad or it is too dark to ride safely, but to be able to go biking outside whenever possible. And, the price is extremely competitive. I went to a couple of bike shops before deciding to go with the rim-drive - in short, I'm very pleased with my purchase."
4,It works,It does what it is supposed to do. Sets up quickly and disengages quickly.Just put a towel or something under the bike while using indoors. It WILL shed some chain oil while working.
4,Love this,"Watch a DVD, or watch the news, or simply listen to some music while you ride your bike. This was a great purchase, a good investment. Best of all is that you will have 2 bikes instead if one."
4,Stable!,"This product assembled pretty easily, all the parts that I needed were included as well. I have very weak knees, so I was worried about mounting and dismounting before I first used it. However, I can say that this stand is very stable and I feel very safe getting on and off my bike. the only draw back is that the resistance between the lowest level and the highest level is not very significant. I get most of my resistance from the gears on my own bike."
2,Timing of Biologicl Clocks,"One of the problems in ordering on the web, is that you can't check out the problem before it arrives. This book is much more Physics and Math than I expected, with not much of the biological aspects that I needed. It is a good book in its own right, but not enough of the Biology that I expected."
1,zero stars if i could,i bought this dress in a size meduim. it was sent to me at a size 38. it was way to big and i needed it for an important event. not only that i sent it back and still have yet to receive a refund. i am very disappointed in this product. it was an awful experience and i will never shop with a foreign company again. (everything was sent in chinese which mad it even more difficult to send back) two thumbs way down!
4,Evil Xena,"Although the figure lacked in articulation the outfit itself makes this figure worth buying. Especially if you are kit-bashing female fantasy figures. The outfit is durable, well made and very detailed. Her accessories include a sword and the chakram she used as a ranged weapon."
5,Car Care Made Fun,"This book is excellent. It takes the mystery out of how a car runs and what you need to do to keep your car running smoothly. ""Recipes For Car Care"" has made it easy for me to do my own maintenance checks and simple procedures to my car. I can see myself saving hundreds of dollars a year on auto shop visits!! Now I can determine when my brake pads are worn before it is too late. I can also speak intelligently to my mechanic when there is a problem. This book is priceless!!"
5,Love it!,"Great product! Love the natural ingredients, and we haven't experienced any problems with diaper rash or other irritation to baby's skin. I would highly recommend it!"
3,Video details,"Color help from a color expert. How to unlock your color creativity in quilting, fabric, arts, crafts and home decorating."
3,Anne Mather,"After five years apart, Martha had been virtually forced to return to Greece to live with her husband Dion. She soon realized that her feelings for Dion were as strong as ever - but what about him? Wasn't it only too clear that his only reason for wanting her was to get their child back? And could she be sure he wouldn't take her daughter away from her altogether ?"
4,"Clear, concise, and covers most current knowledge..","A short, biceps-friendly ""textbook"" on reproduction that covers most of the current knowledge in the field. Very well organized, and beautifully set up. Look at those colorful pictures and diagrams. I enjoy reading this book very much. But, when we were preparing for our endocrinology exam, we found something in table 3.4, p.39, on luteinizing hormone structure - it says that the beta-subunit of LH has two carobohydrate chains (instead of one?). Hopefully it's just a small typo. Well, nobody's perfect. I still give it nine out of ten."
4,Course Book,I am currently using this book for a college course. The book is perfect for people first learning about mammal reproduction. The book is clearly organized into subjects. I recommend this book for people who want a foundation in reproduction.
3,Lovely and advanced,"This is not a book for beginners! The exercises start at a challenging level and get harder. The illustrations are excellent but the prose is too much to read while trying to follow the instructions. There is no remedial instruction for someone who is having trouble with a particular stretch. All in all, a beautiful choice for advanced stretch or yoga enthusiasts only."
4,ear AND mind candy,"I'm somewhat surprised at some of the reviews here...I thought this disc was of a higher quality than the first. Be that as it may, I was listening to this yesterday and thinking again how great Jill Sobule is. With a wonderful pop sensibility, incredibly clever lyrics and a quirky but somehow likeable voice - she is a melange of Joni Mitchell, Aimee Mann and Cyndi Lauper - if you like aimee mann this artist is a slam dunk."
5,does anybody actuall own this?,"i was just wondering if anybody actuall owns this version of the cd, the one with the bonus track (""de creer en ti"" ranchera version). i've been looking for it everywhere and cannot find it at all. if you know where to find it please help!"
2,Really Helped Me Jump But Ouch...,"I am a seasoned ""A"" level volleyballer. Been playing since high school.I bought these on a whim, after my asics wore out. The shoes look really nice and as noted on the instructions enclosed are designed differently to assist volleyball specific jumping.The shoes indeed made my take offs feel perhaps more controlled and a bit more powerful. Other movement on the court was fine as well. The problem though arose after I finished playing, my feet hurt for days afterwards.I have flat feet and so perhaps this is unique to my condition, so unfortunately the shoes are currently sitting idle in my closet."
3,Fine Shoes,"I wanted a pair of shoes that would only be used for volleyball. Previous to these shoes I was wearing the Nike Free shoes. I wanted the shoes to help me with my vertical (they promise 4% - but I dont agree) and be ""agile"" They are not as good as the Nike Free in those respects but they do provide much more cushion and security from ankle twists than the frees.I would buy them again only because I will only buy a pair every two years and nobody else has the same shoes.Update: Lasted only one volleyball season then fell apart. I paid 120 for them and am sad to see they now sell for 35."
4,"A great shoe for under $40, but don't expect big vertical.","This is probably the best shoe I've bought for under $40, but I noticed no gain in vertical leap. It also takes some getting used to the stiff 'plate' that exists in the sole under the balls of your feet. Otherwise, it performs decently for volleyball. I have not tried the more aggressive insoles yet, as you are supposed to get used to the originals first."
2,Boisterous but not busy,"Very loud. We have a larg dog that likes to counter surf and is always hungry. Thought this would be good for prolonging his mealtime and making it challenging for him. Even though I put small dog food in, it was extremely difficult to get the food out. He gave up after about 5 minutes. Was disappointed in product."
5,Great toy to leave with my dog!,"I bought this toy and the buster cube to be able to leave with my dog on the couple of days he is home alone so that he at least gets a little excitement. He absolutely loves it, and I recommend it to anyone. I bought mine before they 'upgraded' to a rubber rope part, but he has only gotten the knot open once so it's not a problem. It dispenses food quickly enough to keep him interested, and even once he's done eating he still likes to chew on the rubber and rope a little. I think it was definitely worth the money and recommended it to our local vet who is now carrying it in stock."
4,Keeps dog busy,"Dog broke the hard plastic the first day by slamming it around by the rope so we have to tape it up everytime we refill. Dog does enjoy, carries it around wanting to play fetch but settles on tug a war. It does keep him occupied trying to get the food out. Container needs to be made of different material to prevent breakage but still worth the money for the enjoyment it has given him."
4,Good for fast eaters,"I put my dog's kibble meals in this so she doesn't gobble it up so fast. She seems to think it's fun, and will work until she's gotten every last piece out. I've had one for about a year and it's still in good condition except the rope is gross, so I wanted to replace it. I ordered the small, which is pictured with a rubber piece instead of rope (thought it would be easier to clean), but I received a small with rope. I definitely recommend this product as an alternative to the ""slow down"" bowls or for dogs that need extra stimulation. I have a medium sized, non-destructive dog and this product does hold up over time."
3,"Big, tough, dogs don't like it","I got the medium/large toy and it is really big. I have two large dogs and only one of them can carry this around. It is definitely a tough toy, but my dogs only play with it when there are treats inside. Then they get the treats out and don't touch it again until I put more treats in it. I thought they would chew on it even when no treats were inside because they always want plastic bottles which I don't like them to have. Overall, this toy is durable and a good toy if your dog will play with it."
3,maybe for another dog,"It seems like a nice durable toy but my dog could care less. A few sniffs, nose up, and that was that. Doesn't matter what treats are in it or even if we dispense them. I thought it would be nice for a bored dog, but this is a dog that, apparently, prefers boredom to gastric pleasure. I gave it 3 stars because it does seem to be well constructed, but not five stars since it was utterly pointless purchase, at least for me."
2,"Great concept, but my dogs find little interest in it","It's a sturdy jug and easy to fill with treats. My dogs, however, do not find it interesting and have spent little to no time playing with it."
5,great dog toy,I got this toy for my two pomeranians and the boy just loves it. He has a high food drive anyway but just put some good smelling treats in this and he will play with it until they all come out. It's easy to load with just a few but if you put their whole day's food in it you have to hold you hand over the rubber ball so they won't spill out.
4,Dog Loves it,"My 13 lb dachshund is extremely destructive with his toys and needs a lot of interaction with most toys constantly. I filled this toy with organic cheerio type cereal and he was delighted. It took him about 3 minutes to work out how to get the treats out.I dropped a star because he is able to pull small chunks off the purple molding. I sort of expected that because he is like that with everything though. Luckily, he spits the rubber out after he pops it off, so I can let him play with it when I am home to supervise his play."
3,"Nice enough, but...","My dog just isn't a ""tugger"" by nature. She doesn't get this toy, and the same hard plastic that makes it super durable also makes it super LOUD when it hits the hardwood floor. Noise=scary. My dog developed a phobia of this toy long before she ever figured out how to get the food out of it. I had to pass it along to someone else. Hopefully it will find a home with a dog who really loves it."
3,Cute...but not Westie-proof,"Got this for my West Highland Terrier for Christmas and she loved it. It kept her busy as soon as we gave it to her. She was completely focused on getting those treats out of the bottle...however, she re-invented the toy and got all of the treats out by actually chewing through the thick rope that is attached to the toy. (She managed to do this in about 5 minutes in a roomful of people.) It's a cute toy and a great concept - and she did enjoy it - however, I think this toy would work best with a dog who is not quite as focused, or creative in problem-solving as our westie seems to be. The plastic bottle and rubbery ball are very sturdy and are continuing to hold up well."
3,My dog never figured this out,"I followed all the instructions and great guidance from this site, but my dog - a rescue dog, formerly an outside dog and not used to 'toys' didn't figure this out. Perhaps if another dog showed him the way, he'd get it. The product otherwise was well-made and a creative idea!"
2,"Cool, but my dog quickly destroyed it","I wanted to use this as an alternative to a Kong, to fill with lunch for my dog on days when she would be alone all day while I was at work, and my husband was out of town. The product arrived with a rubber ""rope"" with a ball-like bulge on the outside, and a cone-shaped plug on the inside, rather than the actual rope pictured on the page. For the first 3 days, it was wonderful. She was very excited and interested in how it worked, and it seemed to keep her occupied. On the fourth day, when I got home, I saw her chewing on the little ball-like bulge, which she had handily chewed off of the rubber ""rope"". I worry that she would be able to chew off other pieces, and that she could choke on a lump of rubber that size, so I haven't used the product since then. Too bad, because it seemed neat. I would only recommend this product if your dog is a VERY weak chewer."
2,"The ""rope"" is actually rubber. Chewed through it in seconds.",The rope part of the toy that the dog is supposed to tug on to get the treats out is rubber and not rope as shown in the product pocture. My 45lb border collie mix chewed through that in almost record time.He really likes the toy. He just picks it up now by the knobby top and drops it to get the treats out. I will probably try to put an actual rope and stopper in to fix it. I am just disappointed that it wasn't as shown.
1,Wish they hadn't changed this toy,"I originally purchased this item back in March of last year. It worked out great with my yellow lab in dispensing a meal a day. This version of the toy had an actual rope coming out of the jug. After about half a year, the rope wore through, but given the low price of the toy, I was satisfied with 6 months of heavy use and recommended it to friends.I then purchased a replacement end of last year. Unfortunately, the manufacturers had changed the toy so now it's a rubber rope in place of the original fiber one. This toy lasted about 15 minutes before my dog had completely chewed through it, making the toy nearly useless.5 stars for the original version, 1 for new and unimproved."
2,Use a Plastic Coke Bottle Instead,"So I bought this thing and my cockapoo wouldn't touch it, I played with her with it and tried to show her how it worked and even rubbed cheese on it, but she never figured it out. So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually. Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy. I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope. She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope. I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle."
2,Great--for two days,"My puppy is under 40 pounds, and loved this toy. He chewed the rope apart in one day. Well, I unscrewed the bottom and inserted a golf ball. It did the job of the rope and made it tough to shake out the treats. Kept the pup occupied for two hours. Then he figured out that tossing the bottle would shake loose the treats. the plastic bottle cracked in minutes.This would be an excellent toy if the plastic was tougher. the design is great, especially with the ball addition."
3,Really for bigger dogs,I didn't realize this was so big until I got it. I ended giving it to my Fiance's mom for her GSD.
1,"My dog loves everything, but hates this.","I wasted my money. I tried putting different cereal, dog foods, etc. in this, and my dog ignores it completely."
2,not for a chewer,"My 10 month old Lab needed some brain toys, and this seemed like an ideal option. There is a problem to solve, and the reward is food - what could be better for a Lab? The problem is that she is a chewer, and though she did figure out pretty readily how to get the food out, she was way more interested in chewing on the rope. When I removed the rope - which also made it way easier to get the food out - she then thought it would be more gratifying to chew her way to the food, rather than rise to the intellectual challenge of tipping the bottle and dispensing a treat.And oh yes, this thing is loud when it hits the floor or cabinets in the kitchen, etc. Pretty durable, considering all she wants to do is chew it and it's not intended as a chew toy - but she has only spent maybe two hours with it total."
2,scared dog!,"A friend with a golden retriever reported that he adored this item, so I thought I would try it, as many of her suggestions have met with my own dog's approval. But not this one! Despite the alluring scent of treats inside, he found the bottle too big for his comfort, and would back away from it. He is a coton de tulear, weighing about 15 pounds, and I bought the size for small dogs. The plastic bottle apparently still was too big for his comfort."
2,Not a great toy for chewers,"I think my dog was just too smart for this toy. I purchased one of the larger ones with the rubber rope. After 5 minutes of frustration in trying to get the treats out, my dog chewed through the rubber rope so that she could just empty the treats out the hole. It was a waste of money for my dog to try out. With the fabric-type rope, the toy might have lasted longer for her."
1,Rope chewed in less than an hour,"Was excited about this tough toy, but gave it to our 96 lb puppy who tore the rope apart in less than an hour. He is usually really good with toys that dispense treats but this time since he couldn't figure out the pulling, because it wasn't really working, he just decided to chew the rope. Threw it away because it was also too noisy and scratching up the wood floors."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"My 10 month old Golden Doodle had chewed through the rope within 30 minutes. The ""bottle"" part is hard plastic and very loud when bounced around. The knot on the rope (when we still had a rope) fit too tightly into the opening making getting treats out of the bottle close to impossible. I had hoped this would be one of those toys to occupy her a bit more. And for the price, think the rope would have been somewhat tougher to a chewer like mine.If your dog is a chewer I can't recommend this. Not what I expected or hoped for....."
1,My inquisitive Blue Heeler was not interested in this at all.,"This one baffled me. My Blue Heeler loves ""figure it out"" kind of toys, but she was not interested in this at all, not even for 2 minutes. I put her favorite treats it, spent days trying to intrigue her, but to no avail. Maybe it'll work for somebody else. Pay my shipping and I'll send you mine for free!"
1,Destructible,I have a 10 pound Yorkie who admittedly destroys most toys we give him. I thought this toy would be an exception based upon other reviews. He has a ball that he rolls around that dispenses food and seems to enjoy it and it has lasted longer than most of the other toys. For this reason I thought he would love this toy. Less than 36 hours later he became so frustrated in not being able to get the treats that he tore the rope in two.
2,"Good idea, dog enjoyed it, broke immediately",Our dog enjoyed this for 10 minutes and the bottom broke. The part that screws in the bottom cracked. I'm very disappointed.
1,Very easy to destroy! Not worth the money,"I bought one of these last year for my pittie mix who was less than a year old, he LOVED it at first and had a great time throwing, kicking and rolling it all over the floor to get to the treats. Then he started holding the jug down with his paws and puling up on the ""rope,"" which didn't take long to tear in half. I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea. He started chewing on the rubber at the top of the jug and it came apart in pieces - thank goodness he didn't swallow any! So I figured once again that maybe it would still be useful once I removed the rest of the rubber bits that were torn, again I was wrong. He started to chew on the top of the jug itself (can't blame him it did smell like treats!) and the plastic quickly became jagged and sharp. In less than 24 hours this toy was in pieces and in the trash. It was definitely NOT worth the almost $20 I spent on it!"
3,Short Lived,"The Tug-A-Jug is a cleverly designed toy that does a good job of entertaining/occupying a dog, but my 85 pound Weimaraner destroyed the largest model inside of a few hours. It's also noisy for indoor use."
2,Not Lab durable...,My 7 month old lab mastered the toy in about an hour. He managed to chew through the rope and render this toy about as useful as a gatorade bottle with no top.
2,NOT for tough chewers!!!,"We have a lab who is a TOUGH chewer...this lasted about a week.I got the first one with the rope top, and our dog chewed through the rope in 5 minutes and had the purple ball off in another 10 minutes. I made the mistake of using Gorilla Glue to put it back on, then realized that its really bad for dogs so threw that one away.Ordered another one--this time with the rubber rope--and our dog was through the rope in about 20 minutes, again got the purple ball off in another 10 minutes, and went to work on the neck of the bottle. A week later we had to toss it because he had chewed off the neck of the bottle and it was cracked all down the sides.He did LOVE it while he had it...but $10 for a week of entertainment is a bit much..."
3,Not for people with hardwood floors,"Our dog does enjoy this toy, but the constant slamming on our wood floors is annoying. The rubber part actually lasted a month, which is a record for our chewer."
1,lame,"My dogs who will generally ""play"" or destroy any toy had no interest. I tried placing everything short of hotdogs into the jug with no avail."
5,Perfect for Power-Chewers!,"Our 16 month old yellow lab loves to play with empty 2 liter pop bottles. I bought him this toy because I worried he would cut his mouth and gums on the sharp plastic shards of those flimsy bottles. No worry about that with the Tug-a-Jug...this toy will most likely survive through the next millennium!To fill with treats, just twist off the bottom; couldn't be easier. It's a lot of fun watching our dog figure out how to get at the goodies inside.I honestly don't think the rope pull is going to last very long; especially if you are buying this for an aggressive chewer. However, don't let that stop you from buying the tug-a-jug. Even without the rope, it's still a great and challenging toy."
3,Love the Idea But Not as Great in Practice for Us,"Length:: 1:01 MinsTucker was nervous about this toy at first (as you'll see in the video) but really warmed up to it quickly and has enjoyed gnawing on it. However, this has not worked very well for us as a treat dispenser. I consider Tucker to be quite a clever puppy, but after fiddling with the tug-a-jug for a couple days, he just began bringing the thing to me and dropping it at my feet for me to dispense the treats for him. (I suppose that may be evidence of just how clever he is!)"
1,Tug-a-Jug lasts 5 minutes.,I was very disappointed with the tug-a-jug. It came in the mail today. The dog had it for 5 minutes and she had the rubber rope chewed in half in that short amount of time. A waste of money for me. I have yet to find something that this black lab doesn't destroy in record time.
1,Dog Danger,"I purchased two of these for our labs at Christmas. I filled them with their usual training treats, and the dogs loved them...they played with them for about 30 minutes trying to get to the treats. Then...the two dogs figured if they bit off the ball on the end of the rope, they could get the treats to fall out sooner. Yup...within 30 minutes the plastic ropes were destroyed. It could really be a danger to dogs if swallowed. (This is why I watch the dogs when they get new toys...and thank goodness I did.)Anyhow, totally disappointed with the product, it's safety and the price. THESE TOYS ARE NOT LAB-TOUGH!"
4,Great for tough chewers,"I have 2 pit bulls that love to chew and this toy has suprising lasted a few months. The rubber on it can be chewed off (so supervision is required), but even with chunks of it gone, it still works great and keeps them busy. Besides the rubber being no challenge to chew through (especially the cord), the biggest down sides are that the plastic is so hard that it could damage some furniture (and feet) and it is loud when they throw it around"
5,Sanity saver,I have a 6 month old lab puppy who is way too smart for her own good. She is into everything and I swear suffers from ADD. I got this so I could have a few moments peace and it worked! Now she has to work for her dinner and it gives me 1/2 hour at a time not to have to worry about her getting into other stuff.
4,Tug-A-Jug Treat Toy,"Dogs like it, which is probably the main point. We had a hard time finding non-dry dog food treats to put inside this toy. Still, the dogs seemed to have a jolly time with it and they didn't complain about the lack of treat variety."
3,Good concept,This is a great idea though our golden retriever grew impatient. I think it was more attractive to chew on the spiky ball end and the rope. Great concept but we've owned two and the kibble didn't seem to come out as easily as it sounded and our dog grew bored waiting for something to fall out. Also our second unit the rope unravelled on its' own after the second use.
5,highly durable,"Our corgi, Stout, LOVES this toy. Especially if you put a piece of abully stick or something smelly in it he will mess with it (and leave you in peace) for hours."
1,"Lasted 5 minutes, item not as pictured","My dog chewed up the ""rope"" that stops up the bottle into dangerously large pieces in a manner of minutes. Note that in the ""Medium/Large"" photos for this item the stopper appears to be an actual purple and white rope, but the item I received had the solid purple soft rubber ""rope"" that appears in the ""Small"" photos. This design is completely unsuited for even moderately powerful chewers. I never would have bought this item had the photographs been accurate."
2,Not As Described,"I think this toy has potential, but it didn't come as pictured. The rope is not actually a rope, it's a plastic mimic of a rope and my dog can't seem to figure out that he can tug at it like he can his tug rope. He quickly figured out all the other busy buddy toys and the buster cube, so I assume the rope just seems too foreign. I am going to buy an actual tug tope that will fit and try that instead. Will update review once I do this."
1,Broke,This did not last 15 seconds with our dog. Chewed the piece that inserts into the bottle.DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Not Very Durable,"Sorry, folks, but my pit bull mix destroyed this toy in less than two hours. He even ripped off the top and chipped the indestructible plastic... if you have a ""busy"" dog, this is probably not for you."
1,probably the most dangerous toy I ever purchased,My dogs play constabtly with plastic and rubber type treat toys. I have never has one break before. This bottle on a rope smashed in two places the first day I gave it to my dogs leaving jagged edges at the neck of the bottle and the bottom screw on lid. It was not made to withstand shaking and banging the toy on the ground which dogs generally do with toys on ropes.
2,Needs to be stronger,"I have two boxers, male and female. After about 30 minutes of the expected use, the male grabbed the end of the rope, shook and shattered the plastic threaded bottom right off the bottle against the corner of a door frame.Concept is intriguing for the dogs but the plastic is too brittle. They didn't have the toy long enough to get to chewing on the rubber ball at the end."
2,Fragile bottom splits easily,"My dog loves the tug-a-jug. I've bought three of them and on all of them the bottom has split. The bottom edges and threads split and break off. My dog isn't particularly hard on the toy either, it's only used on the carpet and she doesn't swing it around into walls or furniture. She stands it up, knocks it over and drags it by the rope along the floor with her paws. I really want to recommend this product, but I can't afford to replace it every three to five uses."
2,Broken Tooth,"Our dachshund LOVED this jug! But once she really learned how to do it she wound up doing it so hardthat the jug would slam back and hit her. She didn't apparently mind that but it broke her right canine tooth. Hence, this cost us $2500 for a route canal!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my 20lb puppy on the advice of my trainer. What a disaster! Not only was I bruised from her swinging it around trying to get the treats out, but so were my walls and furniture. Within a week the plastic jug broke and that was the end of it."
3,Tug a jug,This toy is not so good if the treats or kibble is too big..... even small kibbles have a hard time getting out of the jug. I think this toy needs to be re-designed----My dog kept trying to pick up the jug from it's base so he can tip it up side down but the jug was too big to be picked up and made of slippery plastic (he's a Newfoundland with a big mouth). He learned how to dump the food out with empty soda bottles that I would put kibble in. It took a long time for him to get his food out and then at the end when there was only a little left he didn't want to play anymore because they would not come out. I think I will either take the rope out or drill a small hole at the tid of the jug to make it more fun.
3,Doesn't take a genius to figure it out,"We bought this for our dog as a way to feed him his kibble and entertain him for about 20 minutes a day at the same time. Out of the box, it took him about 10 minutes to figure it out and empty it of the 1 1/2 cups of small kibble. If we fed larger kibble, it might take longer. But because I had read other reviews, I knew this to be the case and followed the advice of others on here. I added somesmall tennis ballsto the jug and then threw the kibble in on top of it. That helped in 2 ways. First, the kibble didn't spill out of the neck while I was filling it from the bottom. Second, it slowed down the amount of time it took our dog to empty it (about half an hour).Just a word of warning: you will have kibble all over your floor until the dog goes back to eat it up. Ours is pretty good about going back to clean up after himself but you have to have patience that he will do that."
3,Not for chewers,"I Initially liked it but when left alone with my dog, her chewed thru the rope and plunger rendereing it useless. Lasted less then a week with my destroyer of a dog."
3,Too easy,"I have a dachshund/terrier mix who is 2 years old. I bought him the Busy Buddy for the same reason everyone else probably does: he needed more mental stimulation. I brought the toy home, loaded it up, and offered it to my dog. He quickly figured out the rope was restricting the flow of treats. He promptly chewed through the rope, leaving a knot in the bottom of the bottle and the rest of the rope and other knot on the floor. Without this restriction he figured out (within a matter of minutes) that if he threw the bottle into the air, the bottle would bounce, sending a treat or two flying out of the mouth and onto the floor. It should also be noted that this toy IS breakable. However, your pup would have to have pretty strong jaws like my dog's.Synopses: Great toy if your dog isn't smart enough to chew through the rope or try to break the koosh ball."
2,No Match for a Boxer,"My 3 yr old 75lb boxer is a heavy chewer and has a really long attention span to toys that give him a challenge. So at first this seemed like a promising toy. It lasted maybe one week before my boxer figured out that picking it up in his mouth then dropping, no slamming, it on my hardwood floor gets pieces of food out. The end cap, which screws on and is plastic, never stood a chance. it broke off and I was able to screw it on once more before bits of plastic shards were on my floor and victory was his.It now sadly sits in the dogs toy box he doesnt like it anymore now that it doesnt dispense treats. lol. I wish I could get my money back or get a new plastic screw cap for it."
2,Quickly spills out the treats,My 12 month old lab puppy can grasp the bottle in her mouth and shake out all of the treats. It took her less than a minute to figure this out and eat all of the treats. I was very disappointed in this dog toy.
2,Can be dangerous,"I have purchased many Premier brand products and liked them, especially the Busy Buddy dog toys. However, the Tug-a-jug is not one of them. The treats do not dispense as easily as some of their other products so some dogs may get discouraged. My dog stopped playing with it due to that. The tug-a-jug can be a dangerous toy being made out of very hard plastic almost as hard as glass. If one dog is swinging it, it can injure another animal standing by. It also can do damage to furniture, walls, etc. I purchased the large size. Today my dog found it after not using it for a very long time and was playing with it and cracked and broke the whole end off leaving sharp plastic edges. Luckily I noticed it right away or my dog could have ingested that! I did buy it in 2009 but my dog hardly ever played with it so I am not sure how long they would last if a dog played with it frequently. Premier has so many other wonderful dog toys to chose from."
2,smart dog,"Our Cocker spaniel can manage to get socks out of closed drawers and food out of closed cupboards but after repeated attempts to show how to use this item, he still doesn't get it. It was purchased to help keep him entertained while we were at work. He likes the Busy Buddy squirrel but this one is a bust."
1,Broke in 2 days with tiny dogs,"My 2 tiny chihuahuas carried this around the yard a few times and it broke the 2nd day. NOT recommended, Waste of money!"
1,good idea BUT...,my dog has problem-solved this device: he chews the rope part until it's severed. if the rope was stronger or made of some kind of dog-friendly indestructible plastic i would give it 5 stars. i was going to give it 5 stars because initially it was perfect and kept him amused for HOURS! but that lasted a week :( SO now we have the Kibble Nibble Twist Treat Ball - which is working still.
3,Danger,"This toy is just ok: if it broke I would not replace it but I wouldn't say it was a waste of money. My border collie really seems to like it and would bring it over to play with it. It took him a day or two but he did eventually figure out how to get food from it. He didn't seem to like being fed from it though, and really preferred the kong or omega toy for meals. When my dog got sick of trying to get the food out he would whip the toy around by the rope. It is very heavy filled with food and it's made of really tough plastic. Once he whipped it around and it hit me in the shin- very painful. It hasn't caused any damage to our house, though I imagine it could."
2,Not for me,"My dog loves all of his toys. He's a border collie, everything is interesting and fun to him......except for this item. He won't play with it. He could care less that there is food in it. One of the problems might be that this toy is REALLY loud on tile floors. If it hurts my ears when he does attempt to mess with it, I could only image how his ears feel. The other issue is that he is more toy driven than food driven.This might be a good toy for food motivated dogs.This might be a good toy if you have carpet.I didn't like it and neither did my dog."
3,My dog doesn't get it... but I think he has fun with it?,"I was hoping this would teach my rescue about playing with a rope toy, but he doesn't really understand it. He just jumps around with it and treats kind of fall out. He isn't a chewer like some reviews, so he hasn't chewed it at all. He also gets bored with it after a while, probably because he doesn't get it yet. But it does get him to play, something I dont think his original owner encouraged, and wears him out!"
2,Great idea - poor quality rope,"Well this certainly didn't last long with my german shepard mix puppy. It less than an hour she had shredded the rope, splitting it into two pieces. Once the knot in the jug dropped to the bottom she was able to empty all the treats quickly. I used it again with larger treats inside and no rope. That worked for about 20 minutes until she ripped the nub coating off the neck of the bottle and started crushing the neck portion. I had to take it away and toss it, getting only 2 uses and less than 2 hours out of it."
2,Broke the first time it was used,"I wanted to like this item and had seen the generally favorable reviews. I loaded it with some liver treats and opened our front door to offer it to my dog-- she grabbed the rope and released it...and it fell about two feet onto the step and cracked! I was pretty surprised it took that little to break it. The crack was on the screw-in bottom so it spread and basically the bottom broke and it was useless...back to Amazon, sorry! Maybe a rubber guard for the bottom would make this a better product?"
1,NOT for genius dogs,I bought this on the recommendation from someone that also had a siberian husky. All i can say is that their husky must be fairly old. My 6 mth old siberian husky is very active & a heavy chewer. She figured out how to unscrew the bottom of the jug in one day-then proceeded to chew it to pieces.
1,Lasted one day,"This is a great idea and I had such high hopes. My 8 mo old Shepherd is very active and rough. We have tile floors in the house and concrete outside. The dog slung this toy around, knee capping me a few times before slamming it on the tile floor and breaking it open. It it were made of hardier material I would buy another but this plastic is just too brittle for a rough dog."
1,Good for a couple days,"My lab chewed up the rope in a couple hours. This alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope. However, before I could even place a ball in it, the plastic developed a large crack from the dog just carrying his toy around the house and dropping it on our carpetted floors. He has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage."
3,Loved the toy but the indestructible plastic broke!!,"I have a 3 year old black lab named Layla who LOVED the busy buddy. It got to the point where she enjoyed having some of her meals put in the toy each day. Layla never really chewed on the toy, just picked it up and dropped it, etc. After about 2 weeks though the screw off bottom developed a crack that eventually split the top. The plastic on the screw off top doesn't seem as thick or sturdy as the rest. I thought about buying this toy again, but decided to try a treat toy made of rubber which is her new infatuation! If you have a gentle dog and carpet try this toy out, but if you have a large one and hardwood floors maybe think twice!"
2,I was frustrated watching her try to get the treats!,"I was very excited when the Tug-a-Jug arrived. I was looking for new toys to keep my 1 1/2 yr old Lhasa busy. This did keep her busy. It kept her busy trying to get at the treats that she could see and smell without any reward. The treats only come out when I turn it upside down and play with the rope. I felt bad watching her trying to get the treats, and she tried so hard for such a long time. There is no way she would be able to turn it upside down. It is also SO loud. We had to take it off her the first day because my husband and I could not hear each other talking! It was a waste of money. We will stick with Kong dispensers."
3,"great idea, but didn't attract players","I got the large size for my siberian husky. He sniffed around the treat-filled bottle and turned away. I tried to show him how to get the treats out by pulling the rope, rolling the bottle, etc, he watched me doing it, and still not interested in trying for himself. He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug-a-jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it. Later I introduced this toy to my coworker, who has a little puggle, and he immediately got one. He puggle chewed up the spiked ball on the bottle neck within 5 minutes...so I guess it's not that durable then."
2,didn't last long,"My pup and I really enjoyed this in the beginning. She very quickly learned how to hold the rope with one paw and tip the bottle with the other to get food out. We were starting to learn some other things (adding balls inside to change how the food fell out, etc). Screwing the cap on was always difficult, with it needing to be lined up exactly right. Soon, however, the threads broke off the bottle so that we could no longer screw the ""cap"" on. Now it is useless."
3,not good for chewers,"I got this for my 60lb boxer mix as a replacement for smaller one he had managed to break by dropping it. It was great for a couple days, but after that he seemed to get frustrated & in a mere 24 hours, he had chewed through the much thicker rope on the new one, which he had never thought of doing on the old one. Another new toy, doomed to failure. <sigh> oh well, at least I tried."
2,Break easily,"My dogs are not rough at all, one is 4 years old and still has toys from when she was a puppy. Within one week, she broke the cap into 3 pieces anf got all the kibble, Superglued it back together which lasted another week.I would not purchase again. I went for the hard plastic Kong that dispense hard kibble. They have barely scratched it although they can get the food out more quickly. I throw larger treats in to slow dispensing action."
2,Not recommended for tough chewers,"If your dog isn't a chewer/destroyer-of-toys like mine, this might be fine. But my lab destroyed the rope and ate the plastic stopper very quickly. Also, keep in mind if you live above someone and don't have carpets, the dog will repeatedly drop the bottle on the floor to get the treats out. So had my dog not eaten this toy, I still couldn't have used it very often because it's very loud."
2,"Awesome food toy, but not durable at all!","This toy is phenomenal. It keeps both of our dogs (1 silky terrier, 1 boston terrier) busy, and actually keeps my boston's farting problem at bay (I'm serious). The only downside is the plastic top that you have to screw off/on to put food into it is NOT durable. I called customer service and they sent me a new one, but they sounded surprised because the tug-a-jug is apparently made of ballistic plastic (I don't even know what that means). The 5 jugs I've gone through say otherwise...Note: I will continue to buy these anyways."
1,Broke in less than a week,"I was very disappointed when this toy broke in less than a week. It was advertised as being durable plastic, but it couldn't stand up to our beagle dropping it repeatedly to get the treats out. The plastic lid on the bottom cracked and broke off less than a week after our dog began playing with the toy. The broken plastic pieces are very sharp and would have been dangerous if our dog had not been supervised."
1,Not the toy for my dog,"I bought this for my lab thinking it would be a fun challenging toy for him, but he has never even touched it. I put treats in it and he wouldn't go near this toy! I tried to give it to my mom's labs and they didn't want anything to do with it either."
4,Durable enough for a Mastiff,"I am always looking for play toys for my 120lb, 2 yr old Mastiff. So far the ONLY toys that lasy over 2 days are the Kong brands (which I HIGHLY recommend). But anyways, this toy keeps him entertained for a long time here are my pro's & cons for it:Pro:-not expensive-has several different areas to hold his interest (the bottle, the rubber spike ball & the rope)-durableCons:-If your dog shakes toys around then that hard heavy plastic bottle can do some damage to you or your walls-your dog may do what mine does & bring me the toy to set it up for him to get treats, defeats the purpose of him figuring it out-my dog didnt love the treats that are made for the toy, so I just bought small size dog treats & cut them in half, works great!The pro's definitely outweigh the cons & I highly recommend this to other dog owners, especially ones that are strong & destroy other toys"
3,"Great for some, not so great for other personalities","This toy has recently been added to our food dispensing toy collection. My large dog enjoys it (while my small dog ignores it) and can stick to playing with it for a long time, swinging it around, banging it against the floor, pulling, etc. Other dogs, however, would easily get frustrated. It takes a lot of work to get a very small amount of treats out. In fact, the more the dog manipulates it, the fewer treats seem to come out.So I'd recommend this for a dog that doesn't get frustrated easily, who is very food driven, has focus, and doesn't mind being assertive with their toys. This isn't a toy that a nose can lightly push around for treats.Like a lot of other treat dispensing toys, nothing on here should really be allowed to be chewed on (except for the rope portion and the purple, spiky cap), and it shouldn't be given around stairs so it can drop down and break."
1,"Neat idea, but not good for strong chewers.",My dog had this for 30 minutes before he chewed through the knot. He then went on to chewing the rubber off the nozzle. My dog was 9mo old and weighed 26lbs. Loved the idea of it. Disappointed that I spent $12 on a toy that lasted less then an hour.
3,Quick Fix,"My dog managed to chew threw the rubber tug in less than 30 seconds. That being said, I can't say that the toy is a total loss. I turned the leftover part upside down in the jug and it is fairly effective at slowing down the dispensation of the food treats that are inside. Keeps mine amused for as long as the food is in there"
3,Smart Siberian Husky,"At first this was a great toy, lasted forever. but then the smart husky figured out how to unscrew the cap, it was all over then."
2,Did not last long.,"The container itself is very strong, but our 40 lb springer spaniel chewed the rope apart in less than 15 minutes so she could get all of the treats."
3,For light chewers only,"My parents have a Carolina Dog who is not a big chewer. She loves this toy, and it keeps her occupied for a while. Seeing how much she loved it, I decided to get one for my 1 year old beagle. Within an hour or so, he had the rope completely chewed up which takes away the real intention of the toy. He still plays with the bottle itself, but there's no point in putting treats in it because they just fall out. This toy is not for hardcore chewers."
1,Treat smell is stronger at wrong end!,"This seemed like a great toy, until my dogs had in for 10 seconds.The end the treats come out of has rubber parts (which smell strongly of, well, rubber) and the opposite end (that no treats ever come out of) has little holes drilled in it.This makes the smell of the treats MUCH stronger from the WRONG END of the toy.Both of my dogs were scratching and licking at the end that they could actually SMELL the treats through, and actually backed away from the strong smell of the rubber.The other treat-dispensing toys have been too easy for my dogs, but this one does not seem to be made for an animal that relies so heavily on it's sense of smell."
1,not for chewing puppies!,"Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble has been a great toy for my dog, but Tug-a-Jug was not. Within 10 minutes, she had gnawed the ""challenge"" rope into 6 pieces. Maybe it's good for an older dog but definitely not for my vigorously chewing 8-month-old puppy!"
2,Broke in less than an hour.,"I bought this product to occupy my 13-month-old mix. She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough. When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour. At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber ""pull"" was already in pieces. While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does. Especially for eleven dollars!"
4,ok,"The ""small size"" is ok for a medium size dog (maybe a boxer or a cocker). My dog, a Boston terrier, became a little bit frustrated because she hasn't been able to recover the treats, but she like it. She keeps trying! The matherials seem to be durable."
2,Its not very strudy,"I bought this for my 16 pound whoodle, and within 4 days she was able to crack the bottle and ripped apart the rope that was attached to it. I wouldn't purchase it again, but the concept was good."
5,Our Dog Continues To Play with his Jug,"Pets at first normally play with their new toys but then they abandon them, but this one is one his plays with quite often!"
5,Excellent,"WOW, this is a cool dog toy. Have a year and half old Rat Terrier that absolutely loves this thing. I did have to fill it up full(I use cat food) at beginning so she would get rewarded aften but now there is no problem. She drags it around the house and plays with it until its empty."
1,Great while it lasted,My one year old Lab. loved the bottle filled with his kibble. The kibble fell out when tossed around. He carried the bottle into the kitchen started tossing it and it cracked when it hit the tile floor at the screw end ALL kibble fell out and it broke into sharp pieces and it was a scramble to get the piece before he tried to eat and swallow them. You know Labs they will eat anything halfway looking like food. The bottle is not very durable on hard surfaces. The same would have happened on the patio deck I am sure. Expensive for the 30 minutes he used it.
2,My Dogs completely ignore it.,"I purchased this for my dogs. One is a male 13 yrs old sharpei/golden retriever mix, another is a female 4 yrs old black lab, and the other is a 1 yr old great pyrenees. All of them ignore it completely! They seem to like the kong with treats in it best or the buster cube or a toy similar. However my sister's dog is a mix of german shepard and she loves this toy. So it kind of depends on the dog. Some dogs love it, some dogs ignore it."
2,Amazing feeding tool! Except for the dirty rope...,"This is a wonderful toy and feeding tool. This keeps my 33-lb/4-month-old puppy busy for a good 20 minutes and after he's eaten all the food, he can chew on the rope. It's easy to clean, which is a BIG plus! This is a wonderful alternative to the Buster Cube. I also have the small Twist and Treat and both are great toys to keep him occupied......This toy was great except after a few months of using it, the rope got extreme dirty and smelly and this was difficult to clean, so in the end, I had to toss it out."
2,Too much for pup,I have a lab puppy that is starting to put on too much weight. No surprise there. I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him. He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that. Know your dogs preferences when purchasing these types of food toys.
2,Not for a large puppy or chewer,"I bought this for my 6 month old lab puppy. He figured out how to get the treats and it was his favorite entertainment. However, he swung it around from the rope (it's made to do that) and within weeks had broken the plastic top by hitting it against the floor so it could no longer be used. For a $20 item, I expect longer use, and to have plastic shards around a puppy is just dangerous! Great toy/food dspenser in thoery, but just too fragile!"
3,It's a good toy but not as fun to play with as other toys.,"I gave this to my dogs to see how they'd take to it. They both seem confused by it. At first it just sat on the floor, untouched for a couple of days. I figured I'd try to lure them into playing with it by putting some really really yummy people food in it for them to sniff out. That definitely worked. But they lose interest in the toy itself once the treats are gone. Unlike another toy I purchased that they play with whether or not it has treats in it.You have to show your dog how the treats slide out when you tug on the rope. I don't think my dogs are stupid but they just didn't get it until I went over it a couple of dozen times with them."
1,My dog is having nothing to do with it.,"I consider my Sheltie to be an intelligent dog, but the noise of the toy makes him back away. And I can't tell you how many times I've ""demonstrated"" how to get the kibble out. He just waits until I do it. He could care less about the thing, and he's very food motivated."
3,Strong chewers whipped it in an hour,"My dog just got mad they couldn't get the treats out and ripped the rope right out.He's a pretty strong chewer but not extraordinary. He's only a 70 lb coonhound.Just an FYI to ya'll. I thought it was a little difficult for them to get treats but maybe my dogs aren't the smartest.Anyway, the search continues for the perfect dog toy."
3,not for a rope chewer,within five minutes my 11 month old 60 lb collie/saint Bernard mix had chewed the rope in half. I used suggestion given by another reviewer and put a racket ball in the bottle.
3,My Dog Chewed This Up,My beagle really enjoyed working to get his treats out of this ball for the first couple days then he chewed through the rubber piece for tugging so now if we put treats in they just fall out.
3,not as good as the previous model,"We had an earlier model of this jug, with a rope instead of the rubber ""rope."" My dog was able to get the food out a little easier, which I preferred. This rubber thing in the middle quite effectively blocks the food and my dog gives up. She used to eat her whole meal everyday in the old jug. So I am disappointed they changed it."
3,"Pretty good, but doesn't hold my dog's interest","My Westie liked this at first, but it didn't really hold his interest. Plus, you have to fill the bottle about half full. He gets bored after removing a few items, and then you either have to waste the food by replacing it with smellier food, or just leave it sitting around. I think I just need to try with food he enjoys more, but I wanted the point to be that he would eat his regular food from this toy."
3,Quite the workout - but maybe a bit too difficult,"Length:: 2:01 MinsThis video shows Taxi (soft coated wheaten terrier) opening and playing with his Christmas/10th Birthday present... a Tug-a-Jug. He's played with it a few times now and he still doesn't get that he needs to pull the cord to get the treats to come out -- although he really enjoys knocking it around until the treats accidentally fall out. I bought the large size after reading the reviews because of the cord. The large size had the plastic cord which is easier to clean. The smaller size has the rope cord. Taxi is not a big chewer, so I felt comfortable that this toy would durable - and it is. I filled it with stinky treats which he can smell through both ends... but those treats upset his tummy a bit, so I'm going to have to try something else. I couldn't find the ingredients of the treats that are sold with the Tug-a-Jug, so I didn't buy those."
2,Did not work for us,"We ordered the medium/large tug jug. It smelled like plastic so strongly my dog would not go near it no matter what food we put in it. I tried it with a friends dog four times and the dog could not connect that kibble came out when he let go. All he wanted to do was tug. The rope was so stiff he couldn't really get a grip on it and the rope also smelled of chemicals. Between the BPA in the bottle and cap and the inflexible rope, we found it was unusable and sent it back."
3,Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug,"Pretty cool idea. Lab loved it for a while...then it broke when it got tossed onto the driveway - bye, bye, toy!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DOG AND HE TOOK ONE LOOK AT IT PLAYED WITH IT FOR A FEW MINUTES AND NEVER LOOKED AT IT AGAIN- IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.. IT DID NOT INTERESTED HIM AT ALL.. SO DISAPPOINTED...
4,Fun Little Toy,"My Boston Terrier really loved this toy. With treats inside, it honestly kept him busy for about an hour as he tried to figure out how to get them. Unfortunately, the rope, which was his favorite part of the Tug-a-Jug, was pretty much shredded after only a few days of play, and without it he's mostly lost interest in the toy. But, if your dog isn't an intense chewer, this toy should be able to last quite a while, and keep them intrigued."
1,Plastic Lid Breaks Easily,My 7 month old Rottweiler broke the bottom lid off within a few minutes. The plastic is hard and when he tossed the product around by the rope it hit the ground and broke. Now he just plays with the rope.
1,Too fragile...,"Too fragile for my pup. He bit right through the rubber ""rope."" I think it lasted about 45 minutes. Granted he is an adolescent AmStaf, but I still had higher hopes. We are sticking to our Kongs (filled with low sodium chicken broth and frozen overnight)."
4,"Cool toy, too bad my dog is too stupid","Oh I mean, I love my dog. A lot. But he is FAR too dumb to figure this out. He instead just whacks me in the knee with it until I pull the rope out and bring some treats out.Hmm...maybe he's not the dumb one.It's definitely challenging. Frustrates my dog more than entertains him and is pretty formidable when connecting with sensitive kneecap tissue."
1,poor quality !!!!,This is a poor excuse for a dog toy . It lasted all of ten minutes . My puppy picked it up carried it across the room and dropped it on the floor and the screw off bottom that you load the treats in shattered and rendered it useless.Big waste of money !!!!Potentially a choking hazard if the puppy had chewed the broken pieces:{It deserves no star !
1,not durable for a chewer,My golden doodle chewed through the rope within 2 days. I thought it was going to be a great interactive toy for him but it was not. Clever boy chewed through the rope so that the treats poured out! lol
1,Waste of money and time,"Worst toy ever!-cheap plastic, not strong-rope too thick prevents treats to fall outI have a super smart border collie and he got frustrated with that thing. Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it. The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck. Which makes it a very expensive useless toy, I could have just use a small empty water bottle for no cost!!DO NOT RECOMMEND!Try the kibble nibble instead, I have one and it's way better even if sometimes the treats fall out of it too easily.Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Food and Treat Activity Ball"
1,"Clever Idea, BUT ....","The ""rope"" idea doesn't really work ( well it works 1 time). It actually impedes the dispensing of the treats after your dog yanks it out - now the treats are stuck inside until the human pushes the rope back in.Would NOT purchase again!"
2,Good while it lasted ... but it didn't last!,"I started feeding my chocolate lab his dinner in this toy and it worked well. I really enjoyed watching him figure out how to dump this kibble out and he seemed to enjoying the challenge of getting every last piece out. He took to picking up the empty jug and dropping it, as if to ask for more food ... and after 3 or 4 instances of this, the lid broke.If the lid were better protected from this type of damage I would definitely buy another one. It's not dog proof enough for us."
1,Doesnt work.,I have 2 chihuahua's and they are not at all interested in this toy. I have tried different types of treats in it and they still care less. Maybe it is a good toy for big dogs in a yard or something?
2,Too smelly? Dog won't touch it.,"Despite several washings, I can not get rid of the industrial plastic smell on the soft rubber parts of this toy, and our dog (lab mix) has absolutley no interest in it, despite favorite treats inside. I can only assume she finds the smell offensive/repellant.If she does ever take an interest in it (I keep trying), I will keep a close eye on the rubber ""rope""- seems like something she may chew through fairly quickly."
2,Don't understand the problem,"My one year old boxer is a big goofy, playful dog. He adores chewing on water bottles, stuffed toys, milk bones, you name it. I really thought this toy would be a terrific idea for him but he is absolutely terrified of it. He growls and barks at it, won't even smell it. Sounds terrific to me but I guess if you're considering this toy you should probably bring your pup to a pet store to introduce him to it first."
1,not good,my dog wouldn't even touch it. However from what I've heard other people use it. It seems way too heavy and bulky for a dog to play with and I can see if causing a lot of damage to your furniture if your dog was to swing this around. Especially if you have a small child that could get whipped in the head with it.
2,Expected more...,"I bought this for my Puggle (Pug/Beagle mix) because he loves to chew on empty soda bottles. The bottle part is very tough, but he had the rope part destroyed within an hour. I expected more from it than that. Without the rope, it's just not the same. I consider this to have been a waste of money."
1,Three Dogs...No want...,"I bought this tug toy because of the reviews...However, none of my three dogs had any interest in them, even when I put their favorite snacks in them. I dog is a big chewer, one is a medium chewer, and one is too old to chew! Not one would go near it...Also, it does not look like the picture. It is entirely in purple, and the tug is all purple and rubber... This is the only toy I ever bought that all three dogs disliked. It has been a week, and I keep giving them the toys, but no luck. I personally think it is too awkward and heavy..Fell on my bare foot, and it hurt somewhat. I think you could make this with a plastic soda bottle, for nothing...Sorry for the bad review....The review is from the dogs, and not me! I paid quite a bit for 2 of them, and Ineed to figure out what to do with them...paid too much to throw them away.. maybe make a bird feeder?"
1,My dog hates it,"I cannot get my dog to use this no matter how hard I try. My dog is the most food motivated dog I've ever known. She will do ANYTHING for carrots, lettuce, ice cubes... even her own kibble. But regardless of what I put in this thing, I cannot get her interested in this toy to save either of our lives. I even tried clicker training her on it! She doesn't associate it with food no matter what I do."
3,Lab loved this but broke it very quickly,"My 60-lb 13-month-old Labrador LOVED this toy but she cracked the top, effectively ruining it, within a few days. I'm not sure what size we had but I'm thinking it must have been the middle size (small?) - it was a good size for her insofar as she was able to fit the whole thing in her and tilt it on its side to let treats out but that's also how she cracked it. I'm going to get the biggest size, which I think will be able to withstand her, but I'm also predicting that she won't like it as much if she can't fit it in her mouth. Too bad they don't make this same toy with a rubber coating."
3,OK toy,"I thought the large would be too big for my Corgi's, but they seem to manage with it just fine. I did not notice that it comes in different sizes. My dog figured out how to get the treats out pretty quickly though. I also have the StarMark bob-a-lot and that seems to take them a little longer to get at the treats. You can adjust the hole sizes on the bob-a-lot."
2,Not Durable,The item was delivered here in great condition. My 5 month old American Eskimo likes the tug a jug even without any treats or kibble inside. But after a few uses a small piece of the bottom lid chipped off. My puppy didn't even play roughly with it. It could have been dangerous if he ate it. Luckily I was there.
3,Not Strong Enough,"I purchased this toy based on the recommendation from Dr. Ian Dunbar inBefore and After Getting Your Puppy: The Positive Approach to Raising a Happy, Healthy, and Well-Behaved Dogand it was fantastic for about two weeks.The toy was banged up against the wall and table a few times in the normal course of play and the plastic screw-top shattered.My border collie puppy still will play with it now even though it's missing pieces and doesn't hold food anymore. This is great, but it's pretty much become an expensive rope toy.I wish I had known before purchasing that it was so delicate. A much sturdier food dispensing toy has been theKibble Nibble Original, 7"" tall x 6"" diawhich has rubber bumpers that prevent the same shattering that happened to the tug-a-jug."
3,ok,The shipping was very fast. The product is super durable. It did not hold my dogs interest for to long. I am going to try a better treat and see if that works a little better. I say give it a try as long as its on sale.
3,"Dog loved it, but it broke after only 1 week!","I was initially surprised how big the toy was (small), but my dog (12 lb Terrier mix) ended up loving it anyways. I feed him his meals between various puzzle toys and it does wonders for his destructive tendencies. I was upset when it broke after only one week. I have mostly carpet with minimal tile floor, so not sure if he got rough with it on the hard surfaces. I tried taping the bottom shut after I fill it with food, but eventually the screw part totally fell apart and I had to throw it away. Not sure I will buy another one at this price. :("
2,Not For A Strong Chewer,We bought the large one for our dog thinking it was a neat idea to keep him occupied (and it is a really good idea for a toy) but apparently our 20lb dog has jaws of steel because the plastic broke the first time he played with it. He's not not a monster dog by any means but this just couldn't hold up to my dog.
1,too big,"I ordered the medium, which is actually a medium/large and it is too big for my Scottie. I found after receiving this from Amazon that Petco suggests the small size for dogs the size of beagles, cockers, and shelties. I think Scotties would fit in that category. He doesn't show much interest in the toy even with treats in it. I'll get the small and see if that makes a difference."
2,"Clever idea, but...","The rope is made of rubber, and after about 30 minutes my little 20 lb. terrier had chewed up the rope, thereby eliminating the ""tug"" part of the toy. I wouldn't be surprised if she ingested some of it. For $10, this toy needs a more durable rope."
3,Can be noisy,"Our dog likes this toy which we had gotten hastily at a drugstore when we realized we left her toys at home while on vacation. We fill this with Zukes or with crushed Nuturo choice snacks and leave it for her when we go to work. This can be a really long toy for your dog due to the small opening near the rope and it's good to check that what you put in will actually come out. Our dog gets her treats out be picking this up by the rope and then flinging it across the room (much to the chargin of the tenants below our apartment). She also just chews on the rope when she is bored and also tries to tug the rope back and forth in order to dislodge some of the treats. The best method for her however is to throw it and although it's durable, your wood floors may not like it and it can be somewhat noisy. But for this price, your dog will get a relatively long lasting treat dispenser that you can manipulate in order to increase or decrease the difficulty of earning their treat."
3,"Love This Product, But...","I have counted, and (no joke), have, over the past 4 years, purchased 18 of these Busy Buddy Toys. This is good (because obviously we love them), but, find that, after about a month, we need to order a new one, because my dogs jaws are so strong that, he breaks the toy. We eventually needed to stop buying the toy :("
2,Lids break easily,"Dogs loved it but, 3 out of 3 I purchased had the lids crack and break in a number of weeks. They need to use a different plastic."
5,Fantastic for energetic big pups,"My 70 lb Shepard/boxer mix absolutely loves her tug-a-jug. It takes her about 20-30 mintues to finish a cup's worth of kibbles. She's had it for about 5 months, and has yet to get tired of it. Also it's really held up well."
4,"It keeps him occupied, but annoying to hear","My dog Cooper enjoys this toy as much as he loves his Kong toys. He still hasn't figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him occupied for a couple of hours as he tries to figure out how to get it. Most of the time he chews on the rope. He has a strong bite and so far the rope is still holding on strong -- this is also why I bought him the medium/large. I felt that if I got him a small he'd chew the rope right off.The only con is that the toy is a little big for him to carry sometimes, and I didn't realize that the plastic bottle was going to be as hard as it is so it makes loud annoying sounds when it drops on the tile and hard wood when he tries to carry it on top of the sofa or bed. So other than the loud banging noises, I'd say this is a good toy. Highly recommend if you have carpet."
4,"Great toy, but NOISY!","My dogs love this toy, but they throw it around so much that the noise on my hardwood floors drives me nuts! We save it for special occasions now."
2,Buried Treasure Forever!,"The idea is basically a good one, however, my large Papillon (all 20 lbs of her) could not figure this one out-no matter how hard she tried. Food is a HUGE motivate her but unless I helped her, eventually she would just carry this toy around and just give up. I will say that the Tug-A-Jug had ME trained!"
5,Great Entertainment,My 1 year old Border Collie absolutely loves it! It's hard to keep him entertained and this tug-a-jug worked like a charm. I was also amazed that he wasn't able to destroy it....always a plus in my book. [...]. I would recommend to any owner looking for entertainment for their dog.
5,Great Way to Entertain Your Dog,"Our Jack Russell is a real chow hound and just `wolves' down her food. We now serve Wendy all her dinners in the Tug-a-Jug. At first she was quite frustrated but we mixed some small kibble with the regular size and she was rewarded enough to keep working on it. Now we simply toss in a couple handfuls of kibble screw the top back on and dinner lasts 15-20 minutes instead of the 2 minute bowl feast. Some reviewers didn't like the plastic rope in this newer version, but I find it cleans up easier and does not become frayed."
1,Great idea but too hard in practice!,"My dog is very smart, he got the idea of what he needed to do real quickly but it's just to hard for the treats to come out of the jar, even when we help him... the rope pretty much closes the jar hole and the treats wont come out. This toy made my puppy real nervous and unfortunately I'm returning it, even though I was super excited about it! :("
2,Only good if dog is food motivated,"I bought this to keep my Japanese Spitz occupied, no good. I don't know if it's too difficult for her or if she's just not interested in working that hard for food. She's good for a few minutes then gives up even though she'll get food from it."
3,My dog ignored it,My 14 month old Border Collie wanted nothing to do with this toy... so I gave it to my freinds 12 month old Lab ...and he also ignored it.. so now it just sits there... I cant even give it away :0(
2,Not really interested,"Our two dogs are not really interested in this toy, it has pretty much sat in their toy box since we bought it for them. Not sure why, they seem to like most toys. It is very durable from what I can tell though."
2,"Good concept, poor execution","Dog: 10 month old Lab/ GSD mix who's an aggressive chewerGood:conceptBad:-LOUD toy, keep in mind your dog has to drop this thing to get the treats to pop out and it is made of hard plastic-NOT durable. Tug insert (plastic) broke off after about a week (should have used a rope here). I may do this myself but I'm still debating if I want to hear this thing get dropped over & over & over & over again..."
2,"TUG PULL IS THIN CHEAP RUBBER, NOT A ROPE LIKE PICTURE SHOWS.",My puppy chewed through the rubber tug pull within a few mins.Not worth the money.
2,I thought it was stronger,My 3 month old Jack Russell Terrier totally love it... but it last for an hour or so. Look on the customer pictures to see what i mean.
3,Should be labled medium size dogs,My golden just picks up the bottle and dumps everything out. Larger dogs should use to big one that they can't get their mouth around.
3,"Well made, but only for the very food motivated","I bought the Tug Jug for my dog because she was jealous of the cat's Slim Kitty food dispenser and she likes to play with rope toys. I guess jealousy and rope are not enough motivation for her to play with it. They need to be very food motivated because it is very challenging to get the treats out, and unfortunately she isn't a big eater. It is a very sturdy and well made toy, and it is not as easy for them to get the food out as the other treat dispensing toys that roll around. She only shows interest in it if I play with it with her. I could see how it would be a great toy for the very food motivated dog who has a lot of dexterity. Also a funny side note, the package came to me opened by the post office already because apparently on x-ray in looks like something dangerous. Someone thought that a person would buy a molotov cocktail on Amazon, I guess."
3,Hard to interest my pooch.,"I have a 16lb Dachsund and we have a very hard time finding toys that she is interested in. We adopted her, and her home before us was as a breeder at a puppy mill where they kept her in a crate her whole life. So long story short, she has no idea what to do with toys and really, I'm out of ideas. She gets interested at first, but has a really hard time manuevering the bottle to get the treats out (she has had back surgery to repair paralysis in her hind end from ruptured discs so is not super agile). Also I think my little wiener has a little trouble figuring it out and I'm not sure how else to show her. I do like to toy and it has withstood her frustrations but I think I need more help with it. Some helpful hints or instructions would be greatly appreciated."
3,great idea but...,"I was dissapointed in this one. The only way to get the treats out is to tug it on the ground but the rope encourages the dog to carry it around, throw it around etc... You have to fill it up to get the treats to come out and sorry but I don't want to give my dog 2 days worth of food. Maybe I would have been better off buying the smaller one."
4,Entertaining,"My dogs love this toy. But make sure you don't leave them alone, I found out that the rope is easily chewed up, but also easily fixable. My dogs love to attempt to get the treats."
5,So much fun!,"My little dog enjoys this toy quite a lot. He hasn't quite figured out how the treats come out yet, but he's always happy when they do! LOL!"
3,eat-a-rope,"My 10-month pitbull loves this, but she chewed through the rope on this toy within her third day of having it. That's a pretty short life for $14 so for those of you who have had the same thing happened here's what I did: forget the rope and put a tennis ball or two inside with kibble. It's not exactly a tug jug anymore, but it does take a little work to get the food out."
5,Awesome Toy!,"I fill this toy with cereal to keep my high maintenance Lab occupied for hours! He's become very proficient at extracting pieces from the toy, but it still is a challenge for him. Fabulous indestructible toy. Great investment for my money!"
5,Hours of fun!,"My dachshund dog, Barney, ABSOLUTEY LOVES THIS TOY. He loves for us to put dog food kibble in it, and then he entertains himself for hours. He is very crafty in that he knows exactly how to get the cookies out of the jug. He rolls it until he can get it against a solid surface and then he flips it upside down and gets the cookies out. This toy is great, because I have two dogs, and they usually are always fighting to share toys, but the other dachshund, Cooper, doesn't like this toy, so Barney can have it all to himself. Strongly recommend this toy!"
2,Not Interested,My dogs love to chase pop bottles so I thought they would love these so much I ordered one for each of them. They don't even look at them. One figured out how to get the treats out but still isn't interested.
2,Not for every dog,"I have 2 Corgis, and also foster for Corgi Rescue. So far none of the four dogs I have had since buying this toy (my 2 plus 2 rescues) have played with it for more than a few minutes. They are all otherwise high energy, playful, food driven dogs.They LOVE Tricky Treat, Buster Cube and MolecuBall so I thought this would be a nice change. Big expensive yawn. I gave it two stars only because it appears well made. I bought it almost a year ago, and kept it around in case one of the foster Corgis might like it, but so far nothing. It is currently in the donate to the animal shelter box."
2,Not as pictured...,"The picture shown does not match the item I received. I specifically ordered this product because it showed the jug to have a plastic rope and not an actual rope (my dog loves to tear apart ropes, and I'd had a tug-a-jug that had the plastic rope previously and that was a great product. I'm not sure if they're making it with the plastic rope anymore, but I assumed that since that was what was shown, that's what I'd receive.) I'm not really happy with this bait and switch because I have to closely monitor my dog with this toy to make sure she doesn't shred the rope and render it useless."
2,Doggie No Likey,"I thought that this would be the perfect toy for my 100 lb lab who destroys Kongs in about 3 days. But, to my surprise, he was interested in it for all of about 5 min. He chewed the rope part for a little bit but has not touched it since."
2,Destroyed in a day and a half,"I bought this for my very smart lab mix rescue when she was about 6 months old. At first she wasn't interested, but once I showed her how it worked, she got down to business. She worked at that toy all day long the first day, thougth she wasn't able to get all the food out. On the second day I gave her the toy, partially filled with kibble and went upstairs. In the 25 minutes she was unsupervised, she got the screw cap off, ate all the kibble, and destroyed the bottle."
4,Husker Approved!,"Was surprised to read some folks lost this to their power chewers. Our Brittany, Husker, is a MegaChewer and has been loving this thing for months. It shows no signs of wear and tear, even after he carries it around several times a day. Our Golden Retriever, Gennie, will follow him around and help with ""clean up"", so she loves it, too!Why not five stars? It's a bit difficult for those with grip problems to load the kibble/treats in the bottle and keep it from falling out. Would make more sense if the part that screwed off was at the end with the hole/rope/spikey-rubbery thingey."
4,Great purchase!,Was reccommended by the Vet and ordered it right away. Dog loves it and keeps her busy for hours.
3,Not bad but could've been better,"It's a good concept, but the rope part of the tug a jug is not as durable as I thought. My Corgi/Australian Shepherd puppy cleanly separated the rope into 2 pieces so now it's just a jug."
3,Not exactly self serve,"There are 2 design issues with this toy: 1. in order for the rope to go back in, it needs to be PUSHED back in - this is difficult for a dog to accomplish without human help as it is not a stiff rope, but a flexible one. 2. When the dog pulls on the rope, it lifts the bottle up into an upright position, and when it's vertical the treats don't come out.My dog quickly figured out that the best way for the toy to ""work"" was if I set it up and let him pull the rope out while I held the bottle horizontal. So my dreams of independent play have not yet been realized."
3,Rope was chewed in one day.,"Our pit mix loves to chew especially when bored. We bought this thinking it was cheap enough and it might last a week. He chewed through the rope within a day. He loves the purple bottle though and carries it around the yard, sometimes trying to chew through that but he has not been successful. We have been looking for maybe some kind of thick rope from a ship or something, maybe then this toy would work for our boy."
4,Very good toy! Wish it was a little harder to get the food out though.,"This is by far the best doggy toy I have ever bought. I wish it was a little harder to get the food out. My dog Bailey is a master at pulling the rope stopper in and out to get out the little bits. I tried putting in bigger dog treats, but they are too big. Smaller dog food slides out pretty easily if Bailey gives the jar a whack. He can get all the food out in under 15 minutes. I need a puzzle toy that is more difficult so he can be distracted for hours. If the puzzle toy is too difficult, he usually just gives up.But it's an awesome toy because it makes your dog think a lot and keeps them distracted, because lord knows that if puppies aren't distracted, they are going to want to play with you!"
3,"Good idea, one major design flaw for us","We just bought this toy, and it is definetly something our dog loves and is interested in for a good period of time. It took her less than 20 minutes to figure out she just had to chew through the rope. If they could do a second version with a rope made of Kevlar or a metal chain with knots -that would be much better!"
2,Nothing special,"This product seems to be torturous for my dog. She sees the treats inside, but being such a small dog, even the ""small"" sized bottle is too big for her to thrash around and get the treats out. I love how busy it keeps her, but in the end, I have to take a treat or two out for her because she can't do it on her own. Probably better for bigger dogs."
2,Good idea... my dogs are not interested.,"I don't know. Maybe I'm just not putting the right ""yummy goodness"" inside. This toy, though durable and a novel idea, doesn't hold either of my dogs' interest. Not even our beagle (who tells everyone she's STARVING and we NEVER feed her... EVER!) seems to be interested in this for any length of time."
4,Worth a try!,"3 dogs, 1 loves it and uses it as intended. The only complaint there is that he's become far too good at it and learned how to push the rope in and out very quickly. He 48 lbs, gets his regular meals in it and finishes in about 15 minutes. I wish it took him longer but it sure is awesome watching him be so good at it! Worked great for the second dog for a few weeks, he wasn't as good at it, so it took him a bit longer to empty it so we thought it might be perfect for him. We were wrong, he chewed the rope in half one day. :-( Third dog is just kind of dumb and just smells it and looks at it. The plastic is really rugged though, they're able to toss it around on stained concrete floors without breaking it!Overall, I LOVE this company's toys. One of my dogs chewed a Kong but hasn't been able to destroy Premier's Squirrel toy. Dumb dog likes the Twist 'n' Treat, it doesn't take very much brain power..."
2,Nice toy but our Vizsla puppy is just not interested,"Another love it or hate it toy.... It's a bottle, it's a spiky ball, it's a rope, it's a treat dispenser! Apparently, the choices are too overwhelming for our Vizsla puppy because she passes this one up. In addition, the hard plastic bottle makes a racket on our hard kitchen floor, so maybe it's a blessing after all :)"
1,???,"My dog can't seem to figure this one out. No matter how much he tugs on it, the food doesn't come out. We prefer the Kong Wobbler. This was a waste of our money."
2,Plastic Is Not Durable Enough for a Dog Toy,"My dog really likes this toy, and it occupies him for quite a while. The big problem is that the plastic cracks at the top where the lid screws on if it dropped on the floor. My dog is Jack Russell, so he's not dropping it from a very high height, yet it still breaks, so I can't imagine it with a larger dog. We have returned this toy twice, and already the third on is pretty much unusable."
2,"Good concept, brittle plastic","I bought this toy for my 9 month old lab and had to return this twice. My dog loved it, but he dropping it on our hardwood floors and the bottom twist off part broke with each one. Good concept but plastic too brittle. Company does stand behind it, just not good for my dog."
2,Dogs not interested,"My dog are so uninterested in this that it might as well be invisible. I even put liver treats in it and tried to show them how to play with it. Neither dog would bother with it at all. (One is Female 4 yr old greyhound/lab/shephard mix, other is female 4 month old lab/border collie mix - both are very playful & love treats)Very disappointed."
1,Not good at all,"I have a yorkie (4 lbs) so I got the extra small one. Not a single doggie-bite-size treat could come out from where it supposed to, and that was me trying to get the treats out...So, don't bother with this toy, your dog is only gonna drool all over from smelling that toy."
1,did not work out,"It seemed like it would be a good idea, but my dog could not get the treats out. She is tiny and the extra small was way too big for her. I like the IQ ball way better."
2,Huckleberry tested and found wanting,"Huckleberry had an earlier version of this toy that he loved but it had a plastic insert to restrict the flow of food outward. Huck graciously gave that to a Mellow Mastiff named Buddy for his trip to his new home in Maine. When I ordered this new one, it came with a cloth rope as the insert. Huckleberry made quick work of that obstacle to the free flow of food. The idea is a good one and it was better implemented in its earlier version but this one is found wanting by both Huckleberry and me."
2,Rope too big,"I originally had the small size because my dogs are 25 lbs. each, but their mouths could not go around and pick up the plastic jug from the bottom (which they are supposed to do so they can shake the kibble out). I returned the small one, and order the extra small, and even though the opening for kibble was smaller, the rope was not. Even when I broke up the kibble it can not get around the rope. I was going to return it, but was in the middle of a move, so now I'm stuck with it, and it never gets used. I suppose if I can somehow untie the rope, unbraid it, remove a section, rebraid it, and retie it, it may work...but as you can see that sounds like an awful lot of work, for something that should have been designed better from the start."
1,Dog loses interest,The design of this dog toy is such that it is too difficult for my lab to get the treats out and she loses interest in even trying. Would not recommend this one.
2,Rope Frays= Choking Hazard,"My 4 month old boxer is a strong/ active chewer and bought this because of the popularity and good reviews. The rope frayed within 2 days of him using it for a total of 1 hour. My trainer said this was the older version and the rope on the newer version is made out of plastic. She said that the frayed rope was a choking hazard. Had to return it, even though he loved it."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my dog because I thought it would challenge them. It's hard for them to get the treats out because it has to tip at the same time they pull the rope,all they do is bring it to me all day so I can get the treats out for them."
3,Too heavy,I have a large dog but the 'bottle' is too heavy for tossing up by the cord. My dog seems to think it is too much work.
3,Rope is weak,"Lab enjoys the toy--now. When the rope was attached to it, he couldn't get the treats out at all and we were using TINY treats. He destroyed the rope in a few minutes and now the treats fall out."
3,Rope does not last long,"I have a 10 month old golden retriever and this product, while I liked the bottom opening for easy loading of food/treats (some toys dont even have that), the rope is not very long lasting for a heavy chewer. It only lasted < 24 hours before the strands got unraveled and i had to cut it off. Now i'm just using the bottle itself as a food/treat dispenser, which is just like a Kong Wobbler. My dog, after just 2 days with it, has already figured out how to get the food out as quickly as possible - by grabbing the bottom of the bottom with his mouth and lifting it upside down. Putting large treats or pingpong balls inside will help make it more challenging."
2,Frustrated Dog,"Great idea, but my fido is so frustrated he lays there and crying and barking hoping the treats will fall out. Still working on training him, but not sure this is good for his psyche. He'd much rather unscrew the bottom if he could."
3,Engaging but broke easily,Dog enjoyed playing with toy but the plastic bottle broke fairly quickly from being smacked around. Engaging but not durable.
2,Brain vs. Brawn,"So I am the proud owner of an almost 80-lb. 1-year-old lab mix whose sole mission in life is to seek and destroy. I have been looking for toys that would hold his interest longer than the 5 minutes it takes him to rip them to pieces, and saw this at my local pet store, but in the small size. I was thrilled to see the larger size on Amazon, and ordered it. This is a toy for smart dogs, and, of course, I like to think my dog is smart. However, he may be too smart. Gave it to my dog tonight. It was interesting to watch him try to figure out how to get the treats out, and he seemed occupied. I walked away to leave him to his work. 10 minutes later, he had chewed through the rope coming out of the top of the bottle. He cheated. This had potential to be an awesome, time-consuming toy to same some of my sanity. Unfortunately, if you have a strong chewer, or a dog who can figure out the short cuts, save your money."
3,Cool toy...but not for aggressive chewers,"I got this toy for my Border Collies and they had one really good play session with it before they tore it up. The bottle itself survived, but the rest of it was ruined, so you couldn't use it as a treat dispenser which was the point. I was hoping it would keep them busy/entertained. I think it would be okay for dogs that aren't as aggressive though. My dogs can tear up pretty much anything though! lol"
3,"Great fun, but not very durable","This is a great toy that my dog loved, but it didn't last very long. She likes to whip her toys around, and knocked this on something, and the container cracked. Also, the new style of toy has a nylon ""flossy"" style rope that is difficult to clean--man, that thing got smelly fast from kibble & doggy drool!Overall, great concept, but I wouldn't recommend if your dog is rough with their toys..."
1,Awful! Didn't make it through a day!,"Length:: 0:19 MinsIt took my dog no more than 4 hours to destroy this. First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with - we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one. Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon).First, my dog took to chewing the jug. She saw the treats and would hit at the jug. She also chewed on the grip and bone. In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it. She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her. Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL. In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all. She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix."
1,Weak,"My dog chewed the rope in half first, then chewed off the spiky ball. Finally then he got to some treats. He doesn't have patience for many toys and this one did not keep his interest. I was not impressed with it. One of the worst toys i have bought."
4,"very good album, but not the best one","Although a first class performer and one of the best jazz singer alive, Dee Dee Bridgewater should stay away from the great french evergreens. If one still remembers the immortal versions of Edith Piaf and other famous singers, this cd is a nonsense. I was therefore not going to attend her live performance in Trieste, my home town, but I fortunately changed my mind. Bridgewater is such a wonderful performer that all the cd's faults seemed to disappear. But on stage she left much more space for the wonderful musicians that back her: alas, they do not have enough performing time on the cd."
4,First Class !,"I saw Dee Dee Bridgewater for the first time at the Montreal Jazz Festival this past July. Her talent, energy, and her apparent love for what she does were most evident. This CD reflects all of these attributes. Her musicians are exceptional, as are the French versions of familiar standards. I highly recommend !"
4,Good fun family film,"If you liked Old Yeller then you will probably like this film, with Old Yeller being a little better in my opinion. Don't want to give too much away but it is about a boy and his dog trying to learn how to become a good bird dog. Well acted with many familiar faces. Moves along crisply, has comedy and drama. Well worth a look."
3,Not Bad!!!,"This movie was okay. The cover of the movie is very misleading, because it's about another dog. Some kids train a dog they call Moreover to be a bird-dog. They enter in a contest. Will they win? You gotta check out THE BISCUIT EATER!!!"
2,"excellent movie, but terrible DVD conversion.","First, this DVD is clearly a translation from video, not film. There is no widescreen option. When playing on a high-resolution monitor or television, the scanlines are very noticeable. To top it off though, there are frequently visible artifacts in the movie, which are especially annoying when fading in and out of scenes. In fact, the volume name of the DVD is even misspelled - ""BISQUIT_EATER""! I'm really surprised that Disney let this kind of shoddy work make it to market. It must have been a real fly-by-night translation service that they used."
1,Not the original,"I actually ordered this DVD not aware it was only a remake of the 1940 movie in black and white that was a lasting memory I had as a young child. In trying to rekindle those memories,I watched about twenty minutes of this version before turning it off. Because the original had left such an indelible memory, I did'nt need to see anymore to know I made a mistake in getting this one. The original starred Billy Lee and Cordell Hickman as the two young boys and I believe it may have even been voted the best piture of 1940. Easily worthy of five stars. This version may still appeal to other people but if they were to see the original I'm sure they'd agree as there's no comparison."
5,top of the line,"it's a classic animal movie, a tear jerker, but one that families ought to enjoy together at least once in their lives."
3,Satirical Songs for those whom do and don't like to think,Good Satire and enjoyable beats but don't think the whole album is like the two super hits SUPERMODLE and I KISSE A GIRL.
4,Real Good Stuff-Just not Diana's Best..Which came Later,"First things first.Diana is incapable of releasing anything not top drawer. This is among her jazziest,with some sly bass lines and sax playing swinging right along.""Is you..my baby"" cuts a rug very nicely, as do most of the others, and the much neglected ""Folks on the Hill"" is another mellow smooth one. My main gripe is there's just nine cuts here, even if they're all just about at Diana's customary high quality...The one surefire wonder of Ms. Krall is WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES, I believe among the finest pop/jazz albums ever recorded. Her other efforts are essentials too, and hopefully she will keep swinging and cooing for a long time to come."
5,excelent camera,"just as advertised, very small, very useful, great video, great photos, just what I neededthis is the second JVC camera I own and both satisfy my needs."
1,Agree with poor CS,"I agree with the people complaining about the poor CS policy at JVC. They let me down as well, when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built.I am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid JVC in the future. I just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit. This will come back and bite them in the behind."
4,good to have around,"the house for all those precious memories. simple enough to use and enjoy your home movies, with enough features to not feel too cheesy."
2,JVC DOESN'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS,"Bought this camera in Walmart. Used it MAYBE three times and the sound went out after 2 months. By that time, the store warranty had lapsed so they wouldn't exchange it and told me to call JVC. JVC wanted $65 just to look at it!!!!Luckily, my mother in law worked at another location and had her friends at the store exchange it for another one."
5,Genius from intolerance,"The history documentaries of Michael Wood are well received and with good reason. He has the ability to provide deep insights into the topic he pursues rather than just the old grade-school date recitation approach to history. That deep analysis gives us a sense of being investigative reporters seeking the truth in the historical events. This is history that finds the human element that shapes history. This approach is especially well suited to biography. Through the places and religious/political tensions of his time, Wood helps us better understand Shakespeare and his genius. An entertaining and inspiring story of a man formed by a conscience suppressed by the Elizabethan police state. For more on the religious persecution and the effect it had on Shakespeare's work, see alsoQuest For Shakespeare. For more depth on the English reformation as it relates to art, seeThe Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, 1400-1580."
4,Concrete documentation,"In Search of Shakespeare is very good in that it gives the viewer an understanding of the historic circumstances in which Shakespeare lived, both in the religious and political realms but also in the material sense. Much good use is made of viewing actual documents, although at times the ""now we're going into this house and we find this person who is willing to show us this historic parchment"" is getting a bit stagey and repetitious."
2,Still hoping it works...,"I really want this to work because I want an alternative to the propane-driven units tyhat seem to fail shortly after the warranty runs out. (Our experience with 3 of them so far.)But I have also seen more moths, june bugs, etc. than mosquitos being captured by mine. After three weeks I noticed the fan stopped qorking and I found a june bug jamming it. I had to take it apart to clean it out.Since I was swarmed by mosquitos wile fixing it I'm hopeful that they are now being sucked in! I'll try it for a few more weeks before giving up.We bought it somewhere with a no questions 1-year return policy and we're glad for that. Interesting that that place has now stopped selling it..."
2,Deceptive Title,"The title of this DVD is totally deceptive. The content has very little to do with UFO landings and a countdown to alien invasion.Most of the content comes from what appears to be community TV programmes, and whilst obviously amateur in production values, the interviews are quite interesting with subjects ranging from the star child skull, to crop circles, to what really happened during the Apollo `moon landings', to UFO sightings.Admittedly the music video and the Michael Jackson nutters are quite irrelevant, but on the whole the DVD was of interest. It's a pity it is misrepresented by its sensationalist title."
5,exceptional,A rare program for the historic Gewandhaus. One of a kind DVD. I delayed picking this one up--I shouldn't have--it's now one of a very few prized DVD performances. Don't pass GO--do not collect $200---get this DVD.
4,Original version of Symphony Less Pleasing,"This DVD introduced me to the first (1840, premiere) version of Mendelssohn's Second Symphony (Lobegesang), one of my top 5 classical music compositions.Although the performances on this DVD were first rate, I did not like this original version of my favorite composer's Second Symphony, ""The Hymn of Praise"".My favorites amongst recorded versions of Mendelssohn's familiar, 1841 revised Second Symphony, the Symphony-Cantata, are by Chailly (LPO, Philips, 1979), Sawallisch (BPO, EMI, 1988), Weller (Philharmonia, Chandos, 2004), Masur (Gewandhausorchester, BMG Eurodisc, 1990) and Karajan (BPO, DG Polydor, 1973).This DVD is my only unfortunate purchase from Amazon."
5,"Very nice. Holds its ""curve"" when worn with pendants.","One problem I always have with pendants is that they tend to weigh down the chain into a ""V"" and then get stuck on a link and slip to one side or the other. This chain is thick and stiff enough to keep your pendants hanging straight. The stiffness also compliments more modern jewelry designs."
1,can you say roll over and play dead?,This is a lesson on how to just give up and die. Don't try to help yourself or your family because THEY will still get you in the end.There is no reason to plan ahead because THEY want everyone to be doomed in the end. Equally miserable is the lesson taught.
4,Great magnification,"This mirror is really nice to help see those really hard to see things on your face. It makes plucking hairs real easy and helps you prevent gooky eye syndrome. It is a nice size for a purse or pocket. The only thing I may complain about is that at times the suction cups don't stick for very long. Unless that is a problem with the things I stick it to. Maybe it sticks better when things are excessively clean. Would definately recommend this product, especially if you have some trouble seeing things such as dirt or spludge on your face that need to be remove."
4,Great for bathroom,"This is great for the bathroom since it has suction cups. I put mine on the non-magnifying side of an accordion extension mirror that I can pull away from the wall, close enough to my face to use the magnification of this spot mirror with no distortion. Just be careful, the last one I had popped off and broke when I flipped the extension mirror around to quickly. I would recommend re-wetting the suction cups periodically to be sure that doesn't happen as it can occur when they are dry."
1,Keyword Spaming,"I didn't read the full product description this is catnip not the catnip treats they list in the title, shame on them"
2,Not your typical Follett.,"Do not buy this book unless you are totally bored and can find nothing else to do. For such a great writer, this is a disappointment."
2,Disappointed Customer,"When I received this book, I was sad and shocked to see the condition that it was in. It was labeled as ""very good"" when I bought it, but when I opened the package, very good was not what I was thinking. The cover was a mess, some of the pages had random highlighting on them, etc. Overall, I was very dissatisfied with this sale."
2,not what I was looking for,"I really liked that this product had so many natural ingredients. I was looking for a body wash or soap that smelled like gardenias, but most of the items I have found have sls in them. This one does not, but nor does it really smell like gardenias. That may be a one of the scents but not a dominant one of this body wash. Which makes the name of the wash misleading, at least to me. I will not be ordering it again. And after 3 or 4 uses, I will put this in the very back of my bath shelf."
5,Surprisingly Great,botton line - very impressed with all the tracks - my favorites are - I Never Cry and Dead Flowers - I hope they do those on the tour this summer
1,Can't write so they cover...that's pathetic,Covers only.How embarrassing.They should have retired 15 years ago.
2,Poison'd is right,"4 out of 13 songs is about all that's good, the rest stink. If you're gonna do a covers album, stay true to the original's. Abysmal or not, Def Leppard's ""Yeah"" album blows this thing out of the water. My wife who's been a poison fan since day one wasn't even impressed if that tell's you anything. Maybe Poison needs to stick to covering their own song's."
1,These guys owe me 15$,"I rarely buy CDs anymore with downloads so easy, but as a Poison fan I had to have their newest tracks in my hand. Brett, CC, Bobby and Ricky Owe me 15 bucks for this obvious self indulgent load. Can it be These guys really have nothing left to say at all."
1,Can you ever beat the original? Not this time,"I've always been told if I have nothing good to say about something, then don't say anything at all. So, here is my review of these covers: ...."
2,Bad Covers,"I guess it is good that Poison's all original songs are far better than their covers, but at the same time I've heard several local bands that do covers better than Poison, so I'm not sure what that means."
4,Great Party Disc,"OK, there's nothing of consequence here, but really, did you expect profundity from Poison? Of course not. You wanted nothing but a good time, and this CD will certainly provide that. The covers are fun, Bret Michaels still sounds really good, and this is a great CD to keep in the car or pop in the player when your friends are over. I especially loved the cover of Sweet's ""Little Willy"" -- that one will get a lot of play on my iPod."
1,Put some effort in!!,"To me, this is just laziness. Poison are talented as their first 5 albums were great and matured nicely. The recent releases, Hollyweird, more greatest hits and this one are a real disapointment to me. Even some of these tracks have appeared on previous releases.I've followed these guys for years but feel it's time they stop resting on their laurels and put some effort in to produce the quality they are capable of (that is their own stuff too)."
4,Good bang for your buck,"Five movies (and counting...) based on a song? This chapter focuses more on the bad deeds of the 'Wild Bunch' (as in Butch and Sundance) in the Wild West. Kenny Rogers has a very personal interest in the gang's activity which is not brought to light until near the end. Loni Anderson plays a madam at a house that includes Mariska Hargitay as one of the girls who also helps the Wild Bunch on their heists because the Pinkertons never expect a lady to be involved. Dixie Carter makes a brief appearance as a popular singer. There are a couple of good laughs and the story rolls right along, there is a heist on a train and a hanging. I do not usually like westerns, but I liked this movie (and got it in a Wal-mart bargain bin for less than half of Amazon's price)."
5,"Yeah, more ice cream","The Ice cream maker is fun to use and we wanted to do more than one batch at a time as it only makes 1 1/2 quarts max so not much if having a gathering. Having a second bowl ready in the freezer will be great, and the Amazon price was well under what it was on the Cuisinart website! Welcome summer BBQs with homemade ice cream! Also works well making wine slush in such a short time."
5,Cuisinart 1 1/2 Quart Ice Cream Maker Bowl ICE-45,"Good price, you don't have to freeze it overnight. 10-12 hours is fine.Bought this bowl as a 2nd back up when making ice cream."
4,Approaches to Social Research,"The book was in good condition, and the description given by the seller was accurate (minor highlighting, etc). Good price too."
5,Sky's the limit,"The most under rated singer songwriter of the 90s hands down. If you're into Nick Drake, Townes Van Zandt, Willis Alan Ramsey, Jackson C Frank, Leonard Cohen et al you won't be dissappointed. It's dark, smoky, and at takes me to places that I didn't know existed."
1,This is sad.,"Hunt just doesn't get it. Filled with historical inaccuracies, logical fallacies and just downright bad exegesis Hunt shows the world what I always suspected; he should have stayed in accounting. I have nothing but pity for him."
1,The worst book ever,"I read this book about 5 years ago and I was appalled at the complete illogical thinking. I will read it again at the reqest of my dad but I will say that Dave Hunt does ask the correct question - What love is this? Arminians need to answer what kind of love is it when there is an omnipotent God who chooses not use His omni attributes to bring someone to salvation? What are the components of love found in the Bible? Compassion, Mercy, Chastening are the components of love. If God loves He will have compassion, mercy, and He will Chasten. God will prove His love with these components by using all His resources. If a man dies and is damned to Hell for eternity then What Kind of Love is it for an omnipotent God to allow it?"
1,Good to keep warm,I'd give this book negative stars if I could. This one is a good one to throw in the fire place. That's all I have to say..
1,ENMITY AGAINST GOD,"SINFUL MEN HATE A GOD WHO IS SOVERIGN AND FREE. IT DENIES THEIR SUPREME CLAIM TO BE MASTERS OF THEIR DESTINY. CALVINISM IS THE TRUTH. THIS CAM BE SHOWN IN TWO WAYS. HAS MR. HUNT EVER PRAYED FOR GOD TO SAVE SOMEONE WHO DID NOT WANT TO BE SAVED? SECOND,DOES GOD ONLY CHOOSE THOSE HE FORESEES WILL WILL BELIEVE IN CHRIST? OBVIOUSLY NO CHOICE ON HIS PART.PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY HE WOULD NOT FORESEE THEIR FINAL DESTINY IN HEAVEN OR HELL AT THE SAME INSTANT. SO IS HE GOING TO CHOOSE TO TAKE THEM THERE TWICE. YOU CAN BE SURE NO ANSWER WILL BE FORTHCOMING. TAKE HEART CALVINISTS. WE WIN IN THE END."
1,Timewaster,"This book is not worth reading. It would be much better to read some B.B. Warfield. For instance, ""The Saviour of the World"" is an excellent book."
1,Hunt's downfall,"This work is fiilled with miss-quotes, historical inaccuracies and outright lies. A very sad testimony to Dave Hunt (lack of) integrity as an (christian) author, Should rather be titled Dave Hunt's missrepresentation of Calvinism (& historic Chritianity). dm"
4,Nice study on an important issue,"Dave Hunt does an excellent job of research on Calvin, Augustine. Well worth it! He's tackled something that I've been in the dark about along time."
1,What Kind of Argument Is This???!,"I gave this book 1 star because that is the lowest offered. This book does not present a case for anything, at least not in the traditional sense of the term. Hunt asserts, emotionally manipulates, misrepresents, and does anything except actually deal with issues and wrestle with Scripture...."
1,dangerous book,"Oh brother. American Christianity has become so weak that they can't even admit that God is greater than they profess. Regardless of the ""detailed research"" and all the big-named reviewers of this book, it will not influence my Reformed faith. Nothing will. I've been on the other side and have finally come to the truth. In a world that places man higher than he ought to be, you could expect that there would be humanist teaching like this in the ""Church"". God is bigger than all of you and does choose as He wishes. The interesting point is not that only a few are chosen but that any of us sinners is chosen at all. God is gracious, and I'm thankful He's chosen me."
3,What Love is this?,I order this book for one of my brothers. He read the book and said that he could not agree with some of the things he read. He would not recommend the book.
1,"Poor, sloppy scholarship from someone who fails to understand Calvinism","This book, while written with passion, fails to truly understand Calvinism. Straw-man arguments are used frequently, lightweight exegesis abounds, and the frequent practice of proof-texting is astonishing. The Calvinism-Arminianism debate is very important; those interested in reading what Calvinists actually say would be well advised to look elsewhere."
4,The Book Reports the Truth,"God's sovereignty includes free will. God wills man to have free will. So how can there be more sovereignty and less free will when God willed free will to man within the bounds of His sovereignty? Jesus Christ said, and this cannot be refuted, that His Father wills not one of His little ones to be lost. And the voice of God through Ezekiel stated, ""Do I have any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?...turn from your wicked ways and live!"" If God predestined some to hell, why would He indicate that they could turn from their wicked ways and live. Calvin is wrong. R. Coleman, ThD."
1,Dave Hunt's Misrepresentation of God,"Dave's new book was intended to point out the errors of Calvin and his theology. In reading Hunt's book I am convinced more than ever of the Calvinist position. All Hunt does in this book is destroy his ""moderate calvinism"" which is really not Calvinism at all, Hunt is an Arminian. I hope that there will soon be a book to come out from the reformed position to respond to Hunt's book, such as Geisler's Chosen but Free, and then James White coming along and destroying CBF. I think a better title of the book should be ""God's Love: Dave Hunt's misrepresentation and misconception of God and Calvin; That title is much more true to the book itself."
1,Poor Theology--Poor Education,"Hunt's theology in his book is about as clever as his education. Hunt hasn't even attended seminary. In his book, Hunt shows poor exegesis and does not let scripture intepret scripture. The only good reviews of his books have been given by Arminians, like Hunt, such as Chuck Smith and Tim LaHaye( who hasn't attened seminary either, but received a honorary doctorate degree). Hunt should not even be called a ""moderate Calvinist"" because to attach Calvin's name to Hunt's theology is a poor example of Calvinism at all. If Hunt is honest with himself, and uses scripture and scripture alone, he too will one day become a Calvinist. Sola Scriptura! Sola Fide! Soli Deo Gloria!"
1,Dave Hunt's Latest Loser,"I'm not sure why it is that writers like Dave Hunt are so disinclined to master the source material needed to really investigate the subjects they take on. Maybe because their arguments would fall away like the fluff they are. It's one thing to pontificate about how ""unscriptural"" calvinism is, and quite another to mount a ""scriptural"" refutation of it. Calvin's ""Institutes"" start and finish with scripture references on EVERY page. Hunt has to rely on faulty historical data gleaned from the usual dispensational non-sources. As wrong headed as REAL works against Calvinism (Like Fletcher's ""Checks to Antinomianism"") are, at least they TRY to use scripture properly. Hunt is just embarassing, but then, who expected more?"
1,"Misleading, False History, and Slander","This text relies heavily upon tainted history, a lack of understanding of reformed theology, and logical fallacies. It is by far the worst theological work I have read in several years. In addition to Hunt's complete lack of understanding of reformed theology he also slanders the character of John Calvin, completely ignoring the political and economic climate of 16th century Geneva.I would suggest that serious students of truth do their own independent study of Calvin, Geneva, and reformed theology.Let us seek out the truth, not the rantings of a man who has an agenda."
2,What Love Is This? by Dave Hunt,"A faulty analysis of Calvinism by an intelligent man who should know better. He fails to deal with a plethora of Scriptural verses which clearly run counter to his viewpoint. A few parries are made against straw men. His treatment of the ""perseverance of the saints"" is simply a parable, but no hard evidence is adduced to build any solid case. A few good penetrating questions are posed, but some are stunningly just as incriminating of the ""quasi-Arminian"" view (Hunt does not actually claim to be an Arminian), such as the repeated rhetorical, but vain, offering (paraphrased), ""Why would a loving God fail to save billions if He could save them all?"" Certainly an interesting read, but easily refuted. Disclosure: I'm a Calvinist."
1,Inadequate,"The book displays a lack of scholarship, and Hunt's penchant for half truths and insinuation comes through.Better research and attention to fact would help."
1,A Tome for man-centered theology,"This is one of the worst books on theology ever written: historically innaccurate, theologically inept...etc. I'm sure that those on the ""Free Will Whosoever"" side will love it...fine. If they want their man-centered, cross denying, heretical theology, they may have it. Only those who have not studied God's Word at all will delight in this book. I would like to recommend my book, GOD CHOSE TO SAVE as a direct rebuke (and a simple one at that) of Hunt's tripe. As Spurgeon once said, Calvinism is just a short hand for the Gospel."
1,My stomach was eating itself from the inside out.,"I never made it past the second chapter. By that time, Hunt had already claimed that Spurgeon denied limited atonement and claimed that John Bunyan was not a Calvinist. Now, if you can call a man who said that ""Calvinism is the Gospel"" non-Calvinist, and a man who unapologetically embraced not just Calvinism, but good old, supralapsarian 'high-Calvinism,' then how in the world can I trust your interpretations of Scripture? Anyone who wants to understand the subject, read ""Why I am not a Calvinist"" for the Arminian view, and then read ""The Justification of God"" or ""The Pleasures of God"" or ""The Doctrines of Grace."" These are much better books and are not the polemical, ad-hominem riddled mess found in this book.I only gave it a star because the review thing made me, plus the cover picture was kind of cool."
5,"I'm no ""scholar"" - and very thankful for this book...","I came in to this book with a bias against Calvinism, based on my reading of the Bible, sound Biblical teaching, and my own ""real world"" experiences. Something about Calvinist teaching, when I heard it, just did not ""square"" with reality.Now, with the help of this book, I see clearly that the bias was justified. In fact I see how Calvinist teaching had crept in to my thinking in certain areas - and kept me from being clear-minded about what the Bible says and how it relates to our lives.I strongly recommend this book!"
3,Not dark enough,It's good but you have to put a lot on to make it look black. If it was a darker color than I would get that instead
2,Love and Awakening,"Although this book might help some people, I did not like the conversation format. The subjects seemed to take on a whiny tone and used ""psychobabble"" such as ""I fell into myself"" and ""He isn't in his heart"". I could not read this without thinking about a 70's group therapy session due to the lingo."
4,I love the nightlife,"In this episode of Jeeves and Wooster, Jeeves steps out of his usual detached role and volunteers to live the nightlife to the full. This is not by choice, but because a friend of Bertie's is in trouble.Rocky is a reclusive poet living off his monthly allowance from his aunt, but auntie wants the boy to write her letters telling of all the wonderful activities that go on after dark in the Big Apple. Desperate to stay out of sight, he begs Jeeves to go on the town for him and write a report which will be forwarded on to his aunt. This backfires (of course) with hilarious results in the usual Wodehouse tradition.My favorite scene in this episode is when Jeeves joins Bertie for a duet on the piano."
2,Taschen Buyers Beware,"As owner of a number of fine Taschen books, I am sorry to report that this volume is an almost complete disappointment. One finds erotica from primarily 3-4 sources: an anonymous book and several collections. While the plates have Taschen's standard quality, the limited perspective of these few artists fails to deliver anything resembling a true overview of erotica in the 20th century (something obviously very much implied in the title). In the same fashion, with such a limit on content, the brief text fails to do the same. While one may applaud the preservation of these works and the fact that Taschen has made them available to all at a more than reasonable price, anyone expecting to find a full or even reasonable overview will be sorely disappointed. I found this book to be a low-tide watermark among Taschen publications and the only book of theirs that I own that I actually regret purchasing."
1,Dirty pictures by any other name,This series is supposedly a study of erotica through the ages. It is nothing more than a compliation of dirty pictures. Save your money. If you want dirty pictures...there are better books. If you want something that seriously explores erotica over the past couple hundred years this is NOT the place to look. Boring.
4,"Another typical ""new school"" album from the 90s","If you're a fan of Mc Kid Frost, especially his older stuff, you'll like this album. This isn't the style ALT was using when he guest starred on Frost's album ""Smile Now, Die later,"" it's a light hearted ""new school"" era album through and through. There's not one inch of gangsta on this whole album. The beats are funky and fun, and the lyrics are full of lightweight puns and jokes. If you liked the 90s stuff, or you're just a fan of Latino rappers, this is a good album. Have an open mind when you listen to it though, especially if you're into hardcore stuff mainly, the only thing hard about this album is the case it comes in."
2,Beware of the software,"This is a wonderful camera. I purchased it and took it on my long-planned trip through Europe in 2006. Upon return, I downloaded the pictures using the Cyberlink Power Producer software. I worked on the pictures, then saved them until I had time to return and finish my sorting, renaming, etc.When I returned, the pictures were missing. I found a file with the correct extension, but the software wouldn't open it. In spite of several attempts to get Cyberlink to resolve the problem, we were unsuccessful. Their suggestions for resolving the problem were short-sighted and repetitive. I even paid Data Doctors privately to try to find the file. Cyberlink finally admitted there was nothing else they could do.JVC didn't even bother to write back."
1,JVC Does Not Stand Behind Their Products - JVC Lemoncorder,"I agree with the many other users who have experienced the ""Condensation, Operation Paused"" defect on their JVC GR-whatever. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs."
4,Very Nice,"I like the camcorder for video. It is very easy to use and takes a nice quality video. For pictures, however, not as good. Unless you can stand perfectly still the pictures tend to be a bit blurred."
2,Good Camera Poor Battery Life,This is a good camera. It has served well since I bought it a month ago. The only thing is that battery does not last more than 40 minutes when fully charged and there is no warranty on the battery. Mine is dead after one month. That is kind of disappointing. I had a Sony DCR-SR40. It had two hours battery life. JVC customer is not good like Sony or Canon.
4,Even the cave man can do it,"This camera is very easy to use, takes just minutes to get going. Good value for the money, but still pictures are a joke, sound quality and settings could be better and transferring clips from camera to PC is from 80s. Excellent picture quality in this price class in normal conditions, but will take a bit more practise to learn different settings e.g. for bright back light or reflecting light. Buy an extra battery if you decide to go with this JVC."
5,Best thing in video since sliced bread,"This unit has a very user friendly interface and is very easy to figure out for the average consumer. I work in the motion picture industry as a cameraman, so I do have a unique perspective. It does take a while to figure out the software and the the best way to download the video, but once you get it, it's as good as apple pie. The one downside is this unit's operating temperature. It gets very hot the longer it's powered. But that's the price you have to pay with a hard drive camcorder this small. Even with the state of the art Professional High Definition cameras in the motion picture industry, you still have over heating issues as well as power consumption issues. Eventually this will be solved, but for now, this is as good as it gets."
4,It is also a great snap shot camera,Going to a HDD camcorder from a miniDV camcorder was like going from a film camera to a digital camers. The camera will also record directly to SD memory cards. (about 50+ minutes of normal quality video on a 2GB card)I would recommend getting an extra battery and external charger. I paid about $42 for a 1400mah battery and charger. having short battery run time and built in charger is just plain stupid on the part of JVC. If you aren't willing to pay for an external charger and extra battery you are going to be missing out on a lot of video shots.
3,"Great design, questionable quality...","I like the Design of this blanket, but we've had it for less then a year and it is starting to fade already. I've been washing it in cold water to prevent some of the fading, but this didn't help. Also some of the stitching is starting to come loose. For the price, the quality should be better; But it has been a cute addition to my daughter's ""Sea themed"" bedroom."
4,Pretty but thin,"The comforter is very pretty and seems to be well made, but it is very thin. I had not noticed that in the picture before I bought it."
5,Astrid Varnay is phenomenal!,I have a copy on long playing record format--Excerpts on Deutsch Grammophon 136030. I wouol be especially interested when available again on CD.
5,Wonderful author,Every Living Thing is another great novel by the beloved James Herriot. I have all of his works and have read them over and over. No other modern author is as enjoyable to read as James Herriot.
2,Extremely poor OCR job,"This ebook is full of spelling mistakes. The mistakes are all of the kind which pop up during a poor scanning job. I've quite some editing experience (in more than one language) under my belt, and have never seen such shoddy work. Examples ""farmer"" spelled ""fanner,"" ""the"" spelled ""die"", etc. It seems a English dictionary was not present to aid in character recognition. None of my free (i.e. non-copyrighted) books are have such a plethora of scanning errors. Mind you, the print editions are close to flawless (I gave mine away, i.e. had read it several times before). Amazon should withdraw the Kindle book and upload a corrected version."
1,Bum CDs,"Make sure to try out any audio books you get as soon as you receive them. I bought this book for my son for Christmas. He didn't get around to listening to it until February, and found every single CD in the set is marred. Now it's too late to return it. It was a lot of money for a useless book! Bummer!"
5,Fabulous Sailing Photographs,"This is a wonderful book for all sailors---armchair or blue water. This large-format book is packed with wonderful, beautiful photos from the great days of the America's Cup races. The photos of the J Class boats are just stupendous."
5,Incredibly fast and pretty long lasting,"I am immediately 2 - 3 miles per hour faster with these tires! I ride in a city and they have held up gradation, no cuts or anything. They handle great and - have I said this before - they are extremely fast tires. You can't beat the price for what you get."
5,very uplifting and stress relieving !,"Our family enjoys listening to Sally Harmon so much and this particular CD is one of our favorites. Our 17 year old son uses her music as a model for his own style of piano playing. The CD ""In The Garden"" is the music we prefer for Sunday afternoons at home with our family."
3,Not exactly what I expected.,I thought I was getting piano solo music and was disappointed there were so many other instruments. I felt it was elementary music rather than the flowy musical music I have heard her play before.
5,MY KIDS LOVE THIS BOOK,"I bought this book when I was in highschool to save for my children some day. Sixteen years and five children later it is worn thin. I just purchased another used copy (but in better condition)so that my youngest will get to grow up with this amazing story. The story line centers around Wiggy Pig and his birthday party. It counts the guests as they arrive by listing the current number of guests at the top of the page, and illustration below that includes many other items that correspond to the number. The story is told in rhyme which verbally counts the guests. Below the text is another counting opportunity with a picture of each guest that has already arrived. This list grows from page to page as does the fun in this story."
5,Glorious Book,"This book is informative, beautiful and a delightful read. Plus you can use it as a reference book! Give as a gift to your gardening friends and they will thank you!"
4,Creative and fun book!,A friend asked me to purchase this book for them so that they could read more about it. It was highly recommended by another one of our friends. We all will try to make flowers from this book then maybe order others.
3,The Edible Flower Garden (Edible Garden Series) by Rosalind Creasy,"I got this book as a gift for a family member. When I got the pkg. it look good on the outside... no rips, holes, cut nota. I opened it; this NEW book I purchase had a cut on the front cover. I was UNHAPPY & UPSET. But I keeped the book to give as my gift. Good thing I have an understanding family member.The book it self was a good book it was the condition when I opened the pgk."
2,World Jazz Gone Haywire,"Nice title. Nice packaging. That's about it for the positives. What's wrong here is what's wrong with a lot of American microbrews: Too many ingredients not properly integrated.I had high hopes for this disc with the wildly eclectic musicians on board--Antonio Hart and Ellery Eskelin bandmates?--including such oddballs as the remarkable Michel Godard and Tom Varner. But it just never jells. Instead of finding ways to get all these wonderful players contributing their own magic, they seem relegated to weak supporting roles, unable to cut loose, straitjacked, voiceless.There are plenty of better world jazz discs out there. I'd pass on this, if I were you."
2,Only a few of the episodes held any interest to me.,"I really only watched this show while I was doing other things because it just wasn't that interesti g, Unfortunately I cannot really give an intelligent review because I didn't pay it that much attention."
3,battery life so-so,"I bought this camera because it has a feature to manually set shutter speed and aperture, and that works great. And overall this camera is high quality and a good value.But battery life is too short, compared to competitors I have tried."
3,Average! Good value for money.,"This camera is a good value for money. But however I can only keep this as a second camera. The picture quality is not what you would expect from a Olympus or Canon. Several pictures I took blurred. Even the ones that came out good, when I compared them with similar pictures taken with Olympus and Cannon, I can clearly see the quality difference. Olympus and Canon both had a better quality, the pictures were sharper and clearer. So, please don't mind spending a little more to get a better camera, especially if you are planning a family vacation."
3,Impressive,"Very impressive for the time! I purchased this camera nearly 5 years ago and it was still going strong up until it was stolen from my house in early 2012. This is a very sable point and who camera with good quality images. Easy to use, and easy to upload. You can get cameras with better pixel rates and features on the market for sure, but this product is great for getting the job done. Definitely recommended as a starter digital camera, great for kids or teenagers."
2,Okay for pictures--HORRIBLE for battery life,"This was the first dig camera I have had that didn't use a rechargable battery. It simply devours batteries. I just read another review that was really helpful, advising not to use Alkaline batteries with the camera, but I read it too late. Now my camera won't work with any kind of batteries. The battery life got worse and worse (even with batteries right out of the package). And the WORST thing about this is when the battery gets low, the zoom lense freezes while open, so if you can't replace the batteries right away, your lense is completely unprotected. Such a shame, because it takes decent pictures. I'm replacing it with a Canon--with a RECHARGABLE battery!"
2,Great pictures but terrible battery life,"I bought this camera to use while hiking and otherwise away from a constant supply of batteries. If you buy this camera, you better bring huge supply of batteries with you. For instants, once in a while I would get maybe 20 or so photos before it shut down, sometimes only 3 or 4 and a couple times it would not start up with store fresh Duracells. It always seemed to shut down when I needed it the most.On the positive side the pictures look great, the camera has easy to use controls and the supplied Windows software works well. All in all I suggest you look elsewhere for a digital camera."
3,"decent camera, battery problems","This is a decent camera that usually takes good pictures, the only problems are short battery life and the fact that you can't take a stabilized shot without flash."
4,nice product and nice price,"The product is pretty well. Although it is just a low price digital camera, it has almost all functions which can be satisfied all families."
1,Steer Clear,This product is not reccommended. Within the first 8 pictures the battery was exhausted. Picture quality also left a lot to be desired. I would definitely suggest a different selection for a low to mid level solution for a digital camera.
4,Good Camera,Camera was in good shape. Slight problem with it but think it was just new batteries needed. Been working well since.
2,Eats Batteries,Fine Picturebut buy a rechargeable two AA 2500 mah battery setup it takes like ~30 pics before it needs a new set.
5,NICE CAMARA FOR A NICE PRICE,"Very nice product for a great prize, if you want to save a extra $$$ and get great pictures, this is your option..."
1,Can't afford to operate the camera,"I purchased the Samsung camera about 3 months ago thinking it would be a great camera to take along on my vacation to Alaska in August. Sure am glad I bought it early! I couldn't afford to buy batteries for this camera. On several occasions, I only got 6 pictures out of one set of batteries.I have an older digital, took the batteries out of the Samsung (It indicated they were dead) and used them in the other camera for 20 more pictures.I recently bought another camera to use on my trip, anyone want to buy a Samsung S730? Cheap!!!"
3,Synthesized heavy bass pumping,"The overall sound of this album reflects the producers, Bolland & Bolland's, heavy hitting bass presence. It is akin to much of Falco's songs/hits, which many of his hits/albums were also produce by Bolland & Bolland. As far as a contemporary group to compare the sound to, I would have to say this album has a heavy bass sound similar to the Backstreet Boys' single ""Everybody"", but the songs of course are more Sexual if you will. This album, while it isn't as good(substance wise) as any of Falco's works, it does possess a catchiness so that you will find yourself listening to it again and again."
4,Very enjoyable,"Bought this album a long time ago after seeing them open for Space (artist who sang ""Female Of The Species"") Haven't heard much about them since, until I looked them up on amazon and saw that there was another album out by Muse. I was rather disappointed when I found out it wasn't the same group (bands, when you think of names for your band, do some research and make sure that the name's not already taken), because really enjoyed this Muse in concert and the album as well."
3,hmmm,"well I seem to be rather unsure on this. I have read reviews saying that this is not by the same 'Muse' who put out the much loved 'Absolution', 'Origin Of Symmetry' and 'Showbiz', and in all honesty this seems highly believable. It certainly doesn't sound anything like Matt Bellamy. It seems a very good album nonetheless, for example, 'Star' sounds wonderful, but I would be highly grateful if anyone could give more information on the actual artists of this album. That way I, and many other curious customers, could be certain of what they are purchasing, and be completely satisfied as a result."
3,"Not bad, but the singer totally copies Billy Corgan...","This record is actually pretty good. But really, let's be honest here, the singer totally imitates the voice of Billy Corgan (form the Smashing Pumpkins). It's funny, because until now I had only known Muse's later albums, on which the singer copies... Thom Yorke!!! It's a little hard to take that band seriously really, even though they are talented."
5,"If you have any taste, buy this now.","Dungen are these 70's rocker's bastard prodginey. Raga-infused folk rock, psychedelic proto-metal and Swedish vocals. Rythm section reminiscent of Krautrock majesties Can. What else could be better?"
4,Good Quality for Price,"Good quality for its price. It lasts, but the only thing is that when the battery is low it immediately shuts off the Palm."
2,didn't work for me,"I purchased the item 3 years ago and tried to use for my Palm, but it didn't work for me. Current price is half for what I paid"
5,Try this CD,"Boy on a Dolphin transcends sterotypical genres. . . .'African roots with a spanish influence. . .' is an excerpt from their own publicity piece that aptly captured this CD. This band obviously has a lot of talent.Every one of my friends who are serious about music have purchased this CD after listening to my copy. The overwhelming favorite cut on the CD is ""Nouwe O N'Mazei"". A fun, fun get up and move number. Each cut is good I like ""I'll remember you"" and ""Are you lonely now"".In my collection, lyrically it would fit in with the Oyster Band, Midge Ure, and Richard Moody.Hey Boy on a Dolphin ""Where are you now?"""
4,Delightful musical,"Volga, Volga, Joseph Stalin's favorite movie one would think is a huge turn off. The film I must confess is a delightful escapist musical that even the most devout anti-communist can appreciate for its humor and music. Don't let the fact it is Stalin's favorite put you off. If you enjoy light-hearted musicals then watch ""Volga, Volga."""
1,The real E-DuBB review of Smili'n Faces,"All in all the album was tight, I just grabbed it to see who this clown was using my name.I was glad to see that the person using my name at least put out a solid c.d.I give you props on that, you get no love for the name though. If you ain't been E-DuBB since 92' you need to find a new spelling. That name spelled how you spell it holds alot of weight in the streets. Be careful.100DuBB[...]"
4,GREAT GIFT,BOUGHT AS A GIFT FOR DAUGHTER IN LAW. SHE LOVES IT. SEEMS TO BE AN EXCELLANT ENTRY LEVEL CAMCORDER. ENOUGH BELLS AND WHISTLES TO SATISFY MOST WITHOUT BEING EXCESSIVELY EXPENSIVE. QUALITY IS GOOD WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM JVC. OPERATION IS SIMPLE ENOUGH AND PICTURE QUALITY EVEN FOR JPEG INTERNET QUALITY STILLS IS SATISFACTORY.
4,Easy to Use,"The product is compact and portable, seems solid and well made. The zoom is good, and the functions are all fairly simple. Hooks up to a tv easily enough.The nigh vision feature, while providing better visibility, creates more of a strobing effect than I would have liked. Also, I have not yet figured out how to transfer video to a computer (I have the right cable), but I haven't tried too hard to figure it out."
1,Poor CS,Beware of poor CS policy at JVC. They recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built. They were not interested in even trying to help.I hate it when companies only care about their profits.
5,Amish Houses & Barns,"While the title of this book suggests the obvious--that it deals with the houses and barns of the Amish--there is much more to it. After a cursory discussion of Amish architectural preferences, the author focuses on three Amish farms to give the reader a better sense of how Amish farmsteads and farming practices have evolved. These accounts are, however, largely genealogical. Overall, the book is very enlightening and informative; it is written in a clear and refreshingly lucid manner, and contains numerous black & white photographs of homes, farm buildings and equipment--and, in some cases, livestock. Truly a pleasure to read."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY,"I paid over $27 including shipping for this DVD and was truely disappointed. The movie is in B&W showing only one dance that lasted less than 10 minutes. I did not learn anything nor get anything out of this DVD. It is truely a waste of time and money. Again, please do not buy this DVD and waste your money."
1,Money poorly spent,"I agree wholly with 'Big Lou'. I fault Amazon for not warning the customer that this DVD is only ten minutes long. That amounts to $2.70 per minute of viewing time. The overall experience was akin to watching a very brief amateur video of a 1960's sock hop. No introduction, no commentary, no useful information. A poor investment of $27.00."
4,why pay more,"if you're not a weight-weenie, this works great. why pay more for high-priced chains? The rest of these words are to fill up the minimum req. review length."
4,Good for the Amateur,"The first paragraph of the Preface is herein quoted:""This is a book about the behavior of light in crystals. Since it is written for people with no previous training in either the subject of crystals or the subject of light, the first six chapters tell what sort of thing a crystal is and the seventh tells about some of its physical properties. The remaining chapters describe some of the effects produced on light, mainly polarized light, by crystals and so constitute an introduction to optical crystallography.""My copy of several years ago came with a piece of polarizing film; don't know whether this is still included, if not one can order a sheet from Edmund Scientific catalog. This little book is clearly, lucidly written for the student and the amateur."
2,Dissapointing,This book doesn't tell me anything more than I already know. This book is more suited to marketers who are just starting out and need the fundamental basics to get them going.
2,...to be continued,"I really bought this CD for one song. After listening to it in it's entirety, I was a little disappointed in the groups lack of creativity in an era (early 90s) flourishing with ideals."
3,An OK CD from the golden days of Rap,"This album was ok.. I bought the cassette when I was 17 years old right after I heard their first and only hit single ""one on one"" on the radio, but was disappointed to see there were only 2 good songs on the album, ""one on one"" and ""can I get my flow on"". The rapping skills of all 3 were very simple and so,so they never really ""wowed!"" you with rhymes that were deep or metaphoric, but still compared to the rappers today they were Mozart. I still recommend buying this CD because ""One on one"" is worth the small price of the used CD alone. It's a great song thanks to a very smooth beat and very catchy hook which overshadows the mediocre rapping of the trio."
4,Encouragement for Dads,"As a speaker to parents, I encourage dads to read books and continue to improve their parenting skills. Spiritual Secrets of Faithful Fathers is a short booklet that may take an hour to read, but can help men build better relationships with their children that'll last a lifetime! It's positive and powerful and would make a nice Father's Day gift.Also see The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start"
3,OK - pops apart easily,The case is OK. It pops apart too easily for my taste and it makes accessing the controls a little difficult.
1,No Belt Clip,"Item did NOT have a belt clip, or any clip. That was the main reason I made the purchase. It is simply a cover - that would probably help prevent damage from dropping, etc. Without the clip it has no value to me."
3,poor quality,it's plastic..its a case it does what its supposed to do but the clip hardly stays up so it will make your mp3 player fall..and the case is very difficult to get off I will have to ask my husband for help to get this off since my hands are not strong enough. this was a waste of money and i will be opting out for a different case
3,For the money....,"Pros: cheap, should protect the player if dropped.Cons: I bought a case expecting a belt clip, and none was included. It's also fairly bulky.I guess I can't complain for the money. I'd return it, but it would probably cost more than I'd gain."
5,Great Gate!,We put this gate up to keep our daughter from going up the stairs. It is wonderful b/c it doesn't have holes in it for little feet to climb - it is very easy to use with one hand and so easy to clean!! We have them mounted on our wall so they swing open and are very easy to detach and take with us to use as a pressure mount when we go somewhere where they don't have a baby but do have stairs.
3,"nice gate, but 27 month old can climb it...","I was really excited about this gate due to its great reviews. It is a nice gate - I like that it is clear and it is really easy and fast to mount and un-mount onto walls. However, my 27 month old was able to climb over it as it has a little ledge where the white plastic meets the clear plastic...so if you have a climber like I do, I would go with another gate option..."
4,The perfect wall mounting gate,"I would definatley recommend this gate to anyone looking for a wall mounted swing gate. It is easy to use and blends in nicely.The only dissapointment I've had was after 1 week of use part of the wall mounting bracket just broke! I called The First Years company directly, I didn't have my receipt, they were VERY nice, and immediately sent out a replacement part and it's been fine for about a month.If I hadn't received such good service from The First Years, I would not have given this 4 stars.Even though I had some initial trouble I still love the gate!"
2,KEEPS Breaking-I Give Up,I love this gates design. Its Perfect for my litte monkeys who always manage to crawl over the other gates. I had my first one for 1 month then the little plastic piece under the handle broke. Not from misuse just using it daily. Got a replacement. Had it sitting upright leaning against the wall and it got knocked down. It broke again somthing inside was ratteling and it wouldnnt stay closed at all. I'm so disappointed. It would be perfect if it was durable so I returned it last night.
4,Great gate.....but......dogs did it in.,"I have had this gate for about two years. I'm here on Amazon deciding if I want to buy this gate again, or try something else. I have two dogs, a Min. Schnauzer and a Bichon who is a jumper and a digger....she has pushed and dug with her paws to the point where she can open the gate on her own now.....the pressure closure looses some presure as time goes on.The best part of this gate is it's clear, so it doesn't seem like a hideous gate....it's appealing and easy to use. I don't think a child would be nearly as rough on this gate as my dogs, so I recommend it!"
2,Didn't work for us.,"I had high hopes for this gate. We bought it to keep our son from reaching through the bars to tease our cat, but since our doorway has baseboards, he simply reached under it. While I appreciate the unique design, we found it wobbly and difficult to install tightly in the doorway when used as a pressure gate. Oh, and our son also figured out how to raise the latch the first day (he's 20 months). I'm returning it today."
1,Don't make the same mistake we did....,"We just got this installed and can't wait to take it down! We had to mount and paint additional hardware at the top of our stairs to accommodate it, making it less than easy to insall. Once up, (several hours due to poor directions) I was eager to swing it open. That part was easy. The challenging part is closing it. You have to line it up (top & bottom) just perfectly with the handle in the up positon in order to close it. This amounted to lining up the top positioner okay, but needed a foot to kick the bottom one into place. You can't just ""close it"" and walk away. I can't imagine doing so with an armful of laundry or my 9 month old in my arms. I'm heading out to buy a different type of gate today! It's only redeeming qualities are its esthetics."
3,Nice Gate but not easy to install,I bought this gate to use in a daycare and the instructions were not easy to understand and it was difficult to get a tight fit once mounted. I do like that it is clear and that the kids cant climb it but they need to improve the directions
2,Worked for a few months...,"We bought this gate for the top of our stairs. It was more difficult than expected to mount but once it was up it work well for the first few months. My brother and 16 yr old son have rooms in the basement and probably use the gate most. After about 3 months the gate was difficult to align which is required to get it to latch. The rubber feet on the latching side for the pressure mount started to tear off and now the bottom one won't retract when you pull the handle up so you have to kick it to get it in or out of the pressure mount cup on the wall. The gate was replaced with a metal walk thru gate last night, hope we have better luck with this one. We are keeping the gate to use in other doorways without the swing mount feature."
2,If you rent don't purchase this gate,"I purchased this gate for the bottom of my stair case to keep my dogs from going upstairs into my infant's room. I bought this gate because it has a pressure mounting system and a proper gate door. I need to be able to open the gate while carrying my baby, but I currently rent a home and I am not permitted to drill holes into the walls so the gate has to be pressure mounted. When we went to install the gate we realized the gate door only swings open if the gate is affixed to the wall using the hardware provided. When you use the pressure mounting feature the gate door does not swing open. It's a nice, well constructed gate, but I can't hop over the gate holding my baby every time I want to go upstairs. So if you rent your home and you can't use the mounting hardware, and you want to use the gate door feature, don't buy this gate."
2,Great at first...until a few uses later...,"My brother in-law bought one of these for his baby. I noticed that the screws were almost ripping out of the wall, I figured it was more than likely because he just drilled the screws into the sheet rock and didn't use the plastic sheetrock pieces that come for the screws. Well, I went ahead and bought it and installed it the right way. It's been 3 months since installation. The damn door never stays put in place, I constantly have to re-adjust it and the stupid screws are still coming off the wall, no matter what I do. I re-adjusted the door, screwed it into the wood this time, and now the door is still loose, never stays in place unless I force it into place. So...beware. Skip this if you can, get a metal door gate instead. Those are much better than this one."
2,lasted 1 year,Really liked this gate...while it lasted. We had it for about 1 year and then the internal mechanisms broke and we were not able to fix it. Bummer!
3,MUST Use Hardware!,This is a great gate if you use the hardware. DO NOT pressure mount this gate as it is absolutely ridiculous to operate and is not user-friendly at all. I'm baffled as to why they even created it as a possible pressure-mounting system.
2,Pain to open and shut,"The gate itself is sturdy, it's the opening and closing it that makes this gate bad. There are many different steps to opening the gate. This would not be a gate to use in a high traffic area. Not worth the money, I recommend the safety 1st gate which is a similar design."
4,Love this gate!!!!,"I own three of these gates and I love them! I have all of them mounted on the hardware as oppossed to just pressure mounting them. I have a very active 2 year-old boy. He will hang off of them, slam them open and close when he can, and just flat out bang on them. I love that I can see through them and I don't have to worry about my son sticking his arms through any bars. The only downside to this gate is that the clear plastic has gotten marks from my son banging his toys on it and it is very hard to remove some of them. Overall, I would recommmend this gate to anyone!"
1,Pressure mount did not work,We have a first years gate from the 90s and it still works well so when we needed an additional safety gate we chose this one. The pressure mount did not work for us at all and the clear window on the gate seems very flimsy. We returned it.
5,Brilliant solution for our climber!,"Went through several hand-me-down gates before purchasing this one. Couldn't be happier! Baby can't get a grip on it with his feet! It's also very simple to open and close one-handed, sometimes half-handed. We have ours mounted in a doorway and haven't tried the pressure mount feature. With our other pressure mount gates we were always irritated with how long it took us to get the gate in place, the wall mount on this one makes it a snap! Would recommend this to everyone and will be buying another one or two for grandma's house to replace some ones baby can easily climb up."
4,Handle Breaks easily,"I LOVE this gate I am however on my sixth one after my 4th child and running a daycare, because the children swing on it. Even as durable as it is MY husband insists on adjusting it too tightly which causes the handle to break off and then the gate is useless. The bonus is if you send the handle into the manufacturer, they will replace the gate. THis gate is by far (after instructions to all the adults, who say DUH) the BEst! IT is the most functional, asthetically pleasing and user friendly gate i have EVER had. I LOVE it and wouldn't be caught without one!"
3,Cheap mounting brackets,"I had one of these gates 3 years ago when my daughter was an infant and it worked great. Until, one day the latch inside the door broke and we couldn't use it anymore. By that time, she was old enough that we didn't need it any longer. I purchased another one recently because our 7 month old son is crawling everywhere. The first day it was up, the bottom part that screws into the wall broke and left a hole in the mounting bracket. My husband tried to repair the bottom and the top part broke in the same way the bottom did. Later he bought some longer screws and bypassed the orignal screw holes, which worked for a few days. My daughter (4 years) pushed open the gate today and the whole bottom mounting bracket split."
4,Very sturdy and easy to install,It has held up against our very active son's desire to explore it ... It is a fair price and seems like it will last long enough for future kids too.
2,"Attractive design, flimsy parts - would NOT use at top of stairs","We bought this gate from Babies R Us last month and installed it in our home as a hardware-mounted swing gate. After just a couple of weeks of use, the top plastic hinge snapped off from the wall, leaving only the two screws in the wall. I was surprised by how easily the part broke. We like the design so we have requested a replacement part from the company. Fortunately, we did not install at the top of our stairs - seeing how easily it snapped from the wall, I would not recommend installing the gate at the top of any stairs."
2,NOT FOR CLIMBERS,"I bought this gate so that my 18 month old could have room time, thinking that it would be impossible for him to climb. I only used it as a pressure-mounted gate and it was easy to put up. However, he managed to scale the side of it and was straddling the gate crying when I checked on him. To the gate's credit, it did not fall under the pressure of his weight, but it does not serve it's purpose - and is not safe - if he can climb it! I am returning it today!"
3,"Great gate, not right for our situation","We bought this gate to keep our toddler out of the bathroom during the day, and to limit her space to roam at night (just between her room and ours.) Anyway, this gate worked great in a doorway as a pressure mounted gate. Our trouble came when we went to use it in the hallway. The baseboards made it impossible to get tight. The gate is also heavy and this makes it hard to make the proper adjustments to get it tight when trying to use it above the baseboards. I think this gate would have been great if it were hardware mounted and used as a swing gate. This is an option for the gate, but not one that fit our needs. We wanted to move it around and use it in different places."
4,Love it!!,"We bought this gate a few weeks ago because I am 9 months pregnant and have a large chocolate lab that I do not want going into the baby room. However, I did not want the door to be shut all the time either. So we got this gate because I wanted something I could easily get in and out of without the hassle. This gate is great!! It was really easy to install and it looks great as well because of the clear sidings, it doesn't take away from the room at all. I also have a 2 1/2 year old stepdaughter who has not managed to get in or out of the gate, even with a little push. So I am fully confident that this gate will do the trick. I highly recommend.I only gave four stars because we haven't had the baby yet, but I do not anticipate it getting worse...only better!"
2,Great until it broke,"I bought this gate and had it harware mounted in my hall. It was easy to install and use, but the adjustment for the width broke in about 5 weeks. Its just 2 screws into chinsy plastic! If they fixed this little flaw it would be a great gate!"
1,Loses Tension & Then Useless as a Pressure Gate,"I bought 2 of these gates the same day. I liked this gate because it is more attractive than the other gates that I have seen. After about a week, one of the gates lost all tension on one side. I realized this after my son fell backwards when pulling on the gate. The store (babiesrus) would not take it back because I didn't have the receipt and didn't have the original box. So I am stuck with a wobbly gate. If I have to use it at all, it is as a deterrant only and I must keep an eye on my son. I would not buy this gate unless they fix the problem with the tension, because I see that I am not the only person who has experienced this."
3,good book in general,i use the book in my drafting class. this work book/text book serves its purpose. a little hard to be doing all those exercises since you have to flip the book back and forth just to do the print reading exercises (having the figure in one page would have been nice or on a separate book)but still a good book in general.
5,gift for other person,The book was a gift and was for learning asme y14.5-2009 at work place.am told it is very good. FRED
5,Absolutely a must have title!,"En excellent collection of the great songs from the movies we all like: Titanic, Anastasia, Hercules and many more! Sally Harmon makes them even better with her unique style, playing them in the best way we would like to hear. Professional original arrangements accompanied by bass and drums. Heart of The Movies in my opinion is the best album Sally have recorded until now. Most recommended!"
4,Magnificent read.....,"This book took longer to become involved in than the first book in The Galway Chronicles, but once involved could not put the book down. A wonderful historical fiction read, especially if you have any interest in the pre famine Ireland.From the intrigue of British spies, to murder, to spreading of smallpox, to amnesia, you will not be able to put this book down.You have to love Mad Molly Fahey. What a neat character to portray if this series would ever be made into a film.The characters remain basically the same as in the first book with a few notable additions. The most interesting being the Tinker.The ending of this book will quickly compell you to begin reading the next book in the series."
4,Good read,"The authors tell their stories well. If you've read one and enjoyed it, you'll probably welcome reading another. I liked it."
3,Not his best work,"After borrowing friends' LPs and tapes, this was the first Chris Rea CD I actually bought, based on previous enjoyment of his work. Unfortunately, I was not very pleased with his efforts here. I still think Dancing With Strangers is Rea's best album, both personally pleasing and commercially accessible.God's Great Banana Skin moves further into blues territory than previous albums and sacrifices the musical diversity that permeated Dancing With Strangers. The only song I really enjoyed on this album is Too Much Pride with its rockier beat and melodious backing vocals. Oddly enough, this song was not released as a single.The title track is a nice enough tune, the lyrics being typical of Rea's wry humor. Both 'Banana Skin and Miles is a Cigarette were repeated on the US edition of Rea's next album, Espresso Logic."
5,WOW,"Have been a fan of Chris since 1988,,,whew, where has the time gone? I was working and had teenagers, so now I am making up for lost time. Just when I think he can't surprise me amymore than he has,,he does. The CD is excellent and with the ""Too Much Pride"" song he just blows my mind. He IS God's gift to women. His throaty voice is a gold mine."
1,never received purchase,"Very upset to have paid for an item that has never been received. I had this album many years ago and loved it. Would have liked very much to reinstate this treasure to my collection. Very upset with not receiving it and cannot yet figure out how to report this to amazon, and wonder what sort of fraud is happening and has it happened to others."
1,Why is the Kindle Edition So Expensive?,"Let me begin by declaring that I have not purchased the Kindle edition of this book, nor do I own this book. I was a student at the Moustakas founded school, The Center for Humanistic Studies (before changing its name to the MiSPP), and used this book as the foundation of my research. This book has become a rare gem. It is very hard to find and probably out of print these days. The high price tag on the paperback edition are understandable for these reasons. What I do not understand, however, is charging almost the same amount for the Kindle edition! The book is seriously no thicker than a pencil! Finally, there is a method of getting this wonderful little text out to those who have found it hard to find or to afford, only to charge almost the exact same price as the rare paperback. I am glad I was given a Kindle as a present because I have barely noticed the advantage of having one."
5,A wonderful glimpse into life in another age.,"I love books that give details of life in the past from original sources, and that sums up this book. With lists of foods and their common and uncommon uses, A Handbook of Ango-Saxon Food is fascinating in itself, and invaluable to anyone writing in the Anglo Saxon period, or even in the early Norman. Jo Beverley, historical romance author."
1,A Must Buy for Jaguar Enthusiasts,"One of the best, if not the best, book on the Jaguar XK8/R series by a top expert on Jaguars. Great information if you own one, and you absolutely must buy this book if you are thinking about buying a used one. Also many good photos that I have not seen published elsewhere."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"This is a well done book. That aside, I was looking for something a little different. I was hoping for a list of places I could go in the United States for accessories as well as more technical information. It almost seems that when the author gets right up into the meat of the subject, he changes course and changes the topic, leaving me wanting the rest of the story. On the other hand, some of the repairs he describes are far beyond what I would attempt and should be done by a professional in my opinion. Although this book didn't contain what I was looking for, it did have a great amount of information. It would be particularly interesting if you live in Great Briton, as the author is English and his excerpts deal with mostly English themes. As an American I was just not that pleased with the book. I feel the book would have been more impressive to me if it had sold for about half as much."
2,Pésimo empastado,"Quedé muy decepcionado con esta compra, ya que aún cuando la calidad de la información que incluye el libro es muy buena, la calidad del empastado es pésima. Con solo un par de hojeadas, se desarmó y las hojas se soltaron. Lo que me generó la sensación de haber mal gastado mi dinero. Una verdadera lástima."
1,Umm not so good...,"I;m surprised at the high rated reviews this book received. I just could not get into the book took me two days just to get to chapter 6, at that point I'd had enough, returned the book back to the libary..thank god I didn't spend my money on this one."
5,Right on tyme,Rarely have I read a sequel that was better than the first book. This is one of those occasion when the author did her damn thing. I really like I was apart of this story. It made me wonder is P and Ant real people. I'm glad Asia was able to find her happiness after all. Keep up the good work.
5,Crystal....u just don't stop,"Didn't think that it could get any better than Hood Rich But, gurl u messed around and did the da** thang again and again I must say that I am very proud of u. Big Tymers was the stuffand was so real that one could just picture themself there.It had drama, suspense, humor Big Tymers is really a source of education for the young and the old. keeps us old folks on top of the game. Again thx. so much for blessing us with your talent. Ma Brown a.k.a. sharingmyblessings"
3,Nuns and hookers...,"Nuns and hookers -- the perfect combination for this silly TV comedy movie about Dixi, owner of a bordello who is convicted by a judge to be in the custody of Sister Eugenio and Sister Agnes at the convent. Of course, lifestyles clash and lessons are to learned by all before the sentence is up.The cast is good, and the DVD offers a few laughs in this escapist comedy."
3,Improve your stroking,"You figured all those dumb bikini movies from the 80's were not going to be made anymore. Well, you thought wrong. This one is made in the 90's and contains the same, useless plot, poor writing, lame comedy, and nudity."
3,Turn off your brain,"This is a movie you watch for the T&A.; Why did they bother with a story line? The antics of the Bill & Ted like golfers are the best parts, especially the tall skinny one. His energy and absurd behaviour make you wish the movie just followed them around until it was time to see Amy Baxter's(...), that's about every 10 minutes. Which is great!I would give Amy and the two golfing boneheads four and half stars. The rest of it is good for getting up and going to the fridge."
4,Golfballs!,"Funny, sexy movie. I'm a woman, and the movie was obviously made with men in mind, but I laughed out loud anyway. The character ""Shank"" was great, his lines were hysterical, and their delivery, superb."
2,You Get What You Pay For. . .,"This rug pad does not grip very well to my hardwood floor, so I decided to use carpet tacks in addition to the rug ""pad"".I would recommend spending more money and getting a thicker, better quality rug pad; since this pad does not offer a lot of cushioning."
3,Shrinking sheet,"I was disappointed when I washed the mattress cover and waffle liner for this basket before using it and the mattress cover shrank so much it now will not fit over the mattress--not even close, it's about half its former size. I used cold water and medium heat to dry. My baby may very well love it once the baby arrives (I will use the extra sheets I just ordered), but for the price I would think a washable mattress cover would not be too much to ask."
4,Cute story,"This is a super cute, non scary Halloween book. It follows some little kids as the get ready to go trick or treating. Some of the scratch stickers didn't have a very strong smell, but it didn't seem to bother my son. Great book at a great price."
1,not really all that helpful,"This book insults the intelligence of women. Do not buy if you want actual helpful information. Just talk to a guy friend to learn about ""their"" world."
4,"Not too shabby, but...","I found this on my girlfriend's coffee table and decided to read it. There is plenty of common sense info which will help both gals and GUYS!!!However, being a sports buff, there is an error in the baseball section for Babe Ruth. His lifetime batting average was .342; .690 was his lifetime slugging percentage."
1,Freedom in the Family A Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights,"I was very disappointed that the book I received did not include the 17 pictures that are to be included in the book. I am not sending the book back, because it includes some family members. Then, the company sent me a book that says Bound Galley- Not for sale. The name of the company is Ballatine Books, therefore I feel that I bought a counterfeit book. I know one of authors and will be emailing her concerning this."
3,A bit too fragile,"The glass looks great. But as I held it in my hand, and believe me please, gently dried the inside with a paper towel, the stem snapped in my fingers. I can't tell you just how little pressure was applied and now that's $60 bucks down the tubes after only 2 glasses of wine!"
4,Hard to clean without dish washer,"It is super delicate and takes a lot of finess to clean. You really need a microfiber cloth and a source of steam.I would suggest just to use the dish washer. If you don't have a dish washer, then don't buy it.Quality-wise, it's amazing. It's really fun to drink out of, and it make a nice sound when you cling it."
3,Beaded Critters,The book was good for what is was but it was not as I expected. It used wire not string.
1,"VERY chidish, not for an adult wanting impressive results","For the most part, I was SO shocked how poorly the finished items look. The CAT does not even look like a cat. 90% of the imagines I would not even waste my materials. The finished pieces look SO fragile, using one on a key chain or anything but a greeting card or in a scrapbook special effect would be foolish. I am so VERY disappointed. Of all books this one needed to show the inside pages so you KNEW what was really inside. Amazon needs to screen their entries better. I will be returning this one."
5,"A witty, lively and entertaining book, a blessing to read.","Very good stories; fairly light reading required; the stories are fully captivating and well constructed; everything about them is excellent, the characters, the interplay of events and the background scenery presentations.The book constructs the characters clearly, in a loving way, for each of the three stories in the book (I say three because the first two parts are almost separate stories but start and finish as one story) and the stories themselves are witty, lively and entertaining; you cannot put the book down once you start to read it! Each story is a witness for the Lord and a blessing to read. I thoroughly recommend this book."
4,"Good, but a little disturbing.","I rented this 2 weekago, when I got this box accidently instead of the live-action one. But I can say this:I wasn't COMMPLETLY dissappoited. This is actully a good cartoon. Just like the Heavy Metal series, there's plenty of gore, cursing, and nudity, to the point it's disturbing! It stays loyal to the comic, as in the characters are all drawn the same way, the plot's the same (unlike the live-action movie;but it's still good), and all the chracters' attitudes are the same. I believe it was directed by Todd McFarlane (creater), so you can see why. If it seems familar, you probably have amensia or have HBO, which this aired on for about a year or so.If you liked this, check out the other 2 Spawn movies, the live-action movie, and the Heavy Metal series."
2,Terrible writitng ruins a potentially good movie,"First of all, I've never read the comicsThis movie could have been good if it wasnt for the terrible writers and director. The animation was well done and so was the story, but the movie became muddied down by gratituous, needless violence and sex...not that I'm against that, but there is such a thing as goign overboard and this movie did that.The voice acting was well done also, espcieally with spawn himself.It's too bad..this movie had the potential to be great"
4,The new Noir for a world engulfed in Shadow,"McFarlane's first few issues of the comic series were inspired, but because of his novice status when it came to writing as well as drawing, not fully developed. In creating the series, he was able to create a more cohesive whole - a chapter in an epic that completes its own arc. The whole series is a terrifyingly good jaunt into the nature of redemption from the shadows of true evil. The animation isn't all that it could be, but the voice acting and sound effects, as well as the use of Dolby Surround, create a whole that bleeds beauty. Watch this in the dark and the volume up - alone, and check your cynicism at the door."
5,Cascade is Murphy's best yet; a musical triumph,"If you are a Peter Murphy fan, Cascade is an absolute must have. A more complex album than his others, Cascade takes you on a brilliant musical journey. From the urgent opener Mirror To My Woman's Mind to the hypnotic Subway to the guitar driven Disappearing to the lyrical follow up to 1990's Cuts You Up; The Scarlet Thing In You to the dreamy finale Cascade, this album will never leave your CD player after you hear it. The album is full of Murphy's trademark baritone vocals, hidden meanings, and wide ranging moods. Check out Cascade, you will not be disappointed."
3,The good cuts are some of his best,"The good songs, and there are 4, make the album worthwile for anyone, and a must if you like Deep."
4,twilight sounds,"Cascade is probably Peter Murphy's most solid solo effort. these songs effortlessly combine his hauntingly beautiful voice with a strong dreamy rock asthetic that reveals delicious bits of melody and just a slight tinge of that Turkish middle eastern feel that Mr. Murphy embraces. ""I'll Fall On Your Knife"" stands as one of his greatest songs in his catalogue. worth seeking out."
5,Peter Murphy's very best,This album stands as a materpiece of melodic rock. It's dark tones and passionate vocals meld perfectly. Michael Brook's Infinite Guitar provides a wonderful overtone. The first seven songs are all fantastic. The only weakness for me is Huuvola. My one regret with Cascade is that Peter didn't keep more of its style for a few more albums.
5,Musical Poet,"I have been a hard core Peter Murphy fan since ""Deep"" and am always left craving more of his sound and words. ""Holy Smoke"" left me somewhat unsatisfied with only a couple of tracks on there that I listened to again and again. I finally bought ""Cascade"" and am back full swing with my Peter worship. He delivers again and again with this album. It is a new level of Peter unheard before. Incredible arrangements of music and drippingly beautiful, poetic lyrics to seal the deal on another moving, fan-producing album. Every song has something entirely different to offer but all of them carry the thread of genuine Peter Murphy. This cd gives you the feeling you are listening to something that is private, sacred...more a journal of songs. Peter Murphy's voice still gives me goosebumps. I understand, now, the feelings of the Goth girl with spiky black hair that was crying and saying Peter's name over and over again at my first Peter Murphy concert in a little club in Germany. Get this album."
4,One of Mr. Murphy's best works!,"""Cascade"" was defined by most critics as Peter Murphy's worst, inconsistent work , but this magnifiscent album is, for me, Pete's best. Even though the lyrics aren't as touching and appealing as the ones in ""Deep"" and ""Should the world..."", we can see confessional lyrics, references to his family, his relationship with his wife, etc. Best songs: ""Mirror to my woman's mind"", ""Scarlet thing in you"", ""Huuvola"", ""Gliding like a whale"" - genuine jewels."
3,The Thoughtful Contrarian,"Rieff casts himself as a reluctant pessimist who doubts that humanitarian relief aid can do anything more than attend to the immediate needs of the tempest-tossed. Given that reality, Rieff feels that a traditional, neutral humanitarianism is the only option. He shows all the pitfalls of humanitarian action that adjusts to the political dynamics of local conflicts or aligns itself with donor governments. Rieff's perspective is a challenging one and a warning against humanitarian hubris. Still, while we must avoid thinking we can solve the world's ills, humanitarianism that deals purely with symptoms is even more prone to unintended consequences than aid efforts tailored to the realities on the ground."
2,Uninteresting,"I'm not sure what the author meant to achieve with this book. I suppose its irony is supposed to be deep and moving, For me, however, it is not interesting. The style comes across as deliberately childish, and who knows why? Strange indeed."
1,Dull and Dragging!,"Enjoyed ""Smilla's Sense of Snow,"" so when I saw this one on the bargain table I snatched it up. It dragged so much that I set it aside several times before managing to finish it. Guess the fact that I found this first edition hardback on the bargain table indicates how popular it was."
3,Worth Reading But Very Hard Work!,"Worth Reading, often thought provoking, but very hard work and maybe loses something in the translation to English?"
5,Some of us are looking up at the stars,"This book is entirely different from Hoeg's other works, in the same way that Borderliners is a world away from Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow. However, elements of that essential Hoeg charm we know and love surface continually throughout the novel. We are continually amazed at that ability of his to disregard reality and to enter his own strange world of twisted time, obsessive compulsives and the Danish social consience. This book takes longer than most to get your teeth into, but it's worth the effort. You finish feeling as if you've just enjoyed a long and fascinating stroll through turn of the century Denmark with a chatty and just a little bit mad child by your side, whispering things and occasionally sending you jolts of misery. Read the book and revel in his microcosim"
2,Drags too much,"This book has glimpses of greatness, but such glimpses are too few. Much of the book makes reference to situations that are too hard for the reader to grasp or are not very well described. Taken as a whole, the book has some great characters and some interesting dialog and points. However, it drags too much and some of the storylines lose the reader's interest."
4,betty crockers cookbook,"I had this book, but it got ruin over the years, just glad i could another it has the best beef stew recipe"
1,Never Received.,"I can't really give you a review on the item, since I never received the book because it was lost in the mail."
4,Well-built filter cartridge,This filter fits the Delonghi DAP-130 Hepa Filter body. The filters are easy to replace and seem to work well. I get roughly 4 to 5 months of use out of 1 cartridge.
5,Speedy Delivery,Nice book in good condition...an interesting book to read. Lofts is a wonderful writer although suspence is not her strongest point.
5,we have a large collection,my daughter collects Schleich dogs and horses. she spends hours playing with them. no other toy has such detail and life-like appearances.
3,Great Information for K2 Climbs,"As a fellow mountaineer interested in climbing the mountain myself, I found the information in this book very helpful. It is a solid piece of mountaineering literature with something for every adventure enthusiast. If you are thirsting for high country adventure epics like this one (albeit on a much smaller scale), you should also explore ""Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection"", also available at Amazon.com."
3,K2: Triumph and Tragedy by Jim Curran,"Got interested in books on K2 recently. This was a pretty good read written by someone who spent most of his time at Base Camp and didn't go high on the mountain, but was engaged in the rescue of the 2008 expeditions. Didn't particularly care for Jim's writing style, which did not fully engage me and was somewhat disjointed. If looking for a better read, I highly recommend Ed Viesturs book ""K2 - Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain."" That book covers many of the K2 expeditions, and was totally engrossing."
2,Easy to put down.,"Written in a distinctly British style, this books lacks the captivating excitement of most of the other extreme climbing stories. Worse yet, the author didn't make the climb! If you enjoy speculation, guessing, and backfitting, you might like this book. If you want ""edge of the seat"" excitement, pass this one by."
4,A very engaging read,"Ten years before the 1996 climbing disaster on Mt. Everest, 13 people died on the world's 2nd highest mountain -- and far greater climbing challenge -- K2. Although this book isn't as dramatic or well written as Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, it's still an excellent book full of true to life adventure and tragedy.Part of this is due to the fact that the adventure genre wasn't quite as developed or palpable in 1987. Part of it is that few of the characters are described in any depth. But mostly, the problem was that Jim Curran was there to film the expedition and never had any intention of summiting. Had he attempted to climb K2, I'm sure the story would have been richer."
2,It's No Into Thin Air,"You are probably interested in this book because you read ""Into Thin Air"" and are looking for a book of a similar nature. At least that describes how I discovered this book. Unfortunately, I found this book nowhere nearly as engaging as I did ""Into Thin Air,"" and therefore I would not recommend it."
2,"Written by a filmmaker, not a climber","It sounds like some horrendous things happened on K2 that summer, but the author wasn't really there for any of it. He spent most of the time at base camp, and can only report at best second hand on what happened. A lot of the book is taken up with what summer at base camp was like, which may not be what you're looking for."
4,Recommend!,"I liked this book very much. Curran is an excellent writer with a sense of humor to match. (I have waded through some mountaineering books not written by writers that were trying enough that I would not have finished if I weren't so interested in the subject). Curran is wonderful; humble and courageous, while making the experience very accessible to the reader."
2,Ditto,"Like other readers, I was able to easily put this book down at any time. The author spends his time at base camp, and does not really want to get caught up in the drama of the tragedies that are occurring above. For a much better (short story) about that summer, try Krakauer's ""Bad Summer on K2"" in Eiger Dreams or High:Stories of Survival from Everest and K2."
1,dull and easy to put down,"This is a dud all the way. It is written in a definate British style, and took over a week to read. If you want a good story, read ""Into Thin Air"". This is one to pass up."
3,Great Information for K2 Climbs,"As a fellow mountaineer interested in climbing the mountain myself, I found the information in this book very helpful. It is a solid piece of mountaineering literature with something for every adventure enthusiast. If you are thirsting for high country adventure epics like this one, you should also explore ""Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection"", also available at Amazon.com."
5,Nonpareil,"Shostakovich said, according to Rostropovich: ""You know, the 'Beethovens' no longer play so well. But when I see that they are still together, it gives me a feeling of security - I know that everthing in the world is still all right, because they continue to exist"". Amen."
5,A true inspiration,"I could not put this book down. His determination to live his dream is a true inspiration. It tells us the ups and downs, the sacrifices he had to make to live that dream. As a goalie myself, I have to admit we are strange. Who else in their right mind would face men with razors on their feet, ready to to fire a vulcanized hockey puck at you as hard as they can.I have dreams as well, and started playing goalie at the age of 45. After reading this book, in one sitting, I went out tonight and played the best game of my short career. It was my dream, but it pales in comparison to Ken's dreamThe book also gives us an interesting ""behind the locker room door"" look at minor league hockey. But this is not a book just for hockey fans"
5,Good Read,"An interesting story. Very inspirational. Well written. Its a true story and I love that, it gives you another reason to always have hope and to never give up."
2,Disappointing merchandise,"The Carolina Cottage Camden Blanket Chest in Antique Black was purchased at an excellent price. However, the styrofoam packing used to protect the chest during shipping rubbed the components of the chest during shipping. This created at least 25 long very narrow areas on the chest where the black finish was rubbed off to the bare wood. We purchased the chest to give as a gift and time did not permit returning it. My husband spent over two hours with a fine brush and satin black enamel touching up those areas. This is not something that we expect with quality merchandise."
2,"Cheap quality, doesn't hold up well.","Bought this to use as a toy chest. Cheaper quality than expected, and somewhat difficult to assemble (holes didn't line up appropriately). I've had it now for 2 months, and one of the bottom screws has become stripped, and the front panel has pulled away from the chest, exposing the wooden pegs holding it together. I've pulled apart the whole chest, and applied carpenter's glue, so we'll see how it holds up. There's only a few children's toys inside, so it should have held up better. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,good buy,"It comes in pieces, and though I was a little intimidated about assembling it, it was easy to build. You just need a Phillipp's Head and square screw driver, though Allen Keys come with the kit."
2,Carolina Cottage Chest,"I was disapointed with the quality of the product as received. The instructions were barely decipherable and the holes for the dowels were much larger than the dowels themselves and made for a sloppy fit. I had purchased a quality chest in North Carolina a few years before and was naive enough to think I was getting the same quality. When you buy ""Made in China"" you get what you pay for."
4,Good Value,For the money it's a great find. Easy assembly and looks great. My cat loves having the extra place to sit.
4,add some color,"We had fun adding sunflower decals to the top, front and sides of the blanket chest. This added some color and interest to the piece. My niece just loved it."
3,Esmeralda puppet,"Very cute puppet, nicely made, but the kids found it to be a tight fit inside for the fingers to manipulate easily."
5,For a school library,This cat puppet was a winner as far as the kids were concerned. They kept coming up and petting Esmeralda and loved her soft fur and cuddly look.
1,The worst Bon Jovi CD Single ever,"This CD single claims to have two new demo tracks. It really just has the same demos from ""It's my life"" #1. The names of the demo change, but the songs are the same. Do not buy this single."
3,songs listed not right,"I agree with Chuck, the songs listed are not the songs on the CD. I was very dissapointed."
2,Alright,I finished everything exciting about this game in about two hours. If you enjoy The Sims 2 and have the games then I would suggest not buying this game. There is only one possible outcome and after you're done playing that then the game is like a stripped down version of the Sims 2.
1,second quality,"I have bought Riedel stems from other sources and loved them. The 4 stems purchased ... were all seriously flawed. One arrived shattered, one had numerous bubbles throughout, another had a chip on the rim and the last had large ripples running through the glass. ..."
1,The glass was great but Amazon's shipping is the worst!!!,"I decided to buy this Riedel Sommeliers Bordeaux Grand Cru and Burgundy glasses from Amazon due to the the price and the name. When they arrived both were damaged. I returned them and wait for the replacements. When I got it, SURPRISE SURPRISE, they were all damaged again and Amazon said that they won't replace them anymore and I needed to return them again for the refund!!! The worst experience in online shopping ever!!!Tips: Buy these beautiful Riedel Glasses somewhere else. Trust me!!!"
1,came poorly packed--1 broken,Delicate glasses were poorly packed---1 of the 4 was broken. Will never buy glasses through Amazon again and I'm a long-time customer
3,"Good price, but not first quality","I bought 3 of these to replace ones that had broken (yes, they are very fragile). All contained a visible swirl in the bowl, indicating that these are factory seconds, not first quality.I kept them anyway since the price was good even for this quality and I didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of returning them. But I won't be buying any more any time soon."
1,Has no idea what he's talking about.,I just read the chapter on Chanukah and Christmas. It's just made up nonsense. He doesn't even know the roots of Christmas. He then invents links between Chanukah and Christmas that are plainly not there. I won't even bother reading the rest. In the trash.
5,I love these things!,"I'm no pro but I've played for about ten years and I love these dampners! HEAD used to make this style but they stopped a few years ago for reasons unexplained. I've tried their other designs and they just don't feel as nice as these. These dampners are hard to find but totally worth it!Oh and just to clarify, I only use one dampner at the bottom of the racket face. I don't use three like that crazy picture shows. Honestly, who does that? Nice try marketing!"
1,Not Satisfied,The picture in the ad was for a different version of the hair trap than the one that was actually sent. We did not get what the picture represented. When contacting the company we were told that we could sent the three we ordered back however the shipping to return the items would not be refunded and the cost to ship would be as much as the refund. We feel the product was misreprsented!
3,"Good, but could be better","First off - this isnt a soundtrack CD. No sir. What it is, is a group of songs 'Inspired by' Escape from LA, and a collection of 3 or 4 that had 3-4 second bits in the movie.When I bought this CD - I had seen LA the day before - and all I wanted to do was listen to the theme that plays at the end when the satellites go off... that theme that just gets under your skin...But was it on the CD? No... which is VERY annoying - and since half the songs werent even in the movie... very dissapointing..."
4,What's here is good . . .,". . . but not all of it is in the movie, and one important piece of music from the movie _isn't_ here: Dick Dale's ""Scalped"" (from the tsumani/surfing scene). So I'm posting this brief review for the benefit of anyone who's looking specifically for that piece.It's available on Dale's 1994 CD _Unknown Territory_ (http://www.amazon.com/Territory-Dick-Dale/dp/B0000005QS). Don't know why it's not on here, but this CD would have been better with it than without it.(Incidentally, Randy Newman's ""I Love L.A."" isn't on here either, even though we hear it on Map To The Stars Eddie's tour guide.)"
4,Escape from L.A. Soundtrack,This product is great and good hard rock music that is not being listened to today. As a matter of fact Nickleback comes out on this soundtrack... so you see Nickleback has been out and about for quite sometime now.
1,Not what you would think,"This dvd is not what you would expect. It looks like something someone made in their basement. It only has clips from 6 interviews and has no songs etc in here. The last interview is on a talk show and when they announced she was going to sing its cut off, not worth the money that was spent on it."
3,A well-written debut with a great sense of place,"FOWL PLAY is the kind of well-written, satisfying average mystery that keeps us one-a-day mystery addicts going. I would give it a ""C+"" which is not a bad grade for a first novel; Patricia Tichenor Westfall is better at her craft than many much more experienced writers. The four aspects of this small town mystery that particularly interested me were her sleuth Molly West (an intelligent and believable 50+), her elder characters (especially the admirable and independent 70+ Louella), her never-cutesy use of Appalachian folk culture (yes, sometimes Molly's husband Ken gets a little talky, but it's interesting talk and believable coming from a Soc prof), and her portrayal of the lives of the working poor. I look forward to reading future books in this series."
5,Masterpiece!,"I had the original and cherished it...only a week after purchasing it, my ex girlfriend stole it from me...I have since been unable to find it. If I can find this version, I WILL own it...I need it...I love it...MUST HAVE IT!!!!!"
2,not for fans of TKK's earlier work,"i was disapointed with this, its not a bad piece of work in itself but it was not what I was looking for. It is a far departure from their first few releases. if you are a fan of the earlier work they did, I would avoid this. If you are looking for expansion, then give it a try!"
4,Eagle Cuda 250 w/GPS,This is a good fish finder but I like the GPS and mapping functions even more. If you don't mind a gray and black screen it is a good product. It does take a little time to become acquainted with the product though.
4,Moral Dogma and Masonry,"A slow read about moral dogma and Masonry. Mr. Newton, an ordained Minister, attempts to explain the moral teachings behind Masonry. Accurate in most of his explanations, but a bit dry. Does a good job of showing Masonry as a support of morality and benevolance in society. Correct in information, dry in presentation. But at least it is correct, unlike most Masonic books. A must read for the Masonic collector."
2,Not the best.,"I purchased this burner because of the price. When I installed it, it doesn't fit flush with the range top. I believe this is due to the flimsy plugs that fit into the receptacle. The opposite side rises about 1/2"" off the surface. I wish I had sprung for a little more expensive one. It probably would have been worth the price."
2,Description incomplete.,"The package I received, clearly states near the top ""Fits most brands except GE and Hotpoint."" Of course, i have a Hotpoint stove. So now I have to return it and try again. Description and photos of this product do not appear to represent it well."
4,Chair pad review,I really like these chair pads they are a great quality and the price was great at 22 dollars for 4. These chair pads don't have the annoying ties on the chairs. These pads stay on the chair with no problems and they are very comfortable. The only cosmetic down side is that the rubber backing comes up kindove high where the pad meets the back of the chair so you can see the backing. For me this was a small price to pay for quality and comfort.
2,misses the mark,"I expected to be thrilled by this novel about neo-Nazis and their attempts to gain power using the spear that pierced the side of Christ, but it was an effort to work my way through this novel. I believe it's focus is too narrow-- it's missing a sense of international intrigue that you would get from a good spy novel, or a sense of awe that you would get from a novel that knows something about the occult. In short, it needed to have opened up a bit more, to have a more global perspective on what are basically earth-shaking events. It doesn't help that some of the action scenes are a bit awkward, either. An adequate time-killer, nothing more."
3,Wild,"This is really a wild book. It includes the Mossad, neonazis (including, believe it or not, Heinrich Himmler!) and a heavy, really heavy dose of occultism. As usual for (the early) Herbert, the main part of the book consists of action-scenes which are not that exciting but at least keep the book moving at a fast pace. The book isn't really bad but has a ""cheap"" feeling. So, you will not really regret reading this book. On the other hand, you will not regret skipping it, either. Review by Oliver Naujoks, Marburg/Germany."
3,Could have been great.,"I love the concept of this series. Multiple vignettes, each interesting, with one exception. The part with Dennis Hopper is silly, and ridiculous. It highlights his real life I suppose. If it were eliminated this series would shine as a 5 star."
4,An overlooked camp classic,"""Tina Benez"" (s/he prounounces it ""ben-AYE"") is the drag name for this dude who once worked at the NYC gay bookstore ""A Different Light"" (151 W. 19th St. at 7th. Ave.) in Manhattan in 2000/2001. S/he was so animated and hilarious we were in stitches. Her long-suffering co-worker Tom (from NJ) did most of the work while Tina clowned and camped around. OK, the CD is late-90s electro-pop, heavily processed, fun, dancefloor remix gay music. One track, ""I wanna be loved by you"" has SEVEN remixes! ""Ghost in you"" is my favorite of all the songs because it has a haunting beauty(it has one remix included.) ""Tina"" told us her CD was #1 in Thailand, and we've been laughing about that ever since. It sure must be rare, considering at the time I write this the only two sellers are asking between $60-65 bucks for it! ""Tina"" signed the CD artwork insert for me. I wonder what ever happened to ""Tina Benez""? Hope s/he's well and happy!"
4,Washburn Classical Guitar,"I wanted a reasonable priced classical guitar and this model fit the bill. Sure there are others with a higher price, but for the money, this one is fine. Washburn and their China affiliate ensures quality and the sound is very nice. If you are looking for a good entry level classical style guitar then this would be a fine choice."
5,An excellent club pumper.,"I went to the local club the other night and was totally pumped by this track. If people wasn't dancing, their head was at least bobbing with the beat. Grab a copy, you won't be disappointed."
1,Extremely disappointed in this product,"Our daughter had experienced a series of ear infections this winter, so we were excited to read about the potential of this product online (I believe it was on Dr. Sears' site). According to the instructions, you have to put the EarCheck through an initial verification test, presumably to confirm that the product is functioning properly prior to using on your child. Well, despite following the instructions exactly and trying about ten different times, our EarCheck failed the verification test and ended up going straight back to Amazon. Needless to say, our high hopes for this product ended up in complete disappointment and a total waste of time."
5,It Works!,"We've had this for just over a year.It's tricky to get your sick child to be quiet and still for 30 seconds. But, it does give accurate results! Our ped was amazed.Unfortunately, it doesn't actually fix the problem. We still wound up with ear tubes!"
1,Bad experience,This product did not work - said fluid unlikely - and thus no ear infection - two times when my son had really bad ear infections in both ears ! And when I asked for a refund they just gave me a new Ear check as a replaceent and sad they could not give me my money back
5,100 % Accurate,The ear Check has always correctly detected if there was fluid in the inner ear. You simply have to gently pull back and up on the ear if you don't get a reading. We have used it trouble free for years.
1,Terrible Results,"My daughter had both eardrums rupture at 5 months, which is very rare and so I purchased this product. I thought it was working fine b/c several times I'd taken her in for a suspected ear infection and the doctor's would tell me she was fine - no fluid or infection. So I continued to use the monitor, this month my daughter had one eardrum rupture and the other had fluid but no infection and my monitor always gave a reading of level one as before. So clearly this product didn't catch any fluid and an eardrum that ruptured the day after I checked it with the ear check monitor. I am now going to purchase a Dr. Mom's Otoscope and hope I have better results."
1,Tip too large for children,Works great on adults but is worthless for kids as it won't fit in their ear well enough to get an accurate reading.
4,Translating Celtic Christianity into a contemporary culture.,"Mitton identifies the principles behind the attractiveness of Celtic Christianity. Then, through exploring the lives of Celtic saints, makes an excellent argument for their applicability in an urban world."
1,Fake riedel glasses,"I ordered 4 riedel sommelier riesling glasses--they arrived in 4 separate packages. When my husband opened them, we discovered that 3 of the glasses were fakes--although stamped with a removable riedel label, they were obviously not actually riedel glasses --they were a heavy glass with a thick stem. We own a collection of riedel glasses, and these were not anywhere near the quality of riedel. We plan to return them."
3,connnected,"what can I say, right cable, right price.now adays you can easily be raped over the coals for quality cables, that was not the case with this monster cable it wass as expected with the twist of being reasonably price."
2,Don't buy unless you want two mono cables,"I was shopping for a stereo cable and had good success with Monster cables previously. What I received were two completely separate (but color-coded) mono cables -- I immediately sent them back for a refund. I expected a joined double cable. Amazon's photos do not clearly show that the cables are separate, nor is there anything in the detailed description about this. I already have too many cables behind my cabinets and on my floor -- why would I want two more when one double cable would suffice? Conclusion: the photos are misleading and the description is incomplete."
3,Good Cable!,"I beat my set of mk400s and i must say they suffered it withstyle. After smashing 2 pair of them into my car's DIN for a year i pulled out a pair and put them to work with my home theatre. They look good as new, and sound as FINE as ever."
3,OK in a pinch,"I bought this product because my son had one (also called the ""Shark"") that would pick up sizable dog kibbies off the floor. This one was $20.00 more than he paid and it does an OK job if you're looking for a quick cleanup. The suction does not seem to be nearly that of what my son had, but it will pick up dog hair and crumbs and such. Also, I find that the bagless compartment has to be emptied quite often. Sorry, I couldn't say more. I was really excited to buy this machine, but not so excited when I actually used it."
2,Not bad... BUT...,"Gary Smalley must have been one of the largest jerks to walk the planet. Some of the things he did to his wife are on the border of unbelievable. His poor behavior has given him the theory that everything that is wrong in your marriage is YOUR (the man's) fault. Think I'm kidding? I'm not. He says that everything that is wrong in your marriage can be traced back to something you did/didn't do. While it is important to take responsibility for your actions, I think he has taken it too far.Despite this shortcoming, there are quite a few good insights in the book. I would recommend it, but read it with an entire shaker of salt."
5,Buy it and READ IT!,"This is a WONDERFUL book, quick and easy to read, yet chockfull of great advice. Smalley described my wife (and her complaints about our relationship) perfectly. In fact, I was astounded by how well he voiced her issues -- almost word for word! Also provided a good understanding of why she felt that way and how I could realign my priorities and renew my relationship. The best book I've read on the topic."
2,not what i expected,"While I found this book interesting enough, it just wasn't what I expected. Again not that I recommend to anyone."
5,Gary Smalley has Godly Insight into Having a Loving Marriage.,"If you read this book with an open mind, with the mindset that you could do better as a husband, this book will rock your world.When I read this book I was under the impression that he had intimate knowledge of what was wrong with my marriage! This was over 10 years ago and I have to say I still refer to this book from time to time. The insight Smalley offers into the male and female psyches is uncanny. He knows exactly why women are the way they are and how men, through their woefull lack of understand of gender differnces, exacerbate the problem.I have recommended this book to so many people I ought to get a commission. But I believe and have experienced the fruit of applying the understanding of this book in my own life and marriage.Whether you have been married 4 months or 40 years, this book, and the companion volume ""For Better or Best"" will show you how to have a Godly marriage based on trust, committment, and love."
2,Consistently followed his directions and ..nuthin!,"I tried his methods pretty damn consistently and still came up with nothing. I am a college graduate who has worked hard for my family for twenty years and my income has allowed my wife to stay home with our kids as she has wished. Among other things I cut back drastically on the amount of time and money spent on hobbies and kept it up for years, like Smalley said. I watch little TV and follow no professional sports. I am home nearly every weekend. Followed his advice and it still wasn't enough. Smalley makes a few good points into the psychology of the female mind but he completely liberates them (no pun intended) from any real responsibility in the relationship. The used copies for under a dollar might be worth it but don't waste any more than that.I am spending more time and money on hobbies again. If I can't get my wife's affection or cooperation, I might as well stop sacrificing for it."
5,Shifter Stick,"This shift lever stick bolted to my TKO 600 for my transmission conversion just fine. Nice chrome finish, etc. It's a bit on the long side, but from what I understand, it's the same dimensions as the factory shift lever that belonged on my late 70's Trans Am."
3,Design flaws ruined the better functions,"I returned mine for a couple of reason: The transport makes too much noise, especially when I listen late at night (I don't want to hear the machine, just the music); and the alarm does not allow you to set volume, so unless you remember to listen at night at the level you want to wake up to (so much for the sleep function) it may be too lound or too quiet in the morning. I found the Sony CMT-ED1 to have better sound, and to be more intelligently designed, for less money."
4,COOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLL,"I used to have this, but I had to trade it in with AIWA CX-NA50, a 3-CD changer with supposedly more goodies than this little JVC(my sister suggested that I should). Now, how dearly I miss that cute, little JVC!!I am a computer addict, and I suppose that makes me a bit more tolerant of glitches any hardware has. I must say, this JVC's ""gem"" is much better than the AIWA one I have. The AIWA is much more bigger, and has much bigger speakers, but the controls are hectic. I CANNOT believe that it is made(or designed) by Japanese engineers.On the other hand, small and flashy appearance of this JVC is not just skin-deep. Easy accessibilty to controls, excellent design and great sound. I MISS YOU, JVC FS-7000. I would kill my AIWA for the JVC. Overall, I rate this as a 4 star, only because of its size. Everything else, 5+."
5,"great sound, small package","owned one for 2 yrs. and loved it. great sound from such a small package. perfect for college dorm room, or bedroom use. you wont regret this purchase. great deal."
5,Excellant Product with Great Sound,Within a very few minutes I had my JVC FS-7000 up and running. I was very impressed with how little space the unit takes and the quality of the sound. The manual was very easy to use and I quickly had my favorite FM stations programmed into memory.I would highly recommend it for anyone who has very little space and wants a great sounding system.
5,"Fantastic sound and features in a tiny, good looking package","I bought one of these two years ago and I'm still in love with it; and it's been updated since then with some small improvements. It has high end features like sub-woofer output, and digital (laser) input. It makes the perfect clock-radio; has sleep features and can wake you up with the radio, or music from a CD. You can even program it to wake you with a particular song. Best of all, when the alarm goes off, the volume rises slowly from 0 to the level you specify when you set the alarm. I still can't get over how great and full the sound is from the little speakers. I seriously wish I could afford to buy another one for my office."
3,"Nice Product, but Value?","Its amazing to me what they are getting for these compact stereo systems. Sure, this one has some nice little touches, but, where it counts, its strictly mass market materials (the CD transport, the preamp, the amplifier topology and, except for the admittedly nice wood and glass touches, the construction.If you want pure sound and can live without all the extraneous features, check out Cambridge Audio's SoundWorks. Its $99, and for that you get a powered subwoofer and two satellite speakers, very small. You have to add a portable CD player, but that is pretty cheap these days. The sound is KILLER. I don't believe the JVC unit can compare, certainly not in bass response. For under $200, half of the JVC system price, its a great system."
2,not quite good enough,"Found the sound to be flat when playing classical music, can not seem to clearly transport the higher notes and subtle lower notes. If it can't play classical, then what good is it?"
4,good but inappropriate,"All i'm going to say about this disc is that its really cool music, and its a fun homage for someone who specifically grew up with SHR and who is into indie music in their ""adulthood"", but this CD doesnt work for kids today. I would feel really awkward and uncomfortable playing Chavez's version of ""Little 12-toes"" to my neice, yet i wouldnt mind rocking out to it in my car. So in a nutshell, this disc is not really for kids, its for the kids who have already grown up."
5,My girls LOVE this CD!,"They have a couple of the DVD's and love the CD. We understood it wasn't the original artists before purchasing. We love the remake of ""Electricity"". Some of the remakes are difficult to understand the lyrics, but they still love the songs! These make learning so fun! (Even I can't get these songs out of my head!!!!)"
5,EXCELLENT Tribute,"This is a GREAT album. Its not the original musicians, its a tribute by modern bands (at least modern for the mid to late 90's).This is a catchy album and a very good buy and tribute!"
3,Effective tribute album better for fans,"If you liked the groovy educational kids show you will perhaps pick and choose through this decent sized compilation of mostly 90's alternative acts covering some learning fun, but few songs possess the power to transcend fanboy roots (most artists welcome the warm cheesy style found in the show) and simply stand on it's own musically ala Blind Melon's ""Three Is A Magic Number"", where even multiplication tables sung by Shannon Hoon sound sincere."
4,Pavement rocks,"Being a huge Pavement fan, I was mostly interested in their cover of No More Kings. Their reworking of the tune is great, definately on par with their eariler work, and at the very least out performs most of the S&E era B-sides."
2,Very disappointed!,"I bought this CD thinking that I'd be enjoying all those great ""Schoolhouse Rock"" songs in a new format. And it is in a new format, but I'm not enjoying them. I think these songs are definitely best in their original form and should remain that way. It seems to me that most of the bands just mutilated the songs. That's why I was surprised to see that many 4 and 5 star reviews! Also, my one last complaint is that the bands don't always sing the exact same lyrics as the original, yet they include the original lyrics with the CD, so it's kind of hard to sing along with. As for me, I'm selling this CD and buying the box set of all the originals!"
4,"Fun, fun, fun","This album is a fun way to escape the reality of modern music. I used several songs for skits at my graduation party almost two years ago and they were a huge hit. My friends and I still get a good laugh listening to it every now and then. How can anyone deeply analyze or criticize something like this? I didn't grow up on Schoolhouse Rock, but it seems to me that it's not something to be picked apart or taken too seriously. It was supposed to make education fun, and this cd is simply bringing it back. True, the songs don't sound exactly the same as they used to, but that's the whole idea. And my six year old sister still walks around the house sometimes singing ""Conjunction Junction."" This album will ad a nice flavor and interesting twist to anyone's music collection."
3,I prefer the original artists,I bought this by mistake thinking the songs were performed by the original artists. I think you can only hear the originals by getting the dvd. I was pretty bummed at first but my child loves this. My only complaint is that you can't understand all of the words so some of the educational value of the songs is lost.
5,Probably not for Everyone But...,"As with any collaborative effort, there are a few throwaways, but the great tracks far outweigh the duds. Moby's version of ""Verb"" is just absolutely phenomenal, and I was shocked that I enjoyed Skee-Lo's contribution so much. Man or Astro-Man?, Buffalo Tom, Daniel Johnston, Ween, The Lemonheads, and Blind Melon all stick pretty close to the originals and do a terrific job. Definitely worth having, if you're a Schoolhouse Rock/AlternaRock fan... 'Cause knowledge is power!!"
4,Your Mind Grows Flowered,"This is a very nifty CD that puts a more modern-day twist on the old ""Schoolhouse Rock"" songs that we all know and love. I bought this ""on spec"" with the idea that it was quirky and different enough to possibly have some gems - and indeed it does.I'm not much of a hip-hop fan, but the real standout was ""The Tale Of Mr. Morton"" by Skee-Lo - worth the price alone."
2,does not hold 20oz,"Much smaller than it appears. Does not hold 20oz. I gave it away for christmas, instead wishing for one of those old 32oz Aladdin coffee mugs they used to sell or give away at 7-11. I have one old one. It keeps my water cold, and I do not have to fill it often."
4,Big/Nice lid.,"This is the sceond cup I have gotten. I love the size, It's like 2 large cups of coffee.The lid keeps the coffee in unless you get to wild, it has a very little hole in it so it can breath.My first one, I dropped, full of coffee and the top part of the handle came loose, I used a large zip tieand used it for another year, yes I put it in the dish washer no problems.I just got another one because I have misplaced the lid.If the handle was attached better I would say this cup is perfect.It keeps coffee hot to warm for 4 hours.Big man / Big Cup just don't drop it.I would buy another if needed, even at the price."
4,ok,stings are ok didnt last as long as i thought they would have. and i really do say metal strings sound so much better on a UKE
1,Broken the day we opened it,Within the first hour of buying this product the second hand broke off and caused the hands not to turn.. was very flimsy and not well made. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you enjoy dissappointing your children!!!!!!
1,Watch broke on Christmas morning...,"I purchased the Alex Watch for my 8 year old daughter as a gift from Santa. The watch face has a small round purple piece that sits in the center of the wathch face where the small and long hands are positioned. This piece came loose and is floating around the watch and jamming the hands. So, the watch hands cannot move forward. Frustrating and useless, since I cannot return it."
2,Alex Watch,"My daughter received this watch as a birthday gift and loved it. She wore it once and the crystal cracked but the watch still worked. After reading the other reviews, I'm hesitant to buy a replacement watch. It doesn't seem to be durable enough for children."
3,Alex Watch It,"I ordered two of these for my Grandaughters for Christmas, they were there on time, I have always been happy with Amazon meeting their commitments. One of the watches the stem came out the first time you tryed to set the time. I returned that watch and Amazon replaced it. When I got the new watch again the stem came out when they tryed to set it but it went back in and stayed firm so my Granddaughter was happy. I would always recommend Amazon but I don't think I would recommend the watch."
3,Stay Away From Amazon,"No problem with this product. Here's the deal--if the shipment is OK, Amazon is fine. But if you need customer service, as I did for another shipment, you are in deep trouble. Amazon's ""customer service"" is in Thailand--they are incompetent. They are liars. They are either horribly trained or are purposefully misleading--a horror.Never again will I buy from Amazon."
1,I should have known better.,"Kinda mean undertone here. What can I say I wanted to mute the entire cast, wait for it to be free."
1,One of the worst horror movies I've seen,It hits nearly every ghost/found-footage cliché in the book while managing to burn itself out too quickly and be extremely boring. Avoid it.
1,THIS SUCKED!,"Coming from a guy that even found good sides to ""The Devil Inside"", this movie was the worst horror movie I have ever seen. It is extremely boring and all the somewhat exciting parts are shown in the trailer. Trust me, DO NOT get this movie. It isn't worth the money, nor the time."
2,My review,"Weird!!! I thought it had such a terrible ending.....Story started out good, but got worse as it went along. No"
1,should be apt 0,because if I could give it a 0 I would. I must admit the last scene at the end made me jump but I was half asleep
2,Effects interesting but....,....no logic at all to the story. Although there were some pretty creepy parts there was an unsatisfactory let-down of an ending.
3,"Well, what did you expect?","This is your usual disjointed jolty camera psuedo documentary. It has it's moments, but it leaves you with a feeling of 'what the hell?' I just wish there had been SOME history of the apartment other than the explanation of the current situation."
4,excellent film,"Probably one of the better paranormal,maybe even the best,shot in digital video ghost stories I have ever seen. Although the plot is not particularly original the film`s execution more than makes up for it. Great performances and legit scares make it a must see."
1,Money back guarantee.,"I want my money back. I compare this to Blair Witch, The Grudge, White Noise and The Shining. I want my money back."
1,BRUSHING YOUR TEETH CAN BE MORE TERRIFYING!,"Worst movie I have seen in a VERY long time. Don't waste your money or, especially, your time.There is ZERO fear factor. And absolutely no questions are answered.Seriously, don't even let curiosity get the better of you. Do yourself a favor and watch any one of the Paranormal Activity movies. Even watching paint dry is far more exciting than this movie."
3,A little too much too often,"It's fun to watch at first, but it just seems a little campy after a while. It's like they tried to take slices of other movies, lots of other movies, and put them all in to one. They also fall prey to frequent STM (showing the monster). No subtle movements in the night camera footage. They just make the entire world start to shake...right from the start. Not great, but if you don't care about the ten dollars and have seen everything else on the interwebs then go ahead."
4,Creepy,"If you like the Paranormal Activity Series, you will like this. It's not for everyone, but a definite watch for horror and scary movie lovers."
2,apartment 143,It was a complete waste of nearly 2 hours of my life. I would have rather had explosive vomitting. Dont waste your money
1,hated this movie,this movie has all the conponets to be good just pour acting parinomal activity in an apartment not a house low budget
3,same stuff,Not as good as I expected. Scary moments. Again video camera storyline. Would not recommend...unless you like these type of movies a lot...seen better.
4,"Doesn't beat Paranormal Activity, but good","I was excited to see Fred from Roseanne! Otherwise, it was suspenseful but confusing. Your heart really breaks for the widower."
4,Decent Horror Flick,"For what it is I thought it deserved 4 stars. I enojoyed it. Don't expect it to be an award winner, but for a this genre I really liked it."
2,screw this movie,"at first, i thought... maybe an old fashioned haunted movie. But then it gets stupid.Pass it up. it's like paranormal experience 2 or 3.bummer. was hoping peeps would finally see that there is another world here. But, this is not the movie. pass on friend. :)"
4,Compare to Paranormal Movies,I like the movies intensity in some places and special effects in others. But it left me with questions. Was the dad a creep? Was anything happening to the little boy?
3,"Not bad, not great, either, but not a total waste of time.","This movie is a nifty little quasi-scary thriller to pass the time watching. I wasn't totally enthralled with it, but I wasn't tempted to go check my email or do other things while this was playing in the background. I liked it right away, and was able to hang through to the end without a problem. If you're looking for something super scary, this movie isn't it. Paranormal Activity was way creepier to me."
4,fun...definitely some scares where i jumped,"Yes, some of it was a little predictable but not all. The ""Blair witch - I held the camera thing"" isn't too bad. I really hate that so I'd notice.I jumped a couple times.Won't win an Oscar but worth watching"
2,Same old same old,Same jerky movement and fast flips and flashes . Tired of all the haunted movies and shows going to this type of filming its gotten too old .
1,This movie SUCKED BIG TIME,I love the genre but this one was HORRIBLE. Don't bother renting and most especially DON'T BUY IT. All the high number reviews must have been the actors or director trying to boost the sales... it needs all the help it can get so I guess I don't blame them. NOT SCARY... I jumped one time when my eyes were closed due to the strobe light and my epilepsy being affected by it. I jumped because of the loud sound. They try to help the movie with noise but thats all it is NOISE. I wasted my money - that sucks more.
3,It was just okay,"It was a pretty typical and predictable paranormal movie shot in a ""reality"" type mode like Paranormal Activity"". Worth a view to pass the time."
3,It was fairly unique and watchable,"The reason I didn't give it 4 starts was because they kind of held back a bit. This movie had mad potential, but they stayed pretty conservative. Good suspense and that's always what I like. A little dissapointed with the ending though, but still not a bad movie, I don't regret watching it."
4,Nice ending,It kept me interested all the way thru and it was spot on what I expected. I have watched it more than once
2,Just another cheap horror flick,"Just another Blair Witch Project style single cam horror movie. Nothing scary about it other than the sudden camera motions to reveal what wasn't there a second ago. The plot was at least unique, but the end was sudden. Everything played out in the last 20 minutes of the movie...everything before then was just random weird occurrences. Watch it if you're bored, like I was, or if these types of movies interest you. I won't be looking at it again, though."
5,very scary,"I don't like ghost stories, they scare the scrap out of me, and this was no different! It took me 3 times to finish watching it."
3,Apartment 143,This had suspense but storyline could have been better. There were creepy moments that made you want to look away. That I liked!
2,It was okay.,I watched this because there was nothing else to watch. Nothing was ever resolved in the movie and it was really wierd.
2,Meh,Horrible acting just ruins 95% of the movie. The Dad in this movie is extremely over dramatic the entire time.
1,Terrible. Please don't watch.,This movie is poorly edited and poorly written. I can go on and on about how each character is terrible but I'd rather just keep it short and let you know that I am like you and I seriously regretted renting this.I liked Paranormal Activity and Cloverfield and a lot of 'found footage' films but this one is not worth it in the least.I can even stand watching cheesy paranormal shows..
1,severely lacking..,"This horror movie, if it could even be classified as that, is an extremely sad copy of Paranormal Activity and if it could be rated as ZERO stars, it should. If you have not seen the Paranormal Activity series, this might actually be enjoyable for you, but it would be a stretch. The acting is horrible and you can tell it was a low budget film. I skipped around through the entire movie until I had enough, it was a total waste of my time to even watch it. I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie unless you want a good laugh."
1,"Look up ""Ridiculous"" in the dictionary!","I love scary movies. Not just horror movies or those with a bunch of gore but the ones that make you want to check under your bed or in your closet like you did when you were a kid! This one didn't even come close. I found myself drifting off into wonderland or even balancing my checkbook while watching. Boring! In total, there may have been about 8 to 9 seconds of actual SCARE. Oh and don't get me started on the acting. I've sat through a lot of ""B-movies"" but this one completely reminded me of the type of ""acting"" that takes place in adult films. Cheesy to say the least. But hey! You gotta decide for yourself. Maybe you'll find it entertaining. I would worry if you do though. You might possibly need a doctor to check and make sure your neurons are still firing upstairs : )"
4,Better than most of its genre - worth the rental,"I love love LOVE a good supernatural horror movie, and this one doesn't disappoint. Where so many have jumped on the bandwagon of the found/taped/pseudo-paranormal ""ghost hunters"" format to varying degrees of success, Apartment 143 excels. I fully expected the last scene but nearly jumped out of my skin despite the expectation. Full chills. If you like the genre, don't miss this one!"
3,entertained but not wowed!,The movie starts off with a bang but leaves you still questioning. Puts forth some up to date info on poltergeist scientific explanations but leaves you wanting more.
3,A Shortened Version of The Great Lent Book,"This is a good introductory version of Alexander Schmemann's excellent book, also titled Great Lent (Journey to Pascha). Be aware however, that it is not the same book. I find it useful but read the full book every Great Lent. This version covers the basics well for Orthodox Christians, and I'm glad that I purchased it. I look forward to the full print version being in digital format but for now will stick to the print version for Lenten reading."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not what I expected. I did not find it to be easy reading. After a couple of attempts at reading it, I closed the book and have not bothered again. It is not anything I would recommend to friends."
3,looks great but poor tailoring on seams,"The reason I'm giving this skirt 3 stars is that this looks beautiful and fits really well. I was thrilled when I put it on. But on closer inspection I noticed that the stitching on the seams of the tiers have raw edges with threads hanging out. And they are on the outside of the skirt where it is visible in good light. I don't think it will last more than a couple of wears, but good for a day out for the price."
1,Waste of money,I am not sure who this is for.I could not spend any time to find out more because it is very poorly built and odd looking graphics.Dumped it in trash within 5 mins after I opened the package.
5,Vida en el Amor,"I've read this book in English and the Spanish original,and all I can say about it is that this is a very, very rich work.Reality is goodness. What is love, is, and what isn't love, is not. Sin and evil do not exist as such because they aren't self-sustaining, and they should be regarded as love gone astray instead. Greed (love of money) and selfishness (love of oneself) are simple products of ""mischanneled love,"" and even then -- in the presence of such 'sins'-- we are drawn to our peception of the ultimate romance we all search for: The Good, or God --depending on your taste. ;)"
4,Great Speakers,I have had my speakers for about three weeks now. I bought 4 of them and spread them around the yard and I love them. I looked at other stores for the same type of product and would have paid 3 to 4 times more than what I was able to get these four. They have all the performance that I would ever need in an outdoor type speaker. I would recomend these to any one.
5,Don't expect Bose sound - still worth the price,"I purchased two sets if these speakers last July. I am extremely happy with these. By no means are these Bose speakers, but I am not about to spend that amount of money for outdoor speaker for the pool.Set your expectations accordingly. A $30 to $50 per speaker will not provide sound like an outdoor concert speaker. You also have to be aware of the wire size requirements when setting these up. Use appropriate wire size for the run length. Don't use too small of wire and expect great sound from any speaker.These are small in size and not overwhelming. They blend fairly well into the desert landscape.I would recommend these speakers to anyone looking for quality sound for normal listening in a family backyard. I would spend more for a better quality speaker if you are entertaining frequently and have large gatherings. These will probably be too small to handle that demand."
5,Rock Speakers,"They fit the landscaping well. However, there were no basic installation directions with them. I did not know how to connect them to a stereo/audio component. I had to get help from someone to connect them. This manufacturer needs to take this in consideration and include basic instructions."
1,Trash,"The sound is terrible, the ability to transmit inconsistant, but what do you expect for so little."
1,Somethings wrong!!!,"I did a search for wireless, this came up and I purchased it. My mistake, but why did it come up under wireless??????"
4,Great for the money,"For the price these things work great. They didnt look to bad either BUT I got some paints and made them match my surrounding pool rocks. They have been getting drenched by the pool, garden hose, rain, etc and they have held up great! Not a bad sound either for the price."
5,Great album form a great band,"Having been given a copy of Horse drawn wishes about seven years ago, I have been wanting to hear shoulder voices for a long time. I was not disappointed, I still cannot understand how this band was not huge. I am not surprised here in the States since our music scene is crap bar none. Regardless a great album, the song that stands out for me is Bella. Brilliant. I highly recommend this album for anyone who likes the UK sound of rock."
5,Very good read..,It is a well writen book and gives great information on the sport of Schutzhund as well as great training advice...
4,Need a magnify lens to read....,Very good book if you can read it. Small print makes eyes very exhausted. Five stars to notion one star to printing.
3,Not so interesting Mocumentary...,"I rented ""2 Days"" because the premise sounded intriguing enough: An actor who decides to kill himself in 2 days has a film crew follow him around up until the very end. Maybe if this had been a documentary on a real person's life it could have worked. But I found this movie to be very unreal and unsatisfying. Don't get me wrong, Paul Rudd is a good actor and quite sexy I might add, but I could barely keep myself awake to watch the movie in it's entirety. It wasn't a horrible movie, but I can understand why it went straight to video. When killing yourself in two days starts looking more appealing than continuing to watch this movie... well, I'd say it's failed as good entertainment."
1,How bad can a movie be?,"Wow. It's rare I consider a movie absolutely horrendous, but this one qualifies. We are given absolutely no reason whatsoever to care for this guy, and halfway through this tedious excuse for a movie, I found myself yelling ""DIE already"". When he doesn't kill himself in the end, all I wanted to do was shove him face down in the ocean and drown him. A dumb stupid awful ""indie"" movie that is a waste of film, time and effort."
1,garbage,"I think producer Mo Ramchandani should be commended for his integrity in honestly reviewing his own film. This is rare in an industry that is proliferated with bald old men who are more interested in turning a profit than producing a good film. This was by far the worst film i have ever seen, i urge anybody on this page not to waste their time. Director Sean Mcginly should have been fired on the first day of shooting and replaced with anyone, even a farm animal, and then maybe the psycholgical complexities of suicide would have been better explored. I look forward to more from producer Mo Ramchandani, its clear he's not going to make teh smae mistake twice!!!!!"
5,They keep getting better,My excitement was justified as I unwrapped Cryptic Valentine and played it a few times. The Maggies sound great and their tunes are hummable and catchy. Most everyone I've played them for has commented on this breed of pop being less fluff and more filling. Dig deeper and your get more. Lots more. Like a triple decker sandwich of sound. Those of you who aren't getting it as gifts from friends should run right out and buy it!
4,ART/EROTICA HAS IMPROVED,"Love and sex were doing well in the 17th-18th Century, as exampled by the numerous paintings and sketches. It also showed that for humans there are only many ways to make love and display the human body. Some of the scenes were hilarious and funny, while others were typically beautiful and enjoyable. There was little S & M but a lot of mingling between nuns and soldiers, and other combinations considered inaccessible and part of fantasies. As with most Taschen books, it was well documented and printed in a high quality fashion. I liked it for the art and also for the historical significance of male-female desire and copulating. I suppose much of erotica has improved with the modern DVD's and computers, printing processes, and explicit colors, but this erotica was fun and intriguing."
2,big Mckillip fan but not of this book,"Patricia Mckillip is a beautiful writer. Her stories are told with grace and style. Her characters are compelling. Many of her plots offer some refreshing angle or perspective on a tired theme. So I was shocked when I failed to engage with this book. I thought it must be a fluke and re-read it. No luck the second time either. I guess female musicians and her twin sister soldier plus the mysterious twin bond isn't compelling. That's it. Anymore than that and from my point of view there won't be any reason at all to read the book. If you are a Mckillip fan, this might be one you get from the library before you decide purchase."
5,Hot/cold facial masks,"I used these, cold only, after eye surgery. They helped keep the swelling down, worked well. I would recommend them."
4,An excellent first novel,"This book absolutely surprised me. It is like reading three or four books in one. In the beginning Nicolas writes about the characters as children. The story is told in such a way that you can actually feel the emotions of the characters. As the book progresses, many new characters are introduced. Some are sinister, but most are charming. At one point in the story there is a very touching romance that honestly brought tears to my eyes. It truly shows the sensitivity of the author. I don't think that anyone who reads this book will be disappointed."
5,Great Multi Function,"I purchased an old truck that had had stake tie downs on it box at one time. The holes and the un-oxidized paint was noticeable. The 6 cleats I added, 2 per side and tail gate, added real eye appeal and utility for securing cargo using either tie downs or elastic netting. The price was right!!!! very satisfied."
1,Not strong enough !!,I have been using a 10% Glycolic Pad from another company. I've been very happy with that product but felt I needed something a little stronger.I purchased the Glycolix Treatment Pads in 15% and 20%. I figured I would build a tolerance to the 15 so I also purchased the 20.The first time I used the 15% I felt nothing. The next day I tried the 20% pads. I felt a very slight tingling sensation. Hardly noticeable.Tonight I tried my old 10% pads. I can still feel like they are working. They give that burn / tingling feeling.I'm not sure if you have to feel that tingling for the product to be working or not. I would think yes.Someone else wrote that these pads are a knock off of the real thing.At this point I can not recommend this product. I will still continue to try this product since I already have it.If my opinion changes I will post it here.
2,p-r-e-d-i-c-t-a-b-l-e,"i did expect to like this, and was obviously disappointed. too typical. listening to it, i worried that i had overestimated my generation's rock music, because these guys were right there with candlebox and dino jr. and soul asylum and buffalo tom etc. but i never really liked any of those bands either, so there you go. i only listened to this one once, so i very well may be slighting it a bit. but still, you know, you never get a second chance..."
5,This is a great fun game - very imaginative indeed!,"A must for all treasure hunt fanatics! Its got my thumbs up! Two thumbs up, way up!!"
1,Totally stupid,"Can't really say much more. Dumb story, bad acting, the kind that doesn't make a movie badly good."
1,Can we say stupid?,"I bought this movie because of the first review written. I just about want to kick my own butt. This movie is lower than a B-rated movie. It's an F rated one! Someone shot it with a camcorder and thought it would be fun to film people from below their chins, angled upward. I got so tired of looking up people's noses. I started to think I was watching Blair Witch, but snot never flowed. Anyway, if I had it to do all over again, I would've spent that 90 minutes pulling out my toenails. Seriously. Don't bother with this one, unless you are completely drunk and want to watch a stupid comedy."
3,US Civil War Children-tale,It is a children-tale of Afro-Americans fighting in the US Civil War for their liberty from slavery.Boring stuff is a bit dissolved with phisical abilities of Afro-American actors.
3,Silly Little Book,"I was hoping for something a bit deeper and with more substance. If you are just dating and stuff then this might be ok but if you are wanting to really find out if you are compatible, you have to ask a lot more really probing questions.I found 1000 Questions for Couples to be better book for us."
1,Horrible Book,"This is the most useless collection of questions in any book I've read intended for engaged or dating couples. The questions are very surface level, very superficial, and an entire waste of time. Who cares which snack food you like or what color carpet you want for your future home? This will not help you decide if the two of you are compatible. These preferences can change over time. This is all in addition to the fact that these questions are written from the perspective of a female, in feminine language, that is flowery and old-fashioned. I can't imagine your average male enjoying this book at all. I expected to find at least one good chapter in this book, but did not. I much prefer ""Don't You Dare Get Married Until You Read This!"" and ""the hard questions: 100 Essential Questions to Ask Before you Say 'I Do.'"""
2,Not a serious book for relationships,I bought this book in preparing for a more serious relationship. I would not recommend this book for those looking for a compatability test or questions that address the more serious aspects of a marriage.
1,never received product,I never received this product and I have to reorder it so I can get it. I am very disappointed in not receivng it. It is the first product from Amazon that I have never received. They said it was delivered but it never was sent to where I live.
4,Papa Was a Preacher,"The book was in very good condition. Years have faded the book jacket a little, but the binding and readable print are great. The story inside is still as fresh as the day it was written."
5,"come on, sing it with me: ""just what i needed...""","like new radiant storm king, this is a band whose music i have an unspecified need to love...only, the difference is that sportsguitar has never let me down. how i lived for three years unaware of this album when i *loved* sportsguitar's first two offerings so dearly, i haven't the faintest idea. they're a swiss band, but were on the matador label for those two releases, and this was on a different label, and there was little to no promotional effort put forth on its behalf. this is unfortuante, because it's without a doubt their most fully realized album. they ditched the lo-fi aesthetic, and while that saddens me a bit (they did it so well!), i can't argue with the results."
5,A good place to start,"This is a very readable & smart introduction to Keaton's early & best work.It's concise, articulate, clear--with reliable historical information & carefully considered observations about the films--all done in chronological order. The one hitch is that I believe it's been long out of print.I was patient & eventually lucky enough to find a copy in good condition for a reasonable price.It's a classic Keaton text & well worth waiting for. Thank you, Amazon."
3,Goldsworthy DVD is a little slow moving,I bought this for my high school art class. They were fascinated for the first 20 minutes. After that they lost interest. I thought Goldsworthy was much more exciting than this.
2,"Too much ego, not enough art","While I did enjoy several of the images of the final product and process, this film was disappointing. The processes and effects of change in nature are intrinsically interesting, but, in my opinion, this film devoted WAY too much attention to Andy Goldsworthy and not enough to nature and its interaction with his creations. I found myself fast-forwarding at 8x speed through much of the narration to get to the ""good"" parts. The quality of the DVD transfer was also mediocre (or maybe the original filming wasn't that good to begin with). There is no comparison to ""Winged Migration"" (5 stars)--at least not a favorable one."
2,Art?,"Oh man, I just sat through this thing...yes it's beautiful, yes it is 'ART'but listen to this guys explanations of his 'ART' man, man, I don't even know what to say...I guess the other 5 five star reviewers will be glad to tell me!"
2,"Loved the movie, hated the DVD","I saw this at the local art house and it was a fantastic experience. If you can see this in a theatre, do so. I'm sorry to report that the DVD is garbage. First of all, it's letterboxed, which isn't indicated on the Amazon page or the DVD packaging. But far worse than that is the quality of the transfer. It looks as if it had been dubbed off of VHS tape--low resolution, blurry, and exhibiting a ton of compression artifacts. I can't believe no other reviewers have commented on this. Save your money or buy one of the many books of his amazing work instead."
2,Fascinating documentary ruined by horrible DVD transfer,"As a few other reviewers have noted, this otherwise fantastic film is seriously compromised by one of the worst DVD transfers I have ever seen. While it might pass for watchable on a small TV screen, watching this on a big screen set will leave your eyes watering. The colors are flat and lifeless, details are blurry, and whenever the camera pans slowly across a landscape, as it does a a lot in this film, the whole image jitters and staggers."
2,Bad art ...,"I used to be an artist. ""Work"" like this is the reason I can't be associated with the scene any more. If there is any value to this movie, it is laughing at the ridiculous prattle of this guy describing his ""art"". The scenery is pretty at times. Spoiler Alert! Rugged guy braves the elements and arranges driftwood in a circle -- near another circle (which nature made - very profound). Or rocks. That's the general theme."
2,very disappointed,"From reviews online and quoted reviews from reputable newspapers I really expected good things from this. However, the film quality was very poor - just about the opposite of ""high definition"". The narration was patchy and conveyed little.Best thsat could be said of this was that it is ""whimsical"" - that is the most polite way of putting it that I can think of.Sam"
4,A Feast for Your Eyes,"Andy Goldsworthy is a brilliant installation artist. Most of his works are transient and subtle in their beauty. This documentry, narriated by Goldsworthy, shows the process and some of the beauty of his works. His materials are limited to the natural elements he finds on site, but not limited by his constantly evolving vision, as he manipulates rocks, leaves, drift wood and earth to create amazing art. If you are an artist or appreciate the creative spirit, you will be amazed and pleased by this film."
5,Beautiful and Inspirational,This video shows art at it's very core. It is way more than technique and materials. Andy Goldsworthy gets to the real purpose of art and the delicate relationship between earth and humanity. Brilliant!
3,DVD's format ruins some of the best parts,"I originally saw this movie on the big screen, and was so inspired by it that I decided I would buy it when it came out on DVD. I was extremely disappointed to see that my favorite scene, the icicle sculpture at the beginning of the film, was ruined because the producers of the DVD did not use letterbox format!!! The final shot of the sculpture was SO AWESOME!! This film is much better on the big screen. I do agree that the film gets frustrating when it spends time on the artist instead of on his art, but I really liked watching the artist at work when things are NOT working out as much as seeing successful pieces. It really gives me an appreciation of the full creative process to see the failures as well as the successes, and I recommend this film for that aspect.For those people who are disappointed by the film - try to see it on the big screen if it shows up in a film festival."
5,Rivers and Tides-an artist at work,"Andy Goldsworthy is an amazing artist and seeing him in action is incredible. He builds sculptures out of natural materials (stones, leaves, ice) and then waits for nature to do her part in the natural destruction of them. His books have pictures of both the finished product and sometimes the sequence either leading up to or after the sculpture is complete, but to see the painstaking process of building (not always successfully) is very impressive. Nice narration too."
5,This Movie Speaks for Itself,"I find it extremely difficult to comment on a work of art that speaks so clearly for itself, and that is precisely how I felt after watching this film. What is left to say? Only that this film moved me in an almost spiritual way. I knew very little about this artist before watching this film, and yet when I heard him describe his work, I felt as if he were speaking to me and me alone. I suspect many people who watch this movie will feel the same way. I don't know of a better definition of great art.Ken Harvey, author of ""if you were with me everything would be all right"""
5,Was exactly what I expected.,The item came right on time and in the condition noted. Pleased with the results from seller!
3,Average,"This item which was stated to be ""New"" was clearly a used product. The item arrived in packaging that was stapled and taped together to hold the cable inside. The cable does work but I would have liked new packaging or would have at least liked to know it was used before purchasing it. I kept the product anyways to avoid the hassle of returning it."
5,"Lyte ain't good, Lyte is great.","This MC Lyte album will continue to be popular many years from now as it stands out in wave of inspired early 90s rap. The jazz samples give it a timeless, historical, NY feel. Hard hittin' deep, belt-it-out style is something most female rappers aren't even capable of: MC Lyte is a phenomenon. The raps are printed inside - validate and affirm females - positive hard work, sexuality, not takin' sh**, and breaking out of destructive relationships. Tru: Ain't No Other like the Lyte."
4,Cool throwback....,"I don't really remember this album. Just the single ""Ruffneck,"" but I bought this CD for ""I Go On"" nice laid back tune!Love me some Lyte greatest MC of all time......"
4,Great for Sushi,"I live in a smaller town, and we don't have a wide variety of ingredients needed for making sushi at home. I took a chance and ordered this on Amazon. It works great. Delicious, very sticky, and makes excellent sushi. VERY sticky!"
4,Very Nice,I love sushi rice you can use it for anything. This particular brand has a different taste it seemed to me. But I loved it!
3,Did E. Lynn Really Write This???????,"Okay, I truly love E. Lynn Harris, I have all of his books and was really excited about this one. Well, after I got done reading, I was like, ""ummm, what happened???"" I did like Chauncey's character, but the story kind of left me hanging, it was truly boring, I hope he brings Chauncey back in future books, but I hope he let's his readers get to know Chauncey a little better."
4,A Breakthrough,"Chauncey Greer and Skylar aren't among the many and usually rugged athletic, E. Lynn Harris characters I had come accustom to, nevertheless I embraced them both and their humor. I especially identified with Chauncey's pain, disappointments, struggles and his belief and hope in God, which at times were under scrutiny by insiders and outsiders.Even when Chauncey was at his worst, God was still in control of his surrounding circumstances. His lost lovers, expectations of others and the burning desire to sing again came at a cost in ways unseen.E. Lynn did a incredible job; as usual, by keeping my attention and twisting the story in a way that caught me off guard.Kudo's E. Lynn for bringing back my 'BOY' Basil Henderson for a brief cameo. I was back in my element when I saw his name leap off the pages.Keep them coming my brother!Author, M.W.Moore"
2,Next Time I'll Do Better,"Everytime ELynn comes up with a new one and I rush to buy it, read and promise myself that I'll never buy another one...this one is no different...it's got such a sad undertone...Chauncey is weak as water...I did appreciate the way he brought back Yancey B..that part was refreshing and not predictable at all...at this point I'm not looking forward to the next ELynn work but I'm sure that when he comes out, I'll buy it..."
3,A little disappointed,"I was really excited to learn that Mr. Harris was back, but after I read this, I was left a little disappointed. This book didn't give me the same feeling that I usually get after reading his previous novels. He is truly an amazing author, but this one was not one of my favorites. But, I will continue to read his future novels."
3,Actually 2 and 1/2 stars,I love E. Lynn Harris! I own every book he's written and have been to all his book signings. This book was boring and seemed really personal. This is the worst book he's written. I still love E. Lynn though!
3,Review,"I laughed, and I liked the characters, however, I felt like an outsider looking in, rather than having a connection to the story. I enjoyed his commitment and joy to his faith, but feel a great book effects not only people who have been through similiar experiences, but those than can in some way identify with one or all of the characters."
3,Focus on the plot twists,"The novel follows the lives of Chauncey Greer and Damien Upchurch. Harris uses cleverly place flash backs to give the reader their history. As the story unfolds, the author includes a political and spiritual debate that is a hot topic these days: gay rights. Specifically, how does a homosexual or bisexual person reconcile their sexuality with their faith? Do gay and lesbian people have enough clout to effect change in the political scene? I found myself trying to ignore the characters sexuality and focusing more on the story and situations: lost love, career change, domestic violence, infidelity, and political ambition."
4,"Okay, okay- not the best, but its worth savouring","This is only my second E. Lynn Harris book, and I must say that the theme of queers in the black church is one that many authors could play with in the near furture a bit more. It's a very compelling and potentially controversial theme- ""Grade A"" soil for an earth-shaking novel. His tasty character development shows that this man is a ""Grade A"" writer. I love the humor that Harris weaves into the book, especially with the flamboyant and fabulous Skylar. The characters are four-dimensional and the twist are golden- up until the end. I don't think that Harris fumbled the ending, but rather ""juggled it"" too much. Other than the ""unexpected"" ending- Harris has given a taste worth savouring- Again!"
3,Not impressed,"I was anticipating this book because I am a huge E Lynn Harris fan, but I must say that I was so disappointed with this book. It started out so slow and just didn't keep my attention. It took me two weeks to read this book and I never take that long to read any book especially an E. Lynn Harris book. I suggest you save your money and borrow this or check it out from the library."
2,Pretty Sad...,"To put it simply, E. Lynn is capable of doing better than this. I have purchased each of his books and enjoyed them all immensely (except Not a Day Goes By), but this, this was just plain TIRED!!! Everything about this book was lacking. I just didn't like this piece of work."
4,Don't Miss This One!,"Having read all of Mr. Harris' prior novels I anxiously awaited this new endeavor. Needless to say, I was quite excited to finally get a copy in my hands. As in his previous works E.LH pleases his readers with a well written story with many strong characters. (There is even a visit from Basil Henderson and Yancey B for Harris' die hard fans). Many of the customer reviews already written on this page tell you what the story is about and they are accurate in their reporting. So I guess I will just tell you that you can't miss with ""I Say A Little Prayer"" or any of the other E. Lynn Harris books! A good solid quick read."
3,Not what I expected,"I was really excited to learn that Mr. Harris was back, but after I read this, I was left alittle empty. This book didnt give me the same feeling that I usually get after reading his books. He is an amazing author, but this one was not one of my favorites."
5,"""If the shoes fit, they yours""","I must say that this was a very unexpected read from E Lynn Harris. I really enjoyed the story of Chauncey Greer and his search for love and acceptance. The story is a quick read and you find yourself turning the pages faster wanting more.The story is full of colorful characters that will stay with you long after you close the book. E Lynn Harris did a great job of giving voice to a problem that I really haven't given much thought about until I read this book.I felt it was a well written, reflective tale."
1,"Those who can DO - those who can't TEACH...E.Lynn, make the writing sabbatical permanent!","I waited for this as if I was a child on Christmas day - and it was so disappointing. The store was a slow start, his characters were boring, his focus was lost (did someone else write this?) and much of what I read seemed like the ""pc"" thing to do now that he is teaching. I have been here front row from the very beginning, buying the books as soon as they arrived on the shelf- I should've saved my money on this one, and checked it out from the library, maybe then I wouldn't have been so disappointed...."
2,Just Okay Not really worth the Wait,Compared to his previous novels I expected a lot more from this one. This book was just okay and the plot really wasn't believable. I've noticed a definite change in his writing style with this novel. I hope he does better with his next novel
5,VERY GOOD COME BACK!!,"E.Lynn Harris introduced us to Chauncey who's going through life after a tough break-up with his first 'love'. Along the way you'll meet some of his closest friends who'll make you laugh, cry, and scream out-loud. Also, you're reintroduced to 2 of your favorite character from previous novels; I won't spill the beans; you'll have to wait and read :)"
4,Not as erotic as previous novels but...,"This book didn't seem to have the ""umph"" that the other E. Lynn books had but I still enjoyed it. Nice to see him bring in some of our favorite characters (Basil, Raymond, Yancy...)even with their appearances being so brief. Another good read!!!"
3,Prayer changes things,"I always enjoyed E.Lynn Harris books but this one left me......wondering where did I get off at.The characters were introduced but was cut-off when the action bagan to take place and left you wondering what did you really want to say.The obnoxious Bishop wife that wanted to sabotage Chauncey could have been developed with more vehement that will kept you panting for more..........Chauncey so he can sing but is not that a sterotype of the gay male within the Black churches......own a business and??? sing,played the organ, direct the choir, write music etc.....bring the house down because of the artist within.E.Lynn Harris redevelop the book and stop being afraid to let the characters get loose!"
4,Vivid Characterizations Make This a Worthwhile Read,"I always look forward to a new E. Lynn Harris release. I admire his ability as a writer and respect that he remains true to himself by exploring topics that some may consider controversial. He educates while at the same time, entertaining his readers with his uncanny ability to develop interesting characters that come alive on the pages of the book.The topic is sensitive, but one that can no longer be ignored. It's easy to pretend that prejudice within the church no longer exists, but for those who find themselves having to choose between being true to themselves or finding acceptance, the situation is very real. I like that Harris addressed this particular issue.I enjoy the way Mr. Harris weaves characters from his previous books into the storyline. There is a continuum in his body of work that creates an easy flow from book to book. I know there's more to this story, and I look forward to the next installment."
5,"Good read, great topic",This is one of my favs by E. Lynn Harris. He tackled the taboo but very relevant topic of homophobia in the black church and the religious and spiritual struggles of black homo and bisexuals.
3,Not His Best Work,"Compared to the other eight novels he has written - this one was not very good. I feel it was too sexually explicit. It's like he wrote this for his ""friends"" or something. Also, Chauncey going to the sex party and Chauncey's desire to live right before God -- Mr. Harris is sending a message that you can do what you want and still have a relationship with God. That's a wrong message and could possibly lead people astray. I know that God loves all of us despite our sins/weakness/flaws and accepts us just as we are - however, He does expect us to change and become more like Him. Homosexuality is a sin. Read this book but ignore the message that God condones this lifestyle -- that would be untrue."
1,Absolutely terrible,"I read 'The Sandy Bottom Orchestra', by Garrison Keillor and Jenny Lind Nilsson, a few months ago. It's a beautiful, witty book, and very funny. So, as you can imagine, I was delighted to find that there was also a movie version of it, and hastened to get it.What a disappointment! The movie was sappy beyond words--much of the humor was taken out and replaced with bad acting; it was entirely predictable. I was horrified. It seemed impossible to make hash of a book that thoroughly, but the director of 'The Sandy Bottom Orchestra' certainly did.In short: whether you have or have not read the book, do not see this movie. It is cliched and tiresome and it will not be enjoyable."
4,"Worse than some, better than a lot","A book-to-movie is not always easy and this movie has moments where it is not quite up to par with the book, but the underlying message still comes through. It is a great story of the things we do, whether we want to or not, for the good of the whole and also of the ties that bind. Plus, Glenne Headley is a stitch as the matriarch Ingrid. Anyone who has ever felt insecure or out-of-place will appreciate this movie (and be glad it's not your family!)."
1,"Nothing new, bad liner notes","This is the ""Now"" tracks from the ""Then & Now"" album.Unfortunately, the person who wrote the liner notes doesn't know the difference between Leonard Bernstein's ""America"" (from West Side Story) and Paul Simon's! He was also apparently unaware of the previous versions of ""Rondo"" that ELP recorded (i.e., at Royal Albert Hall).Get ""Then & Now"" and leave this one alone."
3,Sundial - 'Libertine' (Beggar's Banquet),"Looks to be the band's fourth effort.Sundial was,apparently a great little-known underground UK neo-psychedelic trio of the 90's.'Libertine' is okay,but I think I liked their 'Live Drug' CD(on the UK Acme label)better.Good luck in trying to find a copy of it.Well worth the search.Tunes here that sort of had me sit up and take notice were ""Watch You Smile"",""Everything You See"",""Dual"" and ""Star Baby"".Might appeal to fans of My Bloody Valentine,Lush,Flaming Lips and Bevis Frond."
5,I love this Book,I couldn't put this book down. The author had my undivided attention from the beginning. I felt as though she has walked in my shoes. I will definitely be buying this for all my girlfriends and other female memmbers of my family. I hope that we will be hearing more from this new author.
1,Blah blah blah,"I know Steve Heller's work and hence I was eager to read this book. But it bored me to tears, and I put it down after reading a couple of repetitive, overly personally detailed chapters. I think anyone who got this book thinking they'd gain real insight into how to become an art director and how to be an effective one will be disappointed. This was a poorly conceptualized book that is full of personal ramblings about various people who have been art directors."
1,Earring Review,"The earrings got in there in time and were packaged just fine. I was disappointed in the quality in that the green stones were very light not dark like in the picture. My daughter still likes them but, I would not purchase from this company again."
3,Come on they're $20 emeralds!,"Yes they are small, yes they are light, but come on they're $20 emeralds?! You can't beat that. MEN: Do NOT I repeat do NOT think you can buy these as a gift and get any credit. But if you're buying them for yourself or a child... they'll work. Still pretty and delicate and like I said, emeralds."
3,Just OK,"Like Sugarman's other books, this is a fast read that has some good anecdotes in it and not much to remember a day after you've finished it."
3,Don't waste your time,It is such a pain in the A** to do a boot replacement yourself. Just go buy a new axle and you're done.
5,A good one,I bought this for a friend of mine who is starting their own hair cutting business from their house right now. For the small amount of use it gets it does a good sharpening job.
3,Sharpening Stone,"I was a little disappointed with this when I opened it because I was expecting a much larger stone. I have some very large butcher knives that are a challenge to sharpen on this little stone, however, I made it work and my knives are back to ""scary status"" lol"
3,O.K.,"I ordered it for all of my brothers for Christmas. I never actually got to see the item, but they all called and thanked me. So I guess it got the job done."
3,Not too practical.,"As it turns out, this thing is not very practical for sharpening my clipper blades, which was the reason that I purchased it. To be fair, however, it is just a MANUAL sharpening stone -- It is what it is....I can't really knock it too badly."
1,DISSAPPOINTING,RECEIVED THE PRODUCT AND RETURNED IT IMMEDIATELY. IT'S A MINATURE OR MIDGET VERSION FOR SMALL KNIVES USE ONLY. DON'T BOTHER. A FULL SIZE VERSION WOULD BE GREAT.
4,Everything I expected,This sharpener is well made. Although somewhat small for large knives it performs adequately. Included extras (honing guide and oil) were appreciated and useful. I would recommend this item to consumers with basic knife sharpening needs. Might not be suitable for commercial use or large cutlery.
3,"There are better options out there, but they will cost you more.","Having sharp kitchen knives at my disposal has been an ongoing struggle. I have multiple hand-held sharpeners and a Chef's Choice, model 115, electric sharpener. All these devices got my knives sharp enough but not as sharp as I knew they could be. I already had a Smith's soft Arkansas stone so I thought I'd add this Tri-Hone sharpener and see what I could do by hand. My first impression was that it's a bit small. It works fine with shorter knives, but when I tried to sharpen my 10"" chef's knife or my 2 carving knives, the stones are just too short and narrow, making it much harder to keep those longer blades at the correct angle. I think this sharpening system was originally developed for pocket and smaller hunting/fishing knives and for that purpose is works well."
4,"Great sharpener, especially for the price!","I bought this knife sharpener for my boyfriend in December of 2008 as he is a chef and has great knives at home. He was beyond impressed with this system! It came with a little bottle of oil for sharpening. It is very simple and easy to use, even I have helped him sharpen knives (and believe me when I say, that is not my forte!). After 10 minutes of sharpening a knife it can easily cut through paper or a large leek without a problem. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish it had something on the bottom to hold it on a hard surface better, we usually have to put a towel under it and even then it's a bit awkward to sharpen. Still, this is highly recommended!"
3,A great product with a few draw backs,"This is a great sharpener. I would recommend it, but there are a few draw backs. I eagerly opened my new Tri-Hone sharpening stone system to find that one of the stones became unglued during shipping. I used super glue to repair it and haven't had any new problems. The sharpener doesn't come with a very sturdy base. I mean, the base is moving all over the place when you're sharpening a knife. I had to support it against the counter top to reduce its movement."
3,Ehh,"I purchased this for my knife set. I never would have thought how small it is. Though this being the case, if you will do fine with a small sharrpening stone it may be worth it. I gave it to my father, who has yet to use it in his shop but said it is worth keeping for a final sharpening."
5,Love,My son loves this. A great little surprise at Christmas! He was so excited to get it to sharpen all of his knives!
1,buyer beware,"When I opened the box I was angered because one of the stones had fallen off. This is absolutely unacceptable. I guess you get what you pay for. Don't buy this, one would be much better off with a DMT stone. It would do a better job and not come broken. I am upset I wasted my money."
2,not what I expected...,Its an ok sharpener... have had better... would I buy it again.. no I don't think sooI find the stones too rough an soft and porous....
5,Cant stop using it,"this 3 stone knife sharpner is the best! i have been looking at other models and this one is Way worth it. I use it on my kitchen knives and my specail fish knife.So far it has done the trick, great for the outdoors people.This is a must buy for everyone who owns a knife and likes to keep them clean."
4,Great all in one product,"I have to say this kit is really simple and requires a little practice to put an edge on your knives. I'm sure I'll get better the more I use it, but it is a great product."
5,Decent stones,"Nice set up. The base is heavy enough to keep the stone from sliding across the table as you work. The stones all cut well brand new, and seem to be holding up after several knives. Stones also work well with water instead of mineral oil, which saves a bit of time and moneyMy only (nitpicking) problems with the product:The plastic angle guide does not secure to the stone, and is smaller than the width of the stone. This is an odd choice and may cause beginners to miss the proper angle.The plastic guide and included mineral oil can not be stored securely in the base, which means I'll inevitably lose them. Seems like it would have been easy to expand the base slightly to hold these included tools."
5,Very nice,"This have a bunch of different sharpeners all in one for a great price. It also comes with information on what kind of blade status uses each stone rough and so on. A Must have,."
4,"no issues, just wish for non-slip base","No issues with the stones. The only thing I would change is putting some kind of rubber on the bottom of the base so it wouldn't move around when sharpening. I guess I'm probably push harder than I should, but a plastic base on a solid surface just is going to slip."
4,good,i have been looking for one of these for years and this was perfect for the house to fix all those great quality ktchen knives and a steel just does not work any more
3,Works OK,"The stones themselves are fine...their quality seems good and the stand holds still while you sharpen. The ""v groove"" underneath designed to catch oil and shavings is a joke - it isn't wide enough to pick up anything and might as well not be advertised as a feature. The real cheat here is the little plastic ramp they include to keep you on the correct angle. First, it is 23.5 degrees which isn't really standard for a kitchen knife (usually < 23.5 degrees) or a hunting/pocket knife (usually > 23.5 degrees). Even if it was right, it is smaller than a quarter and is essentially worthless. You are buying nothing but stones, a stand for the stones and the oil. Don't hope for anything else in the box to be of any use.That being said, with some care and a freehand approach, I've been able to put a nice edge on all of my knives. Now I'm searching for a honing guide that might work with this so I can do various angles."
2,Not what they used to be.,"The quality of this product has gone down dramatically over the years. I bought this item 24 years ago the first time and it was great. When I got it this time it was only one step above being pure crap!!! The stones were so cheap that they were bumpy on top, and the side edges actually crumbled away somewhat when used. the stones seem fake and manmade like corse porous cement. I guess it's a little better than scraping your knife across a brick. P.S. I also purchsed the 4 sided Dan's whet stone, it was excellent, like night and day. Highly recomend that one!!!"
3,Wrong hones description,"Good idea and well quality, but I expected to get two Arkansas stones and one coarse ceramic, mentioned in the info.But only one Arkansas stone in modern version! Others two hones are ceramic.Do correct description please!"
4,Good Design,"A good design, with stone concept excellent.What's Missing?The stone needs to be a little widerMost importantly: the angle setting assist device needs to be wider and thicker to allow easier grasp.Overall: excllent stone system for the price"
4,Not Bad For the Price,This was the first knife sharpening stone I ever PURCHASED. Previously I have always sharpened my knives (even my good kitchen knives Henkels)with the outside edge of my pizza stone. Sounds crazy but works great. I have a round pizza stone made of some kind of ceramic I guess) that I have used for 15 years for pizza and it has always doubled as my sharpening stone. I bought this set because the reviews seemed so great for the price - and frankly my pizza stone is only one grit and I wanted to try sharpening using different grits. As other reviewers have commented it is small but that just means you have to have better conrol and take your time. If you want a professional set spend more - if you want something decent and cheap that can work this is definitely worth the price. Beats using my pizza stone anyways (which works pretty damn good).
5,great stone,perfect stone to sharpen just about anything...love it way better than the kits you spend more on...recommend getting an extra fine stone for super sharp knives
5,Awesome Stone,I love this thing. It is big enough for larger blades. I purchased it to sharpen my clipper blades and it worked wonders. It is very easy to use and versatile. Great product. Very sturdy.
3,Seriously???,Immediately after opening up the box... CLANK!!! one of the stones completely fell off of the triangular peice.It looks like they attached this with elmers glue. Its just a matter of time until the other two stones fall off. If the stand were any flimsier it would buckle under its own weight. The bottom of the stand is plastic and slips along the table when you sharpen. Pathetic.Poor product design here. They might as well have just bundled 3 stones and sold them. It would work better than what they have now.The stones work fine which is the only reason I cant give this less stars.
3,"Nice, but a little small","Neat little product. The stones are a tad small, and are good for smaller blades....anything larger than a pocket knife would be difficult to get a decent edge on."
1,Low quality item,"All three stones on the item I received are not flat. Not only are they not level surfaces, the surfaces actually have bumps. This item would destroy a knife edge rather than sharpen it. Yes it is possible to flatten stones but you're better off avoiding this product all together.Also, it comes with only about 1 tablespoon of honing solution. How cheap! Don't buy more from Smith's, make your own, it's easy and you can find instructions online.Overall I suggest you avoid this product. I bought it trying to save money- instead I wasted money. If you're just looking to sharpen knives, take a look at the Spyderco Sharpmaker. Otherwise, if you are looking for something that can sharpen chisels and plane irons as well as knives, I suggest a course/medium DMT diamond stone and a fine Japanese waterstone. More expensive, yes, but you won't be throwing your money away."
1,Busted,"I recieved this package 2 days later than I was supposed to, the oil bottle was busted all over the box and I had to throw it away, and two of the stones were chipped!!"
4,Perfect for my needs,"This worked perfectly for what I needed. One thing I noted straight out of the box is that the plastic labels denoting the coarseness of the stones were mixed up and the fine was labelled as medium, medium as fine. No big deal really. Apart from that, works great.This was also 10 bucks cheaper at Amazon than at Lowes."
3,Adequate,"Stones are adequate to get you going on sharpening, but not much more. Also, mine came mislabeled like the other person's review. The medium marked stone was the fine stone and fine marked stone was the medium. I'm using it to sharpen wood chisels for now, but I can tell I will definately be purchasing larger and higher quality stones in the near future. Good basic sharpening system if labeled properly."
5,Smith's Arkansas Tri-Hone,Product is a very nice quality system. The somewhat small size is a problem with some knives but it is very usable. I use the fine side with WATER and it does bring the knife to a sharp level but NOT a Razor edge. You need a much finer grit to finish the knife in my opinion. All in all a very good product.
5,I'm digging it!,"This seems to be a very well made item. Very heavy too for it's size.. duhhh it has 3 stones!I sharpened my Katanas and various knifes on it, and they all came out very sharp. 3 stones of various grit. Mainly I use the 2 smoothest as the rough grit is for really damaged blades. Looks to be a long lasting item!PS: I also find it rather cathartic to sharpen my blades the old fashioned way vs the ceramic method."
3,"""shocked""","i ordered this for the price without the comprimise of quality and boy was i shocked this sender doesnt even ship the i power he said its just a default photo that millions use. but the one i received was a apollo hps 400 watt 53,000 lumens,2200k color temp. bulb is a good bulb perfect for a urban garden up to 4x4ft area. buy it love it."
3,So far so good,"Cholodin seems to be working well for my 17 yr old Shep mix. She started with the excessive circling, pacing, and dazed moments about a year ago. I started this supplement about 2 months ago and she does not seem to be advancing in her Cognitive Disorder. In fact some days she is better than before. I did not start her on the recommended loading dose in fear of the side effects, so I chose to use 1/2 the recommended daily dose for 2 weeks and then upped her dose to the daily amount. I had used Anipryl for a month prior to this, but due to the cost of this med. for such a large dog I decided to try Cholodin. Grant you I did not have her on Anipryl nearly long enough to see long term effects, but I did not notice a change or a deteriation in her congnitive state from switching to Cholodin. She is not getting any worse at this point and this is good. I would recommend trying Cholodin for early signs of Canine Cognitive Disorder... I don't know how well it will work for advanced stages."
5,Great Buy!,My vet recently suggested I start giving Cholodin to my dog. Buying in bulk (500 tablets) really saved money. Glad this product is available.
1,Patience & Communication,"I ordered Cholodin Canine 500 through Amazon who turned the order over to one of their affiliates, Entirely Pets.Product arrived within a week, but the bottle looked old and beat up and the pills smelled funny, so I called the Lab that manufactures the pills to see their date of mfg. They were two years old (already). So I called Entirely Pets, explained and was told that they did have six month old product they would ship. They shipped but the mfg date was the same as the two year old bottle I had already received. So either the re-order person or shipping forgot what the issue was.So called Entirely Pets again, they shipped me a label to return both bottles to them. That was a week ago, have not heard that they received product or that they have credited my account as promised. So we wait. Have spent entirely to much time on this ~ If it's not a product Amazon stocks themselves, I will not order anything again."
5,14 1/2 Year Old Aussie acting like a puppy again!,"Our vet suggested we start giving our old dog (14 1/2 yr old Australian Shepherd) this supplement to help her nervous system and overall health. Holy Cow! It took about 2 weeks but now she's running, jumping and acting like she's a puppy again. The vet said that some human vitamins contain Cholodin as well - I think I'm going to hunt some down for me!"
5,Great Product!,"My 13 year old dog was showing signs of ""doggie dementia"" (Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome). He was getting lost in our house, frequently stared into space and was up all night with anxiety-based insomnia. When he went outside to go potty, he would just stand there with a dazed look on his face, seemingly forgetting where he was or why he was there. He can't take Anipryl, a recommended treatment, due to possible interaction with his current medications. My vet suggested Cholodin and WOW-what a difference! His symptoms started to disappear within a few days. He's been on Cholodin for over 2 months now and all of the symptoms have disappeared except for a rare dazed state which surfaces every couple of weeks but clears up quickly. He didn't experience any side effects at all. I was devastated when his dementia was active and was afraid for the future. Now I feel like I have my old dog back!!!"
1,G-String Better Worn Than Played,"Despite having a nice rich tone, these strings refuse to settle-in and maintain pitch even after 3 weeks, the G string seemingly the worst of the bunch. Just when things seemed stable, the G developed a buzz because of a breakdown at the 3rd fret, signaling its final demise. Some 30 pound monofilament fishing line would be a better choice."
1,The Unraveling Reviews are True,"I expected better from Martin. I bought my strings at a local store, and they put them on for free, so I'm not going to return them, but in less than 2 weeks the G string at the 2nd fret started to unravel. It's also starting to split and unravel down at the 4th and 5th frets too. I will never buy Martin strings again because of this. I realize that these strings are a little more frail than guitar strings, but honestly, 2 weeks of moderate play? Unfortunately, these have lasted longer than the Aquilas, and that is WITH the unraveling. I went to play one day with the Aquilas on and the whole thing had just shredded about 5-6 inches down the fretboard. Is there any decent baritone uke strings out there???"
3,sound good but wear out fast,"I'm not sure if it is a common experience, however my g string lasted less than a month before it just outright had to go. Nothing ruins my day like a worn out g string. However I do have to say for the short while I had these strings they did have a great tone."
4,The wound strings are nice,I think there are few options out there for baritone ukulele string sets but these are the ones that I like to buy. They are pretty long lasting and they aren't too pricey. What I really like is the wound D and G strings. The regular nylon B and E strings are nice and smooth and they make even my little white wood baritone ukulele sound reasonably good.
4,"Great products, but don't believe the battery life claim!","I have had mine for about 4 months and overall I love them. The mouse is very comfortable and the scroll wheel is addicting. I have not had to replace the batteries in the keyboard, but I have been through about a half dozen sets in the mouse.So far, though, this is my only complaint."
5,I love my cordless keypad & mouse!!,Great quality and no cords!! What else could you ask for?!? Especially nice for homes/offices with right AND left handers - the mouse can be picked and moved to either side. I love this product.
3,Easy listening mixed with nostalgia,I love the Robin of Sherwood series and this CD has quite a bit of the incidental music used in that British 80's TV show. The rest of the music on the disc makes for good background when I am busy. I am not a fan of Clannad so can't comment on how this disc holds up to their other albums. But I like it enough to put it on the player a few times a year.
4,Lovely theme music,"This was a lovely album, but I would like to know how to get a CD of the ""Into the West"" soundtrack. That had a lovely theme in it, and I've been looking for it for years. Any suggestions?"
5,I'm a cat person,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a confirmed cat person. But a dog-loving friend who's never read my cat mysteries mentioned Susan Conant. Out of curiosity, I picked up THE WICKED FLEA. I think I'm hooked.Susan Conant tells a good story, and she tells it well. Her Holly Winter is chatty, opinionated, feisty, and downright likeable. I can't wait to devour another Conant book, rather like Kimi the Malamute and the rat-tail-infested french fries. [That's all I'm going to say about that particularly satisfying sub-plot].So, cat-lovers of the world, let's step for once out of our self-imposed cat-book limitations and read a GASP!! doG-centered book. It's worth taking the leap."
3,Some parts made me want to flee!,"This book is quirky and silly and for the most part was an enjoyable read. There were a few times when I couldn't help but roll my eyes because some of the elements were so ridiculous I was surprised they weren't cut from the book by the editors.I like that the author mentioned so many different dogs during the course of the book, but I thought at times that the main characters dog superseded her intelligence, which should have been insulting but I actually found delightful. I hate it when you pick up a book and the cover has a great picture on the front and the book never once mentions the subject on the cover. This book is definitely about the dog.I found the DOG related speech euphemisms a trifle annoying after the first few, Ex; ""For the love of doG,"" ""honest to doG,"" and others.This may not be the most serious of all murder mysteries, but it was a fun read for a couple of hours and over all I have to say I enjoyed it."
2,Loud and strong,"I would not recommend this unit. It's operation is loud, and it is so efficient that you can't put it on for more than 60 seconds or so. Save your money and use some other sort of diffuser."
5,dotes de actor,"Considero atinada la participación de Javier Solís en esta película, es divertida!"
4,Diwali,"A very easy and informative book to introduce young ones to Diwali,I read this to 4 year olds, and they all enjoyed it very much."
3,Great introduction but would have liked a lil more details,"I got this book as a gift for my 5 month old son for his first Deepavali. Even though, he can't read, I made an activity for all my nephews and nieces for the party. The book is a really short read. It covers basics such as what it stands for, why we celebrate it and how we celebrate it. I wish it would talk a little more about some things related to Deepavali like Rangoli drawings, and how different parts of India celebrate Deepavali and MOST IMPORTANTLY- its DEEPAVALI and not DIWALI!"
5,Nice Introduction to Diwali!,"I really am pleased how it approaches its subject matter. Most children's books about international holidays are too technical and long to be used as a read aloud. This book can be useful and provide useful information. If a student wants more they can read a more complex book later. It also helps include an ESOL child's holiday in class, even young kids."
3,"Too short and ""flat""","I was a little disappointed when I received this book. I was expecting something better after all the positive reviews. It is fine perhaps for some very young children but it is very ""boring"". I don't mind that it doesn't have lots of details but there is nothing engaging about it. It is ""flat"" - there's nothing interesting going on - it either needs a plot or else more detail - it fails as a fiction book and as a non-fiction book: it's a very short and boring synopsis of Diwali. My 2 and 4 year old were not engaged in it and they normally love to read and listen to stories."
2,Superficial and too short,"We've been reading to our now 7 month-old since she was a week old, and this book was way too short, and lacking any sort of depth at all. As a practicing Hindu, it was also a completely glossed over version of Diwali, with no coverage of the actual religious meaning of it! Very disappointed. A wonderful alternative is ""Rama and the Demon King"" - wonderfully illustrated, and captures the depth of the religious and moral parts of the story, while not being too long for a young one to handle."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book because our daughter married a young man from India whose family celebrates Diwali. This festival is as important to his family as Christmas is to ours. I wanted a simple, basic understanding of the celebration and so purchased this book. My son-in-law read it and pointed out some errors in fact in the Southern India tradition explained in the book."
4,Great book,"This was a great present for our 2 and 4 year old nephew. It's very basic, but good for a kid. It's bright, colorful, and it's simple to read. It would be ncie to have a follow up book with some more detail."
5,A review from a guy,"As a guy I never really 'cared' about what shampoo I used, as long as it cleaned my hair. But one thing I hate about my hair is that it curls. So I decided to find a shampoo that would hopefully fix that problem.This shampoo has done it, no more curls. Not only that, but my hair looks a lot nicer and feels nicer compared to other shampoo's I've used. As for the smell... it don't bother me. But it may for some men. It reminds me of a bubblegum smell, but it's not at the same time. It's hard to explain really, you would have to smell it yourself.I will be buying this again when it runs out!"
3,"not super straight, but good","I recommend this (and the conditioner) if you have a slight wave in your hair, not curly. It will make your hair silky, less prone to frizz, and somewhat straighter - you will, however, get super-straight shiny hair if you use this (and the conditioner) in conjunction with a straightening iron or blowdryer. I think I was expecting a miracle shampoo - just wash, condition and ""wha-la"" super straight! (any such product out there?)"
4,Don't call it a comeback....,"Wow, Common's ""Be"" is such a monumental comeback after ""Electric Circus"". For as much as ""Electric Circus"" sucked, that's how good ""Be"" is. This is truly a four or five star album.This is Common back at what he does best. Dusty, authentic, scratchy, old 70's R&B;/Jazz samples with straight-ahead rapping. Tremendous production from Kanye West gives us some of the best beats heard on a newer hip hop album.This has a great atmosphere to it, a tight compact theme. This is taking hip hop back a few years, but that's fine because there hasn't been a whole lot of outstanding hip hop in the last few years. This one sounds like it'll age nicely. Highly recommended."
4,Common the Preacher,"Common is the preacher of hip hop. He is a great rapper. My favorite songs are ""The Corner"" and ""Testify"". The Corner because the beat is amazing. I love the story in ""Testify"", about a wife who's husband is charged for murder. Then in the end, you find out that the wife commited the crime and framed her husband. This is only 4 stars because after the first 7 or 8 songs, I dont listen to the rest because it is boring.If you like Rockafella or Kanye West's music, I reccomend ""Be"" to you."
5,It's time to get some knowlegde,"It's time for people to come out of being dumbed down with pop hip-hop. Common beings the heat with this album. He is socially conscious and we are missing that today in main stream music. That is the beauty of this album. It's not about how much money I got, or how many hoes I have, or my houses and cars and partying, ect... It's about real life and Common skillful and eloquently delivers. For example, ""Corners"" gives us the state of being black and poor in America. The production is excellent, Kanye did his thing. But don't make the mistake of thinking Kanye's production is what made the album. His production added spice, but Common is the sustenance, the core entre'. Go buy the album and be refreshed."
4,FUTURE CLASSIC TRUE HIP HOP,"IN THIS TIME AND DAYZ OF GARBAGE HIP HOP (50,EM ""ENCORE ALBUM"", 95% OF THE SOUTH MUSIC, AND THE ALOT OF THE EAST COAST RAPPERS THAT TRY TO SOUND LIKE SOMEONE ELSE). THIS ABLUM IS A BREATHE OF FRESH AIR. THE ONLY FAULT IS THAT IT'S TOO SHORT 46 MINUTES. RIGHT NOW WE NEED MORE REAL HIP HOP SAY 60, 70 MINUTES LP INSTEAD. I GOT NOTHING TO CRITIQUE ABOUT THIS ALBUM. HOW EVER THIS IS A VERY STRONG EFFORT BY COMMON COMBINING""RESSURECTION"" AND SOME ELEMENTS OF ""ELECTRIC CIRCUS"" LPS. ALSO LOOK OUT FOR ROOKIE PAPOOSE, STYLES P, LITTLE BROTHER AND REDMAN NEW ALBUMS IN THE 2QUARTER, 3QUARTER"
3,Great On Today's Sliding Scale,"This album has been more hyped than the last episode of Friends. Before it even came out people were calling it a classic. Well, the first time I skimmed through it, I was ready to agree. But then as I listened to it more, I grew less exciting, and now I can safely say it is a good album, but not a classic. These days, it seems that a hip-hop album with five good tracks is the best the industry can do, and by those standards, this is a great album. But I like to think that hip-hop can do better. The Corner and They Say are great songs, but the entire album does not live up to their examples. I'm sure this will still be one of the best hip-hop albums of the year, but that doesn't mean what it used to."
4,"Its a good album, not a classic!","I like this album, but I just wished that it had a few more tracks! I'm not a big fan of Kayne West, but he didn't get on my nerves like he usually does with he is involed on a track or album with another artist. I liked every song on the album excepted for the the intro. I feel that it was one of the best albums that Common has done in awhile. I wouldn't call it a classic, Common is not done yet!"
4,Great 3/4 of a CD,"Had to see what folks were saying about this one,I have mixed emotions. Hope my review helps someone out there. The CD has great,jazzy music w/ good rap(Common has a great hip-hop voice/vision). But, just when you start thinking this is a really good CD it's over. This CD was made way to safe! 40 minutes, isn't that a demo (when the disc holds up to 72 minutes)?"
4,Chicago-ing,"I got my first listen of The Food off of season 2 Dave Chappelle's show. I knew then I'd be adding Commons' BE to my sizeable list of CD's.Common is a very good-looking brother. Amazingly, that isn't even the GRAVITY of this dude. His words are so rousing, all HEART & SOUL!I've never owned a COMMON CD before. You know me, I have to stand out and represent for ""my town"" SHOOT I didn't walk I ran in support of one of ""Chi-town's FINEST!"""
3,Common get more 11 tracks,Common has been said to be a good rapper. That is he is . he's album gets 3 out of 5. I wish more tracks than 11. I have better ways to spend 14.99 then on it. good tracks:Testify and Real People.
1,Overhyped and overrated,"I listened to this CD with an open mind I personally thought it was a failure in every way possible. The beats on here are weak by Kanye's standard and Common's performance was really bad too. Not to mention the song ""Go"" was incredibly annoying and is most certainly one of the worst songs of the year. The only good song was ""Testify"". I can understand why people would like this as an alternative to the booty and gangsta rap acts of today but it's not a good alternative. If you want a good rap album that's not gangsta or booty get ""Late Registration""."
2,What is the big deal with this cd.,My friends nick and matt love this thing. What is the big deal . I guess i jus dont feel common that much. THe cd is like 2 seconds long . He has no point to his rapping liek people rap about there hard life or w.e . He jus rymes big ass words for the hell of it i dont get it . THis cd should be called Kanye west presents some clown with a beard the whole cd is all Kanye . The food is a good song tho. Kanye mad funny on the chorus . Idk if u like common get it but idk y people clal this a classic
1,Inferior encoding quality,"I have used free ffmgeg4 for a while to get movies for my son on the road on Sony PSP. Purchased Popcorn 2 in hope it will provide more convenience with chapter/features selection.Found, that while encoding with the same bitrate/size constrains, Popcorn produces junk results on my PSP compared to ffmpeg4 - pixelated squares all over the screen. No convenience in selecting the screen ratios and sizes - like ""Autoselect best settings for that movie on the selected device"". Waste of money, unless you want to buy and carry tonns of SD cards around to encode with higher rates. But then, factor in the price of SD cards.The bottom line - no expected convenience, awful quality."
5,Pretty good new software for copying movies onto the iPod.,"I've been using Popcorn 1 for a couple of years now, but when I received an iPod for Christmas I updated to Popcorn 2. It does a great job! Of course the screen is pretty tiny, but you can't beat it if you're stuck waiting in some office, or for viewing on the bus or train."
4,Great product with one kink,"I bought this program for my new iMac and have been very satisfied. The only thing that disappointed me about this product was that it cannot copy copyright-protected dvds. However, all I had to do was download the free program MacTheRipper and in combination with Popcorn 2 I am able to easily duplicate my whole dvd collection for backup purposes. Other than that it's been good. You don't get a ton of conversion control so I just use Handbrake, another free program. For the purpose I bought this, to copy my homemade dvds, it works flawlessly. Highly reccommended."
3,Superfluous.,"No way this program is worth the asking price. It comes, along with Spin Doctor, as an added-on feature of Roxio's Toast, which doesn't cost much more than Popcorn 2 alone.As for Popcorn, its uses strike me as limited--compressing any long (legal) video file sufficiently to allow it to fit on a single DVD. But when I have used it, it has proven to be one of Roxio's more reliable products. Moreover, it's exceptionally user-friendly."
1,What exactly does this program do?,"I bought this thing, thinking it was something else entirely, installed the doggone thing, and have found that it does absolutely NOTHING that my Mac is not capable doing with the software that came on the HD for FREE. Of course, now the package is open, and there's not a chance of returning it. Completely worthless."
5,Popcorn 2 even better than the original,Roxio took an already great DVD copy product and made it even better. I bought the original Popcorn when it first came out and have had nothing but success with it and this new version. Installing and using it is completely Mac-like simple. It even spurred me to buy the pc version for my laptop.Now I've got the best of both worlds. I can back up my DVDs and also convert them and store a bunch of them on my Mac's hard drive so I can use the Front Row software to watch them full-screen with my new Intel iMac remote. Plus I can put them onto my iPod to watch when I travel.A great product that takes advantage of Apple's hardware options.
1,This product is worthless!,"I have the new macbook pro and this product will not burn anything, it continues to show errors. I have wasted a lot of DVD R's because of this product. It is slow and is supposed to be universal with the my mac. However, this product does not work. In addition, I have had no luck getting in contact with their support center. There is none!"
1,"Be prepared to request a refund....PS, there's awful customer service","This program doesn't seem to work for many people. Be sure to read some of the online forums describing problems. Mine was: ""could not complete the last command because of a MAC OS errorerror code = -5"". This occurs when copying from a Video_TS folder... what you have to do when you have only one cd drive (iMac). Customer support was some of the worst i've ever experienced; the whole gamut: bad english, accusing me of trying to violate copyright, short non-sensical solutions: ""change permissions"" and then closing the help ticket without resolution. Do yourself a favor a buy a different program. Many people recommend ""Toast"", also from Roxio. i am cautiously thinking about trying it. Overall i'd have to say the best thing to do is to email/call Roxio to ensure that the program will do what you want and expect it to. Good Luck."
4,Easy to use but could be better,"a fairly simple program to use. i would like to change and add some features. I like DVD2xOne but bought this becuase it was $10 less. With Popcorn you cannot save a compressed image file of your DVD to your hard drive, only a full size disc image."
5,inspiring,"This is a must read book. The 26 short stories are great as a holiday gift and wonderful for sharing with those you love. The stories are inspiring, uplifting and generate thoughtfullness for the reader. After reading a story you turn inward to examine your own feelings and thoughts. The book is written in a charming manner that brings each character alive. Everyone can associate with the life choices that are made in each story, for we all face the same life challanges. A wonderful addition to reading the book is the detailed art work. Each picture is beautifully done and enhances and completes the written words. Enjoy! Enjoy! Enjoy!"
5,Fabulous,"Having read several overly cheerful, annoyingly personal ""I had an ED, and beat it, and you can to!"" books, it was amazing to find a simple, objective, yet far more true understanding of women with EDs and how they recovered. It's a pretty dense book,so not for the reader who wants to breeze through a self help book in an hour, but well worth the time and effort."
5,I Never Thought Life Could Be So Sweet!,"From the beautiful opener to the excellent cover of Bizarre Love Triangle at the end this is a wonderful album full of mellow catchy songs. I think of it as an album to listen to late at night because of the enchanting quality and Angie Hart's vocals but it has some upbeat songs and makes for great listening anytime. The only misstep on the album is when the guys sing parts on a couple of songs. They are not bad singers but Angie's vocals are so joyful to hear that you wish they weren't cutting in. Those aren't bad songs though, in fact there isn't a bad song on this album, and some are absolutely stunning. No doubt to me this was one of the best albums of the nineties. I've been lucky to have these songs bouncing around in my head for over a decade now, my life has definitely been sweeter as a result. If you haven't been so lucky I suggest you start making up for lost time."
1,Horribe!!!,I bought it due to its high rating but i found it to be absolute rubbish ive not heard a worse album i was very dissapointed and threw it in the bin!!
5,A wonderful album,"I bought this album because I wanted to listen to the marvellous version of New Order ""Bizarre love triangle"". But I was amazed when I listened to the rest of the album. When you listen to the voice of this girl, you really feel as if you were in heaven.Believe me, this is an incredible album."
4,"This CD transports you to a fun, carefree ""la-la land""...","The gentle vocals on this CD always take me back to the sweet times in my carefree youth. These fun, rhythmic, well composed tracks will have you skipping through the park, smiling (with or without your lollipop). If you're in the mood for a taste of ""Candyland"", this CD was made for you. Enjoy!!!"
4,Marvin?,The two covers of New Order classics on this CD are worth the price of the whole thing. The rest of the tracks are good solid coffeehouse style accoustic rock. A beautiful voice.
4,Can something be breazy and profound?,"This recasting of Bizarre Love Triangle feels both heartfelt and removed. As if the song matters to the teller, yet she needs to stay detached.The entire album plays this way, light and very easy to listen to, with a simple sincerity that begs a closer listen.Accidently Kelly Street plays like a wispy single, sounding more like color than music, playfully simple, almost silly, but a delight none-the-less.Fun, light but with depth, this a great album for a windows down drive in June."
5,Finally!!! I found this!!!,"I've been searching everywhere, in and out the web for some info about ""Frente"". I first heard a song called ""bizzare love triangle"" in MTV and ever since I've been looking for this cd and no music store seems to have it. I'm soooooooo glad about this!!! Thanks a million!! New album???"
5,Easy to recommend these wrenches.,GearWrench makes great ratcheting combo wrenches for a affordable price. They require less room to move to the next ratchet click than other brands which makes them great for tight places. I bought this wrench to use in replacing the rear shocks on my Mercury Grand Marquis which has almost no space to access the top nut. This wrench worked well and the extra length was essential to reach in far enough to get to the nut. I hope to pick up a complete set before too long.
1,wrong picture or item,The picture that is on this item is NOT the right item......the part number is for a BTX cpu cooler. The picture posted is NOT a BTX cpu cooler. Don't know if want to buy this item or not. Bad for selling.
1,This book is plot-free.,"Unless you really like detail that goes on and on and on, and situations where nothing ever actually happens, and jumping around in time and space with no explanations, and in general being utterly confused, don't buy this book. All that stuff in the professional reviews about her writing style is just a nice way of saying you'll only like this book if you're an academic into experimental forms of writing. There's no perceptible plot, and I never found a reason to care what happened to the main character. I couldn't even finish the book. My advice: don't bother."
3,Spring Days,"Absolutely loved the drama. However, couldn't read ""white"" subtitles when words were shown against white doctor's coat, or light background."
2,Dissapointing CD from an amazing voice,"I didn't enjoy this CD at all. I am a Huge fan of Crystal Lewis' music and voice, but this children's project left me unimpressed."
2,I only watched part of it.,I only watched part of it because that was all that I could get through. Bette Midler is only in it for a few minutes.
2,OK But Could Be Better,"The only reason why I bought this movie is b/c one of my favorite actresses~Bette Midler~had a role in it. I had already seen the film at the show and I liked it a little. The film is not your average. There is alot of campiness and just bland humor. I mean it is not really funny. It is more sick with people getting their fingers chopped off and everything. I was surprised that so many top rate actors starred in this movie like Casey Affleck, Danny DeVito, Neve Campbell, Jamie Lee Curtis and Bette. Overall, a decent movie. It's supposed to be a ""mystery"" but only buy if you are a fan of any of these stars or just like campy movies."
2,Not bad,"Not a bad movie. Not the best, but good for a few laughs. Some of the acting is certainly questionable, but all the stars do just fine.Better Midler plays Mona Dearly, a crude, rude, short-tempered know-it-all who's hated by just about everybody in town. When she dies to obvious foul play, just about everybody she knew had a motive. Danny DeVito plays the small-town sheriff who gives it his all to do his job right. DeVito is the bright spot in this movie. Bobby was an endearing character but Casey Affleck, although he does give a lot of effort, is a terrible actor. Everybody else did a fine job."
1,drown this movie!,"This is one of the worst films of this year. Thank god I at least waited til it was on video. This was a huge waste of talent and film. I don't know what some of these actors where thinking when they decided to be in this movie. Also, it wasn't even funny. I can't believe someone actually read this script and thought it would be a good film.Take my advice, and leave this one on the shelf."
2,Ops Miss Midler,"Ok, I so deprest. This Film bringing me down. Miss Midler whats going on with You???? Ok next in German. Also dieser Film ist leider nicht auf dem Standard den wir von Miss Midler gewöhnt sind. Die wenigen Szenen in denen Sie zu sehen ist sind zwar ganz passabel, aber im Großen und Ganzen ist dieser Film für mich ein Flopp.Die Langeweile plagt einen. Kein Pepp, kein Witz und Mr. DEVITO ist auch nicht mehr das was er mal war."
2,Ding Dong the witch is dead,"Well, how bizarre was that? It was pretty bizarre. It's one of those alternative kind of films you like to see every now and then, just to realise how bizzare it is.There were actually a few laughs included, but you sort of don't know what to think, so you just sit there with a puzzled look on your face. It was good how everyone's stories conflicted so much, and were so biased, that you knew everyone was full of carp.Danny Devito didn't make use of his sense of humour, but SNL's Will Ferrell did, so that wasn't too bad. Casey Affleck was quite irritating but I guess he was meant to be. See this film if you don't feel like seeing attractive or smart people on the big screen!"
1,please stop!,Relentlessly horrible! Do not waste your time with this one...I like most of the actors in this movie....I do not know what went wrong...Stay away! You've been warned!
2,Drown this One Please,"Except for Danny DeVito this movie is hideous. I love most of the actors here (Will Ferrel, Bette, Jamie Lee Curtis, and the brilliant William Fitchner) but what there stuck with is [weak], overlong, and pointless...a shame because this movie could have been fabulous. As Charles Taylor said this is Danny DeVito's movie...he's such a marvellous presence here.....watch it if only to see Danny's performance"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"To be succinct, ""Drowning Mona"" is the worst movie ever...worse than ""Gigli""...Worse than ""Cabin Fever""...Worse than any movie with Tara Reid or Paris Hilton. Better to sip cyanide than watch this horrid (unsuccessful) attempt at black comedy."
5,Love it!,Great movie! It's just that It remindes me of another Danny DeVito movie which I can't think of right now but this has to be in your movie collection . When I went to see it at the movie boy I didn't think it was going to be that good. If their is one movie to buy this year is have to be this one for so many reason that I would never end this review. So take what I say and buy it to see how good a movie really is.
1,Drown this movie,"What a dissapointment!!!! I never purchase a movie before I see it at least once. I thought becasue it had an all star cast that it would be very very good. WRONG!!!! I love Midler, Cambell, Curtis, and thought they were all misscast!!! I am a fan of dark humor but this one is pitch black!!! I had to see this movie to get at least some of my money back. I guess that I was following it until about the last 20 minuts of the show. Then it went to a totally different direction that was full of wine and cheese. {more cheese than wine} very sad movie that is supposed to be a comedy!!!! Skip this one you will be glad that you did."
5,THE Funniest Video,"After I left the theater from this movie, I was trying to remember all the funny things that happened. This is how funny that movie was. Drowning Mona included some very well-known actors and actresses who played different roles in this comedy, which made it all the more enjoyable. Even though this movie did not do too well, I think it was a very funny movie that will keep the viewer interested. I know I am going to watch it plenty more times."
1,Dipper's How To Survive This DVD Guide,"Drink huge amounts of swill before (especially before), during and after this strong, strong candidate for worst movie of all time. My right thumb fingernail still hurts from trying to scratch all of the label paint off a Rolling Rock bottle while watching this horrific flick about Yugos. The only fleeting moment of joy in this dud was watching that harridan Bette Midler get bumped off literally. Oddly, I had a thought about my old girlfriend just then. Read the first sentence of this review again 24 times (that's one fine case) and your waiter The Dipper suggests a fine hefe-weizen for these hot days with a twist of lemon. 24 times. Get swigging, then get watching."
2,"Not that Bad, Not that Good.","Not as bad as some people have made it out to be but it's not as good as some people had made it. The whole movie is really one very long joke, that has some very funny parts in it. Most of those parts really belongs to Neve Campbell, who steals this movie with her great performace, and William Fincher, who's performace as Mona's dead beat husban had me rolling in my seat. Other than them, Most of the actors realy don't come off that well, and the movie itself stalls about half way in.It's a good rental, that's all."
3,"Floundering a little, but definately not drowning","Although this ovie was not great it wasn't bad either. the movie moves sluggishly from the start to the end, and i never really got into it. However the characters in this make it worth a rental. Every person in this town is nuts, in some way or another, alos the majority of them drive modified and origional yugo's. THis makes for a quirky cast of characters who are fun to watch. THe actors do a good job of brining the charcters their own individual personalities. The movie itself, is predictable enough, although there are a few twists, and the jokes are good for a quick laugh. THe disc itself looks good and sounds fine. THe extras aren't spectacular with teh usual bios, and trailers, and dumb deleted scenes. So if you like quirky movies with some quick laughs,give mona a shot, but you might wanna wait for it to become a cheap-o rental."
2,What happened?,"I don't understand what went wrong with this movie. You take a really talented cast a very funny premise and you come up with this. Mona Dearly was hated by all. Everyone has a motive, But it's not that hard to figure out Who really did it. With all of the characters this could have been a lot more fun. The ending is absolutly tacked on as if to say it was reshot later and tacked on to try to save a confusing mess, Which isn't that confusing. All in all Drowning Mona Is not Terrible but a huge dissapointment. The Disc itself has some good extra stuff,but wouldn't it be nice to say that about the film?"
4,"A bad film, but odd enough to keep me watching","I've watched this movie a number of times, and there are a quite a few subtle jokes that keep me from turning the channel. The whole Yugo gag is hilarious, and frankly, Bette Midler is irritating enough for even the viewers to have zero sympathy for her death!"
2,Not all that funny,"Great cast, somehow not quite either with the material, or the material wasn't for them (probably not for anybody for that matter). The Yugo joke gets old pretty fast. That's about the only funny thing I remember in the film.Black comedy can be funny, but this film just wasn't funny."
5,So funny!!!,"I love these type of movies, it's like off beat, cheap looking, but crazy good, movie.I saw part of it on TV, it looked like it's funny, so I bought it here on Amazon used for less then $3, and I love it! It's one of my all time favorite movies"
5,Fabulous Movie,"I must admit I was shocked to see other reviews of this movie. How could anyone not absolutely LOVE it??? The only people I know personally who did not like this movie hated it because it hit too close to home! Maybe that's the case for the reviewer who cannot distinguish Yugos from Hugo (9/21/1989 Hurricaine). Will Ferrel, Jamie Lee Curtis, the Divine Ms M, Danny Devito all portrayed entertaining and colorful characters for side splitting laughter. ""Jeph"" Dearly's maming was priceless. I could go on and on .... And what about that soundtrack!!! Awesome all the way around. If you want to see a movie that will leave you rolling with laughter, this is for you."
2,ALL THAT STAR POWER COMES TO THIS...WHAT A SHAME,"I LOOKED forward to this movie from the first time I heard about it and saw trailers and read plotlines. I didn't expect a movie this bad. It's amazing that with such gifted actors and actresses (Midler, DeVito, Campbell, Curtis, etc.) you could have a movie this disappointing.How exactly does ""Drowning Mona"" disappoint?I love the stars.I love the plot.I love everything about this movie except, well, this movie. A basically good script idea and all these big named people somehow fizzled into a blandly acted, and worse, only mildly funny ""comedy.""There are a good number of better comedies than this out, many of which didn't receive as much attention. It's not really THAT bad, but it's definitely much worse than what you would expect. At least if it's going to have a go-nowhere plot, you can have a few big laughs to make up, and ""Mona"" doesn't offer this.2/5."
1,This movie sucks.,"I figured that with all those big named stars, this movie couldn't be that bad. Boy was i wrong. This was by far one of the stupidest, most wasted space on the video store shelf movie. One or two parts were mildly entertaining but you'd get more laughs from an episode of Friends. Definately a dumb-waste-of-$4- if i ever saw one. Ugh,terrible movie."
1,I really envied Mona - she didn't have to watch it.,"This movie is more than bad - it is a serious insult to the consumer, somewhat like selling Firestone tires, Pintos, or maggot-infested meat. It is not remotely funny and the tired visual jokes only provoke a feeling of embarrassment for the actors involved in this turkey. Unfortunately, I watched this movie one week after viewing Magnolia, another waste of time. These two movies have degraded contemporary film writing and direction more than Ed Wood could have ever done in his lifetime."
4,"oh, mona dearly . . .","trust me, i was not expecting much when i rented this movie, but to say i was pleasantly surprised is an understatement. the entire cast is fabulous and they play off each other expertly. standouts include the terrific danny devito and bette midler doing their thing, but william fichtner and neve campbell also are excellent. my personal favorite is casey affleck in a blonde wig, playing a mild-mannered landscaper with a darker side. his wide-eyed innocence is hilarious, and i loved his character"
4,A Great DVD!,"""Drowning Mona"" is a great DVD. The special features are good, and it's a very funny movie. If you like special features and you love great comedies this is a must-buy!"
3,great book OK movie,The book is great--and the movie tried with great cast costumes and music and it might have been a four had I not read the book. YCNTABBIM you can never tell a book by its movie. Still enjoyable but read the book!!!!
2,poorly adapted,Beautifully photographed but they simply put the words of the novel's narrator into the various character's mouths. The reult being awkward and clunky dialogue which even good actors couldnt make sound real
2,Great to look at but bad script,"Thornton Wilder's book ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey"" won a much deserved Pulitzer prize. The book was about the kinds of love, our interconnections with each other and fate. This film is terrific to look at, the sets and costumes alone make the film. However, the story which made the book such a delight has been sliced and diced so that the wonder of the story telling has very literally been lost in the translation. I found it very difficult to development any sympathy for the characters that I so loved in the book, which is sad since the first rate actors playing the parts had a very difficult script to work with. This is the second adaptation of Thornton Wilder's book. Hopefully, the third will be the charm."
1,MEDIOCRITY AND STALENESS AT ITS WORST!,"DEFINITELY PUTS YOU TO SLEEP. If you are looking for a super boring plot, sloppy acting, an uninspired cast, horrible music, and a story that will literally put you to sleep this is the movie. I bought it thinking I would be entertained, instead I ended snoring and when I woke up I was mad at having wasted good money to purchase this literal piece of crap.... It's one of those movie that make you wonder why its producers could not find something better to do. What a terrible waste of film! Mediocrity and staleness at its worst. It just goes to show that sometimes you cannot rely on movie trailers to help you decide if a movie is worth watching. Is there a word to describe ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey""? Yes: BARF!"
4,Recommended!,"The film is out of the ordinary. It needs a lot of concentration or watch it at least twice. The essential in this film is the discussion. First, the film shows a time in history: The Inquisition, adapted brilliantly to the 1700's. Second, 5 different lives that could exist in the pass, present of future. And third, the thoughts of Brother Juniper about divine intervention vs. arbitrary probability in the bloody disaster. The film is a philosophic analysis of the live sense."
3,Book or movie?,"Although I appreciate the great stars that were cast in this movie and the tremenous work done with tradional clothing and scenery several centuries ago it did not impress me as much as the book. I read The Bridge of San Luis Rey in my freshman year in high school and I never forgot the power of it - so I just had to see the movie. The ending of the movie is really well done, but the mid section was a bit boring. I would recommend you read the book if you have already seen the movie. It is much more full of moral values, faith and fate of mankind."
1,Read the book instead,"I read the book many years ago, and thank goodness, because this film is confusing and incoherent. Without knowing the basic story ahead of time, it's not always clear what is happening or why. Even when you do grasp the meaning, you never really care about any of the characters or understand what is going on in their lives. All in all, a sloppy, uninvolving version of what should be a gripping, moving tale. Buy a copy of the book and read that instead. You'll get much more out of it."
2,dont waste your time,Dont waste your money. Go for the Ipod. This has too many updates and bugs in it.
2,Not exactly pink,"Cute little guy, but the ""pink rose quartz"" pendant is more white than pink. The photo is misleading. This was a gift for a friend; if we'd had more time we'd have returned it and asked for a different, brighter color."
3,sad,"the movie was good, it was a different perspective on film then i have seen in zombie movies it made me think.."
3,It was okay.,"This short movie was the very definition of ""Short"". The special effects were lacking, to say the least. However, overall it had a decent story-line which made it acceptable. I can't really say that I'm disappointed...it's worth a watch or two."
3,Not Bad for a Short Film,"This short film wasn't all that bad when compared with some of the zombie turkeys that are for rent here on Amazon.com.You could do a lot worse than this--believe me, I have rented some pretty worthless zombie films here."
4,Excellent Bette Davis Performance in 'A Stolen Life.',"'A Stolen Life,' deals with Twin Sisters Kate and Pat. Kate loves Bill. Pat Steals Bill from Kate. Pat and Bills marraige is in shambles. Kate and Pat go sailing and there is a terrible storm out at sea. One of the sisters die. The one that survives pretends to be the other. Bette Davis plays both sisters with much gusto. Loved it!"
3,it's 40's camp,"Come on now, there was a war on or just over and Bette had to give her audience some new thrills. You get TWO for the price of one! Yes, it is a bit unbelievable, but this was 40's Hollywood. Escape was the keynote and this one has it in spades. Besides, as a trailer said for anothe Davis flick: ""There's nothing so good as when Bette is bad!"" Ford is an American slice of apple pie and the light house is great. Relax and have a real treat. They don't make em like this any more cause we ain't got those Bette Davis eyes today."
3,Very poor quality VHS tape,"I wish now that I'd spent the extra money and gotten the DVD of this movie as the VHS version is very poor. It is very dark all the way through and appears to have had very little or no restoration at all. It's a good story and, of course, Bette Davis can't give a bad performance. I disagree with some reviewers comments about Glenn Ford. I think he is perfect in this role and did a very good job with the little he was given to do. He was very believable. For anyone thinking of ordering this movie, go ahead and get the DVD. I'm sure it must be much better quality than the VHS tape."
3,Two for the price of One!,"My first film book was purchased in 1945. `Film Preview of 1946`. The first film mentioned, as a big forthcoming attraction was `A Stolen Life`. Now, after all these years I finally have a copy. It is not a bad film, nor is it a super film. Bette plays the identical twins. One not bad as in wicked, but more thoughtless and spiteful. The other twin is of course, kind, gentle and undemanding. Glenn Ford is the kind twin`s find and she keeps him away from her sister for as long as possible. Inevitably the thoughtless twin takes over, and then marries him. The kind twin carries on with her life as best she can. There is plenty of drama and action to follow.Bette has a very large wardrobe as she plays the twins. She wears trousers quite often. Quite daring in those days I think. She and Kathryn Hepburn are the women we have to thank for getting us out of skirts and stockings and into the much more comfortable trousers we wear today.A real old fashioned melodrama."
5,Bette Davis at her best!,"This is truly, one of Bette Davis' best films. She really shines in it. They certainly don't make them like this anymore. She does a good job playing a double role as Katie, and her sister Pat. It's a story, that really keeps your interest. I really like the New England setting in this film. It takes place in a little town near the ocean in Maine I highly recommend this. This is a kepper!"
5,a stolen life amazing:,"i had tried several times to get this movie on dvd and could only get it on vhs . now i have it on both vhs and dvd . this movie is truly an amazing display of bette davis""s acting . doubling as her twin yet showing the difference in the two . i could watch it over and over again , which i have done .i love bette davis she is one of the best! i can never get enough of her movies."
3,a stolen life,Bueno..realmente....cuando vi esta pelicula..me impresiono la versatilidad de bette davis..a quien considero la mejor actriz de todos los tiempos...si bien no es uno de sus mejores trabajos...es un deleite verla interpretar doble papel---- geln ford..esta a la altura del personaje.... buen melodrama..que sin duda .. les gustarasaludos
4,"28$ for ex rental ""good"" quality?","wow this mvie should be so much cheaperi want to see this becuase i wish to see more bette filmsi have seent he other picture she did as twins ""dead ringer"" and i loved iti guess i will just have to find this at a garage sale!!"
3,Bette is great---as always!,"Although there are better movies out there starring Bette Davis, this one was quite engrossing because of her excellent work and that of the special effects team make you forget she is playing both parts. The film itself is melodramatic and the ending expected, but still entertaining and fun."
5,I love this book,I love this book because it is so detailed. It really grab my atention. I recomen this book if you like readig about teasure and islands.
5,Great,"First movie I ever saw with my late father. Great movie, great cast and wonderful presentation (Blu-Ray). Recommend this movie for any serious western collector."
4,Essential John Wayne,"Perhaps the best John Wayne vehicle not directed by John Ford or Howard Hawks, ""Hondo"" (1953) gives the Duke one his most complex portrayals in this admirably low-key Western. Taut direction from John Farrow (the high-water mark of his career), with an auspicious screen debut for Oscar-nominated Geraldine Page. Veteran cinematographers Robert Burks and Archie Stout strikingly capture the Camargo, Mexico landscape. Originally shown in 3-D, ""Hondo"" deserves a theatrical reissue for a new generation of moviegoers."
4,Darn good for what it's supposed to be!!,"Customer reviews of Hondo seem to bounce from ""great"" to ""poor."" It appears that most of the criticism, other than some editing, is caused by the fact that this is an early 1950's western. Come on folks, of course the Duke is freshly shaven all the time, Page's cabin looks spotless, etc. It was made in the 1950's!!! This sort of ""lack of realism"" complaint could be directed at virtually every western made up to the time and of many others after. .... The action is excellent, even for a Wayne action movie, certainly better than some of his higher profile ""Indian"" westerns such as Ft. Apache and even Rio Grande and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. The tension and suspense waiting for the Apaches to come over the rise is palpable thoughout the movie. .... Acosta succeeds in this film as one of the most convincing of evil villains ever to appear in a western. .... If you don't have it, get it. You'll enjoy it a lot."
4,"""It's a good way.""","A great Duke classic. More action than most of his other movies. Im surprised I dont hear more about this one when people talk about their favortie Wayne movies. Indian attacks, knife fights, bar fights, and plenty of quotable Duke lines. I agree the editing was choppy but this is now one of my favorites. Highly recommended."
4,Worthwhile Wayne,"This odd, mid-period Western may not be at the top of everyone's John Wayne list, but it is worth seeking out for Wayne fans. Geraldine Page gives an Oscar-winning performance."
5,Hondo,This movie is excellent if you can skip the introduction. It implies that it was made in Mexico in 3D and that John Wayne picked the leading lady who was not well known at the time.
3,"Could Have Been Worse, Could Have Been Better","One of the best from early John Wayne, but it has the typical flaws of his earlier films: the supporting actress (Geraldine Page) is simply awful, and the scriptwriter kills off Wayne's dog for absolutely no reason. Other than that, it's better than average, considering how old the movie is. I liked a lot of the ideas behind the film (it actually wasn't ""just fluff""), and some of the scenes between Wayne and Page were very well-scripted; she just couldn't pull them off. Overall, die-hard fans of The Duke will love it, and Western lovers will enjoy it; but anyone else will wish to avoid this movie."
4,"""Comin' At Ya!!!""","No wonder 3-D never took off. ""Hondo"" has the makings of a really great film but the makers of the film are so concerned with projectile images emanating from the screen(""Watch the Duke shod a horse!"" ""Wonder at that Apache spear that whizzes at you!"") that they compromise a great story. John Wayne though does a terrific job as Hondo Lane, the half-breed with the ambiguous past. The film suggests a dark side to Hondo's character that is not fully exploited here but in a scant few years Wayne would tackle Ethan Edwards in ""The Searchers"" who was a fully developed morally complex individual. Geraldine Page, deserving of her Oscar nomination for her work here, assays a non-stereotypical account of the frontier woman. The film also offers an enlightened view of the Apaches. I give this film a pass but it's a shame that it compromised story for the sake of faddish technology."
3,Please release the 3D Blu-ray Version!,Originally shot in 3D! Why is there no 3D Blu-ray release? Certainly this film stands tall (like the star himself) when compared to many of the 3D Blu-ray releases available today. It is such a lost opportunity and a real shame that yet another new generation will be denied this 3D classic as it was meant to be seen.
4,It's A Shame...,"...that this movie, one of the best western the Duke ever made, is not planed as 3D-Blu-ray release although it was restored beautifully to 3D by the estate of John Wayneas shown on rare occasions.Hopefully Paramount and the estate of John Wayne will reconsider their decision. Then I will gladly add a fifth star to my rating."
5,One of John Wayne's best movies,"This is a great movie adaptation of a very good book by Louis L'Amour. If you like his books & you like John Wayne, how could it be wrong?"
1,Blu-Ray Incorrect Aspect Ratio and Cropped,"This is one of my most disappointing blu-ray purchases ever. As you can readily see from multiple sources, this film was shot 1.37:1, or ""full frame"" in 1953. It should NEVER be shown in 1.78:1 widescreen as it is on this blu-ray, because that requires cropping material from the top and/or bottom of the image (as you can readily see from the bonus materials, which were shot years ago and contain footage in the correct aspect ratio). It also means the image is magnified and exhibits huge amounts of film grain that result in a very soft image in many shots. Frankly, it's hard for a film instructor to believe a major studio would violate a film in this way. If you don't want to see the top of John Wayne's hat or people's legs everytime you're supposed to, go ahead and buy this blu-ray. Otherwise, seek out the excellent previous DVD release. The bonus features are the same and the image is all there."
2,The Picture Quality from this Blu Ray Version?,"Yes, The Movie itself is a great work but the picture quality from this Blu Ray Version shows almost no difference from that of DVD. Personally disappointed in this point very much. it doesn't seem to have the remastered process for this blu ray. SoPersonallyHondo [Blu-ray]I think it's not necessary to buy this blu ray version expecting better picture quality if you already have the dvd of this movie."
4,Good Movie; as always Indians are made to appear as a little stupid,"A good movie, till the moment whites left the ranch. I have a very high respect for Apaches. But in here they, as always in the movies, behave in a stupid way. Appart from Vittorio, a great chief, the rest looks like a bunch of ragged men that attack whites with little or no strategy. They normally don't charge in the open to some hostile force but choose their grounds in a clever way.The sad matter was, as John Wayne says in the movie, ""a whole way of life was erased from earth""It is not different from what is happening today in a lot of things."
4,"A Good Read, Though A Bit Whimsical and Fundamentalist","Meant to give it 3 stars, not 4.I first experienced Bob's material when I took the ""Perspectives on the World Christian Movement"" class at my church several years ago. Bob used this material to teach the second class.""Cat and Dog Theology"" parallels Bonhoeffer's ""Cheap Grace"" concept but is much more illustrative and easier to comprehend (and very entertaining). And it hits the nail on the head every bit as much as DieBon did. ""Cat and Dog"" asks us : Is God our cosmic servant (cat theology), or are we God's earthly servants(dog theology)? It also gives very clear examples so your can determine how much of a canine or feline you are (I still have to admit to a few ""meows"" myself).An important read for everyone, even us overly intellectual Presbyterians. (And certainly better than ""The Purpose Driven Life"", though just about anything is....)"
2,"John Piper, Jr?","Mr. Sjogren came to speak at my school two years in a row to do his powerpoint presentation, which is actually this book pressed into three 50 minute sessions. I immediately realized that what he was saying (and what he wrote in this book) is simply rehashing what Jonathan Edwards and John Piper (among others) have been saying. This book reads much like 'Desiring God' by Piper, only it lacks the theological depth and practical application that Dr. Piper presents in his book. Not only that, but Mr. Sjogren does not cite Dr. Piper or Jonathan Edwards in his presentation, when he uses some of the exact phrases and concepts that both have used before. Intellectual honesty = giving credit to whom credit is due.Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this book. Purchase 'Desiring God' by John Piper or 'Religious Affections' by Jonathan Edwards. They are both more original and VERY much more theologically minded."
5,Life changing book!,"When I was introduced to the concepts presented in this book I was dumbstruck with awe at how incomplete our understanding of who God is and His plan for mankind especially in America. Fellow Christians, this book will help remove the scales from your eyes and put a fire in your belly. If you truly love the Lord and want to know Him and make Him known read this book!"
5,excellent,"The book is in a great condition, the mailing was very fast. Thanks to them. Keep it going.The book itself is of course also excellent."
2,Good Idea sours,"Appreciate these guys for their intent however I was quite disappointed in the book. At first I thought it would be a great metaphoric reference and explore the curious dimensions of our ""aspects"" towards God but then it went into a straight-forward pietistic enjoining that left me feeling like I'd been suckered into it. I will hand to book to someone who doesn't mind that however--all in all an interesting pietistic read but it doesn't do much more than rehash old stuff. Not original as it portends to be."
3,Sunday School Stuff,"This is the basics folks. It's about serving God, not expecting God to serve you. I bought it as the authors were highly recommended to me by a friend, but I found it very ""pedestrian"".I'd think youth groups of Jr. High School or High School level might like it."
1,Horrible,"This book is exactly what is wrong with the church today. In this book, these two authors go way outside Scripture and introduce the reader to more psychobable and the devastating philosophy of man. There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end is death. The end of this book is death.We cannot alter Scripture to have it fit our values. We must be transformed by the renewing of our mind. (Rom 12) God is God and He alone deserves our praise. Read the Bible, not this book!"
4,Houstons very own sexy duo,"These two ladies did a fantastic job, Houston loves their Brother Serpent as well as Black Roses! I recommend these two songs as the first on your list of audio pleasure."
3,Did Not Enjoy Vocals in His Music,"Having own most of Yanni's previous albums, I purchased this album with great anticipation. Although I still enjoyed the simpler and quieter pieces in this album, I did not care for the heavy use of vocalizations on couple of tracks--it distracts the listener. All in all, this album is a lackluster departure from Yanni's best works, In My Time and Tribute. Buy it if you must complete your Yanni collection; but save your money if you are looking for a great album."
3,Disappointed,"My expectation was not met with this album. Nearly everyone of the songs were the same beat with very little variation. It was either flowing hauntingly or a very strong marimaba beat that would nearly drive you up the wall. Very disappointed, probably won't buy Yanni again unless he reaches out and includes a greater variety of rythm in his next album."
5,A wonderful CD!,"I love the change of this cd compared to other cds in the past. It doesn't have the glitz that the Live At the Acropolis and Tribute have. In some ways, Yanni is reaching out to his old style, and just being himself. And that's good too."
4,Loyalty won,"After sampling this latest Yanni CD I had to take it home, but it was moreso due to loyalty than anything else. Don't get me wrong, this is good listening, but I honestly expected more since he was gone so long. In my opinion Yanni's peer in the New Age category ""John Tesh"", has risen again as he always does with a new release ""Pure Orchestra"". whenever you want pure solace in an artistic, musical fashion, John Tesh's Pure Orchestra equals Pure Satisfaction!"
5,Meditative and Reflective,"Excellent for meditation or background music. This is a more reflective Yanni. Smoother, more consistent, softer. Melodically repetitious, with less orchestrated interludes and side trips. A positive and uplifting labor of love."
5,"Yanny, the Gift","this is the second time I buy this CD, the first one I damaged forexcess of play .I think Yanni is a GIFT of century 20th . Like other branches of ARTthe musician are in dangerous of extinction, I always ask myselfwhy the ART is leaving us and is so difficult to have artists likeSinatra,Anita B, Randy Crawford, Benson, Barbara, Sarah, so YANNIis one of these tiny group that make us live, dream, fly and keep theflame vivid in our hearts.thank you for letting me send the admiration for this great greatidol."
5,Beautiful Music Outstanding.,"Oh my I own this CD and is out of you Imagination so well done,I loved the song With an Orchid and November Sky well all is beautiful,I give this CD is a present and that Person didn`t know Yanni after She heard His music She is now a Yanny Fan,Thank you Yanni."
3,Lackluster,"This album is good. Although I really cannot understand the comments of people saying Yanni is the greatest of all time. I have to wonder about their musical diversity. He is a great musician...yes. But c'mon folks. This album truly sounds like a rehash of many of his other albums (which were all very good but getting worn), dontcha think? I am glad people like this material and that they see something different in it, but in many other genre's this would be considered a yawn and an abomination. Imagine the same lyrics and same melody lines in every song practically>That is what I hear of Yanni. Listening for more than a decade, I know everytime I pick up his albums I will hear the same ol, same ol. At the same time, maybe that's a good thing. People hate when bands change their style...But I guess I am not getting the diversity from this album I would like. Yanni is a talented guy...I just have more emotions in me than the ratio he depicts on this album and the last bunch."
5,Beautiful music can free the soul.,"I was introduced to Yanni by my father a few years ago and at first I couldn't get with it. My thinking was to constricted and I was stuck up about the music that I listened to, only rap and R&B. But the more I heard it and listened to it, the more I began to hear more than notes and ""weirdness."" I heard music. Real music for the first time. Music that means something and is something for EVERYBODY...if you are willing to open your mind. ""If I Could Tell You"" is just one in a long legacy of beautiful music created by Yanni. Not only does it sooth the soul, it takes you all over the world. I love it! It isn't the usual for an 18 year old but then again I'm a lot more open minded than other people my age. His music has made me more creative and stress-free. Whenever I want to be free, I put on Yanni...because beautiful music can free the soul."
5,Yanni that I like,"WOW! He is finally back, back with a bang. Great CD. I am long time Yanni fan and I have almost all of his albums. This one is among the best. I can't belive how can some people say 'compositions really were severely lacking in creativity' or 'nothing new' and such things. Why must Yanni change from CD to CD. Well, this is a change, especially after 'Tribute'. Some will say retro change but I salute it. All the tracks are great. Just listen to 'Midnight Rain', 'With an Orchid', 'Highland' and 'If I Could Tell You'. When I hear those tunes I feel like in heaven. I have this album for a few months now and it doesn't want to leave my CD player. Buy this album, you can't go wrong. Thanks Yanni!"
1,Well....,I guess I gave this the one star for disappointed expectations. I at least hoped he MIGHT try to actually play music. Oh well.
4,Good music - stop the singing,"Good Yanni music. Too much human voice, though. As artists grow, they seem to reach into areas that they aren't strong in. I think Yanni has reached that point. Several albums back, Aria was great and a lot of people (me included) liked it. Recently, he has been adding more and more female vocals, either exploring that area further or attempting to capture the magic of Aria again. His musical compositions are fantastic. I hope he returns to what he is good at."
3,Finally...SoothingMusic.com... Wow,"I have been searching for great instrumentals like Yanni's for some time now, but most new age albums are so cold and boring. That is until a friend Introduced me to a very talented new composer that I know you will love, especially if you like Yanni. Just go to SoothingMusic.com and listen to some truly inspirational samples. I have a feeling you'll be glad you did..."
2,Tapped Out ??,"I finally purchased this album after hesitating since it's release. And wish I hesitated somemore. Although Yanni still is better than most other musicians on his bad days, this is one of those bad day efforts.His new style seems to be emulating Arkenstone's(another great artist), witch is good, but he still needs more lessons from the master himself. And several times on the album you can tell he wants to revert to old successful themes, that have been used before,on other albums.Yanni has produced many brilliant pieces of work over the years. This album makes me wonder if his creative abilities are all taped out. I hope not for our sakes."
4,Synthesized Yanni,"Yanni and a Yamaha microchip. - that sums up this CD by Yanni, more creativity and musicians are needed here. Dissapointing after Tribute."
3,If you like Yanni check out BRADLEY JOSEPH!,I have been a fan of Yanni's for years until I ran across Bradley Joseph's music (Yanni's former keyboardist). If you like Yanni you will LOVE Bradley as he writes beautiful melodies and takes music were Yanni left off. Check him out at http;//www.bradleyjoseph.com
2,Back to basics?,"According to Yanni, this album was going to be a back to the bascis album for him. However, for those of us who followed Yanni long before the PBS special that made him a household name,this album is more of the uninspiring droll one hears on the smooth jazz stations. Yanni's early work was characterized by impressive high energy keyboard runs and upbeat tempos. This work gets lumped in with the other smooth jazz jibberish he put out in the late '90's."
2,The Excitement is Missing!,"Yanni has rested in his laurels in this long-awaited album. I didn't find any mystery in the music, just a lot of repitition. He is too laid back and didn't lead me into waiting for the next note-it was predictable. He doesn't bring the orchestra in rises and falling sweeps like in many of his other albums.. I thought ""The Flame"" was good, but the mystery he had in ""Until The Last Minute"" and the gentle touch he showed in ""One Man's Dream"" aren't evident here. It's 'okay music.' Yanni used to be spectacular."
1,yanni's new album - if i could tell you,"yanni's new album - if i could tell you (don't buy this cd!)yanni's new album is nowhere near acceptable. if you are expecting ""yanni"" music, you will be greatly disappointed. no soaring melodies here, no interesting rythms or unexpected twists in the music. just a lot of vocal ""ahhhs"", electronic drums and hokey sounding keyboards. after three years, he should have, and COULD have, done better."
1,I think it all sounds the same,I was looking forward to the Rhythms of this CD and sadly it all sounds the same. Maybe for intense Yanni Fans.
2,Linda Evans Breakup Music,"Very disappointed in the album, had to turn it off and play ""Tribute"" just to remember why I love Yanni."
2,"I loved Acropolis and Tribute, but not this one.","First of all, this is not a flame review from a Yanni hater, I loved, absolutely loved Acropolis and Tribute. The contributions of the live musicians Karen Briggs, Pedro, Armen Anassian, Ming, and all the other fabulous musicians really brought Yanni's compositions to life. On this CD you get the return to the ""old"" Yanni sound, although now he has some fancier drum machines and some fancier ""vocalizing"" computers. It is billed as a departure from his previous projects, and I would say if you enjoyed Tribute and Acropolis you may not like this one. However, if you liked Reflections of Passion, you may like it just fine. Anyone else hear ""repetitions"" of familar Yanni themes on this new CD? I did, and I thought that was a shame, too."
2,"If I could tell him I would say ""STOP!""",seems like Yanni has finally run out of gas. it was always out there and obvious that Yanni's compositions really were severely lacking in creativity. however many of us missed it because we got distracted by all the instruments and musicians in the band and the stage bravado of Yanni himself. well here stripped of all the theatrics we are treated to one dull and redundant track after another. better suited for elevators than true music fans.
5,In If I Could Tell You...,"Yanni shares with us from the depths of his heart and soul; his travels, his experiences and his thoughts. The spiritual and emotional impact of ""If I Could Tell You"" is unlike anything Yanni has done in the past. Without a doubt, this CD touches all of the five senses. Close your eyes and you are spirited away to the counties he has traveled. Through his music you will smell the sweetness of the orient, see the blue/green waters of the Mediterranean, hear the pounding of your heart to the native drums, and taste the bittersweetness of success. In its entirety, this CD will touch you.There aren't enough stars in the heavens to rate this CD."
4,Up To Our Hips- The Charlatans,Had this on tape and loved it. Wanted to replace it on CD because this is just timeless and a diamond in the rough. I def. recommend for you folk/rock lovers out there who tend to stray from the mainstream!
4,Buy This Record,"This is a stand out record by The Charlatans. When they released this, they were certainly out of favor as a band. Yet, they were bold enough to come out with a slower, bolder, and less poppy sound. They amazing thing is how well they did it. It led the way to the sound they have now, and in my opinion is the best record they have done since that time. ""I Never Want an Easy Life...."" is the second best song they have ever done after ""Sproston Green"". It alone is worth the purchase price."
4,Good but not great Kraan.,"I do like this cd,but they seemed a bit confused with this material.Maybe because of new member Joo Kraus,who replaced Ingo Bischof,had arrived.This is more rock,less quirky jazz.However Polarity is brilliant instrumental Kraan almost hypnotic.But hey,still good stuff,and Joo plays a mean trumpet along with the other guys usual high standard of musicianship."
4,In the depths of personality,"This is a watershed study that fostered the development of our contemporary understanding of motivation. Murray's eclectic use of interview, projective analysis and psychometric testing broke ground in 1930 that is still being tilled."
2,"""...a hurricane triggered by a butterfly's wings...""","I bought ""Concentration"" several years ago mainly for the song ""Butterfly Wings"" (#2); plus the clerk at the store where I bought it recommended the CD. Since then, I've learned not to listen to sales clerks. I'm not sure what I didn't like about it. I guess I had higher expectations after hearing ""Butterfly Wings"" and later ""Golgotha Tenement Blues"" off ""The Crow"" soundtrack. The rest of the songs on here just sounded weak in comparison. As one reviewer mentioned before me, this CD hasn't aged very well, and it's only been about 10 years since it came out. To be fair, I did like the guitar/drums/instrumentals on here, but the lyrics/vocals were kind of lost on me. So, in summary: if you're a MoLG fan, then you'll probably like this CD; but if not, then I'd recommend either borrowing this CD from a friend or downloading some samples first."
2,Doesn't age well,"Honestly, after hearing of this band from the Crow Soundtrack, I immediately snapped up their CD from the local independant record store. At first I was very impressed. But over the years, the music hasn't aged well, as compared to other bands in this vein such as Nine Inch Nails, or Front 242 (well they aren't exactly in the vein, but you get the idea). This album is very forgetable in that respect.Machines of Loving Grace are a Goth-Industrial album that has the edge taken off of it by using pop sensibilities and a Depeche Mode Synth feel. I simply feel this album is much weaker than their more polished work 'Gilt', which is a much more accessable and overall better album."
5,Bitchin',"I first listened to MOLG on the Crow soundtrack. I liked the song on there so much I took a chance and bought Concentration. What a great album! The songs are catchy; a great mix of industrial/techno... The lyrics make me think of the darker side of the big city, and of life. Great album.. makes me wonder why they don't get more recognition."
3,Short a Track,I give it 3 stars because it's incomplete!So - I bought this CD back in 93' when it came out ... still have it floating around - but ...um my MP3 rip from the CD has 12 tracks not 11.Track 12 (on the CD) is Titled: Trigger for Happiness ....so Amazon *and iTunes both only show 11 tracks.
5,A mix of smashing rock and solid industrial,"The first song I heard from MOLG was Golgotha Tenement Blues off the Crow soundtrack, and I picked up Concentration not soon after. AMAZING! The stuff I normally listen to is AIC, Soundgarden, STP, etc., but this album rocks! Butterfly Wings and Lilith/Eve are worth the whole album by themselves. In my opinion this album is FAR better than offerings by NIN, Gravity Kills, Stabbing Westward, and others. Seriously, a MUST own."
3,It's okay?,"Well, I'll try to elaborate.Simon Yam is a famous gigolo who attempts to help a new immigrant to succeed as a ""call girl"" (no fishnet stocking hookers here). This is a playful Hong Kong remake of ""Pretty Woman."" There's little art (or nudity) here, but it's entertaining fluff. Yam is charming (and cheesy) and Carina Lau is his fine counterpart in rentable love.Of course, there's a romance after the girl has been taught the ropes and some minor conflict. This film is a bit more realistic than ""Pretty Woman,"" though both are fairy tales and don't look at the gritty side of prostitution.In the end, it's okay."
5,A Beautiful Story!,This book was such a wonderful read. Such a beautiful relationship. My heart ached for these people. A great way to weave such important real life issues within a beautiful fictional world that we all yearn to be part of. I am such a fan of this book. If you are considering it... Go For It! It's worth it!
2,So So,This book was corny and not in a good way. There were some good parts but I found myself rolling my eyes through most of it.
2,Lacking Emotion,"This book reads like an instruction manual for straight women who want to pursue relationships with another woman. ""If you do this, this will happen. Here are the things society will think about you. Here is why."" It's a wordy, overly-explained story. If the author had let the characters share their experiences and emotions rather than simply listing them, it would read much less like an awkward textbook. And I agree with the other reviewer who said the hate crime was poorly written.There are much better books available in this genre."
3,enjoyable enough,"While i certainly enjoyed Love in the Balance, and would happily recommend it, I couldn't honestly give it a 4 or 5 star rating. It just wasn't in the same league as Parties in Congress, or Redback, or It Should be a Crime etc (all other novels I've devoured recently).The book was certainly well written, and the storyline was enjoyable enough, but I found the character of Connie to be a teensy bit annoying in the first half of the novel and her need for such an all-consuming friendship seemed to come out of nowhere. Perhaps I just struggled to connect with the characters??Either way, I don't regret buying and reading Love in the Balance but it didn't light me on fire either. I would happily read more from this author to see what else she has."
4,Highly Recommended!,"Connie Bradford and Kasey Hollander feel like real people with real issues and real lives. Both women are dealing with frustrating problems--Connie with a selfish pig of a boyfriend, and Kasey with the memory of love betrayed. Neither one of them has any idea how important the other will become as they begin to lean on one another to face difficult times.Marianne Martin has a wonderful way with characters, relationships, and with the smooth-moving plot. It's no wonder that she is one of the most popular lesbian romance novelists around. I highly recommend LOVE IN THE BALANCE as well as all of her other novels."
5,Handy tool kit,As a woman who is quite handy I think these tools are fabulous. Being in a bag as oppossed to a molded kit it gives the flexability to add more tools to personalize your own tool kit. I have already added some more tools. The tools themselves are good quality and the choice of tools to start the kit is great. Great for a woman as they fit nicely in your hands. I ordered one for a friend who recently got divorced.
4,Good Toolkit,"I really like this toolkit. The handles are very gripable and the tools seem to be good quality. I love the bag, it's very well made. Just what I needed for minor home repair projects."
4,Flavorful as expected,"This is my second order of the Coconut Bubble Tea Powder. I am constantly searching for new recipes to use it with. I tried Green tea base, white tea; rice milk. All tastes good. Since it is such a large quantity, I was not prepared on where or how to store it. Now, I store it in a large glass jar with a wide top glass canister with tight fitting lid available at Crate and Barrel or Walmart."
3,fun ride but she's done better,"Aggie starts off the story with a bang (a memorable, highly charged murder location) then sort of finishes it off with some rather silly, almost implausible resolutions to back it up. Only the very astute reader could possibley figure out ""who dun it"", but at least, you won't be bored. This reminded me of her later work The Clocks, which also had an effective beginning and got even more complicated than it needed to by the time it was over. To make up for its flaws, Christie does, however, put characters together you really wouldn't think would get together. She always was brilliant playing with audience expectations. PS: Even if you can't see the killer before Poirot does, you may pick up on a few clues in the same clever way, so the story isn't a total bust."
4,Satisfactory,"A good read, though I thought a bit too long with a lot of going back and forth across the Channel. The characters are well developed and the clues are offered (plus Christie's usual red herrings). The ending was drawn out and I think a bit obvious."
4,A Great Read,"This book was a great read and contained some very interesting characters. The book is quite complex. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down."
3,"Wonderful Premise, Odd Conclusion","Agatha Christie was perhaps a little too clever in creating the premise for Death in the Clouds. A woman is killed in a plane with eleven other passengers and stewards around her and let us just say that a wasp, a blowpipe, a dart, and snake venom are all involved. It is an impossible crime (I know this because one character or another says so, frequently) and quite an intriquing one. Sadly, the conclusion does not live up to the anticipation and Hastings abscence as narrator is sorely missed. It is always a joy, though, to read Poirot regardless and the book is crammed with many red herrings and a little more romance than usual. Not top drawer Christie but still a minor pleasure."
5,Another strong Poirot mystery,"Murder committed on board an airplane! Agatha Christie was certainly fond of unusual plot twists - murders committed on luxury trains, during card games, killers who killed in alphabetical order, but this one takes the cake! An old woman is mysteriously killed by a poisoned dart and suspicion naturally falls on her fellow passengers. Of course, Poirot who was on board, is called upon to find the guilty party. I found the way he meticulously traces the victim's life and tries to find linkages between her and the passengers interesting, it's much more realistic than detectives who are able to miraculously solve crimes seated in their armchairs! I also found the characters in the book very interesting, particularly that of Jane Grey. The twist at the end is fairly unexpected and the story is resolved in a satisfying way. A nice touch is the addition of a little romance that lightens up the proceedings. A very good read!"
5,Great story,I had read this book years ago and enjoyed rereading it agin. Agatha Christie is my favorite author and her books are timeless.
2,Doesn't do Aristotle Justice,"No doubt Aristotle was one of the great founding thinkers in the western tradition, but this edition of The Politics does not do him justice. The C.D.C Reeve translation published by Hackett is much better, complete with extensive notes, background, literary references, and a great bibliography."
1,This book deserves no stars.,Puleese! Even a novice dog owner can discern purely rediculous rot from reality. Tie a string around the bowl? Slosh the dog with ice water? Throw a heavy collar in it's face?The only thing positive or closely resembling any helpful information is the photos. At least now we know what a Rottweiler looks like!
1,Abuse... book of little use,I find this APPALLING and abusive. Whatever good is in the book is overshadowed by garbage like this:>>A check chain used in this manner gives the dog a shock and it should be accompanied by a tirade of abuse from you.

4,Xbox Live Rules.........But Version 3......,"Xbox live version 3 is an attempt by Microsoft to ""force"" you into purchasing a game you may not want. The other versions of live were only 49.99, which got you the headset and a 12 month subscription to live itself. Version 3 costs you an extra 20.00 for the included game, (Mech Assault), which if you were to buy it seperately would cost you 20.00 anyways. So if your not interested in getting the game look for the cheaper version's of live, provided they are still avaliable, and save the extra money to get a game you like better. Just make sure it's a live game because........ Xbox Live Rules.........Merry Christmas"
1,Halo is not an Xbox Live game,"Recently, I purchased Xbox Live for the biggest reason that I bought an Xbox: Halo. For some strange reason, I just assumed that the same corporation that owned the company that created Halo would automatically make their flagship game playable on Xbox Live. But, of course, I forgot that this same corporation was Microsoft, the corp. that brought us Windows. What was I thinking? Fortunately I have not activated my subscription, yet. This is just a warning to all those who might make the same mistake as me: don't get this if you want to play Halo online. Fortunately, the let down with this game should be remedied by its predecessor, Halo 2. Of course, the way Microsoft keeps delaying their release date for Halo 2 (it was originally slated to come out in February 2004, now they anticipate Fall of 2004) I probably won't be activating my subscription until about 2010. Thanks, Microsoft!!"
1,BOOOOOOO,"This is the worst product ever. It lags like hell. Also, my computer and xbox r in different rooms so i had to buy wireless equipment ($150) to play it."
5,Only a few titles???,"Not sure what the guy complaining about too few titles is talking about. There are somewhere around 70 XBL games right now. It is too bad that EA has hitched their wagon to Sony's online gaming plan and not XBL, though I think that's changing. One of the big benefits of XBL is that only those with broadband internet access can use it. What that means is that you don't get some guy with a dial in connection slowing down your game with an inferior connection and causing lag. This makes for one of the best, most consistent online gaming experiences you can get. If you have and XBox and don't have XBL, you're missing out."
4,No Mech Assault Included,"I just bought this from CompUSA and had the WORST service. Mech Assault was NOT included as stated on Amazon. Project Gotham Racing 2 is included and CompUSA claimed it was not their fault that the description was incorrect and they could send me a postage-paid return label and send me out another XBox Live but with Crimson Skies instead but they would not waive the shipping of $5 even though I already paid for shipping once when I rec'd the incorrect XBox Live. Amazon resolved the issue, but I will never buy from CompUSA again."
4,awesome!!,this item is pretty much the same as the rest with the communicater 12 free months of use but with this one you get the full version of mech assault thats pretty awesome but you dont get the case and booklet its pretty much the game in a plain case.
4,AMAZING!!!!!!!,"xbox is my favorite game system, period. with a hard drive, greatgraphics and sick games, it's a great system. Although, with xbox live, words can not describe how utterly incredible this console is. If xbox had only online play and no single player, i'd buy it. if it had no single player games and just splinter cell pandora tomorrow multiplayer, i'd buy it. my dad also plays these games online, and it got kind of boring watch eachother play, so we had to get another one. now i have two xboxes, two splinter cells and two headsets. i could not be a happier man. (unless i got another one) <tee heee>"
4,Fun but.......,"Xbox Live is very fun don't get me wrong, but more than often one of my younger brothers gets on and hears some stuff he shouldnt be hearing. also most FPS style games on it are rated M so this is not something that most little kids will be playing. But if your older this is a great item. I highly recomend it."
4,Read this.,Ok the dude down there was wrong. This wut u do to get xbox online for free. ITEMS:RouterComputerDSL/CABLE MODEMCAT-5 WIRENow go to www.xbconnect and download the new version. THADHA.See u online. My name is |-Scav3nger-| Send me a message.
4,Generation Gap,"An emotional movie, base on the relationship between the young generation and the old. In this movie, a grandson effort to capture his grandfather love. But because of the generation gap that exist between the two, misunderstanding arises. This movie is worth a look at, it focus mainly on the relationship within a family onces a death has occured. As the movie attempts to portrays this, there are sad and funny moments. I think, people can relate to this, even if don't understand the chinese language. A great movie to watch."
1,"Item not yet received, but this is South Africa.",Hope this item arrives as I am sure it will be great. Difficult to find so wishing it will find its way home.
5,"Sacrilege, but...","...I rate this as equal to anything in the GBs catalog. Grant was completely firing on all six when he wrote and recorded this down in Austin, TX, with a select cadre of hot sh-t alt-country musos...brilliant, toppermost of the poppermost songwriting, just impeccably played and sung...The showstopper here is the many versed, bordering on 10 minutes long epic, ""What Went Wrong"". McLennan really shows off his lyric writing ability on that one...Aside from that, the highlights are, typically, way too numerous to mention, though the title track and ""Open Invitation"" stand out.Get the import if you can find it - it's a double, instead of a single, and has 5 more tracks on it...."
5,A collection of Pop-Gems,"This a cd that you should, if you are a serious popmusic lover, at least check out. One gem after another comes along! This collection contains songs that could rang among the best songs of the '90 Pop (""Coming Up for Air"", ""All her Songs"" an ""Put you down"")It's a combination of clearry McCartney-ballads, melancholie Byrds-pop and Country-folk. Try it and you definitely won't regret it!"
3,"Endangered Species Zebra, Organic Dark (70%) Chocolate Tangerine Essence","Its now changed to orange essence and you can really taste the orange, it over powers the dark chocolate flavor making the combination not so great. One small bite is ok, but a whole bar just makes me sick, even just eating a little square is too stronge for me, but then again thats me. I love orange and chocolate, they go so great together but this one is just overpowering and doesnt work for me. My favorite by The endangered species bars is the dark chocolate deep forest mint, that is the best so I would go with that one but stay clear from this one unless you like a very strong orange flavor that overpowers the dark chocolate. I like just a little bit of essence of fruit or some other flavor in my chocolate but this one just doesnt please my taste buds."
2,Bitter Taste,First let me say I am a huge fan of endangered species chocolate. This is my first time however trying this particular mixture. I love orange and chocolate as a combination but this one definitely falls short. Unfortunately from what I can gather and the type of bitterness it is I am guessing they add too much of the pith while creating the orange oil. It has a smooth delightful start but the more you eat the more pronounced the bitter taste becomes. I am disappointed by the purchase and will not order this type again.
5,Fantastic Children's Book,"This book was written by my Grandmother. It takes you on a walking journey though S. Africa with my Mother (Phyllis) asking the questions ""Will it bite?"" or ""Can I eat it"" as many children do. My Grandmother paints a wonderful picture of the animals they see and native people living there. My Grandmother was a missionary nurse in the 30's and 40's in South Africa while my Grandfather built church's, library's, homes and schools. It is a sweet book, easy to read to a child, even in the United States. I know if your read this, you will enjoy it as much as I do.-Ansley Nosala - Yes, I'm named for my Grandmother."
5,Terrific song,"Had this been released in the US, this song would have gone straight to the top of the charts. Classic pop with a great world twist."
3,Difficult to assemble need lots of time and tools,"Comes completely dissasembled, need a lot of time and tools to build, This should have been indicated when ordering that you need 3-4 hours and tools to put this together"
4,Card Game,"Card and board games are hard to find these days, so was glad to find this game. It is an excellent game and the shipping/service was 5 star."
1,Not worth your time or money,"I was really disappointed by this card game. I am a long time fan of diverse solitaire versions and have several installed in my blackberry, so I thought a psp card game would only be better, given better graphics and screen size. Very wrong. The game is slow, cards are shown really small in size, and dealing and moves actions are bland. You would imagine that with a screen twice the size of a cellphone you could see a complete image of a basic spider solitaire game, but you actually have to togle back and forth to get the whole display. Definitively not worth the money."
2,Missing pages,"The seller misrepresented this workbook, and I was quite disappointed when I got it. It was advertised as being in excellent condition, and all of the flash cards were torn out of the back."
2,Spanish verbs error,"This book got the ""usted"" verbs wrong starting on page 42. For example, ""you speak"" is supposed to be ""usted hablas"", not ""usted habla"". ""el/ella habla"" means ""he/she speaks"". Otherwise, this book is OK for tourists who hadn't studied Spanish before. For the ""Spanish veteran"" who wants a review, you might want to try Ultimate Spanish by Living Language, Rosetta Stone, or better yet, take a college Spanish class."
4,"Easy, convenient, fast","and written clearly. Ten minutes every day is minimal investment, and should be supplemented by other means--help from Spanish-speaking friends, watching Spanish-language TV for even a few minutes. A good beginning for basic Spanish conversation. I highly recommend purchasing a language dictionary as well--most helpful."
3,Could have been good,This is a way for people to learn spanish fast but the book goes through things very quickly so you will find that you either don't understand or forget thing easily. I only suggest this book to someone how just wants to travel to a country that speaks spanish for a week but not for people who are truly interested in learning to speak spanish fleuntly at a good level.
4,Spanish in 10 Minutes a Day review,The book is very good in that it breaks down the subject into very easy to understand lessons. The lessons are interesting and will provide a stepping stone to learning more Spanish.
3,"Good for a traveler, Not for a class","I began using this as text for a class of mine, but quickly only used it as a supplement. You are to simply copy the words and say them in 10 minutes each day. It's a great theory, but very difficult to absorb any language through this method. The vocabulary is bent toward the traveler - what to pack, where's the restaurant, I'd like to order, that type of phrasing.The color pictures make it seem like it might be aimed at a younger crowd, but the exercises were a bit stale for anyone under high school age.Overall, this is a good crash course if you're about to leave for a week's vacation in a Spanish-speaking country. To learn how to truly communicate in Spanish, you need something more thorough on grammar points and practice. The fact that no CD comes with it also makes pronunciation a concern for the novice learner.Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
2,Useful for Some; But Not the Best,"I found this book to be useful at first, but I later changed to ""Spanish Made Simple"" (Jackson, Rubio revised by Nemethy; make sure you get the 2004 edition). The latter book is not nearly as ""simplified"" as ""Spanish in 10 Minutes"", but I found the more methodical approach, reviews, and review tests to be more conducive to study. Make sure you also get some means of audio instruction to get the pronouciation right. I used the Pimsleur CD's which are very expensive but easily the best. (Look for them in your library first.)"
3,"Song-stress, not album-stress.","I really hate to say this but I almost wish Juliana Hatfield would just make maxi-CDs instead of full lenth EPs. I totally dig her stuff, especially the juxtapositoning of her sweet voice (one that I could truly never get tired of) and often crunchy gitar. The only difficulty she seems to have is culling enough quality stuff for an album. When Juliana hits it with a really good song, she blows everyone away. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen that often, and not nearly as much as I'd like to hear."
3,"A few classic tracks, but plenty of filler","The truth is that this could have been a 5 star album, tracks like ""Spin The Bottle"", ""A Dame With A Rod"" and ""I Got No Idols"" certainly warrant full marks. However, the majority of the rest of the album is just filler - very bland."
2,Become What You Are? She Did,Hatfeild flared up seemingly from nowhere in the early nineties as an instant critical darling only to disappear with equal speed. Nothing here would indicate she deserved as much attention as she got.
3,Decent Early Entry,"This is an average version of Holmes. The story does not follow the original too closely and Owen does not have the appeal of Rathbone or Brett as Holmes. However, the atmospherics and acting are decent enough. Anna Mae Wong does a good turn as the suspect seductress."
1,Not the retro logo!,The picture shows the retro logo but it is the new logo. If I would have known it was the new logo I would not have ordered it!
1,Wake up Warner!!!,How come Warner can give us Looney Tunes uncensored with a warning / disclaimer on the box but can't do the same with Tom & Jerry?I still haven't bought Collection 1 and won't be buying this either. When you release these cartoons uncut I'll buy 'em.Simple as that!
1,Not buying it based on reviews.......,I'm not purchasing this DVD based on the reviews and also because the thought of Whoopi Goldberg giving an introduction based on HER opinion just makes me want to spew.
1,this set is garbage,the cartoons are EDITED folks..EDITED!!i'll continue spending my money on bootleg T&J; dvds from ebay since they are UNCUT & untampered with
1,It's Official,"Accoridng to a VERY reliable source, Three Tom and Jerry Cartoons have been edited (read: censored) on the DVD.3 of the Mammy Cartoons: Nit-witty Kitty, Saturday Evening Puss, and The Lonesome Mouse have Mammy's voice redubbed with a more ""political correct"" one.If you were ticked off by the censorship last year, Do not buy this set as you'll only get more of the same"
2,BEWARE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS,I purchased this for my 4 year old granddaughter because she loves Tom and Jerry cartoons - like I did at her age. There is something completely silly and wonderful about these cartoons - they are not political commentary. I find it revolting that we are subjected to a monologue by Whoopi Goldberg on political correctness before being able to watch this. The DVD also contains a warning that due to PC problem that the cartoons may not be suitable for children. Who are they for then? The cartoons get a 5 review - Whoopi and the warning reduce it TO A 2. The next time Whoopi is on TV I assume there will be a warning that she is expressing views that I don't agree with.
1,go chinese,"for all of you thats sick and tired of all of the editing just buy the chinese version off ebay,you get like 140 cartoons on dvd for only 10 bucks the shipping is 33 bucks for a total of one volume of the crappy american release.you chinese version can have the subtitles turned off and they are uncut and unedited"
3,"Why does everyone keep saying ""Warner Brothers""???","I have yet to purchase this, but I do have Volume One, which I'm enjoying. Apparently, I did not get through enough of Vol. 1 to notice the politically correct editing. The very concept of this type of censorship irks me, as well, but then again, I purchased the Special Edition versions of ""Star Wars,"" even though THEY were unnecessarily ""tweaked"" and toyed with. I just like having DVD versions of ANYthing I enjoy, I suppose.One particularly cringe-worthy pattern I noticed in all of these reviews was the mention of ""Warner Brothers"" as the culprit for releasing these cartoons in edited form. Tom & Jerry were NEVER Warner Brothers characters, people! They were Hanna-Barbera/MGM! Remember the roaring lion at the beginning of all the cartoons? Duh!!! :)"
1,More Whoopi Nonsense,"I cannot believe there is a ""Lecture on Racism"" by of all people Whoopi Goldberg on this DVD and plays before your kids even have a chance to watch the video, it is nonsense and not required. Tom & Jerry is an awesome cartoon but I would not buy this DVD if I had known what I know now about the intro."
5,My favorite espoide of Tom and Jerry spotlight collection,"Mouse in Manhattan from the spotlight collection of Tom and Jerry my favorite because of seeing old time NYC and music too ! all of Tom and Jerry are the best and greatest ! I reccomand this for every Tom and Jerryfan young and old , kids in heart also !"
5,Classic cartoons,"I got these for my grandkids. I think they should learn of the ""good old""stuff, not this Japanese stuff."
2,They Got It Half Right,"Didn't buy the first collection because of all of the negative reviews (and because I still have my Art of Tom and Jerry Laserdiscs that shows them in release order). After reading there would be a P.C. disclamer on the set I went out and bought it expecting unedited cartoons. Well, Mammy is back in place, but her voice in some of the episodes was re-dubbed to make her sound less stereotypical. And this after Whoopi G. spends 3 minutes telling us that the character is so important to the series that she just can't be left out. Poor Tom and Jerry. Will we ever see the original versions again? Either we see Mammy dropped and re-animated as a white woman, or we see Mammy and have her voice altered (in the 60s she even was redubbed with an Irish accent in some cartoons!). Or on TV she's just edited out sometimes. I give up."
1,Warner Bros..please fix the first collection.,I want re-mastered unedited Tom & Jerry. I will never buy these collections (first & second) until WB fix their mistakes.
5,life changing,"This book is truly life changing. M L J challenges you to realize that it isn't ""all about me!"" It is insightful, and the kind of book that makes you keep thinking about what you read, for a LONG time to come. JS"
5,The Sermon on the Mount,"I first read this book 2 months after becoming a Christian - 7 years later it is still one of the most influential books in my life. Simply brilliant, it will give you an in-depth understanding of the great teachings of Christ"
5,Excellent resource!,"If you're interested in learning what Jesus Christ taught in His Sermon on the Mount, this book will not disappoint. It is clear, concise and comprehensive. I know now why some in D. Martyn Lloyd Jones' church transcribed his sermon notes....they were listening to an exposition of the riches of the treasures of the Kingdom of God."
3,"Studies in the Sermon on the Mount, by D. Martin Lloyd Jones","A good book, but very verbose and repetitive. The book could have been written in half the space. It is good solid theology but is too long."
1,We wanted a stream NOT mood music.,The photography is great or at least the little bit that we could stand to watch. What is missing is the sound of the babbling brook. Instead what you get is the most horrible mood music.
3,Cute costume,Very cute...runs a little small in shirt and hat size. also more of a bugendy color and hunter green than red and green.
1,This should be FOUR stars for this product and supplier. Ignore the one star.,"I got this to make a pickguard for a guitar. There's actually enough material on each sheet to make two just in case you screw one up. It's a nice material to work with; it comes 3 ply (pearloid film, white plastic, black plastic base). I was able to work it very easily using a scroll saw, dremel tool attachments, sand paper, and drill. The piece I got was perfectly flat, also. This is something you don't always get with plastic blanks from other suppliers.Grizzly's shipping is a little steep ($9.75) for something that costs $25, but when you get the package you'll know why: it's extremely well packaged. The UPS guys could kick it around for weeks and not hurt the contents. Plus they shipped it out very, very quickly and I got it 2 days from being ordered (and that was via UPS ground!)I'm a happy customer, and saved at least $35-$100 by buying the blank and making it myself over buying a pre-made pickguard."
2,Not what I expected,I had my hopes set on a serial to The Gambler. Not up to the quality of the former but passable. Thanks. Gary Hill.
5,Superb,These were used books -- but were in exceptional shape just as described by the seller. Seller packaged them very carefully for shipment -- I cannot say enough good things about the seller.The content of the set -- the complete works of Abraham Lincoln -- is a must-have for any serious library.
2,Not as good as they could be.,We were very disappointed with these masks. They didn't last anywhere's near as long as the ones we've previously bought from this company. Quality control maybe?
3,the tape is 10 times better,"Back in the 90's, I bought Jerky Boys part 2 on a cassette tape, not a cd. After the crank-call concerning the scaffolding, you'd think that was the end of the tape, as it's the last title listed. Suddenly, you hear number-tones being dialed, and suddenly there's an answering-machine greeting say that you've reached 'Doggie do's and don'ts, a K-9 obediencetraining school, after the beep leave a message and 1 of their staff would call you back.' When you hear the beep, you hear a dog growling, and the guy who does the voice to Frank Rizzo starts screaming to death while the dog is attacking him and growling. It's HILARIOUS, and I can't understand why it's only on the old-fashioned cassette-tape and not on the cd?"
2,mixtapes are better,"ya 40 did his thing on the album... but really no energy was given off. (if you watch his Fight Klub battles you know what i'm talkin about) I was a little disappointed in the cd, there were a couple of songs that have a replay value. But i must recommend TRIGGER HAPPY and 40 TO LIFE mixtapes for any 40cal fans. Also i think this might have been a push back release. If you look in the booklet, you will see wrong release dates for hell rell and j.r. writer."
1,horrible 1/2 star at best,"I would just like to say that I was extremely let down...especially because until I heard this album I liked 40 cal the most out of the entire camp. This Lp has recycled lines from freestyles & battles. (all of which are terrible in comparison to its original context) If you're a 40 cal or dipset fan just stick to the mixtapes 40 to life & trigger happy. Oh yeah, that was a wack diss track. Sam Scarfo killed him in the battles. What happened 40?"
4,Versatile Design,"The most significant aspect of these couplers is that they allow for use with pedals of differing brands (input/output heights). As such, they have found their way onto my pedal board where I have 6 different brands of pedals. Couplers can reduce the length of the chain and make the board less cluttered. These couplers seem to be sturdy and quality built. Again, the ""angled"" aspect of their design is the key for choosing these over other couplers."
4,Good stuff,"Another excellent wrestling book (along with Ric Flair's, The Death of WCW and the Tag-Teams). It's always interesting to find out about a promotion I knew little about, since I was a NY east coast fan with basically the WWWF as my wrestling promotion of choice. Great backstage stories as well as great stories about booking and match philosophies. My one peeve would be Matysik's need to skewer Vince McMahon and the present day wrestling product. Sure, about 90% of what he says is true and accurate, but taking shots at WWE is both easy and common now and comes off as unoriginal and tiring. Suggested reading for any wrestling fan."
5,Wrestling at the Chase,This was given to my brother as a gift and he really enjoyed it as I'm sure it brought back memories of watching it on TV.
5,Excellent Moving Aid... very helpful,"There are very few books about moving out there... trust me, I've looked. This book helped me figure out what to do. It's so comforting to have some sort of a guide while going through a move. If you're relocating, I strongly recommend hearing from the experts."
3,not 1000 per pill,"Life Extension is a good brand, in my opinion, but the serving size for the bottle I received was 3 pills for 1000mg, not per pill as said on this page. I'll be going back to a single 1000 pill."
5,A GREAT Book!,"I loved this book. Nothing heavy - just a nice, light, funny story about an average guy trying to fit into the U.S. Army. I agree with the other reviewer - it really takes you back to a better time."
4,"Informative, very frightening","if the content was not so disturbing, i would have enjoyed the presentation"
5,painful but true,"A meticulously researched, documented and shcolarly work by one of Malta's best journalists. This book is painful but necessary to read for anyone who, like me, is Maltese, but I have to admit this is all true. There is a section of our fellow country-men who like killing birds and this book examines the phenomeon which shames out country to this day. It attempts to understand why people do it and the facts horrify the reader without the author having to embellish anything. It is a much needed work which Maltese will benefit from reading and discussing. Years from now no one will be able to say ""we didn't know"" !"
1,"It's a good song, but this is a crappy CD.","I like Robot Rock, but when you get the subpar Soulwax remix (which does eventually become tolerable after a minute and thirty seconds or so), and the bizarre Maximum Overdrive track, it sort of kills the glory that is Robot Rock. Why buy this when for two dollars more you can get their whole fabulous new album?"
1,Talent All Gone,"I couldn't find anything to like about this album. By the time of this (or the equally-execrable ""Flying The Flag"") the CBB was a hollow, wasted shell of themselves.Best avoided at any risk to life & limb."
2,Warning!! No maps included in this edition,"Warning!!! Don't buy the edition of 'The River War' published by Wildside Press (ISBN 1592246109). It has NO MAPS OF ANY KIND. NONE. This book is primarily a description of a military campaigns, and large parts of the text, including almost all of the discussion of strategy and tactics, are almost incomprehensible without a map. Unless you already know where Korti and Metemma are, not to mention Suakin, Korosko, and Abu Hamed, get another edition."
2,No maps!,Churchill's wonderful writing of these complex campaigns becomes an exercise in futility if one can't follow along on a map. I'm going to return this edition.
4,British history...well done,"Curchill's literary style makes the opening chapters a challenge. A prior interest, and some knowledge of this era in history is a great help to the reader, while the author developes his material.A cohesive, well-written, story of the time is the result. Make your way through the early pages of the book, it's worth it!"
4,Frightening wake-up call,"I confess that this book sent me into a state of depression. This is because Margaret Atwood has successfully extrapolated several existing global scenarios to their inevitable conclusions. The turning point for me was when I read about the spider-goats and realized that this part wasn't fiction. The future is here. Genetic manipulation of animals is occurring, and we all know what's happening with the corporate-controlled genetic engineering of our food supply (or at least we ought to). To my mind, Snowman ends up questioning how it all came to pass, finally realizing that, on all the occasions when (despite de-sensitizing and conditioning by the corporations in control and by the Internet/media) he questioned the morality of proceedings, he could have done something to prevent their outcome. My fear is that many of us will one day find ourselves in the same position."
2,depressing and left wanting an actual story,"Like others have said, this is mostly back story. AT the end, where there was about to be a confrontation, the book simply ended. I checked this out at the library and am glad I didn't buy it."
2,Bought for class,"I had to have the book for a class. It wasn't really my taste. I like happy things, not depressing things."
4,Better than most,"On the paperback version of this book someone mistakenly says that Mrs. Atwood's vision of the future surpasses George Orwell's 1984. Her version of the future is bleak, dark, and depressing. There is not many uplifting moments and, at times, it seemed to drag.However, dispite it's ugly themes, this book is very rewarding. Atwood is not messing around and wants to convey her feelings about our world and where it is heading; most likely, she feels, into the future of Oryx and Crake.She spends too much time talking about what the future is like opposed to giving us the goods on Snowmans past, which is much more interesting.If you want a intelligent book with food for thought, this book will satisfy. This is not pop fiction, yet not overwelmingly intellectual. The themes are important yet simple, the drama of Snowman's past, very engaging. 5 stars for the ideas, 3 stars for entertainment value. I feel that if you read this you will not regret it."
3,Interesting but convaluted,Atwood's world is bleak and doomed. Not an uplifting story - but the writing is supurb and the story definitely keeps you interested. I did find that it was somewhat convulted and had trouble understanding how and why the virus was spread - as it appeared to be spread on purpose by Crake. Other elements were somewhat convulted as well. Also - no end to story.
2,This book feels empty. The supporting characters are more interesting,"Old lady Atwood, I am very disappointed in you for publishing this crap that you call literature. Seriously? What was the point of writing Oryx and Crake? I had to stop after page 72. 72 pages of absolutely nothing. I expected more after reading such an excellent and inspiring book like 'The Handmaid's Tale'.Off to read Kawabata to cleanse my brain."
3,well written but strange,"The book is well written, but the storyline is very strange at first. Glad i read it but don't think I'll get the sequel."
3,A speculative fiction with big ideas and a tiny cast,"Not fully realized, but a fairly entertaining post-apocalyptic story from a strong writer and a fast read. Part of the problem is that I prefer big books with big casts, and this book has, in effect, only three characters. And those three characters are each just annoying enough to make the book feel really claustrophobic. Probably not a deal-breaker for everyone, but it was for me."
4,Strange! Loved It!,"What a strange book! I enjoyed it and I love the Crakers. If I was Snowman I think I would have been a little more creative with the customs and beliefs that I instilled in them. He thought he was the last human left, why not have a little fun? lol. How about before every meal everyone must high five, on birthdays everyone will do a birthday dance instead of a birthday song... He could have taught them to rap haha (not that I like rap, but it would have been funny.) I had to keep thinking things like this as I read to keep up my morale. What a very scary, lonely and depressing world Snowman had to face. The ending was no ending at all, more like a cliff hanger, but with no second part to follow, but I still really loved this book. :)"
3,Oryx and Crake,"The speculative elements in this novel were excellent, frighteningly realistic: genetic manipulation, reality TV, websites of all (generally nasty) description. As an extrapolation, an ""idea story"", this worked well.However, despite smooth sentence-level writing, I found the characters somewhat limited and, especially, found the plot a bit weak. Not a lot happens here, and the crisis, told in flashback, seems underwritten. The ambiguous end works well, but overall the plot structure didn't draw me in."
2,Cliched and unimaginative,"As a long term fan of both sci-fi and Attwood, O&C should have been my ideal holiday reading. Instead, it's a real disappointment. The sci-fi elements are predictable and cliched, and the rest shallow and unbelieveable. None of the characters have any depth and their motivations are hazy. We never really learn why Crake destroys the world, nor why Oryx is involved with Jimmy or Crake's project. The minor characters are simply cardboard cutouts. On top of all that, the heavy-handed anti-corporate and global warming messages are simplistic and naive. Why two stars then? Two reasons: the writing is elegant and effortless, and the last page provides a moment of genuine interest."
1,Staring at the stainless steel abyss,"A struggle, and a waste of time. I felt as if i were locked inside an airless bubble of poorly-digested secondhand ""scientific"" press clippings - the sort of regurgitated drivel you might find in the washbasin on a 'plane. I've read everyone of her books since ""Surfacing"" but no more Margaret Atwood for me. If the author were unknown surely this book would never have been published. Don't buy it. You can rescue my copy from the dumpster, if you must."
2,Disturbing.................................,"For once, a Margaret Atwood book where we do not get treated to the main characters menarche! However, like Robber Bride and Blind Assasin we do have some very disturbing descriptions of child abuse, particualarly as in this case it is presented in language which is much closer to standard erotic literature. The children are beautiful, nothing is painful. Even the adult victim refuses to admit the horror. This aspect makes me very ambivilant about this book, and about an author who has always been one of my favourites. If you too are likely to feel nauseated by child abuse, don't read."
3,I didn't like it,"I have read all of Atwood's novels. I loved The Handmaid's Tale but did not like this book. It just didn't work in the end. Yes, there are some clever ideas, but the plot and characters did not pull together for me."
2,Don't Bother,"This book was a serious waste of time. Like most commercial fiction, the prose was common and uninspired, the plot was a heavy-handed attempt at sensationalism, and the characters were metaphoric inflations of mankind without any depth. Add that to the fact that the plot is crippled by more than a few abusrdities and holes and that Atwood isn't a skilled enough writer to make her tale of an apocolypse resonate in any meaningful way, and what you're left with is airplane reading - although I really wouldn't even recommend this book for that."
2,"Nasty, Brutish, and Short","I'd heard about this book here and there, and decided finally to read it.As soon as I started, I started wondering why.Not why are the events in the book happening, or why does the point-of-view character do thus and such, why did the big pre-book badthingthatchangedtheworld happen.No, none of those.Why am I continuing to read.Why am I continuing to read as the book sinks deeper and deeper into minutiae.Why am I continuing to read as the vagueness flows out over me like fog.Why am I continuing to read detailed and horrifying descriptions of kiddie porn.I couldn't tell you.Other than that, with very rare exceptions, I finish what I start reading.I have finished what I started.And I shall not start it again.Throughout I had a sense that this novel is about childhood and adolescence. Immature motives, immature feelings, immature actions.And at it's end, emptiness."
1,What the...?,I agree with Io's review - this book is a waste of time. It is just too out-there. There are so many other worthwhile books to NOT torture yourself on this one. Ugh...
1,One of the worst books i've ever read,This book was terrible how can somone actually write such filth? I've read many s-f books in my life and this was at the bottom of the list i wanted to throw it in the garbage as soon as i finished it. The ending was horrible! This book wasted my time. As i began to read this i thought to myself get to the point! Why linger on such stupidities? Why end the way it did? After reading this book i don't think im going to buy another Margaret Atwood novel.
1,Atwood's worst,"(...)""Orynx and Crake"" is mostly backstory, and we never really get a good sense of how Snowman develops, after the backstory, because there really isn't much actual story. The lovely prose is subverted by a much too unsubtle 'warning' about genetic technology that feels overly pedantic.And then there's that warning itself, and all the ideas she uses to demonstrate it. If she'd accepted her scifi roots, and done some homework, she'd know that Heinlein and Dick (and others) did them all decades ago, and she could have revisited them with something new to say. She clearly did not."
1,Don't Bother....,"Had this novel been written by anyone other than Margaret Atwood, it would be sitting ignored in a bargain bin. Greater than my dismay at forcing my through this trite,tedious exercise in self-indulgence is the fact that I wasted money buying it in hardcover. I am parting ways with Ms Atwood and the publishers and editors who live in fear of her reputation."
5,great!,was required to read this book for my college english class and it is so good. it is one of thosebooks that when you start reading it you cant put it down. it definately has some language amd risque scenes but it is overall really well done.
2,Far From Atwood's Best,"A boring, depressing, and condescending piece of work. If Atwood's name wasn't on it it would be lost in the shuffle. The saddest thing is the lack of originality. At least The Handmaid's Tale had that."
