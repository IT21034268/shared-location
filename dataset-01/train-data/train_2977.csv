3,Not the author's best -- start somewhere else,"I really enjoyed Emma Holly's Blace Lace novels and have been less happy with her forays into historical fiction. She does write great sex scenes ... too bad there aren't more of them in these recent works. I don't find bloodsucking heroes particularly thrilling so Catching Midnight and its successor, Hunting Midnight, did little for me (though I wasn't turned off by the vampire theme, as I fully expected to be). I think this author does much better with modern settings and hope she returns to them soon."
2,Kinda slow but will pull you in towards the end...maybe,"I read Beyond Seduction and while I wasn't overly impressed with that book, it did make me curious enough to give Catching Midnight a try. I'm not exactly into vampire/shape-shifting novels, and this was both. The book was a very slow read - the kind that you push through because you want to finish it, not because it's a good read.I will say that towards the end, I was really rooting for Gillian and Aimery - I wanted them to find a way to stay together. For me, that is a great sign that while I wouldn't necessarily recommend the book to someone, I wouldn't discourage them from buying it either, hence the two stars.Make no mistake about it; Emma Holly is an excellent writer. I just don't get into the vampire/shape-shifting thing. The other book I read by her was very good and I recommend her as an author. This book should perhaps be bought from the half-price bookstore or something."
3,Expecting Much More Spice,"Considering Emma Holly's talent for erotic romances, I thought this tale of shapeshifters and mortals to be on par with her other novels. In fact, having rediscovered my taste for paranormal romances, this one had a rather interesting premise.If anything, the sexual scenes lacked the emotional intensity I have come to expect from someone whom my favourite writer, Robin Schone considers one of the best in the genre. Not to mention they were rather vanilla in scope.While I enjoyed Aimery Fitz Clare as a beta male hero, it seemed as if Ms. Holly was trying to make him both a beta and an alpha male. Gillian was probably one of the most boring immortals I've ever read about. I couldn't empathize with her. Nim Wei would have made a better lead heroine, because there seemed to be more depth to her.While I was disappointed in this book, I am looking forward to reading Ms. Holly's Victorian-themed romances."
2,Couldn't finish,"I love Emma Holly usually and wait for every book she writes. This book was so boring, I couldn't even finish it."
2,blah ......... there are too many good books out there to bother finishing this one,"Well, it's been said by other reviewers but I'll say it again. This book is not worth wasting time with. Unlike many of the other reviewers to give this book a less than stellar review, I AM a paranormal fan but the book just doesn't deliver on any level.I didn't feel much for the characters, and didn't feel any sensuality/eroticism at all. It's rare for me not to finish a book but there are just too many good books in this genre to waste my time with this one, so 3/4 of the way through, I'm putting it down and picking up something more promising."
1,Why Bother?,"This was the third Emma Holly book that I read and I was extremely disappointed. This book is preditable and completely tame. Some things are left unexplained and the reader can predict the sequence of events. If you haven't read it, don't buy it."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"---ONE STAR FOR THE STORY LINE.The story line is catching, but the writing itself is abominable. I was recommended this book by a friend, and I will NEVER listen to her again.The heroine is at best an ""amateur"" although she is very old in ""human"" years. She's lost and looking for someone to love her as she is. Now, the hero, is scarred and disfigured--yet his brother's wife is obsessed with him for some otherworldly reason.The villains are by no means ""evil"". In fact, Nim Wei(the villain) seems to fall in love with the hero's brother, without even putting up a fight, of sorts.IT DRAGGED! I WAS THINKING OF GOING BACK TO B&N; FOR A REFUND! HORRENDOUS BOOK! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,What Happened?,"I am a huge, I mean HUGE Emma Holly fan. I love her erotica and I love her first two books in the Romance genre. So... you can imagine how disappointed I am that after 4 weeks I still have not finished reading this book. It took me about 5 days to read every other book of hers but I became so uninterested in the characters that I had to force myself to even get three fourths of the way through. What happened to the passion and sexual tension between her characters that is usually so beautifuly writen. I didn't find the story erotic in the least bit. Of course I will buy and read her next book because everything else that she has written has been amazing but I can't recommend this one.If you want to read a truly wonderful story of Ms. Holly's try Beyond Seduction ... but be careful...it could burn a hole in your sheets."
2,What Happen?!?!?!?,"I really love Emma Holly and as other reviewers have already stated found this book tedious at best. I was first surprised by the shift in genre but felt that the premise was interesting and I was willing to give it a shot. I was very sad to realize that I had to force myself to pick the book up in order to read it after the first few chapters. Yes, I know books can at times have a slow start, but this one NEVER picked up. I kept looking back on the cover to make sure that it said Emma Holly instead of perhaps another name. Alas Ms. Holly's name did grace the cover. I kept reading for two reasons. I spent money on the book, and I WANTED the story to get better only I couldn't change what was already printed.If this is a first time read for you by this author pick up one of her older books in order to see what this author truly capable of. Do yourself a favor and borrow the book from a friend."
2,Shape-shifters are a dog of a disappointment.,"Should have been called ""Dark Menagerie."" I loved Holly's ""Beyond Seduction"" and ""Beyond Innocence,"" so why did I find this eagerly anticipated book so...boring? Simply, it's missing the humanity that made the previous novels both plausible and sexy. If you can't get enough of shape-shifting, blood-drinking, angst-filled immortals in search of life mates to convert, this is for you. Personally, I hope Holly just dipped into the fantasy genre for a lark, and will give us a few more of the sizzling erotic historical romances that I enjoyed so much before."
5,Everything is better with chili,"This is a really fun book. I like how the various chilis are identified by the region that enjoys them. One of my favorites is the Cincinnati chili, which has chocolate in it. Hey, anything with chocolate has to be a good thing, right?I found another book like this for hot dogs, which also have a lot of interesting regional differences.Great American Hot Dog Book"
4,good food and usually easy to prepare,"I was given this book as a gift and I must say, I was pleasently surprised. At first, I looked up the state where I live (Washington) and it was coffee chili and I thought that was pretty generic. But as I tried recipe after recipe, I found some really good ones. I just made Wyoming tonight, it was fabulous (and hot!). Not only do you get chili receipes, but you get good side dishes, resources for buying some of the harder to find products, and most helpful, a guide to the various techniques such as cooking dried chili peppers. And don't worry that it's all going to taste the same, the recipes vary greatly, both beans and non-beans, some even without meat."
3,A mixed bag.,"I love Puccini's music in this opera--what he writes for the voices and for the orchestra. I'm also a big fan of the Met's video productions of their many operas; not just the ones done recently in high definition, but those done on video tape since the 1980s at least. They are well-directed; thank you, Brian Large, director of this one.Overall, I enjoyed Karita Mattila in this production; I thought her acting was absolutely right for what is, after all, a stage production (not a film). Her voice isn't perfect at every moment, but she won me over.I find tenor Marcello Giordani uneven, based on a couple of performances I've attended and when I've heard him on the radio, and in this video; I mean this re: his voice and his acting. I find it a bit painful to watch and listen to him. I agree with another reviewer, though, that he is better in the final acts than in the first two."
3,PINK??,"Product worked fine, but it came in PINK! I have a boy and had to use a girly light PINK headrest. Was very dissapointed"
3,"Nice sequel, too abrupt ending","I'm a huge fan of Chris Van Allsburg's stories, and illustrations. As a child, my mother would read me Jumanji fairly often, so I bought it after watching the movie with my kids. When purchasing Jumanji, I saw that Van Allsburg had written this sequel - Zathura, and had to buy it too, although I was unsure how he could make another unique story from the same idea. I shouldn't have doubted.Finding an alternate game inside the Jumanji box, Danny and Walter Budwing are sucked into a space adventure and have to work together, which is against their nature at the beginning of the book, to get back home. While the story is nice, it ends too abruptly, and could have easily been written into a better, longer, story, which I'm sure my kids would still sit through with rapt attention.If you like Jumanji, and always wondered what happened to Danny and Walter, then I would recommend this book, even though it's not Van Allsburg's best work."
2,Not up to snuff,"Introduced to van Allsburg's work while in design school, I immediately fell in love with his drawing style and unique perspective. I often buy his books as much for the drawings as for the story. Unfortunately, this book falls WAYshort. The drawings are painfully out of perspective - lines don't go to a common horizon line, the younger brother's head is grossly distorted, sometimes hands just don't make sense.As for the story, this book lacks the real adventure, wonder and excitement of Jumanji. The couple of space creatures are bumbling and not a real threat. There are no great scenes like monkeys in the kitchen or rhinos charging through. My advice is to save your money. If this wasn't a gift, I would return it."
5,Zathura,I read Zathura by Chris Van Allsburg. I liked and would recommend this book because I thought it was very cool. In the book I read about the alien rbot coming off the spaceship and into the house. This helped convince me that it was a good book.
5,NOT HIS BEST BUT GOOD SOLID WORK,"I am a big fan of Allsburg's art work. His capturing of shades is almost magical. This work is no exception. I was not as thrilled with the narrative of this one as I was with much of his other work though. This author obviously has a great imagination and great story telling abilities...he probably could have put them to better use here and been a bit more original. That being said, this is still a very good book and certainly worth owning. Recommend it highly."
3,"Not as great, but not terrible","The concept and the incredible resolution are still interesting. However, I feel it lacked the exciting and dangerous quality of the first. The space theme seems more difficult for students to identify with. The wonderful development of the sibling relationship is still there and the illustrations are still incredible, although they have a more rough and textured quality. Children will still enjoy it, just not as breathtaking as Jumanji."
4,Funny and biting.,"This bile-filled indictment of the art world deserves praise for its honesty and its humor. If you know about art, but don't feel like you're part of the world, buy this book."
4,Great for the Allergy-Prone Dog,"This product was recommended for our highly allergic dog. What a great product! His post-bath itching is reduced by 95%, and his skin is nicely conditioned. Additionally, we have no issues with red skin after his baths anymore, which is wonderful! Can't recommend this enough to anyone with an allergenic pet!"
5,Great Product!!,"This product is wonderful!! I use it on my teacup poodle in conjunction with the Hylyt cream rinse. Now she doesn't have dry skin so she scratch anymore. The other thing that I really love about this shampoo is that since there are fatty acids in it (as opposed to harsh lathering agents), her long coat is not a wet tangled mess after I rinse out the shampoo. I can easily comb it out from there if I want, which is no small matter as it is typically 2 - 2.5 inches long. I highly recommend this product to everyone who is a dog owner."
3,"Good read,but incomplete","This was a good history of the C-5 Corvette, of which I knew little. The only flaw is the book covers engineering and body extensively and practically skips over the interior. The only real interior photographs are of non-stock customs in the back of the book. A complete book on a car should cover the COMPLETE car."
4,Good for the C5 enthusiast,"I have a 2000 C5 that I've modded fairly extensivley with the mindset of developing a competitive road course car. As such, I'm a fan of the C5 (and any quick car) and enjoyed this book."
5,Majestic Fingerstyle Guitar Recording in the Takoma/Fahey Tradtion,"Sean Smith is a contemporary fingerstyle guitarist from California...firmly rooted in the 'Takoma School' Guitar Tradition pioneered by John Fahey and Robbie Basho. Sean's greatest strength is his ability to create beautifully emotive and unique story like compositions that sets him apart. With Sacred Crag Dancer Corpse Whisperer Sean creates music with an intense exploratory feeling, and Most of the pieces on this record were created through improvisation and in some cases, with strings not set to proper pitch. As with his Self-Titled debut his playing is sinewy, vital, and Beautiful. Recommended tracks 'Extrance' and the title track!"
3,thin fabric. useless strap,"the cotton on this laundry bag is very thin. and may not stand up to being stuffed with clothes and dragged around. the strap is pretty much useless even with it full it can not be used to carry the bag over your shoulder. and seriously. would you really want to injure your back carrying home clothes from the laundromat. three stars because its my favorite color black. we shall see if it stands up, and when it has to be washed with the clothes"
1,sucks,"i like several songs from this cd but since i can't listen to them and i can,t remember the title i'm not going to be able to buy it. thanks for nothing"
2,"""Sir, your are tedious.""","Tedious focus on exercise, with no examples from classic songs. ""Boring"".Mr. Brozeman has no charisma, his analytical perspective of the Blues is alien to the classic performers of the Blues. I can't imagine a young Robert Johnson sitting down with this tome in hand and emerging as the creative innovator he did, NO WAY!Not for the creative musician."
5,Very good place to start,I'm an intermediate player who bought 3 books to learn slide from.This is the best of the bunch. The book covers a lot of ground butthe basics are here as well. Well spaced info and a good CD tolearn from. Other good books on blues (but not slide per se) are the Kenny Sultan series - they are not as hard as the Grossman and Mann books
5,Acoustic Masters Series: Bob Brozman's Bottleneck Blues Guitar,"I have been playing for over 30 years, this is the best book on Bottleneck blues guitar. It is also alot of fun to play."
4,Great Intro to Slide,"Great intro to slide guitar. I am an advanced player but have never played slide. I was able to pick up the picking styles and rhythm quickly. The control of the slide and smoothness is the hard part, but fun to learn. Interesting music information and examples that get you going on the right foot. The music audio examples on the CD are very helpful."
4,Good lessons,Good book. Easy to follow tabs and cd. It's a good start for learning slide. Blah blah blah blah blah...
5,Highly recommended book!,This is a highly recommended book. Vehlow has very good writing and I would love to read another book of hers if she had one. I would highly recommend this book to anyone! Gwenith is a great writer!
3,Read with an open mind,"I think you would really have to be a passionate fan of POTO to truly enjoy this book. While I do consider myself a fan of both the musical and the original story, I found this book to be tedious to get through and was thankful that it's very short.The storyline in and of itself is not bad - I think it's what most POTO fans (mainly women I would wager) want to see happen with Erik and Christine, to a certain extent. However I think the age of the author compromises the story in her writing style - it seems very repetitive and very...'fairy-talish' to me. I would have much preferred there to be more action in the story and much less reviewing the feelings and emotions (over and over and over again) of the main characters.Keeping in mind that the author was only 17 when she wrote this, it was a very noble effort and impressive for a first publication at that age, but for somebody looking for a good story I would look elsewhere."
2,Phantom of Paris disapoints,"I just got and read the book ""Phantom of Paris"" by Gwenith M. Vehlow. While Miss Vehlow has some obvious potential as a writer, and I fully support young writers (she is 17), but I was sorely disapointed in the quality of her work, and found it to be little more than semi-glorified phan phiction in a printed form, full of predicable phan phiction cliches (i.e. Raoul is suddenly a terrible, terrible monster, and Erik makes a miraculous change of heart, etc, etc).Important characters were mentioned fleetingly or left out, while other smaller characters who did little to further the plot were focused on. All in all, a real disapointment for this Phantom Phan."
2,Pass this one up!,"The only thing worth mentioning about this book was that it was written by a teenager. I must commend the author's passion for the story, which is quite evident throughout the book. However, with all the grammatical errors, redundant terms, and repetitive motions of the characters, I simply could not embrace it as I did some of the other Phan Fictions. She portrayed Raoul in a horrible, unlikely manner. Erik became rather pathetic, and Christine was just plain annoying.If you want a good find, go for Progeny (by Becky Meadows) instead! 2 stars for effort~"
2,E.A.'s Review,"It has been a few months since I read this book, but the thing that stuck the most was how sugar sweet it was. An easy to digest tale, that I would suggest for those under the age of thirteen. This perhaps stems from a reflection of the author's own young age. Those looking for a more complex plot or theme should pass this one up."
5,So sweet and I just really love it.,This book was the first that I ever read. I loved it so much the first time that I read it and I cried so hard in the end. I have never cried to a book before and this book just moved me so much. I really recommend this book. It is a little too hunky dory and perfect but I still love it. The only thing that really bothered me was Erik seemed to be always flirting with Monique and the sensuality and passion was taken out of it. I was really surprised that Christine and Erik even concieved a child!Was this review helpful to you?
4,Jack Black in drag...,"how can you NOT watch the video for ""Low""? Hijinks abound in a hotel room as truckers Dave Grohl and Jack Black get sloppy drunk and slip into wigs and ladies' lingerie. Good for a laugh but kinda disturbing after a while. Three versions of ""Times like These""--one we've seen a million times, a UK version that is (...)[not so good] and a decent acoustic version. Still...Dave Grohl in suspenders and a blonde wig is well worth the price."
1,misleading....deceptive...not for hand knitters!,"I knit a lot and was interested in a book to bring my skills to wire. I bought this book thinking, reasonably, that this book would help.You should know that the lovely pieces in this book were almost all machine knit. There are only a few pieces that were knit by hand....and none of the great pieces.Absolutely skip this book unless you have a knitting machine and are interested in this technique for that purpose. Had the book been called ""Machine Knitting with Wire"" I'd have had no complaint. I'd have not bought the book."
4,Focus on spontaneous communication,"An excellent practical guide from some of the people at the legendary TEACCH. It focuses on developing spontaneous, functional communication, as opposed to teaching ""speech"" in a rote manner which children with autism may then not be able to use to communicate. Although evidently primarily designed for schools, this book will also be useful to parents who want to increase their child's communication skills at home.It's not a ""flashy"" book - an unassuming ring-bound volume, with no claims of ""miracle cures"" inside, clearly written and dogma-free - but it's one that I've found myself referring to regularly in my work with autistic children."
3,Autisms.org Book Review,This text presents a communication curriculum designed for children who have language skills ranging from a few words to simple sentences. The book identifies a system for assessing and teaching various communication skills to students with Autistic Spectrum Disorders.
4,"Nice Player, Nice Price","I've had this player for a few months now. Overall, I am pleased with it. The software has a few bugs in it but, you figure them out pretty quickly and figure out how to work around them. The player itself has only one problem I've found. Sometimes if you're playing a song and decide to switch to another song from your library it won't play it. You just have to press play one more time and it will work. Really not a big deal at all. Also, it transfers songs very quickly. It is definately bigger than an ipod but, the price isn't. I figure it is still very small compared to the books of 600 CD's I used to carry around. It is definately a good buy any way you look at it."
1,The unknown situation,"The product works perfectly, the problem is related with another issue. The Creative Nomad mp3 has no comptaibility with the new windows softwares, (vista, W7), so although everything seems to work well i can't use my mp3 player because i can't plugged it to my pc, in fact it is not recognize.Things like this must be said in the description of the product in order i can analyze the benefits or disadvantage of the product.Its a shame, i wasted u$s 90 for nothing.pd: Drivers to solve this problem are imposible to find, and the ones that comes with the purchase does not work."
1,Hard Drive Failed - no warranty,"I bought this player 6 months ago. The hard drive failed and I sent it back for service. Creative quoted $180 to repair the unit and refused to perform the work under warranty. They admitted the failure was not due to our abuse. The only warranty you get is 3 months, after that - tough. This company does not stand behind their products."
3,Great... until it stops working.,"I have had this mp3 player for less than a year and twice I have had to send it back for ""hardware problems"". Creative is great about sending back a completely new one in record time, so that is definitely a plus, but I would rather have an mp3 player that doesn't break down on me every few months. When it is working, it works great and the storage capacity is awesome (especially for the price!). I would recommend this mp3 player for those who don't mind having to send it back every few months for repairs."
1,Caveat Emptor - Buyer Beware,"Please Don't buy this product unless you plan on working pro bono as a tech for yourself on behalf of creative. The Player will eventually freeze up and attempts to fix officially using creative updated ""play for sure"" firmware software will ""destroy your player for sure"". Simple. I just wish i had read a little about this before attempting to upgrade the software and i might have salvaged what little was left of the player. The good reviews are simply from people who just haven't heard trouble with their products, It's not a question of if but when. You've been warned."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I did a lot of research for an MP3 player for my 12 year old. This product is GREAT:) The whole family uses it. My 12 year old can use it with now problem. I purchased this for under $200.00. 40 GB for less than 200. That is AWESOMW!! I did not want to spend 300.00 for a 12 year old, so I went with this product after researching and talking to people. We are all VERY satisfied. It stored everyones music collection (even my 4 & 5 year olds). I recommend this product for anyone who just wants to listen to music."
2,Creative Support Sucks,"I have one of these, and i am on my 3rd time trying to get it fixed. the hard drive has issues. first one locked up completely no warning. the replacement, stopped playing, then the replacement for the replacement right out of the box from creative wouldn't even power up and i can't even get them to send me a replacement for the one that was bad that they sent to me.on a good note. i can say that once u figure out how the software works it is a very good player to have. lots of songs held, but when it crashes better have backups cause u r going to lose everything."
4,"good unit, two months of use","I got this player just before christmas and have been using is every day. I have not had any of the problems that people list here: my cover has never come off and have had NO problems witih the software.This is my first mp3 player: I used windows media to rip a lot of my cds. I have 357 on there so far, I have a stack of 50 or so more to go. I had no problem losing artist, track, song information. I have MANY different versions of the same song by the dead and phish.The player keeps them well organized.Playlists are not easy to create on the fly on the player. They're easy enough to create using the jukebox software.You can set the back light time and auto off feature - which is usefull so I don't run the battery down.My only complaint is the scroll wheel. It is a little hard to highlight and select items from the menus - it does take a little practice and I am getting better at it."
1,Don't be fooled by the 5 star reviews...,"I read the terrific reviews and decided to purchase Creative NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player for myself, thinking I was getting an excellent deal. Yes, the storage capacity was great- but that's about all. When I first purchased it, it worked like a charm. But after the first couple months, it no longer was recognized on my computer. It said that the device was not plugged in, although it was. I tried restarting, charging the battery all the way, trying different USB ports and cables, and just about any other thing that I could think of. It plays the files that are currently stored on it fine, but now I can't add any new ones, defeating the purpose of my buying it in the first place."
1,Xtra Expensive POS,"I bought a Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 60GB player in December 2003. The headphone jack immediately failed within the 1st month, even though I took extra care in handling this unit, always had it in its protective case, and never dropped it. I received a replacement unit from Creative and wouldn't you know it, the headphone jack once again failed. Thanks for a previous review from ""seleniumdream"". I will be doing my own maintenance on the headphone jack since it is now out of warranty. Bummer that I didn't stumble across these reviews on this unit earlier. Now I only wonder if the hard drive is going to fail like so many other reviewers have experienced. The only good thing that could come from buying this unit is that hopefully it malfunctions within the 90 day warranty. If you want a good MP3 player buy any other unit except this one."
3,good but not great,i bought the 4o gb xtra 1 year ago. i thought it was great till i realized it wasn't amzing.don't get me wrong its just that it does hte job but not well enough. i took perfect care of it. but afer 8 months it started freezing. then it went out completely. it wouldn't play at all. then i called creative and they told me it would cost 150 bucks to repair. they think it is a loose headphone jack. im MAD do ureself a favor get an i river or an ipod
1,"bought it liked it, but trashed it","i bought this along time ago and had it a good while, but one day it fell in the toilet yes i know, it was in my pocket and fell out and boom short circut but it was awsome lol."
4,2 broken ipods = should have gone with nomad,"Ah, Apple. Why so highly lauded? Maybe because their supporters are very computer illiterate? Been a PC person all my life. Finally gave in and got the ipod. hard drive failed. the second one's okay, but the headphones are literally falling apart. my wife's ipod mini has a noisy (i.e. static click/pop in the headphones?!) but is out of warranty. also consider the ipod must be returned to apple to replace the battery every 3 years, are you kidding??! no. i think for the price, these are crap. go with the nomad. same functions and features for 20% less, and you can replace the battery yourself. ;)"
1,4 strikes,"Having given 4 of these players as gifts, it is disheartning to have all of them to require service within 6-8 months. Total lack of quality and reliablity, plus customer service that really suks. Wish I had looked else where for players."
1,Please do not buy this item,"The creative labs Zen Xtra 40gb, 30gb and 60gb have a known issue with their latest version of firmware. During the download of the firmware your PC will freeze. You will need to reboot. Once you reboot, your Zen Xtra will never come back on again. The support staff at creative can not or will not fix this issue. Posts on their support forums go back over 1 yr. No official statement has been released and no work around has been issued. The customer support tells you to mail the device bak to them with a $27 fee foe evaluating the issue. Eventually, usually at least 1 month, you will be sent a refurbished device with the exact same issue. After several attempts you will probably find one that works, just be sure not to do any more firmware. I have not been so lucky. I now have a 40gb paper weight!!"
1,Many Problems even with newer model,"This player is awesome, till you own it for about 5 months. Interface, sound, all that is excellent. Yet the headphone jack is just not secure. You will start to lose sound in either the left or right headphone, then both. Also, instead of reinforcing it with a brace, they have it completely soldered into the board for support so when it comes up it rips the board. I've checked all over the internet and this happens with everyones player. so be careful, all their other models look excellent and do not have this problem, buy a different model. Oh, this one starts freezing really bad if you load over 20gigs of songs onto the hard drive"
5,"Yeah, we all know the proprietary soft ware sucks....","...but that's really the only problem i've had with my Zen. the people docking it multiple stars for that reason alone are ridiculous.first of all, those who are saying you have to use Creative's proprietary software are idiots. I'm not sure about Macs, but you can definitely transfer files through Windows Explorer just by dragging and dropping. It's not exactly ideal, but it does work.secondly, if you really find the software that cumbersome and don't want to transfer through Windows, Red Chair Software has an excellent product called Notmad Explorer that is available for fairly cheap (it was only $20 when i purchased it about a year ago) from their website. much more intuitive and solid than Creative's program."
5,Great Product...,"I have had this unit for about 9 months, and love it... use it a lot, dropped it, still flawlessly playing music... controls are easy to manipulate, interface is dead simple, computer connection and software are smooth and fluid... I strongly recommend this player."
5,the coolest ever,I was so worried when I bought this because I thought Oh my god what if it doesn't work and the reviews didn't help much either! I just got done charging it and now have put all my songs (1000) in in just 20 minutes. It was easy though getting it installed was hard because it said windows would bring it up and it didn't but one phone call ended that. The sound on it is wonderfull and I am so happy I never have to buy another pack of CD-R's.Worth every penny-including the extra warranty you can get at best buy...I leave no room for error!
2,"ehh, OK at first","i bought this mp3 player back in August and it was working perfectly fine and the music uploaded <u>very</u> fastexcept that some of the albums i uploaded weren't in the correct order and i hated the fact that there was a little skip/pause in between songs (which ruined listening to 'Frances The Mute')after a month or two, it started to freeze for some times. now, it doesn't even work. i had only dropped it once and that was a while before it had stopped working. there are major hard disk problems and it won't let me clean in out.you'd be better off with one of those new, spiffy iPods."
3,battery failed too,"I would have given the MP3 a 4 stars because overall it works really well. We've got more than 700 CDs and put most of them on the machine with ease. But after 7 months of usage the battery completely died on us. One day it was working fine and the next it wouldn't take any charge. It was as if there were no battery at all. We're going to try to buy a new one. We'll see how that goes considering Creative's consumer service reputation. Since I haven't tried anything else, I can't recommend another model."
5,An excellent informative comprehensive book on lymphedema.,"This book confirms what took many hours of searching on my own time to comprehend the complications and control of lymphedema, a medical condition I was not forewarned might develop following breast surgery. I highly recommend this book to any person facing surgery and/or radiation involving lymph nodes as well as anyone who currently has lymphedema."
2,Reader wanted more,"This book gave some helpful hints on dealing with the emotions I was having when my arm swelled after treatment for breast cancer, but seemed to say I was just going to have to learn to live with it. In spite of a good resource section, the book left me depressed and feeling hopeless. I have since found another book I use as a ""how to"" guide and I am managing the selling very well. If you are like me, ""Coping with Lymphedema"" may not be the most helpful book for you."
4,Very informative,"A great read for both the practitioner and for patients learing to deal with this challenging condition. Will use again, I'm sure."
5,Lymphedema,I bought this book to get an idea as to what to expect with my lymphedema that suddenly developed 1 1/2 years after breast cancer surgery. I've looked through it & it seems to contain a lot of information.
1,Don't buy this one,"This monitor is annoying for all the reasons listed in other reviews (beeping, frequent signal loss, bright light at night), but also because there are only a few sound levels you can choose. I'd like to turn the volume down more (but not completely off), but the lowest level it allows is still too loud. Moreover, I've only owned it for 15 months (my baby's age), and it just broke (the button to turn it on and off is stuck and won't allow me to turn it on). Although I don't think it's necessarily the best, the monitor we use for our other child, a Sony, is much better than this one."
2,Eh... ok.,"This unit has some good features. Such as the 'lost signal' beeping that the other reviewer complained about. I'd rather it give me annoying beeps than have my baby unattended without knowing it. It comes with the visual monitor and the units turn on and off by HOLDING the button for a few seconds. Keeps our active baby from Kicking and turning it off.Things I DON'T like about it is the signal quality. It stops and goes 'silent' for a half a second every 15 seconds or so and it's annoying. The night light feature is REALLY BRIGHT. Seriously... it lights up a corner of the room by itself. We have to cover it with a cloth cover so the baby can sleep. Also this is on the 2.4 mhz range. That MIGHT be the reason for the 'silent' stutter. Also periodically it will break out into an ear piercing feedback squeel for no reason and we need to turn the monitor off then back on.You're probably better served going with another brand, but it does the job."
2,I do not recommend this monitor,"I purchased this monitor because I thought it was recommended by Consumer Reports. It worked, but I agree with all of the negative comments regarding poor sound level adjustment, noisy beeping, etc. The on/off button stuck on mine, too, after only about three months (right about the time the warranty expired)."
2,eats batteries,I am very unhappy with this monitor. I can't turn the receiver on very easily and it has an annoying beep when the signal is lost. The receiver also looses the signal very easily.
2,Star Wars Rip-Off,"This toy was just a sad rip-off of a star wars racer, I even think they used the same pieces from their Star Wars line. The packaging was cool and it looked like it would be a good toy for my little cousin Andrew, but he was pretty disappointed with it once he got the box open. Not much play value in this EXO-Force stuff."
2,Poor guide for a great game...,"When I got this book and first looked in it, I was surprised to see how many mistakes there were. A lot of charts are wrong, it's missing a lot of important info, it doesn't tell you one of the most important keys to a succesful game, etc., etc. The list goes on and on. But, I must admit that when I've been stuck, it's come through for me. Plus, the maps are a great help. But even with that, this guide deserves no more than two stars."
5,Classic Guide for a Classic Game!,"If you haven't heard, this is one of the best games ever, regardless of console! It's so big it never hurts to have a strategy guide that actually enhances your play through of this game."
5,Easy to Use,Great to keep in the car. No folding and refolding issues. I have these for several states. Well worth the money.
4,HE-MAN SERIES,I BELIVE IN RECYCLING ANYTHING THAT IS IN GOOD SHAPE YET. I ORDERED A HE-MAN VHS TAPE. IT WAS IN GOOD SHAPE AND PLAYED FINE. I WILL PROBABLY ORDER AN ENTIRE SEASON THE NEXT TIME ON A DVD AS THE VHS TAPE HAD ONLY TWO EPISODES ON IT. IT IS TOO MUCH MONEY IF I HAVE TO ORDER TWO EPISODES AT A TIME FOR VHS FORMAT. THE DVD'S HAVE A WHOLE SEASON ON ONE DVD AND THE SHIPPING FOR ONE DVD IS NOT THAT MUCH. BUT ALL IN ALL THE TAPE WAS ONLY 5.00 PLUS 3.00 SHIPPING.
5,Cure for the Bored,"My classroom has children from 1st-3rd grade. It is always a challenge to find problem solving activities that young children can do independently or with a small group that is challenging but not presented in a way that is intimidating. This book has 91 pages of logic and deductive reasoning that is elementary friendly. The workspace is large enough for young writers to fit their answers. Students should have a working knowledge of odd, even and the concept of addition of multiple addends. This makes great homework pages for the child who already has mastered the skill you're teaching!!!"
4,"So far, so good!","I purchased this just over a month ago and I'm off to a good start. My main reason for buying this is that my cat was not drinking enough water. I was told that she would more than likely drink more if I bought her a fountain-like device like this one. Well, she's definitely drinking more water as she seems amused by this fountain. I've read all of the reviews on here and luckily my Fresh Flow is very quiet. So far it's a success and I will update this review at a later time....hopefully it will be a similar review."
4,"Good product, but cat barely uses it","I've had no problems with the fountain. It works fine. It isn't too hard to clean. The pump works and only makes a little noise that you can't hear unless you go near it and listen for it. But my cat only drinks from it half of the time or less. I don't know why she doesn't like it (it doesn't splash or leak or anything like other reviews had said); she prefers to drink from her regular bowl, though. Possibly she just needs time to readjust. People have suggested that I get rid of the other bowl to make her drink from the fountain. But she will go next to her bowl and meow until I fill it again."
1,Too much cleaning,"I love my cats and tend to buy way too many things they don't need. Once I saw one of these, I couldn't resist the urge to get it.- Cleaning. If I knew how often you have to clean this thing, I would have never bought it. There are way too many small spaces to try and get to. I don't know about you, but I simply don't have enough time once a week to frustrate myself in the kitchen.- Overflow. At first, it was fine...then it would pump way too much or way too little water. It would leak onto the floor, which then caused my cats to never go near it.- Noise. I hate that constant grinding noise. So annoying.From my experience, I have found that all the fountains for cats tend to be too hard to clean and end up causing more problems than they are worth. I just go with the giant bottled water and a dish I fill up every morning. So much easier."
1,Disappointed,"At first, I was delighted with this product. Until I realized that a great deal of mold builds up at the base and where the water filters out. I tried to clean it, but to no avail. I would defintely go with another type of water filtration for your pet..."
2,gets gross,"the cat did like it, but eventually we threw it out because it gets really disgusting and it was a pain to clean"
1,"Too loud for me, let alone the cat","Length:: 0:37 MinsIt's a good looking device, seems like the cat may have eventually gotten interested in it, but it's incredibly loud. We set it up in our kitchen, and it was like a meat-grinder running 24/7.I suppose if you could put it in the garage or somewhere where you couldn't hear it, it would be OK. But I could hear it running overnight, two rooms away in the bedroom when our place was quiet.We couldn't handle it and returned it.Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow Pet Fountain Medium, Black/Stainless"
1,Loud and Overflowed,"The device vibrated and made an annoying sound. It didn't scare off my cat, but it annoyed me. After a while I started to get used to it and would have kept this product, except that it started to overflow. This happened to me twice and I just returned it. I may have gotten a bad one, but I was not pleased with this water dish."
3,Works for short term Water needs,"We initially used this for daily water needs for our cat, but it is a lot of work to keep clean and the water in good condition. Plan on cleaning this every 5-7 days (the whole unit). Now we use this when we are out of town so our cat has fresh water the whole time. This way we do not have to keep cleaning it on a weekly basis. Works great for this application! not sure i would recommend this for everyday use 24/7/365...."
1,"Too loud, gets dirty very easily","I bought this for my two cats. Out of the box, it was very loud. I kept it for a couple of weeks to see if it would get any better, but it continued to be quite loud and became visibly dirty very easily. I sent this back to amazon and bought the Drinkwell Platinum Pet fountain instead. It is completely silent and thus far seems to only require a once per week cleaning. I would strongly recommend that product over this one."
2,Not Great,"I purchased this product based on reviews, however I was not satisfied. It was incredibly loud and the continuous motor sound made it impossible to be anywhere near it. I'm not sure what discouraged my cat from using it, perhaps it was also the sound, but he wanted no part of this drinking fountain."
2,Not so good,"This produce is not so good.The stainless steel is only on 2 small panels, and one is only for show.The motor clogs up too fast.It does the job, but it is poorly made."
2,8 months in - and it's dead,"Sigh - I am now on my 8 month and 3rd Petmate fountain and have had the same issue with this fountain as I have had with the previous 2. The motor is running, but no water is coming out of the top. I have tried using with and without the filter, I have cleaned it once a week, I have even tried turning it off at regular intervals to see if it was because it was being over taxed, but nothing is helping. I am shortly going to be throwing this thing out and trying a Drinkwell.I only give it two stars instead of one because at least it looks nice in black."
2,Don't waste your money,"I know you're looking for a product that will keep the water fresh for your pet but this is not the way to go. I bought one of these for my dog months ago, and eventually he got used to drinking from it. Sure, it's true that when the water runs low it makes a noise similar to having an old Ford pickup truck running in your kitchen, but I can move past this. The water is still exposed to stuff falling in it (like pet hair) and the filter won't clean it out. The filter should be cleaned at least every two weeks, the bowl should be cleaned at least every two days, and even still this product will develop mildew on the inside within the first four months. After several attempts to scrub the mildew out of the inside container (I won't use it with mildew, of course) I wrote to the company letting them know. It's been several months and still no response."
3,Nice but high maintenance,Our cats like the unit. The waterers are very high maintenance. You must disassemble at least every other week and use tiny brushes to remove the buit up slime. Also remove the pump and carefully clean the intake screen which gets clogged with hair and pet food that our kitties leave behind.We have a lot of minerals in our water so I use straight white vinegar every other week on it. I fill it and let it recirculate for a couple of hours to dissolve the lime and other minerals. If you do the regular maintenance the unit is great. Cats need lots of fresh water to avoid kidney problems and this unit does the trick. We also run the filters in our dishwasher to extend their life.
1,Petmate Deluxe,"I am not impressed with this item at all. It stated that it was a deluxe so I though it would be large, but I have two cats and would never be able to go off for a few days knowing they were going to have water for that time. I constantly have to fill the storage container."
2,Scary,"My dogs were afraid of it. It was to noisy for them, even on low flow. They were afraid of the reflection in the Stainless."
5,We Just Love This...,"This is our third bubbler in the last 10 years... my Billy Jean just loves drinking the water as it comes down the chute... now with the pink one, she's now accessorized too. GREAT PRODUCT! Just keep up with cleaning it regularly, sometimes the cat hair can clog the pump and start to make noise, so you can stick the whole thing in the diswasher and clean the pump under running water."
2,Not stainless steel,This pet drinking fountain should not be listed under Stainless Steel. The entire appliance is plastic except for a decorative metal strip affixed to the front. I already have a plastic pet fountain and was looking for a metal one. Disappointed.
2,Great at first,"I bought this for a cat who wouldn't stop drinking out of the toilet. I assumed that he was looking for the coldest possible water. At first, he seemed to like this fountain, but after a while, I caught him drinking out of the toilet again. Obviously, that's a behavior issue. But this fountain turned out to be more trouble than it's worth. Despite the reservoir, it would often start making gasping noises which indicated it needed to be refilled. These noises freaked the cat out. I needed to clean cat hair out of the bowl every other day and today, when I went to clean it out, I noticed that there was mold growing in the crevasses. There was no discernible way to take it apart and take care of that so I have no choice but to get rid of it and go back to the bowl. I doubt my cat will notice the difference. Maybe they should invent a pet fountain shaped like a toilet bowl."
3,Petmate Pet Fountain,"My cat loves this thing! The moving water feature naturally attracts him to it. It does require a bit more maintenance than I thought it would. The pump clogs quickly with cat hairs that have fallen into fountain, and it must be removed and cleaned. Keeping it filled with water is fairly easy and can be done 2 different ways."
4,Clicking,"Even though my cats were afraid of it at first it works rather well. Unfortunately if it isn't filled all the way, the water reserve fogs and looks unkept. Also when it's not completely full it produces this annoying clicking sound. It has a very small reserve and needs to be refilled often so the clicking can get to be constant. Other than that, it's very nice looking and matches with the stainless items in my kitchen."
3,Good idea if my cat wasn't afraid of it...,"So, I bought this product my my cat, Einstein. He was recently diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Failure, so I wanted to encourage him to drink more water. So far, he's doing o.k., but as far as the fountain...nothing. He will look at it and get close to it, but it's been a few weeks and thus far, not one drink. I even put treats around the edge for him. He ate the treats, but still, not one sip of the water. So, I'll keep it around and perhaps eventually he'll get used to it. It's a great idea if your cat isn't stubborn :)"
1,"These are loud, faulty, and in general junk.","Sure the cat likes drinking flowing water over stagnant. I get that. But the motor here is very sensitive to water levels as the design of this item is very poor/inefficient and it has to be refilled constantly. Even when it gets filled its very loud and in general annoying. When the water gets low and the motor is sucking wind it's like an alarm, but a very annoying one. Nothing worse than in the middle of the night this thing starts making noise because it can't and won't shut off."
1,"False Advertising, loud and leaks","I bought this as a birthday present for my cat as he loves water and I thought a fountain would make him really happy. Well, it does make my cat happy but not me. Why?1. The fountain leaks, they molded stainless steel decorations on it, and the screw holes allow water to leak through the unit. At first I used a towel, but the next day the towel was soaked through. Then, I put a platic tray underneath it and the next morning the whole tray was full of water.2. It is not whisper quiet. It sounds like a cheap aquarium pump. It is loud enough to hear at night 2 rooms away with the door closed.3. Construction was shoddy, there is no reason why this thing should leak water, WOW was a letdown!4. At least my cat likes it. The noise doesn't bother him, but since I still need to change the water everyday I am going to return this unit for false advertising and mainly because it leaks."
3,Great Picture . . . but,"This HDTV does have a great picture but the assembly instructions are poor and don't plan on using it in a bedroom. There are several on-screen steps to get to the sleep timer, and then hope it takes the program and works. Not fun when all you want to do is watch the news and go to sleep. I had to return it and buy a Sony; just push the sleep button once for each 15 minutes you want on the timer!"
1,Magnavox stop Ripping people off!!!!!,My 37 in.with built in dvd Magnavox is only 18 months old and it won't turn on.I have 5 very dissapointed children.THe red light stays on but the TV won't turn on.Can anyone help me with the problem .From what I have been reading this is a common problem with the Magnavox.Is there a recall?Is there a fix that I can try..?ThankYou so much for your help.JP
1,Breaks down every year,I bought this 2 years ago and had to have it repaired twice now. All in all I have been without a TV 9 weeks out of the 2 years waiting for parts and repair. It does have a beautiful pitchure when its working BUT when its working is the key. Im very very disapointed with this TV
1,Dies after less than three years,"My husband and I purchased this TV from Sears about three years ago. About six months ago the screen would randomly go blank while watching TV and then come back on by itself. We also began to notice that you had to push the ""power"" button more than once to get the TV to even turn on. Now the screen often goes blank and doesn't come back. Usually unplugging/replugging fixes that. Also, the TV now has bouts where it won't even come on. We've unplugged it and replugged it and it just refuses to come on. Come back in an hour or so, push power about 8 times and it may decide to work. I bought a 5 year warranty for the TV, so we have been going back and forth with Sears trying to get parts to repair it (backordered until who knows when) or just replace it. After reading some of these reviews, we are hoping for a non-Magnavox replacement! We will NOT be buying another Magnavox."
5,Learn by Example,"The strategies and patterns mentioned in the book are really helpful. They improve the object think. The examples explain the author's point of view clearly. This book complements other books in OOAD and patterns by Craig Larmen, GoF, Martin Fowler etc.One interesting point is that the author shows how same strategy or pattern helps in design in various problems. Most of the books do not show this. For beginners, it is often difficult to grasp a strategy or pattern with just one example.One drawback is it uses UML notation very less. But Coad notation is simple and we can easily grasp to understand the diagrams in the book. If you want to learn from solid examples, this is a good choice. If you are very new to OOAD, this is NOT the one you can start with."
5,Un Amigo Mio,"Aunque nunca tuve la oportunidad de oir a Vallejo en vivo, el se ha convertido en mi bolerista favorito, junto con el Beny."
1,Fast and Furious,"I did not like this exercise video! I have Richard Simmons ""Sweating to the Oldies"", which is pretty good. The songs are old, but recognizable, so I thought I would like this one. Not!!! On ""Sixties Blast Off"" the songs are real 'old foggie' songs, real old school rock and roll, and not good ones. If you're under the age of 55 (I'm 48) you probably won't like or recognize any of these songs. Also, I found the routines fast and furious w/o alot of direction before a move change, and there were alot of move changes. You didn't know whether to kick, punch, move left, right, forward, backward, turn, cha-cha, arms up, arms down. It was crazy!!!! I'm in pretty good shape and have been exercising regularly for quite some time and wanted to add something different to my routine, but it's not going to be this. You probably could catch on after the 4th or 5th time, IF you like the music. I was dissappointed with this video."
5,Richard Simmons 60's Blast Off,"Love the songs and energy, great workout when you don't have a lot of time."
2,Not so pleased,"I received the video tape on a timely manner, and it arrived it perfect condition. Now I love Richard Simmons, but this particular workout felt that it was all over the place. It was not easy to follow like the first video tape he made, working out to the oldies, which was fun and inspiring. I will probably not use this work out video tape of the 60's Blast off again."
3,Disappointed,"I had purchased his tapes in the past and I enjoyed them more than this one. This is much shorter in length, and I miss the live band and the more involved Richard that was in the earlier tapes."
3,Richard Simmons 60's Blast off,"I like the music, I like the 30 minute workout before work. It is a fast pace fun workout.The dancers ar very energetic and Richard is fun. The thing I do not like is the poor quality of the video. It isn't done by the same company as the sweatin to the oldies and the quality is poor and sometimes blurry.I did not feel it was really worth the money I spent on it due to the poor quality of the filming."
5,Love it,"I love Richard Simmons stuff since I did with my friend's gramma when we were 12...lolHe's so inspirational and enthusiastic, this video is totally fun and nerdy. Perfect for me :)"
1,Not for people who regularly exercise,"This is advertised as 30 minutes, but it's only 20 minutes of exercise and 10 minutes of cool down. Very hard to follow since there's no cuing and camera regularly focuses on people's faces just as Richard is doing a new move. The creative cinematography sometimes blurs (I guess to show people are moving) but it's very disconcerting when you're trying to follow along. I'll try this a few more times but it definitely is not for people who appreciate a really good workout."
3,Get's the job done,"The video got me up and moving as I had hoped it would do. The music was lame, so if you are hoping for the real 60's sound, skip this."
1,Horrible!,"This dvd is horrible! First of all i am so disapointed! I thought hey richard simmons can't go wrong with that choice. Boy was i wrong! The company that filmed the true 60's oldies focused on mostly the womens big faces. So, where am getting extremely hard to follow! When you think your right your not! I don't recommend it! Also, the music choice is very poor! None energetic songs from the early 60's it smeems. I love 60's music i thought i heard those songs, but i was wrong. They must be the ones that didn't become popular. I would have never thought richard simmons could get so much love and energy from cheesie 60's music.I do recommend. Winsor Pilates maximun burn.Sara Ivanhoe's 20min yoga makeover for weightloss.Belly Dance fitness for weight loss pure sweat featuring rania.Island Girl dance fitness workoutfor beginners hula abs and buns with kili.Mostly all also have for low impact."
4,Gives you a real workout!,"I am enjoying this DVD. Each song is longer than the original, I think... so you don't realize how long you are exersizing. I will be buying more Richard Simmons!"
2,Too short,This tape is only about 30 minutes long so it's not a very good value.They show the other people too often so that it is hard to follow at first. They show the people smiling and having fun but fail to show you what the moves are.
3,Fun!,"I had alot of fun exercising to this CD, only my livingroom wasn't big enough for both my husband and I to exercise together!"
5,Excellent book!,An excellent book which shows that alternative treatment for cancer has been 'well documented' in the past!
5,"Purchase experience with ""A Cancer Therapy""","With one of every two predicted to get cancer these days, and my family and friends pretty accurate proof of it, I have no doubt anyone doing research about this modern man's scourge will come across the Gerson Therapy videos on YouTube. I was pleased to be able to find it so easily and that it was readily available."
4,if youve seen the movie,now read the bookgiven as a giftto father who survived prostate cancerhe wants to adopt a healthier lifestyle so he doesnt get any other cancers
2,Difficult to read but excellent.,"This author lays out very compelling informations with regards to alternative treatments to cancer and desease. His observations and hypothoses are way ahead of his time. This book was written in the 50's but is even more relavent today. If you are a cancer patient or have a close friend fighting cancer, this book offers an alternative."
1,charlatan,"I could not even see one case of ""cure"" in this charlatan style book. No pathological study before and after . Maybe he was a very good man but style is nothing but give hope and get a check go home."
4,Recommended by my chiropractor,"This pillow is comfortable and great for my sleeping posture. It allows me to sleep on my back and on my side. Even when I'm sleeping on my back, I can put some pressure on the sides of my head because the sides of the pillow are raised. The only problem with this pillow is that it is way too big to travel with. I'm planning on purchasing the travel size one as well."
3,Duplicate Walk,"Do not buy this video if you already have the ""Express"" videos. Because it was being marketed as a ""new release"" for September 2003, I ordered it thinking I would be getting a completely new 2 mile video. It is IDENTICAL to the first BRISK WALK 2 MILE video in the EXPRESS series. The only difference is the video box and the ""as seen on tv"" logo. I am not happy that I wasted my money."
3,"This book is a little too ""rough.""","I was planning a honeymoon to St. Lucia, however, this book actually made me change my mind! It included reports of Dengue Fever, documented poisonous tree sap, stated that the roads and many of the tourist sights are dangerous & rickety, and also boasted polluted rivers and waterfalls. Although I am not entirely sure about the truth of the text, I don't want to risk it and find out that the book was true. I didn't want to give it a 5 for truth telling, however, I didn't want to give it a 1 for scaring me away from the island...so I'll settle for a 3, you decide for yourself!"
2,Screeching weasel side is good. the Born against side has,"Screeching weasel side is good, the born against side has one good song, and that is Janelle. The rest of the songs suck"
3,Par for the course,"This book is not as in depth as the original Core Java. It covers the awt graphics class, which is ok, but it is not the focus of the JFC. Discussion on Graphics 2D could have been more useful. More in depth coverage of event models and custom components for advanced user interfaces is needed. Instead The ""advanced topics"" cover particular components (ie, text, trees, tables, internal frames) and a short discussion on the PLAF."
2,lacked information on the needed basics of java,"I am a 3rd-year computer science major, so I have a lot of experience in programming, however if this is your first Java book I don't recommend it. I get frustrated using it as a new Java programmer. The book and CD-ROM don't cover basic Java features that I find I always use. The book mostly goes over examples and explains how they work. And none of the programs in the book have comments next to them that explain what exactly the lines of code do. However, the good aspects are that 1.)it is easy to read and 2.) it explains the new Swing and JDK 1.2 features very nicely."
5,Great JFC Book,"Outstanding. I was a beginner with Java & JFC. This book took me through intermediate & up to expert level. JFC underlying structure is explained early on. Each new component family is explained in great detail & lots of high-quality examples. I am a very tough critic when it comes to these sw books, and this was the first one I actually wanted to write the author & thank him/her for such a great job. I couldn't stop reading it! This book is true gold. Only negatives: some minor typos; covered beta of JFC (swing) so once in a while an api changed - this did not hinder the effectiveness of the book (just refer to the Java API when in doubt)."
5,An excellent tutorial for Swing programming.,"This is by far the best book on Swing I have seen. It covers all of the subjects I would expect to see and more. The sections on JTree and JTable were particularly helpful.Clear examples are given throughout which is essential in a book of this type. The only thing missing is Swing for JDK 1.1 on the CD, although it is included for 1.2."
4,Lots of great info but flawed by the 'rush to market',"This book has a lot of info and has been very helpful. I would recommend it as one of the best JFC books out there right now. It is amazing how much information Mr. Topley has gotten into this book so quickly. All is not perfect with this book however. There are a great number of typographical errors that make me think that not too many eyes read this book before it was published.There are some gaps (I haven't found any information on how to make sortable columns in a JTable for example).The biggest flaw, IMHO is the failure to address multi-threading issues until Appendix B. Mr Topley opens this appendix by saying that some of the examples given previously in the book had bugs. I get the feeling that Mr. Topley didn't really know about the Swing threading issues until the book was completed, and had to quickly add this appendix to patch things up.Despite this, this book is worth the read. I am sure Version 1.1 of this volume will be better."
4,Definately not a waste of money,There aren't many JFC books available. I think this one will be up there among the best. It doesn't waste time covering basic Java topics and covers JFC well. Using this book together with the online documentation you should be OK.
5,Precious,"I don't know what Wayne Dyer has to do with this DVD, as I haven't noticed anything of his contribution, but Louise Hay has done great job. I bought this DVD for myself and my son, because her book with the same title had turned my life around in the mid 90s. It was a bible to me. I didn't just read it, I inhaled and absorbed every sentence several times. I strongly recommend the book and this video. You just need to know that they're not to be read or watched once and put away. You need to really work with this material and apply it in your life."
3,some good some bad,"there are a few great tracks on here, but the album has a whole is weighed down by some songs which just plain leave you wanting to skip tracks and end the agony.A decent collection of mixes but not one to go on my short list of favs."
3,Standard,"Pretty typical set for Farina and as usual, never as good as a live set. Some great tracks and programming is pretty good."
4,D.O. cooking is fun,D.O. cooking is fun and delicious. Great for the men learning to cook also.This large size is wonderful for large family gatherings. great quality.very satisfied. I order FOUR (gifts for others in family)
5,Great for large families,"Great dutch oven for big groups.I love the duel purpose lid/pan.Keep in mind that it is heavy, you're not going to backpack this anywhere."
4,excited to have a big one,"I gave it four stars because it is imbalanced (heavier on one side of the casting) which gives it a 30 degree lean when hung from a tripod. I don't expect this to change appreciably when it is half full of chili or soup etc, but it might. Besides, I didn't get it to ""hang cook"" anyway. The ""carry is my only concern so I'll simply use the handles on the side! I got it to cook inside of my Chargriller Kamado smoker/oven/grill and it just fits if centered and the lid of the Kamado seals all around. Regardless it is as expected.Tight lid fit, flat lid bottom, good finish. A few pits in the finish but these will fill and patina over in time. The probe orifice is the perfect size to receive my Maverick's Probe too! Can't wait to cook some chili tonight after I re-season the inside with bacon grease and Crisco. I feel more comfortable knowing what it is seasoned with! Thanks for a great product and even better service and shipping!"
2,"Dude, where's my text?","Beautiful-looking book. Nice broad margins, nice clear font. Nice narrow lines, and not too many of them. Not too many pages, either...Wait a minute. I estimate 250-300 words per page x 140 pages. That's something like 40,000 words, tops. Put 12 words on a line and 36 lines on a page (neither of which would be at all unusual) and this book would stretch to all of 90 pages!I know how important it is for academics to publish, but in this case I really think Page Dubois should have held back - maybe until she'd written a whole book."
2,"Nothing to see here, and P.S., Mr. Bloom, he dead","Although we are given to believe that DuBois is mightily upset over those darn conservatives and their dastardly plans (plans which she is both oddly reluctant to describe and/or believes her readers already know about - bad call) for the Classics, by the end of this book, the reader wonders what the fuss is all about. I learned nothing in this book that was either shocking or a surprise. The Greeks enjoyed man-boy love? Women didn't have the same rights as men? (Yet DuBois patently ignores the broad power they held in the domestic arena, which is inexcusable and anti-woman.) Sappho liked women? I already knew all of this through reading the source texts. Finally, DuBois looks absurd through her assertion that Allan Bloom and William Bennett are threats to the Classics or Western Culture. The works she cites are up to 14 years old and nearly forgotten. Much as _Trojan Horses_ will be."
5,von Steuben's Drill Manual,"This copy is a must have reference for any Revolutionary War reenactor or Eighteenth Century history enthusiast. It is an actual copy of the original printing. von Steuben is often called the Father of the modern Army, due to his contributions to our training readiness at Valley Forge encampment 1777-1778.(http://www.nps.gov/vafo/) Required reading for new recruits in the Continental Army of his excellency General George Washington!"
3,"a faithful reproduction, but...","The intriduction to the book was informative and was good to know.The reproduction of the drill information was faithfully reproduced.The problem I had was that I felt this book fell short of its potential. If this book is used as a text to help someone well-versed in the drills, then it fulfills the rquirement. If, however, you are trying to learn or visualize the drills without previous knowledge, then the lack of additional drawings and additional detail is quite apparent."
3,not the best,"this is a nice book, but there are other rhyme dictionaries out that are alot better in my opinion.... but if your looking for something small that will get the simple job done- this is for you...."
2,What ryhmes with dissapointing...,"Kind of disappointing. In the interest of keeping the dictionary small, they limited the amount of words in the dictionary. So if you don't see the word you are trying to rhyme, you have to think of a word that rhymes with it...and look it up. So if you have to think of what word(s) rhyme with the word you are thinking of, you need a rhyming dictionary...wait a minute!!!"
4,Essential Songwriter's Rhyming Dictionary,"This book is a little more complex, but works great for when your brain is just not working!!!!! Just pick a word and go with the basic sound and you have a rhyme!!!!"
3,Handy but lacking,"This is a handy book. It's small and easy to carry around and you can pretty often find what you're looking for in it. It's good if you're browsing for ideas and it has a small section on basic rhyming schemes and useful hints for beginner songwriters.There are some serious drawbacks though. The obvious one is that it's not very big and doesn't have all that many words. Another is that while it lists words in different tenses, it does for some reason not appear to have any words in plural listed. It has 16 rhymes for the word ""star"", but ""stars"" (or any words that rhyme, like cars, bars, etc.) is nowhere to be found.So while this is a handy book for the beginning lyricist, people who are really serious about songwriting should probably go for something more extensive.But then again, it's only 6 bucks. And for 6 bucks it's not a bad book."
4,Easy-to-use Pocket Dictionary For On-the-road-musician,"It's important to mention, that this physically small dictionary has its limitations. The dictionary doesn't cover every aspect on rhyming. But it's not its generally purpose. The book will come in handy for those who want a fast rhyme (or half rhyme) to finish his/her lyrics in a good way. It also have some practical information on songwriting in general. I like this practical book for what it is. Even though it's small, its potential are huge!"
1,Kindle version doesn't work,I am right in thinking that there is no way you can look up a wordAll I get is a message that my search cannot be completed because it has not yet been indexedWhat does this mean?
2,Very little help,As a songwriter I found this of very little help. There are SOOO many more possibilities for rhyme in contemporary music that this book is really only good if you want to know the perfect rhymes for a word.
4,Good Rhyming Reference Booklet.,"Don't be fooled by its small size. inside, it contains a great deal of rhyming words. Good if you are just into songwriting, putting lyrics on your masterpiece or latest hits."
1,Only a starting point,"Be warned - this dictionary only contains words that the editors think are useful in songwriting, therefore far too many words are excluded. Also, a quote from the dictionary - ""Drug and sexual references are kept to a minimum. Obscene words and those words found offensive to particular ethnic groups or religions are also left out"". So you won't find anything in the Kinky Friedman vein here! These two factors - the editors opinion of what might work in a song and what won't, plus their political/social/religious values make it too restrictive. I bought the Kindle version, it doesn't have an alphabetical index. If I'd seen it on a bookshelf and flipped through it I would have given it a miss. There is a short section on various rhyme schemes and some songwriting tips but it is not enough. Only useful as a starting point."
4,Finally!,Lego hasn't put a hospital or ambulance set out since the 1980s so it is nice to see this out. It was easy to put together but as usual I don't like the stickers. I wish Lego would go back to printing them on the pieces. That's always going to be a small gripe of mine though. Oh well. All in all a nice set.
2,Neither fish nor fowl,"While I am a great fan of L.S. Irish as an artist, her newest book falls far short of being of the same caliber as her art. If it is intended for novices, it lack sufficient detail. If it is for intermediate or advanced carvers, it wastes far too many pages on the basics. It has 32 nice patterns which are mostly variations on the theme of old barns in the woods. One of the projects in the book can be downloaded from her website FREE. Last of all, many of the photos are in color. However, it looks as if the photographer used daylight film under incandescent lights because all of the photos are yellow-red. This makes it impossible to appreciate the sections on painting the carvings. All in all, I cannot recommend this book."
5,Very pleased with this book,"I am very pleased with the very fast delivery of this book and feel that it came in excellent condition, hardly knew it was used. This is an excellent book on this topic and was very happy to find one as I think it is out of print."
4,Interesting piece,"This is not the best album by Tuxedomoon. This is not the place to start with Tuxedomoon. But it is good. Seems like it is still not discovered by the world yet, and unfairly underrated.As with their residential friends Tuxedomoon, at the time, built albums around concepts. This conceptual album has many interesting pieces for piano and strings worth a close listening. The melancholic pieces give ear to the typical sound of theirs at the time. In the minus are the samplings which could have been given another makeover or two. Otherwise this set stands out as a steady Tuxedomoon product that suits well within the whole costume of such."
3,Not the beginning,"Be Warned: this is a follow-up (sequel) to Steel Angels (?), which I have not seen. While it claims to stand alone, it does so on one leg. Hence the ""OK"" rating. If it had been clearer about being a sequel, I'd have bought the first series and it may have seemed much better. So if you have seen the first series, ignore this review, if not, get the first series before watching this."
3,Ok anime,The anime was ok but the main character repeated herself way too much and kinda got annoying. Overall it was ok just not quite what I was expecting.
3,An okay anime,"I like the anime, but I wish that there was a happier ending. It was sad that after everything that the 2 heros had went through that the heroine ended up dying or disappearing after she had found her true love. From what I remember it was not a long anime, which sometimes is pretty good, but it was good to watch. I was addicted to it from the beginning, but was kinda disappointed at the end. I am a romantic person, so I love to see anime's where the couples are happily together especially with everything that they have gone through to get to that point in time of happiness."
1,WTF,Ok first off the cover makes it look like its a mech anime but its not its more like armor. I watched the first episode and my god its like nails on a chalkboard. The main girl is soooo stupid and of course she needs to be saved by another girl from a cat girl and she seems to have fallen in love with a guy who does almost nothing. He shows up as the battle is about halfway through on a horse no less and surfs on the armor of the chick who came to save the first chick durring the finishing move and after that I tossed it in to the trash becouse I couldnt toss it in a fire to send it back to hell.
3,It's ok.,"Lots of drama, but cute story. I'm not too big into the lead character, but everyone else made it worth watching."
3,Tip to Kannazuki Fans...,"If you are a Kannazuki fan, you'll be buying this - but beware! This set does NOT come with the cute ""special extras"" we've all watched on youtube; the painting scene, the swimming scene, the shopping for the shell necklace scene. That said, it's a wonderful (but all too brief) glimpse of our Chikane/Himeko reincarnations, suffering through torture where they must protect one another in heartwarming ways. To the non-Kannazuki fan, I would probably pass on this series as a whole, the main characters are fairly blah.."
5,absolutely beautiful.,this book is gorgeous. the photos are amazing and the information is fantastic. i wrote a paper on aldo for a history of modern architecture and got all of the info i needed from this one book. he is an amazing man and this book truly captures his humanitarian essence!!!! love.
4,"Not all that rare, good for new fans","This cd lifts some of the more accessible songs from the bands first 4 cds and throws in a few hard to find b-sides like the otis redding, and the french version of no more affairs. As such it is a handy compilation for newer and casual fans, but arguably the better bargain would be to buy the first two self-titled tindersticks cds outright, since they are both masterpieces and offer most of the songs on donkeys. That said, the band's cover of Pavement's ""HERE"" are what makes this cd essential for die-hard fans, and the Otis Redding cover is nicely done as well."
5,Good addition to any Boheme collection.,This is a lavish productuion worthy of The Met. Both Angela Georghiu and Ramon Vargas perform extremely well. The cafe scene especially was highly entertaining. Musetta gave of her best. The friends sang amusingly and playfully. Do not hesitate - you will enjoy.
4,good but not great,"A nice job by all, but the tenor has zero sex appeal. The best version is still the Met production with Cararras and Stratas. Stratas acts rings around all the other Mimis and actually looks like she is dying!"
3,Can't find the subtitles!,No subtitles! At least I couldn't find them. At the theatre there were subtitles. I miss them!! Someone help if they are there!
4,recommended,"I quite enjoyed this production of La Boheme. It was lavish and even a bit over the top - which only adds to the drama and the glorious music. No, it's not as good as being there in person. But it is plenty good enough to keep me happy until I can get to another live performance. The parts of Rudulpho and Mimi were very well done, as was Musetta. The quality of the recording is significantly better than some of the other operas I have on DVD."
4,Short teen mystery,"Thanks to Puget Sound Council for a review copy. Jen can't get the image of the red-haired man out of her mind--the man she saw dead at a house party. She isn't surprised when a policeman wants to question her about the dead man at three in the morning. Who told the cops she was there? Should she tell what she saw or just keep quiet? Most people at the party probably suspect the same teen that Jen does but no one wants to make a stand against the bully. The writing is authentic to teen voices and emotions. It will be a hit with middle- and high school readers, those who need high interest-low reading level and also those who are looking for a quick mystery, teen drama read."
5,Utility floor mats,"The mats are very nice, but for the utility mats even thou the title is plural you only receive 1. So in order to have for both back seats you need to double the quanity"
2,"Nice floormat (SINGULAR), but title is deceptive.","Wish I'd read these other reviews here, as I'm not the first to note this. The title of this item is deceptive. It states ""floormatS"" (PLURAL!), but it's definitely not plural. You only get one floormat. Like someone else said, who would buy only one one floormat? It's almost as bad as buying one shoe instead of a pair.I am only giving this 2 stars because I'm twerked about the quantity issue. That said, the quality of the floormat does seem fine and I'm pleased with that end of it."
5,Big Windup is Super Special Awesome!,"I just fell in love with this anime, especially considering that I have played fastpitch softball since I was young, and even though baseball and softball are very different, I found a lot of things that I could apply to softball. The plot is awesome, I love the competitive and intense strategy that is portrayed in the show, and above all, to say that the cast for this show is awesome would be an understatement. I just stayed up all night watching the second season in Jap. subs, and the whole time I was saying to myself, ""I so want to hear this with that awesome English cast!"" Especially considering the dramatic character development that goes on in the second season. Funimation: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE dub the second season!!!"
5,A good deal for a more than good series!!,I was very happy with the complete collection of this surprisingly interesting anime series. I was satisfied with the price and the prompt delivery. I definitely recommend becoming addicted to this story and its characters.
5,Great math connection!,"This book is a great introduction to a study about time. I read this book to my first grade class and it really made them think about the problem that was presented in this book. After a few minutes, most students were able to arrive at why the main character was having difficulty telling time. I would recommend this very funny story to any 1st or 2nd grade student."
4,from vinyl ?,"Does anyone who has heard this CD know if the first album has been transferred from vinyl or a tape source? The Japanese CD of the self-titled album issued in the 90's was transferred from vinyl and the fidelity and pitch suffered. The American CD of ""About Us"" (also issued in the '90s) was from a tape source and sounded fine from what I recall. AU is the far superior album of the two here - a vastly underrated power pop gem well worth hearing again."
4,There is no way to escape your past,"This book is about a young woman named Lacey Elliot whose mother Amelia tells her nothing about her father or family any of the time while she is growing up. She is now twenty- nine years old and her mother just had surgery for cancer. They receive a letter in the mail that says it is very urgent that Amelia comes home and it is signed by her Aunt Vinnie. When Lacey reads this she is happy to discover she has other family members. Her mother is too weak to go home; which is Harpers Ferry, Virginia. So Lacey returns and gets to discover somethings she wanted to know and things she didn't. I really enjoyed this novel. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was. The author could have made it a little more challenging though by not making it so obvious. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little mystery."
5,Daughter of the Stars,"I have been searching for all the Phyllis A. Whitney books I can find. Amazon has helped me find over 20 of them and I am in seventh heaven. She writes a colorful and historic story of the area she is working in. Beautifully written, and she can tell a story like no one else. Happiness is a book by Phyllis A. Whitney - I haven't found one I did not like."
5,Good read.,"Action was good as always. Each book develops in its own way with the characters taking charge. The author shows very real life problems even SEALs must face and contend with. This book has what is, up to now, the darkest of the subplots and I believe handled in a way that was typical of the character. Still a very good book."
1,"Awful dialog, cookie cutter action","I picked up this book because I was looking for a decent military/special forces/action story. Well I definitely picked the wrong book because Counterfire was pretty bad and very unfulfilling. I wasn't looking for a deep storyline or highly detailed, complex characters, but this book gives new meaning to the term ""paper-thin"" when it comes to characterization. As for the action, it was only ok - very predictable - some Navy Seals take out a bunch of terrorists. I was hoping for some high-tech weapons/tactics thrown into the mix, instead the battles consisted of just boring shootouts. Also, the dialog and story telling was atrocious, the words didn't flow well and the story had no rhythm or tempo.I understand that many authors write under the name of Keith Douglas so I'm not giving up on the series, but I hope that this author calls it quits."
4,quick and fun vocabulary learning,"I picked this up a few years ago, but never really looked at until this past fall when I was studying for the ZMP (the Intermediate level test given at the Goethe Institut). The format is very easy to use, so easy that at the end of only about 5 hours use, I could recognize most of the words (not including those in the phrases section). The next day on the test, I noticed that there were 20-30 words on the test that I would not have known if it hadn't been for my ""cramming"" using the book the day before. Passing the ZMP (which I did) means that one has passed level 4 of a 5 level system. This book then, seems to me to be most suited for high intermediate and advanced students, although most intermediate students should also benefit from its use. Beginning students should start with a more basic book first (say ""Teach yourself German Vocabulary"" from the Teach Yourself series) before embarking on this one."
4,C-119 Driver,"A friend, who also flew the C-119 in 1953, recommended this book. The photographs and their reproduction were outstanding. A few quibbles - the captions on several charts were incorrect, and a paragraph was repeated.A major critique - there was far too much information about paint, insignia and markings, and not nearly enough about stuff important to pilots - clearer photos of the cockpit instrument panel, nav and com control panels, overhead switches, radio operator's station, etc. In addition, there were only a couple of pages relating to the comm and nav suite. I was hoping to see more details about the particular electronic aids to refresh my memory, the Tacan and UHF comm, for example."
5,A Quantam Leap fan,"Hey, I must say I am very disappointed to the slow release of Quantam Leap dvds. The last release was May 2005 for season 3. Now it has been almost a year before the 4th season is released! Hopefully, the next three seasons will be released sooner. Not almost a year later! Thanks for listening."
4,Very good series,"Start with Season One, because you'll want to catch the whole story arch, but you won't want to miss the wrap up in season 5."
3,Quantum Leap conventions,I have them all in case any one is interested. Please e-mail me. videoman3@cox.net Thanks.
5,The penultimate season at last!!!,"Episode Synopsis:The Leap BackPlay BallHurricaneJusticePermanent WaveRapedThe Wrong StuffDreamsA Single Drop of RainUnchainedThe Play's the ThingRunning For HonorTemptation EyesThe Last GunfighterA Song for the SoulGhost ShipRoberto!It's A Wonderful LeapMoments to LiveThe Curse of Ptah-HotepStand UpA Leap For LisaParticularly good episodes are :1. The Leap Back2. Raped3. It's a Wonderful Leap4. The Curse of Ptah-Hotep5. A Leap For LisaAll episodes are good, the 5 I have listed, are probably the best of the season.*** A lot of people have mentioned the music contained in the US version of these DVDs. They are right when they say the music in the UK version is unedited. I never noticed this until I bought the UK version of Season 2. The last episode - M.I.A. comes complete with the uncut ""Georgia On My Mind"". My point is, that if you can wait for the UK DVDs to be released, then do so - They are much more authentic and well worth the wait for die-hard fans."
3,Great Season,"I personally feel that Season 4 was one of the strongest seasons of the show. I am also hoping that they will leave the music intact for season 4 as in every episode is a period piece and the music reflects this.The music has been discussed over and over again at the the messageboard at www.quantumleap-alsplace.com and most fans of the show agree that replacing, especially Georgia on my Mind in season 2 was unforgivable.But as for the best episodes in season 4, The Leap Back, It's a Wonderful Leap, The Curse of Ptah-Hotep, and A Leap for Lisa. In addition, A Leap for Lisa is also one of the best episodes, period"
1,Music Cut,"I live in USA and I have been buying the Region 2 versions of Quantum Leap because the music HAS BEEN intact, but in Season 4 Region 2 it has been cut. I love Quantum Leap and having it on DVD but it is not the same without the correct music."
2,"I loved the show, but....",".... they took out the heart and soul of the show when they dubbed over the music that was in the episodes when they aired. MIA just isn't the same without ""Georgia on My Mind"" and I can't imagine that any of the 4th season episodes will be any better with their music removed as well. Canned music just doesn't work and I will not be buying the DVDs. Thank goodness I taped the shows when they aired. I will be transferring those to DVD and I'll at least be able to watch the shows the way the creative team meant for them to be watched and not this dreck that Universal is releasing now.I higly recommend the show but cannot recommend the DVDs."
5,How about 10 stars,"Only the Bear Family could produce something this epic. Folks, if you're a Ray Price fan, you'd best start saving your money and buy this box set. I will guarantee you will not be disappointed. There are 10 CDs here with over 250 songs from Ray Price and the Cherokee Cowboys. AND, this is the original Ray Price of true western honky-tonk, and those signature Fiddles....not the Ray Price of the early 70's and the background orchestra and violins of the Nashville Sound. I honestly cannot sing enough praises about this set, it really is that good. All I can tell you, is that if you don't own this set, you are missing one huge chunk of time from the golden years of Country Music."
5,An absolute must for every Ray Price fan!,"This is one of the most greatest sets I have ever owned. On the first three CD's you will hear the early side of Ray Price and many of the songs you will notice his Hank Williams influence. Many of you might not know that for a time Ray and Hank shared an apartment together and Hank was very instrumental in getting Ray's career started. The set ends with his classic, Danny Boy. His versions of songs such as Letters Have No Arms and also his classic album San Antonio Rose, A Tribute To The Great Bob Wills plus his Night Life album are all included her! Highly recommended!"
3,Disappointing as a Biography,"Puccini was reviewed as a wonderful account of Puccini's life and, while the author does tell us the events of his life, this account is less readable than most biographies I've read. She covers the facts of his life in a disjointed fashion. She will bring up a point and then say she will cover it in a later chapter, or she will say she covered it earlier. She arranges the chapters according to the operas he wrote, which is chronological, but the information she writes jumps around so much that it's distracting. The best biographies read as interestingly as the best fiction, and unfortunately this did not measure up. Puccini's life was certainly very interesting and this could have been a great book. Perhaps her editor should have done a better job."
4,Solid biography,"Not as good--or as long--as her Verdi, Phillips-Matz's new bio of Puccini is solid and competent. She is at her best with scenery, at her weakest with the music. Though this biography will not soon replace Mosco Carner, it's worth the purchase price and the reader's time."
3,Well researched but dry reading.,"Being a lover of Puccini's operas, I felt that Mary Jane Phillips-Matz's book might give a deeper appreciation of his life and the work that went into his compositions.While she has painstakingly done her research, including letters, interviews and reviews, the book remains just that - research. There is little cohesion to the material and she does not inject any interpretation or further character study of the man. Aside from a few peccadillos, Puccini comes off as a dry, unhappy person who happens to write beautiful operas.While the operas form the outline of the book, they are given rather short shrift; Puccini argues with his librettists, gets on Ricordi's nerves, finally writes the opera and it's staged successully. There is no description of the gestation of the works themselves - The various revisions of ""Madama Butterfly"" particularly suffers from this lack of explanation.A great disappointment from the author who gave us an authoritative book on Verdi."
2,weak,"This is a very weak work full of wrong translations, on ancient state of information. In the moment does not exist any english biography of Puccini, that would be worth reading. To learn the truth about Puccini you have to learn german and read the outstanding works of Schickling and Krausser. Of both do exist italian translations, but, in the usual arrogance, no english ones."
2,Disappointing,"This disc was a disappointment. I am a big fan of Christian Jacob, but this disc was awful. The playing was virtuoso, but Jacob seems to feel the need to fill every possible moment of every track with piano playing. As a result, it is very ""busy"" sounding and exhausting to listen to. This disc proves the well-worn adage that silent passages are essential to good music composition. Buy the Christian Jacob Trio: Live in Japan disc instead, which is excellent."
4,Great for compost too,"When you compost, the organic material will break down at different rates, so you end up with a pile that's mostly dirt but also contains things like wood that take longer to breakdown. This sieve is a great way to separate the dirt from the other things that are not-dirt-just-yet. I recently composted some leaves that had sat on my pea gravel driveway over the winter. Unfortunately, when I was raking up the leaves, I also raked up a lot of gravel. This sieve comes with three screens, so when I was shifting that compost pile, I choose a screen size that kept the gravel from falling through. Very handy indeed!If you have a lot of compost, this is not the quickest way to separate the dirty from the not-dirt-just-yet. The reason I gave this item 4 stars and not five is that the walls of the sieve aren't very high which limits the amount of material you can sort through at one time. All-in-all a great product that I would certainly recommend to others."
2,doesn't fit inside a 5 gallon bucket,"it doesn't fit inside a 5 gallon bucket. yes, it fits perfectly on top, but that means it slides off easily. it would be better if the top half had a diameter that prevents the entire sieve from going into the bucket and the bottom half had a diameter that fits inside a 5 gallon bucket."
2,waste of money,Did not do what it was intended for at all. it didnt sift out any of the seeds or sticks. i was really disappointed in it.
3,NOT A KITCHEN TOOL!!!,"Pay attention, this is a gardening tool, not a kitchen tool. Didn't I feel silly when my wife said she wanted a sieve and I bought her this! Fortunately, her father is into bonsai and might appreciate it."
5,A person just like you or me,"Marle Woodson's book reminds the reader that we are all human beings, with the same hopes and dreams, whether we are on the ""inside"" or the ""outside"" of the hospital walls. His story describe his stay in an Oklahoma hospital as a last resort to defeat his alcoholism. The book is not a sensationalist tale, but rather a telling record of his days spent on Ward 8. What I found compelling was his honesty as he contemplates his existence in the past, the present, and the future. His words are touching and sometimes humorous. I wish I could have met Mr. Woodson. This is a book for readers who are interested in how other people think."
2,Cheap coat,"Huge disappointment. It is not all down, it is down and feather mix. Very thinly filled too, definitely not warm enough in the Midwest.There is no zipper on the front, you close it with a couple of very tiny snaps and some awkward little metal hooks. It is a real pain in the neck to find the hooks in the fur trim. Even when you manage to close the coat, there are gaps on the front for the cold to enter.The fur is very thin and bad quality, I doubt that it would last through one season.I ordered it with free shipping, and when I initiated the return process, I was informed that 2-way shipping cost would be deducted from my refund. What a rip-off! My first and last clothing purchase on Amazon."
2,Size is wrong,"It was way too small. I returned it. However, The quality and service is good. Only if they have the size I need."
2,Super cute . . . but useless,"I love the look of these shoes, and thought they were perfect for my little guy for Easter. I even got him a bigger size than he really needs, so that they would last all summer. But I can NOT for the life of me get them on him. In order to get his foot into them, even they are wide and technically too big, his foot would have to curve very oddly. The way the tongue attaches to the shoe prevents the foot from gliding in at a reasonable angle.I am bitterly disappointed. It is so hard to find classic leather dress shoes for little boys. But they are useless to us if we can't get them on his feet. I'll have to return them."
4,Good fit,"I like the Sloggi panties because they seem to fit better - they cling better, they stretch better and the material is very durable.I use them for that time of the month when I need something tight to hold the s*n*t*ry pads in place : )"
3,It's just okay,"Several of the clips in this dvd are funny, but some aren't at all. What really bugged me about this dvd is that they wasted about 10 minutes on the McMahon-Donald Trump feud, which ended in Vince getting his head shaved. I didn't really find that segment funny at all. Same goes for the lame Hornswoggle clips. The Bushwhackers, Rock, and DX clips were good. All in all, it's okay, but unless you're a BIG wrestling fan, I'd suggest renting it over buying it."
1,You've got to be kidding...,"Why WWE releases trash like this is beyond me... couldn't they have put out a ""Best of Georgia"" or ""Best of Mid Atlantic"" instead? McMahon owns thousands and thousands of hours of classic wrestling and this is the best he (or his paid flak) could come up with? Groan... How 'bout a look at Harley Race? Or Jack Brisco? Or the Funks? ANYTHING but silly garbage like this!!!"
1,Really?,"I typed it before and I'll type it again,They sure got the name right. It makes fools out of wrestlers we like and look up to. It's dvds like this that give wrestlers and wrestling promotions a bad name. If you want to see wrestlers and/or wrestling promotions at thier worse? Go watch either a WCW tape from 1999 and/or 2000 or The Pro wrestling Gone Wrong dvd. Same diffrence. I give this dvd a 0 out of 10."
1,Very Bad!,"Do not believe the first reviewer who gave this video 5 stars. It is probably written by Curt Mitchel himself, or by the publisher. Curt Mitchel is the worst ""instructor"" in the world. Basically, he is an incoherent ""guitar dude"" (quite pathetic, really, a la ""Wayne's World"") who makes videos in someone's basement using an amateur camcorder. Very unprofessional, absolutely useless. Stay away from it, or - for that matter - from any product that is released by the same company. Deserves a zero rating, really."
2,Falls short of expectations,"This video covers major hits of the Eagles but not all the riffs! e.g. Joe Walsh solo (2nd guitar solo) on Hotel California. Overall though, a decent attempt and good intro to the music of the Eagles."
1,Not what I expected,"This 60 minute tape has the major riffs of the Eagles, but no complete song. Plus, the instructor talks alot about how he built his own guitar and voice box."
1,Be Aware! No Customer Service,"The iAudio 2 GB was an excellent product while it worked. However, after about three months, sound would short out. At first I could get it to work again by simply twisting the ear-phone plug but within a week, the sound would not work at all. Even though this item is offered with a 1 year warrenty, there seems to be no way to contact the company for warrenty, or any other service. No phone number or address is given, emails were not answered at first and later emails were returned as undeliverable."
4,cowon u3,Great flash drive mp3 player. The amp is strong enough to drive my full size headphones (beyerdynamic dt770) and sound quality is excellent.
1,"Great, but with no support!!!","I am sending my U3 back. It's cool, but they have no support at all. There is no number to call, just posted information. That is unforgivable!!!Only buy this if you are confident you will never need hardware or software support, ever!"
4,"Good, but exploits conservative fears of Dinkins era NY","Olden wrote a very interesting ""steampunk"" type novel in the early '80s, Poe Must Die. He's well-read and slips a lot of literary references into the racist, sexist internal monologues of his tough police detective antihero, Fear Meagher. I found myself wishing I'd kept a notebook of all the great wisecracks and one-liners in this quintessential New York story. Even though Meagher is a bigot with a heart of gold, I kept wondering if anyone but old white guys would find his jokes all that funny. I did, but I wasn't particularly proud of it. Also, the novel is already slightly dated, since it plays on middle class white fears of a black, liberal administration ""losing control of the city,"" a situation that has changed completely with the Meagher-like Rudolph Giuliani in office."
4,Fun and Fast,"This is one mean cop, the author takes the somewhat tired standby and doubles the nastiness and hatred to get a character that seams new. I thought the character was a personal embodiment of the bad parts of NYC from the 80's - at least for us who did not live there, our nightly news painted picture. This book is a fun, gritty book that has a very fast pace - - similar to watching a Die Hard movie, it is going to give you fast paced action and a satisfying ending. The characters are a bit one sided but it works in the book. This is not a character study with rich insights to the people, but an action thriller and gets up and moves."
5,Perfect,The platform fit my Velbon tripod perfectly and I'm now back using it for my family videos. Be sure to select the right tripod to ensure the right platform.
5,Worked fine,"Way back I didn't have delivery problems on these. In any case, as a tripod quick release plate, they work great -- the newer ones have a metal screw (some of the older ones had crappy plastic) and this makes all the difference. This product works fine (make sure that it fits your tripod ...)."
3,How do you rate an over priced piece of plastic?,"My work-place camera was stolen with the tri-pod shoe attached. The tri-pod shoe is the item I am rating.With out the ""shoe"" the tri-pod is useless for connecting the camera to the tri-pod.It's like trying to place a value quality rating on an ice cube. Go figure!"
4,More punk than hardcore,"1992's Satiate was the debut album from Richmond, VA institution Avail. I've never really been a hardcore guy, but as soon as I heard Avail's Over the James I became an instant fan of this band. I love their melodic approach to hardcore and their similarity to bands like Bad Religion and Social Distortion. You don't hear a lot of that on Satiate though. Sure, it's a melodic album, but it seems (to me at least) to lean heavily towards the early `90s punk rock sound. Not pop-punk, but it definitely fit Lookout's reputation more than say Revelation Records. It's got a great energy though, and you can pick up hints of what was to come on later albums.I still don't think Satiate is anywhere near as good as the Avail albums that came after it, but it's still a very solid first effort, and one I continue to dust off from time to time (I'm spinning it right now). If nothing else, it's cool to revisit the band's early sound and see how far they came in the ten years that followed."
5,insperational punkrock,"avail has been around for years in the punk community. there positive lyric base makes them a very insperational band, that just makes you want to get up and tear down the walls of racism, sexism, and ""macho-ism"" with they're many ""sing-a-long"" parts, you cant help but join in the chorus. a very good buy if you are into ""punk"""
2,Not so funny,"While the fear of flying may be an unrational fear, it is a VALID fear. The authors comedic stories about freak airplane accidents made me feel more nervous about flying! If it can happen to them.... it can happen to me!! I have had success in the past with a fear of flying book, but it was so long ago I don't recall the title. Since the birth of my daughter I found the fear coming back. Unfortunatly this was not the book to help me feel secure 30,000 feet up."
5,Excellent and very funny!,"This book was excellent and very instrumental in overcoming my fear of flying. It's use of humor throughout the book made it fun to read. It was very informative and gave detailed descriptions of all phases of the flight process. The author's recommended process for preparing yourself mentally before, during, and after a flight was very good. I kept this book opened during my entire first flight, and it helped not only get me through it, but made it an enjoyable experience."
4,Halloween has arrived.,The wallflower is funny and the entire series has a Halloween feel to it. The story is about a girl who looks like hell and 4 very attractive guys need to make her into a lady. The show is fun and I felt like I was in Halloween mode while watching it. The series starts off strong at first but drags a little bit around the middle and gets better towards the end. I recommend purchasing this series if you want to laugh out loud and love Halloween.
1,Not ouran just terrible,"Terrible what was the point of this show I guess it was just yelling the whole time. Nothing happens the whole 20 plus episodes. Just boring, terrible, loud."
2,creepy and lots of screaming,"There's a lot of good anime and this isn't it. The main character screams, yells, and cries all the time because the boys are too good looking. The boys yell at her; they yell because of her. The drawing isn't good. The main character spends most of the anime as a short simple no-detail cartoon. She constantly gets the anime nose bleed and it's not funny. The story is okay and there is some humor. It was painful to watch with all the screaming."
2,Hmmm...,"Basically, Pokemon silliness filled with sexual innuendo to the point of being obnoxious. It gave me a good laugh at points. If I had seen it first I wouldn't have bought it. It could have been worse (but it was pretty bad). The basic story line was good."
2,Too much yelling,"I thought this would be an adorable story like Ouran High School Host Club but all they do is yell at each other and my ears couldn't take it anymore, it was REALLY annoying..."
1,Haven't got it yet.,"This is another product I'd like to review for you, but yet again I haven't received it. It looks like it'd be interesting to watch, though."
4,Pretty Boys vs. Horror Recluse Girl,"This series was a lot funnier than I had originally given it credit for. Both the pretty boy and the horror girl points of view were played well against each other. This isn't really a fan-service or harem type of show because each character has a different love interest. Still, there are very funny, LOL spots in the story. Plot: The boys are living in a mansion owned by an eccentric woman and they are financially cut-off from their parents. The deal is this, they have to turn her reclusive, horror-otaku niece into a ""proper"" lady within a certain amount of time, or the amount they have to pay for rent will triple, including back rent!"
5,the wallflower: the complete collection S.A.V.E.,I was trememdously happy about my purchase. I cannot emphazise how pleased I was when I recieved my item. The item was nicely packaged. It arrived on time and was very well presented.
2,Floormats don't stay put,"These floormats are very pretty but the ""nibbed"" backing is definitely NOT non-skid. The floor of my car is already carpeted, and these floormats slide around like crazy, needing to be readjusted almost every time I get in the car."
3,"captivating topic, flawed execution","Kaplan and Marshall make a decent go of telling the fascinating story of Aum Shinrikyo, but a tabloid journalist's sensationalism and lousy editing cause this book to fall short of the mark. Still looking for a book on Aum which resists the temptation to replace engaging reportage with cheap thrills. All in all it's worth reading as a light introduction to Aum, as long as you don't mind a few one sentence paragraphs and head scratchers like ""brains trust."""
3,Badly in need of an update.,"Generally the book serves its purpose, as an overview of the Ruger pistol, it works, but it has a few problems.Chapter one, history: This section has a few small but highly noticeable errors such as conflating Springfield Armory, Inc., the company and the Springfield Armory, the government installation.Chapter two, variations: fine so far as I can tell, but of course the book was published in 1988, so quite a bit has happened since then!Chapter three, maintenance: Fine so far as it goes, but doesn't have anything on the Mark three which has several complications added to takedown.Chapter four, accessories: By nature this section was outdated as soon as it was published, but now it's almost embarrassing; some of the equipment in this section might be found in a museum.Chapter five, ammunition: Nothing wrong here.If you own a Mark two, this book still has value, especially considering it's price, but if you own a mark three your money might be better spent elsewhere."
5,Ruger Mark Standard model,"I believe this product is accurate pertaining to the pistol models. Indexed well.A good history of the company, and of the creators. Excellent data referencespertaining to each model; and diagrams associated to the models. A good read andwell worth the purchase price."
4,Ruger .22,"Informative, well organized and entertaining.Specifically, I enjoyed the development history and the the design tradoffs that resulted in the present design. The brief history of the background and evolution of Ruger factory was also of interest."
5,GREAT!,"I loved this video! It was very easy to walk with. The time goes by very fast. If you just want to do an easy exersise, this is the one to do! Leslie is very ease to watch! She talks through the video, but it is not constant. I find this video very enjoyable. I even look forward to it after a long days work. How many people can say that! By the time the exersise is over, I can feel how it has worked on my muscles."
4,Great rock reading,"Option had an interesting history. Originally called OP, the magazine attempted to cover everyting, letter by letter, getting partly through the alphabet before giving up and re-inventing itself as an indie label: SubPop. At that point Becker took over and continued it as probably the most balanced indie rock magazine of its era."
2,Total disappointment,"On page two mirrors have two types, the two options you have to buy, you have to select one driver or passenger, and send you the opposite of what you select, I expected a mirror and I get the other and all for no pay attention to clear previous comment where I said another dissatisfied customer ...... greetings from Costa Rica"
5,"Top notch, great looking leather briefcase on a budget.","The product arrived on time and in good condition. It is a nice soft leather briefcase with good quality zippers, wheels, handles, shoulder strap and extension handle. A great buy for the money. Includes sleeve for laptop (would fit 15"" fine but not my 17""; not important to me) and a little bag for laptop sundries like power cord. Lots of pockets and dividers makes this bag a perfect mobile office. I use it everyday and it takes it. Highly recommended."
5,Leather Briefcase,Amazon as always did a great job getting the item to me. I had seen it in a local store for over $200+ on sale. When I looked it up online it was only $111. It is absolutely beautiful and the leather is a great quality. I needed a briefcase on wheels and it fit the bill. I would highly recommend this product and Amazon for free shipping!!
2,Tips over when full,"I read all the reviews and decided because of the superior look and feel of the leather I would buy it. I travel a lot and if you only use a laptop and a few files, it is fine. If you load it up, it will tip over every time and this will get old real quick."
4,interesting,"Very interesting book if you enjoyed Confederacy of Dunces. I especially enjoyed the connection to New Orleans and surrounding area, as in Toole's own book."
2,Ken & Thelma or Joel & Thelma?,"In all fairness Joel Flether states that Ken & Thelma is not a biography but rather a memoir. And that is exactly what it is. If you want to examine the life of John Kennedy Toole, this isn't the book for you. It primarily concerns the relationship that the author had with Thelma Toole and her quest, all be it purely self motivated, to have her son's masterpiece published. The undercurrent seems to be a character analyis of Thelma, her ingrained narcissim and her outrageous treatment of other people. In the end it is about Thelma which would probably please her to no end. The author accomplishes his stated goal, but left me wanting more."
3,Second album not quite as good as the first.,"""Love and Affliction"" is the follow-up to last year's phenomenal self-titled debut for Consonant -- Clint Conley (Mission of Burma), Chris Brokaw (Come, Codeine), Matt Kadane (The New Year, Bedhead), and Winston Braman (Fuzzy). Although this album feels like a more well-rounded group effort than the first one, ""Love and Affliction"" just doesn't have the energy that ""Consonant"" had, and the band never seems just to rock out. The album is still good, though -- tracks like ""Mysteries of the Holiday Camp"" and ""Are You Done?"" are stellar and capture the band's energy and enthusiasm.Overall recommendation: If you liked ""Consonant"", you'll definitely enjoy parts of this album. If you're just starting to find out about the band, then their self-titled debut is probably a better place to start out."
3,"Interesting, but monotonous","They use interesting chord changes, but the instrumentation is similar on every song, which leads to a monotonous effect. They sound like the typical college band -- earnest but not fully formed."
3,Why bother?,"Pounding, shrill, and markedly lacking in subtlety or grace, this tinny guitar band seems to be shooting for a Superchunk-ish abandon, but don't quite pull it off. (And this is the best a bunch of vets from Mission of Burma, Codiene, Bedhead and numerous other indie bands can come up with?) Sorry, guys! Nothing here to hold my attention..."
2,Leaking LG refri,I too had a small pin hole leak in the tubing on the rear of the frig. Now I can' t connect the tubing after replacing it. It will cost me a bundle to fix.
1,FATT MATT'S CDR~~~CDR WARNING!!,This is FATT MATT who was tossed from the band for being the fat slob he is still being a lazy fat pig living off 20 year old memories pedaling $1.50 CDR JUNK for $14. But the other 2 on 1 by Old Metal Records! Fat Pig Rip-Off Matt gets penny ZERO and you get a better quality REAL CD! Stop these jerks from pedaling garbage on 50 cent CDR's by NOT BUYING THEM!
2,"Nice photos, weak content","The photos in this book are very nice. However, there's not much to learn from the content. This isn't a ""coffee-table"" book. It's more of an ""end-table"" book. A much better book for a little more money is called, I think, ""The Sax and Brass Book."" It has even better photos, and it also has a big section at the end with the serial numbers through the years of many sax companies and lots of information about what years were weak, when companies sold or moved or burned down, etc."
2,Just lost me as a reader,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the ""SCE"" series, and have read them in order. Characters and relationships are what makes Star Trek books great. While the stories in this book were well-written, and I have enjoyed these authors in past books, I found this book much less enjoyable due to the widespread death and destruction. The ending of ""Wildfire"" ensured that the next book will be even less enjoyable. I read Star Trek books for pure escapism. I don't want to be weighed down with grief. I read to be entertained. And they killed off the most entertaining character, for pete's sake! I don't plan on suffering throught the emotional fallout the next book promises."
4,"Very powerful, very gripping story.","This story does just about the best job I've seen of any Star Trek book of conveying the emotions a crew will feel during a disastrous mission when many of their crewmates die. I dock it one star because the threat itself seemed rather contrived and had a definite feel of ""seen that before, been there, done that""; both the alien energy intelligences living in the gas giant atmosphere and the protomatter terraforming device have been done before, and I have my doubts that Starfleet would ever consider using such a thing. But the character interactions were perfect, and the heroism displayed by the whole crew, including minor characters, was a delight to see; this is what I read Star Trek for: the idea that human beings (and other sentient life forms) are capable of great heroism is somewhat passe in most other forms of literature these days, and I enjoy seeing characters responding to crises with competence and true heroism now and again."
4,Very good production,"I saw this performance at the MET and it was my first ""Grimes"" but probably not my last. I had owned a copy of the Jon Vickers CD for many years before really taking the time to listen to it. The CD recording grabbed me with the first interlude (which is very haunting and makes a perfect ending to the opera). I liked the MET's ""advent calender"" wall set, a little claustrophobic at times but certainly a different way to go. Anthony Dean Griffey, Patricia Racette and the supporting cast are excellent."
1,Poorly edited and technically subpar,"Please, please do not waste your money on this book. The book has errors every other page, the lack of overviews and general depth do not leave you in a position to truly implement these product lines, and I was forced on a number of occasions (see Chapter 9 for an example; configuring the 3000 concentrator) to question the editors' understanding of the technology. I purchase technical books monthly, and have bought Cisco Press on a number of occasions, including the MCNS coursebooks. This was the first time ever that I felt so disappointed that I felt compelled to write the Publisher, and certainly comment publically. Please consider other alternatives."
3,Just ok,"I found this book to be useful for simply learning the commands to troubleshoot and setup a VPN on a PIX firewall. It was basr bones and dry (as are most vender sanctioned books are). It was lacking in detailed and real world examples. It tells you the commands for troubleshooting ipsec or isakmp, but does not really give you a lot of good information on deciphering the output of these commands.If you simply need to know the commands and how-to of setting up a VPN, then this should work ok.Note: My review was based of of the PIX sections of the book only."
4,Very nice comforter set,I like the comforter set a lot and it description is perfect. I have also washed it using cold water and dried in the dryer. That worked fine as well. The only thing I would have changed is the thickness of the comforter. There is no added insulation in the comforter itself. But other then that I love it. I bought some 350 count black sheets and it looks awesome.
3,"Good, but flawed.","I want to give the verticle roaster more stars, because it's good, but it has one flaw the maker should fix. The roaster comes in two pieces, the base - great for roasting veggies - and a cone that the chichen sits on. The problem is that the cone is too big. I tried it with a rather largish chicken and the cone made the chichen stand up so high, it touched the lid of my barbeque grill. I'll try it with a smaller chichen, although the chichen may not fit on the cone. It was hard enough getting the larger chichen to fit.It would be better if the cone was either shorter or narrower or both. I think it should also have holes in the cone, so the steam from the beer or other liquid used would enter through the sides of the cone as well as the top."
3,3.5 stars,Solid work from the great trombonist. Album focuses in puertorican folklore with jazz which was a different approach from other artist.
3,slow in the beginning...,"I felt the movie was just alright. It felt very slow to me. It took a while before anything remotely interesting happened. I was almost ready to give up on it. A young girl falls for an old married author. The author feeds her lines that he loves her and will leave his wife and things of this nature. The girl then starts hanging out with a young wealthy heir. She is eventually torn between the two men although it is most evident which one she prefers. I really enjoyed the ending. It didn't have a sterotypical ending. Actually, the ending is why I gave it 3 stars. I don't want to ruin it by giving it away and the ending isn't life changing or anything of that nature...I just liked it because it wasn't the typical happy ending riding off into the sunset on a white horse along the beach sort of thing."
2,A Bunch of Losers,"Okay, to enjoy a film, I personally need a character to at least feel some empathy with. The three main characters in this movie are all vacuous fools. A young woman (very sexy) falls for a married author. So she's a ditz and a tramp, and the old guy is a pig and a perv. And she sees and uses this young guy, played extremely ineffectively, when things fall through with the old fart. A spoiled useless rich punk prone to jealousy and fits of stupidity. All in all, just a waste. No suspense at ALL, just mindless conversation by self-centered idiots. And it's advertised as being sexy and adult. Not True! No sex worthy of mention and no nudity. Boring. Dull. I watched it a few days ago and have no lingering memory at all. Maybe a few, and I want them to go away soon."
4,"Doesn't fit 2 16 gauge, let alone 2 14 gauge - Cool for smaller wires","Great concept, just too small to fit the wire sizes specified. buy the yellow ones 12-10 AWG (Yellow) for 16 or 14 ga applications. I use mostly yellow in my work where I thought I would use blue."
4,Hardy Plants,"Hello - I received my plants in excellent condition. I am currently waiting for the weather to be stable before planting in our garden.Thank you for providing such a great variety of items that can not be found locally, at reasonable prices.Tina - MI"
5,Excellent workout video to give to a friend who is just embarking on the Leslie Sansone journey,"I sent this video to a good friend as a beginning way to work into the Walk at Home video workouts. It gives 3 options in one DVD. The one mile, the two mile and combining them to make a 3 mile. It was wonderful to give something to someone I love for their health. I have gotten so much out of my experience with Leslie Sansone and the Walk at Home videos. They have finally helped me to stay consistent in my walking no matter what the weather is!!! I have gotten such great health results and at 48 years old feel like I am in better physical shape then some 20-30 year olds.God bless you Leslie and all of your walkers ~ I love you!!!"
5,Leslie Sansone Walk away the pounds,"I think this video is great, it starts out very easy for those of us who are completely out of shape. It builds up gradually which I really liked."
5,"Best because 1&2 Miles & fast and easy to do, time saving and it works!","I am very picky about walking DVD's and I spent over an hour just picking this one out. I like the fact that it gives you a quick One Mile and then a Brisk 2 Mile, and on the menu you can choose the walk you want. And like most people, I do not have that much time to work out walking. So I found that this DVD in the ONE MILE takes only 15 minutes! This is a wonderful and easy to do walking DVD. The only thing is that the stretch ribbon is not included, it needs to be ordered separately. I have done both walks and most of the time, I just have time for the quick one mile walk. This is my second favorite walking DVD. My favorite is the Denise Austin 1 Mile walk DVD as it is fast to do and also easy. However, I alternate the two DVDS for variety. This is a good buy and worth the price, one of the best walking DVD's out there!"
4,Leslie Sansone DVD gives good workout.,"This DVD has one good workout and one so-so workout. I found the 1 mile walk to be too tame, especially compared to a Sansone tape I've had for years (1 mile super calorie burn). This might be ok for someone who is just starting an exercise program, but for anyone else it's best to skip it and go directly to the 2 mile walk.I found the 2 mile walk to give a great workout. It's strenuous enough to make you feel you've really exercised, but not so strenuous you're a limp rag afterwards. My only gripes with the tape are the long lead-ins (I fast forward) and Sansone's tendency to silliness. Still, worth the $."
1,not good,I order a leslie sansone Walk away the pounds at Christmas time.I was very unhappy with it.after the 1 mile walk it went black.so I put it inmy computer and did not work.my order#is 105-44296786525829.Thank you Dolores
5,Great for beginners.,"I really love this video. It gets me motivated and is very easy to follow along. Because i am extremely overweight and out of shape i have to break during the routine for a few seconds. But then i get back up and continue the routine. I like the way Leslie encourages me with such words as; ""you can do it"" and ""feel the stress releasing"". I highly recommend this video for those who want to get into shape but cannot handle a grueling workout. Walking is the best exercise for physical and mental well being. If you are interested in getting into shape and haven't exercise for some time this video is a great way to get started."
5,GREAT PRICE,"I LOVE ANYTHING THIS WOMAN DOES, SHE ADDRESSES ISSUES FOR ALL EXERCISE TYPES AND IT ADDRESSES ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT LOSS NEEDS. THE PRICING FROM THE SELLER WAS AWSOME-I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN. CAME WITHIN A TIMELY MANNER EXACTLY AS INDICATED."
2,too easy...,"I will start by saying that I am a regular exerciser and feel that I am in pretty good shape. I love to walk, so I have several of Leslie's walk at home workouts for days when I can't walk outside. This workout uses a ""stretchie band"" but you only use it for a couple minutes at the end of the workout. I don't like this dvd because I feel like it is a waste of my time because it is so easy...I don't even work up a sweat. You will do the traditional moves from all of her other workouts, but you only use the upper body very minimally. This may work well for someone who is very overweight and out of shape, but I wouldn't recommend to anyone who is even marginally in shape."
1,Didn't fit my car...,I have a VW Jetta and I thought for sure these would fit my car but they didn't. Luckily I had a friend who has a van that they fit and he bought them off of me. I never found out how he liked them but I surely didn't.
2,"tv ok, vcr forget it",The tv picture is acceptable but the VCR ate three tapes and a tape cleaner in just two days!
2,They should stop making TV/VCR combos all together!,I use-to have a Emerson TV/VCR combo and it use-to ack so retorted. Let me explain the problems.1. Sometimes when you put the tape in it automatically cutes to TV off by itself.2. It won't let you stop and rewind or fast foward it so it can go faster.3. The tape gets stuck in it and won't let you eject.So I had enough I just threw the whole thing in the trash and bought a new RCA TV/DVD combo at Wal-Mart cause I never hear about those messing up like I hear about the VCRs from other people.
5,Great!,"Santa brought this for my 2 year old son for Christmas and it is the best toy. Why? Because you don't have to put it together, it is light weight, it is reasonably priced and my son can play with it for a long period of time and not get bored.It comes with 2 small cars and we found that any typical sized Hot Wheels or Matchbox car fits on the track.I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun gift."
4,Good for the price,"This is a fun toy - and good for the price. My 3 year old son loved it and played with it all day when it arrived. However, the construction of the tracks could have been a little more sturdy. Like many other reviewers complained, NO other similarly sized car can race on these tracks (and we have a LOT of tiny cars) - while this is not a limitation, it would have been great if the kids could have a variety of vehicles racing on these tracks."
1,Don't buy this toy!,The cars that came with this toy can't make one revolution down the ramp before they stop. This toy is very poorly designed. We tried different brands of cars but none would to down. Don't waste your money on this. Mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the market.
4,still going,"My son recieved the older version of this game 7 years ago for his second birthday. It was one toy he kept playing with over and over again. To mix it up a little he'd race his other Hotwheels with his brother. Some cars didn't work very well, some went faster than the original cars which added to the fun. I am buying it for a little boy hoping he'll enjoy it as much as my two boys have."
2,Not worth the $20,"Says that its compatible with Hot Wheels, but they don't work very well with it. The Hot Wheels either fall off the track right away or go like 3 inches and stop. The cars that come with it work fine, but kids like variety and get bored from using the same 2 cars over and over. And if your kid loses a car, they don't sell replacements as far as I know. Hopefully they do eventually."
2,Ack! No replacement cars!,"We got this for my son's first birthday because he loves to drop things and roll cars. It was great until my nephew came over this weekend. Gulp! I keep hoping he hid them here and didn't take them home in his pockets where they would be lost forever. I can't find the cars and apparently there are NO REPLACEMENT PARTS. Hot Wheels don't roll past the first curve... so at the moment we have a toy that doesn't function since there are no cars that work on it.I would give it 4 stars if we could still play with it.Update 11/7/2011Keep trying other die cast cars. We did find some Matchbox and Hot Wheels that worked even better than the original cars. We found the original cars so the need to order anything disappeared.I finally gave the set away now that my son is 3. He still liked it when he ""found"" it in the closet, but has so many other tracks that something had to go."
3,racetrack is fun but...,"My 2 year old son loves this racetrack but it doesn't not fit the regular matchbox cars as advertised. The sounds the track makes each time a car goes down do get a bit annoying after awhile too. Overall, though, my son does enjoy playing with this toy."
3,Good overall,"My kids (age 5, 3, 2) all love this although it keeps the attention of my youngest for the longest. The two cars it comes with are little, plastic, and lightweight. They fly down the track. Of our 20 or so metal diecast cars, we have ONE that is small and light enough to be equally as fast (I think it has a plastic body). Some of the others fit down the track but are slow because of their weight; still others are too long to make it down the tight spiral and get stuck. In theory it shouldn't matter if the track works with any other cars - except that we all know the two it comes with will someday be lost! It would just take a little hunting at Walmart or Target to find a small, lightweight replacement."
2,Other Cars DO NOT Work!!,"I bought this after reading other reviews saying other hotwheels, matchbox cars, and diecast Pixar Character cars would work... they don't! The tracks are not wide enough to accommodate other cars (we tried about 30 different ones!), they get stuck halfway down. The cars that come with the set are much smaller than most die cast cars. A little frustrating considering the price. I would return it for a refund but my son loves it, he doesn't seem to mind only being able to use the cars it came with."
3,"Simple, but fun","This toy does one thing and one thing only....luckily most boys find that one thing pretty cool! Just know that the ramp does not accommodate the die-cast cars--only these tiny plastic ones that come with it. My other realization was that there is no on/off switch to the sound effects which are triggered very easily, so I hope you like the phrases ""Speed, I am speed!"" and ""You're one gutsy racer!"" That being said, my 3 year old son has played with it quite a bit, and probably likes it more than me! I think there are better toys out there though."
4,Not compatible with die-cast Disney Cars!,"I purchased this item for my son with use of his die-cast Disney Cars. However, most of the die-cast ones were too big to make the turns on this track. So, even though it is listed to be compatible with die-cast cars, that doesn't necessarily mean the ones from Disney/Pixar! We ended up getting some of the ""Mini-Adventures"" plastic ones for my son to use on this track as well. That all being said, he loves racing on this track. It is just frustrating that it can not be used as we initially planned and were lead to believe."
2,"Looks Fun, But is NO Fun!!!","We had been eyeing this toy for quite some time because it looked like so much fun. When my son finally received it for his 3rd birthday, we were very disappointed! The 2 cars it came with were very cheap and not heavy enough to make it all the way down the track. They always stopped about half way down. We tried some of our heavier matchbox cars on it and they did a little better, but they still go very slow and are lucky if they make it all the way down without stopping around the curves because the design of this isn't very good and the cars always get stuck there. One side will never let the car go all the way, so it's kind of pointless because you can't race the cars. I would find a different design. This one was disappointing!"
5,Works with most Hot Wheels,My son is 21 months and loves cars. This toy is perfect. It is pretty durable for a car track and works with most Hot Wheels. Provides hours of fun.
3,Flames on Speed,"When an old video fireplace DVD wore out, I bought this one but didn't like it as much as the old one. The flames on this one flicker at such a rapid rate that it is not relaxing to watch. If I could slow down the play rate of my DVD player, it might look normal, but as it is, it feels like it is on fast-forward."
3,Good introduction to pharmaceutical process engineering.,"An above average treatment, although a bit too brief in many areas, especially the various unit operations. One must have some basic understanding of chemical engineering concepts to follow through the pages, although the initial few chapters tried to address that. However, there are still plenty of useful insights with regards to pharmaceutical process engineering. Could do with more figures of actual equipment used in the pharmaceutical industry."
2,Wrong Color,"Arrived in a timely manner but were not the same colors that were pictured online. I specifically ordered the item because I wanted bright yellow and orange balls and neither are in my package. Instead, I got pastel yellow, pastel pink, and white."
1,No story resolution,"This story was about as deep as one of those bars of hotel soaps on the cover. I didn't give a cr*p about any of the characters or their neurosis'. The ending provided no resolution to the 1 of the 2 main storylines. The author also wasted to many pages talking from the perspective of an in-utero & newborn. Reading this, I thought I was projecting myself into one of those ""Look Who's Talking"" movies. Waste of time."
2,2 1/2 stars -- quick and cute,"This was a quick read and kind of cute. But this book is not going to go down in history as one of the greatest novels of all time - or of 2005. The story of the OCD former beauty queen and the often shallow pregnant teen is handled well enough. I would recommend this book for readers who want a quick escape. However, like the characters in the book who are overly concerned with their visual appearance; I've come away feeling that this novel itself is too shallow but attempting to have depth.Regardless, this could definitely be movie material - as another reviewer suggested, a Lifetime movie or even a good, independent film. But a great book does not always make a great movie; and a great movie is not always based on good books. This book is simply not great."
3,A book with lots of potential,"This book was a page turner and really entertaining. I found myself getting wrapped up in what it must be like to ""wash"" (obsessively clean). I only give this book three stars, however, because it falls way short and just ends. I felt like the author played a big joke on me by just ending the book when I felt like it literally was only halfway through. There was no real conclusion to the story. What happens to each of the characters? I believe the author really didn't know how to end her story so she just ended it way too soon."
3,Started Out Great...,"But by the time I finished, I felt like the writer had ran out of things to say several chapters back and the overall book could have been much, much better. It is the author's account of where he was at spiritually when he wrote this book and the highlights of getting there.As someone not coming to Buddhism from a Christian perspective, I felt like much of Pym's writing was aimed at someone else. The chapter on Christianity and Buddhism was a real disappointment in that it failed to address any of the more serious conflicts in worldview that the two religions might have but seems to latch onto what, in my estimation, appears to be superficial similarities.Dogen mentions those who try and force Buddhism into being what they expect it to be as those who not yet given up the attachment of mind. While not a bad book, per se, I certainly would certainly suggest keeping this in mind while reading Pym's work."
1,Not a lot of value to this DVD,"I really enjoy Chris Duarte's playing but I feel this video is little to no value to any player. If you are a new player, he doesn't really teach you anything. He tells you a few times that you need to get into the material and figure it out yourself. If you are an experienced player, he is not going to tell you anything you haven't heard before. I've purchased two of these newer Hal Leonard videos (also have the Eric Johnson video) and I don't really think either of them are done very well. The Hot Licks videos are older but much more useful, if you actually want to learn something."
4,I can't play a bloody lick,I only wish I could play guitar .So this video wouldn't teach me anything . I will say I've seen Chris play live at least 4 times . He absolutely floors me . He can entertain for a two or 2 and a half hour stretch and amaze my face off .I would love to get this .
3,Charger is for old Nicad Only Battery Not NiMH,"I did some searching and found this to have the old Nicad Battery and Nicad only charger. The Charger DC9700 wont charge the newer Nickel Metal Hydride batterys which are way better than Nicad.Longer lasting , No memory, Stronger More MaHoursThe NiMH will work in the drill but you need a charger."
2,Disappointed,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is uneven, devoting too much time to the early years and only two short chapters to Washington's presidency. It so desparately needs editing that I'm suprised it got published. For example, on page 304 the story is told of rioting New Yorkers tearing down George III's statue; the story is repeated in full again on page 307!!I do know more about Washington than I did before I read the book. At times the writing is quite good, but it looks to me like the author got bored with the project and finished it off in a hurry."
3,A Great Life - An Average Book,"Willard Sterne Randall's George Washington: A Life is a decent book overall. I would agree with others in that the book covers some areas in great detail while leaving others only lightly covered. There was also several areas that seemed to be covered twice.While this is a good single source on George Washington's life, there must be other resources that provide a better, detailed description.Please don't misunderstand what I'm saying, this is a good book. However, it just seems that this book could have covered some of the areas better."
3,Too many gaps to make this a great book,"Sterne Randall has written a decent, but somehow very incomplete biography of George Washington. He does a good job on the early years and the book is readable, but it later falls apart. While certain revolutionary battles are well covered, many such as Yorktown are barely mentioned. In addition, the all important winter at Valley Forge does not get much attention.The book barely covers Washington's presidency, covering it in 70 of 500 pages written. For such a monumental event, this is little time. In addition, there are factual errors, for example Hamilton is described as the son of a British Admiral. A few pages the correct parentage is given. THis book is a good first read, but a better editor should have been assigned."
2,"A somewhat interesting, yet flawed biography.","Although providing some interesting insight into Washington's domestic life; his relationships with his mother, his wife, step-children, and step grandchildren, Randall's book lacks precision and accuracy. The many factual errors in dates and events are enough to make this book a chore to read for any who may be a serious student of Washington. The author uses and reuses the same quotes, often withing 1 or 2 pages in the text. Additionally, Randall is lacking in military knowledge, as he has made several errors regarding military terms or equipment and its usage. Oh, and yes, we all know that Henry Knox was fat, but we don't need to be reminded of it every time he is mentioned."
2,George Washington,"A poorly written book with careless errors. The map on page 24 shows Fort Loudon to be in Pennsylvania, some 100 miles north of Winchester, its true location. The map also shows the James River extending fron the Potomac River east of Fort Cumberland through the Allegheny Mountain all the way to the Chesapeake Bay. It offers some interesting tales, but what can one believe!"
1,Nice guitar. Can't tune it.,"I bought this based the other reviewer's great remarks.But, as the title says, it's a ""Toy Guitar"".It looks good, but can't tune. It's so difficult to tune. You tune one string and do the next. When you go back to check, the tunes are gone -- they don't hold. I even tightened the screws on the back of the keys, per the instructions.For $14.95, at least it looks good. Maybe Ruby Tuesday's can use it as part of their wall deco."
3,Not one of Korman's best,"Gordon Korman has delivered to us an astounding amount of unforgettable books which I will reread forever, I Want to Go Home!, Who is Bugs Potter?, and the Bruno and Boots series really do stick in your mind after you read them, they are classics. However, No Coins, Please, falls of short of the line I've expected him to meet. First of all, the counsellors are unbearable dull. Even though we spend much more time with them than with the counsellors in ""I Want to Go Home!"" they are much more boring and predictable than even the minor counsellors in ""I Want to Go Home!"". Similarly, the other children just aren't as interesting or noteworthy. The humour isn't really there, and as for the schemes, well, the extra prank Korman put on his website as a joke is more noteworthy.So what's my point? If you want to read a great Korman book, get a MacDonald Hall book, I Want to Go Home, or Who is Bugs Potter?, and leave this one until you don't have any left."
1,from the back of the information sheet,"Really, an article? I was expecting somthing helpful on rar conversions. What a scam. I could have torn that off the back of a software box. Its not even informational to guidance or how to work the product. What a rip off on what you call an article. Never again Amazon on article or written product downloads. You need to look into this one."
3,"Good, but","Overall these appear reasonably nice for the price. The brown is a bit darker and more uniform in color than depicted. As others have brought up, my biggest complaint is the slippery soles, nice for ice skating on some surfaces (e.g., wooden floors)."
5,The best shoes,"I first bought this shoe because it was on sale, wow loved it so much so that, ever since all my shoes are Clarks. Best in comfort."
3,mens brown shoes,"These shoes are very nice, the color and comfort. Except there was a scuff on the left shoe upper right side. I was disappointed by that."
4,Comfortable,"But... They scuff up floors pretty good. Sometimes I wonder if they are really Clarks for the amount of money that I paid for them and the fact that they are a marking sole, but oh well, they fit and they are comfortable. For the price I highly recomend these shoes, but take them off before you go into the kitchen or your wife will have your ____ in a vice!"
2,So-so entry into the Great Brain series...,"I would only give this 2.5 stars out of 5. As someone who grew up with the Great Brain series in the '70s I was quite pleased to hear about this ""lost"" book surfacing a few years ago. These were my favorite books when I was a kid and I kept them for many years afterwards. Imagine my disappointment when I read the introduction by the ""editor."" If one were to believe what she writes here, she is the one who should be commended for the ""Great Brain"" series, not Fitzgerald.Oh, please.Her insulting forward aside, readers should know that this book was assembled (after his death) from Fitzgerald's notes and we will never know for sure if he intended for it to be published or not. It's a fair book, but it doesn't have nearly the spark of the original works, all of which I would highly recommend over this, any day of the week."
3,"Fun, but not as good as the previous ones","I've read all the great brain, and this is my least favorite. It is written by someone else after the author died, and it's obvious. It is entertaining, but does not qualify as a great brain book to me."
3,great show,My sisters and I watched this show as kids so it was a great pleasure to watch this show again as adults with kids of our own and share it with them!
5,Excellent show,"I absolutely loved this show as a child, but when I ask others about the show no one remembers.I am so glad to know that there are other fans of this show out there, and that episodes can still be purchased."
2,not what I expected,"First of all, this is labeled Vol. 1 which would lead you to believe it's like the first season right? Well, it's only two episodes!!! Way overpriced for 2 measley shows on VHS. Also I did love this show when I was a kid but I have to admit...seeing it now, it's pretty corny and cheap. We must not have had many options back then!!"
1,Not what I thought,"I've had three coasters out of the first five disks. I thought I was buying first quality TDK disks - turns out these have a media code of ""CMC MAG D01"" which indicates they are made by CMC Magnetics, a consensus second tier manufacturer. Shame on TDK for rebranding these and trying to pass them off as first quality."
2,Good for ladies with smaller feet,"Due to the way these boots are cut, they would look better on smaller feet. I wear a 10 and I felt like I was wearing clodhoppers. Also, the shaft of these boots are on the small side (which adds to the appearance of larger feet), unless you have thin calves tucking in jeans would be difficult or uncomfortable. They look well made though."
5,WOW!,"THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED! This product has cleared my skin & has made it amazing! I have a beautiful glow that now, I use less makeup! YAY!"
5,Philosophy When Hope Is Not Enough,"This is not the first, nor likely the last time, that I have purchased this product. It does what it says it will (at least with my skin) and also helps to keep my skin moisturized throughout the day. Days that I have skipped this and still used moisturizer, I notice that I have to moisturize and additional time. I use the serum with my regular skin care regimen, which includes products from other lines."
5,Great product,I love this facial firming serum. I use it every morning and every night after I cleanse my face. There is nothing like it. Thanks.
2,Was hoping for results,"I used this product as directed for about 10 weeks and I never saw any noticeable difference at all. I'm in my mid 30s and while I don't feel my skin needs a lot of firming, I have to say that I expected to see some type of result. Nope. My bottle came in a gift pack with several other Philosophy items, so I did not seek it out specifically.I have noticed lately that I am developing a spot of hyperpigmentation on my left cheek. I can't say that this product played a role in that, but the timing is suspicious."
5,Great skin care product,"I have been using this for 6 months and the bottle will last me at least for 3 months, so this is my second bottle. Even at 55 yrs old I have 28 yr olds compliment me on my skin and ask what product I use. Use just 6 drops each day in the morning and that is all you need. There is no stickiness and when you put the moisturizer on you will not know this product is there. Very light weight and will not change the consistency or color of your foundation either."
4,I like,"I like this, the smell is a little medicinal. Not sure if it is firming anything, but it is light on the skin, not greasy at all. . It seems to help ,e from breaking out."
3,It's OK,"I bought this product because I absoloutely love the hope in a jar face cream for dry skin. I gave this item 3 stars because, maybe, I haven't used it for long enough, (a few weeks) but all I can rate it is that it is OK, but nothing special. I wanted to buy Estee Lauder night repair to try, but as it is so expensive decided to give this serum a try instead. I have now bought Estee Lauder aswell but haven't tried it yet. In other words, I am disappointed with this product."
3,Reasonable Price for an OK Product,"So many firming products are quite expensive--well over $$$--so when I saw this item and the favorable reviews I went ahead and bought it. I must say I am not impressed. I don't know if it's a case of you get what you pay for or if my expectations are unreasonable. It did improve the texture of my skin over all, but did not make a significant change on my severe dark circles and my jaw line is still soft. I have a wrinkled ""wattle"" at the back of my chin it did not help and although my ""jowls"" are not too bad--they are still quite soft and obvious. I have used this product for at least 8 months--bought it in the Makeup Optional Kit--and when it is empty I will go on to another product. It just seems for tightening products the ingredients that are truly effective are more costly."
4,Good Movie.,"I love the first part of these movies, however a lot of people seem to complain it's not true to D&D where as the second one is more so. But when i watch this movie I forget all the D&D and just enjoy the movie. Their probably right it's not true to D&D, but I don't really care it's a good low budget movie regardless."
3,Not So Good Blu-Ray Release,"The Blu-Ray release wasn't even necessary, it looks washed out and grainy and you can even see some of the static from the picture. However, I do like the movies themselves. I saw the first one in theaters and I didn't go in with any expectations. Granted the movies could have been better but I enjoyed them for the most part.Do I recommend the Blu-Ray release? I'm 50/50 on it but if you can find it cheap I say go for it.Overall Rating: 3/5"
2,Extremely shallow coverage,I expected a little more from this book than creating a simple java file and compiling it. This book is for someone who is new to IDEs. This is *NOT* for someone trying for a quick reference to migrate from another IDE to Eclipse - which was my purpose.
3,Wealthy woman dies at Mall,"In the wealthy, fictional town of Hancock, Connecticut, Amanda Worth stands out as a snob who has the best of everything and refuses to shop in any but the most exclusive stores. Imagine Susan Henshaw's surprise when she finds Amanda in the dressing room of the new outlet mall--------dead! Susan and her friend Kathleen begin investigating the murder and discover hints of financial ruin and hidden love affairs in the Worth's past. Add an eccentric psychic to the mix, and things become very complicated. This book has its moments, but the conclusion is still weak (as happens in several books in this series) and the supposed motives seem pretty far-fetched. This is a quick and sometimes amusing read, but the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
4,Not my favorite Leslie tape,"While I love Leslie's walking tapes, this is not my favorite. Her fat burning 3 Mile with the 2-lb. weights is a much better workout IMO. Also, her 4 Mile Super Challenge is a great workout. This one was a disappointment."
5,Fat burning.,"I bought the 1, 2, and 3 mile express videos in one big pack, and I started with the 1 mile and worked my way up. The 3 mile is my favorite though, because it's just challenging enough to really get me going, but it's not too hard. It's helped me lose over 40 lbs now. By the end of the workout, my legs start feeling like jelly and almost like they can't do anymore, and that's right when we get to the cool down, so it's perfect. I love these workouts so much that I am going to order the 4 mile one soon!"
4,Next step in WATP express series,"I have used WATP express 1 & 2 mileLeslie Sansone: Walk Away the Pounds Express - 1 Mile Easy Walk/Brisk Walk, 2 Milesfor a year to supplement an aerobics class and was more than ready to move up to 3 miles. Leslie's nonstop chatter can be annoying, but the moves are easy to learn. She has you use a stretchy band during the third mile. This title wasn't as hard on my knees asWalk Away The POunds EXPRESS with Leslie Sansone Set 4 #1 Easy Wlak #2 Brisk Walk #3 Advanced Walk #4 Walk Strongthat I did with friends where she has you do some ""boosted"" walking - aka mild jogging, but no stretchy band or weights."
2,She talks INCESSANTLY,"I threw my stretchie at the TV last night.Leslie just chats it up too darn much in this series! I was sick of the moves....way to many reps because she spends the time TALKING. I realized this when I finally muted it. I LOVE most of the other WATP series, but not this one! It's the second or 3rd time I've tried and definitely the last!"
4,Good DVD from Leslie!,"I really like this DVD from Leslie, although I enjoy working out to her 2 Mile Brisk Walk and the 4 Mile Super Challenge just a little bit more. I like to mix up her 2-3-4 mile walks, depending on the time I have and how I feel that day. I work out with Leslie just about daily - her workouts have helped me lose 45 pounds! I'm so thankful I found her years ago and then bought some more of her DVDs the past five months. Thanks, Leslie!"
4,Walk Away the Pounds 3miles,...great step up from 2miles...if you like Leslie you will like this 3mile
5,Nice Bright Light Bulb,"Clean, clear white light bulb.Good life.Worked out well in my outdoor porch light."
1,Cute but cheaply made,"I bought this for my eight year old daughter and when we got it home noticed it was very cheaply made. The petticoat underneath the dress is a separate piece, and it's made out of construction paper (no joke) with the orange tulle attached. The petticoat wouldnt fit under the dress either. The dress was cute, but the hat and petticoat were pretty shabbily made. We returned this item to the store the very next day, disappointed."
2,Not as shown in picture,"This Scosche dash replacement is not like the picture that is shown above. First of all it doesn't come with the trim ring and that trim ring is no longer produced. So good luck trying to find that. Secondly, the upper gap of the dash replacement is too big and will bring your stereo down about 2 inches on your dash. I'm not sure how much I like that as the other dash replacements were better placed. What the scosche dash replacement has going for it is that the texture is better and looks more professional than the ones say Crutchfield sell. Not to say those are horrible, but the structure of those dash replacements can fold since the plastic is not terribly sturdy. I'm not too happy with this, but it took me so long to put it in my car that I'm just going to leave it. I own a Honda Civic Hybrid 05."
1,Wow,"I just finished putting 4 coats of paint on my center console thinking I'd be able to slide this dash kit in. To say the least, I'll be spending tomorrow's afternoon sanding the console down and paying double for a dash kit at a local audio shop. 2002 EP3."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","I was excited to purchase jay jay's adventures because it focuses on learning science rather than the standard math and writing of many of the other leap pad cartridges. However, while my 3 1/2y daughter seems to want to really enjoy this especially because there are dinosaurs, it is usually the last cartridge she chooses. Perhaps this book is alittle above where my daughter is developmentally, as it requires a bit more cognitive understanding and skills rather than the motor skills of some of the other cartridges."
1,Cheap products,"I received the watch within a couple of days of ordering. I've owned a watch very similar to this one before so ordered this one to replace the other when it gave out after a few years. I was disappointed to find this a much cheaper version of my original watch. Being blind, I am very dependent on watches like this during my day-to-day living. The ""voice"" of the watch is hard to understand and the buttons on the watch are hard on the fingers to push. Finally, the biggest disappointment ... the watch stopped working within two weeks! I've ordered other products from this company before only to be disappointed by the cheap craftsmanship of the product."
3,A pretty good clock for a watch,"The voice is clear.It appears to be very accurate.The band broke on one side before I could even get it out of the box. Our local jeweler suggested we mail it back to the seller for repair, but it seemed like an excessive investment of time/money for a $15.00 watch.We use it as a clock in the extra bathroom."
2,Should give you time when the button is pressed longer than 2.5 weeks,I gave this watch to my husband for Christmas. It stopped announcing the time when pressed after less than 3 weeks of use. There was no aper in the packaging box for any kind of warranty.lila is the seller so I would give them a 1 star. They were late with delivery and have no return policy. Thank goodness the watches time display is so big you can read it without glasses.
4,Good watch,"I've owned a similar watch. The 4-alarms are very helpful for me since I have tasks that need to be done at certain times. Hopefully this watch band won't crack apart like the prior watch band. Unfortunately, it looks like this band can't be replaced on this watch... at least I've never seen the area the band is connect to the watch be so narrow."
3,not another atomic dog sample,"george clinton and the p funk all stars have plenty of other songs to sample besides ad it's bad this is weak and not worth the money and it would be a joy if daz and other rappers would sample other songs by the funk mob like get your funk on, and dog star."
2,"Dry, completely dry.","While this is a wonder of words, a piece completely in poetry form, this is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. Unless you are a lit major or have a lot of free time on your hands and can sit through pointless speeches consisting of endless pointless description, buy anything else."
3,An Oily Mess,"I've been buying these for a couple years now.Starting 6-9 months ago, the bars are often dripping in oil. Not moist, dripping. They use to always be the same slightly moist texture. Lately, I've even received boxes that were oil stained.I've called a couple times to complain, but they never call back.I still occasionally buy these, though only when I'm going to be home or office so I have multiple paper towels to soak up the oil.A couple years ago, I would have given them 5 stars. Not anymore."
2,never again!,"i found this bar online and the ingredients looked really good. but luckily before buying a box of 12 I decided to try one from my local wholefoods. i agree with the previous reviewer describing it as ""an oily mess"" - it was literally dripping with oil - really disgusting! maybe at one time they were better i wish i had tried it then. but i don't think i'll ever give this bar another chance. The 2 stars i gave - is for the nutritional value.... The taste, texture, smell - eewwww...!!!!"
3,It's OK,"Book seems smaller in volume and content, even though in good shape. I was looking for the full exposure of this program, but that is not to fault the seller"
4,"Well-written, interesting backstories to important medical discoveries","Overall I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to those interested in medicine and science. I most enjoyed the recent discoveries (later chapters), and therefore found the first few chapters a bit more tedious to get through (just personal preference). Excellent storytelling overall."
1,"Glorified dongle, only less convenient","Package contains only the ""cradle"" and a USB cable identical to the original cable included with the player. The ""docking cradle"" I received was simply a larger version of the dongle that comes packaged with the Zen Vision M.Based on the product description, I expected an A/C adapter to be provided with the cradle, making the purchase worthwhile. In fact, we ordered *two* of these docking stations based on this expectation. Since, in essence, we spent $80 to get two packages of redundant plastic, we are returning them for a refund.Also, please be advised that it is necessary to remove any case or skin from your Zen Vision before it will fit into the the cradle."
4,Does the job,"I went on vacation and left the supplied docking cable at home so needed a backup to keep my player charged and to transfer more music & videos.Firstly, Amazon delivered it very speedily, and secondly it is much tidier than the dock that comes with the player. The player fits snugly into it so there are no issues of the player becoming partially disconnected as can happen with the supplied dock.Not a vital piece if kit, but it is an improvement on the supplied dock."
2,Expensive,"great concept, but its very expensive for only a dock. It doesn't come with a charger, only a chord to plug into your computer. For the price it should come with a charger that plugs into the wall so it can be separate from your computer with out using up your battery."
3,pleased with modified product for car dock,Assembly was perfect for what i used it for. It was mounted it inside my car with the audio out jack feeding into my stereo through the ventilation.
4,Creative Zen Docking Station - Works great,"The docking station works great, better than always trying to find the little white adapter needed otherwise. I thought since there is a lot of new Creative players coming out, I should get the accessories for mine before they are not available anymore. Product as expected and delivered as expected! thanks"
3,station dock,"Not the best purchase I have ever made, it is more a nice thing to have than a necessity. Works well though."
4,Handy Accessory,"I use my docking station for charging and transfering and it works well for both purposes. I like not having to fumble with a power cord, all you need is one hand to set it on the dock. I do not have any trouble with the device being unstable. While it is something one could live with out, I am glad I have it. It would be nice if it could be plugged into a wall outlet as well."
1,Does not come with power adapter! You must buy seperately!,"Just so you do not make the same mistake I did, you must buy the power adapter seperately with this in order for it to charge while transering files or listening to music. I did not see this anywhere on the item description, but maybe I am just missing it. I am returning product. I just do not want anyone else to make the same mistake I did. Hope this helps :-)"
2,"Nice, but...","If you're one of the responsible mp3 owners who actually use a protective sleeve for your little investment, this docking station is a royal pain in the hiney!! The player WILL NOT fit in the dock with the sleeve on so you have to unfasten the velcro then TRY to pry it out of the jacket enough to get the bottom to sit in the dock. And the little adapter thingee that comes with the mp3 player is a LOT more convenient to use and you accomplish the same thing WITHOUT spending $40!!"
2,NOT NEEDED,SAVE YOUR MONEY...YOUR CREATIVE ZEN VISION COMES WITH WHAT IT NEEDS AND THIS PRODUCT IS NOT NEEDED. TRUST ME!
3,"Base ONLY, NO AC charger","Its an expensive base for the Zen Vision M... and has exactly the same use (3 ports) as the synch adapter that comes with the Zen... but you can sit the player upright on it. You CAN also sit the Zen upright with a skin on it by taking the top piece off the base.This base DOES NOT include an A/C adapter, that's another option you buy separately. I found a car and A/C adapter set, which plugs into the end of the USB cable that came with the Zen, which were fairly priced."
2,As stable as a two-legged tripod,"I have to give this at least two stars because it does indeed have A/V and power ports and will hold your player upright (as long as you don't try to touch it).However, the cradle is NOT weighted, and the base is far too small to provide even minimal support for the high center of gravity of the docked player. Consequently, if you try to press any button on the player while it's docked, it will tip over. If you never adjust the volume of the player, need to pause it or skip a track, it's a passable item. If you interact with the player in any way, this poorly designed cradle is NOT for you. To add insult to injury: the price! Holy Moley! It would be overpriced at Five Dollars, but at almost Forty...it's insulting! The most amazing this is that it's NOT some third-party knock-off, but it's from Creative!Abysmal design, unstable, obscenely priced....avoid this like the plague."
1,Just give me some juice,"1. Why doesn't the Zen come with a means of charging through a wall outlet? Why can it only be charged through a computer?2. Why doesn't the dock come with a power adapter so it can be charged through a wall outlet?3. Why does the adapter cost $30???I've found myself without access to a computer whereby I can charge my very expensive, all-wonderful Zen. Words fail me to explain the extent of this frustration since it could all be relieved by Creative supplying the little square thing with a cord."
1,Poor software,This is a very poor video poker game. Betting amounts are dismally small to start with and you can't save anything. Since I paid very little I can't complain.
1,Green Picture,"I got this at Best Buy 4 months ago, its been serviced twice, has a replacement board and there is a 2 month + wait for 2 more replacement boards (digital and scaler). The picture is lime green, especially on the left side. The Tech keeps saying all of them (this model) have a green picture so repairs won't work ... so here I sit waiting for repair #3 - by the way, don't get it at Best Buy or use their warranty - its a big battle getting them to replace it or even fix it. FYI This Model wasn't made by Sharp, it was made by a far inferior manufacturer, and the picture shows it. Anyway, it would be a great set if it wasn't like looking thru Lime Green Jello. Perhaps the other Aquos models live up to their rep."
1,not happy,"The picture quality is very good.The delay in changing channels is not a big deal, usually you will have a satellite or cable box hooked up anyway to avoid the problem.I've had this TV for 9 months now and generally very happy until 2 weeks ago. For some reason the picture just cuts out after 10-20 minutes leaving only sound. If you wait the picture can come back on by turning TV off and waiting, but then it goes off again in a few minutes. Not happy with the service, still waiting for a call back.I REALLY WISH I HAD SEEN THESE REVIEWS BEFOREHAND."
1,Died an early death.,"We bought this TV after reading glowing reviews only to find out that the picture quality is poor when viewed from slight angles. Also, after 13 months of use ours has now died. Sound works but picture is gone. Cycling power on/off might bring back a partial picture for a few minutes but then it is gone again. Another expensive lesson."
1,Died after 11mo,"This TV worked great for 10 months. The picture appeared better than similarly priced TVs at the time. Sharp, bright, color seemed good, tuner seemed to work well with an amplified table-top antenna. The menu system was probably the biggest weakness. Also, it used the 5.001, 5.002 format, which is a pain when you want the digital version of channel 5.But then, after 10 months, the picture randomly started going dark. Channel changing worked, audio worked. Now, after 11months, all that happens is the ""Please wait"" screen appeared - then darkness. Now, fortunately under warranty, we are trying to get it repaired. But this is totally unacceptable quality for a name-brand product with significant cost. Two weeks now no TV (not that that is the worst thing in the world) - does the warranty provide for a loaner?"
5,"Awesome TV--for 10 months, then the picture starts dropping out","I bought it when it first came out (yikes $1700 after taxes).After learning the in's and out's, it was a great TV. Using the integrated tuner I can get a few HDTV channels (local only) for free! So I can watch NFL games on FOX in HD [woot!].Some complaints are that there is a little delay when changing channels, and the remote is long and clumsy, but those are minor complaints.The big problem is that after 10 months the picture started dropping out, leaving only the sound. I took it to a Sharp Authorized Repair Center, and after a little work they worked with Sharp to replace it with a brand new one (not a refurb).The new TV works great, but I would get a different TV if I had it to do over again.Drew"
3,Channel changing delay,"I brought this baby home, had it set up in only a few minutes. The one thing that drove me crazy and prompted me to return it ... there is a delay whenever you turn it on (it says 'please wait' on the screen), and then there is a delay everytime you change channels. For the die-hard channel surfers out there, it's a deal-breaker. I should note, however, there is no delay if you are changing channels through your set-top box (I had it set up both with and without it).When I returned it to the store, they said it was standard with Sharps (I don't know if it's all of them ... my 2 year-old 20"" Aquos has performed admirably with no delay)."
1,Do not buy this TV!!!,"After 14 months I began having the exact same problem as many other owners: After initial startup with the ""Please Wait"" message displayed the screen goes blank and only audio comes through. This happens about every third time we try to use the set. SHARP customer service pretends they don't know about this problem even though I suggested they google their own product or even look at the Amazon reviews. My set was at a repair shop for over a month and they decided they couldn't fix it."
2,Good picture but poor reliability,"While this set produces a good picture the video has failed in a similar manner to other Amazon reviews. If you must have this set an extended service warranty is highly recommended. (This is a Best Buy purchase.) Our set first started losing video at 11 months. We had a service call and the TV went another month or two before acting up again. If it were not for the extended warranty we would have been out of luck at this point. To cut to the chase, after three service calls and three visits the set was pronounced unrepairable and we're being allowed to get a replacement TV of any brand from Best Buy."
4,Don't believe all the negatives,"I've had this TV for nearly a year and haven't had any problems with it. The picture is great, and makes my PS3 look fabulous. Be aware that some of the negatives are isolated problems, and some are even about shipping, which have nothing to do with the product.Now, I do have some minor squabbles about this TV:1) The remote sucks. Its hard to get used to and is laid out very strange.2) The channel delay when flipping through is horrible. I now have a DVR that my cable runs through so it isn't a problem anymore.Just do your research before purchasing a TV like this. As for my opinion, this is a good TV for the price."
2,Avoid the Gimick and Stick with Philips Vision Plus,"Save your dollars and see more with Philips Vision Plus bulbs. I actually bought these and then returned them after further research shows that you actually can see more with just the plain Philips Vision Plus bulbs. I used the Blue bulbs for 10 years and was always wondering why my headlamps were so dim, especially driving at night through the Colorado mountains.Then I tried the plain Philips Vision Plus and now the mountain roads light up a night! Plus, the blue bulbs do not work as well in the rain."
1,Hella 100W Xenon Blue bulbs,"It is difficult to tell much if any difference from original, stock bulbs. These are defiantly not blue as their name implys. They seem to be same color as originals. I should have replaced with regular bulbs and saved myself $50.BB"
4,the most accessible text on the subject,"I disagree with the previous reviewer. This is the most accessible text I know on symplectic geometry, and the one I would recommend to a beginning graduate student trying to learn the topic on their own. It is certainly easier (and lighter) than McDuff and Salamon's book (Introduction to Symplectic Topology), which is much more comprehensive but requires more effort."
3,comforting,This is a comforting book for someone who has lost a beloved pet. The author believes wholeheartedly that pets also have souls and that often they are able to return and comfort us after they die. This book was given to me after the death of an animal and I purchased this copy for my sister when she experienced a loss.
1,I believe BUT...,"I am a believer in the afterlife. I wanted to read about cases that could prove it. The author mentions very few cases. Most of what she mentions is her life with her rats and how cute they are, and ends by trying to convince you (in a loooong chapter) to become a vegetarian.This is definitely a book that I do not recommend to anybody. There are better books out there if you want to deal with grief from an animal loss. If what you want is proof that we will meet with our pets in the afterlife, you won't find it here."
2,Not Very Moving,"I purhcased the book and hoped to find some consolation after the loss of my pet. Some of the stories seemed very plausible, others were not convincing. One thing it did illustrate was the bond between humans and their pets, but I already knew that before purchasing.If you want to hear a lot of stories about people and their pets, this would be a good book. But insofar as trying to achieve solace from the stories, or even be convinced of an afterlife, I'm not sure this would be the book for you."
3,Alittle hard to swallow,"But the author does seem to understand what animals are saying. I felt the book was worth reading because of her love for rats. They are very, very intelligent creatures. I do believe they can communicate with you. I think the author should get a macaw or a quaker conure. She'd be amazed."
5,Animals and the Afterlife,"Well written and kept my attention. This book might not change your mind if you are a skeptic, but certainly gives you food or thought."
5,This Book Speaks The Truth,"Animals, like the human animal, are living, breathing, feeling, loving, soul-filled children of God.We are all in this together.We all get tired, we all get wet in the rain.We all experience loneliness, we all experience pain.We all thirst for water, and we all thirst for love.We are all Children of God, Who's Angels watch over us from high up above.We all breathe, we all play, we all feel.We all get hungry and we all appreciate a satisfying meal.We are all born, and we all deserve to live life.Nobody should be left behind, or be subjected to a dissecter's deadly knife.We all die, and we are all born into everlasting love and life in Heaven.... in paradise.Where, as one spiritual family, we all share love, and we all get treated nice.In Heaven, we all gather together, one species, one race, one religion, and all of us have lots of fun.In Heaven, we all realize, that we all are really ONE.We are all one.One life.One Soul.One Spiritual Family."
3,Animals and the Afterlife,"Wow, I learned quite a bit about animals and their purpose in the wheel of life. There are many heartwarming examples of all types of animals and their devotion to their owners, and the author did a wonderful job with her research and documentation of the stories of these wonderful animals. Interesting book, but a little slow moving and repetitive."
1,Won't Power Up!,"Bought this DVD player only because a more expensive model was not in-stock. Took it home, hooked it up and it worked fine the first couple times I used it. Then, I could not get it to power up. I've tried unplugging it multiple times and it still won't turn on. What a waste of money!"
4,Can't get to 1080p mode,"The player is very nice but I cannot get it to go into 1080p mode. I have it connected via HDMI and I turned on Progressive mode, but when I cycle through the display modes 1080i is the highest. It looks great, but I bought I want 1080p mode. I cannot find anything in the manual about this."
5,My Father's Favorite,"My Father always told me that this was the best JAZZ album that he had heard in his entire life. He once sent me on a quest to find it for him for his birthday, because he no longer had a copy of it. I only wish I would have found this album two years ago before his passing."
4,Nice job of breathing life into facts about the Kiowa people,"Having done a fair amount of research on the Kiowa culture of the mid to late nineteenth century, I found that Kosser did a nice job of breathing life into the facts regarding Kiowa life, environs and U.S. political and military climate. I recommend the book as casual reading for anyone interested in this period of history in the Southern Plains."
5,"Wonderful sound, incredible radio","Greetings,My old TEAC SL-D80R(ed) was damaged years ago in a thunderstorm power surge. The CD section no longer worked. Since then I have located and pounced on three replacement units.Why? The sound quality for the size of the radio simply cannot be matched by any other unit. The overall sound and bass is TEAC ""solid"". It just sounds as good as it looks. But why three? Well, if another storm takes out another unit, I still have backup. The thought of losing such a fine looking and remarkably sounding radio/CD player forever is just unthinkable!With two in black and one in red, I am still scouting for one in jade. What can I say? I am hooked."
3,fenton Book,I thought that there would be more updates on the Fenton Hobnail in this book and more pictures is why I bought this book.. I also purchased The Big Book of Fenton-- 1940-1970 which I feel is much better since the pictures are more clearer and the detail in the description. I have two great books but would recommended the second book more because of the detailed pictures...
3,Good learning tool,"I used this book as my primary study tool to learn SQL 7 Administration, but I needed other materials for practice test questions. The same publisher has another book, SQL Server 7 Pactice Questions, which tracks the chapters in this book exactly. If you get both you will do fine. Note: passed with 820."
1,Don't buy this book!,Filled with typos and based on Beta code.I borrowed the New Riders from a friend and passed.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.
1,"Who is the author of this book,the worst book I even seen!","This is really an aweful and very disappointing book.It is even does not meet the basic ETHNIC standard. I really mean that why there are so many mistakes, wrong concept, wrong explaination.The author is allowed to express the knowledge in his own way that may leads poor-writing, but you can not write in a WRONG way.This book will destroy the reputation of the publishers in this series.The worst book I even seen for SQL Books."
3,Just Slightly Above the Average,"This book lacks of in-depth tutorials and too much ""copy and paste"" sentences. However, this book is useful if you only need to concentrate to the test topics and objectives. Do not expect anything 'close to the exam questions'. Use Exam Cram for that. Find at Books On-Line for more detail knowledge."
1,DO NOT USE THIS BOOK TO TAKE THE 70-028 EXAM!,I failed my first test out of the six that I have taken thanks to this book.
3,Good review tool...regardless of the frustrated comments.,"I have read most of this series for MCSE, MCDBA and MCSD and this book is average. If you are comfortable with SQL Server administration then this book will help you review the A-Z's of the exam. Don't expect this to be your only source for SQL7 administration though. It has some errors in it, as do most of the others, so try to find them and make yourself feel better about your SQL7 Admin skills. As with any of these books, they are not designed to teach a novice everything they need to know to pass the exam. I have read some comments about how none of the questions were like the test. Come on, why don't you just send someone else in to take it for you! They are REVIEW and preparation guides. Try working with SQL7 for a while in a production environment before you think you can pass the exams, then this book will be helpful in reviewing the necessary information."
2,Not impressed,"Typos galore! The review questions are nowhere near the level of detail of those on the actual certification exam. Many screenshots in the book are based on the Beta version of SQL Server 7, and are different from the actual production release of the software."
1,Waste of time & Money,"Waste of time & Money. After using this guide, I failed my 1st out of 9 exams (all others successful on 1st try). The Books Online in far more useful and even easier to read. The practice questions had no resemblence to the actual test at all, and whole areas of importance were glossed over."
2,Not enough to pass the exam,"Although this book gives you enough background info to move onto something deeper, this book will not help you pass the exam. Any book that requires you to go out and buy another book to pass, is not worth the money. I read the whole thing, and didn't mind that it was based on the beta version. What I cared about was the false sense of security this book gave me about the amount of knowledge I had. Often I would have to sift through the pages of this book just to find the information burried within. If you want to know about sql7 get this book. If you want to pass the exam, don't do it."
2,A good intro but unlikely to help you pass the exam.,"I found the book to be generally well-written and think that it would make a good introduction to the concepts and procedures involved in getting started. Also, the screenshots in the book and menu descriptions seemed accurate to the final version of 7.0, so whether or not it based on a beta did not seem to matter much.However, the book bills itself as a study guide, and in this aspect I feel it falls far short. If the exam were a test of simple facts and commands the questions and review software would be adequate, but in reality they do very little to prepare you for the real test. The exam focuses very heavily on 'what if?' and 'how do you solve...' type questions.I say save your money until a real review book comes out for this test. The MOC and Books Online seem like the best sources for info so far."
3,Don't buy if your intention is to use it to pass the exam.,"The book has a lot of technical information in it where as the exam is based upon what if's and assumptions. The exam is not very well written which makes this book pretty much useless for a study guide. I wouldn't recommend taking a microsoft certified class either. If your looking for help on passing the exam I suggest you get the beta copy of SQL 7.0 and practice, practice, practice."
1,"it sucks, don't buy","since it was based on the Beta version, many of the screens didn't match the final version, how can you use it to prepare for the exam?"
1,Garbage. It's based on Beta Version. Forget it.,"I took the Beta Exams from Microsoft. Please spare me the 5 star reviews. This book is advertised as being capable of preparing you to pass the exam 70-028. I seriously doubt it as the book (text, figures, etc) are based on Beta 3 or earlier. Microsoft has yet to release the real exams and only finished the Beta Exams on SQL 7 so how could anyone in good faith and conscience publish a book saying they can prepare you for an exam?? Your money, you decide.Regards"
1,Book was full of old & incorrect info,"As a certified SQL 6.5 and 7.0 instructor, I had purchased this book for use in my classroom by students looking for additional help. I was extremely disappointed in this book as it has old and incorrect info. For example, this book had the number of data page types wrong and the new size of stored procedures wrong ... I would NOT recommend this book! It was an obvious (bad) patch job from their earlier 6.5 study guide. I, personally, returned this book within a couple of days of purchase."
2,VERY poor!,"I was extremeley disapointed with this book. It has a lot of mistakes and poorly written. Coriolis book by Talbert is much, much, better. That one actually helped me."
2,Waste of time,Terrible writing style and heaps of mistakes makes this a book that I wouldn't give to my worst enemy.The author contradicts himself several times and gives false information. Even some of the answers to the ridiculously easy questions don't agree with the theory in the chapter which is being tested on.Don't trust this book to get you through the exam.
3,A starting place,This is a place to start if you know nothing about SQL Server 7. But falls well short if you plan to take the exam. The sample exams are somewhat useful but are nothing like the real thing.
2,"not deep enough, and lots of typos, inaccuracies","I picked this book up since there's not much to choose from out there right now. Right off, lots of typo's. Answers to the chapter quizes are frequently incorrect. This book does not cover the Profiling and other tools like DTS in sufficient detail. However, the chapters on replication were ok. Luckily, I did manage to pass the exam the first time largely because I soaked the books online. The self-test software hits you with the same questions found in the book, so not much challenge there, except you're given 230 questions to answer each time! If the publisher makes errata/corrections available, and beefs up the test questions, I might give the book three stars next time."
1,My two cents...don't waste your time,I don't see how anyone can give this book a faverable recommendation. The book is full of errors and omissions. Just as an example the book list exam 70-028 and 029 as electives for the MCDBA cert. I recommend that anyone whishing to learn SQL Server 7 (either for life or for the exam) should read SAMS Teach Yourself SQL Server 7 in 21 Days.
5,It&#65533;s perfectly good for this exam,"I see a lot of complaints in regards to the use of beta in this book. I feel quite differently from some. The fact that this book was and is offered before others makes it extremely valuable to me. Plus, the book is certainly not ""junk"". Anyone who knows the product and is an intermediate or advanced user should realize that the use of beta does not devalue this at all. Incorrect and useless information devalues a book, and this one is not bad. Strong sections on replication, and replication scenarios. Would have liked a bit mpore on planning for nstallation, but even this is not a bad chapter. Found a few typos, but nothing overwhelming. This is a good value, and I don't think you'll be disappointed in it."
1,"Errors on self test, screen figures, and exercises","There are errors on self test. Figures shown in the book does not match with what you get on computer, steps shown in exercises are not correct, I believe this book was based on a SQL 7.0 release that does not match with the latest release."
2,"Decent text, very poor practice exam","If you're preparing for the certification exam, the chapter material is more helpful than not, but the practice exams are terrible. The exam engine design is poor, e.g. After completing an exam, you cannot review questions you answer correctly. The exam questions are much worse than poor -- it doesn't appear that anyone even proof-read the questions and answers, e.g. You read the answers, chose the correct answer, A. 10 kilobytes, but its counted wrong because the solution is recorded as B. 10 kilobytes. Out of 50 practice questions, I had 14 incorrectly counted as wrong, and I can only guess at how many were counted as correct, that were actually wrong, since you can't review what it counted as correct. The book would be a 3 or 4 star, but the exam is almost worse than no exam at all."
3,kitchen appliancea,"I bought this microwave because of price and it states on the description it has 1,100 watts of power but after getting it saids 700 watts. I do like the microwave I just wish it wasn't misleading in the description."
1,Save Your Money,"I saw Carol Alt on a morning show talking about all the great foods and the ease in preparation. I purchased this book with the expectation that she'd get more in depth. My honest reaction: This is not a book for the serious.I read the other reviews and actually based my purchase on those reviews. Wow, was I disappointed and I can only assume that they are her friends or publisher. ;)This book is a narrative and serves those who enjoy the gossip rags. 50% of the book references her hockey-boyfriend and social life between California and New York. WHO CARES?!?In the 1/8 of the book where recipes and food combinations do appear, they are nothing special. Basically any reference to food details, she routes you to Whole Foods or Quick Oat stores to ask their staff.I really felt that I wasted my money and probably could have spent it at Whole Foods -- speaking with a store clerk who would provide more substance."
2,Much better books on RAW available.,"Being a raw-foodist and chef, I did not find this book to be particularly interestig or the information valuable. I respect Mrs. Alt for exposing people to the raw lifestyle, however her book contributes little in terms of information regarding nutrition, transition advice, etc. The recipes were very generic as well.I would recommend reading the Boutenko Family's material as a much prefferable introduction to the Raw Lifestyle."
4,"Eating in the Raw: A Beginner's Guide to Getting Slimmer, Feeling Healthier, and Looking Younger the Raw-Food Way",Very interesting book. A good introduction to eating Raw with some recipes at the end. Doesn't get into a lot of specifics about how the enzymes and nutrients work in your body but is a good start to lead to further research on the subject.
3,Interesting RAW introduction...,"I bought this book and I think it is a good introduction to RAW, although there are different ""practices"" and not everyone agrees upon them, it still has good information. Anyways if you liked this book then you will LOVE: RAW IN TEN MINUTES which is 100% Vegan and RAW and fast, fun and easy to make with all the recipes being under 10 minutes to make and are ready to eat and serve, many are under 5 minutes or 2 minutes! http://www.Rawinten.com and it is listed on Amazon.com of course! Enjoy!Bryan Au"
1,Doesn't deliver,"This book certainly tries to bring it all together, but in the end lacks a coherent program to start a raw foods lifestyle. I am left having to search for another book to do the job. This book may have some interesting information, but look elsewhere if you want to transition to a raw foods lifestyle."
2,Not for the average raw food beginner.,"Not the best book about beginning raw food. This book probably is more for those who can actually afford going by her tips (shopping at Whole Foods, Wild Oats, buying hundreds of dollars of juicers and processors.) Not many recipes, and those that are included are recipes you could find on any raw food websites in addition to the little information about raw food you find in this book. I agree with the other reviewers, you learn more about what a crappy eater Carol Alt was pre-raw food and less about the actual raw food information you want to hear about. Definitely a book I would suggest NOT to buy, a waste of money."
1,Worked for me... I am a beginner.,"I read some of the reviews. Wowwww......some are really harsh and I think can be really misleading. They gave very little credit for what I found to be a realistic approach to what Carol Alt clearly states on the front of her book ""A beginner's Guide "" I did not find it to be a waist of money at all. I AM A BEGINNER. I appreciated the enthusiasm, passion and reality that this book conveys. It felt like she was a friend speaking face to face with me sharing a gift in a very genuine way. She breaks it down to a point where it's not overwhelming and states not to go crazy rather build on what you already do/know and build from there. She gives references on where to shop for raw food no mater where you are. Look, I'm a busy person. I want to save the planet, world peace and eat well but like with any thing new 1/2 the battle is showing up. It's got to be real or I won't do it. She does a great job at making it real... It works for me!"
3,Too complicated,"Miss Alt's book is a first attempt and does bring the benefits of eating raw food to the general public; however, I find the book a bit too complicated with the long recipes and the sprouting and dehydrating emphasis. Basic fruit and vegetable preparation need not be complicated."
4,Eating in the Raw,I liked this book because it gave a history. I can relate to personal stories and found her recovery very inspiring. I often give this book as a first for newbie friends to read because she dosen't take away everything from the beginner. I have found that most people will eventually give up the meat/fish and dairy on their own after a short while. For my husband an Ice Cream Addict this was a big help. Even he has dropped from eating ice cream every night to once every 5 or 6 weeks.
3,An Interesting Overview,"Carol shares her own experience with diet and her transition to eating raw food and this is interesting reading. However, there isn't much here in the way of practical advice on eating raw food so you'll need a better guide if you want to learn how to do it."
5,"Carol Alt, Eating in the Raw: a Beginner's Guide",After seeing Carol Alt interviewed on Fox News Channel about eating raw I wanted to learn more. This is a very well written and informative as well as entertaining book. Carol explains how she found her way to raw foods and the effect that it has had on her life. I have not taken the plunge into raw foods but this book definitely made it easy to understand how to do so and will be my guide if/when I go that way.
3,A good start for beginners,"This book does not represent a healthy living foods diet. The book suggests eating raw meat, raw fish and raw dairy products. Studies have recently shown that high protein diets lead to excretion of calcium in the urine and ultimately osteoporosis.Increased consumption of dairy is also linked with increases in prostate cancer, breast cancer and other diseases. The bovine insulin growth factor in milk promotes growth in the calf for whom the milk was intended but when consumed by humans can lead to excessive growth of cells, cancer cells and weight gain in sensitive individuals.Raw dead animals do not constitute living foods, decaying flesh is not health promoting food. I wouldn't recommend this book at all."
1,Unreliable information--Badly written,"There is nothing of value here. Alt eats raw foods, including raw eggs, fish and meats. Hard to believe this was ghost-written. The narrative is singularly unexciting. Information given on one page often contradicts what was said on the previous page. There is no science here. Nor are there any lively, relevant anecdotes. No advice of value to any of us. While Alt is a beauty, it appears that is due almost entirely to good genes. Don't waste your money!"
3,Okay Book,"I have been exploring the raw food diet for some time now and decided to purchase this book as a beginners guide. While Carol's own story can be interesting at times, I felt as though too much of the book was devoted to her personal journey and not enough to the actual implementation of the diet itself. The recipe section is small and as other reviewers have noticed most of the recipes were from other authors. Mind you I have no issue with using others' recipes however but I would expect that section to be much larger if you are going to go that route. I did like the resource section although it seems that some establishments I know of were not included and some listed were no longer valid. I learned a bit but not really much and ended up getting a couple of other books which were much more helpful to me."
3,"A Few Good Recipes, but....","I thought this book had some good information that is useful to those wanting to adopt healthier eating. However, there weren't many recipes, and be aware that some of them use RAW FISH. So, if you are interested in only vegan cuisine, you might want to skip this one.Also, if you have already done some background research and are not very new to raw fooding, half of this book is a waste. What I did like from this book was the almond milk cheat recipe (uses raw almond butter) and the tiramisu recipe (this one was quite interesting).If you're that curious about this book, just do what I did, and read it on the sofa at your local B&N.; For a better raw food book, check my other review of The Complete Book of Raw Food."
5,Practical and Profound Information,"Carol's book is totally down to earth about raw food. I was once one of those total sceptics who thought 'raw food?!! you gotta be kidding!!!'. But Carol is so down to earth about why and what and how, that I thought I'd try it. For years, I have suffered from chronics asthma and allergies, and after only 2 weeks on this diet I have zero allergies and my asthma is way down, to the point where I only need half of my normal medication. And, I am only doing raw foods 70% of the time. It is my impression that over time, my asthma will entirely be healed. There is no need for extremism here. Carol takes a very practical, realistic approach. And the most amazing thing that I have found is how incredibly FULL and SATISFIED I feel on the raw foods diet. After trying just about every 'natural' and medicinal cure I could find for my asthma and allergies, there is FINALLY something that WORKS. Thank you, Carol."
5,A beginners intro - simple and easy to follow,"After having had to change my diet the last few years ... this book caught my eye especially with the beautiful photo of Carol Alt on the cover. I remember seeing the author in Cover Girl ads as a kid and was stunned by how she looked better than ever. If the proof is in the pudding .. make it a raw-food vegan based desert compliments of Carol Alt! This is an easy to follow intro that helps the transition to raw food eating whether at home or in the restaurants. Raw food is a major change and if you have been thinking about (or perhaps need to) make a dramatic shift in your eating habits... give this a look. Besides, take one look at Carol and you'll be motivated by the side effect of her natural good looks that no cosmetic surgery technique can compete with."
1,All About Me by Carol Alt,"This book was not only poorly written, it seemed the author was more interested in making sure everyone knew who she was, how beautiful she'd been, how many photographs of her were on covers of magazines in her glory days, her high profile entertainment lifestyle, etc. than in conveying helpful information about converting to a raw foods lifestyle. Although raw fish I suppose qualifies, I was disappointed at its inclusion. I've gotten much more helpful information from the internet (at no charge!) by searching for ""raw foods"" in a search engine. I had never heard of Carol Alt prior to reading this book. Maybe this was just a vehicle for her re-entry into the limelight."
1,"Me, Me, Me . . . oh, and a little about RAW foods","UGH! A beautiful outside does not a beautiful inside make. You're better off turning to a different book if you want to learn about eating raw, unless for some weird reason you are a Carol Alt stalker."
4,nutbuster,great tool! only con I have is cutter on mine seems to be a little soft. But I use it on farm equipment and such so it gets a workout!
2,Colorful but not particularly helpful to climbers,"It's a nice travelogue but it is not much help to someone looking to climb the mountain itself.Look to Carmichael's ""Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro"" for that."
2,"Not bad, but not very good","So-so comedy from Spain about a thirty-something widow (Emma Suárez) who falls in love with a younger gay man (Juan Diego Botto).Very funny in places (the best scene is where the gay man tries to figure out how to make love to a woman.) But all too often the situations that are supposed to be funny fall flat.The most serious problem, though, is the casting. There is absolutely no chemistry between the leads. Botto is charming and appealing and quite sweet. But Suarez totally lacks charisma. She is a big zero in that department. It isn't that she is a bad actress or bad looking or anything like that. But to imagine a gay man would be so smitten with her that he would be willing to try to change his sexual orientation is ridiculous. With a charismatic leading actress the film would have had a better chance to succeed."
1,Never got my DVD due to poor warehouse inventory planning,"I never received the DVD. All I received was a ""Sorry no inventory, here's your money back. Good bye""."
1,Not for me...,"I don't like the texture of the cloths or the smell. It does an ok job of removing make up, not any better or worse than others. I did feel a film on my face afterward. Going back toGarnier and Neutrogena. I honestly can't recommend these. I was surprised because if the reviews...it's like they had a different product that I did. I don't have sensitive skin, though I have allergies. It not only left the film, but I was a little itchy. Nasty."
5,Original Autographed Copy!!,"I bought this as ""used"" from a private seller and when it arrived I was thrilled to receive an original autographed cover. Bobby Moderow, Jr. was the originator of the group and one member has been changed in the last few years. They appear at Duke's Canoe Club in Waikiki Friday afternoons late and then now have performance on Tuesday Nights at the Edge Bar in the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel on the beach. This group is true Hawaiian style music. I recommend all of their albums and visiting Waikiki if you are in the islands to see them live. They also have a website, [...] where you can read all the information on their history as a group. Excellent, awesome musicians!!"
3,"Cute, but...","The mystery is very engaging, and the clues ar worth it. As a CSI fan, I really enjoyed this book, but...The author's prose is far to heavy at times, particualrly in his descriptive mode. I felt that his ""purple prose"" interfered in me geting an idea about what he was describing. The plot is very good, but plowing through the excess descriptives made it hard for me."
4,Need to be updated,"This is one of the best paperback that I've ever bought, but it needs to be completed with some example forms and reviewed by the author. Also, it should be translated into spanishJeannidalia Grullon Maximo Grullon Sucs., S.A. Insurance Brokers Dominican Republic"
1,I need caffeine!,"My senior management seminar class used the previous edition of this book. Reading this book is the verbal equivalent of valium -- but not as much fun. You'll be snoozing in no time.And the other reviewers aren't kidding about the book being WAY too wordy. It takes a ton of pages to explain any concept. It's almost as if the authors thought that in order to make the textbook look legit for a management class, they had to make it ridiculously thick. Boooooorrrrrring."
5,One of my all time favorite business books,"This book was the text for my college strategic management class, and it was one of my favorite text books (and classes.) Many of my classmates also liked this it. The case studies were very interesting, and the book gave insight into successes and failures of well known and not so well known companies. It may be somewhat wordy, but it's packed with useful information and analysis."
1,Extremely Wordy,"I found the book to be extremely wordy. As I read the book, I found myself having to remind myself what the chapter (or topic) was suppose to be covering. Many of the statements in the book are common sense and points are repeated over and over through-out the text. The books is loaded with long list consisting of from 4-12 items. The list appear to be attempts by the authors to include every possible idea they could think of. My Professor used the questions from the test bank and many of the answers were buried in the readings. The cases studies were interesting, and the information on the website helps with the case analysis. Although after reading one of the chapters, any reading was interesting. Reading this book became a chore. If the book is required for class, start reading now because the way the book is written will make you procrastinate."
1,I can't believe they are selling this book!,I found this book incredibly boring and redundant. I am suprised that this book has survived 11 editions. Thomas and Strickland don't you read the reviews? Not worth my money!
5,A great tool to explain child neglect to a young person.,"A wonderfully illustrated and written book about an neglected flower who wants to be taken care of by someone. Once that somone is found, the flower blossoms into its ultimate beauty. This story provids an excellant tool as an analogy to the condition that exists in an abused childhood situation."
5,great cd,"for less than a buck a song you are getting your money's worth and more. this is by far the most underrated band, why can't they get big? I wish i lived in california. This cd is one of the best of mtx's -""i believe in you"" is such a refreshing song...share the feeling, buy this now!"
1,Exciting Times Ahead,Just kidding. Reading this book was about as exciting as watching paint dry. Even Dr. Suess was more informative.
2,not that good,"cheese slice holder won't stay closed. butter container is just a wee bit smaller than a stick of butter/margarine, can fit one in it but will be a bit scrape off on the out side. the only containers I'm using are the lettuce keeper, cream cheese, and the tomato/onion keeper. they work fine."
5,Great Christmas gift.,"I ordered one of these as a gift last Christmas. It was so nice and very pretty, I could not part with it. Decided to get two more this year and use as gifts. I love mine."
4,Great Teaching Tool for Kids,"I bought this for neighbor friends of mine, and I find it to be a great tool so that they are having fun watching a cartoon while learning various safety rules. It is neat to go outside and see them put what they learned into action sometimes even quoting the movie. The whole Danger Ranger collection is great for young people."
3,Teeny Weeny,I guess I should have measured 4.5inch on a ruler. This comb is too small to really be use-worthy. There is nothing wrong with it. It is my fault that i didnt realize just how small it is. You'd be wise to get a bigger one.
1,Disappointed,"Mislead on what you are getting......one comb not three. Even though it says ""combs"". You only get the small one. Will not order from this seller again."
5,BRILLIANT!,"This CD is absolutely the best. It is brilliantly clevor, funny, completely age-appropriate, and brings a delicate and difficult subject for toddlers out into the open. Most importantly, it works! I had given this CD twice, both to dear friends who were parents of toddlers who were finding potty training to be a challenge. They both say it changed their life. And when I had my own little one, I was frantic when I couldn't find ""Potty Animals."" So I am now delighted to have once again found it at Amazon. ""Potty Animals"" makes potty training a fun and musical adventure for little ones, and makes it all SO LESS stressful for their parents. (Plus, we sing along too!)"
1,ripoff,"This exact set can be obtained used online for about 60 dollars, and new, sealed in the box, for about 150 - from many different sellers. There is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for this price."
4,Ferris Conspiracy,"Unlike quite a few Ferris was/is a smart criminal. It's interesting to have it confirmed that the police and 'other powers that be' are also criminal/violent/discriminatory in their actions.Everyone who is poor knows this but middle classers often DON'T know this!Also Ferris genuinely would like to empower his 'own people' but the system doesn't let him. Having said that, crims are much the same everywhere in the world.Where there is poverty,there is crime and Glasgow has plenty of poverty!I hope this book will perhaps help to create understanding and thereby improve opportunities and aspirations for underpriviliged people.Despite that, Glasgow is a great city!"
1,Its just not for me.,"I love using their moisturizer and face wash. Unfortunately, this product makes my face really oily."
4,"Quick read, entertaining, light humor with good insight",Andi Lane's adventures in and out of the nursing home keep the book moving at a lively pace. Andi Lane could be the start of many sequel adventure novels.It helped me understand more about the nursing home environment and why it's important.
3,Helmet is so big its crazy looks like your wear on of those vader costums,Helmet is so big its crazy... looks like your wearing one of those Vader costume Helmetsi wont wear it for that reason a lone.other then that looks good well made
3,Helmet,"The friend whom I purchased it for did not like how much padding/protection was in the helmet & that it sat to high on his head to due it being (DOT standards). If he was to ever be ivolved in an accident, apparently he would rather have his brains smashed all over the pavement by wearing a non DOT less padded helmet. I thought it looked great, great price & was shipped right away."
1,Dont Do It !!!,"Helmet fit like a Yalmika. i got a ""large"" and it didnt even fit my 10 year old sister. and im not sayind it didnt Look large on her head. she looked like a martian. i didnt listen to someone elses review. Please listen to mine."
1,german helmet black,"my opinion on this item in not good at all. its intérior in made of cheap foam and no good for safety and confort....as far as I am concerne, it is good for garbage...not worth to buy"
1,Returned this helmet right away.,"This helmet looks really dumb when you actually get it, way too bulky and big and sticks up off your head about 2 inches. Only product I have ever returned from amazon."
3,Good looking but runs small.,"I wanted the look of this helmet but also with the DOT rating. Achieved both but unfortunately the helmet runs small. If you decide to order, order at least one size up."
4,Great product,Great helmet and and great customer service ..would recommend to everyone. Not cheap helmet like some of these other cheap helmets you see online. Great padding and color.
2,Get what you pay for,"Cut very small. Has a definite styrofoam feel to the inside. I like the German look, but it's just not a high quality helmet."
3,Should have listened to the reviews first!,"I have a non-DOT big German that I have had for years and I love it. Unfortunately I left it in the garage and some squirrels got into it and puff, no more nice German helmet. This helmet looks great and the company is great but there are a few issues.1) In my opinion, this helmet runs a little on the small size so if you are towards the larger size of helmet range, go for the larger one.2) It is BIG, it is BULKY, and it is heavy and quite uncomfortable. Compared with my non-DOT there is no comparison at all. I suppose that is the sacrifice of a true DOT helmet. Just wish they could make this one a little... uh better."
2,helmet review,"helmet was right style but not very stylish on. It sets up way to far from your head and looks funny, needs to be deeper set on the inside.Functional as DOT approved, but not very fashionable on."
3,Big Helmet,The helmet is quality built & DOT approved. This one is much larger than the small ones you have seen that are not DOT approved.
3,"Good Price, Easy to deal with shipper","Price was fine and product arrived in a timely manner. However, it just did not sit well on my head. Returning the product was just as quick, and easy as receiving it. I had my money back in a relatively short period of time."
3,Helmet review,This is a good quality helmet but sits a little high on the head... I guess if you want the old school german look you have to buy one with no protection.. The good ole brain bucket. Atleast this one would protect your head a little bit if you got in a wreck.
4,Great quality but definitely bulky,"I realy like the German helmet style but as others have said the DOT ones are bulky. The fitment was perfect, I bought the XXL helmet and it fit great. I personaly just didn't care for the look when it is on. My wife said it looks like a ""mushroom top"" get it?! I would buy from them again just probably not a DOT German helmet. For the price I'm keeping it. It has already worked great as a spare."
3,Huge,"Looks cool off your head, gigantic on it. I feel like Rick Moranis in Space Balls. Thats what I get for buying DOT helmet I suppose. I've seen uglier helmets but this one doesn't have the slender look of the novelty German helmet."
1,Awful Manufacturer!,"This product was falling apart before I even took it out of the box. The styrofoam that was supposed to be glued or sewn into the shell of the helmet was not properly attached. And it was also three sizes too small. I wouldn't have kept it for free. I was totally unsatisfied, and disappointed that they would even ship something so terribly bad."
4,helmet,it got to me fast looks nice and it was cheep. im very satisfied good stuff nice stuff good product
4,***quick shipping *** good purchase,"We had a mail strike here in Canada, I recievced notice right awayafter the strike that the helmet was in. It was in great shape and although my husband hasn't wore it yet it's still an awesome piece!!**UPDATE**I actually have returned the helmet in favour of a smaller size since my husband didn't like the fit and are waiting the smaller one. Returns with this company are very easy."
5,Fabulous,"The milk & honey salt scrub has a wonderful honey scent, not overpowering. I have very fair, dry skin. I love this scrub because the salt scrubs off the old skin, and imperfections, while the oils seep in and soften, so the end result is silky smooth ,soft skin. This scrub is not as oily as some others I've tried. There was no slippery oily patch in the shower-I love to use this on my feet and legs. Also makes dry scaly elbows a thing of the past. If you have very dry skin, salt scrub are an essential I hear it's also good for Eczema.This is great when I need some girl time."
4,Nice looking with one drawback,"I generally like the watch and wear it as my dress watch now. It is light and handsome. My only issue is that, at age 50, the date is too small for me to see without my glasses on."
2,two time looser,"This is the second one I have bought. The 1st would not charge out of the box and ran for only 20 seconds. This one runs fine and they both ollked great. The problem with number two is the stem. It will reset the time, but not the date. If the date gets ahead you must run through the month or stop time to let reality catch up with the watch. It looks fine, but there are problems using the ""thing "" as a time peace."
2,"Tinny watch, sent it back","I had an older Citizen ecodrive titanium watch that needed repair, decided to replace instead. I found this product to be far inferior in appearance and ""feel"" though I am sure it would function well. Sent it back and am having my old one repaired."
1,Very poor decision,"I was not very happy with the watch. I bought it with the name of a dive watch, and the thought of resistant up to 20bar. Well i took this on a dive the other day. Went down to 40ft for about 40min. Finished my dive and went up washed off my gear and my self. Got home and checked the time to see how much more time i had till work and low and behold my watch had stopped. Now i am out $255, and citizen refused to repair my watch. They said it isn't ment for diving."
3,Good Watch,"I like the watch very much. This is my second eco drive watch and they both last a long time. The main reason I like eco drive is the solar power allows the quartz watch to maintain accuracy and water tightness without ever having to remove the cover to replace the battery which leads to no longer water resistant. The reason I gave this watch a 3 stars is the chrono second hand (the red hand) was received not aligned to 0 second. It was always at about 59 seconds. Now after about 4 years of use, the second hand is now at 58 seconds. Great reliability but lousy quality control to ship with the second hand not aligned."
3,WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT WOULD BE,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND. IT'S A VERY GOOD LOOKING WATCH VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND NOT CLUNKY. I HAD TO RETURN IT BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO READ THE DATE.
2,"Nice, but if the crystal ever needs replacement, good bye waterproof","I have this watch, and I generally like it, but I cannot take it in the shower or the bath, much less in the ocean, because it is not waterproof. I had to replace the crystal (sent to service center by seller, as stated by other reviewer it takes weeks) and thereafter it has not been waterproof. The first couple of times the movement had to be replaced, it was under warranty at least, but the last time it cost me. I have had no problems with the wrist band.Frank Scalfano"
2,Not too goog :(,The watch is very low qaulity and the crown won't stay in it's place for long.I was expecting a better watch from Citizen. I decided to return it.
1,"Poor quality, poor service","I own a Citizen Eco-Drive Titanium Watch, and I have had nothing but problems with it. Within a few years the band was badly fading and falling apart (replacement cost over $200), and the crystal scratched easily and needed replaced ($60). After spending the money to fix the crystal, two weeks later the movement completely quit (repair cost $172). Anytime you send the watch in for service, it takes weeks just to get an estimate. It then takes another two weeks to get the watch back. If you want a decent looking dress watch, pick another brand. The Citizen brand durability and warranty is inexcusable."
4,Awesome workout,This is a great tape for toning and strengthening. I highly recommend Jane Fonda's Workouts.Jane Fonda's Workout With Weights
3,A little too small,"This is a very cool looking little bag, for the stylish little girl. The princess barbie barely fits in the box and it seems like it would only realistically hold 3 barbies. I will be returning it and exchanging for a bigger storage container for Ms. Barbie and her friends, and her accessories. :)"
4,Exactly as I'd expect,"This item works exactly as I'd expect; I purchased it for a Dell Inspiron 1000 which accepts a single RAM module in addition to the built-in 256 MB. That machine only seems to support PC2100 memory (266MHz), but this ended up being cheaper than any PC2100 I could find and is backward-compatible, so it works fine. I've done no serious ""burn-in"" testing, but have been running the laptop on it for several weeks without difficulty.All in all, recommended as a working no-frills inexpensive piece of memory for laptops that support it."
3,Legata Ad Un Granello Ai Sabbia,"I've been looking for this song for more than 10 years. I do hope that I can buy disc 3 only. Please inform me. These songs remind me when we were young since my father was a song lover, we used to have these songs (long play album) way back more than twenty years ago when I was still in the Philippines. I'm glad that I can find it here. Thanks Amazon's webssite."
5,Great Deal for Great ink,"When dealing with ink for photographic printers the best bet is to stick with the ink that is reconmended for that printer. That however can lead to issues of overpaying for a name brand, however with this deal from Amazon you are making out. Around where I live the indvidual colors cost between $13 - $15 a piece. With this deal, even with shipping you're spending about $10 per color. The saving adds up..."
5,Ditto on these inks.,I use these inks for all my printing and the quality of photo printing is extremely high. Epson ink and printers have never failed me.
2,Tanning with your eyes open wide!,"This album is incredibly ambient with lots of electronic sounds floating, and breathy voices echoing in and out of the stratosphere. Pacific is simple in its structure; and for the most part is listenable. At timed it tries to do way too much of the underwater country and emo blend for the eardrums, but their down-tempo jinglebell opiate trip is a recommendation if you like slower music that's stuck between trying to impress the scenesters and rehashing acoustic grunge. Overall I'd say this album would be perfect for a midnight mescaline trip on a west-coast beach, or some other equally applicable deviation. The group includes Lucas Jensen, clay, and Howard Hudson, and is currently playing shows to support the release. Visit their website and show the band some support at http://www.thewarmsupercomputer.com. Content copyright www.maximumink.com"
4,Orders Crucial RAM received Kingston,"The memory works fine, but I ordered Crucial RAM and received Kingston RAM. The Kingston memory is working fine, just not what I ordered."
5,PC3200 DDR RAM,"I have been using crucial ram for six years now, I have one machine with 2GB runningXP Pro and my other machine has 3GB running Vista Ultimate. The XP machine is muchfaster, with only a 2.8GHZ intel P4 while the vista machine is running a 3.2GHZintel P4. The more I use my vista machine the more I like it. I give it 5 starbecause it performs well for me."
1,What a shame!,"I can't write a review of this item. I'm still waiting for it. Wrote to Crucial and got nothing, not even an answer..."
4,A welter of spume among the outer limits,"Gardner Dozois' collection of short stories is what the original Outer Limits TV show would have been if it was aimed at a more intellectual audience and there were no censors. Dozois explores the most disturbing reaches of the human mind, setting his tales in worlds positively choking with a thick, suffocating atmosphere that comes right off the page and envelopes the reader. This guy can really set a mood. The last two pieces, A Special Kind of Morning and Chains of the Sea, represent a master of the sci-fi short story at the top of his form."
3,ok,"I expected more of a biography. Some included, but if you aren't familiar with prophets, or the gift of prophecy, it may be too much information for you. it was for me."
3,A little watery but smells great!,"i love the smell of Realities but this lotion is a bit watery and the pump shoots the lotion out way to far, too fast! other than that it was an ok deal!"
2,Cartridge failed,"The Cyan cartridge stopped working after very few copies which caused us some problems. Inkers promptly sent a shipping label and refunded the money for this cartridge. The company support was excellent. The remanufactured toner cartridge quality is not trustworthy. I'd consider buying from Inkers again, but not this product."
2,Suspicious tape across the factory sealed end.,"When you are an office that gets many dozens of cartridges a year, and none of them are suspiciously taped across the factory sealed end from the top to the bottom, you might think this is not an OEM cartridge...no? We cannot be 100% sure it is or isn't but the taped end makes us think it's not...the seller claims it is to keep the box safe while shipping, You can decide for yourself if you want to make this purchase."
5,q6471a retail condition,Product arrived promptly and in great condition. The package was in another box and was in excellent perfect retail condition.
3,Alright,"Delivery was quick. But I had some issues with the disk skipping/freezing. I have a brand new dvd player, so I know that was not the problem. Bought the set new, so I question whether it was actually ""new""."
4,Season One Accomplished,The CD's came in perfect condition and the cases were clean and organized. Overall great shipping time and dvd case was in great condition.
5,Great Show,"When this show first began, I wasn't too sure whether it would be something I would like, as it seemed like a horrendous topic with characters that were 'stiff'. But, after watching for a few episodes, I really began to get interested in what they go through trying to find these diabolic 'monsters' and that, even with all the gruesome scenes they have to attend and handle, there is still a camaraderie between the characters and fun/humor. Love the show now and wouldn't miss a one."
5,Great !,This is one of the best series. And you learn a couple of things in the process of watching.
5,Love this series,I recently started watching this show and I haven't been able to stop. I fly through a season a week and the story lines only get better. Definitely a must watch.
5,Great pick,This is a great show! If you like crime shows with good plots you will love criminal minds. ThisIs the first season and it starts out great . The show is about crimes that are solved by the BAUBehavior Analysis unit. They study behavior and come up with a profile for the killer. They are then able to come up with suspects that fit that profile and solve the crime . This show never fails to please and is exciting and at times heartbreaking I give it five stars
5,Love it,I love this series. It was in great condition. I would recommend this DVD set to anyone who loves it on TV.
3,Gift,"I liked watching this series, but gave this as a gift!! CD's worked right! Great product though...thanks for selling it"
5,Criminal Minds Season 1,Brilliant show! Takes the normal crime shows and adds a great twist. Every episode is great!
4,I got closed captioning on a cheaper VCR/DVD machine.,"I have no idea why but using the same red, white and yellow cables, I finally got closed captioning when I switched out my multi-region Opppo DVD player for my cheapo Philips VCR/DVD combo that I got at Target a year ago.I suggest experimenting with the video plug in as many outlets on the tv set as it will fit to find closed captioning. I am using a more than ten year old big box tv set and a newer but cheapo VCR/DVD to get cc. I also get cc from my twenty plus year old VCRs."
2,bad discs,"The discs were pretty good, save that disc four was scratched to a point that two episodes were unwatchable and disc six seemed to be compleatly erased. I was very disappointed in the quality of the product. Scratches were expected but a compleatly blank disc wasn't."
2,A plea for subtitles...,"Here we go again. Another dvd set lacking subtitles.Criminal Minds is a great show with a wonderful cast (especially Mandy Patinkin or should I say ""Inigo Montoya""?So why is it that the producers/packegers refuse to put subtitles into these dvds? Does it add that much to the cost?I am now encountering the exact same lack with season 2 of the show.It really distracts from the experience because in order for my rock and roll ruined ears to hear, the sound has to be up at a level that drives my poor wife nuts."
4,SAE Review,"An excellent show. It has positive plot development, good character richness and keeps you guessing. In a busy genre, it stands out."
5,Criminal Minds,This is my favorite show. My 13 year old son asked for the first two seasons for Christmas and luckily Santa was able to find it on amazon.com. Thanks Amazon!
4,MANDY PATINKIN,"SO I REALLY LIKE THIS SHOW. IT IS BELIEVABLE AND STEADY. NOTHING TO OUT THERE. BUT NOW I'M CAUGHT UP IN IT HAVING PURCHASED THIS AND I FIND OUT MANDY PATINKIN IS LEAVING. IN A QUANDRY. HOW MUCH MORE TIME AND MONEY DO I INVEST? WILL HIS REPLACEMENT KEEP ME AS SETTLED AS HE MADE ME FEEL. HE HAS A WAY OF MAKING YOU FEEL THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS IS OKAY. IM NOT SORRY FOR THE PURCHASE JUST WISH THINGS WEREN'T ALWAYS CHANGING ON TV LIKE REAL LIFE. IM WAY TO INVESTED IN TELEVISION, LOL"
1,Horrible!!,"First, they sent me the wrong product. I bought Season 1, but what I got was Season 2. Ok, so I could live with that since Iwas going to buy it after the 1st season anyways....but then none of the DVD's worked!! I tried in my son's X-Box, but it would not read ANY of the DVD's; so then I tried it in my DVD player, and it read them...somewhat. The DVD's kept freezing. I couldnt even get through one single episode!! When I emailed the company to see if they could help me, they told me to contact Amazon because they do nto handle that kind of stuff. I mean, really?!?! Whatever happened to customer service?!?! I will not be buying another product from them.....Good luck to you all!!"
1,no es lo que dicen,"la serie es excelente, yo la compre pero, en la pagina dice que viene en español y es una farsa no tiene ni subtitulos en español me decepciono mucho AMAZON por vender algo que no viene como lo describen"
3,It is TINY:(,"Great organic quality, but it is SO much smaller than a crib blanket. I'm not sure whay they are selling it under that title. it was dissapointing."
4,Mystery's own drama queen,"For theatre fans who also happen to like mysteries Jane Dentinger is a particular treat. Her New York actress/sleuth Jocelyn O'Roarke involves us in investigations where she is a professional actress but an amateur snoop. In this one Jocelyn pursues the murderer of the star of a summer-stock production of ""Peter Pan."" Jocelyn/Jane is funny, bitchy, and full of details about both the theatre and crime. If this is your milieu, this is your book."
3,More of a picture book,"This book has a lot of photos of beautiful Mustangs. If you are looking for a book to see some restored Mustangs, than this is the book for you. However, I thought it would be more of a ""how to"" book. The title is somewhat deceiving, it's not really a guide to restoring your car."
2,Not very sturdy,"The organization is good for the tools, but the zipper does not stay zipped, so my tools fall out when I am carrying it. Not a product I would recommend to anyone else."
2,"A dry, detached commentary on the sutra","Having read a great deal of Buddhist literature over the last 4-5 years I think I've become sensitive to those writers who can make a strong personal connection with their readers and those who cannot. The author of this book, it seems to me, cannot - at least not in this particular book. This is a very doctrinaire, dry commentary on the Sutra of Complete Enlightenment. There is little here for any but the most devoted of buddhist scholars, and even then I doubt there is much. The glowing testimonials from Thich Nach Hanh and other prominent buddhists notwithstanding, this one struck me as a tiresome exercise in the most mainstream of buddhist dogma with nothing much new or interesting to say."
3,"Interesting, but ""The Basics of Nichiren Buddhism, SGI-Style"" would be better","This is an interesting book and the author's straightforward writing-style is refreshing. It is also a fact that I am impressed by any version of Buddhism which avoids self-indulgence, and Nichiren Buddhists seem to have an outward-looking approach to their faith. Nevertheless, this book does not discuss any kind of Buddhism besides that promulgated by Soka Gakkai, one of the ""new religions"" that have sprung up in Japan in the past century. If you want to know more about Buddhism in general, look elsewhere."
2,BEWARE! a little deceptive,"Anyone who is familiar with and looking for the larger approx. 6"" x 5"" x 2"" tome (like I was) and is not aware that a smaller abridged version exists, is going to be sorely disappointed! Even though the Amazon description says ""756 pages, 719 illustrations"" IT DOES NOT CONTAIN NEARLY THAT!! That is the description of the derivative material that appears in the back of this TINY (32 pages, 4"" x 3 1/4"" x 1/4"") booklet! It would seem that since there is no traditional frontspiece with publisher's info for this booklet, and careless listings allow this derivative bibliography to stand for what this book has- and that is INACCURATE. It is charming as a small ""amusement"", but use caution before ordering to make sure you are getting what you are seeking."
2,Disappointed,"I thougt the book was the big one, the pictures show an index and it indexes more than 700 pages. But the one I received was shorter than my hand, and only contains a few pics from the big book.There should be some warning that this is not the hardcover book. That's why I'm disappointed."
4,LOL!,this book rocks! it is hillarious. it is especially interesting to look at depictions of acts that are now taboo.
1,Poor editing gets in the way of good information...,"I can't make it through a chapter without getting completely frustrated. The editing is very poor and it reads like a college course syllabus. It's too bad because I'm sure there are diamonds of information in there....you just have to persevere I guess. I don't have that patience. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book until it's been re-vamped."
5,Just Excellent,I got this book from a bookseller in my area and was captivated by such diverse accounts. I have some time on my hands and I plan to explore this topic very deeply. I think I will check out everything by Professor Taylor too. This was a surprise and a treat.
5,Good Specialty Find,"This is a very good scholarly collection of articles about death and burial rituals. We ordered this for the library after one of our high school students used it for a report. Her teacher asked us to purchase it.If your topic is death and burial rituals, look no further. This Berkeley professor collects everything you need in a way that makes sense.My husband, not involved in the library sciences, thinks it is strange for me to be reading this book at night. I try to read and write about all new purchases for the library."
3,Great product for the money,This Item was easy to install and well worth the money. It worked as it was expected to work.
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah","I did not believe the story of the characters at all, neither was well developed. The author also tried to go down the path of the ""dark, brooding"" lead that will alone save the world and he did not pull it off. I also did not like some of the writing; I found it a bit forced or dry. Not much between the covers. Sure the story sounds interesting, but somehow that does not translate to what is actually written. Overall, this is not that great of a book. There are many others out there that are better."
4,A worthwhile purchase,"I picked this album up off of a suggestion from a friend, and I must say that it is a better punk album than i've listened to for a while. If you're more a traditional punk fan, you'll probably be a bit dissapointed with the CD. However, that's what made it great for me, was the fact that it wasn't a traditional punk album. Although some of the songs' core riffs seem lifted from Minor Threat/Fugazi, the band puts their own swing onto the rest of the song. Besides, how many punk bands can actually say that they've never reused chord progressions? The Wynona Riders have made a proficient CD that is a very enjoyable listen. It strays from punk sometimes, but that shows orginality to me, especially the way they mix it in. If you can find the CD, I suggest picking it up."
5,Very good deal!,My husband bought this and it is without a doubt one of the most useful tools he has....and that is quite a bit. He says the batteries stay charged and the tools have the power he needs. Way to go AMAZON on having a great deal today!
5,Estremely pleased,Have been using the drill and recip saw since I got them and am extremely pleased with the purchase. I have a wired recip saw that dowesn't cut as efficiently as this and the drill is far better than any I've used.
3,Where's the map?,"Lovely little book for carrying along while touring the squares, but there is no legible map. The tiny print on the shuttle guide is impossible to read.However, the photos and brief histories are excellent."
1,Crap,"Cheap, handmade packaging. DVDs that seem to be poorly made copies, without chapter or scene selections etc... Don't buy it- huge rip off."
2,Good Information...Poorly Presented,"There is a lot of good information in the book but it is poorly presented. The page stock is cheap, the pictures are dim and fuzzy, picture captions are difficult to read and the contrast between the page background and the text was so close it made reading many of the pages very difficult, especially the pages that are intended to look like yellowed pages from an old notebook. It almost appears that the pages were meant to be printed in color and then the decision was made to print it in grey-scale. This could have been a very good reference book. I was very disappointed in it and would not recommend its purchase. I'm glad that I only paid a discounted price for it."
2,Poor quality printing,"While this book is a quaint and informative look at how folks viewed camping in the past, the quality of the book is extremely poor and shockingly substandard. It looks as if someone scanned the pages of an old book, printed them out on a cheap printer, then copied those pages and bound them in a book. If this were a $5 book, maybe this would be understandable, but after shipping, it is over $20. Amazon needs to come up with a system of grading the print quality of its books. This is not the first time I have been unpleasantly surprised after opening a package from Amazon."
2,Disappointed - It didn't work.,I ordered several DVDs at the same time. All of them worked great except this one! This one did not play on the DVD player. I could ONLY play it on my computer. This is disappointing since it was gift for my father.
2,spray bottle too tall for smaller hands.,Product is too difficult to use because the bottle is too tall to position hands for proper use according to package directions. Also has slightly odd smell.
2,Didnt Work,Here it is 2 months later and I still got fleas hopping around my place....nothing seems to be really working...I used this first so I wouldn't have to bomb the joint but I ended up still having to bomb the place..I've bought/used everything I could think of...and they just won't die...I'm ready to call in the air force to drop a real bomb on the joint....smdh!!!
5,Great product ...,"This product really helped clear up our flea problem last summer. We tried several products before, but our vet recommended this and it really worked! I recommend!"
2,Dud product,"This, also, isn't worth the money they want for it. I sprayed my carpet & guess what!!! I still had fleas 3 days later! Don't waste your money!"
1,Are you people Crazy! Learn about Jesus from the Bible!,"Check your sources before you read!Contains many astounding revelations that support our faith, yet are not contained in the Bible or in any other sacred literature.This extraordinary work contains a day-by-day and frequently hour-by-hour account of the three years of the Public Life of Christ, actually witnessed in vision by one of the greatest mystics of the 18th century.Learn about Jesus from the Bible! Don't learn about Jesus from an 18th Century mystic!!!"
3,So so movie,"I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase this, but it was the first time that I used Amazon's streaming service so..."
1,Really bad,"Worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is atrocious, I mean atrocious! It's so bad I couldn't even watch it. I assume the other reviewers are devout Christians who are able to overlook anything as long as there's some preaching going on, but seriously, don't waste your time."
3,A private eye investigates Native American fishing rights,"John Dennison, Seattle private eye teams up with his darts-throwing Cowlitz Indian buddy, Willie Prettybird, to investigate a Cowlitz claim to Native American salmon fishing rights. A judge is murdered and dismembered parts show up in Seattle's Pioneer Square. All take a tour of the Seattle underground. Gets convoluted, loses focus, and doesn't end very neatly."

A judge is murdered and dismembered parts show up in Seattle's Pioneer Square. All take a tour of the Seattle underground. Gets convoluted, loses focus, and doesn't end very neatly. Found this copy in the public library."
4,"Dash it all, I forget how it ended!","But I'm pretty certain it started well, and entertained me some.One or two of the characters were a little odd, but that's OK, people are in real life too. (Will re-read and review again)"
5,Could not be better,"Anyone interested in car design must read and keep this book. Should be a mandatory reading in design schools and design departments of every automaker. Either as a historical document or as an artistic reference, this book is a feast of information and images.The author does not pretend to be an amateur car designer but instead humbly becomes a communication channel between the reader, Bob Gregorie and the memory of Edsel Ford, and a very good one indeed.Kudos to Henry Dominguez for not having succumbed to the temptation of using modern color pictures and having gone to the process of selection those amazing images from The Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village archives. Kudos to Henry Domiguez for such a fine book."
2,Bah!,"This game is just like the Super Nintendo versions of Madden, but this game is really not good.Graphics: 6/10. For an N64 game, this is not good. They only look a little bit better than the SNES Madden's.Control: 6/10. I find it somewhat difficult and it just doesn't feel right on an N64 controller.Sound: 6.5/10. Madden is there, but it is fuzzy and when you hit someone they make a stupid little ""tech umpf"" as I call it. It's really annoying and it's pointless.Fun: 6/10. This game fails. Just like the SNES with nothing more than an updated roster; there really is no fun to be had here and you are better off not playing it. I think it's a good thing it was only $3.99. Hell, there are better sports game for lower prices. If you're a fan of a ""realistic"" football game, try this, but if you want the best football experience on the N64 even if it is exaggerated and not realistic, try NFL Blitz/BFL Blitz 2000."
5,The Greatest Football Game Ever Made!,"A lot of people say that this game stinks, but they're wrong. Maybe the graphics aren't all that great but the gameplay is the best ever made. This game has no cheap juke it's more just breaking tackles. It also has year teams. The gameplay of this game is like older football games instead of the modern pansy ones."
5,Best phone I've ever used,"This is hands down the best phone I have ever used. The reception is great and when you use the headset, the clarity is amazing. Run down the list of features and it's basically got everything."
2,Better look for other phone (Nokia 6682),"I am not going to mention anything about the pros but am going to mention few cons1) Batter sucks .....looks like this phone eats up all the Li ion.2) Display is always on while talking..this eats the battery too3) POOR call quality4) Less functions to control the display and to save the power5) Small keys6) ADDRESS book: cannot hold 2 home numbers or 2 mobile numbers. Just one on eachThese are the problems, me and my friends are facing (Reviewed this phone after using 4 pieces)"
1,very disappointed,"I bought this phone specifically for it's music capabilities along with a 4GB card. The only way to create playlists is on the phone using it's nightmare menu system. I couldn't imagine how it could be worse - it really is that frustrating and time consuming.In all fairness to Sony, it's still a great phone, good camera, good sound quality if you use better headphones. A reasonable replacement for your MP3 player it is not."
1,sales scam,"you can't port your existing number with this deal unless you are willing to give up the discount rate and put in $250!!!!!11/4/06i am glad that i didn't get this deal. i shopped at the same phone store i shopped two years ago and i got a much better deal for a family plan of 4 (one w810i, two samsung d807) and net $30 cash back. =) and with number portability!!"
1,way to small,"when i tried out this phone it was way to small i couldnt fit my fingers on the buttons and it made it really difficult. I think u should think twice before bying this phone and consider the samsung d807, this phone has all of the same features except for the radio."
1,Dont buy this phone from here,I recently got this phone from amazon together with the Cingular family plan etc. The phone battery never gets fully charged no matter how long I charge it. And discharges after just 2 days with hardly 1 hr of talk time. From what i hear this phone is generally quite good but it seems these guys on Amazon are selling some defective pieces so please dont buy it from here if at all you want to buy it.
2,Worst experience!!!,"My rating has nothing to do with the phone but it's about how I am going to get this phone and when. I ordered one back the 1st of Octorber. The phone got shipped on 24th.... and never got to me... it turned that USPS lost the package somehow and somewhere. Now, I got no phone but Cingular Bill is sticking from October 25th and Amazon is replacing with the new phone. The problem is that the new phone wouldn't be shipped until 15th of this month... USPS, can you sure it's going to get to my door? I've never experienced something like this. Cingular doesn't care that you don't have phone, your phone bill started from the date Amazon shipped the phone.... I am so frustrated with the situation...I have no doubt that this an excellent phone."
1,Not so much a phone as a music player,"I think that if you use your phone as something to listen to music with (which seems kinda silly considering the superior quality in every way of ipods) then you might love this phone. As someone who uses a cell phone mostly AS A PHONE, I returned it after one day and opted for a blackberry pearl."
1,Run from Cingular,"This review is about Cingular service not particulary this phone. Customer service is about the worst for any company I have ever delt with.One month after starting service roadside assistance just happened ""to get added on my statements"" with no authorization and no explanation from Cingular. If you look up compaints in the BBB there are many instances of mis-information given out by Cingular customer service especially concerning concellation fees."
1,Worst Shipping,"Placed the order, Got the tracking number 2 days ago. Since two days I have been trying to track the package and every time it shows that the order is ready to be picked up by the carrier. Seems snice two days the package is in warehouse.I would not order through Amazon if I have another option available."
5,Best And Most Complete Phone Anywhere!,"This phone does everything right. It has more features than i will ever use. For me, phone reception and picture quality are most important -- and Cingular delivers. I will take a long trip soon to see how good reception is outside CA and then upgrade this review. So for it's the best phone I've bought and that includes my trusty Nokia 6230."
1,Sony Ericsson Needs to Fix the Walkman Audio Hiss Problem,"Great price on a great phone if you get the contract with Cingular. However, don't think you'll be able to ditch your dedicated mp3 player. SE has been very slow to address an audio hiss issue (caused by a firmware update) with the Walkman player on this phone, and it's not even clear they ever intend to fix it for this product. A great chance for SE to hit it out of the park with an amazing all-in-one device, but this audio problem on a WALKMAN-branded phone is ridiculous. And yes, I have the latest firmware. It fixed the Acura handsfree link problem, but audio is still sub-par."
4,A lot of features in a little bity space,"I've had 4 phones the last 2 months, and this is the phone I am keeping... for now... I have had an Apple iPhone, Nokia E62, Blackberry Curve, and weird thing this is the phone of my choice.I previously had a Nokia 6230 and I prefer the candybar style of a phone. I love the fact that this is tiny, compact, and has all the features of all these other phones. This is a quadband phone, it has a 2MP camera, plays music, takes pictures, with flash, takes videos as well, has FM radio, can be used as a modem, you can go online... so yeah.The only thing I don't like about this phone is there isn't any smart text messaging features like the Nokia brand phones.Other than that, its compact, filled with features and I love this phone... for now."
2,Synch Problems not mentioned,"One reason I got this phone is that I believed it would interact with my PC to load contacts, music, and my calendar. It comes with synchronization software and, while instructions are sparse, there is no reason to believe it would not work ... except it doesn't. After spending LOTS of time trying and going to the ""knowledge base"", I finally gave in and called customer support. I was told the phone CANNOT synchronize through the Media Center version of Windows XP because there is no compatible driver. So I now face the choices of 1)Entering everything by hand and doing without the mp3 function (Are you crazy?) 2)Waiting for the development of a compatible driver (Like that will happen soon) or 3)Giving them their crippled phone back. Probably #3, huh?"
1,Poor call quality with Cingular,"I purchased this phone with a 2-year contract with Cingular. Unfortunately I had to return this phone because of the very poor call quality with Cingular - and this was in the Los Angeles/Burbank city area, where supposedly Cingular has good coverage.The camera on the phone is ok. However transferring files between the phone and the computer is dodgy at best - it frequently would hang. Also, transfers are way too slow and requires you to access the files thru the software that comes with the phone.I wasn't too impressed by the usability/menu/navigation as well. However poor call quality trumps all the other issues.All in all it turned out to be a poor buy for me."
2,Frequent call drops,"I bought this phone with a family plane from Cingular a month ago. Trust me, I really want to like it. Great camera, mp3 player, FM radio ... But I frequently got dropped calls even if it displays a full bar. I tried to set the ""Preferred Service"" to ""GSM Only"", but it doesn't work. My wife's Moto KRAZ never has such problem in the same area I lives. So I figured it must be the phone itself. It looks like the only choice is to replace another type."
4,Sony W801i,Handy to take while traveling as a phone and camera. I don't have much use as a Walkman however.
2,Look good but there are many down sides for a phone!,"Cons:1. Speaker is not loud enough compare to any Motorola speaker phones.2. Too small to hold while talking.3. Small keypad.4. Screen display always on while talking. It will eat the battery out if you make a long call. The trick is to hit any navigation keys the screen will go off, but what if you have to enter some key response while making call.5. No alarm ringtone.6. Earsets feel funny in the ears, i dont know if it will damage to our ears or not (too loud and too close to the ears).7. Small speaker output at the top the phone compare to other phone.8. No separate headset output, it shares with the charging slot.Good:Look at other people's reviews."
2,Where's The Captioning?,"I have the previous Billy Jack box set and I bought this one because it was supposed to have closed captioning. To my disappointment there is no captioning on any of the movies. I like to have the captioning on so I can listen to the filmmakers commentaries. This box set comes with a new set of commentaries for each film, but its a bit annoying because they were recorded at a much lower volume than the original commentaries. The disc with the bonus features wasn't worthwhile IMO. The packaging of this set is more streamlined."
5,Blast from the past,"We were pleased when our Billy Jack 35th Anniversary Ultimate Collection arrived. It was promptly delivered and nicely packaged. We finally got to watch the first two from the set. Had a bit of a laugh over the styles and mannerisms of the day but it brought back memories of a passionate time in my life. I'm looking forward to watching ""Trial..."" and ""Billy Jack Goes to Wash..."" Glad we found this deal! Thanks!"
5,Billy Jack 35th Edition Collection,"If you are a fan of Billy Jack or even too young to know this serious. It is a must have. It has touched me in more ways than one. Personal, political, and most importantly spiritual.Thanks again Amazon for being my #1 store!Margaret Ann Seay"
4,billy jack 35th,This is the ultimate cult collection for those who know and love these movies a bit weak in spots tho the underlying theme of good vs evil with a white night scenario is great. Some people scoff at the scenario of the poor red man but these only hint at the never ending abuse of such by people who have the dont know dont care additude taken as a whole and reading a bit between the lines with an open mind expands ones own feelings of this kind of movie collection I have throughly enjoyed watching this series again to reflect and enjoy them
3,Looking Baack,"Everyone seems to look at ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"" as a radical & new statement when it was released. So many references to government blocking its release and all, but take a look at James Stewart inMr. Smith Goes to Washingtonreleased back in 1939. It is obvious where the the script came from as it is virtually identical. Not at all a new or revolutionary story. Other than that, I like the series. The movies take me back to a different time in our culture."
5,Billy Jack Movies,My husband and I have really been enjoying these movies. We grew up when they were new films and we both loved them then.....and now!
3,modlin1779,"Although this may be a terrific book, it does not belong in a category with serious books on atomic and hydrogen bombs. It will be of little value in writing a high school physics paper since it is about yo-yo tricks.Fortunately we bought one of the cheaper ones and it got here very quickly so there is still time to find something relevant to the subject matter."
5,You'll love it *IF* you don't expect more of the same,"I wrote this album off at first like most people have done. It sounds nothing like the first album and so I was disappointed -- at first. Then I listened to it again...and again...and again.When I listened closely to the lyrics and let the melodies sink in then it all became so utterly addictive. The lyrics are deep-felt, kind of painful and incredibly poetic and expressive. I guarantee that if you are having a sad streak or have just broken up with someone it will absolutely ring your psychological tuning fork. The lyrics have this weird effect of making you feel rock-out powerful while wallowing in emotional misery. Very strange.The recording and mix is full and lush, more mature, and has a more ""classic"" hard rock sound that will stand the test of time as opposed to their first album which had a decidedly contemporary sound.Pick this up and *really* listen to it."
1,What the hey hey?,"I don't know what to say except I'm am just really disapointed and disgusted... If you like this style of music try ""Phobia"" by Breaking Benjamin! It's the same style only the songs are MUCH stronger. Also, One-X by Three days grace is a strong release. I am simply disgusted..."
1,Major Dissapointment,I only liked one song and believe me I listened to the CD at least 5 times to make sure it was only the one song.I still listen to their first CD over and over and over...No comparison. Cold is still one of my all time favorite songs.I agree with many: What happened?
4,Give a few spins,"At first you may be a little disapointed but don't stop there. Good songs don't usually get you right away, atleast that is my opinion. This record is a little softer than the first, but the song writing is a little better. There is more style in the song writing.Peace!"
2,what a dissapointment!,"The follow-up to Crossfade's self-titled debut is...well, it just not as good. In fact, I hated this album. The only good songs are ""Already Gone"", ""Invincible"", and ""Drown You Out."" I tried to like the rest, I really did. But after listening to the album numerous times, I couldn't helping feeling like i wasted my money. I expected so much more from Crossfade. Seemingly all the songs have the same recurring theme (the word ""pain"" is used in several), and the tone of the songs just doesn't flow very well. Several songs have a number of different melodies, stopping and then starting again. It seems as if the band was experimenting and didn't know what kind of sound they were looking for, and the album suffers from it. BOTTOM LINE: borrow the album from a friend, then download the songs. Don't waste your money."
1,Crossfade has become CrossCRAP,"When I listen to this album, and then listen to their debut songs like ""No Giving Up"", ""Starless"", ""Cold"" ""Death Trend Setta"" I just cannot embrace this album at all. No, I personally don't believe its because the band lost a member. I think Crossfade is obviously one of those bands who without a record label breathing down their necks, makes this great debut album when just getting signed before they come in and tell them what to do. However, Crossfade to be is one of those bands who after getting popular and making some money, becomes lazy and puts this pitiful effort into their follow-up album. There is just something missing in this album, and I don't think I can think of the words to describe it but this album just isn't as catchy as the first one. ""Falling Away"", what an appropriate title for this album because if they keep this up, they will be ""falling away."""
2,What the hell happened? Big let down.,"I hate it when good bands go bad. I heard the 1st track on the radio a few days ago and said to myself is that Crossfade? Then sure enough it was I was like cool they have a new cd out. It's been out sence August ('06) and I didn't even know that should've clued me in but I figured it was Crossfade their last cd rocked this one should too, boy was I wrong. Washing the world away is the only song that kind of sounds like the pervious cd which I'm sure is why it was on the air. I'm majorly dissapointed the song Colors on the last cd was really awesome then they go and ruin it with some wussy crap, the air waves are already full of that. Maybe the next cd they'll go back to what made them and stop trying to be like everyone else."
2,Not what I expected,"After listening to this cd, I would say it's definetly not what I expected. We are all use to they're catchy head banging rock melody from the first cd, but in this cd I fell asleep just out of straight boredom just listening to the melody. Now the reason I gave them a two stars is maybe one or two songs that are decently good other than that I give 1 star to all the other songs. If you are looking for the band that has replaced Crossfade look up Evans Blue you won't be disappointed."
1,Not the same,"They will never be the same as they have lost Tony Byroads, the 2nd vocalist that did all the hooks in cold & colors, and their original drummer Brian Geiger isnt there anymore either, what made them Crossfade isnt there anymore"
1,Wow; they downright destroyed themselves by releasing this,"I thought this CD would be one listen at the library and then I would go buy it sometime. Wrongo! This release is nothing like the intelligent hard core slams of the self-titled album, the chord progressions are boring and the opening track is the only good one. This is definitely a disappointment; one of the worst releases of the year with certainty. Absolutely don't buy this if you liked the hits ""Cold"" and ""Colors"" from the other album, because no songs on here are like that."
2,"Without their DJ Tony Byroads, Crossfade reduced itself to a generic band...","Listening to this album had me almost convinced I was listening to 3 doors down, Papa Roach or even Dark New Day. But no, the album cover certified me that it was in deed Crossfade I was listening to...Tony Byroads added a unique sound to the band and without him, the band has lost their novelty. Too bad.It might still appeal to your ears if you just want an album that rocks, although you could probably get that from any other generic band. If you were looking for that particular sound produced in their first album, then you might be out of luck."
2,Sophomore slump defined,"OK, who kidnaped Crossfade and replaced them with this band? This is clearly not the group that gave us ""Cold"" and ""Disco"". Like many of the other reviews posted, I loved their debut album and was anxious for new material. Well... I guess you could say I'm STILL anxious for new material from Crossfade. Because clearly that's not who showed up in the studio to record this poor collection of material.After just a couple weeks of listening to it, trying my darndest to like it, I've pulled it from my iPod ""new music"" playlist. What a waste of money."
2,Disappointed,"I have been following this Band since they were under the Name of Sugar Daddy Superstar. If you are looking for a sound with an edge similar to Crossfade's AKA Sugar Daddy Superstar's first CD's you are out of luck and will be extremely disappointed! There are several songs worth listening too, but nothing that rocks nearly as hard as the first debut CD. This CD will not likely get any play on the harder rock stations. The Crossfade CD sounds more like another pop sell out like Nickelback. Crossfade has really lost the very original sound of their first CD.On the other there are several songs of honorable mention, Breathing slowly and Washing the world away. Even the more mellow songs have a different feel and sound to them. The more you listen to the CD the more it will grow on you.The loss of the back ground vocal sounds of the last CD is a huge loss. It has had a vast change to the Sound of Crossfade."
2,Falling Away Review,"I am sad to say Crossfade did not do a very good job with this album. Reasons I think why:1)They have a new member in the band2)Themes of songs on this album are more emo than anything3)Songs are repetitive and sound like each other. Unable to distinguish one from another.4)This album is a lot softer than Crossfade's self-titled first.""Crossfade"" was a lot harder, and contained more 'metal' influences.Overall, it's a disappointment to Crossfade fans, people who fell in love with their first album's sound. I sincerely hope this band will make more effort to make their third album a success."
1,Dissapointing,"I don't know any behind the scenes news of Crossfade or if the band changed between the 1st and 2nd albums, but after purchasing their 1st album I couldn't wait for the next. Well I pre-purchased on Amazon and was excited when I got Falling Away in the mail. Couldn't wait to listen. After listening to it I can't tell you how dissapointed I am. Who is this band? It sounds nothing like the first album. The song Someday starts off sounding ok then goes into ?????. I will have to preview all of the songs off any future Crossfade album before I purchase it."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?!,"I was horribly disappointed by this album. I've waited since 04 for a new album having high expectations especially after how awesome the first album was. There is absolutely no comparison between the albums. To be honest they might as well pull this album from shelves and rework their ""original magic"" because there new stuff isn't working and I'm sure others would agree. Crossfade will always be one of my favorite bands... but maybe they just had a bad year...."
2,What Happened to Crossfade??,"I guess with Big-T leaving the band obviously lost their rap, edge but is this really Crossfade on this new album. What happened to the ""hard rock"" in your face tracks like Death Trend Setta and No Giving Up that rocked with their mainstream stuff like Cold, So Far Away and Colors. All the songs are ballads and nothing appeals to me enough to crank the stereo and really get fired up to rock. I dont like invincible as their first single and really only like their new one Already Gone off the new CD. Overall very disappointed."
2,"Not the best, but a good try","Crossfade's ""Falling Away"" is an alright album. Not as good as their debut album though, but it a good effort. I am still a fan of Crossfade, but I think the band was better with Tony. No offence but I really dont like Mitch's vocals. It sounds like he is trying to hard, but with Tony the first album had a great flow to it and was really powerful and really great lyrics. I listened to all the songs through the 1st verse to the chorus and I hate to say most of the songs I was pretty disapointed with. The lyrics arent all that great and the music is not really at beat with the lyrics. There is only about 2 songs that are good, including ""Invincible"", and the other is Anchor, which the orginial is still better. I am not bad mouthing this album, but I know Crossfade could of done a lot better."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT,"Do not buy this product!!!! I ordered 2, and the company shipped them together via USPS, and charged me $20.00 to ship them. Both ripped as they were installed. The quality is horroible, and they constantly turn the Wii on and off, as the on/off buton is covered by silicon. Look for a different product by a different retailer!"
1,"Very flimsy, arrived ripped","The Wiimote cover arrived broken. It was ripped up one side of the cover. It came in an unsealed unmarked plastic bag, obviously repackaged. It looks like a factory defect since the holes for the Wiimote control buttons aren't even punched out of the silicone. The nunchuk glove was in usable condition, it just doesn't fit the nunchuk particularly well. It's very snug around the top part (where the controls are), as it should be, but around the base the cover isn't narrow enough so it is a very loose fit. As a result it just feels annoying holding the nunchuk with this glove on it. So I took it off after about an hour.I guess there is a reason why this cover set is so cheap."
1,"Won't Jump the ramp, no matter what.","More plastic junk, save your money. Can't believe I wasted more than $40 on this."
4,Level 42 returns to my CD player..,I discovered these guys at an HMV record store in London back in the late 80's and ended up buying everything they did. This one is pretty good; not up to the standards of World Machine and Guaranteed but not bad. If you are a serious Level 42 collector then by all means go for it.
3,It'd be good if it were advertized as a Mark King solo album,"To me, what makes Level 42 work is the contrast between the jazz/funk/tenor vocals of Mark King and the synth-pop/falsetto of Mike Lindup. Mike Lindup rejoined Level 42 after Retroglide was mostly done, although he does appear on it in spots. The result doesn't sound like a Level 42 album at all.I'm glad to hear the band's fully back together now, and I look forward to their next album, when Mike Lindup will be involved from the beginning."
5,GREAT COMEBACK ALBUM!!! WORTH EVERY PENNY,"Like many people, I was most disappointed with Forever Now but this band has put out so much great music in the past, that I figured I'd spend $30+ for the import and give them one more chance.Certainly worth every penny. The boys are back. Great lyrics, great vocals and guitar work."
2,"Some good songs, but....","The mix on this studio CD is thin and muddy, hardly state-of-the-art for 2006. Whoever mixed and mastered this CD needs to get the cotton out of their ears and join the 21st century. There's a live double-CD set from the Retroglide tour available via Mark King's web site. Get that one instead; you'll get terrific performances of five of the strongest tunes on Retroglide with greatly improved sound, plus a bunch of Level 42 classics."
2,Poorly Mixed or Mastered,"I'm a big fan of Level 42 and was very excited to see they had a new album out. I know they not as popular as they were, but couldn't figure out why it wasn't released here in the states. I know why now. The songs are standard Level 42 fare, but most of it is so poorly mixed/mastered I can see why it didn't get picked up over here. I loaded it into my ipod with anticipation, but as soon as ""Dive into the Sun"" started I thought maybe I had a setting wrong in iTunes when I imported it that compressed the hell out of it. (I've since listened directly from the CD and it sounds the same). Mark King's bass sounds muddy and without punch (as a bass player this was disappointing). There are no credits (that I could find) for mixing or mastering in the liner notes. Perhaps they mastered it themselves and threw the whole thing through a compressor (that's what it sounds like at least). Very disappointing."
4,balanced,"Ms Gutmann has done her research, it seems that she let her research dictate her conclusions, which in this subject area is not all that common. If this work had been done by Major Stephan Gutmann instead of Ms Stephanie Gutmann the book would have been attacked from another side. She seems to be able to see some of the contradictions in the ""politically correct"" answers to real questions, the world isn't always what we might hope it to be, but what we might like doesn't always change the reality that surrounds us. The fact that her work has already been cited in at least two articles from the most recent edition of Parameters (Army War College) leads one to hope that things still might change."
1,A Man's World,"Of course, in the WASP society we have no room for women, homosexuals, non-Protestants, and people of non-Anglo Saxon backgrounds - so why would we have room for them in the military? Hey, Ms Gutman - why don't you tackle the Veterans Administration next and take them apart since you are so thorough, so unbiased and so WASP in your assessments. There that is definite an organization for your time and talents. Review of your book - certainly, as a recently retired 25 year military combat veteran, I have one word ""PHEW!"" I've been with men that are totally worthless and women that I'd have on my team ANYDAY in ANY situation."
1,"Disgraceful, shameful and disrespectful","For the active duty servicemen AND women who proudly volunteered to defend and strengthen the USA, this book is a slap in the face to them. Like our President, if you haven't been in the military then don't persume to think that you can make any decisions or judgements about it. You were NOT akin to those who have made or are making the sacrifice to matter how many interviews you conduct or ""first hand"" reports you get. Ms Gutmann, you really have NO idea what you are talking about and your book should be burned with the trash."
3,Close-But No Cigar,"This book captures and documents the problems with integrating women into the military. Lower training standards and social problems resulting from a gender neutral approach are well presented.However, when the author begins highlighting restrictions on leave in foreign lands and higher standards of behavior as problems areas, she is off-base. A failure to understand the increased responsibility and visibility of military personnel and officers as ambassadors of the nation misrepresents improvements as a gender problems.There are plenty of problems associated with the new politically correct military that should not be marginalized by poorly made arguments. I began to believe that the author is really attempting to discredit real discussion on the gender neutral military by promoting socially irresponsible behavior my males."
4,"A fair, unbiased book","This book, written by a civilian, takes a look at the deterioration of the level of training performed in the armed forces. This book tells the effects of having women in positions that they are not ""up to par"". There are many women that can and do compete with their male counterparts, but most just don't match up. This book asks the questions- Are we ready for war? Will we win? As a US Marine, I have witnessed the difference in training the women are subjected to. Not only are the standards lower, they ARE treated differently, given more chances. I am a Fire Fighter in the Marines and I have personally witnessed the ""gentler"" way they are treated. They do have to complete the same objectives, but with more time and coaxing. This book is a real eye opener to anyone interested in the state of the military today. The fact that this book is written by a CIVILIAN WOMAN, makes it even more credible."
4,DISAPPOINTED NOW,"HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THESE MUFFINS BUT LATELY THEY HAVE GOTTEN SMALLER & SMALLER IN SIZE SO STOPPED BUYING....IF THEY RETURN TO NORMAL SIZE, WILL BUY AGAIN."
5,only the best for breakfast,"ya gotta try one or two or three. my mother never told me about Bays. Hmmm, what else do you suppose she never told me? THE BEST."
5,Toast to English Muffins,Enjoy this alternative to English muffins if you're on a wheat-free and gluten-free diet. They're tasty and crispy when toasted.
3,A nice little cd,"I was surprised by this. It is really a very nice cd. Good instrumental work, wonderful singing on most tracks. Very interesting, I would recommend it"
2,Utterly Useless - avoid this book at all costs.,"The GMAT CAT SuperCourse, 6th Edition by Thomas H. Martinson SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS. I encountered numerous typos in both the sample questions and answers. Furthermore, the questions in this book are nowhere similiar in style or difficulty to the questions found in ""The Official Guide for GMAT Review."" The hints and advices that Thomas Martinson offers are laughable and utterly useless. If you want a decent study guide for the GMAT exam, buy ""The Official Guide for GMAT Review"" and either a Kaplan or Princeton Review book. The GMAT CAT SuperCourse is an absolute waste of money!"
1,doesn't come with hanging equipment,"Well I got this chair to hang up on hook in the back yard. The chair comes with no accessory to hang up the chair. It kind of worthless with out it. This chair is a byer of maine chair. The chair has an accessory The SmartRope for hooking it up to a tree or other stout object. To find the accessory look for Byer of Maine Model A4020 "" SmartRope ""."
3,nutri cal,I was not happy with a 4.25 container of this running out in 2 days. the amount to give a large dog is 3-4 tbsp. This product needs to come in a larger amount.
1,Nutri-Cal Senior,I tried Nutri-Cal Senior. The product has the consistency of the caramel on a candied apple. My small dogs were unable to lick it out of the spoon or off the sides of a dish. It is totally worthless to me.
5,Nutrical review,"Great product for pets that don't get enough calories. My 23-year-old cat has a hard time getting enough calories since he's not terribly interested in his food anymore, but he loves this stuff!"
5,Nutri-Cal supplement for animals,I have been using Nutri-Cal supplement for animals for years and they really like it - both dogs and cats. It is especially good for the animals when you tend to feed them a lot of table food and for when they are sick. I provided some to a lady that rehabilitates injured birds and baby birds and she finds that the supplement helps the birds recover more quickly.
2,Senior cat,I purchased this product for my senior cat who needed to put on some weight following an illness. He hated the smell and taste. He would not eat it even when covered by food. I would not purchase this again.
3,Not a favorite,"We bought this because we have an 8 yr old cat that's been losing weight and are looking for a supplement to his diet. He liked it at first but now he's not interested at all. We have also tried a similar product by GNC that he just loves! If I mix the 2, he'll eat it but not on its own."
2,Talk button keeps breaking,"The phone came with a one year warrenty. At 13 months, the talk button on the handset broke. We could not make a call or answer a call using the handset. Called Uniden, but never could get through to customer service. Finally, we bought a replacement handset through Uniden... The handset had a 3 month warrenty. In the 4th month, the talk button on the new handset broke. We now have a fully functioning base unit and two handsets that don't work. This Uniden is heading toward the trash. My big question now is do I give any more of my $$ to Uniden. The reception on the unit was great. Very clear, but considering the cost of the phone, then adding [the money] for the replacement handset, I spent [a lot of money] to use a phone for 15 months !!"
1,Not happy with this product,"I purchased this phone/answering machine about 18 months ago. The sound quality is poor on the answering machine. I frequently have to replay messages to understand what the caller is saying. The number keys on the handset are placed in such a way that I often inadvertently hit them with my chin or mouth when talking on the phone. This produces that annoying beep in the ear of the person on the other end of the call. I'm also not impressed by the clarity of the sound on the phone. Recently, the number 7 button is sticking. Our area code begins with a 7, so it's been quite annoying. I called the repair area and it will cost me (dollar amount)to have it repaired. No thanks, I'll take my $(...)and buy a Sony. No more Unidens for me. To get one final complaint in on this product, the customer service reps were not very knowledgeable and not very friendly."
2,Disappointed,"I had to purchase one of these phones. I heard such good things about Uniden products in the past, and had high hopes for this one when I finally picked one up. Wow, how disappointed! I don't know what the quality of the sound was, what the range was, how long the battery lasts or anything. Because, after allowing the phone to charge for a full 27 hours, it would not work. When I would pick up the handset and press talk, there was no dial tone, although I received one throught the base unit (speakerphone). The phone had all the features I was looking for except for limited number memory (only 10). Too bad it was a lemon. I guess you should read reviews before you buy and not after. Good luck if you purchase one of these.I took the Uniden back and bought a Panasonic. Will let you know about that one soon."
1,Try another manufacturer,I purchased this phone around a month ago. The controls were clumsy. The memory dial functions would let me edit the text message but not the phone number. Thats simply stupid. The reception was ok but the clarity was worse than I would have expected. The final straw was that the answering machine would not successfully take the phone off hook. I would hear it pick on the 4th reing and hear the garbled prompt over a dialtone in the background. Callers would get 5 rings and then voicemail. I exchanged my unit for a new one and it acted the same. Uniden help was not helpful when I called during the day. Uniden was too busy at night and simply told me to call back and hung up. Try anything else. I'm simply glad I was able to return it for a refund.
4,"best so far, but still has a ways to go","so far i've tried the siemens gigaset, the panasonic 2570 and this phone. this is the best so far with a few qualifications.the sound of the phone was great, way better than the panasonic or siemens, and the distance was fine. this is the only one of the three phones that has a backup battery charger and can be used during a power outage. here's the down side; the speaker for the answering machine isn't so hot. it's not loud enough and it's not a real good quality sound. the phone has a dearth of features. there is no way to access the answering machine from the handset, there are only ten spaces for favorite numbers, there is no way to completely silence the ringer of the handset, no redial button, the belt clip is tiny and i doubt it would actually support the handset. i'm still going to look for something better. good luck!"
1,"Very good features, unreliable clarity","The caller ID and answering machine worked very well. The recorded voice was very clear and easy to understand and the caller ID worked fine. The reception was very spotty. At times, the phone worked flawlessly; however, on other occassions, the poor reception made the phone practically useless. The phone was affected by microwave ovens and florescent lights. In short, I am returning the phone."
3,Your prices are 20-40% higher than local retail,"Uniden,Motorola, and GE's older (black/blue w/antenna ringer light) are the best mid-priced phones. Look out for Columbia, Panasonic and V-Tech."
5,Fresh and Easy Every Day!,With each new recipe I try I am more grateful to Sarah Foster. She has created wonderful recipes that an everyday cook can master and feel proud. The cookbook is not only beautiful but also filled with helpful hints and twist on old standards. The addition of nutmeg in the banana muffins brings a depth and complexity I have yet to taste in this old stand-by treat. There are easy chicken dinners that can be on the table in no time and desserts that make everyday dinners feel like celebrations. This new cookbook sends many of my old ones out to pasture-making them feel dated and worn out.
4,This Is What They Eat in Heaven But Oh My Poor Eyes!,"First the good news: the recipes and photos are every bit as wonderful as those in Sara Foster's first cookbook. That is very high praise, as you know.We've had the book less than a week and we've made the Icebox Pickles, the Chipotle Mustard Sauce, the Chicken Salad with Apples, Grapes, And Spicy Pecans, and the Dark Chocolate Soufflé Cake. It's all so, so good!Sara Foster, I am your devoted fan and I will probably buy any cookbook you write. However, the layout on this one is terrible: small print and not much white space. For example, the ""WHAT TO SERVE WHEN"" section should have been separated from the intro paragraph, instead of just changing ink color. The binding should allow the page to lie flat - after all, it's a cookbook. The book is just plain hard to read and use.That said, I'm already waiting for the next Sara Foster cookbook!"
4,This one is a winner!,"I'm a cookbook junkie and in order to get my habit under control I've decided that before I commit to buying another cookbook, I will copy down one recipe that appeals to me and go home and see if it is yummy. I did that with the Apple and Avocado Salad with Lime and Mint-and it passed my test with flying colours!!It was refreshing and tasty with an original twist. Now I've purchased the book and everything I've made so far (three recipes)has been excellent. I also find the layout of this book fun-its packed with suggestions and information. I think both new cooks and experienced ones will enjoy using this book."
1,"Does not work with Vista, Windows 7","Bought this scanner new, just before Vista came out. Scanner itself works fine under Windows XP. Mostly used it for text and emailing printed photos. However, HP has never released drivers for it under Vista or Windows 7. It was a pain, but I was able to keep an XP computer nearby. Now that my last XP computer is gone, the scanner is now useless even though it is in perfect condition and is just right for home use. Do an internet search for 'scanjet 4400 driver' for more detail. Bottom line is HP may think they will sell more by not supporting their products, but it's the last HP I'll purchase. (And their calculators and test equipment used to be the best out there!)"
1,Do NOT buy this awful book.,"As an aspiring screenwriter, I have devoured most of the commonly read texts currently available on the topic. Halperin's book does _not_ stand up favorably. In fact, not only is his writing style stilted and vague (e.g., non-specific use of ""it"" and ""they"", and more dumped quotes than you can shake your mouse at), his ideas are nothing more than lame banalities. For more info on writing pick up any of Syd Field's books, and for info on psychology any basic primer will do. His examples are not illustrative and his film analysis is at the middle-school level. Don't waste your money on this book like I did."
1,Don't bother,You might find this book interesting if you've never read another book on screenwriting or human behavior. If you've read any of the other books in the field you will find this one inferior. Linda Seger's books on characterization are much better. I'm only glad I bought this title used from Amazon.com -- and I waited to sell it before I posted this review.
2,Outdated and Simplistic,"This is the first time I have been compelled to write a review but rarely have I found it difficult to salvage even a single piece of useful information from a book. I was astounded to find out this book was written in 2005, given it''s outdated and borderline misogynistic references. It is pretty easy to provide great answers to questions when you are free to create any story that is convenient, but most of those answers are neither practical nor realistic for the average candidate. Definitely not worth the money."
2,"Content good, product bad","As the title indicates, the content of the book is pretty solid - it's useful, and even though there don't seem to be enough examples to address each ""issue"", she'll often break down a technique to explain why it works. I would have given this book 4 stars, now I'd rather give it 2 1/2 rather than 3BUTNot only are there all kinds of misspelled words and grammatical errors, but about 30% into the book, at least the kindle version, the ""why this technique works"" sections appear to be addressing completely different material. I don't know if the text is jumbled or bits ere deleted or WHAT, and who knows whose fault it is, but I am definitely not getting my money's worth.Like I said the material is good, but the execution of the product that was delivered to my Kindle was terrible. I have no way of knowing if the fault is the author's, but I can't trust someone who creates a faulty product."
1,Not very helpful,I di dnot find the questions and answers listed in this book to be very helpful for the average Joe job seeker.
3,Answers for Sales positions,This book contains all the questions that are asked during interviews. But the answers seem to focus only on the sales position. You have to adapt those answers to your personal situation. This is not easy. The author should revise his book and adapt the answers to all situations.
5,A MUST READ FOR YOUNG PROFESSIONALS,"Vicky Oliver's advice, from strategies to help navigate conversations and interactions throughout the interview process, and her reminders about small details that most candidates overlook in preparing for interviews, helped me land a job at a top firm in finance during a very competitive environment.Vicky's one-on-one consultation gave me the confidence to make an excellent first impression, the tools to navigate my way through 3 rounds of interviews, and helped land me an offer!Young Professionals: Buy the book and equip yourselves with Vicky's advice before heading into interviews! In this market, you need to be prepared as to how to manage your interview process and how to get the job you want!"
5,Phenomenal,"Ms. Oliver has written a genuinely insightful and helpful guide for job seekers everywhere. Her approach is to arm candidates with the responses they can give interviewers that will lead to call-back appointments and live offers. Beyond that, her book is actually a lively and engaging read. She's truly a job hunter's friend in need."
1,Absolute waste of time & money...,"...unless you are Vicky Oliver from the past, who would benefit immensely from this book. Everybody else - don't bother. With answers that retell what Vicky Oliver said in an interview to the dot, including names of people, products and companies she's worked at; with little to no comments or advice that would apply anywhere else, do yourself a favor, and invest the money elsewhere. I have never in my life regretted buying a book before... The joke's on me though."
3,Some silly answers,"The book has some suggested answers that I would be embarrassed to deliver. To quote one:Question: ""So, basically, you've been unemployed for two years. Why should I hire you?""Suggested Answer: ""I'm delighted you brought that up, Eileen. When I was let go from DDL, I took the opportunity to reinvent myself...""And it goes on from there.For what it's worth, there's some good questions in the book that should be considered ahead of time, but I wouldn't recommend taking the suggested responses too seriously."
5,Best New Job Hunters Guide!,"This is the best new job hunters book to come out in years! Vicky Oliver's answers are smart, insightful and will help any one get prepared for those interview questions that can take you by surprise. All college grads should be issued this book with their diplomas!"
1,poor to useless interview suggestions,"I found this book to be poor to practically worthless. Its suggested answers were NOT helpful, and were seen as being ""cutesy"" and/or ""smart-ass"". A big waste of my money and time. I do NOT recommend it. I'd have given it zero stars if I could."
5,Essential Resource for All Interviewees,"301 Smart Answers... is a book to keep in mind when getting or leaving a job. It is a practical guide through the toughest questions of any interview. The format is clear and concise. The question is asked, the best answer is presented, and then the rationale behind the answer is explained in the ""why this technique works"" section. The author covers all kinds of situations, but doesn't waste time on long-winded explanations. Instead, she provides useful insight and advice on what to keep in mind throughout the interview process. Sidebars scattered throughout the book are useful for general tips. The appendix provides a decent list of useful websites. This is a direct and useful reference for anyone in the job market."
2,Not what the title says,"This book does give you a good idea on many normal questions. The problem is that more than half the questions that are used in this book are either illegal or questionable. Ones such as how would you handle a tough workplace situation are not answered.There is also a strong female bent, with questions about working with or planning a family, again questions which border on being against labor law.I did learn some things from this book, but I would say 20% of the book was relevant to me."
5,Timless Resource on Job Interviews,"It's surprising how many ""awkward"" issues can come up in job interviews--from a less-than-stellar job history to sketchy references to personal stuff like health issues. As a mentor for a young person who had a number of such issues, I was happy to find, read, and recommend Vicky Oliver's book. She leaves no stone unturned in this comprehensive guide to interviewing. I'm certain it's going to be enormously helpful. Vicky is completely accessible as well. You can email her with questions. First rate on all counts."
4,I like it !!!!!,"I like it very much.It is a practical book, it helped me to find a job and to pass several interviews.Thank you."
5,Perfect interview reference.,This book helped me answer all my questions I had. If had lots of information about interviews and what to expect. Using this book and www.JobInterviewQuestions.us I was able to prepare for my interview and get the job!Thanks so much.
4,Good for people with acne scars,"Although I've only used this product twice, I have not had immediate results yet. It's worth buying because the mask is so soothing on my face.I know it is working because of the activation of the cooling sensation. ****Don't follow the directions on the package**** Just put a half-dollar size amount with a little water. The package has enough for about 4 mask treatments."
4,Classic Poirot - but I caught on to the murderer,"I liked this one a lot, but I did catch on to who the murderer was by the end. So either I'm getting better at this, or Christie was weaker - you be the judge! It is definitely classic Poirot and a must read for Christie fans."
3,"Not all ""the early stuff"" is good","Don't waste your time with this album. It doesn't even sound like Joe singing. GetDon't Back Down, orLove Songs for the Retardedinstead. Or if you really want this album, you can have my copy..."
4,thank god for queers!,"This album is a lot like ""A Day Late And A Dollar Short"" or ""Beyond The Valley"". Hard punk, less pop. Loud, fast and lacking of smooth studio polish. The way punk should be. I can't make out one word in ""Junk Freak"", but it's one of my favorite Queer's songs ever. And ""Boobarella"" and ""Gay Boy"" give this album the strong abbrasive political incorrectness that Joe King is the master of. BUY THIS ALBUM!"
5,THE BEAT GOES ON!,"This CD is the best! It has Great lyrics and is defenitly worth buying! Where else could you find lyrics like "" I met her at the rat""? This CD deserves to be bought and played over and over, even if your not a big punk,ska,oi fan this CD will convince you to be one!"
1,Junk,First of all the content on the CD is not resuable in anyway. It comes with a semi-functional interactive CD that will allow you to print patterns but they are all locked Flash files so you can not use them in illustrator or in any other program.The book itself is page after page of repeated patterns with slight color adjustment. The patterns are uninspired and dated. I would not recommend this book to anyone if I could give it negative stars i would.
1,Wasted Purchase,"I have to share the same sentiments with a few of the other reviewers. Typically, when a CD-ROM comes with a book of this nature, one would expect the visual content (in this case the patterns displayed in this book) to be available on the disc itself. Not the case here, which I thought was a bit deceiving. It would have been much smarter (and more practical for the end user) for the book author to have provided the patterns as EPS files for use in a vector based software application such as Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw. Otherwise what good is it to look at these patterns when you can't easily recreate them?"
4,Typical Wilson :-),"This is like Prometheus Rising for a group setting. If you enjoy Wilson's writing then get the book, if you have a bunch of pals who will get together to do the exercises buy the book. I really have no gripe save one my wife has. You need a dictionary handy. He does not dumb down his works and unless you are a wiz with word meanings and history you will be looking stuff up. I like it though."
5,Psychologist gives 2 thumbs up,"Is there any such thing as reality? Wilson focuses on the counter-intuitive concept that our own delicate mental machinery is all we really have to create ""reality"". Not a new idea - the phenomenologists have been writing about it for a century - but this book makes a nice bridge between science and the ""touchy feely"" world of personal psychological experience. Excellent for that engineer on your gift list, who ""just doesn't get"" things psychological."
5,Core Reading,"May be the best of Wilson's book for summing up his version of how the mind works. An excellent integration of diverse sciences, complete with many experiments you can do yourself. Also try Prometheus Rising, and Coincidance."
2,Why Don't They Just QUIT?,Was a bit slow. Did have some good information but still very dry I thought. I do use if for educational services.
2,C+ At Best,"I, too, purchased this to use with my patients in early recovery, an ethnically mixed urban/suburban population who complain that their families, friends,s.o.'s ""don't get it"". If you are purchasing this to INFORM for the first time about substance abuse and why it is difficult to ""just quit"", please choose another way. This is overly long, meanders, imparts very little useful information, and lacks energy (I'm a therapist and it put ME to sleep). I don't think it would find a connection with an audience that is hungry for ""ah-hah"" moments and some insights into their loved one's problem. It is basically four people (all middle aged Caucasians) sitting in a darkened room around a table asking each other what they think about a range of topics. It could have been great--personal stories, professional insights, some science, etc., but kind of comes across as a sleepy, low budget afternoon interview show. I will keep looking."
1,"If you are a professional, don't bother!","I purchased this DVD with the plan that it might be useful with families of individuals in treatment. Well, it is all talk, and so shallow as to be not useful at all with this population. I am not sure what I would use it for at all. Don't waste your money."
5,1st indian kids book made by a real pal,"This book is about Ragini&Malini siriguri Singing Poems I reviewed The Autorickshaw blues and it is the (BEST)book in town,kinda started with my family,everybody got to read it,its bestest book in the universe"
5,Great help for teachers needing comprehension strategy lessons!,This book helps teachers find lessons already laid out for instruction to focus on specific comprehension strategies their students may need. Good examples and additional resources are included.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this dvd. I found there was too much Vinyasa Yoga and not nearly enough Qi Gong. In addition, the yoga was boring and overly repetitive. If you are looking for a good vinyasa dvd, Seane Corne's dvd is fantastic. I guess I'll be sticking to separate Qi Gong and Yoga practices until I can write my own combination."
1,"great ego, poor lecture","This lecture starts off cautioning the viewer not to watch it unless you've already written and polished five screenplays. But its not you, the audience, who needs help here. The lecture is highly fragmented (bouncing from psychoanalysis to bits of theory to movie titles); disorganization cannot be confused with erudite. Speaking quickly does not indicate that there is a lot to say, either. Basically, it comes down to: the theme comes out of the dilemma, and if you do not qualify to sit in my presence -- don't."
2,"The mask is amazing, the service is terrible","First, about the product. The mask really works, it leaves skin smooth, hidrated e.t.c (read Amazon's review). I have a dull skin, and this mask gave me some blush and freshness for 2-3 days. BUT... the service is definetely bad. I've odered from this seller 3 times. First two packages I supposed to pick up at the post office and pay around $1 for additional postmarks or smth like that. And I've paid for delivery at check out!!! The third time I got 3(!) wrong masks from 5 I've odered. I'm not gonna send them back, too much headache, but I probably find the similar product from another seller. Too bad. I loved these masks."
5,Oster Blender Blade Purchase,"I have an Oster blender that I really like but the blades seized up, so I went online to look for new blades. Goodman's website in Miami, Florida took my eye. Their website was informative and had a good picture of the blades and description so I knew I was ordering the right thing, and the price was reasonable. They processed my order quickly and I had the blades about a week later. They were brand new in a box and they have been working great. I was very pleased with the experience I had with them."
5,Ice crusher blender blade,"This product was Oster's original equitment for my blender and at a better price than on Osters web site. I ordered two, one to have as a spare account of paying for shipment was more than the product, and why not for the price. The product was shipped on time with no problems and works as well as the original equipment. I would highly suggest this product and shipper to all in need of this Oster replacemnt part."
5,This worked.,"We had an original bee-hive Oster blender inherited from my M.I.L. until the motor died. We bought a new one, but it began to leak after a year or so. We almost tossed it but found this replacement part for the base of the leaky blender container. Unscrewed & tossed out the old base, screwed on the new one, & ta da--it works again, no leaks. Good investment of under $10."
3,Review of ice crusher blender blade cutter for Oster & Osterizer,"This is now the 3rd blade for my blender. The bearings just give out over time and freeze up. It's not a problem with the manufacturer (this is now the 3rd different manufacturer), apparently it's a general design flaw of the oster/osterizer blender blade. Having said that, I've just received this particular blade a few weeks ago. No problems this far, but i figure it will fail like the other two in about the next two years."
5,Restored my 4 year old blender to new condition!,"It's been 4 weeks and no problems at all. This (appears) to be a highly quality, OEM product just as described. Does a great job standard blending and ice crushing (as it should). Highly recommended to others. Note: when cleaning blender, be careful because the blades do point upward more than the non-ice crusher original. You'll know what I mean after you point yourself in the finger, but only takes once to learn."
4,It does what it's supposed to do,I bought this to replace a normal blade that had worn out. I use the ice crusher blade primarily for smoothies and it works well. I generally don't use ice so it's only had to work on frozen fruit. I'm interested to see how well it does with normal blending.
4,The whole blender,Best blender ever. It is like the shuttle taking off and these blades handle just about anything. I bought a backup blade but I hope I never have to use it. So far so good.
4,Excellent accessory,This blade works very well. Mine was getting a bit dull so this was a welcomed replacement. We make a lot of smoothie drinks and the ice would eventually dull any blade.
5,Ice Crusher for Oster,"Of course, this blade is exactly what it says it is. It was delivered quickly and in the original box in perfect condition."
1,Beware! Not as pictured. Rusts.,"The first time I washed this blade in the dishwasher, the rivet in the center rusted, a lot. The rivet in the center does not look the same as in the picture. I cannot use this blade because the rust will go into my smoothies. It is not worth taking the time and trouble to return it, so I'll just toss it. The seller should mention in the description that the rivet is not made of stainless steel, so care must be taken to prevent rust."
1,Very cheaply made,"I have had my Oster blender for about 40 years and it still runs great. The problem is that it leaks at the base, even after replacing the washer. So, I ordered this blade which obviously isn't original equipment. The problem with it is that it does not turn freely, in fact, it's so hard to turn I'm afraid it will put a strain on the motor. I am requesting a refund."
5,Repeat customer,"I love these candles and scented oil. I have ordered multiple times from this site and will continue to do so. Everyone comments when they come into my house ""what is that fragrance; I love it!"""
2,"""Little"" Is The Key Word Here","This book is very small, so the word ""little"" in the title is completely accurate. The book is not utterly wretched, but has no new information, and is not comprehensive in any significant way. (Again, it is little.) The illustrations are the books strong point; they are not especially lurid, but are adequate to illustrating the author's points. The problem with them is that for every four or five points needing illustration, there are one or two photographs. The photographs themselves are in color and have good color registry.If you are in a long-term relationship and are looking for something new to spice up your romantic life, this book is not for you. For content it is pretty low scoring, but the one exception is the last chapter ""Health Matters,"" which is largely common sense, but nonetheless spells out some important health and safety considerations, a few of which are less obvious than others."
2,Its alright...,"I was expecting a little more from this book. It basically just gives a quick overview on the issues. For general information this book would be alright, but there are books out there that are much more informative."
4,just a lil more,"the book had thing i already knew, but it was just n a different plain. stuff like bondage and other new way to keep him and my self happy was very good and effective."
2,Brita Aquaview,We have very hard water here in Colorado and the Brita Aquaview attempts wothout much luch to remove the taste ofthe impurites.
1,Amazon Lies!,"I ordered this item based on the picture Amazon shows. When it was delivered it turned out to be the smaller, cheaper version of the Brita filter. DO NOT trust Amazon photos of products. The price I paid should have been the upgraded model. Amazon will NOT help you with the return of an item supplied by a vendor they are apparently associated with. That is no way to treat customers!"
5,NOW THAT'S GOOD WATER!!!,I JUST RECEIVED MINE THIS AFTERNOON AND IT TOOK MY BOYFRIEND LESS THAN 5 MINUTES TO INSTALL AND WAS SO EASY THAT I COULD HAVE DONE IT. WE NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TASTE OF OUR WATER ALREADY AND ARE HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT. I WILL DEFINITELY DRINK MORE TAP WATER AND THROW AWAY THE PITCHER NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS FILTER. NEW YORK WATER TASTES LIKE A SWIMMING POOL AND THIS MAKES DRINKING IT SO MUCH BETTER! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BRITA FILTER SYSTEM.
3,"Great product,BUT no filters avalable",Ok the faucet mout filter is great i loveit i had the old on tap and did not like it cause it stuck out this one hide underneath and behind which is great until you have replace the filter and the only place i have found that has them is amazon and you have to pay shipping which really sucks
4,Probably user error,"I have had the Brita Aqua view for around three years now. And the only time I have ever had any complaint other than the replacement indicator not seeming terribly accurate, was when I accidentally ran hot water through the filter. HOT WATER WILL RUIN THE FILTER!! At somewhere between 15 to 20 dollars per filter, it's a mistake I only made once. The filters have a good life span aside from that. I have been very pleased with the quality and taste of the filtered product. And 2 of my years with it were in Atlanta, where the water is notoriously bad.And how many other on tap water filters offer a sprayer option? I use that feature almost exclusively, I believe it cuts water usage when rinsing dishes by about 30%. That alone puts it a step above. If used properly I think the Aqua View is as good or better than any other available."
2,costly,"looks nice, works but is costly over the long run. I had a lot of problems as the water where I live is not the greatest and filters never lived up to the advertised number of gallons.sears has a system that is rated higher by consumer reports and filters are less expensive per gallon."
4,Great filter: Just put on an extra rubber washer!,"For all you people out there who have a hard time stopping a Brita filter system from leaking, just pop out the washer from the original aearator that you just unscrewed to install the Brita in the first place and add it on top of the Brita washer! Then just reinstall it! It's just that simple!"
4,Works great!,The Aquaview 42645 by Britta was a snap to install and it is working with no problems so far.
1,water still tasted like chlorine ... started to drip,I wanted to buy something that would remove the taste of chlorine from the kitchen faucet but even with the Brita it still tasted like chlorine. After about 2 weeks it started to drip from the where the Brita screws into the faucet. So now you don't have filtered water. My husband replaced washer and it still dripped. If you accidently put the hot water on while someone in the house just before used the filtered part the filter is ruined.
3,Brita faucet filter,"Tastes better than straight tapwater, more like spring water now, but still not very good tasting. It works fine, but with Anaheim tap water, it's just not enough."
1,Cumbersome gimmick rip-off,"I moved into a place where my roommate had this on the faucet. Compared to Brita's ""On Tap"" solution, this thing is cumbersome and bulky. Then I go to buy replacement filters for it, and find that despite filtering the same amount of water (100 gallons), the Aquaview filters cost twice as much! For the same price, I'm buying a new ""On Tap"" system and saving big time on future replacement filters."
1,crappy,This worked great for about two weeks of minimal use. I live in New York and I don't believe I got more than 5 gallons of water before the filter stopped working completely. Definately not worth the money.
4,Nicely designed water filter,I have purchased two of these filters. I really like the design. It's great that it fits under the faucet head instead of sticking up. I like the three types of water sprays. We used the filtered spray for drinking. The shower-type spray for washing dishes and the pour spray for filling bottles. It filters nicely.The only drawbacks are that for whatever reason we've had some trouble getting a nice seal. Originally it did seal well to the faucet and I think the problem is mostly likely with my own faucet and not the Brita filter.
4,Good filter for kitchen sink tap,"This is a good water filter for the kitchen sink tap. The knob provides 3 settings, Brita filtered water, shower, or plain. I like the shower setting for washing dishes etc. The horizontal design provides a low hieght filter so does not obstruct the sink."
4,It is fantastic!,"It is a good video to watch whenever anyone needs a bit of clarity in director, what-to-do-next, support and encouragement. She is great!"
1,Completly Worthless - Nothing to do with XHTML,"This book is completely worthless regarding XHTML. The author is just plugging a buzzword here to sell a book (that's not even interesting) about HTML 4.0. Matter of fact, one of the first things you read in the readme file is:""1) Open up Netscape Navigator""Now as far as I know Netscape doesn't understand XML, much less Namespaces and is completely unable to do ANY XHTML.This was a very good joke till it last, but as it is, I'm returning the book. As far as the HTML tutorial use of this book, we are taught how to do ""complex tables"" which for the author is equivalent to defining the width of the table's columns. No way!This was very, very disappointing."
2,There's more meat to it than this,"Ouch -- when a book starts with ""What the heck is XHTML?"" and the answer is (in part) ""a subset of XML"", you hope things will improve from there, but unfortunately this book doesn't make it.Positioned as ""fast and easy"", the book does tend to gloss over important details in the interest of getting pages put together quickly, or by going for the cute one-liners (Tag! You're it!).Using images for navigation, a very basic concept, isn't covered until chapter 13, yet the reader has already been introduced to tables and frames.There's meatier books out there without going overboard into ""advanced"" reader levels; find one of those instead."
5,delicous and healthy,"i love everything about g'day gourmet products...healthy omega-3s, minimal mercury, wild-caught, packed with flavor (no mayo needed) and so convenient. tomato basil and indian curry are my favorites. easy to add to salads, in a sandwich, or atop of a cracker. delicious and a perfect punch of healthy protein! The skipjack tuna used in gg's products has less mercury than albacore....and in the tomato basil, I can totally taste the basil (unlike one of the reviewers)!"
3,dissappointed,"#1 my mistake -Unfortunately I did not realize that this was not Albacore tuna until I opened a can - at this price I expected it to be - small 3.5 oz can - my assumption was that it would taste more like a Italian Albacore tuna ""gourmet"" with more of a tomato sauceTuna was comparable to any off the shelf tuna in UStomato taste slightand basil ?taught me never to order unless I know the product"
1,Another waste of time,"Gee could this be Asylum's version of Halloween? Wow, guestar57 liked another Asylum production. Read the reviews and after watching any single Asylum movie you will know they make Troma look like Paramount!"
1,As bad as it gets,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in any genre! The acting is so bad that these people can't even pull off a McDonald's commercial! Even worse, is that the story is not even based on actual events. The actors can't even die well, meaning if you enjoy gore this thing will just put you to sleep. The obligitory lesbian scenes are overused to the point of being boring as well. I spent almost $5.00 at Blockbuster for this DVD rental, while it should be $3.00 to own, if you really want to waste the 1.20 mins. to watch it. If the makers took their time just a bit,it may have been a decent story, as it does show some promise with the Halloween party prank(which is the subplot),but it falls short as being a direct to video, and tries to borrow too much fromm other worthy classics."
2,Very funny,"The movie is definitely entertaining on a cheesy level, the bad acting, boobs, and cheap gore scenes make this movie a definite low-budget B movie. Only reason I kind of enjoyed it is that my bands songs were used through out the movie and all through the credits. If you are into all of the above, you'll love it!"
4,It's a pretty good book,It's a pretty good book! I liked it because it had tips on how to meet a superstar. I got it as a gift for my little sister and I ended up keeping it and buying her a new one! It just is like the how to plan a party book you can write info in it about who you wanna meet and things like that.
3,Cute but unrealistic,"A pretty cute book, very unrealistic (especially Michelle sneaking in the dressing room and convincing the stars to come to her shcool) but it's written in a cute way. Not my favorite book in the Full House Michelle series, but not the worst either."
5,KREG POCKET HOLE JIG,"The jig was simple to install, easy to use and msde perfect pocket holes every time, right from the first hole. I had never made a pocket hole before."
5,"Very, Very, Very, essential Bauhaus................Very!","Bauhaus offers more than six cuts, however i think is a good basic Bauhaus 101 for begginers, if you want to enter into 80s good Gothic (because theres a lot of bad gothic)The Singles 1981-1983 from Peter Murphys most influential band, is an album for you remake of Bowies ""Ziggy Stardust"" will leave yuor mind blowing away, theres no chance you feel regret after taste this albumHM"
1,"For Veterinarians, not humans!","I purchased this only to find that the bottle says this product is for Veterinarians, not humans. A piece of useful information that should have been included in the description above..."
3,Too much to ask for Universal to keep packaging consistent?,"The show is great, and I'm glad it's being released on DVD? But, it is so inconsistent with the packaging. Can't they stick with one package idea, so that all the seasons will look like they belong together on a DVD shelf? Seasons 1 & 2 came in the parkas with the zipper. Season 3 came in a cardboard box where the opening for the 3 slim-cases serves as the spine. Now Season 4 is in a cardboard box, backwards from Season 3. It has a Northern Exposure title on the spine, on the opposite side of the opening. Season 3 didn't have that. It's hard to explain. Just buy Seasons 3&4 and you'll see what I mean. There's no way to put them on a shelf next to each other and have them match."
5,I love the packaging,"It's funny, people loved NX for it's uniqueness, but complain about the (I think) cool parka packs. They could package it just like everybody else, maybe the people in charge like to think outside the -BOX-......NX makes me want to move back to the small town i grew up in, or one like it. Love 1-3, can't wait for 4."
2,Big Hit or Big Miss,"Depending on how you feel about the role of music in Northern Exposure, this collection is either a Big Hit or a Big Miss for you. Universal has completely and utterly given up on even trying to provide meaningful music for these episodes, let alone the songs originally aired. In some places, they've picked out the sappiest, most irritating music sitting around in the archives.If you are drawn to the characters and stories, you'll enjoy these episodes. I've been moved by the stories, I'm drawn into the character's lives, and I have thoroughly enjoyed returning to this program. The music is very important to me, but the stories more so. I'm resigned to living without.But if the music made this show for you, don't buy this product. Your heart will be broken and you'll feel sorry for these characters being so completely disrespected living life to such extraordinarily aweful music.This is a one if the music matters, a four if it doesn't."
4,The music used on this show,"The music replacements being used on this show isn't the fault of the copyright holders. No, no, no, it is universal studios wanting to save a little money. Some of the original songs that are suppose to be on the second and third season sets are not there but somehow are on the fourth season sets and vice versa. That's universal being greedy! I taped every episode from A&E and they did not replace any of the original music. I compare the two. Universal could have left everything alone and put these's dvd's out just like hbo has done with the sopranos. It would have cost us more than the $59.99 retail price, like say, $79.99, but i'll just bet that any fan of this classic series would have paid that!"
2,wont buy until original music put back in,"NX had as one of its' signatures a song at the end that captured the emotional and sentimental nature of each episode. The one that stick's out most dramatically in my mind (and one of the things that always reminds me of the show) is Hendrix's Hey Joe. I'm always surprised that the rights to the music are not locked-up from the start given the ""after market"" is so huge for these shows, even prior to DVD releases the rerun/sindication value was always significant.I remember being very disappointed when Thirtysomething had a brief rerun life and the music was not original (particularly a Rolling Stones song, and maybe a Joni Mitchell song were replaced by some really bad music). I was happy to hear that Thirtysomething was released on DVD after the music rights issue had been resolved."
2,NEx Season 4 headache,"Trying to save a buck, the manufactures of this set have released season 4 on double-sided DVDs, instead of on higher-quality single-sided ones. I can't play the B-side episodes on my DVD player, my mac laptop, nor on my friend's DVD player. Thanks for being cheap. (The other Northern Exposure series' DVDs I have received have been fine.) The episodes I CAN watch (A-side) are great, but that's hardly a consolation."
5,Great season!,"Season 4 is right on par with the first three seasons. Newbie Mike Monroe (Anthony Edwards) adds a refreshing change in the dynamics between all the characters. He blends in seemlessly and, although his circumstance is a bit bizaar, you quickly forget (as does he, it seems) his malady. A great addition to the cast.Some real gems in this season. A season no NoEx fan should miss. Entertaining for the newcomer but my advice is start from the beginning of the series. You'll gain a greater appreciation for the characters. Writing on season 4 is top notch!!! This show was one of a kind and unfortunately, I haven't seen anything with it's down hominess, humor, social consciousness, intelligence and flat out great writing since. One of TV's great series!"
1,The dream is over,"This season really is a let down after the peak of Season 3. There is barely a sighting of Adam, who has become a parody of himself and Chris: Would you shut up for a minute? Sure it has its moments but they are few and far between. The restraint the writers used in characterisation is gone."
3,What happened?!?!??!,"By far my favorite season of my favorite show has been all but ruined by the corruption of the soundtrack!! Instead of the very original and eclectic music offered in the original (on the soundtracks which I own), most of it has been replaced by this hellacious twangy, depressing country music that makes the show painful instead of enjoyable to watch. It's like one of the original main characters has been killed off and replaced with ""new Coke"". The series deserves 5 stars, the changed soundtrack damages the series to a point of 3 stars or less. Why did they change something so perfect????"
3,Universal... When are they going to get it right with the MUSIC?,"How do you change a five-star rating into a three-star? Try releasing a set of DVDs with some ""slight"" revisions from the way the show originally aired. Granted, they didn't change any storylines. That would be unforgivable.I, unlike some of the other reviewers, am not as forgiving when comes to the missing original music. The music was an integral part of the show... setting a mood or punctuating an event. Watching Tooley's ""burial"" in ""Heroes"" and not hearing Procol Harem's ""A Lighter Shade of Pale"" or the missing ""Turn! Turn! Turn"" in the final scene of the ""Old Tree"" really alters the mood. Then, what Universal puts in their place... where's that coming from? After all, this is NX not ""Ed"" or the ""Gilmore Girls""!Is it copyright and/or royalty issues, or just profits?"
2,Northern exposure 4th Season,Disc one had some type of video error on episode 2 and 3 right out of the package. Wrote to Amazon and they never replied. Otherwise enjoyed the series.
5,For grandpa,Came in a timely manner. Grandpa loves this series and is always happy to get a new season of it.
2,Northern Exposure dvd's 4th season,"A while ago I purchased the entire series of DVD's of Northern Exposure. Most of them are all right, but some of them are defective and break up into little squares when you try to view them. They simply cannot be viewed. They were all new and unused. This is very disappointing. So far the only problem seems to be with the 4th season. They were not all purchased from the same source and I no longer have the paperwork. Any suggestions?"
1,I WISH I COULD VIEW ALL OF IT,"This may be the best season, EXCEPT I cannot view it all because of the damaged condition of DVD's when arrived. They will not play all way through. The DVD's were all loose inside box set and were gouged, scratched and marked. I would like an exchange but it seems to be impossible to do. I went through all the screens to try to get a replacement, but don't seem to be allowed to do so even though they arrive last week (3/6/12) The rest of order was fine. this is the ONLY problem I have encountered with Amazon orders. All others have been quick and undamaged."
1,Music makes a difference,"I honestly don't understand the legal issues with song licensing that are at stake with these DVDs. Clearly, they could legally use the songs in the originally aired episodes, so why they cannot be included on the DVD version seems odd to me. But so be it.I continue to live without my beloved Northern Exposure (except season 1, which conspicuously remained intact...) because of this omission.Oh, and packaging complaints aren't worth mentioning, even in passing. Content is the only worthwhile aspect to review about these. If only that content were truly complete..."
5,A fix for music junkies,"There are a lot of complaints on here about music, so I thought I'd comment. First off I liked the music too, but hey you gotta take what you can get (the new or no music doesnt ruin the show).But....there are now other NX DVD's out there. Just do a google on ""Northern Exposure DVD"" and it will be one of the top results. They claim ""All DVDs are presented in full screen, commercial free and unedited. Exactly the same as it was shown in American television.""I am not promoting these DVD's, or the company that sells them as I have only purchased seasons 1-4 from Amazon."
4,"Best Show Ever, At Its Best!","Nothing more to say, as the writing speaks for itself. Actors are all great also, but the writers deserve much more than an Emmy. One minute I am laughing out loud, the next I'm evaluating my faith...no show has done that before or since.I won't beat a dead horse, but all that is missing is the music. Which brings me to a question: Amazon has a link to a site called TVDVD Planet which supposedly sells all 110 episodes from all 6 seasons with orginal music in one box set for a hefty price. First, has anyone purchased these through this site? I didn't think they were available? Do they really have all the orginal music and episodes, etc? Just curious. Why doesn't Amazon sell these?Anyway...best show ever...end of review."
3,Gift for the hard to please,Purchased as a gift for a Hard to please relative. Good value and good quality. Added to the personal collection
2,price and disc errors make for disappointment,"Like alot of other NX fans looked forward to season 4. It is one of my favorite seasons and I preordered this in January. I was a bit annoyed to see the price so much lower now, but I was outright disgusted when I got my DVD's only to find 2 copies of disc 3 and no copy of disc 1. Now I have to return and wait who knows how long for a replacement and keep my fingers crossed that all 3 discs are in the package when the new one arrives. I'll continue to order the seasons as they are released but I won't preorder any more and will wait for the lower price. Overall I love NX and am happy to have my own copies of this beloved show, but each season has been a bit of a let down with the packaging issues, music and less than stellar way the discs are marked. At least in the end I'll have copies to watch as I want and not rely on reruns."
3,no instructions!,"I can't add a lot to the above comments, however, I do have one little fault. I am an experienced woodworker and had no problem understand how to use the holder. My concern is for less experienced users. The item arrives with instructions for assembly, but not how to use it. For one thing, the taper jig is not to be taken for granted! If not used properly one can be seriously injured. I find this a lot lately, manufacturers should always provide safe operating instructions."
2,"I love Richard but boy, this DVD... Geesh!","I get a workout but that's the only good thing. During the first song, there's some out-of-place screaming that is just bone-chilling. The kind of screaming you hear when your computer volume is on and that scary face shows up. And what's with the fuzzy photography? And then there is the traditional person who looks out of place in the workout. This time it's the lady dressed up in red and yellow (think ketchup and mustard). The camera loves her breasts and she makes these stupid faces. I'm surprised she doesn't fall out of her shirt."
1,terrible!,"This workout was horrible, I did not like it at all. I rather do minna's emergency's workout. She pays much more attention to a correct posture, making the moves correctly. With Richard Simmons: '80s Blast-Off DVD I could have done this workout without his DVD, just take some 80's music turn it on and start shaking all over make some weird moves, and there you go! I have the sense Richard Simmons is only making these DVD's to insure his bankaccount is well taken care off, there was nothing extra on this DVD what so ever. Just 30 minutes of moving and shaking around, in were I should feel like 'A NUMBER ONE' afterwards. Well i did not feel a number one, I felt an idiot because I paid to much money for this DVD.. Advise: Do Not Buy."
4,A few problems...,"This is a typical Richard Simmons exercise routine but this tape has a couple of problems. The camera work is done so that sometimes you can't see the next step or move needed until Richard and crew are well into it. This is because the camera is aimed elsewhere. Also where other Simmons tapes have small breaks between songs, this is edited so that when one is finished you immediately go into the next.It does provide a nice 30 minutes exercise session but you have to be on your toes to follow it all."
1,Boring,"I had read another review that stated that this Simmon's video just had the workout. While I was happy to see that it got right down to business, it was very poor quality and the workout is boring."
1,Don't bother,"While I love Richard Simmons, after I bought the DVD I was completely discouraged, it just jumps right into the workout, he gives you no instruction & you feel completely lost. I have purchased his other workouts in the past & they were great but this one was not worth the money I paid for it."
4,a good work out,"It is a little hard in the beginning because it moves so fast and it is a little hard to learn the steps, but you catch on!"
2,I was disappointed,"I have many of the Sweating tapes and looked forward to another exciting one. This was only a half hour long and had only two familiar songs. I am used to seeing all song titles on the jacket which helps me decide. On the positive side, the exercise routines were good. My issue is the songs keep me going and there was nothing on this tape to keep my interest"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this dvd because I do like 80's music as well as real people and Richard Simmons personality. I feel Richard put very little into this, he doesn't say much at all, and there are no extras and not many songs! I am sorry to say this Richard, but this was spastic and a waste of money."
3,A fun way to exercise,I was satisfied with my purchase because it's only about 30 minutes long and that's about all the time I have to spare. This is the 3rd Richard Simmons cd that I own. I have fun with it.
1,Richard! What were you thinking?,"I love Richard Simmons and have been using his tapes and DVD's since he began his career however this one goes in the ""donate"" pile. It looks and feels as if it were just thrown together. He gives little or no instruction (unusual) and the routines have little of his trademark creativity. I was exhausted at the end of the workout but not in a good way."
2,Blurry,I like the songs and the moves on this DVD. however; half of the DVD is blurry so you cannot see what they are doing.
2,Not same quality of other workouts,"I own several of Richard’s DVD’s…and am a fan of the SuperSweating Party (it is continuous from song to song while the older workouts stop between songs). I thought that I'd like to add another more recently produced DVD to my inventory hoping for the same continuous flow….however.....I think that this DVD may just be a sign that the era of the Richard Simmons workouts have come to an end. The quality of this was very poor compared to others, and there was some blurred portions where possibly the intent was to give it a modern feel..but it is actually pretty awful."
4,Fun,This video was fun and a good work out... as long as I could endure my husband heckling me and the video from the background.
2,eh...,"They're ok. Kinda generic. Not too bad I guess, just nothin new...I liked them better as the Nintendo game..."
4,I loved it to death!,"Okay, it was useful while it lasted, and it lasted 4 years until the counter stopped working. Other than that, it was a great pedometer. I replaced it with a cheaper one, and the cheaper one does not even compare to the OS pedometer. I love the fact that there is a cover for the pedometer that keeps it safe from bumps while you are wearing it, yet you can easily open it up to see your steps and mileage, and calories burned. I also liked the set up instructions being printed inside the cover, so you can easily reset the stride and weight, even if you've lost your original instruction sheet.The lightweight size requires it to have special batteries that you have to replace once every 2 years, but I think it is worth it (about $5) for the service the pedometer gives you. It is also a very durable plastic that takes a beating without breaking when it is dropped.I am going to buy another one because I think this is one of the best pedometers out there."
4,Great Price /Durable Product,"I've been impressed with this pedometer so far.It's been dropped a couple times already and is holding up very well. I have owned other brands that shattered on impact. This pedometer also has extra features like the backlight for checking the time or steps in the dark. The pulse meter is a nice bonus. I'm not sure the heart rate is medically accurate, but it does show me when it is elevated, and again when it is lower.....which is basically all I need to know.Great price for a durable product with extra features.Even with the price of shipping, it was still a good deal."
1,What a disappointment!,"Based upon other reviews of this pedometer, I had high hopes. Those were quickly dashed! This gadget is impossible to set! The MODE/SET button is one and the same, and it's easy to push it the wrong way, or have it not make contact at all. But even if it worked, the instructions are a nightmare! I even went online to the Oregon Scientific web page to look for updated instructions, but the user's manual is the same one that comes with the pedometer. After 10 minutes of poking and prodding, the MODE/SET button quit altogether. This is NOT a great Christmas gift. It's a dud!"
2,Pedometer with Pulse Meter,"I was disappointed in the meter, due to it was too complicated to set up. My son had to do it so I gave it to him. I just wanted a step counter with a pulse counter. That was the only one that I could find at the time with both."
1,TERRIBLE BAG,"I hate this bag...first and foremost when my bag slipped and hit the pavement with my D700 and many lenses in the case I though I was good to go. Not so fast, the bag has the worst bottom padding, I wish I would have kept the filter to show the extent of impact to my AF-S 24-70 1:2.8G that cracked into and ugly mass of glass. Had the filter not been on the lens I have no doubt the threads would have been smashed. I cant tell anyone enough to stay away from this junk. I will not buy anything from this company. If you want a case that is rugged and protects, this one is not it, I am still looking for a replacement. If I am going to use my camera and lens in one place its packed in a hard case."
5,"Excellent bag for 1 or 2 SLRs, a flash and a few lenses","The quality of the product is great.As for the capacity of the bag, it is about ideal for me.These are the things I can carry in my Nova 4:1. One Pentax K10D DSLR with 35 f/2.0 attached2. BG-2 battery grip3. AF360FGZ flash4. 50 f/2.8 macro5. 77 f/1.86. 50 f/1.47. 300 f/4.58. 50-200 f/4-5.6In addition to those, there are three spare D-LI50 batteries, 8 AA batteries, several SD cards, filters, two remote controls.But when I need to carry my camera with a bigger lens attached (16-50 f/2.8), I have to sacrifice the flash and the battery grip, or the long prime. From my perspective, the default layout of the bag and its inner dimensions are not ideal for this setup. I would wish this bag was a bit deeper (in Lowepro terminology) or higher. But not as big as the Nova 5.It is OK also to put two SLR's with small lenses attached plus a few small or medium size lenses and a flash, but it will be tight."
2,Double Check the Size...It's not as big as others let on,"Other reviewer wrote//////////////////////////////////"" I have crammed probably too much into this thing: A Nikon D200, Tokina 12-24 DX lens, Nikon 18-70mm DX lens, Nikon 50mm 1.8D lens, Nikon 75-300mm zoom, SB-600 flash, memory, camera and AA batteries, cleaner, filters, remote, flashlights, and various small flat things that fit in the flap. ""//////////////////////////////////I have the Nikon D90 and four lens and the SB600 flash.The only way I could get all that in this bag is if someone paid me money to do it. I would then have to unload two of the lens. I would not treat my equipment like this. I feel foolish for not checking or paying closer attention to the actual size. I bought this based on everyone rating this as 5 stars. Good bag, but it is too small for camera, four lens and a flash unit."
4,great bag if you can find it,"This bag will hold an slr an a couple lenses plus a pocket digi cam,flash and some cables.I did not want to hire a sherpa so this fits the bill for the grab and go use i need. looks like they are no longer making it so if you can find one at a great price-under [...] bucks then go for it. it does have a cover to keep rain out,but with all of the electronics in cameras today i know that water and electric do not mix so i would not trust entirely.good sturdy bag!"
3,"Little Off, but it works","The package states it's for '78-'86 models, but amazon said it would fit my '75 k10. It doesn't match the contours of my truck perfectly, but it's real close. I'd recommend it for the years stated on the box, but works fine for earlier models."
4,a good gift,a classical but special watch that gives a lady a piece for casual use or for a night out with friends
5,GUESS Women's Silver-Tone Crystal,the information given by you match the product receivedThank youM.Febres
1,It was a train wreck!,"I read the whole thing and laughed through most of it. It was poorly plotted and not even close to well-written. As I read it, I just kept thinking 'it has to get better...it can't get any worse!' I was wrong on both counts. She wrote this book based on the poem The Highwayman, but it doesn't really have that much to do with the original story therein. The sex scenes are poorly written and are not really conducive to advancing the story (okay...except maybe one). This book is really good for a laugh. It's kinda like a train wreck - you just can't look away."
4,Hot and Steamy!,"I read the book in less than 3 days, which isn't bad considering they were work days! The two main characters (Mariah and Andrew Clare) are very well developed and make you want to really care about them and all that they go through. The supporting cast is well written too (aside from the villian in the story - but I don't think that was the author's point - the rest is too overpowering). Overall, I found myself laughing, crying and dreaming with the entire cast.A word of warning, there are some typos in the copy (first printing) that I have but think the story overpowers the faulty spell check on the type setters computer.Finally, without giving anything away the storm and turret scene was a fantasy come true for me and worth the price of the book ten times over! You will have to read it to find out!"
2,A Slow Read,"This book should have been edited by someone who knew what they were doing. The author tends to ramble in places making the book plod on.....and on. It took me two weeks to read this book because of that and the fact that there are so many errors throughout the book. After I finally finished reading this book I went back with a highlighter and marked every error I could find with the intention of sending it back to the publisher demanding my money back. I found 58, speedreading. I'm sure I missed a few. While I enjoyed the storyline of this book, the author was too repetitive for my tastes. I decided not to save this book. It's going in the trash."
3,Good enough,A 26 minute interview disc recorded in 1996 on the eve of the release of Down on the upside. Good insight into the band and grunge scene.
2,"Looks good, performs poorly","Pros:- The blue-lighted display is attractive- Easy to setup- CheapCons:- The thumb screws break easily during assembly (I broke 2 of them)- The power supply plugin to the circuit board broke- Overall cheap componentryI owned this unit for about 6 months before the power cord attachment to the circuit board would short out, and I'd have to twist the plug in order to get it to make contact and power the unit. Now it does not work at all and I'll try to get a refund and find something better."
2,Power Supply Problems,"I have 3 of these units. Within a short time, two of the power supplies have gone bad. The first symptom was that the drives were suddenly dismounting randomly. Finally the computer would not recognize the drives at all. Swapping the power cables with the remaining good one did make the drive function properly again. Unfortunately, having to constantly order replacement power cables (at around $20 each or so) was not part of the deal.So avoid this product."
2,Won't last more than a year,"Anyone who gives this product a great review just hasn't owned it long enough. The wattage is really low which means you have to almost double most directions on frozen food, etc. In addition to being a hassle, this means food isn't cooked the way it should be and items are often rubbery or not the intended consistency. After several months of mediocrity, it breaks down. Still lights up and makes noise like it's working, but has ZERO heating capacity. It's cheap but not worth it. Spend the extra twenty bucks and get something that will last more than a year."
2,Only if you have a small space.,"I received this microwave for Christmas. It's attractive, small and fits nicely onto the shelf we have above the counter.I have nothing else good to say about it. It ruins food on a general basis, can't melt butter to save it's life, undercooks one serving then burns/dries out an exact duplicate. And someone please explain to me why? OH WHY? did someone design this microwave with a full sized popcorn speed key when you CANNOT prepare a full size bag of popcorn? The turntable falls off the track when the wind blows, I could go on and on."
3,Disappointed,I bought mine back in July and it just stopped cold yesterday after less than a year. I had a GE before that lasted 23 years. They told me to send back and they would send me another one. What a bother.
3,Microwave,"works fine, however the panel is printed black on gray, very hard to make out the numbers."
1,Disappointing power,"Purchased this microwave for use in my RV. Did not read reviews ahead of time, just saw it in Target and it was the right size. After installing and testing I noticed my tea was not very warm. Long story short, went to USDA site for info on microwaves. A 700 watt unit should heat one cup of ice cold water to boiling in 3 minutes or less. One cup of cool water (from fridge door) was put in a two cup glass measuring cup. After four minutes the water was only 185 F as measured by a candy thermometer. No visible sign of boiling. That puts it in the power range of 350 to 500 watt ovens according to the USDA site. I returned it. Cannot say if the unit was defective or if this is typical of this model."
4,"Good presentation, very informative",I am a novice and am in the process of reading and learning all I can about the technical foundations of sculpture. I found this book very easy to understand and well organized. The photographs and illustrations are top notch and add greatly to the understanding of the subject. This book is worth its price.
2,simplistic manual,I found this book to be overly simplfied and not very helpful accept maybe to the most novice sculptor. The appoach is that of amateur craft not serious art. I thought the photos of examples to be most uninspiring.
4,Dated but interesting.,"If you purchase this book knowing you are getting an outdated book you may enjoy it more. It has some good info in a few areas, especially in basic clay-up, but lacks in most modern mold making techniques. The sculpture in this book is basically classical to put it simply. I would still recommend this book especially to beginners."
2,Blaaaaa,I was thinking that this book would give me tips and ideas... its more of a history then how to.
4,An excellent novel.,"Not perfect; there are a couple of ways in which the characters seem a bit out of character (Sisko has a mild phobia of insects, which I don't believe we've ever seen elsewhere, and Dax demonstrates a level of discomfort with her femininity (having until recently beeen Curzon Dax, a male) that we certainly haven't seen elsewhere; a couple of attempts at character development that were good tries, but ring false.) But other than that, the characters are well-handled, and the plot is a good one. The writing itself is good, so this book is definitely recommended."
3,Beaters seemed fine,"Nothing wrong with them, but they didn't fit my mixer so I can't say how well they really work. Guess I am going to have to buy a new stand mixer."
5,awesome,"I thought this was a great book. I loved it and I would recomend it. I hate it when I'm reading and the book is totally predictable, but this book wasn't at all, and that's what kept me reading. I also liked how it has stuff in there about God."
5,Hate Reading,"This book was the best book I have ever read. I picked it up for a book report for my Church History class. I had 3 days to read it, and because it was so good, it wasn't that hard. The way she rights is very good. Kate Porter was a great character and so was Lukas. If you are even debating getting this, get it! You'll love it."
5,Jess Continues To Shine!,"Jessica Simpson has an amazing, beautiful voice that is unmatched by anyone. This single continues to prove that fact, and she shines on these two songs just as bright.Sweetest Sin: 5/5In This Skin: 5/5OVERALL RATING: 5/5"
3,Same but Good,This cd drags you in like it does through her other songs. I can't stop playing this cd but I know when all the hype is over it will just go down like all her others. It sounds very much like every other song she has ever done.
2,Not good enough to buy,"I wanted to like it, I really did. I've been disappointed by my favorite female artists' albums lately; I've got Michelle Branch in mind especially when I say that. The Sweetest Sin is catchy; I didn't take much out of it more than that small plus though. The best NEW female album of late is 0304 by Jewel. And even that you have to be patient with, but it's worth it once you get used to her new sound. If you wanted a great power ballad album go get Train's My Private Nation; I cannot think of anything that doesn't work. And if you want a younger take on the power ballad genre, Clay Aiken should have something out this fall. If you have extra money, go ahead and spend it; but, if you have to make a choice, don't choose Jessica Simpson't new album. There's better."
3,The Best Naturalistic Critique of the Book of Mormon,"This is probably the most sophisticated attack on the historicity of the Book of Mormon ever mounted. However, I don't think it succeeds. The various reviews of the book published by FARMS (the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies), coupled with other scholarship that FARMS continues to publish, seems to me to effectively counter much of what Metcalfe et al. put together here. And I don't really see any critics dealing successfully with the testimony of the various witnesses to the Book of Mormon plates. That is a serious gap in their critique."
1,Breaks very quickly,"I bought this at a Walgreen's pharmacy. They were 3 for $10 to be used for party favors for my daughter's 9th birthday party. The problem is not with the fan part: that spins fine. It's with the LED letters. I've had 2 so far for my daughter. The first one had leaky batteries, so I assumed that was the probelem, and I returned it. The second worked for a few hours, then the lettering got all messed up. I removed and replaced the batteries per the directions, but that doesn't help. I'll return it for a 3rd devices, but my hopes aren't high. I don't know how the others worked, as we gave them to the girls in their gift bags as they were leaving.I just found out how to fix it. You pull off the fan part, and bend the two very little metal contacts forward. Then push the fan on well, This seems to have helped, although I've had to do it a few times. With this fix, I'd increase the rating to 2 or 3 stars ( I can't see how to change the rating) as it is very cool when it's working"
2,Not a Fan,"I was looking for a fan, not a toy. The messages can be cute, but this is no good as a fan."
1,a hard decision,"i purchased 30 as wedding favors for $150.00. it's a few dollars more than the cheapest electric hand held fans. The fan's 2 ""blades"" are soft plastic and move NO air. I repeat, there is NO air that comes out of these fans, much less makes you feel any cooler. the LED message is very cool however. the fact that you can program it specific to the event, made me exclaim ""that's really cute"" when i turned on the 1st one. i've never seen anything like it and the message alone made me not return a single one."
3,Message Fan,The fans came in good time. The shipping and handling cost twice as much as each of the items ordered. I would have searched elsewhere for better shipping and handling cost if I'd paid attention when purchasing. The shipping city is only about 20 miles from me.The fan overall was easy to program and only 1 out of 30 did not work.
5,Emotional Rollercoaster That I never Wanted To End,"While the book really grabbed us due to it being vaguely Parallel to mine and my wife's lives, that's not the point. If you live in the rental from hell a.k.a. ""A Winter Rental"" and you survived, well then this is a must read. I remember years ago whe our kids were young. As the spring came the kids could play outside. The property owners would show up and start working on the house. How comfy is this when you're a little late on the rent? Carol's description of this exact situation made me cover my face with a pillow and sob. She describes the exact gut wrenching feeling that happens to all winter renters! That and her yearly visit to town hall to show Aubrey is still indeed dead are some of the most powerful moments I've seen in literature in a long time. This is such a great work that it must be spread so others will do it!"
1,This should not be the first programming book you read.,"I must disagree with the overwhelming reviews of this book given by other readers. As a complete novice in the area of computer programming, and after plugging away painfully through the first half of the book before anything started to become comprehensible, I came to one conclusion: either this book on COBOL is not really for ""dummies"" or I am too much of a ""dummy"" to even get through ""COBOL For Dummies"". After reading several other books on other computer languages, I now realize that the former is true. This book is not the place to start."
2,cobol for dummies,"Cobol for dummies is really for dummies. Smart people don't want to buy this book. This book only contain ""parts"" of program. But not a complete full reference. So people who has no experience in Cobol would finish reading it and end up being confused."
2,"not well organized, difficult to use",too much attempt at being funny (and not succeeding) useful information but hard to get at
3,Should have addressed compilers bundled with book,"As a dummy, I make lots of typos and syntax errors. This makes Fujitsu compiler spout more syntax errors than the program has lines. Given the tremendous sensitivity (for beginner's programs)the compiler has toward errors, the examples should have been compiler specific. I'm still working through the book, but 90% of the programming time has been spent tracking down compiler related issues."
3,This book is a good place to start,"I picked up this book before I started my mainframe training and it was nice to have as a reference. If you have never programmed in COBOL before then this book is for you.I have passed this book off to a fellow co-worker who is interested in learning COBOL.This book only gives you the very basics and that is it. But I would suggest that you read this book before trying to tackle a more involved book. Also, I don't think that this book will help you code very well, but it is good for definitions and simple explanations."
3,Caution: Fujitsu COBOL timed out,"We used this as a textbook for an Introduction to COBOL course during Fall Semester (August - December)1998. We sadly discovered that the Fujitsu compiler expired on October 31, 1998. Trick or treat? We use a different text this year... one that includes software that won't expire during the semester."
1,Outdated before it even hit the shelves,"Cisco no longer uses, nor do they recommend CSPM (Cisco Secure Policy Manager). Therefore, 60% of this book is irrelivant information.I wasted $60 on this book, only to find out later, that it was outdated."
4,Best workout CD for losing inches.....,"Tried other dvds but this one gives a good overall workout that is not too aerobic. It helps take off inches and pounds and tones good, too. It works upper and lower body. I have purchased it for other family menbers. I am a senior and this program includes working with weights (which my doctor says I need) to keep from losing muscle mass. I recommend it for a very good half hour workout."
4,Keeps you moving!,Just the right length. The music is good and you feel like you have had a work-out but not sore the next day. Good to get you started.
4,"Not bad, but could be better!","Obviously strength training and floor work are important parts of any workout. I was hoping to get a great Richard Simmons type workout, while focusing on these all important areas. The workout, however, is ok. I find that it is not very long, so I barely break a sweat. Also, I don't particularly like the music. I was hoping to find something more along the lines of his other exercise videos where the music is fun to sing and dance to. It doesn't even have the fun and excitement of the other videos because there are not so many people working out along with him. However, because I don't have a lot time to spend working out, Richard's video works well. You can pop it in early in the morning before you start your day. But if you are serious about strength training and floor work, I would find something else. This is not Richard's strong point."
2,:( :(,This product deserves a sad face for each star!this is a very disorganized way to exercise and instructions are very poorly given.
2,Defective product,The product shipped to me was defective and it is not easy to return per Amazon policies.
2,China is sure a third world country,"This book was on a suggested bibliography of books to read before visiting China prepared by Longitude Books. I dutifully read it. The Kirkus review is accurate-a lot of description in a non humorous way about the hassles of living in China. However, one does gain a sense of the passage of time and the many civilizations in Xian. Simon Winchester's book cited by the other reviewers is a lot better and you should read that first. Also I would suggest Death of a Red Heroine-a modern day mystery set in Shanghai for a description of modern Chinese life and how politics affects everyday life That book was one of the top five rated new mysteries of 2000 or 2001."
3,Not Too Far from the Truth!,"Down and Out in the Middle Kingdom is not the best book on China. In my Opinion ""Mandate of Heaven"" by Orville Schell is, and Simon Winchester's book on his journey along the Yangtze river are. But Brown is not far from the truth is portraying China as at times gray and depressing. I have been reading and interested in China for years, but my recent trip to China this summer was very anti-climatic. China has some great stuff and people, but the bottom line is that much of China is polluted, gray, and depressing. Anyone going to China and expecting Japan or the China of Mulan is in for a rude awakening. A trip to China is at times wonderful, and at times very trying and depressing. Its a mixed bag. This book acurately shows this aspect of China. Its a place of magical places and people, but its also a place of some not so great things. This book is a good read for its realism."
4,"Serious Sized, beautiful watch!",This is a large watch- the actual viewing area is around 42mm but with the bezel and outer edge it is around 48mm- but this is paired with the thickness which is seriously sized mates! this watch is beautiful but large and heavy as well- the nice thing is the left placed turner so it doesnt dig into your wrist- but still it is not a watch that is comfortable in the way of a thinner sleeker watch- you will never forget you are wearing it! it performs amazingly with the eco drive you can charge it with the sun or other light and go- the quality is that of a 450-500usd watch for certain and the band is nice- it does not interchange however witht he rubber one- a shame in my mind-it does appear to be antimagnetic which is nice and a feature usually foiund in pricier BALL watch etc- all told check out the aqualand as well as the calibre 2100 as other options but this one is a keeper for me!enjoy
4,A Hummer for the Wrist,"Being a fan of dive watches in general -- heavy, luminous, and indestructable -- I purchased the Citizen BJ8050-59E. Wow!When you read reviews and the phrase 'This is a BIG watch.' is used, they're not kidding. Be forewarned, this is a very heavy and bulky watch. If you like watches that play quietly on the wrist, this is NOT for you. My first impression was that this is truly a diver's instrument -- even though I don't dive. People will stare at your wrist when you wear it. Although some women may like to wear men's watches, this is truly a man-size watch.I love the simple dial. The luminous dial is equal in brightness to my Seiko monster -- which is saying alot. The markers glow a beautiful aqua blue.If what I've written so far appeals to you, buy the watch. You won't see too many people sporting it."
5,Very durable,"I have had this radio for about 7 YEARS, and my children grew up playing CD's on it. They dropped to the floor many times. It even continues playing upside down. At this point I think it's indestructible. I'm so glad I bought it when I did."
3,"I'm a Laurel and Hardy fan, but....","...whoosh, the style of this book is turgid and overstuffed with mixed metaphors (on the order of ""They were the conduit for blossoms of comedy which were to explode in fiery mirth.""), and there's far too much ""Babe had terrible trouble, which will be explained in due course."" I did like the subject, but the book was really irritating to read because of the style."
1,Put on your hip boots,"VERBOSITY, n. the employment of a superabundance of words; the use of more words than are necessaryThis probably describes all this author's works. I had a terrible time wading through his bio on W.C. Fields and had to skip over most of it. I disposed of that book as soon as I was finished with it. When I got this book out of the library I had fogotten all about the author. But when I started reading ""Stan and Ollie"" I quickly looked at the cover and cried, ""oh, no!."" I made it through almost three chapters before giving up.Yet, I am a person who loves to read how an author weaves words together. That is part of the pleasure of a book. But this author doesn't weave, he just pours! This book could be a third of its length and do its subjects far better justice"
3,Mounting hardware stinks,"Not a bad mirror in general, but the bolts that came with it stink. The head of one twisted off with very moderate force."
4,Great Product,"This fit perfectly on my 77 CJ7. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the hardware is a little cheap, but worked fine."
2,Confused by Utterly Confused,"I concur with Mr. K. Galligan's review above, I too spotted some of the same mistakes, moreover, on page 12 the author introduces the subject of Linking Verbs by using the term ""predicate"", although this is an introduction chapter and she has not yet defined what a predicate is, so for those who are unenlightened, or just learning grammar, they need to go to the index where they will find that the definition is on page 52, in chapter 4. I thought the approach illogical. One does not teach the basics by beginning with terms that have not yet been defined.The author begins the selection on verb tenses by explaining that there are six tenses in English, although another grammar book I consulted explains that there are in actuality twelve tenses altogether. The section on the distinction between ""who"" and ""whom"" was not particularly well explained either. For a grammar book that was supposed to help those who are utterly confused I found this book confusing."
2,Unimpressed by battery charge life,"This thing has a nice spot light which focus very large in comparison to other Xenon I have used. However, one major downfall to this product is that battery life does not stay charge for more than 30-45 minutes of usage. It started to dim out and won't turn on until you let it rest for a couple of minutes and then the progression just get worst from there.Very disappointing."
1,Didn't last - no satisfaction from Brinkmann,"I used this light three times. The halogen spot quit working. I called customer service, they told me I needed a new halogen bulb, even though I told them the bulb looked fine and I tested no current at the bulb. Then they told me I probably just needed to buy another spotlight. They were right about that. I should have bought another spotlight instead of this one. I won't buy another Brinkmann at any price."
1,Battery life is terrible.,"I actually bought this light at Wal-Mart because in big bold letters on the package it read 80 HOUR BATTERY LIFE. I didn't see til later that in small print underneath that statement it read ON LED MODE. The LED isn't bright. A regular cheap flashlight is brighter than the LED. The hallogen on the other hand is incredibly bright and works well FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. We use it to take the dog out to go to the bathroom and that's about it. Oh, and heaven forbid the dog takes more than 10 minutes, because then we're left in total darkness for the walk back up to the house. Awesome."
1,Brinkman Flashlight - Halogen,"I would never buy another Brinkman product - After receiving this item I immediately plugged it in to charge it as noted in the instruction booklet - let it charge for the twelve hours as noted, un-plugged it and nothing. I had another Brinkman flashlight for about a year and the battery just stopped taking a charge. Black and Decker has a nice one for about the same price - bought it at Walmart."
1,Not Practical,The short battery life coupled with the fact that the light CAN NOT be left oncharge without fear of damage makes this item impractical for most uses. Keepshopping.
1,broke already,Thought it was great for following my dog around the dark yard.Well the halogen stopped working after 3 uses..how is it dead yet? my dollar store flashlight lasts longer.Then i tripped on the stairs outside with it in my hand and of course bashed against the concrete to breakmy fall..now there are loose pieces ratting around.It does give a nice light. But being that it is rechargeable probably doesn't save money if you have to replace expensive bulbs too.
2,Battery life stinks!!,"We have had this flashlight for quite some time and ever time it was used for a few minutes it had to go back on the charger. Don't dare leave it off the charger, you will not be able to use it next time you need it. So basically it probably cost more in electricity to keep it charged up than what it was worth. Do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS FLASHLIGHT. I see now that on Amazon it is currently ""unavailable""... probably good reason... They stink! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the bulbs never burned out. But that could be because it was not used much due to it not holding charge for very long before it had to go back on charger."
1,Brinkmann 800,The Brinkman 800 was my favorite for 5 years.But the Battery stoped charging.So I ordered a new One.The new 800 would not charge!I would plug it in and get a red light flash on theCharger Plug -- and then nothing.I called in and was sent a second 800I opened the new case and had the same problem--Won't Charge
1,Practically zero battery life.,The light's bright and awesome for the whole 10-15 minutes that you get to use it before it dies.Buyers beware!
1,Not Working at ALl,I received this today and it DOES NOT WORK. They have a no return policy at AMAZON for this item that I just now discovered. Not very happy at all. DO not buy this product unless they will let you return it.... IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL BRAND NEW IN BOX
1,Brinkman Rechargeable Spotlight is a Rip-Off.,"Brinkman #800-2232-0 Dual Rechargeable Halogen LED Spotlight is junk. LED is single bulb and not bright. Don't know about 1 million candle power halogen as it doesn't work at all, but the whole unit weighs very little indicating not much of a battery. Light will not recharge with either cord. All this is new out of the box. Or, I should say out of the cheapy blister pack. Amazon will not accept return as rechargeable batteries are ""Hazardous Material"", so you must call Brinkman. Brinkman works you thru the computer routine only to tell you at the end that if you will leave a phone number they will return the call. I didn't. I figure Amazon and Brinkman just milked me for twenty bucks and I will consider that the price of my ticket to ignore Brinkman completely in the future."
1,spot don't work at all!!!!,I received the product which had to be charged for 8 hours! It was burning day so all packaging material to include the box it came in and the plastic it was encased in was burnt up. After the 8 hour recommended charge time the flashlight works but the spot ( the reason for buying it) does not work! I feel ripped off and will not purchase another item if it is listed by the distributor I received it from!
2,short battery life,"bought this product and has about 10 minute life on one charge, not very reliable when you need light, will not buy another brinkman. not recommened."
1,junk,Out of the package the halogen light did't work. I tried to use the charger and it also failed. I won't even try to get this repaired. I should have checked the reviews better.
1,absolute garbage,"this item is not worth ordering at all. A great idea, but absolute garbage, would not turn on, would not charge up."
3,battery bust,"This spotlight is functionally great....Light weight, compact, dual intensity....good for short bursts of high power and long periods of low power. I would love to keep it and use it for years. However, Brinkmann has made a marketing decision to join the throw-away society.....The battery is not practical to replace....goodbye spotlight....goodbye Brinkmann! My future purchases of rechargeable battery devices will require that the battery be easy and practical to replace! I hope others join the effort...."
2,It will be a throwaway...,"I liked this light when it was working, although the battery charge never lasted very long when using the spotlight. Eventually it got to the point the battery will not charge, so it needs a new battery. No problem you say, think again. This battery is not available anywhere, and is an oddball physical size so no other can be substituted. Everything else about the light is fine, but without an available replacement battery it is just so much junk. This kind of thing has become all too common since China dominates the market for all our products."
4,BRINKMAN 800 HALOGEN LIGHT,I have 2 of these lights and they work well for what I use them for. They generate a lot of light for a an hour or so. I did buy 2 of the more expensive Brinkman lights that were supposed to hold a 4 hour charge and both were defective and had to be returned. I think the 800 is the best light for the price if an hour of light is enough.
5,Great light,"I had one of these lights years ago, and it finally gave out. They used to carry them at wal-mart, but not anymore. The first oneI ordered did not work, but they made it so easy to send back, and sent one that did work great. I already knew all about the light,and such a bright beam. I use it a lot on my 12 acres at night."
1,sucks,i have this plugged in all the time.the halogen spotlight runs for 3 mins until it is dead. then it requires a LONG charge time.do not buy!
2,old beans hard to cook,old beans hard to cookcook the beans over 5 hour never get tender this it what happen wen beans are old
2,Error-filled again,"Yet again Ms. Emberley has created a book out of a dictionary, and again, it has errors. For example, she calls a square a ""cuadro,"" which is plain wrong. A ""cuadro"" is a painting whereas a ""cuadrado"" is a square.These books are certainly pretty to look at and are geared to entertain children, but their poor, error-filled content make them a poor choice to actually teach Spanish."
1,Avoid at all cost!!!,"I bought a couple of these, and now regret it greatly. In less then a week one of them broke. If I didn't know better I would think that they had been pulled at the way it broke between the link, also the clasp seemed stretched somewhat. In any case, I would avoid it, and find a higher quality necklace someplace else."
5,Very Good quality,This snake chain was exactly what I wanted and was very good quality. I'd buy from this seller again.
4,Actual dimensions different from description,"These drawer liners are fine for most toolboxes. The actual dimensions are 20x16.5 instead of the 22x16.5 in the product description. That means it's a little short on going the full width of typical toolboxes. I purchased these liners for a Craftsman 4-Drawer Ball-Bearing Tool Cart, Model 62021. The width of the drawers is described as 22 3/8"".The great thing is that you don't have to cut these liners to fit in a full depth tool cart like I have, and I only have to make one cut to fit most drawers of my mid chest and top chest that go with the tool cart. The minimal cutting makes for a quick installation. The thickness is typical for toolbox liners that I've seen, and it feels like the liners won't be prone to sliding against the floor of the drawers.Having the error in the description and leaving slight gaps on either edge of the drawers are the only things keeping me from rating this a 5 star."
2,A Waste of Time,"Don't spend your hard-earned money on this book. If you really want to learn about developing content for the Web, buy a good grammar book, a good style book and a good Web design book. ""Developing Online Content"" is little more than a rehash of other publications, inflated with meaningless graphics and unnecessary new terms. The only worthwhile parts of the book are the lists of resources."
2,Not one of his best,"Typical Laymon-lots of blood, guts and sex-but unlike his other (and longer) books this one lacks the well thought out storyline and instead goes for something that makes the reader think it has been made-up as it goes along. Something the writer wrote to pay his bills. As a devoted Laymon fan, I recommend you try for one of his newer books as they are seeming to get better with time, but if you are a devoted fan like myself you'll need to read this one. It has all the things we love about Laymon with a nice little twist at the end."
4,Beyond Billy the Kid,"A lean, grimy re-casting of the 'Billy the Kid' myth, with a buck-toothed psychopath playing the lead black hat. Our hero, sherif Calvin Taylor (this is third in a series of four Calvin Taylor books) tries to close down the kid's criminal pastimes and maximum damage ensues.'The Arizona Kid's' brusque and brutal prose will delight fans of the well-told tale. The desert setting leaves your mouth dust dry, the violence is vivid and squirm inducing. If McBride's stories can't bring the western back to life then someone better call an undertaker."
4,"Not bad at all, but have flaws","This books is cool and everything,however;this book does have flaws. This book isn't complete,by the time you are finished with the series you will know like 500 kanji but you need MORE to be able to read a book or something like that. And finally,this book doesn't show ALL of the root words for a kanji. I'm not saying this book sucks,however; I do think the publisher does need more word on it."
4,"250 essential kanji for everyday use,vol.1",it 's a usefull bok for every people who want to learn and to writen japonesekanji.
1,Beck Arnley,Show the right part for car but didnt fithope next time you guys put an item on the internet is the right part
3,Cute Lawyer Tricks,"I ordered this DVD thinking it would be professionally done. It seemed like just Massad speaking to a few people, and for a short time. I liked what he said as usual, but there wasn't enough of it. It seemed like just a taping of an informal gathering. The rest of the DVD is filled with other stuff used just for filler."
4,Very cute!,"I bought this watch for my 8 year old. It fits perfectly, works well (so far), and she absolutely loves it! She wanted to wear all the bands at one time!"
5,Great item,fantastic buy for my 7 yr old daughter. she wanted a watch for christmas and loved the interchangeable bands. Great item!
3,little girls would like this,"With 7 changeable bands, I am sure girls would like this products. It give them a new look everyday. Also teach kids how to read the time with the numbers."
2,Could not even finish it,"My apologies to the author, but this book was just not worth it. I got through about 60 pages and just could not go on. If you want good fantasy try George R. R. Martin ""Storm of Swords."""
3,Decent,"A solid file, but the softer sides wear down somewhat quickly. all in all I would recommend this if you're in the market."
4,"Fun, lighter than usual, Hitchockian thriller from Bava","Bava pays explicit homage to Hitchcock in this fun, mostly light heartedmystery.An American girl vacationing in Rome witnesses what might be a murder(or is it her overactive imagination, spurred on by her love of cheap mysterynovels?). And before you know it, she's the possible target of a serial killer.The black and white photography is beautiful, but Bava tones his style downjust a bit, and it works; the photography compliments the story, without swamping it,.There are weak spots, like an annoying voice over that insists on explaining whatthe images are making very clear by themselves, and performances that are uneven(especially in supporting roles). But, the bottom line is, if it wasn't in Italian, onecould even believe this was a Hitchcock film, which is a pretty high compliment..."
5,Classic Queers EP,"Definitely a must-have, this CD EP has 4 Queers songs, consisting of: 1. Surf Goddess - this is an excellent love song, very memorable. 2. Mirage - awesome version of the Shondels cover that was in Beat Off. 3. Get Over You - awesome Undertones cover. 4. Quit Talkin' - amusing surf song with great guitar riffs. Don't miss out on this classic Queers EP. Also try out Everything's OK."
5,Great for my crafts!,I have been looking for gold that I could add to my paperweights and this product fills the bill perfectly. Nice sized flakes are in the package and they will show up well in my creations. I am very pleased.
3,Description felt unclear.,"The description of this product did not make it clear that this product contains no gold. Yes it says composition gold flake, my assumption of that was it was like 5k gold or even lesser. This contains no gold, it is Zinc and Copper. Looks like real gold and is very nice, but I kinda needed real gold. I guess these will work for lack of actual product."
1,Eeew,This perfume smells BAD. Everyone that I have asked if they like it just wrinkled their nose. I can't even give this away.
4,Lovely,"Lovely scent, nice price. Really does smell like Lily of the Valley. It was just what I was hoping for. Only downside is that the scent does not last very long, tends to wear off quickly."
2,Disappointed in scent.,"I was disappointed in this scent. On me, it smells more like soap than a floral fragrance. Does not remind me of Lily of the Valley at all."
1,Horrible,"Awful! Smell like soap, not at all like fresh lilli of the valley, and + to this it's came in open box, like several people before me already receat this and sent it back....was very dissapointede, sent it back, just got my money..I wouldn't suggest it.... don't spend your money for this"
4,Great compendium for wine lovers,"A hefty volume, over 450 pages, embracing wines of the world--everything from geography (great maps), to wine glasses, to vintages, to growing practices and what to drink with what food. Published in the US in 1970 and just before in Switzerland, still enormously value (not much changes in the wine world in such a short time!), this a very instructive book with great photos, graphics and charts. Pour yourself a glass of muscadet or albarino and enjoy!"
4,Lacking options,"The LEDs are very bright and the unit seems well constructed, but you have no control over the ""buzzer"" it is just a beep for about 1 sec. And I got this specifically for the interval timer option, but the ""interval"" is only programmable for 0 seconds or 15 seconds. It would have been perfect if I could have set the interval for whatever time I would like. I was wanting to be able to set it for 5-10 minute rounds with a 1 minute break, now we will have to set it manually each time."
3,Great but loud,"Great product, but the website doesn't tell you that there is a piercing alarm sound that cannot be turned off. Not good for indoor use."
2,MacGregor Count down clock,The display is hard to read in any kind of light and after just 8 months of sporadic use the battery now no longer recharges.
3,Indoors only,The only thing I don't like about the clock is that while using outdoors sunlight doesn't allow the numbers to be seen
2,There is a reason this is the cheapest sports countdown clock around.,"When the unit is functioning, it works great! Nice bright display, good size than can be seen from a hundred feet or so away, and easy to use controls.However, my unit will not charge the provided 6.7V Lead Acid battery. I don't know if it is because of faulty charge circuitry, or a faulty battery, but either way the portable feature of this clock was DOA. I left the unit plugged in and turned off for 48+ hours, no battery charge. Left unit plugged in and turns on for 48+ hours, no battery charge.It is still a functioning timer - though sometimes you'll have to cycle power a few times to get it to ""boot up"" - but I had intended on using it away from a wall outlet. Perhaps I can find a replacement battery."
5,Naked Leader,"This is the only business book that I have read from cover to cover and then gone back to use as a reference. The format of the book, life journeys and short sharp chapters keep you wanting more and reading on to find the next nugget. This book cuts through the jargon and its easy to read language make it accessible to all. You don't have to be a CEO to benefit from this book, it demonstrates that we can all be better leaders and provides guidance on how to make the most of each day and each situation. Even if you are not a line manager, if you work in a team or interact with others in the course of your work then you will benefit from reading this book. As well as providing some life changing guidence there are also some laugh out load moments along the way. In my experience this is unlike other business books in that you want to keep reading. Buy it for yourself and your best friend."
5,"Great Product , okay deal","With shipping and sale comes to 7.79 a can. That beats the majority of walmarts and chain autopart stores. Awesome product , does exactly what it says."
5,Book for all ages,"Lovely story, lovely watercolor artwork. It is a tale that fits for us all, on how we manage our heart and try to avoid pain."
5,"If it's a dog's life, we should be so lucky!","This little book is a total hoot, especially when we're in the dog's point of view. The imagry and humor in Fudgeballs is superbly done and one can believe this is actually the way dogs think.As for the romance between Dave and Jenny, and their misunderstanding, it was cleverly done and kept you on your seat wondering when our hero and heroine were going to figure out who was supposedly moving. Given the subject, though, I think I gained ten pounds just reading about all that delicious fudge!Gee...I wonder what bull-poodles really look like? -Lee Emory"
2,don't buy if you have even mildly sensitive skin,"Cups ran large, and the plastic lining (designed to keep the bra up when worn strapless) irritates sensitive skin horribly. Three days later, I still have red marks on my sides from where the plastic made contact with my skin."
1,NO NO and NOOOOO,"I like the design but there is a fine layer of plastic. Each time I wore this bra, it would burn my skin."
3,Cups too close together,"Will be returning bra. Pretty and had the rubber so there's no slippage, but too tight and cups were too close together so it looks unnatural if looking at the bra itself on. Looked ok with clothes on over it though."
5,Inital D DVD Review,"All the disks arrived in perfect condition, brand new just as stated. I love this show and i was very happy to find it at this price. I don't know what else to say, it came in the saran wrap, sealed, with all the stuff. It made me happy"
5,Guide and Index,Very helpful! I have been having a hard tiome finding things on various subjects that I want to study. I can now look up a subject quickly and easily.
3,1993 Chrysler Concorde Owners Manual,Every thing was in here just not the cover that is pictured here. I was able to find the info I needed.
3,"eh, not his best, dvd is sort of cool.","The two songs here are not as immediate as anything from the instant classic ""I Get Wet"" but that's ok. The DVD is fun, and for the price of a single you really get your money's worth. Makes me nervous for the new album though..."
2,Too cloudy,"I thought I could sacrifice quality for size but that was a mistake. I bought these for myself for my birthday along with a pendant that was H-I and with fewer inclusions. Next to the pendant these earrings looked even more dull and of poor quality. I ended up returning the earrings and spending a little more on better quality. If you can, I'd recommend spending the money on a better cut with greater clarity. If this is the upper limit of how much you'd like to spend get a smaller size, better cut & clarity."
5,amazing probiodic,"I first used (HMF Replete) back in June, after a 2 week dosage of antibiodic and pain meds. This was essential in regaining a proper and functional digestive system.I will definately recommend this product to friends and family. :):)THANKS!Becky"
5,Great gift!,"This made a great gift for grandpa at Christmas! Clips on the visor great, and is not flimsy at all! I also bought the grandmother one and loved it too! :)"
2,Just a fancy switch,"What this is: a fancy switch with an LED in the switch.What this does: it allows you to switch between 3 brightness levels and 2 blinking modes. While on, it runs a dim red LED in the switch.Drawbacks: The Maglite still has to be turned on via the normal method by rotating the focusing head; this switch does not work with LED maglites. There is no way to store a spare bulb with this switch.Be careful - this looks a lot like the upgrade kit with an on/off switch and an LED bulb. This is not an LED bulb, it is just a fancy switch.In my honest opinion as an engineer, you are much better off with an LED maglite."
1,Nite Ize NIQ-07-AA JUNK...,"This switch has multiple functions as indicated, but on the highest setting only has about half the output of the regular MAG battery cover..."
1,Don't bother getting one of these...,"Bought it, tried it in my Maglite AA.All I got for my money was dim intermittent blinking light."
4,Nite Ize IQ switch,Great idea. Good product. The only problem with the switch is that it doesn't remember the setting that you lift it on. It always goes back to a default setting. Also it is a little uncomfortable to operate the switch because is to recessed in the body to operate easily. Other than that it is a good product.
2,Works but very very crappy quality,"This one is my third one I have purchased. The previous one broke as soon as I accidentally dropped flashlight. The second one broke after a few months of use. The only reason why I kept purchasing this is because I don't like how the MagLite turns on by twisting the top. I carry my MagLite on my belt for work and throughout the day I'm constantly sitting up, down, and moving around. It manages to twist itself on during the day and I usually don't realize it until the end of the day. This thing eliminates that because you turn it on from the bottom."
2,Excellent idea ... Bad implementation,"I really like the idea of this switch. Several settings and a slow strobe or blinking effect. The problem is that the flashlight becomes noticeably dimmer no matter which setting you use. I tried different bulbs, batteries, and tail caps. Everytime I used the IQ Switch, there was a decrease in brightness. I just don't see that as beneficial for a flashlight so I give it 2 stars."
3,Does NOT work with LED Maglite,"I bought this switch with a 3 AA LED Mini Maglite. The light works fine; the switch works fine. They don't work together. This tail cap replacement isn't nearly long enough to replace the tail cap in the LED MiniMag. It will work in the standard incandescent MiniMag, though.The switch is a little small, but that's to be expected if it is made to fit a small light. It is relatively easy to press and the occasional faint blink from the rear LED is not annoying, as I feared it would be. On the whole, a satisfactory product."
1,I did not read but gave the book as a gift,"This was given as a gift to someone so I've not read the book, but I knew the person was very interested in getting a copy."
5,Great between bath spray,"I use this on my dogs between baths. It works really well, very simple. I just spray it on, and let it just dry in a bit. It is not the same as having a bath but it works wonders between baths, this is especially true for labradors (you know the doggie smell). Plus it is good for the animals skin, I highly recommend this product"
4,"Nice Smell, Detangles Well","My Lhasa Apso puppy needs a daily brushing. She plays hard, rolls in the dirt and grass, and gets a lot of ""backcombing"" from people loving to rough up her fur. The conditioner ends even the toughest tangles with ease and leaves a soft scent that isn't too overwhelming. I have lots of people comment that she smells so fresh and nice."
4,delicious scent,"Honestly, I have never used this product. I bought it as a gift. However, I was really satisfied with the scent (not at all overpowering). And I was really happy to find a product like this for dogs. The packaging is cute, and my sister was really happy with the gift. Her dog always smells great and has a beautiful coat."
4,Smells Great,Not much to say about this other than it's really great smelling; fresh and not at all obnoxious as some of the other scented sprays can be.
4,Awesome conditioner,I have been using this conditioner for a few years. I spray it on my Jack Russells after their bath.
1,Not for us.,"After reading all the good reviews on this I felt it was a good thing to try for my little toy poodle. He gets professionally groomed every 2 weeks and home groomed daily so I was just looking for something that would keep his fur soft and tangle free. This spray does smell good, and I could smell it on him during the day, but it made his fur feel dryer than it did before I used it. Plus, he had more mats in his fur as well. Can't explain it just know how it worked on him. I love the cloud star itty bitty buddy treats and will continue to get him those, but as far as conditioner goes, this was not a good one for him. I'll go back to the one I normally used which left no dry or matted fur. And yes, I did shake it well before use."
2,expensive and doesn't smell so nice.,"I bought this for my dogs, well after I received it, I didnt like the smell, and I saw it three dollars cheaper at my local pet store. I suggest using earthbath mango tango spray. now that smells good and it stays on your dog!"
3,not really a fan,"its ok, leaves a nice smell but thats about it. I used it a couple of times and ditched it."
1,Disappointing Watch Winder,"Looks nice, but the instructions are confusing, the unit is loud when it operates and lasted only 14 months. Keep searching for a better alternative."
2,Steinhausen Dual Auto Watch Winder-Cherrywood,"The instructions made little if any sense. I had to call tech support to understand what switch positions are related to which mode. The slots that hold the watches in the drawer are too narrow. And, it doesn't seem to actually wind the watches very well."
2,Won't Last,Purchased this unit and it worked for about a year. It looks better than it performs. If you really want a reliable watch winder -- look elsewhere and don't focus too much on looks.
1,"This book documents the North Carolina exhibit, not the San Francisco one",After visiting the recent Dutch exhibit at the Legion of Honor Museum I was impressed by the Jan Miense Molenaer paintings.The book on his work was fantastic but the line was long and I had an appointment. I made a mental note to look for it later on Amazon.The book that came (same cover) did not have the same artwork.(About half). Several of my favorites from the exhibit were missing but over half the images are in both books so its too cost prohibitive to duplicate. Very disappointing. The fact they have the same title and cover is very misleading.
5,Yakolev history and aircraft revealed,"Yefim Gordon and his asociates are working through Russian aircraft manufacturers similar to the way Putnam books did with predominantly UK manufacturers, This book is 384 pages of information, many photos and many drawing. There is a section called ""A brief history of the Yakolev OKB"" followed by sections on Lightplanes 1924-43 and continuing with 10 further types categories and ending with pilotless aircraft and a short color photo selection. Although expensive, it is a good value for the money particularly if you are interested in Russian aviation history and cannot read Russian"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"For the price, this program has a lot of bells & whistles: a nice lead sheet creation tool, a keyboard window & a decent set of effects.Unfortunately, editing is a nightmare, which defeats the purpose of having a multi-track platform. For example, once you select/highlight an area on a track that you wish to edit, you cannot de-select/unhighlight it. So you can't tweak or fine tune your initial highlighting. Along with this, there is no ""undo"" button that would allow you to deselect/unhighlight the area & do it again. Along the same vein, there is no way to fine tune placement of the cursor--it's point, click and pray. The best you can do is zoom in to the max and click the cursor where you want it. I've seen other programs that allow you to use left arrow/right arrow to fine tune your cursor placement at any level of zoom. Not so here. It seems goofy not to include these simple editing features but--you get what you pay for."
4,"Good light, could be brighter","I purchased 2 lights, one came with a base(green) & the other with an adapter plug that plugs into the back of the light(orange). I love the green one, I actually use it in my bedroom, but the orange one is not very bright. I can't use it in my toddler's room, not enough light for him. I actually use it in the hall upstairs. I don't think it is enough light to change a dirty diaper (#2) unless you have it right there, attached to your wrist!! But it is a great light for an older child & even a parent! Very safe for the child to hold."
2,Amazon still has these wrong,"After being assured that the confusion over the regular MOBI light and the one with the recharging base had been cleared up, I purchased this item that claims to be the ""portable rechargeable"" light. However, it is still the regular light that needs to be plugged into a power cord to be recharged. I would return it but my older son has claimed it and really likes it.In addition to being represented as a different item, the charge IS NOT lasting for 10 hours as MOBI claims. We charge it all day, and then my son puts it in bed with him at around 9pm. It usually goes off sometime between when I go to bed at midnight and when my daughter wakes up for a bottle at around 2am.It's cute, and it stays cool to the touch, but I wouldn't buy it again."
2,save your money,"I own about 10 knitting books, and this one is the first one with which I am disappointed. Many of the patterns in here are quite intuitive; meaning, that one probably doesn't need a book to be able to figure out how to knit them. Books with felting patterns should highlight patterns that are difficult to create. Otherwise, what's the point of buying a book? The challenges of felting are in determining scale and ratio, and anticipating shrinkage when you felt the item. None of these patterns are particularly interesting or nice-looking.Given its 2003 press date, I would have liked to see more fashionable items like a bucket hat, a striped felted bag with closure, and more useful household items, like a fruit bowl. Instead, the patterns include a bowler hat, felted mittens, dowdy looking slippers and several simple square bags. Its saving grace is a nice-looking felted rug, but I could have probably figured that one out as well. Isn't it just a rectangle?"
4,nicely done.,"This book has lots of cool patterns,tips and info. I will probably use these patterns more then all the others I've ordered so far."
4,Felted Knits,This is a great book even for a fairly new knitter. I made the oven mitt and it turned out just like it should. The info about felting in the washing machine is very complete. I only wish the directions for making the oven mitt had been a little bit more complete like letting the reader know to switch ti double pointed needles when shaping the mitt at the top.
5,Over the age of 30,This plane was a gift for a lifetime lover of Lego and he is still enthralled with the plane! Lego is fun for all ages!
3,"Good product, but part missing","This was in good shape, but not ""Like New"", since it was packaged in a box for a piece of cookware, and it turned out to have a small but fairly important part missing (a narrow piece from the side of the plane)."
4,fun but not very easy to keep,"I got this plane for christmas two years ago and played with it so much. I loved it. My sister put all of the passengers into her Krusty Krab. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because i lost the one little piece that held the door on and it never worked again. I found the piece later on, the the plane was already in pieces mixed in with a large bucket of other pieces. Since then the plane has been no use. It is very fun but you have to keep track of every single part or else it will stink."
2,No ridges?,For some reason this frisbee lacks the trademark ridges that make other Wham-O frisbees so easy to grip! Not recommended.
4,Muy comodos,"Y estaban a muy buen precio ($ 25). Yo soy talla 10.5 , pedí 10.5 pero me quedaron chicos así que recomiendo que pidan media talla más que la suya. Los recomiendo mucho, más aun a ese precio."
5,MOST COMFORTABLE.......LIKE WEARING SLIPPERS,Love these shoes. Its a cross between shoes and sneekers. Paid $25.00 with free shipping! Can't beat it!!!!!Tommy
3,Skechers Sport Men's Stamina Razor Slip-on,Price is good but the comfort level is not as high as I expected.
4,Very knowledgeable author,"This book is written in British English, so for Americans who know English, it will be sort of enjoyable to point out the differences between us.This book explains to non-Asians why the Shinkansen is so important to Japan, beyond simply as one mode in the cross-country transportation network.I got this from my university's library and now I see that costs over one hundred dollars! That's amazing. But I think that's because this book won't sell many copies and the author does an amazing job making sure he tells you about the ""new trunk line"" better than anyone has before. At least any native English writer ever has. It's the only book UIC has on the subject."
5,The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins,"The Moonstone is an excellent book, with a gripping storyline from beginning to ending. It is full of twists, and the reader is promised a thrilling ride. The plot was wonderfully thought out and the ending is so unexpected that the reader can't help but be shocked.Read it, people of the world, and discover a fantastic novel!"
4,"Excellent condenced review text, but no test questions","I found this book to be a great up to date (2000) review of pharm. It has just a bit more information than a pure review book, like the lippincott's pharm rewiew. The extra info helps put the drugs more in context to why they work or don't. It does not have questions to test yourself, the questions come in another ""companion"" book to this, so there is extra expence if one wants that- the only down side (lippincott's has questions in the same book). The class that I'm in is pretty much split on which one they prefer (the questions in the lippincott book sway some)."
1,What a disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this cd. After reading the description, it sounded like it would be right up my alley. But boy was I disappointed in this plodding, hookless disaster. To make things worse, two of these clunkers are over 7 minutes long, and another is a mind-numbing 12 minutes! Listen fellas, you've got the sound down, now you just need to work on the songwriting part. Word to the wise: steer clear of this time and money waster and buy a Byrds, Buffalo Springfield or Rain Parade album instead."
1,Straight to the used bin,"I bought this CD partly because of the 5 star review below, and now I wonder if the reviewer took acid BEFORE listening to it! I've played this disc at least half a dozen times, and for the life of meI can't remember a single ""tune"". I'm a massive fan of Byrds/Love/Paisley Underground type bands, but this doesn't even come close. I literally laughed out loud a few times, between the stoopid, faux-mystical lyrics and ridiculously over-the-top production job. A friend thought one track was a Spinal Tap outtake!And please---somebody get these guys an editor!"
1,How to save money!,"To all the spaniards that may read this: menos mal que no compré el disco. Fui lista y leí las críticas antes. Luego he hablado con un amigo que lo compró y coincide en su impresión: un verdadero ladrillo. Si queréis ahorraros unos euros o unos dólares, sed inteligentes, y bajadlo de internet antes de decidir si queréis tirar el dinero. Creo que todavía no está colgado, pero mi amigo lo va a colocar esta semana."
1,Not what I expected,"I don't know what the deal is with the few strange (and innacurate) positive reviews of this album. I don't really care if they're ""outstanding citizens"" or if they're dedicated followers of the ""Revolution effort"", whatever that means. I bought the cd because I'm a huge fan of the Jonestown Massacre, and this isn't in their league."
1,"The Revolution is certainly NOT coming down, but...","...the revoltion sure is coming up! At least while listening to this pretentious, completely derivative, boring mess by the Quarturd After. Jeez, no wonder James F. Rettard loves this cd--his review is as overwrought and inane as this album is. After slogging through this several times, I can honestly say that anyone who gives this this embarrassment more than one star is either brain dead, a friend of the band, or most likely, both."
4,The Revolution Is Coming Down!!!,"I dig the Quarter After live and on record. They are nice outstanding citizens who are dedicated followers of the Revolution effort. If you don't understand, look up the Brian Jonestown Massacre.Too Much to Think About can put you in a trance if you are not careful. It takes you back to 1966 with some Raga-Rock influence. Know Me When I'm Gone is my favorite track on the album. It is modern psychedelia. Dominic's singing is much like Roger McGuinn's. Byrds fans will love the Quarter After. Or any fan of the '60's or good music.Quarter After is authentic and not cheesy. They do not overdo it. Dominic's 12 String Rickenbacker work is great. Good harmonies too by Rob and various personel.These other bad reviews are mockeries."
4,"Solid playing, gorgeous sound, OK songs","Granted, the songs are merely platforms for the instruments. The singing's not spectacular. But these guys can play. What puzzles me is the amount of negative reviews here for this disc. They all sound like they were written by the same person. Either someone's got a grudge against a band member or they're so used to digital ear-bleed masterings that this smooth, luxurious mastering job by a guy named Brad Vance isn't fast-food enough for them. Vance brings out the clang of the Rickenbachers and the snap of the tambourines. You can turn this up without the neighbors calling the cops. It sounds that good. I guess not too many people like real-sounding recordings anymore. As close to analog as you can get with digital. If you have a decent system, give this a try. Wait til you hear that bassist. It sounds like he and the band are in the same room as you. Turn this mother up. It's OK. And then turn it up a little more..."
2,book light,"Good price and reflective of what i got...cheap plastic, low watt light....does the trick,however I wonder how long it will last...not very durable"
3,its good for reading in the night,"The Box Light is ok for reading in somewhat dark ,but not completely dark,its still very hard to read and it isnt that bright so I usually just turn on the light above my bed."
1,Disappointed,"The reason why I am rating this reading light so low is because it only worked for a couple of weeks. It became progressively dimmer during that time frame. Consequently, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and bought new batteries for it. It was difficult to open up to replace the batteries and after I replaced them, it doesn't work at all. Please beware of purchasing this book light for yourself, it was a complete waste of money!"
4,Kingston Trio - Guard Years,Great music. Great recordings. Great pictures and annotations in the LP sized book. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that the numbering on the annotations does not correspond to the CD's.
1,Please put the C back in Christmas,I watched this wanting to see a Christmas movie. Nothing Christmas about it. Happy Winter Holiday - what the heck is that? PC - don't bother to watch.
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"This years Thomas Christmas special is nothing special at all!!!It is no different than last years ""Merry Christmas Wish"".Sir Topham Hatt still dresses up as santa and wishes everyone a ""Merry Winter Holiday""!!!SERIOUSLY????!!!!! The kids looked at me and asked ""when is winter holiday mom??""""Whats up w a beautiful series that was created by a REVERAND now being PC'd out to death!!!!Bring back the old Thomas please, Im just not buyin anymore."
5,A Cute Movie,This movie was cute both my 2 year old and 1 year love it. We have already watched many many times!
1,"Different than ""Merry Winter Wish"" dvd... NOT BETTER! DO NOT BUY!","This ""Merry Christmas, Thomas!"" DVD IS DIFFERENT than last year's ""Merry Winter Wish"" DVD. There are different episodes.This DVD ""Merry Christmas, Thomas"" contains the following episodes:* ""Let It Snow""* ""Surprise, Surprise""* ""Percy and the Snowman""* ""Tree Trouble""While the ""Merry Winter Wish"" contains the following episodes:1. Merry Winter Wish2. Thomas and the Snowman Party3. Henry's Magic Box4. Merry Misty IslandHOWEVER...IT'S STILL THE SAME HORRIBLE ""MERRY WINTER HOLIDAYS"" COMING FROM SIR TOPHAM HATT!! PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE DO NOT BUY. LET'S BOYCOTT THIS HORRIBLE POLITICALLY CORRECT NONSENSE!!!!"
1,Unbearably horrible,"With five young kids, I've seen my share of corny, cheesy, and dumb kiddie videos. This one could be the worst. The ""plots"" are stupid, and the characters talk in bad rhymes and annoying voices. I think my kids IQs dropped 10 points after watching this. We were watching it free with Amazon Prime, turned it off halfway, and willingly dealt with the two year old's protests at the video being turned off, because enduring a toddler tantrum is MUCH preferable to watching this video."
2,Recycled title...,"How is this dvd different from last year's ""Merry Winter Wish""?? I haven't actually seen this one, but it seems like its the exact same episodes, including the one where Sir Topham Hatt dresses as Santa and exclaims ""Happy winter holiday!"" instead of saying ""Merry Christmas!"""
5,my review,"I was pleased with the time frame in which I got the product, very short time. I got this for my granddaughter so cannot comment on the content of it but I have heard no complaints about it.Would do business with the sellar again."
2,Disappointing,We found the CD to be boring and a little annoying. There are better products out there.
3,Battery Charger,"I was not happy with the purchase. I was guaranteed that the battery would work with my camera, that it was compatible. However, it didn't. We placed the battery in the charger and after 36 hours, it still wouldn't charge. It was a waste of money."
1,Broke in a week,"This strap broke pulling out a small bush, I do not think that the weight on the shrub was 30,000lbs but it could have been the super shrub. Oh yeah and the shrub was dead. I used a boat rope and it came right out. so...."
5,A Great Recovery Strap,"If you're looking for a great recovery strap (especially for those who don't know the difference between a recovery strap and a tow strap) you've found it. I've had my 3"" X 30'ft Explorer Pro Comp strap for over 2 years now and aside from some wet mud / clay stains, this strap is still in excellent condition after recovering many other Jeeps on the trails off road. If there is a better recovery strap out there -- I've yet to see it."
1,I would rate zero stars if I could,"Last year, my dog got sprayed by a skunk. At the time, I used a common recipe to clean her up and after a few days, it was okay. Still smelled every time she got wet, but it eventually went away completely.So I found this product at my local pet-store and decided to purchase it in case there was a next time.Well...8 months lator...bam. Happened again, so I was ready. I took the bottle out, followed the instructions and used the whole bottle on the dog. Waited until she dried up...and...an hour lator I got into my car, at 11h30pm, went to the closest late night grocery store, and purchased the common ingredients for the common recipe.Nature's Miracle Skunk Odor Remover did absolutely nothing more than water to the smell. It is completely worthless...dont waste your money on this."
3,"works, just doesn't last long","Our young dog took the hit right in the face. The baking soda/peroxide/dish liquid method works better (lasts longer) but it isn't recommended for the dog's face--where this one is OK. This product is also easier to use as it does not require rinsing (so using it more often isn't unbearable). There's nothing I can do for her eyes or the inside of her mouth (poor pup... hopefully this experience will provide a lasting impression on her and she will forever stay away from the ""pew kitties""). Overall, I would say this product is a good supplement."
3,Helps but not 100%,"Works better than most remedies we tried. We still needed to use ""peroxide/baking soda/dish soap"" remedy in conjunction with this product. Even at that there was still a bit of lingering odor especially when the dog gets damp. Bottom line is it makes the situation a lot more tolerable."
3,Better products available,The product works well on short hair dogs but if you have a rough coat dog there are better products available. This does reduce the smell but it takes about two weeks for the smell to be eliminated. If your expectation is for immediate elimination of the smell on rough coat dogs you would be better suited to look at skunk off.
5,Chris's review on Nature's Miracle Skunk Odor Remover 32oz,Love this stuff. My dog is 140-150 lbs and stinky when sprayed with a skunk. Less than 45 mins and she still smells a little but a ton better!
2,t=shirt,i didn't care for the quality of this shirt. the art on it wasn't very good either. it looked like it was slopped on you could see streaks in it. i was very disappointed with it. i don't recommend buying this product and i personally would never shop from them again.
2,Fair read,"I bought this book in a used bookstore and was glad I didn't pay full price for it. It was a fair read although I thought the characters were somewhat two dimensional, especially the main female character."
4,X-Files meet The Terminator?,A friend described this book to me as X-Files meets The Terminator. That's about right. Usually I don't go for this much gore and violence. But I do like the sort of thing X-Files does when they leave you dangling with mysteries even thouygh they gave you enough to theoretically figure it all out. If you like both blood and guts and that you'll like this even more than I did. That is if you think these things can be crossed. But I think the author did a good job of doing that.
2,mixed feelings,"Another reviewer lent me this book and while I don't quite share his negative feelings, neither am I that impressed. There were some good ideas in here but frankly I came away from the book not really caring about any of the characters. I did think that while some of the characters were interesting, the dialogue was portly and pompous. The female character was not really believable and the most of the characters seemed really two dimensional despite the overblown dialogue. All in all, this was a fair book."
1,Poorly written,"Very poorly written.I read this book a week ago, it was so badly written I couldn't tell you what it was about.Personally I wouldn't rate this book, and am sorry I purchased it."
5,This stuff is awesome!,"I love the smell of this Buddy Splash. Makes my dogs smell like they just got a bath, clean and fresh. My order didn't come with the sprayer as pictured I contacted the seller to see why it didn't come with one."
5,Great lego!,"I bought this toy at target and I love it!Pros: cool mini-figures, great design, roter blades fold up like the real thing, comes with strecher.Cons: roter blades fall off easily if your not careful, after a while the part that connects the two rear landing-gear bends a bit, the winch is tough to wind up.overall, I would recommend this set greatly!"
3,"This is an overpriced lego selection, pick something else, this will end in tears and frustration","The helicopter is cool, but it was a pain to put together, the pieces on this model didn't stay together nicely, or they were not reinforced enough to keep the helicopter together.The propellers are forever falling off, the doors fall off, all the teeny tiny pieces come off. It's a pain to put it back together too.It's a neat idea, I suppose you could glue the whole thing together, but what's the fun in that. Out of all our legos, this is one of the more disappointing."
2,Not one to play with,"I helped my five-year old assemble this, and, like most LEGO directions, it went together well...unfortunately, it doesn't stay together...when he tries to play with it, the tail section falls off or it breaks in the middle...not as easy to put back together once it's come apart...it's proven a real disappointment..."
4,"A bit too many typos, but worth the money anyway.","An ideal reader of this book should have quite some knowledge of table, query, form and report design, but no macro and module design experience. That's when this book is a real eye-opener. It assumes no previous knowledge of VBA and it starts of with basic things--Access and DAO object model, introduction to events, etc. Then, it went on to identifiers(i.e. how do you reference fields, controls, etc), and only THEN it goes on to programming techniques like if..then and other decision structures, a heavy chunk of DAO, a bit of SQL, and some other useful stuff. What's not excusable, however is that this book has some typos not only on the pages, but in the code. Although the mistakes are correctable with some common sence, this has prevented the book from receiving 5 stars from me."
1,Waste of a tree!,This is another example of wasted effort by both author and reader. The reader gets a big thick volume that can be used as a paper weight or door stop. The author came up with a good title that will appeal to many Access knowledge seekers. Too bad the author did not spend more time developing usable examples and step by step instructions that teach VBA/Macros for Access. The VBA sections are very shallow for the size of the book. If you want to learn Access Macros or VBA go to another source. Nobody seems to be able to handle this subject on the 4 or 5 star level. Maybe someday someone will write a book that is useful to the Access programmer who wants to go beyond the simple examples included in most books in print today.
3,"HAS ALOT OF INFOMATION, BUT PRESENTATION COULD BE BETTER","It covers alot of topics , but the details and description did not always flow well. It was in essence, hard to follow due to the book layout. Don't use this if you are planning to learn. It works better as a refernce."
1,utter waste of money,The book is approximately 950 pages of fluff with about 50 pages of possibly useful information. The examples and descriptions are not related and totally unorganized from a learning standpoint.
2,Book Truely Needs Serious Work.,"A typical attempt at explaining Microsoft software. The book passes up the opportunity to present an introduction to ""meat and potatoes"" programming in VBA for the idea that ""The thicker the book the better."" The author & publisher (Sybex) seemed more concerned with typeset and layout than substance and solid presentation of programming VBA for MS Access. ...even this shows a real lack of commentment when Tables that belong in the text appear on the CD-ROM. My honest advice - save your fifty bucks and save another poor tree from having to be abused with such slop."
4,love it.,I work with tuning forks and the medicine of the future is about vibration so a good book for my healing library.
1,does not fit 2007 matrix,The mounting holes fit but the radio placement is about a half inch to the left of where it needs to be in order for it to be centered in the dash panel. DO NOT ORDER THIS FOR A TOYOTA MATRIX.
5,memory,"def improved my averatec c3500's performance... easy to install. great price. unfortunately, my computer's power port went out... so if you need some of this memory.. let me know! i only used it for 4 days!"
5,Old laptop upgrade,Upgraded an old Winbook laptop from 512Mb to 1Gb (the max for this laptop). XP no longer runs very well on only 512Mb memory.The addition of another 512Mb is a significant improvement.
2,not the right memory for my 2568CL,"My Compaq Presario 2568CL needed a slightly different build/version of this memory module, so I needed to return this one unfortunately. But it was very easy and painless to return it and I was fully refunded including shipping both ways. Thanks Amazon!"
1,sorry had to return,"ordered wrong.... if ordering this for dell lap top... even dell site says it is the correct item.. but it is not the Mhz has to be the same...... they dont read backward..... they (dell, crucial web site) tell you it will work... but it dont!!"
1,Didn't even work.,"I chose the 2-day shipping and received it right on time, no problem. Then I tried to use my new RAM upgrade. It was the right size, right number of pins, right density(512) fit perfectly, and didn't do ANYTHING. I had the exact same amount of RAM on my computer as I had before I installed this upgrade. I even used the manufacturer's online tool to find the right one and then found it on amazon to buy. I don't know if it is this is just a problem with this particular upgrade or what but I paid for it and got nothin. Good news is the manufacturer has a lifetime warranty. We'll see what happens. BUYER BEWARE."
3,It doesn't say that I have 1 gb of ram,"I bought one pair of 512 mb sodimm ddr ram. Once I installed the new pair of ram in my laptop( Sony Vaio PCG-K25 ). Then I checked at my computer icon and go to properties. It should say that I have 1024 mb of ram ( minus video card memory) but it didn't say that. It still say that I have only 448 mb of ram ( 512 mb minus 64 mb of video card memory). So, I don't know why??? I tried to do some research about this problem. Some said that's fine. It's just not show that you got 1 gb of ram but I can use 1 gb of ram.. ohhh i still dunno what the problem is."
4,One month in use and so far so good!,I have been using this in my toshiba laptop for about a month and so far so good!
1,Check with your manufacturer!,"I was unable to get these memory modules to work in my computer. Crucial's system scan told me the memory was compatible, but installing them corrupted my system and forced me to re-install my OS (using my old memory modules). I called Crucial and they sent me a different version of the modules, claiming that the slightly different modules would work. They did not. I then contacted my manufacturer who indicated emphatically that the memory is not compatible, and is the cause of my system problems. Crucial then allowed me to return the modules, but made me pay postage to send them back. All this hassle for a product that they guaranteed would work but instead it forced me to reinstall my OS - three times, in the end! I depended on Crucial's reputation and it was a mistake. Before you order this product, check with your manufacturer to make sure they are compatible."
4,1957 to 1967 Columbia Recordings,"This is a whole lot of ""tater"" and is for the true Dickens fan. Bear Family picks up where the previous ""Country Boy"" collection left off. Everything from mid 57 to the end of Little Jimmy's Columbia contract in 1967 is here including ""Hole in my pocket"" a rocker from 58 and, of course, ""May the bird of Paradise fly up your nose"" from 1965 and many many others. He's still kickin' today and going strong in his 80's. Great collection!!"
4,Pleasantly educational despite the editorial shortcomings,"For anyone interested in Chaco and the whole Chaco Phenomenon, this is a very readable place to start -- lots of good, basic information, and the addition of the last chapter updating what came before is particularly worthwhile. The only negative is easily overlooked because of the subject, but the editorial staff should be drawn and quartered for letting a reissue hit the presses with ANY grammatical and/or typo errors -- shame on them, but good for Frazier for updating his book (and his readers) on what's new re Chaco."
5,An excellent overview,"For anyone interested in Chaco--or in 'Anasazi' culture in general--this is a great read. It is highly accessible to the lay reader, compiling the current theories, arguments and evidence in a way that is quite enjoyable. The overview of the historical development of research in the region is excellent. A 'must' for anyone interested in southwestern archaeology."
4,Good book if you've carved a duck before.,"This book is a good book only if you've carved a duck before because it does not tell you what kind of knife to use, also it does not tell you to draw the basic front and back of the duck on the botton as guide lines. If you want to start carving buy the book ""How to carve wood"". It tells you how to carve a antique duck very clear. It also tells you what tools you need, and even how to sharpen them. After you purchase the book how to carve wood, then buy this book carving miniature duck decoys for patterns, and better techniues. Even though carving minauture duck decoys has good techniques it does not explain basic info. Buy the standard B bo-t handcrafted knife from woodcraft.com that is the best knife for basic carving. I hope this review helped."
4,Book Review for Carving Miniature Decoys,Within one week had two miniatures completed. I thought the scale was a bit small so I had the images enlarged 15% and redid the measurements. Will probably do both sizes. Better be able to carve and paint in order to take advantage of this book.
1,Adapter,Didn't work on any keyboard. Since it was so cheap I just binned it. Do buy this product. Can't recommend it
1,Did not work on my computer,I haven't been able to get this adapter to make a connection on my computer. I'm a bit frustrated by this.
1,did not work. period,Did not work on a Lenovo usb keyboard connecting to a Belkin Flip PS/2 KVM switch. Guess it's hit or miss with this adapter. Costs too much to return for credit.
2,Doesn't work with Logitech.,"Not sure what's up, but doesn't work on my computer. I half expected this, but it was worth a shot to try out."
1,No Luck,"This didn't work for plugging my DELL USB keyboard into a TRENDnet TK-205 KVM switch, nor even directly into the PS/2 connector of my DELL Vostro (Windows 7) or older Optiplex (Windows 2000). All this equipment works in other configurations. I have a similar-looking USB to PS/2 mouse adapter by Microsoft that works fine."
2,Mostly Dated Material; Should Be 1/2 As Long,"If you're looking for an exposé against Dave Hunt or Constance Cumby, which I wasn't, then you've come to the right place. Most of the book contains problematic attacks by these two, and is dated to the late 80s. And even then there's way too much. The point could have been made with half the pages. I struggled to get through the whole thing, but finished because usually the Passantinos write quality stuff. The best thing I learned was just to avoid Hunt and Cumby altogether. There are many good counter-cult authors out there, including the Passantinos, such as Walter Martin, Elliot Miller, and Douglas Groothuis.If you're looking for good discernment techniques or the ability to recognize poor analysis, just read the first and last chapters."
5,Great present!,"Charming book about unconditional love that will surely put a smile on your face.A great present, especially for first time Moms expecting a boy."
2,Weird version!!!,"I have this ""board"" book for both of my kids. LOVE this book! Our favorite! The story is so sweet!! I buy this book for all my friends having babies! HOWEVER, i went to purhase it for my 3rd child when she was born and this paperback version is horrible! The wording is different and vicious almost! They speak of the one eyed monster saying how he'd bite off you head or something! Ummmm, this is a child's book, right? And something about shredding the sheets while I sleep! Omg, like kids aren't scared to sleep alone in room as it is. BUT the board book version is SO adorable! Get that one!!!!!"
3,Book wasn't in very good shape,I expected the book to be in better shape. It looked like it was almost ready to be recycled. Guess you really do get what you pay for :).
3,Liked the Board Book Better,"I bought the board book of this when I was expecting my son. I started reading to him before he was born, and we have been reading it everyday for 3 yrs. I saw this one on Amazon and read a review that made me realize that the board book was not the full book, so I had to have this one. Maybe it's because I am so used to it, but I think the board book tells the story perfectly. I love the story of the mom telling her son that she will love him no matter what, I just find the board book version better suited to read to a child."
3,The strength of a mother's love,"My little one seems to think this book is funny because of the reititous ""But Mama, but mama"" but for me I found the story just a tad too long. This is a good book to reassure a child that no matter what, Mommy will love you but for my two year old, this story was a bit wordy (ie: the alligator and the alien)."
5,Cutest Book Ever!,"I bought this book for my 4 year old son for Christmas and it is too cute! It shows the love a mother has for her child, no matter what. He has me read it to him every night. It is definitely a book for a Mama to read to her boy, but would be cute for any kid!"
5,A great book!,"One good book! Children love it (and the parents do too)! It is easy to understand, funny for the kids (they want to read it over and over), with detailed, thoughtful illustrations. This is a ""must-have"", all-around cute book!"
5,Sooo cute!,"I had never heard of this before, but thought the title was funny, so I went on others' reviews. So glad I did - it was hilarious and my 3 year old loves it."
5,must have in collection,"such a cute book, great for infants because it is a hard book, and will last a long time because it is such a cute story line!"
2,NOT A NEW BOOK!,I PURCHASED THIS BOOK FOR $5.99 THINKING I WAS GETTING A BRAND NEW BOOK. THE BOOK IS DEFINITELY NOT NEW AND IS WORN ON THE EDGES AND BINDING. THERE IS NOWHERE IN THE DESCRIPTION THAT STATES IT IS A USED BOOK. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL! WILL BE CAUTIOUS OF ORDERING AGAIN!
5,Best Doggie Shampoo EVER!,I have two dogs with sensitive skin and long hair. This is by far the best shampoo on the market. The product is nice and thick and has a pleasant not overly scented smell. It leaves them clean and with the added benefit of conditioner their fur is soft and not to terribly hard to brush out.
2,Loved the smell... made my dog really itchy and sneezy for a week,"I bathe my 5 month old puppy about once a week. At first, I really liked that this product didn't smell overwhelmingly of baby powder like other shampoos. However, it didn't leave my pup's fur any softer than other plain shampoos (no conditioner) and his fur started looking greasier in a couple days (usually he's fine for the week). Also, I think he had a pretty bad allergic reaction, since he spent an entire day trying to rub his body against everything, then had terrible sniffles for the next week until I bathed him again with his old shampoo. Soo if your dog isn't allergic to this shampoo, it should be fine- not great. Me, I wasted my money."
4,Great Smell,This is one of our favorite shampoo's to use as the smell is very fresh and clean and lingers on his coat for a few days afterwards. Most doggie shampoos smell great initially but don't offer up enough lather or continue smelling fresh...this one is the exception. It's the best one we've tried of all the designer shampoos and it's nicely priced.
3,So-so,"Smells good, but does not last long. My dog will smell like a wet dog after a bath and this product did not improve it."
4,Good shampoo,"I am sure this shampoo will do more than fine for my dog. It leaked a little in the box, but not much. Good shampoo."
1,doggie shampoo,Amazon advertized on their site that original Cloud Star Buddy wash shampoo which is what I thought I was purchasing. Apparently Cloud Star stopped making just doggie shampoo and they combined the original shampoo with a conditioner. The new p[roduct leaves my 4 dogs looking greasy and the fragrance is no longer the same.
5,The best dog shampoo ever!,"Where has this shampoo been for so long???? I love it. Can't get enough of my dogs, I keep sniffing them and touching their coat, they smell great and are so soft to touch. This stuff lathers easy, you don't have to use a lot of it, rinses clean and smells great. I will only use this brand from now on."
5,Love Buddy Wash,I love this gentle dog shampoo. Leaves my two rescue doggies clean and soft. I've researched the ingredients and do not find them to be offensive.
3,it's alright. but,it works but i don't know how well. Im a first time dog owner so i haven't used any other products
2,Not for every dog,"After the first wash my dog was a bit itchier than normal. I dismissed it thinking it was other environmental issues. I washed him again in the morning and he was itching, scratching, chewing, rubbing his face and was in complete discomfort all day. So, while this shampoo works for a lot of dogs, my lab must have sensitive skin. I just washed him again this evening with a different shampoo and he is relaxing, finally."
2,Still waiting....,"I bought a shampoo from the pet store that I don't like much at all for my two new puppies. I was excited to see the great reviews on this product. Unfortunately, I've been waiting 2 weeks to receive it (no fault of Amazon). I'm so disappointed that I have to use the other shampoo again to bath them this weekend. I hope this arrives soon!!!"
2,What's the big deal?,"I really don't know what all the hoopla is about this product. I can barely even smell the scent in the bottle and there's absolutely no trace of the scent on my Chi after having bathed her in it. As far as I'm concerned, this stuff is just plain average and not something I'll buy again. It didn't lather up any better than most other products I've used and my dog's fur is no more soft than it was before her bath. Based on the other reviews, I really expected this to be some sort of super luxurious doggie shampoo, but there's nothing special about it. :("
1,Exploded,"The cap came off during shipment. It was shipped with a sealed bag (I guess to prevent a mess), but the bag had a hole in it. The shampoo got all over the other items in the shipment. I wouldn't recommend buying this online as the product was clearly not designed to be shipped."
4,Good Shampoo,"This is a nice dog shampoo. The ""mint"" description in the title of the shampoo almost turned me off from buying it, but I tried it anyway. The good news is that it is definitely not an overwhelming mint smell. The shampoo left my yorkie smelling fantastic and seemed to do a nice job on his coat. Great value, considering the bottle will last me years."
5,"Great Stuff, and good smelling dog","This shampoo is the best. My Boxer has sensitive skin which has had problems with other ""itch relief"" dog shampoos like oatmeal based shampoos you can get at Target. Buddy Wash does not cause problems for her and even better it smells good."
2,Not As Expected,"My dog and I are disappointed with Buddy Wash. After using it for several baths, I stopped using it as my dog developed severe itching. The itching was NOT caused by under-rinsing. I take special care to ensure all shampoo residue is completely washed away. Even with the conditioner built into the shampoo, my dog's hair was very tangled. I will not purchase the product again and would not be able to recommend it to my family or friends. Sorry!"
5,No more doggie smells,"I just got a new puppy and forgot to buy dog-shampoo. I had to make do with my cheap human shampoo for about 2 washes before this came in the mail. With the human shampoo, my dog would scratch a lot more due to dryer skin. Buddy Wash, however, has cured the dry skin problem and my dog smells better than ever. The shampoo lathers well and smells great. I recommend it!"
4,Not Bad!,"I enjoy this shampoo for my furry child, for it lathers & rinses very well and also leaves her coat soft and shinny but i'm not really into the scent."
5,The best doggie shampoo,"This shampoo is the perfect blend of mild ingredients and a soft, sweet smell. I will be a loyal customer especially since it is reasonably priced to boot!!"
4,Buddy Wash,This product is great especilly paired with Buddy Wash Conditioner! I highly reccommend this product if you are currently using some crappy shampoo.
5,Smells great,"I love this shampoo and conditioner, it smells great and leaves my Papillon super soft. Also the smell lingers on the dog so she continues to smell great."
3,"Decent old movie, not what I expected","Was looking for something more along the lines of the mission. This was a bit more Classic Western style. Not what I expected, but not bad."
5,Captivating,"I read this book travelling in China. I agree with many things the author writes about- especially how Asia is losing its ""old world"" charm due to a obsessive need to advance and that the change is mismanaged and distructive. I also agree that the Chinese are behind most of it. I too am a decendant of migrant Chinese workers now living in a developing country. The conflict between rapid development and preserving the past is one we constantly face.However, I do feel that the author, eventhough he has been living in Asia for decades and is so well travelled, he is still given a perspective of an outsider or (gwai lou- white devil). The reaction of the locals are still greatly influenced by that."
3,"More travel, less self reflection","I am an avid fan of travel narratives and thought this would show me a side of Asia seldom written about. While he did show me some of its traditions and ways, it was hard to filter that through his self journey to find someone to confirm what the astrologer said. I also tired of his opinions, his assumptions, and his inability to see things in other than black and white. But the book was interesting once you get passed all that, and hd is a good writer, so I'll call this average. But its one I'd recommend with reservations."
5,a thought-provoking book,"Having just returned from the Asian countries of Tiziano's travels, I found his book fascinating. It delves into each country's spiritual philosophy and political history, while relating his personal experiences in these changing cultures. The fortune teller theme was very apropos: we had a guide leave our tour because it had been foretold by a fortune teller that the only propitious time to move his household during 2006 was between 8 and 9am on Jan. 18. What? That experience, and others, reaffirmed many of Tiziano's musings. Through his perspective, obviously honed by his journalistic career and personal beliefs, we see the effects of modernity on these countries, thus prompting us to reflect on our own country's gains and losses as we attempt to bring change to deeply-held belief systems in other parts of the world. This book gave me much to think about."
