3,Cute little dollhouse!!,"I just purchased this dollhouse for my daughter, and she loves it. It's very compact, and she can take it anywhere. The only problem with it is the figures that come with it are way too big for the accessories that go with this house. They should either make the dollhouse a little bigger or make the figures a little smaller."
3,"Nice, but not durable","The Hello Kitty house was great at the beginning. My daughters loved it, and played with it quite a lot. The lights started malfunctioning soon after purchase. The door broke off within the first six months. Even though my kids loved the doll characters, they got bored with them soon after, because they had no moving parts, and were a hard inflexible plastic. The furniture was cheaply made, and didn't stand up to my daughters play for more than a year."
3,"Cute, but Tiny","This little house is very cute, but it's very small. There's not much room, even for tiny fingers, to set up the furniture in the rooms. My almost 3-year old daughter loves Hello Kitty, so this was a cute addition to her growing collection, despite its size."
5,Addicting and Fabulous!,"Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles is a great anime. I love how you learn more about the characters as you go further into the story, and some adorable scenes occur between Syaoran and Sakura. The music flows well throughout the anime and adds some emotion into the scenes. They have great cliff hangers too, so be prepared to be hooked on this anime. I've watched through this series a couple of times, and have finally bought it. I shall continue to enjoy this anime again and again."
5,Simple but effective,"This book is one of the early books on origami and written by 2 American legends who lead origami in USA and started the rise in origami and the popularity origami currently enjoy.This book contains a lot of simple models, easily folded by beginners. The models folded has a lot of practical applications. In general, if you use the correct colours in folding the model, you can get a really effective and eye catching model.There is section on Christmas decorations which I use even today. Use bright shiny paper and hang up the origami decorations on your Christmas tree and listen to the ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" of kids as they admire the decorations. The decorations come in many shapes and often require more than a piece of paper to fold. This is a blessing since this allows you to control the colour of the model. They are usually very easy to fold although assembling it could present a challenge to begineers.An excellent book for begineers keen to fold their own decorations."
5,Heartbreaking and beautiful,"Cary Brothers is an excellent musician and songwriter, and in ""All the Rage"", he really showcases his talent. I saw him play live in a small indie record store before I even got to hear the EP. I wasn't all that familiar with him but I really like his song, ""Blue Eyes"" from Garden State. So to say the least, when I saw him perform a mini-concert for the 10 or so people in the store, I was more than impressed, and from that point on I became a fan. I also got to meet him for a few minutes after the show. He was very down-to-earth and seemed humble. For the most part, his songs sound mello and dreamy. A few of his songs boast heartwrenching melodies, especially ""Something"" which is particulary haunting, and is comparable to ""Blue Eyes"" if not better. I can't wait until the LP comes out, which he said should come out in this month of August."
5,Simply amazing,"I first heard Cary Brother's ""Blue Eyes"" from the Garden State soundtrack, which quotes on the cover ""You gotta hear these songs, they will change your life I promise you."" That's definitely a promise kept. Cary Brothers is an amazing and talented singer-songwriter. His songs are sincere, heartfelt, and simply beautiful. ""All the Rage"" is a stunning four-track EP about the different emotions of finding and losing love. It's how real music should be: the ability to touch your soul and stir your innermost emotions. I also saw him perform live and if it is even possible, he sounds even better live than his recordings. I absolutely love this EP. Highly recommended."
5,Cary brothers is great,"I brought this cd a few weeks ago, I love it. I heard about the song ""blue eyes"" from the movie garden state. I cant wait to hear more songs from him. I hope he comes near Iowa, so I can see him live. I hear he is great live. buy this cd, you will enjoy it as much as I have."
3,"Too Few Songs, Too Much Money","I Paid $9 for this CD, and while it is a good cd, there are only 3 songs on it for a total of 14 minutes of listening pleasure. I find this to be a rip off. Do yourself a favor and buy a longer CD for the money."
3,Interesting but not very durable,"The generator was fairly easy to assembly, but put out very little voltage. It was very hard to light the supplied LED by hand cranking. An incandescent bulb would have been easier to light. An LED requires over 0.7 volts to dimly activate, I only measured about 1.2V at the fastest crank speed attainable. The crank broke after about 10 minutes of trying to light the LED. My son had more fun hooking up a 9V battery to the generator and letting it spin the crank. The motor was very difficult to assemble. I had to rewind the stator several times to get wiring correct. Not much response from the batteries. While an interesting experiment, my son learned more about gears and using motors than the physics behind how they work."
3,Motor worked. Generator Didn't. Picture Shows four Items but you only get two,I ordered this product to teach electromagnetic concepts to my eight year old. The picture shows four items but the product only has a motor and a generator. This seems misleading to me. They should not show four items in the picture.Motor parts were relatively well designed and easy to assemble and worked great. The generator was not so good. Generator motor's wire was glued flimsily and one of them had partially come off. The other came off during the assembly. I reattached the wire and assembled the generator but could never get it to work.
3,"Not bad, but pretty frustrating","This kit was fun as a father-son project for my seven year old son and I. The motor was tough to build, a lot of winding of wire required, so it ends up being something Dad has to mostly do himself. Overall, the motor building is too hard for even a relatively skillful 7-year-old.The generator is based around a pre-built motor, which should generate a current if you drive it with the crank. We never could get enough current out of the generator to drive the motor or even to light the light. I know it was wired up correctly, because when we applied the batteries to it the crank spun like mad."
2,thought it was great! its not,Fixed up my garage as a playroom and needed a portable baseboard type heater that would heat the space. The first couple of times I used it I was so happy. It used to heat the garage up in about 30 mins to a toasty 67 degrees. The only thing at first that i wasnt happy with was a weird smell that came off it. Now... after three months and maybe just ten uses it is like it doesnt work at all anymore. But there also is no smell. I am so upset. I am going to try to return it.
3,"Heater is ok, but not fantastic","The heater arrived with one foot cracked, but it still stands fine, so we didn't worry about it. It seems to work ok. No worse than any other heater we've had, but not exceptional. Not a powerhouse on heat, but ok. It is very quiet, so that's a strong point in it's favor."
3,Dorian Silk penetrates the KGB to root out a Soviet spy,"A KGB mole is burrowing into England's MI5, and super sleuth Dorian Silk is just the man to stop him!More than one person feels that authors Simon Harvester writes like Alistar MacLean. Perhaps. I picked this 1970 book up from a discount mail-order house in the mid-80's when the Cold War was in full bloom. Not being a big fan of novels, I breezed through it fairly easily. I tried to find something out about Simon Harvester, and learned that he wrote several books in the ""road"" series. Too bad I don't know more about him."
2,bad aftertaste,"I'm a true believer that zinc lessens the duration of your cold. Apparently my favorite lozenges are no longer available so I decided to try this product. I'm sure they are plenty effective but they leave a bitter, nasty aftertaste in your mouth for a very long time."
5,Cute story!,"I picked this book up at the library today while helping my kidlets choose their books. This is a great book to read and remember what it was like to be a child. I really enjoyed the story and the main character, Josh, was wonderful. It was a great, quick afternoon read and one I would have loved to read as a child."
5,SPOOKTACULAR!,"This was a really fun and spooky ghost story. I loved when the ghost appeared. He was a great character and his history added a rich backstory to the mystery. The ending was really exciting, too. And I also loved the subplot focusing on the plight of abandoned animals. GREAT BOOK!!!"
5,Really good spooky mystery book,"I read this book as a volunteer who listens to kids' reviews in a book contest at an elementary school. This was a great book, the author made it an engaging read from the start. Mystery,suspense, and lots of thought provoking dilemmas for kids to ponder!Great as a read aloud for parent's to share with children,especially for halloween!Really young ones might find it a bit scary,but for upper elementary it should be fine. I've read other books from this author and she's wonderful,never a dissappointing read!"
2,Faulty dimmer switch,"Beautiful lamp. But, mine came with a faulty dimmer switch for the smaller lamp. I'm still trying to find a replacement."
3,"Everything in the title, and unabashed populism to boot!","This is probably the more well-rounded of the two volumes of Bangs' articles and miscellaneous whatnot now available. The big issue I've been having with it is that it was clearly designed as an entry point for curious parties. ""Main Lines"" avoids being too obscure if it can help it - even Captain Beefheart seems to me part of the Popular Music Canon - and the pieces here are far more watered-down than the ones in ""Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung."" What I mean by that is that, aside from Bangs' juvenalia (which is briefly touched on at the beginning of the book), this book lacks much of the spirit of discovery that was so beautifully brought to the fore in the first. If you're a Bangs fan or a voracious reader of musical criticism, it wouldn't hurt to read this... but if you're new to Bangs and want to know why he's one of the best music journalists of all time, you should pick up ""Psychotic Reactions."""
4,Best by Spider?,"Mindkiller, although great, is not Spider's best book.Time Pressure is his best so far.Very early in the story the reader has the feeling of sitting across the kitchen table while Spider tells the tale, friend to friend. There are some scenes I could do without but, the ending made the hair on the back of my neck try to run away. Enjoy."
4,The Best of Spider,"Inventive, well paced, and relevant. If you are a Spider fan coming from his Callahan novels, you may not like this much. If you are looking for the best book Spider has ever produced, then this is the one."
4,A science fiction mystery novel set in Canada.,"This is one of those sci-fi books that isn't overtly about futuristic hardware, but rather is set in the not-so-distant future and concerns amplified versions of germane social issues from today. As a result, the character development and social aspects of the plot are more prominently featured. Due to its slow start, I was worried that this book might not pass my 100-page test (in which I abandon a book after 100 pages if I am not into it), but I found it slowly growing on me until I was committed to finding out what happened in the end. The ending has a nice twist to boot."
5,Strong Text of Applied Theory,"Terrific review of how to design and execute quality surveys from some of the most respected names in market research. I bought six copies for the executive team - I can't think of a stronger endorsement. - David Haynes, CEO Western Wats"
1,Good for academics not real world,I got this book upon recommendation from a colleague who is a statistician. But I'm not a statistician so there is lots of formulas and not any real world examples that I could understand.I had taken may be one or two courses in college about Statistics. This book didn't make any sense to me.
5,"""The Pox on both your houses""","A book that is timely in consideration of the current crisis. Well documented and microbiology majors will appreciate all the WHO accounts. It is understandable even by a layman and is a book of warning. This dreaded disease is one of the worst to be faced by humanity and the book delves into the terrible history and the valiant fight to eradicate it. The folly of course, is that it is a political weapon of terror and nations violated obligations to ""preserve"" specimens for war use. This brings us to the dangers of today and how rogue nations might unleash this plague again where it could have a ""doubling"" effect in that many have ancient vaccinations that have worn out and others that have never known the disease are therefore prime meat for infection. A gripping account and well worth the read."
4,Interesting and Informative,"Ok, so I'm on a Disease kick right now. After reading ""The Hot Zone"" and ""Virus Hunter"" I moved on to ""Scourge: the once and future threat of smallpox."" Quite and interesting read, this last book proved to be. The author is extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter and manages to keep the reader engaged for well over 200 pages.The one thing these three books have in common, and the one feature I could do without is the ""modeling"" that come in the last chapter. This is where the author models the outbreak of some disease (in this case smallpox, go figure) to show the reader how unprepared we are, and how virulent the disease actually is. Although it was quaint in the first book, by the third it is tired.Aside from that, I would encourage anyone with a passing interest in infectious disease or bioterrorism to take a closer look at ""Scourge."""
2,Half-Good,"I was really hoping that it would focus more on the ""Once"" rather than the ""Future"", but I was sadly disappointed. Although there were a few choice morsels detailing the suffering that smallpox has caused to people in the past, and the history of inocculation was also quite interesting, most of the book discussed the long (and rather boring) history of the global eradication of the disease, and the current dilemma with smallpox virus samples being stored in various locations around the world. I mean, it's not like those topics aren't interesting... but they cannot compare with the horrific, wince-inducing facts about the illness itself."
5,Carly's number 1 record,"Carly was at her peek in 1978,even though the following year her ""Spy"" album had some of her best work ,(""Were So close,Pure Sin,)""but ""Boys in the Trees"" is her Masterpiece.I can't think of one song thats a filler.""You Belong to Me,"" is still played on the radio every day.I just can't understand why Elektra didn't put out more singles.""Melt my heart,"" would have been a fantastic second single,also""You're the one"" and ""One Man Women."" ( James Taylor wrote and duets with Carly on this song)This was my first Carly Simon album.I had to get all of her records after playing ""Boys in the Trees.""If anyone wants to hear this artist at her peek,This Is It!!!"
4,De Bat Is De Good,"I have been on a quest to get all of Carly's old albums on CD, and the collection keeps going up with this latest addition.The first CD I bought of hers when I decided I loved her was 1975's Playing Possum and it has still been my favorite, followed closely by 1979's Spy and 1974's Hotcakes, but running around in there would be this 1978 effort which featured her hit ""You Belong To Me"" - a Michael McDonald co-write which brought her back to the top 10.The rest of the album is just as clever and meaningful as anything she had done before, probably her last collaboration with James Taylor as they would divorce a few years later, Boys In The Trees contains their duet ""Devoted To You"" (an old 60's Everly Brothers song), and a hilarious Jamaiccan reggae thing called ""De Bat (Fly In Me Face)"", and some other little gems. If you're looking for classic Carly, this is one to get your hands on."
5,A complete LP,"This recording with James Taylor is a complete LP not just a 45 with a bunch of unrelated filler songs.While others characterize it as folk rock or pop rock, I hear a bit folk and dance that was so popular at the time.Anyway, great voice, good listen start to finish both sides, definitely some catchy tunes.I picked this up as used mint Vinyl and I'm glad I did."
5,"More Songs From A Egocentric, Self Absorbed Ex Percodan Addict!!!!","Once again we have the usual acoustic guitars on your typical Carly Simon Album. This lady seems to sing ad infinitum and ad naseaum about two Themes namely (1) Good Loving Gone Bad and (2) How great she thinks she is in bed.There is a stupid song about some bat flying into somebody's face and another song called ""Tranqillo"" (melt my heart) which should be called ""Tequila , melt my brain."" No doubt this CD will be eagerly sought by Ms. Simon's many fans who are just as self absorbed and egocentric as she is.I give this album 5 stars because Ms. Simon has forged a successful career on her album covers alone."
5,It's a White Tommorrow! Rocket Gang,"This is a great CD that satrs everyone's favorite villains, Rocket Gang! There's a few pictures that come with it showing you what Mondo looks like, and there's also a few bonus songs on the CD. This describes the tale of Mondo, who helps the Rockets after they blast off. He sounds hyper... anyway, he trades his Ditto for Meowth, and before long J&J get into trouble when they're attacked by Beedrills. Ditto is overeager, and he always transforms wrong, so he can't help them. Meowth saves them, and they trade Ditto back to Mondo."
3,interesting food for thought,"Though the book is hopelessly outdated and the author clearly does not write for people outside of academic and sociological circles, Pepper does come up with some unique insights about street performers and improptu theater. I definitely saw Washington Square Park differently after reading this."
1,Overwraught and inconsistent,"I tried so hard to enjoy this book, but was unable to forgive the author for pretentious overanalysis of street performance. Harrison -Pepper ignores the more juicy issues of class and economics to give us yet another pedantic discourse on the virtues of breaking down the fourth wall."
2,The Greatest Book in An Excellent Format With Bad Binding,"I love the type, the text, and the format, but the binding needs more longevity. I took exemplary care of my copy, and the book pages still detached from the cover."
4,good dvd,I like this DVD. It is very good. I love Aaron's voice and the acoustic style. I would recommend it to others.
4,Great DVD but,this is a great dvd im a huge staind fan and the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because maybe im too picky but the dvd is so clear that you can hear the fingers sliding on the bass and guitars which gets a little annoying after a while but im a musician and i do realize that that happens but they could have tuned it out on the production of the dvd other than that great must buy
5,Aaron Rocks!,"This DVD is awesome! Aaron Lewis at his best. Upclose and personal. If you love Staind, you will LOVE this one. Its the best of the best."
2,Not happy,Bought this about a month ago. It barely worked. Too scratched up. Dissappointed. It didnt play all the way through.
1,Warning : this DVD is censored,"I feel ripped off and am so angry right now. I can not believe the idiotic censorship on this DVD. The word ""$hit"" is blanked out of the performance of Mudshovel basically ruining it. And to show how idiotic and senseless this censorship is you can see the word spelled out for all the world to see on the subtitles!!! It gives you that same feeling as when you are watching a good R rated movie on TV and its all hacked up with blanked out dialog. There is no disclosure that the video has been hacked in the description by Amazon. Avoid buying MTV products unless you are an 11 year old's mother."
4,"A True Story for Us All, Here and Hereafter","I appreciate this woman writing about a love relationship continuing beyond death. I believe this can be real for everybody, if it's desired with someone. It gives me hope that it will be true for me. Joy Mitchell makes sense!"
2,What a disappointment!,"I loved the earlier book! I had no clue until I had finished that it was a male writer, given that it was such an adorable female protagonist. This novel was full of mysogynistic diatribe...potential female rape victims being the agressor... Women in this day and age taking control of men's lives... Seriously. It was such a lovely cozy series, I don't know what got up the author's nose, but much as I like his characters, I can no longer believe them. Seriously, Alan Cook, come out and say what you have to say,on your own terms, and then write another Lillian Morgan cozy. Leave your awful politics out of it. I'm a woman of a certain age and your/ her diatribes do not ring true."
5,This will beat you woofers apart.,This is a must buy. i love all bass mekanik cd this is for your bass head and competitions. you cant go wrong with this cd.
3,He's coasting,"This is more of the same from Cymbala. What was so stirring to read in Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire now seems like Greatest Hits, Vol. III or more. There's nothing bad or unscriptural here, but the only fresh material here is the stories of his church members' deliverance. A big disappointment."
4,Not Jim's Best,"I absolutely love Jim Cymbala and all that he has done for this world. I have read all of his books, and consider several of them to be my all time favorites.However, if I am to write an honest review then I must admit that this is not his best book.I would recommend instead that you look into his earler work: ""Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire"".Both are about prayer and its influence in our life. Yet ""FW,FF"" is much more personal, filled with personal stories and humbling insight."
1,Not Worth the Frustration,"I ordered this right after Christmas. So far it has arrived broken, twice. The packing is inadequate at best."
1,Portmeirion Christmas Casserole,Casserole arrived broken. Smaller box should have had more padding inside. Now you're out of stock so I can't get another one.
1,A bad textbook if I ever saw one,"This publisher and series of books are mediocre at best- course 3 wasn't all that bad.However, this book is an insult. First, it assumes the reader has the intelligence of pudding. Everything is repeated constantly and one finds themself screaming at the book because of repeated, and often useless methods.That, alone, wouldn't be so bad.Never is a concept explained before several problems of frustration and pain. After that, the author assumes you didn't get it or didn't even read the explanation- even on the simplest of concepts!This constant annoyance disenfranchises students from the wonderful world of math. At all costs, avoid this book."
5,Beautiful selection of solo harp music.,"As a beginning harp student, I collect CDs to learn about technique and the music that is available to play on the harp. This CD was a ""I guess I'll buy it"" because I had never heard of the artist. I have played it continually since it arrived! Wonderful selection of classical music for solo harp -- beautiful background music or to enjoy anytime you want to get away from the loud noise that attacks the ears on a daily basis. I use this when I am getting ready in the morning, as I drive to work, while I am at work to stay and sane at at bedtime to relax before sleeping. Highly recommend!!"
4,its pretty good for an old school anime,"i was kinda skeptical about buying this anime, but since it was so cheap i decided to go with it. the animation is pretty old school, but the story is actually kinda interesting. it turned out to be actually kinda gory(which i love) so i ended up enjoying this anime :) i would recommend it if you're into old school animes, but if you're into the newer stuff you might be kinda picky with this one."
1,This is a dream.,"just fell asleep. this is what ""the judge"" did to me. this movie has okay animation, but *R E A L L Y* bad story."
3,Does the job,"I just put mine together yesterday and it was fairly frustrating. You don't need any tools but you need some coordination. I didn't even really need instructions, it was just common sense that the shelves would fit the way that they do but like I said, it was frustrating because they would constantly collapse while I was putting it together. Once i got it put together it was ok. I would prefer to buy a less frustrating product in the future but this one does the job for what I needed it to do."
1,Impossible to put together.,"Seven years in college and I can't put this poorly designed, came with no instructions, piece of trash together. The photo is misleading. It gives the impression that it's much taller than it is. (Yes, I know it states measurments - but the picture still creates an illusion.) Save yourself frustration - and don't buy. If anyone has any assembly tips, I sure want to hear them."
4,Great for the price!,"I paid less than 10 bucks for this cart and for the price think it's a great deal. It was pretty easy to put together (used wire tires to hold it); it's small, fits in the space and holds a lot for the size. I actually am using it for dozens of ribbon spools; they fit in the spaces in the baskets. It works well for my purposes."
2,small small,the cart was too small for the purpose that i needed it for. it looked real good in the photo but when i put it together the baskets were too small
1,Waste of time and money,This will be sent back.. Impossible to put together and is a lot smaller than we thought..would not recommend a waste of time and money!!
3,Have some duct tape handy,"Nearly impossible to put together without some handy duct tape to hold the shelves in place as you're trying to assemble it. Once assembled, not a bad little cart, but definitely not well made. Wouldn't trust it to hold anything breakable."
3,Exactly what I needed,"This cart is a little flimsy. If you are looking for something sturdy, this is not it. But it holds what I need and fits perfectly where I wanted it."
4,"Household Cart, White",The Household Cart is just what I needed for the space in my laundry area. I would have given it four stars if it had been four shelves.
1,I wish they had negative stars,"Two people, duct tape and a force of will is the ONLY thing that helped in putting this junky little thing together. It is smaller than you'd think, and less stable than it should be. Do not waste your money. I ignored the other comments because I thought people were being a little harsh and too picky. Turns out they were being kinder than they should have been. This is a horrid waste of your money."
1,poor design,"Broke before we even used it. flimsy.... wouldnt buy it again, going to costco and spending $40 on a good one"
1,not as pictured,"Wish I'd read the reviews before I ordered. The item was not as pictured and also too narrow. Somehow it didn't register how small 8"" is--- the width of a piece of paper! Definitely too narrow for my purposes. All 3 are going back!"
3,Very small but convenient.,"I appreciated the ease of opening but when putting it together the sides of the shelves tend to pull inward so it looks a little wonky, and its hard to put together without two sets of strong hands. In fact, putting the shelves on at first it looks as if it will collapse then is very sturdy but the white paint gets all scratched up when you put the last shelf on. I like it, but would not buy again."
2,Cart,"This cart is very difficult to put together. The sides need to be stabilized so you can fit the shelves in them, which is no easy task. I finally had to ask someone to assist me in putting it together."
1,Junk,This does not even deserve one star. It is an absolute nightmare to put together and falls apart if you move it an inch that is if you ever manage to get it to stand on its own. I have given up after multiple attempts and will be returning it. Cannot believe a company would be allowed sell this. Made in China of course.
1,Very hard to put together and needs reinforcement,This is really hard to put together. I had to supplement it with 12 cable ties to make sure that the shelves don't pop off during usage. I should have read the reviews when I was buying this....
1,NOT QUITE WHAT I WANTED,"I anticipated more than I got. The unit is so flimsy and so so shoddily designed, I would recommend staying away from this. I snapped one of the wires that holds this thing together while assembling--it it so unsteady I cannot even put a box of Kleenex on it without this dumb thing falling apart. A waste of time and money!"
3,Tale of two deals,I ordered two of these. One came and we ordered it for a pantry and I guess for the price we were satisfied. Now the second one came and two of the ends were not properly welded or attched however they do it which made them unusable. Not a good deal. Ok if not damaged on arrival.
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"This cart was inexpensive, easy to put together, and has held up well in its month of use. I use this as a storage area next to my washing machine and it has been exactly what I was looking for so far."
1,Not the best cart...,The cart is too small and incredible painful to put together. It was a waste of $24.
1,SIDE CART,"Good luck putting this thing together. It's a piece of garbage - wobbly, cheap plastic, no instructions to speak of either."
3,Not easy to assemble,This serves it purpose as it fits into a small space and provide enough storage space. The only issue I faced was with assembling this product.
1,Poor quality,I am surprised that Amazon would carry suck a poor quality product like this cart. It is very flimsy and unstable. This product makes me reluctant to order from Amazon in the future.
3,"Cheaply made, but does the job!","I have a gap between my kitchen cabinet and the wall (No idea what the builder was thinking!!) and this was the only cart or shelf I could find that fit the opening. I bought it despite some negative reviews, and found it fine for my needs.It fits this otherwise useless space, and is very handy. I keep dish towels on the top shelf, foil, plastic wrap and baggies on the second, and cleaning supplies on the bottom. I'm very happy with the purchase, especially at this price.Negatives - It is cheaply made, low gauge wire. I would not use it for a trampoline. My son likes to push it like a shopping cart, but it's so narrow that it falls over when he turns a corner. I discourage this activity, but there may be some malicious enticement going on, because he does it again whenever my back is turned. Not a good children's toy, but a great way to turn a bit of wasted space into useful storage."
4,Trite but better than most.,"Sounding like a complete different artist than her first cd, it's a pleasant, well-producted pop album. Would I have bought this if I hadn't heard her first cd? No.The little bit of harp on the cd makes one wish for more of the first. These cute pop songs are beneath her; she can do better. Let's hope she does on the next cd."
4,"Tiny voice, Big heart","I first heard Emer Kenny when she sang Parting Glass. It is a haunting song and her interpretation of it resulted in my interest in hearing more from her. I was not disappointed when listened to her album Fades into Day. I don't know if her voice would carry without a mike, but, no matter, her breathy interpretations of her own songs and those written by others are wonderful to hear.It was easy to imagine her voice as if she were whispering to me in an intimate conversation late at night. I think I'm in love.Fades into DayParting Glass"
2,Worth a listen.,"This album's worth a listen - the problem is, it isn't worth more than one. Usually I don't bother too much about the lyrics, but on ""Fades into Day"", it's unavoidable to notice how genuinly trite and shockingly naive, blatant and oversentimental they are. When I got the CD and just read a few lines from the songs before listening to them, well, I actually wasn't really interested in the music itself anymore. As for the music: a little outdated electronica (not cool or hip at all) with average vocals, and a quite good backing band. The main problem with this album is: it is simply uninteresting."
2,Not worth the price,"Bought the product had it die two months later. I think the motor quit on me. It didn't burn out since it had plenty of water. For the price its worth the risk of getting a bad one, but I recommend keeping the sellers info just in case the same things happens to yours that happened to mine"
1,Warning,"A word to the wise: check out this company's track record last Christmas. There were many of us who ordered this item, were told it would arrive on time, only to end up empty handed with every excuse in the book ranging from ""Fire in the Warehouse"" to ""ordered after deadline.""Shame on Amazon for still doing business with this vendor."
4,Fountain,"This review is based upon the service from the company, not the item. The item was not as I expected and I advised the company. They were very accomodating in refunding my purchase price and shipping. Although I was not pleased with the item, I was pleased with the prompt service I received."
1,Looks good until it leaks,"This item was a gift. Thought it looked really different. I kind of liked the idea that it ran on batteries so you didn't see the cord and could really put it anywhere. But, not long after I turned it on and had placed it on a wooden table, I had noticed there was water on the table/water stain... Thought I filled it too much ect. Tried again and again, but always leaks.. So it just sits on the spot where it left a water stain with out running or water in it... Perhaps mine was defective?? Looked cool when it seemed to work. (until it leaked)"
3,Nice but unreliable,"I really liked this fountain, the combination of water and fire - but it has no cord so has to run on batteries, which is a downer. More importantly, it died after a couple of months. I've had other desktop fountains which cost the same or less which have run for years."
3,Motormouth,"I received this fountain as a gift for Christmas. It is a beautiful accent piece for any room, with polished river rocks and four votive candles that set a soothing light. I like that it doesn't come with a cord, but operates on battery power. Therefore, you can set the fountain anywhere.However, I don't use it as a fountain because the motor is so loud on my unit that I can't hear a trickle of water unless I put my ear right up to it and really concentrate. It's too bad, because the unit is even more beautiful with the water running and the candles lit. I just can't stand the sound! Don't the manufacturers even test these products to determine if they work properly? I'm sure that none of the makers of this product have one running at their home. The sound would drive anyone mad!"
2,I don't hear the water trickle,"If you are buying this product for looks, then do so. If you are buying it to hear the trickle of water gently going down the fountain, don't buy it. You only hear a little hum of the motor(very tiny sound). It is very attractive but the motor may not be strong enough to produce the trickle effect."
3,Portraits: Best of Amanda McBroom,"Having seen her in Adelaide the songs have greater impact than they may if you had not seen her. Diction is fantastic and some of her materials are beautiful. I prefer her version of ""The Rose"" better than Bette Midler. Given she wrote the song that is possibly why."
5,A great Pokemon CD!,"This great CD has lots of background music from the Japanese series of Pokemon, as well as the opening theme music. Even if you can`t understand the strange inserts between each snippet, you will be able to recognise a lot because some BGM is also used in the US version of the cartoon, like the Team Rocket theme and Pokemon Battle music. This CD also comes with some stickers and a storybook (all in Japanese, but presented really well). These nice extras add up to what is a great little package! Even if you can`t speak Japanese, if you like Pokemon music you must buy this CD!"
5,This album ROCKS!!!,"OK... I want to but this *so I'm begging* but I've heard this before. THE ALBUM ROCKS! I saw that there were 32 BGM trax and a book with stickies. A must-buy (although I don't have it, ...)"
5,Toblerone Milk Chocolate,Toblerone has always been known as a quality product because it is made from the best chocolate. I have enjoyed this timeless product since I was a child and highly recommend it.
3,BE WARNED: You will NOT get this in a GIFT BOX.,"THIS IS INCORRECTLY LABELED and PICTURED: It SAYS and SHOWS a Very Pretty GIFT BOX for the 12 Toblerone bars. The package I got was a plain warehouse/Costco box of 12 bars. No red ribbon, no neat Octoganal shape, just a plain Toblerone box. This is NOT A GIFT ITEM as I had intended when I made this purchase --- I could have done this purchase at my local Costco. Amazon needs to FIX THE LABEL AND THE PHOTO before they have other customers disappointed in their mistaken purchase. [...BUT on a GOOD NOTE: This is Definitely NOT an expired product (as some other customers have complained about Other Amazon Grocery items). I checked the expiration on the ones I received, and greatfully, it says October of Next Year 2008] ---- Plus you can't beat the great price using their coupon for $25 on $60 Kraft orders right now."
1,"Old Product, Bars are opened and bloomed.","I just received my order of these Toblerone Swiss Milk Chocolate bars sold by ""TheNewMall."" The condition of these bars is ATROCIOUS. They are so OLD it seems the glue from the yellow packaging does not seal them any more and they are opened. Some of the bars are also BROKEN, and you can see the chocolate inside has BLOOMED (a moldy-looking white coating that appears on the surface)."
3,"I Liked It, but Preferred the Precursor Book","Tea with a Black Dragon. Much better in my opinion. I read both of these books about 20 years ago, and was not disappointed with my re-read of the Dragon. However I remembered too late I was disappointed in the sequel. For me, personally, it was too much about the music mileau.One thing I regret is that Ruth doesn't explain the reality behind the mysterious happenings either logically or mystically. I'd like to know why and how, not just who and when in the 'mystic' of it all."
2,Disappointing sequel,Tea with the Black Dragon was a wonderfully subtle book. This sequel gets lost in it's own meanderings. A disappointing work from one of my favorite authors. (Actually the only book of her's that I have ever been disappointed with!)
1,False Advertisement,"Buyer beware. This item is being advertised as a Creative Xfi card and to be honest, it is NOT an xfi. xfi? No. Audigy? Yup.FRAUD"
3,Inexpensive and works well,I needed an inexpensive PCI (not PCI-X) audio card with well supported linux drivers. This one was fine. Ubuntu 8.10 automatically recognized and installed the right drivers on reboot after physically putting the card in the slot.
5,The new one is Vista Compatible,"I have the new SB soundcard with the exact same part number as the one sold here. I purchased it from Dell for approximately the same price. I notice the box on mine has a Vista sticker about 3 inches high on the upper right corner of the box, whereas the box pictured here does not. Amazon, you need to upgrade the picture. Anyway, my card works correctly with all included drivers and software and does a beautiful job of correctly using all the X-Fi modes to enhance sounds, including Crystalizer, EAX and CMSS 3D. There are no glitches in the operation of this card. So it would seem some of you got the early version of this card without Vista certification."
1,Not a true X-Fi card,"As noted in a previous review, this card doesn't exactly belong in the X-Fi series (it is NOT the same as the Xtreme Music sound card). The odd thing is that I bought one of these off the same Amazon page from a non-Amazon seller and it is an X-Fi Xtreme Music card. Since I was looking for a sound card specifically with music creation capability in mind, the Amazon card is being returned. Thumbs down for Creative's marketing of this product. Moral: make sure you read the fine print!"
1,Not happy with Creative.,"Marketing this as an X-FI card is dishonest. The card itself, and the included software, work very well in windows XP and is all I need for my uses but marketing an audigy chip under the x-fi name has made me very dissapointed with creative."
3,Not Vista ready,"This card works in Vista if you download the Vista driver from Creative's website; however, none of the Creative applications work at all. I expect that this will be fixed in the future but who knows how long that will take.The Digital I/O module is a good add-on. See my review there for installation instructions."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CARD IF YOU ARE USING VISTA - PERIOD,"Just bought this card as an upgrade. The sound quality is significantly better than what my motherboard offers. The software comes with the card doesn't really works with Vista, at least for my case, Vista Ultimate 64bit. I have to go online and download about 100MB of updates to get the driver, player and the audio console to work.I'm very disappointed that the console launcher, which is the equalizer and sound effect control, is not working. I can't believe this $50 plus sound card doesn't have a WORKING EQ.UPDATE: I just did a little research on Creative's website, and I notice they are SELLING X-Fi driver/apps CD for Vista. Unfortunately the CD does not work with Extreme Audio, and it's out of stock. I have the idea what I should do now..."
5,awesome,didnt buy it on amazon.com but this sound card is awesome. i installed it in seconds and downloaded the disc and it works great. love the sound from my 5.1 surround sound speakers!i plan on buying more of these for the multi media computers i build!
2,Creative Lab SB0790 PCI Sound Card,"The sound Card driver was incompatible with Windows 7. When I try to install the driver to Windows 7, a message appears ""The audio device supported by this application may not be present or may be oprating in an unsupported mode, you need to close the application "" And the computer shutoff automaticallyI sent back the card to the Merchant .I had problem to get my credit back ."
2,Poor Sound,I used this card with a set of speakers that sounded great with a Creative card that no longer worked with windows 7. So I bought this and it sounds horrible. I've tried everything and have given up.
2,Problem connecting this card to amplifier via digital out,"I recently bought the Creative x-Fi Xtreme Audio PCI card. I also have a Samsung XQ-HT100 Home Theater system. Been trying to connect the optical out from sound card to the optical in of the HT. here's how I tried to:1) Used a 3.5mm mini-plug to square plug TOSLINK cable to connect from the digital i/o port of the soundcard to the optical in of the HT2) In Windows, I've set the default sound card to as SPDIF output and enabled digital output only.However, I cannot hear a single sound coming from my HT. Not even stereo.I've done exhaustive research on the net but came up with nothing. Problem still exist.Additional info:Using Windows Vista UltimateI noticed that in Creative Entertainment center there is an icon for digital I/O, however its missing for my version. Same thing for DTS/DD logo. Not sure if thats some clue for my problem.Giving it 2 stars for the (lack of) ease of usage."
5,X-Fi Xtreme Audio sound card it's GREAT for Music,Bought the Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme Audio sound card for music and to complement my new Boston MM226 speaker system. It made a Great Sounding speakers system sound even better. Strong software package. I'm impressed with the 24bit Crystalizer: Restore the details and vibrance your music and movies lost during compression. X-Fi technology intelligently enhances the highs and lows. I'm satisfied with this purchase and would recommend for anyone looking for a solid music card.
2,Good sound but connectivity to out side sources VERY LIMITED,"I do all sorts of sound configurations. I work as a sound tech for Concerts, Sporting Events, and Gaming Events. I also write my own music. I can't connect any of my midi instruments via direct connect or usb midi interface. I can't connect or sync my mp3 player, which is part of my phone. I do like Creative Media Source 5. I can organize what I need for Gaming Events for cribbage, bridge, pinochle, spades, and canasta tourneys. I can make half time music for basketball and hockey games. It burns cds very well. Riping songs off of cd's is very slow. Rhapsody, Windows Media Player, and I tunes are far faster. I loathe the microphone connection, everything sounds like -hit. The drivers belong on an audigy not on an XFI card. The chipset on the card is for an Audigy. Buyer beware the sound is great, but doing anything other than listening to tunes and playing games it isn't worth the money."
3,Bad copy of DVD,Watched the DVD and it is bad quality. There is something wrong with it. Doesn't play well. Wasted my money on this one. Enjoy the movie though. Too bad
1,about joshua's heart,HI I TRIED MANY TIMES TO CONTACT THEM. YOU HAVE NOT RESPONDED BACK TO ME. THE MOVIE JOSHUA'S CAME TO ME BROKEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. LET ME KNOW. PLEASE AUTUMN autumn33@att.net
3,Pan to small,I can't seem to find a recipe for the size of the pan. All pictures of the cake make the cake look larger than it actually is.
5,"Yes, that's EXACTLY what I meant.",""". . .people have been really kind. So far the reviews have all been excellent. But most folks seem to pick up on the comedy and the real stuff, the pieces of me too painful to give away in conversation, too hard to hold onto any longer slip through the cracks. If there's a message in this book it might be something like, ""If I survived, you can too."""
4,What a fun (slightly neurotic) story!,"I think this book portrays an aspect of Southern life one cannot find elsewhere in Southern literature. Jackie is a Southern homosexual chemically dependent aristrocrat with a host of equally eccentric relatives and friends. Believe it or not, these people do indeed exist in the South. I know many of them and I find them to be quite charming. I think you will like them, too. Be prepared for something slightly different than your standard Southern lit."
3,Canon 761 does not support Linksys Printservers,"Just purchased the Canon D761 printer/copier (feb 2004). This unit only supports two print servers... and I never heard of them. So it is not ""generic"" to most servers and should not be purchased if you need that feature. Reasonable printer and copy quality."
3,Think Twice Before Buying,"Three and a half years ago we purchased a D760 Image Class copier from Canon. We paid $642 for the machine and am currently on the third cartridge. Cartridges cost $150 per cartridge - that's a total of $1092.00. The machine has a counter in it and to date, has made 5495 copies - that averages about .18 cents per copy. Last week film began coming out of the machine where the paper comes out, and I was told the machine needs a new fusing unit assembly at $200. Since I live in a rural area, the machine, which is quite heavy, needs to be driven down to the repair shop, about 90 miles away, for $255 worth of repairs. The machine has been great up to this point, but I'm beginning to wonder if its worth repairing at all, or simply smarter to buy another brand of copier."
4,"John: Jesus - the Word, the Messiah, the Son of God","I bought this book to use as a spring board for a study that I am doing in SS and it has worked very well for what I wanted it for. I would recommend it as a study guide for the book of John as well, it is well done and well written with thought provoking questions."
4,The Book of John (MacArthur Bible Studies),"I have bought a number of John MacArthur's books because the research and information is excellent. This study guide is good, I think it could have been better if it had more commentary in the chapters. Overall, another excellent John MacArthur publication.Greg[...]"
5,John MacArthur fan,"As always, I was very pleased with the study of the Book of John written by John MacArthur. He is an amazing author and this online book was very reasonably priced. Very pleased!!"
5,Great small group study,"John MacArthur is my favorite group cirriculum author. This study brings in both an understanding of the passage as well as deep interpersonal questions to help the group explore their faith. Whether you are new to Christianity or have been a Christian for a long time, everyone will find something in this study to help grow their faith."
4,Good Book,I think that the Acorn People is a very interesting book. I think that the Acorn People made me think a lot. I used to laugh at handiccapped people but not any more. I feel bad for people like that. I feel like they don't have the chances we have. I now understand them well since I read the book. I felt like I was part of the story.
4,Yes You Can!,"This book was short and easy to read. But it has a powerful message. All people, even physically challenged ones, can accomplish great things. They can surprise many people, even those who work closely with them. This book inspires, even today, 20 years later. It helped change our attitudes."
3,The Acorn People,"The Acorn People was a good book; it showed how kids with disabilities can be like normal kids. One of the counselors, Ron, admits he only agreed to help at Camp Wiggins for the money-it seemed like it would be an easy job. But what he doesn't realize is that the disabled children can't do everything for themselves. During the next few days, Ron got to know the kids, and realized that in a way, they were just like him. Not only do the kids learn to have some fun, but also the counselors. Each learned something about him/herself."
4,"My Review of ""The Acorn People""",I think it's a terrific book. It helps us understand more about handicaped children
3,The Acorn people,I liked this book because people should really read about handicapped people. Maybe one day they will get handicapped or may have a handicapped person in their family. It might help them to know about them and some of the things that a handicapped person can really do. What I'm trying to say is that do NOT judge people by how they look or how different they are from you.
2,the Acorn People,I did not like the book because it was not my kind of book. I would rather read a book on bikes. I am not the type of person that likes this book. I would recommded this book to other kids that like to read about disabled kids. The kids in this book are different and the same as to regular kids.
1,misguided and demeaning view of disabled kids,"The hero counselor for a camp for kids with disabilities overcomes his aversions to an unpleasant cast of kids and gives them a happy summer in their otherwise miserable lives. In the end the author inexplicably has most of the kids die not long after the camp, even though none of the conditions is obviously life threatening.This book is maudlin and demeaning in the extreme and seems to be written from prejudicial fantasies rather than any knowledge or research about kids with disabilities. It has the unfortunate tendency to show up in ""recommended"" lists about disabled kids."
3,An alright book,"I think The Acorn People was a good book. It showed a group of kids who put aside their differences and try to normal kids. This book shows you that just because your handicapped, it doesn't mean you are any different than any other kids."
2,"Readers Beware, you may be bored to tears","Hello. I'm 12 years old and I was required to read the Acorn People for a school project. It did very little to hold my interest. I appreciated that it was a very down to earth book. In it you will go through two weeks of summer camp with several disabled campers, who form what they call the Acorn People. If you want to find out more, buy the book, but beware, it may bore you to death."
5,used to fix pressure washer,this item is very easy to use and was priced from Amazon way under the competition. I used it to fix stripped out threads on a pressure washer pump which otherwise would have had to be scrapped. Saved me $300 for a replacement pump. All you need to supply is the correct drill bit. An excellent purchase with outstanding results.
3,Widescreen or not?,"The movies ARE all in widescreen on dvd, BUT not all in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen, optimized for widescreen tv's. The movies ""Bikini Beach"" and ""How To Stuff A Wild Bikini"" are only 4:3 letterboxed widescreen, also not so good for a widescreen tv, unfortunately... But this is correct described on the case. The other movies are in good and crisp quality on dvd - better as the tv versions.I missed the movie ""Pajama Party"". Why is this movie not in this collection?Finally a fine collection, but the missed movie and the inconsequence with the 16:9 anamorphic widescreen optimizing brings one star to remove."
3,Sand&Surf,"A movie that reminds me of the days when I was young, wild at heart, and living in Southern California. I fell in love with Annette when in grade school, so she is the highlight of the series for me. Otherwise the plots are very weak, the action typical of the time, and most of the actors best for young children and teenagers to watch. A 'G' rated movie series at its best....enjoyable for awhile if you have nothing better to watch.What more can this senior citizen offer in review?"
4,Nostalgia beyond nirvana....,"Sherman, start the wayback machine...the night I got this I watched the first three (Beach Party, Muscle Beach Party, and Bikini Beach) one after the other...what a trip...yes, they're dated, but at their best surprisingly sexy. Some of the music is pretty lame, but a lot of it is terrific...Frankie (especially) and Annette have their spots to shine, as well as appearances by Dick Dale & the Deltones, the underrated Pyramids, the Hondells, Stevie Wonder (when he was still Little), Lesley Gore, a great James Brown and the Famous Flames performance, and Donna Loren at her absolute best. Beautiful widescreen prints as well. Not for everyone, but for those that remember the days...or want to...definitely recommended"
2,TV screen size,"I was very disappointed to find the these are not the from the theater release verions, but the modified for TV versions."
4,For My Husband,"my husband and I loves these movies and it was my husband' birthday, and this was one of the movies he wanted for himself"
4,"I love bikini""s!","I Love these movies! They are silly, filled with young pretty girls in bikini's, a weak story line and God I'm old! They make me smile and full of clean fun."
4,The 60's,I was a little girl when I would watch Annette & Frankie on television. I grew up loving these beach movies! They are fun to watch over & over again!
5,Movie,"Frankie & Annette MGM Movie Legends Collection (Beach Blanket Bingo / How to Stuff a Wild Bikini / Beach Party / Bikini Beach / Fireball 500 / Thunder Alley / Muscle Beach Party / Ski Party)I was so happy to find this, my daughter asked for this for Christmas and was so excited to recieve it. Great quality. thank you"
4,Love the beach movies!,"I love all of the beach movies! They are basically dumb entertainment but really fun, dumb entertainment! I also enjoyed the Ski Party movie. I really didn't enjoy Fireball 500 and Thunder Alley. They took the innocence away from Frankie and Annette and made them hardened sinning characters. I prefer more of an innocent act like with the beach movies. Pretty good pack of movies but no special features. I would be just fine if the pack left out the two car movies."
3,frankie & annette,"This was a birthday gift for my 27 year old daughter. I haven't watched it yet, so I can't really review it. She seemed excited about getting it, as she loves these old movies, but was disappointed to note that this grouping did not include her all-time favorite of the group, ""Back to the Beach."""
1,the frankie and annette collection,i was very upset this is all dubbed in spanish or french subtitles that you cannot turn off.
3,It's okay.,I didn't enjoy these as much as I thought I would. I thought it was kind of suggestive. I liked the Gidget and Tammy series more.
1,Disappointing at best,"I ordered the collection for my husband, who has always loved the ""beach"" movies, even though they're corny, make no sense and the acting is horrible. Even knowing beforehand that 3 of the videos included weren't beach movies, we expected they'd at least be equally as bad as the others. Not so. How To Stuff a Wild Bikini may be THE worst movie ever (with the exception of Videodrome), with musical numbers by Erik Von Zipper. Incidentally, he plays a race car guy in one of the other movies (unacceptable) which we turned off about a quarter through. We have no intention of watching the rest of the collection."
1,Somethings missing ???,"My purchase arrived promptly and in the condition expected. That was truly appreciated. The problem is that even though the lens is suppose to work for my specific camera, my camera does not fire with it attached.I've learned since that this is not an uncommon problem with the lens baby and I feel the seller should have warned of a possible problem and offered a solution in case I experience it. I wouldn't have made the purchase if I had known."
1,Pig in a poke,How can you buy anything without knowing what is inside? We need track listings otherwise don't list at all.
4,Oldie but Goodie,"Although now aged, this game is as addictive as any you might want. I played all the expansion packs, and was very sorry when it ended. I then played GRAW, which has much better graphics, but not the solid satisfaction of its predecessors. You can't go wrong with this one."
3,"good basic statistics, ""friendly"" format","This is the recommended text for my biostats refresher course, so obviously the lecturers think it's good. Good basic stats book, good examples relevant to vet and animal science research. Lots of exercises to test your knowledge of the chapters.Has all the tables and formulas required, good glossary of terms. I found it fairly easy to read."
4,By the Great Horn Spoon,By the Great Horn Spoon is a great book for children. It gives them a look at how it was during the gold rush years. I like how the author adds real historical information. This allows the children to learn while enjoying a good book.
4,by the great horn spoon! this rocks,"By the great horn spoon! is a wonderful book that is part drama and part tradegy, all glazed over with moderate humor.It is thae story of an orphan taken in by a seemingly rich aunt. When the aunt runs into financial trouble, he goes with her butler to the Californian goldfields with her butler via San Fransisco. A third of the book is about the sea bound journey to the goldfields and the rest is about the actual prospecting, creating two mini plots. However, the author glues the two together with numerous conversations about prospecting in the first plot. The end of the book is suprising and dissapointing, stolen from the wizard of oz.The characters are well developed, the two plots explode with energy, and this book is sure to make you smile."
2,why by the great horn spoon is great but bad,"By the Great Horn Spoon! is an OK book. If you have read The 13th Floor and hated the way it ended then you will also hate this book. The book ends suddenly with an ending which is not exciting. I suggest reading BanditsMoon. It is also about the gold rush,but it has a great ending. Sid Fleichman, the author, has a great way with words."
4,Adventures of Jack and Praiseworthy in 1849,"Have you ever read a book that will keep you reading for hours? Well if you have, I bet you read this book. This is such and exciting book, you will want to read it over and over.By the Great Horn Spoon by Sid Fleishman is a book about the adventures of Praiseworthy, the butler, and Jack who are searching for gold to save their Aunt Arabela's fortune. In the beginning Jack and Praiseworthy are stowaways on Captain Swain's ship, the Lady Wilma. They set sail for California and end up in a race with the Sea Raven. They meet up with lots of interesting characters. One of which is Cut-Eye Higgins who is a theif. Once they arrive in San Francisco their adventures continue.If you like adventure books you will love this one. I highly recommend it to anyone."
4,By the Great Horn Spoon by Sid Fleischman,I would recommend By the Great Horn Spoon to somebody who likes history and who likes a happy ending. I think people under 8 should not read it because it has words that are difficult to understand. I read this book in my fourth grade class and I thought it was a little boring.
5,Enjoyable and a useful teaching tool,"I am a 4th/5th grade teacher. I used this book as a core novel in class and it worked extremely well.Both my students and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The hilarious antics of Jack and Praiseworthy taught my students a great deal about the gold rush and about US and world geography while they were being entertained by the story. I was able to use the book as the basis for a host of writing and other activities.The richness of the language, especially the similies, made the book a great model for teaching writing.The book held the interest both of boys and girls alike. If you are a child looking for a good book to read, check out this one. If you are a parent or teacher looking for a book that is both high in quality and interesting to children, you will be glad to selected this book."
3,Some adventures for a master and a butler! Z.S.,"The new book my group got to read was ""By the Great Horn Spoon."" When I looked at the book cover and read the back of the book it didn't seem so interesting, and I was sort of right. The first few chapters weren't so good. Then it started to get better. The book is about a man named Jack and a butler named Praisworthy. They both get on a ship called the Lady Wilma, and from Boston they sail to San Fransisco and along the way they meet alot of different kind of people and have a great adventure. Now I really can't say any more or i'll spoil the book. I suggest this book because it's exciting, funny, mabye frightening, and filled with action in some parts of the book. So buy the book and you'll have a great time reading it."
2,Surprisingly Disappointing,"This book didn't hold my interest, the plot, the characters, or anything about it. This surprised me since I usually like this author, but I believe it was first published in 1963. Maybe that's why it wasn't very good."
1,Que tecateria!!!!!!!!,Opino honestamente que este cd es la porqueria mas grande que he oido en mi vida. Los Cd's que tiene mi hermano de Cepillin estan mejores que este tributo.
1,Basura,"Existe una movida llamada Punk Covers, que son tributos a bandas de los ochentas hechos por bandas Punk de los 90 y del 2k. De esta movida se pueden rescatar cosas muy buenas y cosas extremadamente malas. Este tributo a Soda, que sigue esa onda, lastimosamente fue hecho por bandas de principiantes y con una vision vocal e instrumental muy mala. El track ""en camino"" que forma parte, a mi criterio, del mejor album de Soda en cuanto a letras y musicalmente, como es el Signos, es realmente un insulto a la banda más grande de Rock Latino de todos los tiempos. Alejense de este disco, no es confiable ni por motivos coleccionisticos, realmente malo."
5,Buen album,"Jeeeee, casualmente el mismo Gustavo Cerati dice que es el mejor disco que se sacado de Soda."
1,Desastroso,"Hace tiempo leí los reviews de otros usuarios, hasta que me animé a oir los samples. Realmente solo a un retrasado mental podría gustarle este disco. realmente insulta la música de soda"
2,Francamente.....,"Con el debido respeto de los artistas que hicieron estos covers para ""Su Majestad"" Soda Stereo, considero que lo unico rescatable es Signos. Todo lo demas suena muy opaco y falto de un matiz musical y mas armonia en los acordes."
5,Un tributo bien merecido,"Después de la larga trayectoria musical de Soda Stereo, algo así se necesitaba, a mi, la música de Soda Stereo me parece excelente y este disco es una versión buenísima de lo que hizo Soda. TODO UN TRIBUTO BIZARRO"
4,UK PUNK AT IT'S BEST,"This recording is of CJ's earlier material, faster and not as dark as their later stuff. Lots of raw fun on here! But if you're looking for the ""gothier"" Creaming Jesus than you won't find it on this album. Rumor is that the band broke up, that's a big loss if they have...makes their albums that much harder to obtain in the U.S."
1,Confusing description and Unneeded tool,"You can't use this item to remove the pulley. It's used to put it back on.The description and packaging don't make this clear. WTF.Also, you can make the same tool and accomplish the same objective with a nut, washer and bolt.To make a long story short, I feel like I was defrauded out of $25."
4,remembering Blue Barron&His Orchestra,I rembeber the Blue Barron Orchestra. Foresome reason I remember his music being braodcast on Sunday afternoon at 2:00 PM (west coast time)in the early WW 2 days. Why did he come on at that time?..or am I mistaken after 67 years. He had a good dance band in the style of Guy Lumbardo or Russ Morgan. Smooth and easy to listen to. This CD brought back some great memories. Nice songs and lyrics.
4,good disc,"as a writer,arranger,Producer&vocalist i have always respected Gino Vannelli.Living inside myself& I just wanna Stop were my jams back in the day.he has a richness on these cuts.this is a good disc."
5,Amazing Gino!!!,"Prior to ordering this CD I had only been familiar with Gino Vanelli's most well known hit records which I had heard in the 70's and 80's as a child. But even as a child, I always admired the incredible range and sheer beauty of his voice. 30 years later, his voice and the production of his music still amazes. Even his lesser known singles on this CD are fantastic!! They simply don't produce records, write or sing songs of this magnitude anymore. This collection is truly a testament to Gino's incredible God given talent to bring joy to others with song. If you are truly a music lover and enjoy poetic,insightful lyrics, phenomonal vocals, masterful arrangements and top quality sound and production I strongly recommend purchasing this CD. You will not be disappointed."
3,Not so ultimate collection!,"The title of this collection is deceiving. To be an ultimate collection of Gino Vannelli's great music this CD should include songs from ""Inconsolable Man"". Where is ""Sunset on LA"" and ""If I Should Lose This Love.""? To not include songs from what I believe is Gino's best album ""Inconsolable Man"" is unforgivable.I will wait until a real ultimate collection comes out to buy it."
5,CLASSIC GINO,"This selective collection of memory-filled songs showcases Gino's genius and artistry over the last 27 years. He is a rare talent; his wellspring runs deep; he continues to teach and inspire us. We devoted fans know what a ""force"" he is, and he is in no way unappreciated by those of us with vision. We are kindred spirits. I am looking forward to what Gino is going to share with us in the future, but for now I will just replay my new CD. Ah-h-h, sing for me, Gino..."
2,Not the best quality,"I received my purchase maybe 10 days after purchase. The quality of the product is very cheap and not what I expected. The size is quite large as well, than a normal med/lg article of clothing. I must say I am quite disappointed for the amount that I purchased the item. I would return the item, but do you know how much it cost to send something to China!? That would be crazy? It would cost just as much to mail as it was to purchase. At the end, I would probably get back $10 of the $40 I spent. So, I am stuck with a piece of clothing I will probably never wear! Unfortunate indeed. I will not purchase from this company again."
4,Already one of the years' best!,"""A Long Story"" marks the ECM debut of the Israeli-born New York-educatedpianist Anat Fort. And what a great debut it is. Although it is only April it seems destined to be one of the year's 10 best jazz albums.Fort's compositions run the gamut from wistful to whimsical. She can be introspective and contemplative without becoming dreary or cumbersome. The cohesiveness of this project is further enhanced by the rhythm section that not only provides the essential foundation but also the framework for many of the compositions. But what else would you expect from living legend Paul Motian?While this album was not recorded at the ECM studios, it nonetheless has that characteristic ECM sound. Open. Spacious. Subdued. The only question is why this took 3 years to be released since it was recorded in early 2003. But, in the end, who cares? A great album all the way around. One can only hope that Fort's future efforts will build upon this impressive beginning."
3,Some of it is wonderful,"The main theme, which is on three tracks with variations, is very lovely. The other cuts are a mixed bag."
2,Recorded with a Cactus Needle,"I disagree with the previous reviewer. The sound quality isterrible. Too bad because the band is great and the singer fine.I was there at the Aragon listening to these songs in 1945,so I can really appreciate the music - if only it soundedreasonably well."
3,Insufficient commentary,"This book violates one of my primary pet peeves: It claims to be a commentary yet gives little to no help with grammar and syntax. I am sure there are many valuable insights to be had here, but in a text largely aimed at students, there should be much more help offered for translating the text. Only then will the student be able to appreciate any additional insight offered."
4,use with caution,"I used this book for class, but as is typical with the text of the Metamorphoses, there were definitely discrepancies throughout the text. I would recommend that you use more than just this text, perhaps the Oxford, in order to compare some areas where creative license was taken. Be sure to skim the notes on translation at the bottom if you're serious about the text. If everyone in your class is using this, not too big a deal since no one will have differences come up in the translation."
4,Ovid was NOT a Christian,"Just because someone lived in at the same time as Jesus does not make him a Christian--far from it, in fact. Ovid, as you might have noticed if you have read his works, is a poet who write about life, love, power, society, loss, loneliness, and the pain of exile."
5,Livefields is Incredible!,"This CD has it all. Incredible musicianship, great writing, and an awesome live feel. Musicians of this quality seem to be disappearing, and it is good to know that there are still some live players that out there that are this good. A must have."
3,So how is the video?,"When I was growing up, soccer was a word, but nobody played it.You played football, baseball, or basketball.Now I am the father of a seven year old, and I know nothing about the sport, and they don't teach it here in Florida. You just go out and kick the ball.Is this video good for children that age? Or is this video geared at people that just want to coach?If you want to sell this product, the description needs to be better."
4,Standells - 'Dirty Water/Why Pick On Me' (Big Beat) 4 1/2 stars,"Obviously, the band's 1966 landmark 'Dirty Water' lp, with their 'Why Pick On Me' album tagged on, this must-have 2-lp's-on one disc release. Great move, Big Beat! Just a couple of noteworthy cuts are their sole hit, of course ""Dirty Water"", the Stone's ""Paint It Black"", ""Sometimes Good Guys Don't Wear White"" and another Ed Cobb-penned gem ""Have You Ever Spent The Night In Jail"". Total of 19 tracks. Do keep in mind that on the Sundazed label reissue of both these lp's - you get a handful of pretty decent bonus cuts. Oh, for those who have inquired - 'Dirty Water' is in mono and the 'Why Pick On Me' album is in full stereo on this essential CD reissue. Enjoy."
5,big hit with young teen girls,"bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas and she loved it. tends to prefer the high tech toys (e.g. ipod, DVDs) but this was good old-fashioned fun. Plus it was interactive."
4,Pre-teen,A friend of mine with a preteen had this book done in a very short period. She really enjoyed it.
5,Awesome!!!,"I gave this to my 11 year old niece for Christmas and she absolutely loved it!! She went around asking everyone in the family the quizzes. It's colorful, bright and interesting art designs really grabs their attention. I would definitely buy this again for girls aged 10-13."
1,did not work at all,Will not start up at all on any of my 5 home computers or any of the 34 lab computers that I run. Not the first time I have had problems with this manufacturer.
5,Alphabet Express Preschool is great,"Aside from my son being scared of clowns, this is a great creation!"
5,Love this game,"We got this for my 3 year old's birthday present and he loves it. It was unbelieveable how fast he mastered the mouse. He is able to play on his own but it is fun to play with him too. He has learned a lot from this game. We also stocked up on cheaper games, but they are worthless - this is definitely worth the $20."
5,My lil guy likes it!,Great program. Comes with a parents section to keep track of use and progress. Grade sheet if you will. I like any game that keeps the kids learning something instead of smashing and hacking killing games.
2,Boring Psychology book,Purchased this for a persuasive technologies class. Material is very dry and boring. I think authors forget they are trying to capture an audience.
2,Cramps - 'Ultra Twist' CD single,"I agree with the other review for this CD single about this(actually,turns out there's three songs here)being striclty for Cramps completists.Track listing:""Ultra Twist""(3:49),""Confessions Of A Psycho""(3:00)and ""No Club Lone Wolf""(2:28).I'm guessing these come from the '94 'Flamejob' CD.I'll ALWAYS much prefer to purchase a full length CD.I'm sure I ain't alone on that."
4,It's worth a listen. And worth the money.,"I have come upon the realization that I find great pleasure in typing these reviews.With that in mind, I have found that thought this cd is old (it has, since it's release, been sold out, leaving nothing left but private sellers) it has an advanced feel, and a set of songs that make a real impact. Perhaps nothing more than the usual sounds of the genre, the crisp and clear synths and drums on the album make for an excellent accompaniment for the mundane highway drive. I would write more... but I have doubts as to who would actually read it...I bought this cd, and I like this cd. Does that mean nothing to you?"
4,"It sounds like LARS, NOT like RANCID","If you love the ska-punk sound of RANCID and are not into heavier styles of punk, then this albumn is likely not for you.A lot of other people compare this band to RANCID, but the only thing RANCID about it is Lars F's voice. However, if you still want to listen to some good old fashioned no-frills punk rock sung by one of punk's most beloved artists, then you will definitely not be disappointed with this albumn."
4,Far from cliche,"I don't know how someone could call Lars cliche... if anything he is the complete opposite, as is anything he is involved with. The lyrics on this album are very real and at the same time fun.. and even catchy at times. I mean, just listen to a song like Dead American, Skunx, or Vietnam and tell me that is cliche. This is not pop punk made up to sell CDs, most of the lyrics are very real and tell the story of his life. I saw this band twice on Warped Tour last summer and hadn't really heard much by them and was blown away. Because I like Rancid I had downloaded a couple of their songs beforehand.. but they really hit me most live and I had to get the CD. Personally my favorite songs on this album are Skunx, Campbell CA and Anti Social. To Have and to Have Not is alright too, is a cover song and it was a single I think. I def. recommend this CD, it is one you can put on and listen to the whole thing and like every song."
5,Lars is cool and stuff,These guys are really good.Lars has a voice that is extremely hypnotizing.I like this band a little better than rancid.Definatly pick this one up.The best tracks.......To have and have notdead americanarmy of zombiewine and roses.
2,Selfish Lars appeals only to Lars,"I don't know much about Lars Frederiksen, but he obviously doesn't think much of his band. He knows them a lot better than I do so he may be right, but I'm prepared to give them a chance. This is more of a compilation of other artists than a Lars Frediriksen album. Lars takes his vocal stylings from one popular punk rock band, while his drummer copies another, his guitarists steal from another, etc. I don't know which bands are borrowed from because they all sound the same to me. The man on the cover of this album has a mohawk hair cut which shows he is a big fan of the A-Team and Mr. T. I bought this album expecting to hear something Mr. T would be proud of and maybe some songs about Mr. T, but instead Lars chooses to whine selfishly about his own life. He breaks from this however to sing ""Army of Zombies"", a song about the SNES game ""Zombies Ate My Neighbours"". Overall this a decent Rancid album."
5,LARS,"Lars Fredericksen is still one of the Kings of Punk Rock. I recommend this for any Rancid fans out their and if you don't like this then you shouldn't be listening to PUNK. My personal favorite is ""To Have And To Have Not."" Thats all in my review lata"
5,Of special interest and value for the novice student,"For the non-specialist general reader, the history of the land of Robert Burns, Scotch whisky, and Queen Mary has never been so well done as with the Oyster Press edition of The Illustrated History Of Scotland by Chris Tabraham (Principal Inspector of Ancient Monuments for Historic Scotland). The informed and informative text is superbly illustrated throughout with the professional photography of Colin Baxter. Of special interest and value for the novice student of Scottish history is extensive ""Chronology"" appendix that begins in 2,800,000,000 BC with the stones of Scotland's original formation near the South Pole, and then proceeds upward to the Second Elections to the Scottish Parliament of 2003 AD. No personal, professional, academic, or community library World History collection can be considered complete without the inclusion of Chris Tabraham's The Illustrated History Of Scotland!"
2,WARNING,"I bought this cd and even though it is somewhat good to people who would be fans of easy listening like my mom, it is NOT CRADLE OF THORNS! IT IS A DIFFERENT BAND!"
2,Outdated and Jaded,"This book is a nice overview of various options available to those having difficulty conceiving. Unfortunately, this field changes quickly, and since it's publication it's very outdated. Techniques she discusses are now rarely used because newer/more effective treatments have been established. Also, her slant against fertility treatments (as she admits in the preface)is obvious throughout the book. Finally, the author's understanding of research appears limited. Specifically, she fails to consider that IVF pregnancies are not at higher risk of miscarriage - maternal age is the risk factor. It just so happens that those who receive IVF treatments are generally older."
5,the nicholas cage celebrity pack,I have alays been a fan of Nic's. I have all of his movies on DVD. That one purchase was three of the best!! Was like brand new.
5,Desert island album!,"This is the most unbelievable latin jazz album of all times, definitely near the top of my 'desert island list' if not right at the top. Unstoppable drums section, perfect synchronisation of the brass instruments, passion and soul firing up in every direction, truly mesmerizing. If you feel down, then listen to this and you will be back on track in no time. A special note about the greatest congero of all times Anga, who sadly left us far too young, but his spirit will carry on. By the way if anybody has any kind of news from this band please post it here, I have been waiting in despair for more than a decade now for the successor to Maferefun, and I am in agony!... :-)"
5,Great company for lonely nights,"Townes Van Zandt's performance on this album made me appreciate his earlier recordings all the more, but he was still my favorite of the three. Hearing him do ""Pancho and Lefty"" in that rusty old voice made me weep, and his monologue about having a gold tooth extracted as a gambling debt made me laugh till I wept. It means even more now, knowing that this was very likely one of his last public appearances.Anyone expecting perfection here will be disappointed. But it's the roughness of this performance that makes it so damned endearing."
5,Great Friends,This is a fantastic collaboration of three great American singer song writers who also happen to be great friends. I just wish I had been at the Bluebird Cafe' when it was recorded.
4,An unvarnished recording of three legends,"I wasn't as bowled over by this as I expected to be--the selections are not my favorites, and of course it is not a studio recording. But it is a chance to hear three legends enjoying each other and what they are doing. So I'm glad I have heard it, and will be able to hear it again."
1,Stick to Songwriting,"Guy Clark's vocals are fine, but Earle and Van Zandt should stick to songwriting. They are awful. Maybe it's just the poor production quality of the live performance, but I'm a fan of this type of music and I couldn't even listen to the CD all the way through. Go buy Robert Earl Keen or Pat Green instead. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,presents,"I bought this as a present and haven't actually heard it, so the three star rating is more for 'I don't know, than a simple, it's okay."
3,Van Zandt over-loaded,"I enjoyed Earle and Clark, but Townes Van Zandt seemed barely conscious by the end of the album. Maybe this is quaint or realistic for some, but for me it was just kinda pathetic."
2,I guess you had to be there,"I would have loved to have seen this, but since you're just listening, you might as well stick to the studio albums and hear good versions of the songs."
1,Amazon won't refund my money,"I mistakenly ordered this album when I was trying to order another. Amazon refuses to return my money. I'm suspicious about this whole thing. When I try to play the songs on the album I did want, I cannot. The message is something about 30 days since I downloaded the music. Way to complicate using your service."
1,Not to be confused with an artistic performance,These are easily among the weakest performances by established artists I have ever heard. All those responsible for this release should be ashamed. These are talented singer/songwriters. Seek out other recordings.
1,BY-BY Amazon,"Once again a package that won't fit my mailbox . tried e-mail customer service got sonjay in india no clue what the problem or the language was , so i called customer service got someone in manilla offered me some promotion . I told her i was done order returned . I can not believe in this economy that this company sends it's customer service overseas to people that don't even have a working knowledge of OUR language . I for one am done with amazon i am choosing to send my money to an american company like lonestar.com ,by-by amazon check my account to see what you lost"
2,Comb,"I purchased this product at a pet store and wasn't impressed. It takes longer to route out the fleas from the fur. The newer design impressed me enough to buy it, but after using it, I am going to throw it into the back of a drawer and go back to the old reliable traditional flea comb."
1,It is unbelievable Indiana Press let this translation become a book,It is unbelievable Indiana Press let this translation become a book.
2,Far from his best work...,"Fugitive Nights is pretty disappointing compared to some great novels like: The Delta Star, The Choirboys, and The Blue Knight. His last trip to the desert in The Secrets of Harry Bright was, as was much of his early work, a story cops could relate to and enjoy reading. Much of his newer work (Fugitive Nights, The Golden Orange, Finnegan's Week, etc)involve characters who are burn-outs or alcoholics. Stories like these are somewhat cliched, and do not typify most police officers. While they do exist, these characters detract from the story instead of adding to it. Perhaps being out of police work for so many years has left Mr. Wambaugh without a sense of what it's like, or how interesting the working cops still are. It's too bad because his early work was very real AND entertaining."
2,Lipton Iced Tea 2 Go=2 Versions,"Hey this Iced tea 2 Go has 2 Versions one with Splenda and no Warnings on the package and one with Aspartame & a FDA Phenylaline warning on the Box.I like the version of the product without a FDA warning on the side.Be sure you get the right product on this one, I was fooled too.."
3,They are shoes,"At first feel, they were not very soft but some of the break in did help. They are not the type of shoes to show off, but they get the job done. The gel in the soles make the feel different. I don't think I really like the gel."
4,Best thing I ever spent my money on,"I tried the Braun 5270 before I tried this one and it was horrendous. But since I hate shaving I decided to give epilating one more try and bought the Norelco HP6492. And its awesome. The first time it stung a little but you get used to it very quickly, although some spots are always super sensitive (behind the knees). The skin cooler def. helped but the problem with it was it cooled down way to fast. Make sure you pull your skin taut it makes the whole process much easier. It took me 2-3 times of epilating until my legs were really perfectly hairless they way I wanted them. The hair def. grows back much lighter and finer. I'd also suggest regularly exfoliating to prevent ingrowns. Great great buy."
4,Does as advertized,"The Norelco Epilator does work as advertized, all though it does require multiple passes to remove all of the hair. Some of the shorter finer hair did have problems being removed."
4,I bought this for my wife,"This is a great product. You have to be very careful reading the instruction it clearly says that you have to be patient and wait until your hair takes used to the Epilator. That's the problem with my wife, she doesn't have any patience and she says is not working properly.I use a Norelco machine and know this technology actually works.Nice product."
3,"Great try, but it breaks too easily.","First off, epilating is a great option for hair removal if you can't afford to wax every time your hair grows back. It says ""legs only"" but I use this thing everywhere (i'm a guy btw!).It's a nice product, the massaging head is great. The ice pack thingy isn't so useful, but the massager really helps ease the pain.Here's my problem. I have owned two Philips epilators (this one, and the cheaper model) and both times the epilating head has broken in the course of normal use, and shortly after buying it. I'd chalk it up to bad luck if it was just one device, but seeing that it happened to both, I'm getting suspicious. (and no, i wasn't unduly rough with either of them).I'm going to try a different brand, and I'd suggest anyone considering a Philips model to, well, consider again. It would be a great device if it didn't break after a week!"
1,Not durable,"My daughters and I loved the product at first, but we've been using it for only 3 months and the epilator head has stoped working. Looking at the manual, it seems this part is not for sale and there isn't an authorized repair service within 75 miles. So, what an I supposed to do?"
3,"easy to use, but misses a lot of hair!!!","I bought this based on recommendations from CR magazine. It's very easy to use, but after 2 uses, I find that there are still LOTS of hairs left on my legs and around the knee area. It's very frustrating to see that after spending so much time using the product. I don't get that ""baby smooth"" feel like I do with a razor."
3,Good product so far,Product has been satisfactory so far. The length and width is somewhat awkward but one gets used to it. It's easier to clean than my earlier non ceramic epilator.
4,Good but not what I expected,"The Norelco epilator is not what I have expected.I had another Philips, satinelle ice, and it was doing a better job.It doesn't really pull of all short hairs."
3,Good but..,"I bought it in 2008 and used it quite often. Overall, it met my expectations.However, the epilator head died so ordering the correct one was a nightmare. Philips no longer makes them. No wonder why!"
2,Epilator jammed after working for 15 minutes,"It was being used for the first time. It lasted 15 minutes only. The epilator jammed. I could not see hair, so most probably it was manufacturing defect.The motor is good, epilator works fine. That is why I m giving 2 stars instead of 1. Customer service said it will take 20-25 days to send me the defective peice and get it repaired or replaced. They will send me an envelop after 10-12 working days :( silly.FYI they give 2 years warranty, that explains, because they take 2 months to replace one peice.Other part is don't buy from Amazon, because they give partial amount for opened items. Otherwise i could have gone to the shop and replaced it in no time.Bad experience overall :("
4,it's the most effective lady shaver ever !!!,it does clean your short and thin hairbut for the the area you just shave them first timeyou will feel a little bit hurtit shave your hair really cleanbut it's hard to use on folding skin
4,It should be painless...,"It should be painless, but still is the best on the market the ice really help make it less painful. Great Product!"
1,Ouch,This thing pulls the hair out and hurts really bad. I put it in a drawer after a couple of uses and then threw it away
2,OUCH OUCH and more OUCH,"This little thing should have this as the tagline on the box ""Beauty is pain"". I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and I was ready to start crying. I suffered through the session and did my legs up to the knee. I ended up with HORRIBLE ingrown hairs that took weeks to heal. I continued to use it on my forearms, because it worked well and didn't leave the ingrown hairs my legs did. I think my hair is too course for this device, so I stopped using it.All in all I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE unless you wish to spend PAINFUL hours using it and then weeks healing up from the mess it leaves.BOOO"
2,Breaks easily,"I purchased the item from a local Target Store. It does work, when it is functioning. I used it 4 times with good results but then it stopped working. Just clicks and the head doesn't spin. It is too expensive to have such a short life span."
4,Not too bad,I have used this for 2 years now and I do like it. I don't use the epilator as much as the shaver though. both work great and I had never used an epilator before so I bought this one because it had both. I love the Norelco brand anyway. I had previously used a lady remmington and I couldn't get the blades anymore so I was on the prowl for a new razor. I don't use the ice much because I don't use the epilator much. I think this is the best one on the market as far as that goes though. The razor is great too. Much better job than my remmington.
3,Not quite as smooth as shaving,"I've used epilators before, so I knew how painful they were. I bought this one thinking that the ice would numb the skin a bit. The ice pack sits on the back of the epilator and doesn't touch the skin. The only thing that got cold was my hand. Useless. I still use the epilator, but I use after-sun lotion with lidocaine before I use it. That helps a little, but not much. The head on this one is way too narrow. The Emjoi is still the leader of the pack."
4,very practical,This product fits fine in my shelf cabinet and makes it much easier for me to stack dishes. Reasonable price too!
3,Not Very Durable,"I used the Black Herculiner on a trailer bed, the white on the mounted toolboxes. I prepared the surfaces well, I am a professional painter, but the product failed to adhere satisfactorily. Looks nice but is not durable."
2,Not a Buy for 8 foot bed !!!,"The quart size in white is discontinued, supposedly due to slow sales. So now, if you have a 8 foot pick-up bed, you have to buy two gallons. I will buy another brand, even though this has good ratings for product."
2,not worth the work,I was looking for mini tart shell that I had purchased at a California winery and these were the closest I found. When I went to use them about one third were broken. The only way to fill them is by piping as the opening is very small as is the cavity. They were too much work for the finished product.
3,3.5 stars for trying,"I just recieved this to day,first off the cheep batteries that came with it exploided inside it and I had to clean it with electric motor cleaner (no problem)the light is not as bright as I expected(but gets the job done)and the magnet strength is average (again acceptable)do not expect to recieve a top quality product here although the handle is rather nice."
3,Not what was advertised,"This is the item that should have gone with the wrong review that a person reported earlier. But, what was supposed to be radio shows turned out to be audio only of his popular movies."
4,Great value,"I really like these binoculars. Wonderful value for the money. They look good, perform very well AND feel good to the touch. Only complaint is that a nicer strap could have been included."
4,You were always on my mind...,"The Doctor and Ace arrive in the English village of Cheldon Boniface... Or so it appears! Just past the village's outskirts is the surface of the moon.The conclusion of the Timewyrm quartet, this one is perhaps the most interesting of the four (others might argue that 'Timewyrm: Exodus' should hold that distinction). Inherent to this book is an examination of just how the change of personality that comes about with regeneration is played out in the Doctor's mind.This book turns many of Doctor Who's accepted tenets on their heads while still maintaining them, and may very well be a true revelation to readers who follow the series.Paul Cornell is often spoken of as one of the better writers on Virgin's New Adventures line. Pick this one up and see why."
4,Teachable Touchables,A little smaller than I expected but will work nonetheless. The small carrying bag is nice to have so they will all stay together.
3,Play Money,I was disappointed in the size of the bills. I felt that the picture advertising this product was misleading. Great item for young children.
5,A Great Teaching tool!,"I bought this play money to go along with a toy cash register for my Grandchildren, ages 6 and 8. The kids frequently have lemonade sales and I think the cash register will help them learn math and money counting. They practice with the play money and it has been a wonderful teaching tool."
4,Play money,"The money is a great tool to teach kids how to count, give change back.I am very pleased with the product"
4,Glad I purchased,Purchased to go along with a cash register for my 6 year old. Realistic and easy for her tohandle. She plays with often. Would recommend!
5,Play money,"My grandchildren love to play store and I wanted to get them some play money that looked more realistic than the fake looking set that they had. This set was great and very ""real"" looking. I was happy with the quality and the price, as well. The children loved it, and continue to play store for hours with their new money."
1,Not what I paid for.,I expected larger bill. Because that's how it looks in picture. And I don't think you should charge $10.76 for what I received in the mail. Very disappointed.Play Money: Coins and Bills TrayWould have like to have known more about product before I paid for it.
3,play money,"The bills are much smaller than real bills and all of the coins are stamped with ""COPY."" I was disappointed b/c all of the reviews I read were good."
5,This book explained every aspect of psychology to me.,"Excellent book, it put every aspect of psychology in common words and terms that I could understand and brought me to a higher level of understanding."
4,A good book of Psychology,I can learn the basic of the psychology from this book since this is the textbook of my college!
4,We all learn...,"Thank you Richard for courageously updating your ""Small Stuff"" book with this book. After reading it I gave it to a friend going through Chemo Therapy.There is big stuff in our lives and this book helps us see a light at the end of a seemingly endless tunnel."
1,This Can Be A Dangerous Toy!,"I bought this toy for my son (the boy's version) for his 2nd birthday. It was fun for a few days...until he went head over heels on a very small slope in our yard. The toy landed on top of him, with his neck rolled and pinned under the toy. He was so terrified of it after that, he refused to get back on. It has been stored in our basement and will be sold at the next yard sale. Save your money - this toy is too tipsey for toddlers and way too fast for them to control the steering!"
2,Tips over easily,"While my two daughters have a had their share of fun on this toy, I would highly recommend that you get a four-wheeled ride on toy. This one has tipped over on us a few times and left them in tears. If I had it to do all over again, I would definitely avoid the three-wheeler and stick with something that has more stability. If you choose to go ahead with the 3 wheeler, definitly get a helmet for your kids to wear while riding."
1,"Small step, not giant leap","What a shame. This is one of the most amazing subjects in -- and out of -- this world, but this book is bland and sometimes wrong. What a waste. It's another tale of the X-15 and moon program, thinly told through Armstrong's resume. Yes there is some neat and new stuff here, but not much. It is all overshadowed by the errors and omisions. Yes, that is Buzz on the cover. The quote as Armstrong walked on the moon is wrong. Neil was not an 'ace' in Korea. In describing an Earth orbit docking, Wagener talks of 'twinkling' navigation lights -- but I thought the twinkling we see is an atmospheric effect. What did it really look like in orbit? I don't trust this book to tell me.There are many great books on Armstrong's times and events, I'd buy many of them before this one. And wait for someone like Jeffrey Kluger, Neil Thomson or Andrew Chaikin to get us close to Armstrong. UPDATE: The book you're looking for has been written, it'sFirst Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong"
1,One Inaccuracy after Another,"The book cover tells us that Wagener was a journalist for 30 years. This book makes me wonder what kind of journalist he was. The book is full of inaccuracies. Some examples: he calls cosmonaut Alexi Leonov Alexi Leonor; he states that Christa McAuliffe was selected as the Teacher in Space because she won a ""Why I Want to Go Into Space"" essay. (cheapening her hard work and ultimate sacrifice); he writes the shuttle's solid rocket boosters fall into the ocean and are never used again even though they are recovered, refurbished, and reused. There is no documentation for statements he makes that contradict other records. This is poorly written and researched book. I have told my wife, who is the director of our local library, not to waste money buying the book. I won't donate my copy to the library. Ignore the book and read the books written by those who were a part of the effort of going to the moon."
1,Great Subject . . . Poor Book,"I must admit I was skeptical about this book upon seeing Buzz Aldrin on the cover instead of the books subject Neil Armstrong. I tried to give the author the benefit but upon reading the book it was just filled with too many factual errors to be considered an accurate account of Armstrong. Admittedly I am an aircraft and space enthusiast and someone who didn't know about the subject would not catch the most of the errors in this book, however, the erroneous information discounts the validity of the book in my opinion. It's a shame because what an intriguing character Neil Armstrong is!"
1,Not Worth The Money or the Time,"Even if you ignore the dozens of technical errors, the fact that the author never interviewed the subject speaks volumes about the insights that aren't there. Hopefully some day Neil Armstrong will speak out and tell us about how he felt during various adventures of his life--the moon landing in particular. Having someone who has little knowledge of the aviation and space environment try to fake it just doesn't work.Now how can I get my money back on this lemon?"
4,"Good Book, Bad Cover","The marriage between author and publisher can be a chancy thing. Here we have a good biography of Neil Armstrong, first man to set foot on the moon. The book appears to be well-researched and credited.Unfortunately, the publisher did not do as much work as the author. This is immediately obvious by the photo of Buzz Aldrin on the cover. There is a tiny image of Neil Armstrong reflected in the faceplate, but the main image is Aldrin. Aldrin's name tag is clearly visible through the ""A"" in the word GIANT.But if you can ignore having the wrong man on the cover, the insides are worth reading. Neil's adventure is one of the great achievements of the last fifty years and has had far too little actually written about the men themselves.This is a wonderful addition to the library of any fan of the space race."
1,What an insult!,"If you want to know about Neil Armstrong - the real man, not the man conjured up in some author's mind - read ""First Man"" by James Hansen. Hansen actually sat down for 50+ hours of interviews with Armstrong himself.As they say - ""from the horse's mouth""."
3,Still waiting for the good stuff !,"If you're like me and most Apollo spaceflight fans, you're still wondering what Neil was thinking and feeling as he and his crewmates trained for, prepared and executed that most amazing feat - the first lunar landing.This book does provide some great insights into many aspects of Neil's life and career. Many times I expected and found myself getting ready for quote or comment from Armstrong himself. It never happens, which is the ultimate disappointment I have with this book. As others have said, there are some errors and omissions. But, if you're starving for some good background on things surrounding Armstrong's life, this book is good. There are no direct quotes or contributions from Neil himself. I still enjoyed the read, and I'm still waiting for Neil to tell it like it was."
3,Armstrong Deserves Better,"Although this book provides the basic facts of Neil Armstrong's life and career, it lacks substance. After reading 300-plus pages about one of the country's ablest test pilots and the first man on the moon, the reader comes away scarcely knowing anything about what motivated Armstrong or how he was viewed by his contemporaries. One of the century's most interesting characters remains a mystery.Additionally, this book could have used a good editor. Careless spelling mistakes diminish its effectiveness. The name of Alan Shepard, for example, is spelled incorrectly throughout the text and also in the index.Here's hoping that a better Armstrong biography finds its way into print soon."
1,not worth reading it,"save your money on this one and wait for ""First Man"" by James Hansen which might be comming by the end of the year. In contrast to Wagener, Hansen knows Armstrong personally and has a history of writing great books on technology and spaceflight.""One giant leap"" is really not worth the time one would need to read it and apart from the errors in there it doesn't capture his great personallity i was fortunate enough to get to know myself."
2,Skip this dismal excuse for an accurate bio,"I have to quote from another review here- from an Apollo program engineer:""I finally gave up listing the errors I found in this book"" I concur. This book is (to quote the hospital tech in the film ""The Right Stuff"", ""...b-a-d, BAD"". While I was exposed to Apollo program engineering as a youth, my era of engineering experience is after the fact, but being an American spaceflight historian and a believer in either being accurate (otherwise, why bother?) or at the least show the attempt(!) this one is just not good- full of supposition, and statistics that can be verified if one makes the attempt. Get ""First Man"" by James Hansen- it's the authorized bio of Neil A. and is cool (for me anyway) in that he even takes the reader back generations leading up to the creation of a truly heroic human."
5,"SHEP FIELDS,VOL2",I've always enjoyed Shep Fields orchestra. This CD is an excellent review of the music heard back in the early 40's.Vocalist Hal Derwin's liner notes tell the whole story of the Fields band.Some remarkably good accordion work by Caesar Muzzioli with this band. Worthwhile listening.
5,1940 Vol 2 (Shep Fields),If you are a Lawrence Welk fan you will enjoy this CD album too. This album gives us more of the rippling rhythm of yesteryear. Here are a number of song I never knew until nowShep Field recorded.
4,This movie is actually pretty good.,"Rookie of the Year is actually a pretty good movie and even though it might seem like one og those stupid Disney non-cartoon movies it is a pretty funny movie.This movie is about a boy (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who loves to play baseball but is horrible until he brakes his arm and is able to snap is arm forward so he can throw a baseball 100MPH and then get's an offer to play for his favorite team, the last place Cubs and he becomes a big help to the team.There is also love in this movie but it is mostly a kids and grown-up comedy.I'd say if you like baseball see Rookie of the Year or if you like comedys see Rookie of the year.I'm shoor you'll like this movie."
5,Very pleased,I was happy to find the item I was looking for. The item I ordered was packaged well and arrived very quickly.
2,no title,"Why the late, great, Gene Siskel gave this a good review is beyond me - not nearly as good as ""The Sandlot"". In fact, I thought it mostly lame throughout, especially on baseball facts. Gary Busey was fine, however. He was also in ""The Firm"" of the same year."
3,An enjoyable movie but sometimes shaky,"This movie was a little better than averege, but not by a lot. It was unrealistic and sort of weird at some parts, but all in all I liked it. I liked the humor, especially that strong Met Herrod. There was also a memorable quote when Thomas Ian Nicholas, a good actor in his day, hits the doctor in the nose and the doctor shouts, ""Fffffunky butlovin'!"" That is a great quote and really shapes the movie, so I will give it 3 stars."
4,"kids playing in the pros, whats next child porn stars",a boy has suffered a broken arm so he went to the doctor he wore a case every since the case came off his arm hasn't been the same he can throw like he belongs in the pros that became a big advantage for him that why major league baseball agreed to let him play then be became famous his step dad is trying to make money off of him every since he became his manager.
5,Son had to have,Came quick even before it was supposed to! Love it! Great Christmas item. Wll be ordering from here again. Thanks!
5,Thomas Ian Nicholas,"Thomas Ian Nicholas did a great job in this film, out of every child stars in movies in the ninties he made it. He came from Rookie of the Year to American Pie. When American Pie started he and Alyson Hannigan were recognizable but everyone else is unknown. Jason Biggs would have been fourteen if he saw the movie, Chris Klein would have been thirteen if he saw the movie, Eddie Kaye Thomas would have been twelve or thirteen if he saw the movie and Alyson Hannigan would have been eighteen if she saw the movie. Him, Elijah Wood and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are the guys who made it big."
1,Possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seeen.,"The acting. Whao. It was, well, bad. The characters strange mood swings, and the actors bad facial expressions (having fun, where am i). The stunts were unrealistic and poorly performed (when the mom jabs a punch at her ex-boyfriend and sends him flying backwards down the stairs? C'mon. Not even Ali could send a man doing back-flips like that) Also tricks the boy does to get on base are strange: teasing a proffessional baseball player by saying he is chicken and pyching him out so bad that he can't think straight? Most proffessional baseball players (you'd think) would be smart enough not to take dares from the pitcher.Save yourself the $9.98 and buy a real baseball movie."
1,Painful,"I read somewhere that director Daniel Stern loved baseball. It doesn't show. The baseball scenes are excruciating and embarrassing. I struggle to comprehend how anyone who loves baseball could enjoy this movie. I ended this movie angry, I recommend you steer well clear."
1,negative 10 stars,This movie had horrible acting all the way through it...If I had a copy of this dvd i would use it as a door stop not to watch it...it's a horrible movie and should be thrown out of movie history
3,could be better but a decent workout and intro to African dance,"I really like Debra Bono and I like this routine, it's just a bit perfunctory. This coming from somebody with a very long dance background who is now taking two courses, sometimes three, in African dance. One of her dancers keeps forgetting steps and getting lost, which is distracting. It is a demanding workout once you get the steps. A bit more cultural background would be great."
2,Instructions are lacking,"I love watching African dance and thought that this would be a great way to learn some of the moves and get a good workout at the same time.I'm sure this is a wonderful DVD for those who have done African dance before or who pick up dance steps REALLY quickly. My problem was that the insructor would demonstrate the step very briefly, launch into the move at full speed, and then go on to the next step without much opportunity for the student to practice. I need to do a new step 3-4 times before I'm ready to tackle the next one. The pace was lightening speed which is too bad because the moves are beautiful."
2,Not everything stated in previous reviews are correct.,"I was interested in what I might get from this book. I'm lost. It's not a one star book because the intentions are good. Otherwise, save your dough and buy one of the many other titles available.I was lost in the intention of the product. After realizing that the author is attempting to slam other writers, I easily see why. The author should spend more of his time on one thing he does well, not ten things he thinks he is somewhat okay at."
1,hensley is a talentless hack,hardluck has it right this guy either has a bunch of freinds juking his reveiws or he has carved a very specific niche in writing for auto salesmen who are also horror fans the same people who have doubled their sales also have read every horror book by this hack and gave them raving reveiws. you people should be ashamed of yourselves this man dose not belong in the same sentence as Stephen King. spend your money on real writers and not this hick. you maybe able to fool your hillbillie neighbors but not everyone. p.s. my xbox360 broke yesterday and yes i do have time to research and did and you guys are juking your stats anyone else interested it takes 2 seconds to see.
1,What a joke!,"This book is a total joke. It took me about 30 mins to read, is only like 59 pages, and almost half of his content are sample scripts and letters.The content is not insightful, full of typos and poor grammar, strangely changing fonts for no apparent reason, and is full of obvious Do's and Don'ts.It's obvious that this guy got his buddies to give good reviews to pump his pathetic book. Do not waste your money. If you saw this book in a book store and thumbed through it, you would never buy it. This is the downside of Amazon.Do not buy this book, and don't buy a car from this guy either, for that matter."
2,BBBBBBBOOOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNGGGGGG,This story is boring it would have been better if it would have had more action.
1,What a sophorific (meaning causing sleep) book!,"I wanted to read this book because it took place during the Holocaust, and normally, I find that time period intruiging. However, this book disappointed me. The characters are shallow and one sided, and the story is unoriginal & predictable. Also, the authors descriptions of, well- everything, were vague and contradictory. If you insist on reading this book, get it from a library, don't waste your money."
4,This Book is and intresting book and I enjoyed to read it.,"I read ""Waiting For Anya."" This book is a great book to read. This book is about the way the Jews were fighting in the Holocast. This book takes a little while to get into but by the end you are taken in by the book. It made me feel unhappy to think of what happened to the people in this book. It helps to understand how heartless some people can be and your family is the strongest bond yet. This is a great book to learn on the Holocast and to read for yourself."
4,GREAT!,"waiting for anya is very realistic. Set in war time. saving jewish children. a bit of humor in it too. if, your one of those who wanders what it's like to live in war. u should read this."
1,Waiting for Anya,I Don't want to leave a comment because I Don't want to the book is good and all I just don't want to leave a comment.
4,Worth the price..,"With the price being what it is for this game these days, I would say it is worth it. It is pretty scenic and ahead of its time. Great if you like to solve puzzles.I would say the best part about this game is the soundtrack, which is absolutely amazing."
3,"Fun, but not as great as Myst and Riven.","Loved the puzzles, some were quite challenging. Overall a great game. Not as visually amazing as Myst or Riven and didn't enjoy the ending."
1,Depressing,"I, for one, have always been respectful of an individual's opinion. I believe the advancement of society to establish a civil, competent, and accomplished world has a key, and it is mutual respect for another's intellectual viewpoint. However, it is quite depressing to see how easily a smear campaign begins between two respectable professions who should possess an altruistic, benevolent, and common goal: to ensure the treatment and maintain the health-being of the patient. It is sad how seemingly thoughtless and easy this can be sacrificed just to prove some pride-driven agenda to smear another profession who is just as educated and trained to serve the public. It is selfish how society is being attempted to be robbed of a possible, alternative cure"
1,Correction...,"I need to make a correction on an earlier submission. I inadvertently cited Kenneth Blum, Ph.D. as the biostatistician of the Miami School of Medicine who designed the study. I meant to list Robert Duncan, Ph.D., with all else remaining the same. Kenneth Blum, Ph.D. is from the Department of Biological Sciences, University of North Texas who discovered the A1 allele D2 receptor gene anomoly. My apologies to anyone affected by my error."
1,There are good and bad everywhere,"Although the book does have some valid points and some useful information, its approach and attitude was sophomoric. Bad points can be raised about any group - MDs, DCs, Priests, Teachers, Parents, etc. Does this mean that any group that has a bad apple is an entirely sour bunch? I think not. After reading this book it is apparent that the authors and editor have a personal or even vengeful agenda to discredit an entire profession. Their anger and biased nature oozes through each page."
1,This author does not have a clue!!,"Gee, thousands of people die each year because of medical doctors(drug interactions, failed surgery and so on)chiropractors rarely kill anybody(probably none), some injuries do occurr though. Your chances with a MD are much slimmer than with a chiropractor."
1,"I thought a doctor lived by the expression ""First do no harm","A very silly book, obvious propaganda, Manger certainly has an agenda. I'm very aware that medicine has a dismal record when it comes to back problems (I know..I'm an Internist). I've referred many to chiropractors and have received marvelous feedback. Pain which had been present for years had resolved in a relatively short time. This is after the patient (or insurance) spent countless thousands on PT, MRI's, Cat Scans etc. If this book keeps potential patients away from a very probable method to relieve symptoms, then Manger is ""Doing Harm"" Isn't the patients welfare the primary concern? Not with Manger, and his buddies..especially Barrett and Hamola. Lastly..a suggestion to these ""quackwatch"" people: Learn to write intellegently, the public are not fools!."
1,Stupid and silly author. This book is out of ranking....ZERO,"I need to strongly tell everyone chiropractic is a science with proved treatment result. I was a chiropractic patient before with chronic low back pain caused by sciatica. My doctor-chiropractor helped me to relieved my pain and treated me right. Now my pain is gone. Who said chiropractic not work ? All kind of scientific chiropractic jounals are available. Those treatment had been proved for treating low back pain. It is a scientific fact ! Chiropractic is a science with philosophy, just same as conventional Medicine. I am very happy after chiropractic treatment. GOOD DOCTOR OF CHIROPRACTIC !"
1,Grow Up!!,The author needs to grow up and open his eyes. This book shows me how the monopoly of medicine is frightened by other professions out there in the world that heal people without the use of drugs.
1,The true victims are those who buy this ridiculous book!,"Save your hard-earned money and buy a book that has actual substance and truth. This author claims to provide research and proof of his theories, but comes no where close to anything of the sort. Absolute nonsense!"
1,I think the authors a quack. He lives in a glass house and,I think the authors a quack. He lives in a glass house and continues to throw stones. My back improved immensly under chiropractic care
1,Author has an agenda without any valid facts,"It's obvious that the author of this book has an agenda that originates from his inability to treat his patient's as effectively as chiropractors. I've been a chiropractic patient for years and glad to say it's helped me. By the way, I'm an M.D. myself and I specialize in neurology. I counldn't imagine not referring my patient's to a chiropactor. It's the only tool I have for my injured back patient's."
1,This book was tough to read!,"Being a Chiropractor, this tasteless work-of-art(less) proves there are illiterate people trying to write books about something they know nothing about."
1,Bonfire Material,"Anyone who has read this book has read these reviews, I hope. Anyone who was a beleiver of bashing Chiropractic before,should agree by now that you have no business listening to one man's disgust for a great natural healthcare that just didn't work for him. Perhaps he fails to tell us all of the fact that he didn't follow his Chiropractor's treatment plan and wouldn't take any responsibility for his own health. Its refreshhing to see all of you bash him back and set the story straight. I too am a Chiropractor and have made my decision to get people well rather than medicate them into disease or manipulate them from a weekend crash course. ""Enuf said"""
1,A book that is almost laughable,"A one-sided book that offered very little to explain whatchiropractic is. Not only that, it never discussed the success ofchiropractic. Medicine and medical doctors kill tens of thousands of people each year with dangerous treatments and drugs, yet they quickly dismiss the field of chiropractic. I have Stephen Barrett's work for twenty years, and he never portrays the good points of anything that may detract from the success of medical doctors. If you want a one-sided book that does nothing to tell the truth about chiropractic, you will probably like this book. But check it out in a library first."
1,find out the truth for yourself,"This book is one of the most biased and least truthful of any indictment against chiropractic. I have been a chiropractic patient for the last 30 yrs and have not had one bad reaction from a Chiropractic adjustment. I wish I could say that about most medicines and I'm sure those 100.000+ patients who died last year and will die this year because of adverse drug reactions could say that(listed as the 4th - 6th leading cause of death in the U.S., just behind heart attacks, stroke and cancer). And for all those who think this is an exaggeration check out New England Journal of Medicine, July 1998. It speaks for itself on better living through chemistry."
1,Duplication warning,"There is a substantial duplication of titles on this DVD in the Three Disc Set ""The Christmas Collection"", with some but not very many differences. If you've already ordered the Christmas Collection, this DVD is pretty much reinventing the Wheel"
4,Beware! This one is copyrighted.,Bought this intending on showing a small group of people (but bigger than a private in-home viewing) and to my dismay there is a copyright because there was some restoration done. Very disappointed. Cute cartoons though.
1,THE WORST CHRISTMAS ALBUM I'VE EVER HEARD!!!,"I think what she did to ""Mary Did You KNow""...the most beautiful Christmas Song ever written.....is unforgiveable. She massacred it!!! But then the entire album is a massacred effort anyhow. Wanna hear ""Up On the Houstop"" as a rock tune replete with loud drums and electric guitars??? Get this! You'll like it. And if you like Christmas (???) Music that sounds like normal every day pop music, then Reba has a deal for you here!!"
1,WHEN I LISTEN TO CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"I want to hear sleigh bells, church bells, sounds that sound like winter. Not drums, electric guitars and loud rock and roll stuff! That's what most of this CD is with the exception of one or two tunes. I certainly would NOT get in a Christmas mood with this!!"
1,UGGH!!!,"There are no words to describe this god-awful Christmas CD put out by a good singer who could have done way better!! Most of the tunes are no different than her pop material (which she needs to give up) with the exception of ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"" which is outstanding. For that one, I'll give this CD One star! But that's being generous!!!"
4,More upbeat please...,"I don't have more than 1 christmas CD from country artists (and I'm big on christmas and country) before I bought this CD but I bought Friday, October 13th and played it all the way threw, there were some nice songs, track 1 is really swingin' and I like the Angels song, but I really loved the short 2minute 10 second song, Up on the House Top. It's really upbeat and stickes in your head. If only there were some more upbeat songs. Some of the songs are too slow for my taste, PLEASE listen to the samples before you click the buy button. Christmas is a time to be merry and happy, slow songs just depress me."
5,vary good,I thought it was vary good.She put me in the holaday spearit already and it is only Sept.I would recomend it to anyone.
1,"OH WHAT SHE DID TO ""MARY DID YOU KNOW"".....","What Reba does to ""Mary Did You Know"" is beyond reproach!! She takes one of the most beautiful Christmas classics ever written and massacres it with her multiplication of syllables!! The rest isn't much better. I did enjoy ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"" but the rest...needs to be thrown away!!"
1,"SORRY PEOPLE, REBA MISSED ON THIS ONE!","When I think of Christmas Music I think of ""Lorrie Morgan's"" Christmas album, the one she did with the London Philharmonic. The songs here aren't bad but the production is no different than any other time of the year. Christmas music MUST sound CHRISTMASY in order to put me in the holiday mood. This CD just didn't do it for me. There were a couple of songs I liked such as ""Mary Did You Know"" and ""Up on the Housetop"" but for the most part, all the songs are just ordinary ballads that would fit on any Reba CD. If you want a really good Christmas CD buy Reba's first CD ""Merry Christmas to You"". That one earns five stars from me and more!! Also recommended for Christmas is Patty Loveless' masterpiece ""Mountain Christmas"" or the above mentioned ""Lorrie MOrgan Christmas Album""."
1,THIS IS A CHRISTMAS ALBUM??????,"I only heard one song that I liked and that was ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"" which is along the traditional feel that Reba's first Christmas album had. She totally butchered ""Up on THe Housetop"" by making it into a rock song. She never should have attempted ""Mary Did You Know"" because it is beyond her. The rest of the songs are forgetable and easily dismissed just like this album. I won't be playing this come Christmas."
1,OVERDONE NON-CHRISTMAS SOUNDING CD,"As are most of Reba's later CDs, this one is also overdone. The fact that it is a CHristmas offering is purely peripheral. The main thing is that its more overdone stuff of the pop element of which McEntire has been singing for all these years now. Nothing new is offered here and certainly it won't become a Christmas classic."
1,THE BELLS AREN'T RINGING ON THIS CD!,"This is NOT a Christmas CD at all, as some other reviewers have noted. Its another of Reba's Pop Mishmash. I hate the what she did to a beautiful song like ""Mary Did You Know"". Oh, she really butchered a classic Christmas song. The rest aren't any better except for maybe ""I Saw Mommie Kissing Santa Claus"" which sounds like it came from her first Christmas CD which is a good one compared to this."
1,WHERE'S THE HOLLY? WHERE ARE THE BELLS? WHERE'S THE SNOW?,Where are all the other things that can put us in a Christmas mood? You won't find them on this CD. It is just an ordinary contemporary pop CD. I couldn't get into the Christmas Spirit with this one at all.
5,Reba is a PHENOMENON!,"Reba is a PHENOMENON, proving once again that she is one of the BEST entertainers around with the ""Secret of Giving"". Her voice is just as amazing as she is. She dazzles you with her vocal stylings, acrobatics, and her heart. Once again this lady proves why she has been regarded as ""The Queen of Country Music"" and why she will forever hold that title!"
1,I HAVE TO AGREE,"It pains me when I have to rate a Reba product low. I've done so on a couple of her CDs that I just don't think made the mark. But this, as a Christmas CD, is very inferior compared to her first Christmas CD which I really love. Its too bad that she couldn't have picked better standards and better songs for this one and she could have incorporated some Christmas sounding stuff on here as well to set it apart from the stuff she usually does. There is nothing distinctive about this CD at all. I hoe she releases another Christmas CD in the future and that she does it in a ""classic"" way that sounds Christmasy...like Clay Aiken's Christmas CD or Patty Loveless' Mountain Christmas CD...those are incredible. This one is not."
5,Classic,Reba delivers a great 10 track cd filled with songs for the ages. I love all of the songs here. She puts her spin on all of the songs and it just nice to hear songs that are this good. I think everyone would like to add this to their collection because Reba does Christmas right.
1,NOT A GOOD CHRISTMAS CD.,"If you're going to record a Christmas CD..please then..make it sound Christmasy. This one fails on most counts with the exception of ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"". The rest is all bunk."
1,I BOUGHT THIS LAST YEAR AND....,"I played it once and shelved it. I may take it out again this year for maybe one or two songs on it. But I can't tell the difference between this CD or her ""secular"" stuff. This is definitely not in my qualifications for a Christmas album. Her first one was loads better."
1,No wonder its for 1.00 used!!,"This is not a Christmas CD! It is more of Reba's popish, foppish, malarky that she's been recording for more than 16 years now. Sure, the titles signify Christmas but that's about as Christmasy as this gets. The production values are terrible because the sound is just pop....not Christmasy at all....I prefer Reba's first Christmas CD ""Merry Christmas to You"" instead of this mess. Most diehard Reba fans will like this because its all 'pop'. What I can't figure out is why they call it a Christmas CD because that is not what I hear."
1,THE MUSIC HERE IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ON ANY SECULAR CD!,"This CD, a supposed Christmas CD, im most cases does not resemble anything Christmas at all except the theme of the songs. The production values and content here are NOT CHRISTMAS! I'm going to listen to ""Bing Crosby's White Christmas"" for a taste of what REAL CHRISTMAS music is!! I'm sorry Reba."
3,Christmas CD,Was great to hear Reba sing but disappointed in the song choices.. For holiday music expected more hymns but was great to hear Reba sing.
1,Disappointed,"Nothing special about the song performances. Doesn't elicit the Christmas feeling for me - feels more like Reba pop. No heart or soul in Reba's interpretations here. Too bad. I was especially interested in hearing Reba sing ""Mary, Did You Know?"", but I was disappointed. Lackluster. Love the cover though - Reba looks great, as always.Wow! I just noticed something! It's obvious that on September 29, 2005, Reba fans performed a good magic trick and changed the skew of the rating for this cd by stacking the deck with 5-star reviews. Shame! Plus the earliest reviews, particular those from the vague and numerous ""A Customer"" and those from the one-shot reviewers - who's ONLY review here on amazon.com (since 1999, no less) were for THIS cd - seem dubious as well. That explains the oddity of why reviewers here either really loved or really didn't like this cd, with scarce middle ground! Caveat emptor!"
5,MERRY CHRISTMAS...REBA STYLE!,"This is the best Merry Christmas I've ever gotten and Reba sings it out in a big way! Reba is GREAT on this release (as always) and it's no wonder it's been certified GOLD! It's an amazing collection of traditional and contemporary Christmas music! She even includes her son and his elementary class on the song ""The Angels Sang""! It's a great release!MERRY CHRISTMAS REBA!"
4,A Fine story by a Fine author!,"This is another one of Steel's good stories. i really enjoyed it . For one of the very few times, Steel makes the main character in the novel a guy! Bernie Fine is a young ambitiuos guy who works at Wolff's (department store)He had a number of failure love affairs and heart breaks, but then finds himself responsible for the store's california branch and meets the perfect person! Of course, life does not stay perfect and a series of tragic events change Bernie's life. If you're a Danielle Steel addict fan, like myself, you will find this story a ""Can't put it down!"""
5,"One of my favorites! More than ""just a romance"" novel!","I could read this book over and over! It includes everything that a full life should have...love, romance, sorrows, joys, children, animals, prosperity and happiness. This book's modern, true-to-life ups and downs are an inspiration to all of us who are seeking what is really important in life"
4,Entertaining and fascinating,"This book was a really fascinating story because it was about a woman and her daughter found happiness with a single man. It was really entertaining how all three of them tried to et along together becoming one big happy family. Until, the mother died the man and the little girl started their life together short one member. But, in the end they were still able to be strong. They found the courage that they need together"
5,Emotional Roller Coaster!,"Fine Things, in my opinion, is one of the best examples of Ms. Steel's writing. She clearly shows her talent with this one! Your heart automatically goes out to our hero, Bernie, as he expertly faces the never ending traumas in his lifetime. The tragic events that take place, yet the humorous dialogue given from Bernie's Jewish mother, help to shape Steel's best book yet!"
4,Fine Things,Danielle Steel has done another great job of making this story seem so real. Part of it was so sad but kept your interest to the very end.
5,The most beautiful love story I ever read!!!,I love all of Danielle Steel's books and this is my all time favorite! I seen the movie also and I cried during both! Bernie Fine is positively a womans dream caring for his dying wife and then fighting to keep her daugther with him after she passes away. Truly heartwarming. A must read book and also a must see movie!!
3,"Fine, this book defintely was not! Good, but not great.","Ms. Steel could have done much better on this novel, in my opinion. She just didn't have a real page turner this time, I'm sorry to say. I could barely force myself to turn the pages. And besides, who falls in love four times in their love and always swears of love, but finds it again ? I'm not so sure this is realistic."
2,Quite the dissapointment...,"I've heard so many wondrous things about this CD, and must say was very dissapointed when I actually got it. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE noise/experimental music, but the only thing this album is is kids just playing guitars and other stuff completely at random, there's no 'intelligence' or thought behind the recording, in my opinion. I think I'll stick with bands like Tribes of Neurot and Hovercraft, thank you very much. And as far as being a pioneering experimental album goes, Pink Floyd did MUCH better stuff a decade earlier..."
5,Unforgettable you!,This really takes me down memory lane! I suppose you have to be 40 or higher to remember Guy Lombardo and his Canadians playing Auld Land Syne each New Years Eve.I bought this as an introduction to some older music for my children (still young enough to not rebel or ignore us with iPods plugged in!).They love 'Embracable You' - as it is quite festive and fun to hear.
4,Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians,"This is a wonderful upbeat, band music of yesteryear. This contains a wonderful beat as well as setting a wonderful mellow mood."
3,"Good Value, Good Sound","The remote was hard to use. It got hear really fast, andit was very easy to assmeble. I only don't like the fact that once I start having problems with the VCR/DVD It is all useless. If I had to do it over again, I would."
5,Good Value - Lots of Features,"The Panasonic SC-HT800V is an excellent value for the money. It delivers ample power to the speakers. There are more powerful units, but this unit fills the living room with clear sound. The speakers, subwoofer and main unit are easy to hook up, but I had to work at getting my TV to work properly with both the DVD and VCR outputs. I was able to attach a 5 disk CD player to the system after some fiddling. This unit is loaded with features and it takes time to learn how to use them effectively. I need to refer to the owner's manual frequently for the first few days of use. After the initial learning curve, I am able to enjoy this system. It works wonderfully."
4,Good System,"I just bought this system, and my wife and I both like it very much. It has great sound and is pretty easy to hook up. It also has many nice features. Learning to use the remote takes a bit of study. When the sound volume is adjusted up, the corresponding numbers on the display decrease and vice versa for adjusting the volume down. I thought something was wrong so I called Panasonic and was told the reaction is correct. Also, if your TV has picture in picture (PIP) you will have sound from both the main screen and the PIP when the PIP is activated and you swap screens."
1,Quit working after a month,"After a month, the unit (SC-HT800V) would turn off as soon as I turned the unit on.After troubleshooting, unplugging and replugging, I figured out it had something to do with the connection from the base unit to the subwoofer. Since the all the speaker connectors are on the subwoofer instead of the base unit, I have no speakers.The DVD and VHS will still work if I use the tv's speakers.The tuner won't work unless connected to the sub, so no tuner."
4,Stylish and Crystal Clear!,"Sound Quality: Crystal clear (even with the provided speaker cables), but subwoofer is far too weak (THX lovers look for some other system)Style: Perfect fit and finish silver parts. Speechless.Ease of installation: 1hr / Easy (Instructions are clear with pictures)Conclusion: Stylish clear sounding system, but lacks bass. DVD player works with ALL of my DVD's and the features are sufficient."
2,Long? Not really...,"Nice watchband, but not long enough. I had to go back to Sears to buy one that fit--this may be longer than a regular, but it won't fit a ""plus size"" woman."
4,Two-Hole Punch,"Not much to say - the product is sturdy, dependable, good quality, and works consistently. What more can you ask for? No problems with the purchase or delivery."
1,"POOR, POOR, POOR","Mine is going to the junkyard as soon as I get another one from someone else. POOR Precision (arm notches do not allow for even hole spacing), POOR Alignment (holes are not the same distance from the top edge of the paper) and POOR Quality (one punch rarely cuts through paper without leaving a hanging chad). I'm tired of having to use hole reinforcements on almost every sheet. I haven't tried, but it's hard to believe mine would punch through 25 sheets without getting hung up on the bad punch. The material is good quality, but that is all I can say good about it."
3,Fair Deal,"Because of the usability and price, this product is ok despite one odd thing about it. The sliding steel arm is set to measure in the wrong direction. It's almost like the original picture (but they've since changed the photo) except the numbers are on the other side and facing in the other direction. The arm that I got was meant to be inserted on the other side. Even the tilt of the upper arm runs in the opposite direction. I've showed others and nobody has seen anything like it before. But it doesn't mean anything. The functionality is not changed at all. I wonder if this oddity is what resulted in this item being cheaper."
5,Hole Punch,For the price you can't complain. It gets the job done and seems that it will last for a very long time.
5,Hubby's work,"this was purchased for my husband's home office. Works well. accurate. he uses it all the time and doesn't mess with my 3 hole punch anymore, getting it out of alignment. thanks amazon"
4,Great,"We use this with the Pressboard Classification Folders, Letter, 6-Section, Ruby Red, 10/bx. Just use a scrap piece of paper to adjust the arm to center the page where you want it in the file and use a sharpie and mark that spot on the internal ruler and you'll always have even pages."
5,Two-hole paper punch,"This is as advertised. It is heavy duty, well made and works as intended to punch 2 holes in paper to be held in a binder with metal clips at the top. It is heavy, in keeping with its high quality construction."
1,Never got this item,"Never got this item, was not available to view. I hate wasting money. They want more words, now wasting my time."
3,Disappointing ending to an excellent series,"The break down in character and story continuity began in the last episode with Dr's Holt and Kate finally kissing. One would expect a cogent follow up in this episode. Instead, there is the unlikely week long avoidance of Michael to discuss the situation with Kate who is in an equally confusing pre-divorce condition with her alternately angry then desirous husband. On top of this is buried the transplanted heart of Michael's ex-wife/ghost in a clinica patient ending in a fiery conclusion. The emotions emanating from Michael after this terrible incident in which the patient dies, along with Anna's heart, are never resolved, only eluded to, and the ending feels confused, convoluted and very unsatisfactory. I really like this series and feel its final episode deserved much, much better."
2,Disappointed,"We thought this would be a good toaster oven because you can take the inside out and stick it in the dishwasher. That part is OK. But the top of the toaster oven warped from the heat. Also, my toast comes out very cooked on one side and not so cooked on the other. It also has steam that comes out of the top of it."
4,Harlequin with a twist,"I really enjoyed reading this book by Helen Brooks. The hero of the book falls in love with the heroine, Fabia, immediately-but she does not trust any man, and keeps him at arm's length for a very long time. What I found different was her ""I can take him or leave him"" attitude, instead of the sometimes sappy love-lorn heroines. This girl is a toughie, and gives our hero a run for his money! Delightful."
4,She pulled the wool over his eyes!,This is the first book I have read where the main woman has nerve to do what she did - to a very eligible and wealthy bachelor. The story line is different but the ending was sweet.
3,Well-done and Interesting,"This is a rare cd of Maureen O'Hara, the famous actress from Hollywood's glory days, singing. And singing she does, flawlessly. Her diction is perfect and her voice quality beautiful. The songs selected for the cd are not very well known and they seem to be along the lines of a light jazz style. The songs are all in a surprisingly low key, so as far as the songs are concerned, I wasn't too fond of them. As far as Maureen O'Hara's voice is concerned, I was very much impressed."
4,Minnie and Moskowitz,"The wonderful running commentary by Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassell as they re-watch the movie doubles the worth of the DVD. A second watching also brings out the comedy of the dialogue, and makes you appreciate Seymour Cassell's hard-working performance."
3,not rapid,"of course this book and his grammar are valuable I think they are a little bit boring.First of all, Sanskrit Grammar and Roots, Verb Forms are written without devanagari scripts.For this reason one may use Introduction to Sanskrit 2 by Thomas Egenes because it gives the roots and the derivatives in devanagari though the roots are numerically fewer than that of Whitney's."
3,Where Is the Pacific War?,"This is a well-illustrated overview of World War II if your main interest is in the European and African campaigns. Unfortunately, like so many other books about the war, the Pacific campaign is treated as an afterthought. In this book the Pacific rates about 20% of the text. For the Europe-Africa campaigns this book is a four. For the Pacific campaign it is about one-and-a-half."
5,Good Short History of WW II,"I bought this for a WW II history clas I took. It's not an in depth recount of the war. But, it covers the ground fairly well."
4,Case not like photo,The photo that goes with this case is not at all like what will be sent. Case is red/black. Comes with armband and waist holder. Waist holder has two spots for back up batteries. Over all an OK case. Could be more secure.
2,Wrong case,The case in the picture is all black and looks like leather. The one I received is black and red and looks nothing like the picture. I looked carefully through all the different cases before choosing this case which cost more money than some of the others. I paid more money for this case and received the wrong case. I chose to keep it because it is functional and it is a hassle to send things back. I must say I am not happy about it but will use it anyway.
5,Television Field Production and Reporting,This publications has most all of the information I was looking for and it is written in terms easily understood. It gives a good foundation for moving in to a more indepth study of each area.
2,This party .... !,"This attempt to give Monopoly fans an entertaining experience in a PS2 console is an absolute failure. The graphics are sub-standard (you must have a 50+inch TV in order to read the titles), the gameplay is simple and not very interactive (just press X to roll, press X to buy, and you will be pressing X for a long time with no real interaction with the game. The animations are dull (when the hat moves you have to wait a longgg time before it arrives to its final square...obviously, you could turn the animations off, but that would just make the game even sleepier...)If you were waiting for a Monopoly game such as the ones made for PCs, this is not the case. Maybe you should wait for another PS2 version of this great game."
3,decent sound but not great,"OK - I hate to say it... but you get what you pay for. I paid $$$ for mine from [local store] in Burnsville MN. The sound from my Panasonic SC-PM28 bookshelf stereo just isn't as robust and full as other bookshelf systems I have heard. The sound is OK... good clarity in upper and middle tones but the bass is on the weak side. Listening to vocal music the system sounds fine, but get into more complex music such as classical and the sound is a little flat - almost like the system can't deliver the full richness and complete range from low bass to high. Other disappointment is you cannot put different speakers on this system. Salesman told me it would wreck both the stereo and the better quality speakers. If you are on a budget and really can't spend more than $$$ this is a good system... but if you can afford it, you will be more satisfied with something that has better quality speakers."
3,"Sound clarity very good, but needs more bass","I'll agree with some of the reviews above. I bought it because it has a lot of nice features for the price and doesn't look like the prize possesion of a teenage metalhead. I can't detect any distortion at all at any reasonable volume, but the sound does lack some fullness. A bass-boost feature like many small stereos have now would have helped a lot, but maybe the speakers couldn't handle it."
2,It worked more than year.,This one was my last Panasonic item. It did work but just one year+. I stopped buying any Panasonic electronics. I don't know if Panasonic quality is much better in any other price range.
4,pleasantl surprised,I am a retired person living in an appartment and needed a new CD/tape player. After much searching I settled on this Panasonic bookshelf system. When I got the productm it was very easy to install and the operating instructing where very adequate. The sound quality is very good and there are enough options to set the sound balance to satisfy to most selctive. I feel this system is a very good quality for the price.
1,inferior product,"I typically would not write a review on any product unless it is unusually great or very disappointedly poor in quality or function. The latter brings me to this fourm. I had enjoyed this unit in my office for about 16 months when, one day, the CD player simply refused to work any longer. The display panel would only state ""CD CHANGE"" for any of the 5 CD buttons pressed. No mention in the manual or on the Panasonic site has referenced this malfunction and since I primarily use the CD player this unit is now destined for the trash. The addvertisement for this unit should read ""disposable"" after 16 months. I'll buy an Onkyo next and hold my breath."
2,disappointingly difficult to use,"This is the most difficult CD changer I've ever used!!!I'm the type of person who likes to pop in a CD and start listening. This simple act is nearly impossible with the PM-28's five cd loader. One cannot see what is in each tray unless you cycle through them all. Moreover, I have not yet been able to change a disc while listening to another. Another annoying feature is that too many functions are controlled from the remote. Cycling between CD's is way too time consuming. What's more, the random feature does not operate on MP3's so you HAVE to listen all 100 or so songs on your disc in order. Lastly, each time you unplug the machine, you HAVE to reset the clock, or a Panasonic ad scrolls constantly.All in all, one of the most disappointing purchases I have made in a long time."
1,Sounds great but a big let down,Me and my wife bought the JVC camcorder and burner set up to send dvd's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time. At first it worked great then after 2-3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc. We have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10. We returned it to get another and it did the same thing. WE thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal. I do not recommend this to anyone.
1,Piece of Junk,"What a horrible piece of junk. Used it twice and then it stopped working. Looked on line for any tips to fix it and found one site that had 30 other people stating they had the same problem. Do not buy this, you will be sorry."
1,"Date on still photo,","Date on still photo will not print,it's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo."
3,McCracklin Update,"To update the information from the former reviewer:There is in fact a CD compilation that includes all of McCracklin's hits, as recounted below. It's the ""The Walk: Jimmy McCracklin at his best,"" released on the Razor & Tie label. It can be found here on Amazon.Moreover, the ""Yesterday Is Gone"" album, that the previous reviewer rightly praises as one McCracklin's very best, is available on CD under the name ""High On The Blues"" (available on Amazon).With these two CDs you are set up to get familiar with the very best work of one of the the very best blues singers/writers."
4,Awesome set.,"The Pirate Island has a cave with leaves that can be moved to hide or reveal who's inside; up on the cliffs, there's a gopher who peeks out. The crocogator has a pleasant smile, and he's lots of fun. My two-year-old sniffs the palm tree because that's what we do with flowers, and he says the tree smells nice (although it actually has a rather unpleasant plasticky smell). A great addition to the Little People world!"
3,Best if used with Pirate Ship,"My 2 year old son enjoys this toy, but doesn't offer enough variety on its own, it is more fun to use with the Pirate Ship. A big plus is that this set comes with an alligator - for some reason this is more popular than the pirate! Overall, like all Little People toys, the quality is excellent, and it's a good value."
3,fun,"Pluses:- Shows a wide range of kitchen types, small to large, workshop-like to slick, down-home to unbelievably fastidious.- Lots of pretty pictures, including useful cabinet detail etc. A few of the chapters (e.g. Tom Douglas) give you a feeling for what it's like to work in that kitchen.- Floor plansMinuses:- The text is a series of _People Magazine_-style profiles about what swell folks these chefs are, sprinkled with crumbs of design advice. It would have been easy, given the advertised qualifications of the authors, to put a chapter at the end synthesizing the design principles or at least talking through what they had picked up. Nope.- You have to be pretty affluent to benefit from the appliance advice, and most of these kitchens, though in homes, are set up to feed large numbers."
5,What do you really want in your new kitchen?,"After reading this book, I realized that part of me wanted a kitchen that would impress others. That aim partly conflicted with my personal aesthetic preferences and the way I like to live and cook. What inspired me the most in this book was seeing kitchens for cooks I revere. The diversity of kitchens is refreshing because many of the design magazines these days are focused on particular ""looks."" The pictures in the book are very good. Paul Bertolli's kitchen is interesting in that it doesn't have upper cabinets. I never considered not having upper cabinets, but it made the space feel much brighter and larger. The author also presents a floor plan for each kitchen and I found this really helpful for understanding kitchen dynamics."
5,Full of brilliant ideas that are actually useful!,"Finally a book with some ""meat and potatoes"" content that is enhanced with beautiful photography and actual floorplans! Not just a book of pretty pictures that have little to do with actual cooking. These kitchens combine the best of design, performance and above all, personality. The written background is also fascinating and really gets into these chef's heads about their approaches to their own, personal kitchens. When's Book TWO?!!!"
5,The best kitchen design book...,"Because we're planning to remodel the kitchen, I've looked at many kitchen design books. This is the best one! It has great ideas. It has floor plans. The featured chefs even talk about the mistakes they think they made when they designed their kitchens. These are grand kitchens. Even if you want to do something more modest, you'll appreciate the ideas in this book. We've all cooked in kitchens that are just plain badly designed. These kitchens were planned by people who really cook. If you don't have a kitchen remodel in your future, put this book on your coffee table. Everyone will enjoy looking at it."
5,Excellent Kitchen Planning Book,"This is hands-down the best kitchen planning and design book I have seen. I learned so many things from it about picking materials, lighting, fixtures, sinks, layouts, etc. that my remodeled kitchen will be better because of it. I paged through endless books and magazines filled with lovely photos, but that lacked information or substance. This book stands out because it discusses pros and cons, budget tradeoffs made, the good decisions and ""if-I-had-it-to-do-over-again"" mistakes. These are kitchens put together by demanding professionals who won't tolerate (bad)or lightweight materials that are hard to clean. I learned many lessons about flooring, countertops, backsplashes and so on that were never touched upon by other books. Sure there are appliances to drool over, but there are also chefs who ran out of money during the remodel, or bought factory seconds tile to save money. Real-life issues and lessons."
1,"OLD stuff USE w/OLD OS (Windows 2000, maybe XP)","OLD stuff,so USE w/OLD OS (Windows 2000, maybe XP)Low rating due to no warning this is NOT compatible with VISTA, WIN 7 or WIN 8. No serial number available either."
5,Purchased as gift,This book was recommended to me and I purchased it as a gift for a student of algebra. It is not the regular text book but it is helping the student. The student has told me several times how it has helped her.
2,Errors,"As I keep working through this book, I keep coming across little errors that make it frustrating to use. I know I make typos forget to carry over an exponent, etc. I can always work back through and find where I went wrong. Mostly the errors in the book seem to be with exponents xy^2 becoming x^2y. I can accept books have errors, and math books in particular, but cannot accept there is no corrections information available to let me know when I've truly done something wrong, or the book has. Hence, the low score. It really isn't worth the frustration of finding out you were correct and the book was wrong."
2,Not particularly helpful,"I didn't find the explanations very helpful, thorough or easy to understand. It seems that it would be appropriate for someone with fairly good math skills, but not for someone that is having problems grasping algebra or struggling with it. I am very disappointed with it as I didn't find it as what it is promoted to be."
3,Need a Backup Book,"On page 45 of this book, we have""Adding and Subtracting Fractions with Variables""When adding or subtracting fractions with variables, treat the variables as if they were prime numbers.""example--6/25 + y/4 = 6/25 x 4/4 + y/4 x 25/25=She lost me here--there's no explanation of how or why she did this. I think she should have explained what she was doing and why.Basically I can get the same result by cross-multiplying and making that the numerator and then multiplying the denominator.I'll never know what the concept is unless I get another book."
1,"Garbage, really not worth the paper it is printed on.","Think of this book as a work book. It is full of problems and answers, It should be called algebra obfuscated. I would like my money back from the author.Very few people will warn you about a bad book and I wonder how many people write reviews other then the people selling the books."
4,Very Good for the Gifted Child,"Some parents whose math skills are fresh, such as those in the sciences or engineering, may feel frustrated with the mediocre math instruction in their child's school. My daughter is a quick study with math, and not stimulated enough at school. I use this book for its wide variety of problems. I don't really care that the solutions are there; it is just wonderful to have someone else who has already created all the problems --- including word problems of many different flavors. The book is nicely laid out in bite-sized chunks (good for 20 minutes worth of work after dinner), so you can just work through a batch of problems to drill one technique into your memory. This is a part of my family time with my 12-year old daughter, and this book (with a few others) has moved her way way ahead."
5,Great game that doesn't require batteries!!!,My kids love these ThinkFun games. And I love that they love them because it gets them away from video games and batteries!!!
4,Fun Gift,"I bought these for our 3 year old granddaughter and she loves playing with it, the cards that come with it are a little challenging for her but she definitely tries to complete the puzzle. Although our 5 yr old granddaughter loves the card challenges and can complete them easily. You should try them."
4,See God Operating Through Science,"Sixty short chapters make up the book Our Place in Space. Each chapter describes something from the world of science that relates to a theme about your life and God. A Bible verse and a thought to remember are provided for each chapter. Vocabulary words which may stretch your information are placed in bold type. There is an activity with each reading. To encourage further study there is a challenge to Dig Deeper. Scientifically accurate this book is especially valuable because it helps the student see God operating through science. Designed for six to 6 to 12 year olds, the material is also interesting for older people."
1,Broke with first use,The plastic broke with the first use and it arrived without the pressure point inserts. Very disappointed with the product. The company has excellent customer service but the product was cheap.
1,Works great ... for a little while,"It did what it should. Then, on the third day of use while retracting the screw the cheap plastic bolt just busted in half."
1,Piece of junk,"It only lasted 30 min. It still stretches lengthwise, but won't move widthwise.This is so not worth it. I should have bought something better made."
2,Not what I thought it was - seems cheap,"I have wide feet a bought this to stretch the width of some of my heeled shoes. The listed didn't specify that this was for flat shoes only and I don't know anything about shoe stretchers so didn't realize it myself. When I got it, I quickly realized that it wouldn't work on my high heeled shoes (you need one that's tilted at an angle to fit properly in the shoe while stretching it). The plastic just made it seem cheap and like it wasn't going to last long. I quickly returned it and found a wooden one for high heels on another website (amazon didn't sell it). I have it and love it. I would suggest getting a wooden one as the quality is much better and it seems like it will last much longer."
5,Shoe strecher that streches,This shoe strecher was the right size. It is easy to operate. It is light weight. You can hang it up when not in use.
1,Broke after first try,The item is plastic and flimsy. After stretching my first pair of shoes the shoe stretcher broke. JUNK. Junk. Junk. Junk!
3,not a miracle,This device does not make miracles. If your shoes are way too tight or made of rubber shoes material you can use this device to loosen it a little bit but not a lot. I have wide feet over 2e but I still had difficulty in getting a 2e to loosen up a little to a fit my feet. I found out that my casual wear mocs loosened up but reverted back a little after I took this device off overnight.
1,Cheap Plastic Stretcher,"I liked FootSmart products a lot. But this is just poor quality. What they don tell you, it made of plastic, not wood and metal like the better ones. the length device broke the 2nd time i used it. Do not buy a plastic stretcher.And always wet the shoe before you stretch it."
1,Light unusable plastic product,"This stretcher, although two way, held up for two stretches before failing. Its about as cheap as you can make something without it being total garbage. No where in the description does it say its hollow plastic, and the pictures are low res and small so you don't necessarily realize what you are buying. To stretch leather shoes, you have to apply a pretty fair amount of push, and thats not really possible with this item. Its also priced similarly to toe box stretchers, so its not that great of deal when you realize what you actually bought.I have not bought from FootSmart before, and this first impression leaves much to be desired. Had they noted it was plastic and ""inexpensive"" I would have opted for a heavy duty wood one instead."
2,Very cheaply made,Like other reviewers I found this item to be of very poor quality - the plastic actually looked used/chewed up when i took it out of the box. The stretch function is very cheaply made and didn't adjust out of the box. I am very diappointed and sending it back - I'll pay up for the wood one now.
3,Just OK,"I love Kashi's granola bars. Can't say the same for the crackers. They're ok, but not great. I will try them again, though."
3,Quality has gone down - due to wheels.,"I have two of these Contico tool box. The first one I had lasted a long time. It is light and cheap. Made out of plastic, so easy to haul around. The handle on the top is not really necessary. Because if ure toolbox is full and heavy, the handle will break off. Don't expect too much from this toolbox, as it is not rugged, but it sure beats carrying around a bucket or box w/o wheels.The new one I ordered from Amazon is the same box & handles. The color is reversed. Yellow for the base and black for the cover (as pictured). The old one, the colors were vice-sersa. The wheels are now some sucky wheel that does not fit well. It makes the tool box wobbly when rolling it around. I had to change it out with lawn mower wheels bought separately from Home Depot.Suggestion to manufacturer: change back to the original wheels on the older box. I think those wheels were cheaper than the new ones, but performed the way it should."
3,Looking forward to more.,"This is my first by Dorothy Simpson (although there are now more than a dozen in the series) but definitely a series worth pursuing. The protagonist, Luke Thanet, is a no-nonsense, down-to-earth police officer. He is an easy-going family man who methodically works his way through his cases until coming up with the end result by process of elimination. In this book, the murder of a young housewife may or may not be tied into another murder that took place over two decades before. Simpson's descriptions of the English countryside, towns, and villages add so much to the story; you can almost picture being there."
4,Still Holds Up to Today's Standards,"This is the first in the Inspector Thant Series originally published in 1981. Even though it is over 25 years old, it still holds up to today's standards.Inspector Like Thanet is called into investigate the brutal death of Julie a young housewife murdered in her own home. Though married, this beautiful woman had many men interested in her, yet she seemed to spurn them all. Digging further, Thanet finds many similarities to a murder some twenty years before when a then three year old Julie witnesses a murder. Thanet must decide if her past caught up with her and whether a conniving murderer plotted their revenge.This is a great series. Don't think you need to read them in order since I haven't and I don't seem to have missed anything.The books aren't easy to find but well worth the hunt."
5,LUKE THANET IS GREAT!!,"I AM TRYING TO READ ALL OF DOROTHY SIMPSON'S ""INSPECTOR LUKE THANET"" STORIES, AND EVEN THO I AM NOT READING THEM IN ORDER, THEY ARE STILL GREAT!! IF YOU LIKE BRITISH POLICE PROCEDURALS, THIS IS THE SERIES FOR YOU, ALSO LUKE HAS A FAMILY AND SEEMS TO BE A NORMAL GUY....THAT'S A CHANGE FROM THE NEUROTIC INSPECTOR'S WE SOMETIMES ENCOUNTER IN FICTION. OH WELL, I LOVE THEM ALL, BUT THIS ONE IS SPECIAL!!"
2,Holy cheap flash lights.,I must admit I am pretty letdown with this purchase. Reminds me of something that would be 1/4 the price. Can't really tell much difference between the different settings. Do yourself a favor and go buy a Mag-Lite.
4,A good read,"A well told story which takes place primarily in Soviet-Georgia. It evokes the mystical side of Georgian life, along with the tragedy of Georgia under Soviet rule. A good complement to the book, if you're interested in Georgia, is the film ""A Chef in Love."""
5,sets the shelf on fire,What a read. The younger set will no doubt flock to the library shelves for this human account of a truly impressive woman. Did you know that Virginia Meachum won an ALA award for this book? Get thee to a bookseller and read Janet Reno!
3,A Fresh Review,"I am usually so excited to open the package of books I've found in my mail and immediately scan them. This one didn't excite me. I am just realizing how visually oriented I am. I opened this book and immediately put it in my give away pile. It's paperback with no interesting diagrams or pictures. Why now, at 53 years old, have picture books with slick, beautiful pages become so important to me? The information might be valuable, but the print did not entice me to read it at all. I got the feeling that it was very old and outdated. It's probably just the icky feeling of the paper. I love to underline and highlight my books, but don't like this kind of paper."
3,Not bad,This unit sounds ok but the head phones that came with it really cheapened it up. Good thing I had some others.Made a huge difference!
4,"Good value, great picture",Easy setup for cable. A fine basic television. Very heavy so have two people available for unpacking and set placement. Panasonic is a class act so batteries are included for the remote.
2,nice graphics no sega rally,first off no music! boring! second no jumps to get airborne. well some jumps but hardly anything to make u hold on to the controller like your actually steering a real car.I wanna hit start and race period.fine tunning come on...... emails ???? why do i need emails in a race game .the cars oversteer they dont bounce like they have shocks. will someone please tell me are there any rally games with correct physics like a real car . you know when a car goes over a bump the rear of the car goes up and down! is this a hard thing to program? rent this first. any recomendations that can top sega rally?
4,Fun but Flawed,V-rally 3 is a very good game with all of the real rally cars and real time damage.It is very realistic with changing weather and making sure you choose the right tyres and things like that. If you drive well you get offers from different teams but before you drive for them you have to pass a test.V-Rally 3 has it's flaws as well. At some stages you would slide slowly against something slanted and then go flying into the air and some other smaller glitches that don't really affect the gameplay.Overall V-Rally 3 is still fun to play
2,Not two of the best episodes...,"The series that had decent writing takes a break in these two episodes and enters the land of ""cliches and plot devices"". The Psycho-Bombs starts with an interesting theory that adrenelline driven people could do superhuman things but degenerates from there to the point that they can only be beaten by the heroes and that the aliens were too stupid to make more of them. ""Court-Martial"" is the story of the wrongly accused man who no one believes (except the main hero). It's an ok episode but really predictable with the usual cast you find in these kind of dramas. And of course the one ""amatuer detective"" that is able to deduct what all the investigators can't. You might want to give this one a miss but if you're trying to get the whole series, go ahead!"
4,"Worked well for ~4 years, INFO on track order!","Good value here. Compared to the Soundfly it lacks reception power (other stations override it more easily), features, and clarity. But then it costs 1/10 as much. I used one of these for years, that I paid much more for back in the day and was very happy with it. Recently was having issues with contacts in the hinge losing power but it actually seems to be working again.Tracks will play in the order you set them up in, so don't blame the manufacturer for that. If you order alphabetically they will play alphabetically. If you set up the folder to organize by ""date modified"" they will stay in the order you drag them onto the USB. If you click and drag from the middle of a selection that file will play first. Overall this performs better than I would expect given it's current price."
1,PURE JUNK!!!!,"Like a few of the other reviewers, I wanted this to work. Tired of flipping thru my MP3 discs. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!! Nothing at all. Tried all the channels and I know they work because I have an IPOD that I use in the car with the adapter. VERY VERY disappointed....."
1,don't buy,"I Just bought a one anf tried in sacramento area.The sound quality is really bad. I tried all channels and tried to reduce the volume too. You can't enjoy the music coming through this gadget, quality of sound is not good at all."
1,Do not buy this item,"I just received and tested this item. The idea and the design looked very attractive, especially the USB port. But ... Your guess is right! This modulator produces a lot of static noise and music and voice comes dull (I tried all 14 frequencies). Do not buy this item! I give my respect to the seller zibeta.com - they delivered it quickly - but I am going to return this item."
1,In a word - junk,I so wanted this to work. Sound quality is terrible and it doesn't play from my USB flash drive. It's going back to Target.I wonder how many of these things go back?
5,A much needed manual,"This comprehesive little book answers just about every question one could have about the Daily Office of the Episcopal Church-how to pray it, it's history, and theology. Especially helpful are the series of actual questions asked and answered at the end of the book.An increasing number of people seem to be praying the Daily Office, and there's a real need for a guide on how to do so, since most churches in the U.S. no longer offer it on Sundays or during the week, and at first glance it might appear to be complicated.I've been praying the Daily Office for over ten years, and wish this book had existed when I fist began. It has increased my appreciation for the Office and my knowledge of it, I've given it as a gift, and heartily recommend it."
1,Wrong age!,"I had to return this toy because the information given for it is incorrect. It says it is for ages 3 and up on this site, but when I received it the box says 8 and up."
5,Worth the premium?,"This is an expensive pen, too much in my opinion. That said, I love writing and drawing with this thing. It is beautiful, sits in your hand perfectly and just flows and flows. Also, this is oversized, a huge barrel, which makes each use seem special."
5,Great new Australian talent,The Australian pop explosion continues. Along with Natalie Imbruglia and Savage Garden we now have s2s. I know this song is cheesy pop but that's what makes it so good! It reminds us not to take life too seriously. Just relax and bop along to the music! Great for any pop lover
4,Too tight for comfortable access,"I had to open the side seam to accomadate my Dell Laptop. The inside pocket seam I opened up to expand the bag and am able to use it. I love the nice soft leather and the lovely pink color. Does not open to 6 inches wide at top of bag, but is 6 "" at the bottom. I was a little dissappointed but I modified the bag to fit my computer.."
4,These are great pants.,"Lite weight, sturdy, fast drying, what more can you ask for?I have a 38"" waist and order the large and had to exchange them for the extra large. That was a delay, but the process could not have been easier.And I love the pants."
3,Much Better than the other brand that I bought,It was the perfect size for my 19 month old. He was so ecstatic to play them!! Good value for your $$.
1,"Dented balls, low quality!",Buyer beware: this is a large bag of colorful but POORLY MADE and VERY dented balls! The set we received had so many dents and were so misshapen that many won't even roll around. I thought I would give them a try despite the reviews because its so hard to find a safe set to use with kids. Very disapointing.
4,Quick shipping great product,"The product was exactly as described. I ordered it before Christmas and the shipping time was on time as it said it would be. Very fast shipping, and the product was in excellent condition. New as described. The balls were very good, I did not realize how easily they could be dented however they did not stay dented, it was very easy to un dent them. THey were very lightweight and harmless to the child. Very good product"
2,easily broken and so big,this balls are so big for ball pool. and easily crushed..also smell was so strong. I will not buy again.
3,Fun Ballz,Everything about this order was good except most of the balls where soft in spots. I still used them and the kids had fun.
4,Inconsistent Quality,"I agree with the reviewers who've said these balls have inconsistent quality. I've bought three of these bags for a homemade wading-pool ball pit. The first two bags were full of nice, firm balls that would only dent if you tried to squish them hard with your thumb. I then ordered the third bag, and its balls are completely different -- the plastic on one or both halves is soft and flimsy and dents when the ball simply lands on something. I'm actually worried that some of the balls will end up tearing. I was very pleased with the first two bags but am considering returning the third -- so, caveat emptor."
4,Good size balls - decent quality,"We used these for my son's 2nd birthday party in a big, inflatable pool to have a ball pit for the kiddos. It was great! So far, the balls hold their shape, but they do get squished sometimes, but will round back out - but I can tell that, with a lot of being jumped and stepped on, they are thin and will flatten before too long, but we have them in a small ball pit inside and have been using them for a month now and they are holding shape pretty good - and they take a daily beating from our toddler :-)"
2,Not crush-proof,"I was looking for balls to place inside a playtent. I was disappointed to see that they were already a bit crushed when I received them. It doesn't take much strength to squeeze these light balls either. On the bright side, I'm sure that my daughter won't be hurt if she gets one on her head!"
3,Cheap Ball pit balls.,"I wasn't going to spend a fortune on balls for a ball pit for a one year old, so these fit the bill perfectly. If they get smooshed a little, the kids don't really care, since they are sitting on them, right?"
1,Smashed in balls,I would say 80% of the balls are smashed in. I personally consider this a complete waste of my money. I would return but 4 year old daughter has been waiting for these since I ordered them and she has seen the package so I cannot really return them.
5,happy balls onya,"I just received these balls today,I ordered them for my 9 month old wild child and she loves them.all 200 balls were in perfect condition and unlike other reviewers I was'nt going to complain if there were a couple of bad ones as long as my sweet doll likes them(she destroys every thing anyway)all I can say is that they arrived in a cardboard box and were exactly what I was expecting quality wise(100% satisfied)and if I ever need some more balls,I'll be ordering these again,I'll post back in a couple of months on the endurance of these balls,but so far they seem to be holding the weight of my fat a#% pretty good and that's over 180 pounds.buy with confidence."
2,pretty cheap construction,"Good thing you get so many - a lot of them ended up squashed under foot or furniture. These are not hard plastic, but very thin-walled and easy to destroy. Fun to throw around until you have to throw them away!!"
2,Balls arrive damaged and get worse,"These balls arrive dented and they continue to lose air as children play with them. I had thought they were the squishy kind that I could reinflate with a bicycle pump, but they are sealed plastic. The plastic is hard, although thin, which allows for the ""squish."" Won't last long. Intex claimed to have fixed this problem, but it is not fixed."
3,"""ok"" product","I bought these for my son to use with his therapist in his ball house. They are ok nothing really special about them. I have noticed that a few of them have been smashed by my toddler son who is 27 lbs fairly easily but nothing that you can pop back out. These do have a chemical smell to them when you get them but I all I did was dump them into the bathtub with some vinegar and it took the smell off quickly. P.S. 100 balls may seem like a lot but if you are using these in any kind of ball house, I highly suggest getting at the minimum 3 bags of them. I have a med size ball pit and these didn't even cover the floor of the toy."
1,Dented Balls,Balls were delivered dented. This was a gift for my 8 month old niece. My sister texted a picture to me right out the package and almost all of them were dented. This was not worth the money.
4,Ball fun,"These were required to complete the purchase of Lil Tikes Cozy Coupe Ball Pit. But remember the more balls you have, the more you have to pick up!"
5,He loves it.,"OH gosh this is too much balls in my house I had to put some away. at one point my 1 yr old threw it all around the house. I had to throw some away because i stepped on it & it smashed it. once it's smash there's no ball, just a flat plastic. My son loves it. I just think the 100 of them was too much."
5,Super fun!,I always wanted these when I was a kid! I bought these for my daughter (6 mos.) to use in an inflatable pool during the winter when we couldn't use water! Now she can use it year round! And it's really fun to bat around the balls with her and teach her colors and numbers! The price is real reasonable too! I would definitely recommend this product!
1,Balls arrived already crushed!,"So there were several reviews related to the durability of the balls, and many reported that the quality of the lot was inconsistent - some balls were more durable and thicker than others. We just received our shipment today, and many of the balls are already dented! We haven't even taken them out of the packaging yet! While there are some balls that obviously have a thicker wall, many are literally paper thin and vulnerable to the slightest pressure.I would not recommend this product unless you consider them disposable and for one use only. My family tries to reduce the amount of plastics we send to the landfill, so these will never be purchased again."
2,Not crush proof!,"If you are looking for crush prove balls, these are not the balls to buy. Don't bother buying these...they get crushed very easily!"
5,Simple ball pit balls,I got these for my son who is almost a year old. I wanted something for him to play with. I just bought the one bag and put about half of them in his pack and play. He loves playing with them and banging them together. The balls arrived and none were dented. They were all in great shape and still are. I don't know how they will last when he gets rougher with them but I am pleased with my purchase. They really don't hold much educational value except for teaching colors but he likes playing with them. When he gets older and can play in there on his own I'll probably pick up another pack or two and make a true ball pit but for now he is happy with half a pack in his pack and play.
1,CHEAP AND DENTED,"I purchased these balls to go with the Playhut Magic Ball Zone and I am very dissapointed, especially since these were the recommended balls suggested by Amazon. I cannot tell you which ones you should buy, but DO NOT buy these.- The balls are not the same size as the balls that come with the Playhut (not a big deal..minimal difference, really)- Almost all (80%-90%...really) of the balls came ""dented""...like they need more air in them or something, and the are very thin walled. They are just very cheap- They do come with a decent storeage bagLuckily, my one year old doesn't care a thing about dented balls, but I would have perferred something a little higher quality. These are the cheapest ones you can buy for a reason."
4,Balls for Toddlers used with Inflatable Gym,"Bought the balls to use with the inflatable play pen for a nine month-old grandson. Their size is just right for him to hold easily in one hand without slipping out - a defintie plus. The ball size also fits the ""idents"" in the inflatable bottom of the Soft Sides Play Gym. Some reviewers have said they use a lot of them to fill the pen for playing, our grandson prefers only about 35 in there with him. Any more and he has trouble moving around and getting up to play with other toys - like stuffed bears, etc. Worth the price."
4,Mostly good,"We bought these balls so that our daughter could turn her swimming pool into a ball pit when not able to swim. For the most part the balls are pretty firm, but about 10-15 came pretty deflated. They work for what we are using them for and we purchased them on sale so I'd say we are pretty pleased. I'd be unhappy though if bought at full price."
5,As advertised,"The balls are as described, 100 multi-colored balls for a ball pit. No complaint about this purchase. Thanks so much!"
4,Good Fun!,"Great value,nice bag for storage. The colors are nice and vibrant. I would definitelt recommend to purchase for any bouncers or ball pits."
2,bad quality balls,"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the balls. Out of the 100 balls, only 19 were in good condition. The other 81 were soft and dented. The balls actually seemed to be made of two different types of plastics. Most of them were a soft, thin plastic. A few, mostly the ones in good condition, seemed to be made of a harder plastic.I contacted the manufacturer about my disappointment. A representative called me the same day she received my letter! She said I should send some balls to their warehouse and they would replace them. I'm about to do that now. I'm curious to see what the quality of those balls are.Even though the balls are dented and soft, both my 1 and 3 1/2 year olds love playing with them in their tent! They don't care at all about the shape of the balls."
3,The balls were ok,"We recieved the balls but they came in a box, no tote bag as pictured , I was disapointed and the balls are somewhat squashed ,not all of them but most of them.other than that my son loves them."
1,Not as advertised,"One of the main reasons I picked these balls for my kids' ball pit was that it was advertised to be phthalate-free. But when I got the product, I couldn't verify that information anywhere on the packaging or on the balls themselves, which makes me fairly certain that they are not. The only thing I learned was that they were made in China. I'm very disappointed with Amazon for not verifying the ""product features"" that are listed on its site. If you're thinking of buying this product because it's phthalate-free, don't bother."
3,Great for indoor fun,"When we received them about half of the balls were already dented/going flat and the other half are great. The ones that were dented seem to be made of thinner plastic than the others. These are a great size, I just wish they were all the better quality."
5,more is better,I bought this as a gift for my neice and nephew to add to their ball pit I also ordered. More is always better!
1,Do not waste your money- only lasted 6 hours before they are already deflating,"We buy alot of ball pit balls and these really are awful. After we put them in the ball pit, I noticed that some already were dented and getting mashed up and that was just from being packed in tight in the carry bag. I have one child playing in a pretty decent size ball pit that we built. We buy new balls every 6 months or so and replace them and have been for about 5 years so I know how long they usually last. I don't think these will last a week."
4,Plenty of fun,These balls keep kids entertained for a long time. Wether inside a pool or spread all over your backyard. Only bad is that when fun is over the pick-up activity can be overwhelming if you buy 500 of them!
5,Wonderful,"not only my boy, other kids come to visit also love to jump into. Suggest to buy at least 4 bags if possible. Even that, still may not be enough to fill up play house."
4,Great price - good quality,I have a variety of different balls for my son's ball pit at home and these are well made and do not crush or peel apart like some of the other brands I've tried do.
4,Fun Balls!,"My twin toddlers love these! We dump them into an inflatable kiddie pool to make an impromptu ball pit. They are a nice size -- big enough so that they don't roll under the couch, but not too big. They do dent easily though and there isn't a way to pop the dents out. You'll want to keep them away from dogs; ours has chewed up some of the balls."
2,Low Quality,"These are very low quality, thin plastic made in China. Not that you should have high hopes for plastic ball-pit balls, but probably 20% of them came out of the package dented. They'll work fine I guess, since the kids don't care if there are dents, but I'm guessing that they won't last very long before they've all been crushed and must be replaced."
3,"Okay balls, kinda flimsy.","These balls are okay and they worked great for just topping off my daughter's ball pit. They tend to dent, but this isn't too much of a problem for us since they were more just filler balls and we purchased 200 to add to the 500 more durable ones we already had, so we don't notice too much. They served their purpose as a cheap addition for us, but they might be more of an annoyance if they were the main balls in the pit."
1,this just suck!!!,I bought this for my kids bal pit and after only a few hours most of them were crushes badly. They seemed to be made of some thin plastic. I got another pack of 250 smaller balls at toys r us for only $24 and those are very sturdy made in the US and after almost a week i have yet to find one of those crushed. Dont waste your money on these get some from toys r us.
3,Buy the playhut balls instead.,We bought these to use with the playhut magic ball zone. They dent easliy and the shipping cost more than the balls.
3,Just Plastic Balls,Really there's nothing to say about this item. They are plastic balls. Just like you'd find at a McDonalds play area.
5,Fun!,Great addition to the Little Tykes 'bouncy house' that we purchased. Adds some creativity to all that jumping and bouncing.
4,Misleading presentation picture,Unfortunately the picture shows some type of packaging and all I got was envelopes with the CD's. The information is very useful and helpful but I'm sure I could have bought this CD set used for much less instead of paying the Amazon premium.
4,Nice rock concert with his band,"If you like Yann Tiersen, this is a great live album to listen to the rock side of his music. I wish I could see them live."
4,Did not have the CD,"I bought this book used from an individual who said it was like new (not used). However, upon receiving the book, it did not contain the CD. If it was not used, were is the CD? I am very disappointed because I wanted the CD templates. That is the reason why I bought this book. I am trying to contact this person and hope she has and can forward the CD. Otherwise, I want to return the book and just buy it new.The book seems very interesting but it only teaches how to use FV, PV, NPV, etc, in MS Excel. It does not explain the meaning of using these functions in a business setting. For that, you need other books or take a class on Corporate Finance. So, this book is complimentary to any finance course you take.I like the fact that the author shows how to calculate NPV, etc. without using the NPV function from Excel, or uses both. It does educate us or reinforce our knowledge and understanding of finance."
3,Belle Hand Bag,"Great toy for my daughter, she carries this with her everywhere. Keeps it filled with the neccesities, her small dolls and figurines, she calls her ""little people""."
3,Good,"This was not as good as volume 1, but it is okay. It has some really good videos on it, but not a lot. I like 8 out of 14. Its nice to have it if you are into collecting them all. You should buy it so you dont miss the good videos/songs! If you dont have much money to spend, dont buy this."
4,Great,"Awesome 2 player fun. I have a PS3 and great gaming set up and I still have friends over to throw this in the 'ol PS2. If you use the HD cables you can get 480p out of it which looks a LOT better, surprisingly. I do this because I have a 90"" projector screen. Some PS2 games are 1080i, but a lot of people don't know that -- Gran Turismo 4 being one of few. Definitely buy this if you want an old school game to hop in without any skill and be able to have fun playing."
5,This Game Is The Best!!!!!!!,I played this game the other day and it was the best game ever i meen i played it 5 hours straight and i wanted to play 24 7 u should by this game it's worth every penny!!!!!!!
5,Fantastic!,This album was worth it for just the first two songs! I Know What I Want For Christmas and Old Time Christmas. And the 3rd. And 4th. And...Johnny Mathis has serious competition for best Christmas songs.
4,1989 release,1989 project by Sheila. Solid contemporary sound with excellent vocals on these songs: The Calling of Love; Come Into His Kingdom; Soli Deo Gloria; Love Alone; This Time (A Song for Norman); Where Do We Go From Here?; Savior Like a Shepherd; Quiet Times; We Can Have It All; God Loves You
5,Laptop Anyone?,The product is great.It works perfectly and the image quality is impressive.After using I wondered though if my $800 could have beenbetter spent on a Laptop computer with a DVD PlayerOther than that it is the best out on the market.
5,Absolutely GREAT!!!!,"We bought this 6 months ago and so far we love it! It's a perfect compact home theater, great technology and sound in a stylish and space-saving box. It goes great with our flat-screen TV and surround and DTS are awesome! I think this is a fantastic deal if you are looking for a good-quality system for a small space (we live in the city in a 1BR)."
2,Nice!...... when it works.,"Ive had my system just over a year now and it has just kicked the bucket. The door just stopped working on it and became very unreliable.Luckily i purchased an extended guarantee and it will be replaced but i will not replace it with the same system.It is a lovely bit of kit though maybe i was just unlucky.Sound WAS excellent,picture WAS excellent and system Was cool but unfortunatly as with alot of electronics these days it just decided to die. The part that is needed to fix it can no longer be got so im gonna have to trade.....fun while it lasted."
3,aNother Naughty Nebulous Nutty Nursey Noise,"Well actually, this album is pretty un-industrial, so therefore lacks lot of noise-as-such, unlike many of their other offerings.Using heaps of samples from the fifties, this is a is tongue-in-cheeky poke-in-the-eye to pop/easy-listening-or-viewing schlock. Another inspired Nursey romp! Good background listening, that would probably pall on repeat listening, but an essential CD for NWW completists (if you can get it - I found my copy on eBAy).However, this CD certainly doesn't rank with their best in my opinion. For 'Nursey beginners' it would be best to start with 'Sugar Fish Drink' (a personal fave and excellent value); 'Thunder Perfect Mind' (rivetting album and another fave); or 'Funeral Music for Perez Prado' (a varied and engaging album - the title track is a stunning industrial-edged organic-ambient masterpiece).MAKE SURE YOUR SMILE-METER IS TURNED ON IF YOU BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
2,Too much theory and not enough practical applications...,"The author spends half the book proving the theory in a very slow and boring fashion. As a business professional, I was expecting to get some more practical knowledge and not so much theory. Thankfully I bought the book used so all I was out was my time invested in reading it."
2,"um, it's LOADED WITH SUGAR, shoulda had a snickers heehee...","I could barely taste the flavor, it's so sweet.I gave two stars instead of only one because it's really my fault (not the maker) I did not doing my usual thorough research!A minimal google search would have uncovered the fact that sugar is ingredient #1 and corn syrup is #2 Yuk! I have to say, if something taste good, I could give a good gosh darn what the color is...they add red dye... oh why, or why must they add dye. Here's the ingredient list:Sugar, Corn Syrup, Natural Anise Flavor, Color Added (Including Red 40)Maybe I can crush em up, add flavor and something else to dilute sugar, they may be savable--oops! that's my hoarder tendency talking"
2,Just don't like it...,"I got this item for my son, for Chrismas, At first he started complaining that he couldn't finish the maze...In which I tried it and he was right... This game was awful in everyway... Sorry to be mean but I'm just being honest... I would not tell anyone to buy this item..."
3,ThinkFun Maze,"This is a sturdy item. My only disappointment was that I felt it was more suitable for a younger age, 3 or 4 years. My kindergartner and 1st grader quickly became bored with it, despite the ability to change the track of the maze. I think a younger child would have more fun with it more challenging and find it absorbing and entertaining."
2,Not much of a challenge....,"Not really what I thought it would be. You just slide levers back and forth. You aren't suppose to lift your stylus up, which isn't reliable. Making it to the end of the maze is challenging, but this maze is just too repetitive and too easy to cheat on and too easy to accidently lift your stylus and then have to start over."
1,piece of junk,"we received this and thought it was a great idea, but it is a very cheap piece of thin plastic"
2,nope,I was disappointed in this game. I purchased it as a Christmas gift and it just isn't what I thought it would be.
2,I don't like it,I don't like it and I don't want to recommend it to anyone. it's too cheap kind of toy for kids
3,Semi-aMaze-ing,"Please be aware that there is no little ball to move around this maze. Even though you see a stylus in the picture, the stylus is only for tracing through the maze. Also, my son (a self-proclaimed maze expert) and my husband (no slouch himself) found a problem with the lowest trap line. When you move the lowest trap line, all the mazes are effectively impossible. When I saw the stylus I thought there would be some cute little magnetic ball to push around the maze but no, no ball. And we believe the maze may be defective. Too bad."
2,"I thought he would like it, but he didn't","My 8 year old son likes making things and he likes mazes, so I thought he would enjoy manipulating paths on this movable maze. But he didn't. He fiddled with it for a few minutes, got frustrated, and never picked it up again. I picked it up, fiddled with it for a few minutes, got frustrated and never picked it up again. As did the rest of the family. I don't understand how it works and I never figured out how to create a clear path all the way through from beginning to the end of the maze. Maybe there were instructions that needed to be read. On the surface it seemed intuitive -- slide the little red things back and forth to change the internal walls of the maze in different places. It still sounds like fun reading the description but the reality wasn't."
2,Too small,"The paper size is half the size of the regular ones. It's good for on the go, but not good for daily use at home."
1,Be Careful,"These wipes are nice...kids like them and they really get the job done. BUT, be careful that you child does not over use them. They have tons of alcohol in them, and little ones will get a rash if they use them too often (so will adults, unfortunately)Also, kids want to use them on their face and this can cause a rash as well, which is very painful and hard to get rid of. Personally, I stopped using them because there are more gentle wipes on the market that won't cause as much discomfort."
1,not septic safe as product states,"These are wonderful to help in potty training and getting everything clean, but do NOT flush them as the packaging cleary states you can. 400$ later on a plumbing bill, and papmpers refuses to even acknoledge that their products could have caused this. My daughter never used more then the reccomended 1-2 wipes per flush, so that wasnt the problem. I would not reccomend this product unless you plan to just put them in the trash. And since I'll be putting them in the trashcan, its actually better to just use the sensitive baby wipes which don't have all the added alcohol/chemicals in them."
5,Best ever,"I hate to disagree with the other two reviews; however, after spending upwards of $40 for a power plunger from QVC I stumbled upon this and it is terrific for my problem. I love it and have recommended it to several friends. It does work at about 1/5 the cost of the pricer models."
1,Too big,The plunger is too big to fit into the base of our toilets and did not work in the slightest bit. I ended up going back to my Korky plunder and that did the trick.
4,Good Value,"Let me first say that all DVD players are not created equal. I once thought so until I bought a top-of-the-line 57"" HDTV rear projection television.I tried an older JVC DVD player and a newer Sony Progressive Scan DVD player, and both players performed poorly...neither had video processors srong enough to carry a sharp image across a large screen area.I decided to go with the Harmon Kardon DVD-25; the picture was and continues to be extremely satisfying, and it is a nice looking unit. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the HK DVD-25 plays a variety of formats.I would be lying to you if I told you it was the best; there are other DVD players out there that go for even more Benjamins than DVD-25 and likely perform better (such as Denon models and some Onkyo models), but if you're on a budget and you need a high-end DVD player that can muscle a sharp image onto a large HDTV, then Harmon Kardon is the way to go."
5,HK DVD 25 has best quality,"I have used several DVD players but this is by far the best quality of any. Don't believe it when someone says that all DVD players have the same quality picture, it just isn't true."
1,"it was a gift,they didn't know","as i have found with the other 20 packs the quailty on these are far below the 50 packs,and no john wayne movie to be found. i include that because his picture is on cover"
2,PRETTY BAD!,"I kept this camera for a short month before it got stolen, but in that brief time i was somewhat unpleased. The hard drive part of the camera was good, it sorts out all the videos for you so you can (as what all the advertisements say) keep shooting. The video quality was horrendous, i shot a few short films indoors and i just could not set the lighting right. It came out all fuzzy and the colors were bleak. Poor battery,too. Definitely stay away if you're an independent filmmaker or care at least somewhat about video quality and if you edit video. The editing systems was awful with the way they expected you to use only their drag and drop (lame) software. And transfering video files to the computer was slow thanks to the USB 2.0 and no firewire. It is sleek and small and has a nice video light, but i would caution most consumers to stay away. If you still like what you see, spend the extra $100 or so and get the MG77."
1,Do not buy this camera,"This camera is a big disappointment. I recorded outdoor in brightsun light with highest (fine) setting but the picture quality is about same as VCD, not even comparable with video tape, that how bad it is.Apparently JVC do not tell the truth when they said on their ads of DVDquality... It is no where near.I purchased from BestBuy and the selaman told me that I can try itfor 2 weeks... when I returned it, Bestbuy charge me 15% re-stocking fee(of course, the policy printed on the back of the receipt, but I canonly read it AFTER purchasing) which is more tha $70.00,what's a rip-off!!!"
2,Half the quality of a MiniDV,"The only advantage this camcorder has it size/media. That is it.While it has a 30gb HDD, which is certainly very convienent, the highest quality setting uses half of the bitrate of what a minidv would use. In addition, the artifacting is multiplied in lowlight conditions.You can use a USB cable to transfer the videos to your computer, to edit them.. but you have to use their software, or you will lose the audio. (What is wrong with just using MPG files?)Bottom line is:It's quite obvious that a HDD in a Camcorder is the way to go. But not until the video quality is comparable to what is out there now."
3,low light still bad,"I was waiting for the second generation to come out, hoping there would of been some improvments from the first generation hard disk camcorders.The good: looks and feels reel good. Easy to use, LOTS of room with the 30 gig drive. 32x zoom.The Bad: LOUSY low light! Maybe I'm spoiled. My first mini-dv camcorder was a JVC-GR-DVM70 that is now 7 years old. Compared to that camera, the GZMG37 is bad in low light. The other thing I was disapointed in is that the movie is NOT recored as MPEG2, but a .MOD file extention. SHAME ON YOU JVC for creating your own file extention and not using a standard MPEG file. If you search you'll find programs that will convert it to the standard mpeg.Bottom line...This camcorder is great except for low light recording. After looking at several other camcorder reviews that seems to be the biggest issue out there."
4,Not bad if you find a good deal,"Ok, so this isn't the highest quality camera on the market. But, it is light, easy to use, and has decent picture quality. If you've got the money, spulrge on a higher rated $600 camera or hold out until prices on hi def camcorders come down more. If you don't want to spend more than $400 or so, this is one of the best HDD cameras you can pick up."
3,blah blah blah,"I thought this book was going to be more interesting! NOT! Just goes to show, ""you cannot judge a book by it's cover"" or by it's topic."
4,Exciting.,"Wesley Snipes at his usual best, quite a few twists and turns and of course Lena Headey again is great."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I usually don't write that many reviews bit after seeing this movie, I gotta tell you,don't spending your time even watching it for free. It's not worth it. This movie is disgusting and horrible..."
1,reasonably weak,"a couple of reasonable action/fight scenes, but overall weak movie. Not worth the time to watch it."
3,Flawed but still entertaining,"The Contractor stars Wesley Snipes as an assassin who goes to London to kill a terrorist but gets framed for another murder. Set in London, it has a good supporting cast of English actors including Charles Dance, Lena Headey and young Eliza Bennett. For the most part, it's a standard action story, and the occasional dramatic scenes feel a bit out of place, especially those between the young girl and her grandmother. I would have liked less drama and more action from this type of movie. Also, the motivation of the bad guys is somewhat unclear. Still, it was entertaining enough for three stars."
2,Boring movie,"Save your time and money and go for ""The shooter"" instead of this boring movie. Wesley Snipes is cold as ice in this movie and I don't know how much he has been paid for this but its performance doesn't worth a penny."
1,Wow!!,"This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The story line was very similar to ""Shooter"" but the action and realism didn't compare. Overall it was pretty hard to sit through."
2,Lacking,"This book is a poor record of Black Sabbath's history. It lacks details and anecdotes and the writing is bland. The author didn't do very much research - there are not very many people quoted in the book. It relies way too heavily on information provided by Bill Ward, who was on drugs for most the 1970s. How reliable of a source is he? Maybe that explains the lack of details."
2,Book of confusion,"This book could have achieve much more than it did, had the writer spent mroe time really checking the facts. I had the impression the book was rushed to meet some dead-line, I don't know. Anyway, it's the best thing ever produced about Black Sabbath and it's worthwhile read for die-hard fans, only. It does not reach the quality of HAMMER OF THE GODS or RUN TO THE HILLS."
2,THE BAND DESERVED MORE THAN THIS ....,"Weak. It's the only word that comes through my mind after erading this book. IT should be placed "" BILL WARD "" as the writer, not Steven Rosen. All book long there are quotes by Ward. The other members appears, also, but the writing style is awful, very bad indeed. There's still room for someone else try to write the ultimate Sabbath biography .."
1,DISAPOINTING; WEAK; BADLY RESEARCHED...,"BAsed almost completely on interviews with drummer Bill Ward, the writer's narrative is boring."
4,Good,"Good explanation on how time spirals through the universe and your life. good stuf, but I have to reread it because there is so much some of it got by me."
2,too many dropped calls and gets too hot,"I'm on my second a727 because I thought the first one was faulty. Now, having the second one for 3 months, I've come to realize, this model is faulty. I constantly have dropped calls. And the phone gets really hot after just 10 minutes of talking. If you want a reliable phone-- which everyone does, do not get this phone."
3,Look to pre-paid,"I was a ATT subscriber for years and the quality was great. However, in a belt tightening move I opted for Skype for a landline at $60/year UNLIMITED (I pay $50/month for broadband anyway) then I noticed that our two cell phones cost $81/month regardless of usage so I looked around and found TMobile prepaid and got cell phones with 2200 minutes for one year at $230. Since CA is now going to ticket drivers using phones it is a good excuse to just call when I get HOME!"
1,Horrible Fone,"I had this fone for over 2 weeks now. I gota say this fone is nothing but a piece of useless device. I had so many drop-call (very frustrating), signal strength is always 2 bars top. It is hard to travel with this fone, because signal is very weak when you are out of town. One more thing I hate about this fone is the keyboard, you have to use your nails and push real hard to get to where you want to. Enough said, I guess I do not have anything nice to tell you about this fone. Bottom line is ""do not get it"""
4,"Three down, bunch to go","Pretty good stuff. I had read the first two books in this series and couldn't find the third anywhere in bookstores, so I ordered it, and I'm glad I did. Intriguing story line, interesting characters. The only complaint is that I feel it was fairly anti-climactic. Could've used another hundred pages."
1,VERY Disappointed with order,"I ordered a watch from Chelsea Watches that had a stainess steel band and they sent me a the watch I ordered but it had a leather band. I don't like the bait and switch tactics that some retailers use, it ends up costing the consumer time, money and frustration."
4,Carpe Diem,"Hello,As the other Rough Trade-albums, Weapens is terrific, even more sensual. I am a great fan from this Canadian Band since the first hour, but here in Belgium it was and is very difficult to find their records.Now I have all the records, even the compilation ""Birds on a feather"".It's a big lost for the music-history they disbanded shortly afterwards.Kind regards.Hendrik."
4,New valve oil,"I can't really find this stuff locally any more. Shipment was prompt, and product was new and unopened. It worked well."
4,ax5212,I just got this cd player and so far it is great. The packaging was kind of hard to open but the cd player works great. Its nice and loud and you can add extra bass.
1,horrible design,"I bought this cd player at Target & returned it the same day. First off, as other reviewers commented, the packaging is a real pain to open. But my big complaint is this cd player is supposed to take either 2 AAA batteries, or 2 AA batteries. When you try to insert 2 AA batteries you cannot put the lid back on the battery compartment. I tried everything (& yes, I did read the instructions). I have no idea how this thing sounds or whether or not it skips. I returned it once I discovered the problem with the battery compartment."
3,O.K. book!!,"A typical story of an African American family who are trying to live their dreams. Until Mel loses her job and discovers the dire financial condition she and her husband, Builder, are in. This book clearly shows that finances can strain a marriage. However, with faith, love, trust, and teamwork all things are overcome. I would not recommend this book to anyone that is going through a financial situation. I think it would be too depressing. However, it was O.K. reading. Good try Ms. Smith. Keep them coming!!!"
4,Faye!! You Go Girl!!,"This book was an excellent example of how the so called African American elite society can get so caught up in their own world. So, when life throws you a curve we don't know how to handle it. Unfortunately we have to be humbled. And this book depicts the fall and then putting the pieces back together, only to rise again.Erica Raphael"
1,Not what I was expecting,"I read the first story, Video from this collection, and I couldn't stomach it. The characters and situations were extremely implausible in my opinion. I think that there's enough material in the Indian, and Indian diaspora experience without going into the realm of fantasy. I prefer short stories that provoke me by making me look at reality or ""normal"" from a different perspective. Frankly, this first story is like an unimaginative teenagers wet dream... as for the rest of the book, I didn't bother reading it. With soo many other outstanding works of Indian literature to choose from, this just isn't worth the time."
3,Nosebleeds / Multivitamin cause or just coincidence,I first bought this at Vitamin Shoppe.i don't know about anyone else but I started taking this product and have gotten nosebleeds. At first I thought nothing of it. I have slightly high blood pressure and take hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. I can take my BP meds w/o issue. I can take the vitamin it seems without issue but the trio together seems to be the culprit.I'm not sure it's a correlation but I had never taken this particular vitamin (I wanted a more 'natural' alternative) and virtually never get nosebleeds. I have had maybe 7+ since... (in ~2 weeks)The vitamin itself seems ok but if I get nosebleeds it really doesn't help me.
5,Angel Watch,It is comforting to read about other people having angelic moments. Thank goodness there is someone out there with Catherine's gift for reporting such encounters with accuracy and interest. Keep up the good work!
2,Misled,"Although other reviews were favorable for this book, maybe it's just not what I was looking for. On a spiritual journey, I'm looking for credible existence of some type of ""afterlife."" I was hoping to read about varying individuals' experiences, near-death or otherwise, but it seems the author just has some kind of freakishly remarkable family who all have tons of their own experiences with the great beyond. Interesting? Yes. Credible? No."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND A WASTE OF MONEY,"IF YOU KNOW HOW TO <HTML>, THEN YOU'LL FIND THIS BOOK A WASTE OF TIME. IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO <HTML>, YOU WON'T LEARN ANYTHING FROM THIS BOOK ANYWAY."
4,Whte Man's Blues,"Best white harmonica player and very influential. His first two albums were monumental in crossing the color barriers in blues and starting indian influenced music i.e ""East West"". These 3rd and 4th L.P.'S still have some of the original members ie. Elvin Bishop. Played on the FM stations in it's day. Great rendition of Marvin's ""One More Heartache"". Please don't say Marvin Who? Died way too young! Great talent!"
5,One of the best superhero games ever!,"I had wanted to play Atari's Superman: Shadow of Apokolips since I learned it would be soon released, and on a whim I purchased it... and I must say that I was highly impressed! It actually feels like I am in an episode of the Superman cartoon. It's quite brilliant! The only draw backs to the whole Superman experience is that some of the villians are some of the more obscure, save Lex Luthor, his bodyguard Mercy Graves and Darkseid, and sometimes there is difficulty using the flying controls. They take quite some time to get used to. But overall, Superman: Shadow of Apokolips is a fantastic adventure well worth the [money] spent to purchase it."
1,lyiers,this seller got my payment an never sent the game I contacted them several times but no response so I advise this sender to send my game or refund me back. it's been 2 years now
5,Very good and fun to play,"with the cheats of 'jor el' and 'smallville' for infinite strenght and powers it became more realistic. If you could have 2 player battles, could unlock different superman suits over the years, unlock combos (spiderman movie game), watch superman episodes, have more artwork from over the years, be able to move even faster, like a special move whcih enables 'light speed' flight and movement, be able to run like the 'flash', have more amazing special moves like ultimate twister or somethin..... if you could have all the unlock features .ie. suits, episodes, 2 player, more moves it would be the best game on the plannet...... i really enjoyed completeing it twice and level warping/level attack to fight metallo about 10 times :-)"
4,In between,"This game is very good, but it is not as good as good as other super hero games such as Batman Vengeance, or Spider-man The Movie.However it is better than Batman Vengance, because i'ts cell shaded graphics are better than that of Batman. It is not better than Spider-man lenght or fight wise. Over all I would rate this a very good game."
3,Cool Game,This game was bought as a birthday present for my younger brother. He really enjoyed the game and is a big Superman fan. He had fun playing the game.
1,Better off with your old stuff,"I recently purchased the Konyin wireless key board. What a mistake, the name Konyin should have tipped me off. My system had to be restarted over and over again. The courser would constantly freeze. I could not get it to work unless I restarted. After several hours of trying, I finally gave up. Thank God that Amazon has a no hassle return policy. I boxed it up and sent it back. There was no way I wanted a replacement. I received my refund promptly."
5,Hawaiian Heaven,"My wife and I were married on the Hawaiian island of Kauai in 1997 and it really was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Whilst waiting for our return flight I was browsing the music stand in Honolulu airport and came across this CD. I bought it but had to wait until we returned home before I could play it. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from something picked up from a music stand in the airport but this blew us both away. This was EXACTLY what we wanted. It was the true blend of gentle Hawaiian music that is popular on Kauai. This is a fantastic CD to relax to and it always brings the memories flooding back for us both. You don't have to of visited the Hawaiian islands to appreciate this though. I really can't recommend this CD highly enough - its just a shame that Amazon dont have any track snippets available for this cd <hint, hint>."
2,These lunchboxes LEAK!,I guess I shouldn't have presumed they wouldn't leak. Mostly I like to bring salads to work and these don't stay closed.
3,almost perfect,this DVD came in great condition the case looks new and there were no visable marks on the DvD. however it was frustrating that three scenes till the end the movie skipped and refused to play out the end of the movie. i only payed less than five dollars so i guess i got what i paid for. the movie was fine until the very end.
5,*ThE* BeSt ViDeO i'Ve eVeR SeeN..,"I cant even begin to say how that video effected me. I knew that it would be good because Usher was in it, but I had no idea. I was completely blown away. This movie made me laugh, cry, and just feel exactly how they felt. I could relate to this movie like it was really happening to me. I encourage EVERYONE to rent this."
4,A good movie with a good message,"Inner city schools usually aren't the nicest places in the world. But the condition here is terrible. The windows are broken, only half the students have books, and the teachers literary don't give a damn about the kids. The conditions are so terrible that when the only decent teacher gets fired and a student is attacked by a school cop it pushes six students over the edge. They take an ingured cop hostage and demand things that should be standared in schools, like books and windows. The problem is the people in the city aren't to keen on giving them what they want.In my opinion this movie was great and it really opened up peoples eyes to poor conditions in schools and other serious issues like child abuse drugs and teen pregnency. I loved it myself. My only complaint is with the cussing. I realize that people swear a lot but I was watchign this thing with my parents!"
3,Interesting but not good,"This movie was o.k. But it got really boring. I was like, when will it end? The end was really deep and sad. It wouldn't see it twice. The acting wasn't good. I got tired of looking at the school. I wished they would go outside! Not a video to own. A one time thing."
4,An awsome CD player,Just got it today this thing is awsome its really thin and lightweight the sound quality is exelent and the headphones it comes with are great they are the kind that go behind your head.I really like the design the buttons are in all the right places.Im only dissapointed about the durability the cover is a little loose and I dont think it has the repeat option and thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.I also like how it looks and its some of it is red so thats pretty cool.
2,Think Twice Before You Buy,"The first part sounds alright except the hissing sound is rather distracting. Note that the piano was a Baldwin and the picture is rather blurred: it is somewhat like watching TV with your reading glass or even worse. So, sound and picture-wise, it is categorically below the general standard. But there is some music after all as the piano playing is great. For the Rachmaninov, it sounds more like an old piano in disrepair which is badly out of tune: quite annoying or even unbearable to say the least."
5,Brilliant,"Very convenient, small, light, strapless design clips to your ball cap brim. The ample red light preserves night vision. It's inexpensive, well made and even comes with a couple of batteries."
1,Don't waste your money,"I read the earlier reviews and thought, ""for that little amount, I should go ahead a buy a couple."" I'm sorry I did. I opened the package and the battery cover doesn't ""click"". So I got it to work by having to tape it together-- right out of the box. Unbelievable.I'm not going to bother calling or sending it back-- it's just not worth it-- instead, I'm going to look for something that's better made. But this thing is junk."
3,Batteries fell out--difficult to recenter adequately,I love the light especially while climbing for bow hunting. I dropped the light and the back came off and the batteries were dislodged. I have tried multiple positions to replace them without results. I contacted the customer service email that assured me I would have an answer within 24 hours. No correspondence so far. Maybe I am missing something very simple but would love to hear from Cyclops.
1,Garbage,"I bought this for night fishing and wasn't expecting much for a few bucks but it didn't even make 2 uses. After the first time I used it 1 of the lights burned out. Took it out of the tackle box last night and 2 lights were out. More ""Made in China"" landfill material."
3,This Keeper was a no keeper for me.,"Item seemed to be very well made. While reading the packaging, I discovered that this item is not designed to be used on vehicles with over the rail bedliners. Nothing I read, previous to ordering, alerted me to this problem. Consequently, I had to return the 3 packages I had received."
2,Looks Good...works less than good,two worked fine...easy to pull up and push down...two did not...I had to pry them up every time I wanted to use them.
4,Special Days written in Special Ways,"This book has been very helpful to me. I'm always chosen to do something with a church program. This book has helped me with greeting, prayers, and occasions for every type of church program. This is a very resourceful book to have especially if you are involved in church programs as I am. I recommend this book, but in the future write things more general. I use this book a lot."
4,Back to Planet Oldfield...,"Alright. I know there have been many people who don't quite know what to make of this album. But as a lifelong fan, and one who was hellishly disappointed in the over-commercialized hype and hoopla surrounding the much vaunted Millennium set (where the hell were the bloody guitars!?), I was relieved and gratified to see old Mike finally getting back into the studio and flying off into his own world. Which is where I feel most of his best music comes from. Especially when it sounds as if he was having a great deal of fun creating it. And thank you God, the electric guitar returns with a vengeance. So, it's a chill out album. So effing what? I myself would be a touch worried about the man if he brought us Amarok every single year. Good, no, great return to form. Atmospherics, brilliant tunes, marvelous production, and hardly an irritating rap or turntable scratch break in evidence...welcome back Mike, me old mucker, it's good to have you among the living once again."
5,It's pretty wonderful,"This, along with the PC game, is a definite masterpiece. All the sounds are soothing and atmospheric, taking you to distant, calm places. The PC game IS that world, enabling you to discover dozens of wondeful places; crystal caverns, deep seas...All in all I recommend this to anybody who realizes that synthesizers don't make music bad, but instead enhance it."
2,big step down from his previous works,"this is synthetic and boring instrumental music with horrible Saxophone (as somebody mentioned too before) and lakc of good ideas.the only songs that are reminding of what Oldfield did the best few years ago are ""return to Origin"" and title track which have charming guitar riffs and are relaxing.the rest (and the PC game as well) are only an unoriginal and repeating new-age stuff that everyone could do on their own Computer.this is not what should be expected from Mike Oldfield2 stars for ""return to origin"" (really good song)"
2,Tired of music.,"Me, being a die-hard fan of Mike's music, I must admit that this one does not measure up. Ever since Mike brought us TBIII his path in music has been downhill. Millennium Bell was terrible, so was Guitars and now this. Perhaps not terrible in the way that he's fresh out of ideas. Perhaps more terrible because some lack of interest seems to be going on. Mike is not a medicore musician by nature, infact it's the other way arround. Therefore it's almost heartbreaking to realize that he chooses to do the things this way. Perhaps he's grown tired of music, but if that's the case, he should refrain and spare us the humility. But perhaps he's overdue."
2,"Ok, two and a half","If, like me, you've been a fan of Mike Oldfield's music and still think of Ommadawn or Incantations as masterpieces, you'll probably be disappointed by Tres Lunas. Some tracks may sound good, bu others just don't resonate, and anyway most of them are far too long. Before writing this review, I tried to listen to the record at least 4 or 5 times and in the end I didn't even find it really PLEASANT. The more you listen to it, the more boring it tends to get - it doesn't really grow up on you. As to the saxophone he uses, it doesn't fit with the music. That was a very bad idea I think.Had the record come from someone else, I would have called it a deserving effort - not so great but still promising.Yet, it is Mike Oldfield and as he is such an old hand in the business, he should know better than that. Tres Lunas just doesn't stand up to his usual high standards.I'm starting to think he might be dead as a music composer, but doesn't seem to know it yet."
4,Pretty average for Mike - which still rates 4 stars...,"Mike doesn't appear to be breaking any new ground here (which, after all the new ground he's broken in the past, is ok with me). The CD moves along nicely, with no real outstanding tracks to catch your attention. I would compare this outing to be better than ""Guitars"", but not as good as ""Millennium Bell"". The only disappointment I have is that it took Mike 3 years to come out with a disc that, while pleasant to listen to, is really nothing special (at least for Mike's high standards of music).One last item; this CD has a highly polished piece of engineering behind it. As usual for Mr. Oldfield, the music tracks are so professional laid down, that it's amazing more people don't seek Mike out just for his skills in the booth."
3,Mike is getting old?,"Beeing a big Mike fan, I must say that he continues disappointing me. This CD isn't bad, but not really good either. Mike seem to progress from an innovative pioneer to a main-stream dance music maker. Fortunately, this CD is not at all as bad as the disaster 'Millenium Bell'. Thanks for that, Mike."
2,Certainly not lyrical,"Although I found the story somewhat engaging, Mr. Danner's prose was disjointed and his images unnecessarily coarse. His frequent genital and bowel references were decidedly offputting. I found the language offensive and am confused that it would be described as lyrical. This detracted from any sympathy or empathy I might have had for any of the characters. It was difficult to believe that Mary would be so physically unprepared for her trip. Described as a millionaire twice over, she seems to have brought nothing with her for herself or her patients. This is only one of the many flaws that ran throughout the story. I am giving it two stars only because I finished it."
3,See the world,See the world (or at least India) thru Danner's eyes. Makes you feel like you're in the Himalayas. I want the good doctor to leave her misery behind and go back to the comfort (?) of America but she stays and endures. (And finds contentment)
4,A Real Trip!,"A good read -- different from anything I have read before. Danner creates a unique setting with lively descriptions and an interesting global jumble of characters whose viewpoints alternate throughout the story. The bleak realities of surgical trauma and austere landscape are the strengths of the book, in addition to some well-drawn personalities. Its weakenesses are the occasionally sloppy prose that fails to match the appropriate speaking ""voice"" of an individual character, and what to me was a rather jerky, foreshortened ending that did not do justice to the elegantly bizarre plot and characters. I did find it a fascinating journey of sorts and will add it to the list of independent reading books for my high school World Lit students."
3,Himalayan Discovery,"Through themes of self-knowledge, redemption, isolation, and healing, Craig Danner successfully interweaves the lives of a disparate cast of characters in his Himalayan setting. The story unfolds through multiple persepectives, which I enjoyed even though each voice was not completely distinct. For much of the novel I was more interested in the fate of Doctor Mary and Amond than the other characaters. Near the end of the novel, however, the voices of the other charcters become stronger as the significance of the Hindu culture becomes more prominent. The miscommunications that occur throughout the novel--largely due to a series of unchecked assumptions on the part of many characaters--drive the plot and shape the outcome of the characters' contact with one another. The similarities between the female chararcters become clear at the end as each finds strength within herself and experiences redemption, creating an ending that seems both satifying and realistic."
3,Himalayan Dhaba--traveling medicine,"Lyrical story of a widowed doctor who travels to the far corner of the world seeking to heal and be healed. Unusual characters and setting. The book can be hard to follow at times--the voices of the main characters blur along with their experiences, and the narrative feels more like a set of short stories than one continuous arc. But there are honest --shocking-- images of the physicality and emotion of human experience."
4,Riveting Stories Within the Story,"This book was suggested to me by a good friend as a worthwhile and enjoyable read. I certainly found the book to be captivating in its details of a wide variety of people, places and events. Danner writes each chapter to stand alone in the telling of his larger story. His descriptions of personal hardships and emotions, in a harsh and backwards land, makes you feel and experience with the characters. The book is different, but very satisfying, and brings all the personal stories together into a ""smile-pleasing"" conclusion."
1,Himalayan Dhaba,"Did not enjoy the writing style, and found the story very contrived. Was not a favorite with the book club."
4,Great Book,I loved this book. I felt like I was in India working in that hospital. I usually don't like medical themes to books but this one had me hooked!
5,Excellent dealer,"The book was as described -- in fact, the description was conservative -- it was in wonderful shape. Quick and very courteous serevice."
3,Not Rich Yet,"I know there's treasure in California, the problem is where? The bad news is even when this book suggests locations, its not accessible. Public land (park lands, forests) use prohibits treasure hunting in all but the most desolate areas (BLM designated areas). Private property searches require the owners consent. Put away your metal detector and enjoy the stories of lost treasure, good hunting if you dare to look."
3,Misleading Advertising,"The program, for what it actually is designed to do is easy to use and fun as a toy. I may look into getting a microphone for my kids to play around with, as I am now stuck with the software.The advertisement, however, stated users could edit their ""own unique songs"". I took this to mean I could use music I already owned on CD's, which is what I needed. This program will not allow the user to import anything. The ""songs"" created with this program are mostly percussion."
4,Haco can make you an addict,"This music is addictive to those with ears for melodic yet experimental and uniquely textured pop songs. I have other Haco cds that go into even deeper experimental or avant garde territory but, as another reviewer pointed out, this is sort of comfortable without being mainstream. I really like this girl's music. I guess that if you like Amy Denio, Robert Wyatt, Charles Hayward, Iva Bittova and the likes you'll feel right at home. Just keep in mind there are more daring works from this artist out there."
3,"It's okay, not good, not bad","I thought this movie was okay. It's background was excellent, but the characters could have had more work on. Their heads looks strangely too big for their bodies. The story was sort of cliche ish. (Boy beats up big bad monster.) the story also seemed rushed, one second the story drags, then the next the movie throws something new, then heads back for dragging again. It doesn't flow, (like Princess Mononoke, Titan A.E. those are excellent animated films) This movie also seems to ""copy"" from the movie ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" which is better. Overall it's an okay movie,But i think it's only worth watching 1 time."
2,The B/W Scenes Look Awful,"Remastered and restored, really? From bad VHS copies, I'm guessing. While the color portion of the movie looks okay, the black and white portion at the beginning is downright awful. Whoever ""restored"" this film ought to be fired if they haven't been already. We have waited years for this to be realeased on DVD and they offer us this low-quality garbage. The studio should be ashamed."
5,"""The Blue Bird means Hapiness""says Berri Lou","This is my favorite Shirley Temple movie and I being a lover of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" I fell in love with ""The Blue Bird"" also. I love stories that have fantasy plots and adventures of young children seeking love and/or happiness. The characters in the story are very creative and loveable-except for the mean Tylette and the greedy Luxuries. The setting is beautiful for being an early 1940's picture. I'm a big fan of Shirley Temple and love anything she does, but this is my favorite all time movie of hers. If you have children or are a child of the heart, rent or buy the movie from the trustworthy Amazon.com. If you miss out on this movie, you are missing out on a classic picture."
4,good experience,"As usual when I order anything from Amazon I know it as well as my payment is going to be secure and I am going to get a good product. Of course, The Bluebird came to me in very good condition and I am sure it will give me many years of happiness and good service. Thanks Amazon, you are the best"
4,wonderful movie,"I have enjoyed this movie for many years. Yes Shirley plays a spoiled kid, and she doesn't sing or dance, but that does not take away from the beauty of the story. I would highly recommend this movie for kids and adults alike, of course adults with a child like heart will enjoy more. War breaks out daddy is draftedthe children are sent to find the blue bird of happiness. The children are sent by a fairy and MAny things take on human form to give their side of things. The loyal dog the sly and selfish cat. (Not a movie if your a cat lover) Light takes on human form and guides them, trees take on human form. It is a delightful show."
5,Beautiful. One Of Cinema's Most Elegant Fantasies,"this is a beautiful film fantasy. probably one of the most beautiful ever filmed. it's also still under-appreciated to an extent. it doesn't have the same broad entertainment appeal that say 'OZ' does, but it's a much more attractive film. it's lush set design and photography are mostly due to it's director Walter Lang who was known for this kind of look.it also features Shirley Temple in probably one of her most sophisticated roles as a child. her MyTyl charachter is a anti-hero (or heroine) of sorts. she doesn't start out as good or likeable. very different from the roles offered her at the time.children's cinema hardly ever looks this good or is this noteworthy. definitely a must for any child's classics collection."
3,Not Shirley at her best,"While others think that the fault of this movie is that Shirley plays a mean girl rather than her usual sweet fare, I did not find that disturbing. I did, however, think the acting, including Shirley's, wasn't as good as her other pictures. I also found the odd names of everyone distracting from the point of the story which is the search for the true source of happiness. It was interesting to watch once, but I won't go back to it in the same way I do her other pictures."
2,"Fox's answer to MGM's ""Wizard"" falls short","20th Century-Fox rushed this fairy tale to the screen following the success of MGM's ""Wizard of Oz"". Shirley Temple was turned down for Dorothy and Fox wanted to cash in on the reinvigorated fantasy genre. However, Fox had neither the time, talent and resources to rival MGM's classic.Temple's character is too unlikeable for any connection with the audience, and the fairy tale atmosphere is too heavy handed. Even the switch from Black and White to color is abrupt and without the nuance of the transition in ""Wizard"".One note: with all the talk of Christmas in the film, why is there a menorah in the children's bedroom?Beautiful color and costumes cannot save this ""turkey"" (oops, I meant to say ""bird"")"
2,Bluebird Lays an Egg,"Ok I am like very disapointed with this film Shirley didn't get the role of Dorthy in The Wizard of OZ And so made this similar fantasy,based on a famous children's play. Shirley enters the land of death to seek the blue bird of happiness.It was her last child role she was 12 at the time. I feel very bad because she was the greatest actress and she was still adorable at the age of12 .I don't really understand why people say she was stiff exactly. She dances to Laydeo with her grandfather while she visits them.Don't get me wrong though, I thought the movie was quite good until the color part the rest was junk. It was quite cheesey with the fire and I don't understand the point of it. I though of it as a let-down for everyone. After her first flop her acting career as a child was over quite a sad story indeed"
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this video for my 7-year-old son, and we were both very disappointed in the movie. This is not a movie that you would want to own..... I would recommend renting it instead (if you must). The setting is dark, and depressing, the story-line appears to have been thrown together haphazardly, and the costumes for the fantasy characters are cheap (I've seen better costumes in a local school play). The only reason that this movie is in the ""classics"" section, is because it stars Shirley Temple."
5,Organic Gardening: Plain and Simple,"Plain and simple is just the way I like this book. It is written in a way that the reader can appreciate because it reiterates facts in past chapters that the reader may have forgotten (that is, if the reader reads it in order from the first to last page). Even if not read in order, it's perfect for opening up to whatever section is necessary for the reader. I have not read all the way through this book yet, but I plan on starting an organic garden come spring. I can't wait to turn to the pages with the hands-on practices necessary to maintain an organic garden."
5,Good Reference to have on hand.,"I was looking for a something to help answer those basic, burning questions about organic gardening. This book does that. Its great to have on hand to refer to from time to time."
5,Extremely Pleased!!,This book is great for the organic gardener. We've enjoyed all of the information in this book. We highly recommend it onto others. :)
5,Easy read for a beginner,"For someone who is just starting out with organic gardening, this is a great book. I've done a little gardening here and there but never to the extent I am now planning. This book has tons of helpful hints and tips. I'm looking forward to getting started this year and finally feel that I have the tools and knowledge to do it."
3,1/2 a Gilbert,"I gave this album 3 stars only because the first 5 or 6 tracks merited it.The remaining songs unfortunately are almost like space fillers. They could be just anyone's compositions.Had GOS remained in his cooperation with Gordon Mills, would things have been different?It is also an amazing fact that while all the oldies stations constantly play the same 30 or 50 songs on and on and on each day, they can not find one GOS song to reminisce the early seventies...!"
2,"Excellent Playing, But Woefully Flawed Recording","Heiller is a fine organist, and his interpretations of these Bach standards are well-done. The dire shame of this project is that the recording itself is full of drop-outs, momentary loss of channels, hiss, and wow/flutter. These scars aren't present on all tracks, but are on many of them (including the momumental Passacaglia -- particularly at the trimphant climax!). I don't know if these recording problems were on the original 1964 LP release or occurred in the CD mastering process, but, in all my decades of listening to all types of music, I have NEVER heard a commercially-released recording with such fundamental technical errors. Someone -- either in 1964 or 1996 -- was asleep in the engineering booth!"
1,Wrong product description,"I bought this product, because it said in the description ""multiplatform use with any tomtom gps"" but in fact it's not working for tomtom navigator. Furthermore, the announced medium was DVD and what arrived was in fact an SD card with the data. So not usable for me and I returned it."
1,"THIS LOOKED LIKE A GOOD CD, BUT.....",BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS CD I KNEW OF BUDDY MORROW BECAUSE OF HIS WORK WITH THE TOMMY DORSEY ORCHESTRA. HE HAS BEEN THE LEADER OF THIS WONDERFUL ORCHESTRA. ON THIS PARTICULAR CD HE IS ON HIS ON. ON FIRST GLANCE OF THE SONGS LISTED I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE A FAIRLY GOOD CD BUT THE PROBLEM IS OF THE 16 SONGS LISTED ONLY 8 ARE HOUSEHOLD NAMES AND OF THE RAMINING 8 SONGS I ONLY LIKED 4 SONGS. HIS ARRANGEMENTS WERE NOT VERY GOOD.I BELEIVE THIS WAS A WASTED EFFORT ON BUDDY'S PART.
2,Grainy video. Terrible software.,We got this camera on sale . . . now I know why. The software is slowly ruining our Gateway. It removed a decoder feature we had connected to one program and now we can't get it back w/o calling a hardware specialist.The video is grainy. Shooting in doors is terrible. We have an old camera that works better than this.
3,Great...If you film using flood lamps.,"I like the quality of the camera in ample light. The problem I have is low light video. You can't see anything, and the low light settings make everyone look like they're moving through a strobe light. There is a review below that tells you how to fix it, but it doesn't help the darkness of the picture. It might as well be a $400 tape recorder."
1,JVC GZ-MG21u,I was very disapointed with the Quality and performance of this recorder. Low light settings render poor picture quality. Standard battery life one hour! Even at the highest picture quality it does less than expected for the price. Please don't waste your time and money on this model.
2,Dont buy this,We have had this unit for a year now and are pretty disappointed for the money we paid. We upgraded to this JVC hd model from a Panasonic minidv that was great. First indoors the camcorders light is nearly useless at more than three feet. The video picture qualty is terrible unless you turn the frame rate down. I think basicaly this is a good unit for the bright outdoors. The camera is well thought out functionally has great controlls. The software that came with it is somewhat usefull but not good or up to par for the cost. I sold our 5 year old panasonic for a 100 bucs and I really miss it.
4,Good deal for money,"This camera does what I want; allows me to take quality footage of my daughter as she continues to grow. I don't record film footage in a cave, so I have no complaints about the low light conditions. If what you're looking to do is capture precious moments as keepsakes, then this ought to meet the need.Pros:*Hard drive storage, so no disks to tote*Small bodied, light weight*Easy connection to TV or other media for playback*Controls are fairly easy to navigateCons:*Battery life is short; buy a spare or two, as well as a separate charger (shop online for bargains)"
3,Something to remember,"I got this camera about a year ago mainly to film myself throwing discus.. anyways it had worked really well for doing that (discus), but when i used to make a film for a class at school, it was on a rolling tripod and i was rolling it down the hall filming and the tripod got kicked, and now i have to replace the hard drive. Not that JVC should replace it, but it is a point to think of when getting this camera. You would never have that problem with DV or SD. Otherwise it is a great camera for non professional video like families or students."
2,Not very good,"I actually read all of the reviews posted here about this camera before I bought it. I noticed that there were some serious issues right out of the box with the ""Low Light"" quality. Then I noticed that the ""Fix"" offered by one of my fellow reviewers didn't do anything... in fact made it so that I can't see ANYTHING at all because it's so dark. (The ""Gain Up"" being turned off made it so that I couldn't see across a small room with all the lights on.) THEN I noticed that, when I put the video right on to my computer from the camera, even though I had it set to the highest quality setting, the quality of the image was still significantly below what I expected.Bottom line is that I am returning it tomorrow, and going back to MiniDV."
2,Consider Something Else,"I purchased this a few months ago, and am not very happy with it. Operationally and functionally it works fine. However, I'm not at all happy with the quality of the videos/pictures. I had a small digital I bought for $125 and the video quality is the same. Also, even after making the adjustments and settings recommended for low-light and indoor photography, it is not very good. And then, you have to reset for outdoors, then reset for indoors, etc. If it involved one or two adjustments, it would be fine but it's a lot of hassle for poor quality you end up with. Also, this just may be me, but it's so light when you use zoom it's very hard to hold it steady and the image then gets blurred like it's out of focus. For a $500 range camera, I would look at something else."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"The overall look of the film is dull enough to turn off those who are looking for a good documentary. The narration is dull and Monty and the narrator keep stating things like ('This wasn't staged' and 'this horse really did get tame'). Much of the narration consists of Monty and the main narrator insisting that the methods works, it wasn't staged, etc, etc...almost as if they had some insecurities about the methods themselves! The transition from scene to scene is choppy and the cinematography is lame. Some of the lines during the whole release thing with Shy Boy seemed rehearsed, such as Tara's emotionless insistence that Shy Boy will come back...a very dull film. You'll regret it. The only interesting segment was the curing of the racehorse, Blushing ET"
1,expensive and worthless,This is probably the worst electronic dictionary i ever bought. I bought this dictionary 5 months ago and i thought its a great dictionary since they said its contains over 1 millions of words. Its true it contains over a million of word but the translation was so poor and confusing from english to vietnamese a lot of time i just tossed it away. Plus the battery only held 5 minutes so i had to charge it everytime i wanted to use it. I wish i didn't wasted $500 for it and only used 20 days.
5,Wish I still had mine,"It seems sad that I would pine over a 2 speaker DVD/CD system but truth be told the Panasonic SC-DP1 did it all right in one small little package that only cost me $200 bucks back in the day.I loved that little thing. It had decent sound and it played DVD's and music and it had a radio. I was so happy with it, but then I had to give it up to my ex, it was either that or I lose my Bose 3-2-1 and that wasn't going to happen.If you can ever find one of these, buy it. It's a steal if its under $200. You will be pleased. More so because it has Component connections and because you can hook an active subwooder up to this baby and you have an instant pseudo-surround sound home theater system with an easy to use remote and great crisp sound for small rooms.One day, I will be re-united with another Panasonic SC-DP1. I hope one day soon as I am missing it dearly."
4,Much closer to pink than purple.,Decent head wrap. Just wish the color was as dark as the picture. It'll make a nice gift to a woman I know at work that rides a Harley.
4,very accurate info abt the partition of indo-pak,"this book is amazing since it gives a very account of how the indo pak reigon was to be divided. i have been searching this copy for a long time, i hope i have it in my hands soon."
5,One of my all time favorites,"This is a beautifully written story, including timeless black and white photographs, about a 6 year old boy's first experience as a sternman on a lobster boat. It is a classic rite of passage story. My 5 year old son loves it. We have read it countless times. I highly recommend it."
3,OK if you're looking for a lift - however not a 'how to' book.,"Not a bad read. Full of anecdotes, quotes and the like of how patience has benefited peoples lives - or where its absence, has not. I was a little disappointed however by the lack of the subject matter which I bought the book for, which was - how to develop ones patience. If you are like me and are aiming higher than just a warm fuzzy feeling and want practical advice on what it takes to develop this competency, then look elsewhere.An addendum; If your looking for practical, workable advice see - ""Patience Pays Off"" by James Sherman PhD or ""The practicing mind"" by Thomas Sterner."
5,The Power of Patience: How to Slow the Rush and Enjoy More H,"Mary Jane Ryan's POWER OF PATIENCE puts it all into perspective. Through inspiring quotes, stories, and practical suggestions, she creates an insightful, personal and very useful journey for readers. I've had the book a week and have already read it twice (the combination of a house fire, huge loss and a very bad insurance company are making me a student of patience and perspective...thank goodness for this book!). POWER OF PATIENCE would also make a terrific gift."
2,"Great photographers,photographs - VERY POOR reproductions!","I used to enjoy everything from NG - magazine (still very good) books etc., however this book continues to show the NGS as it slides downhill. The photographic reproduction is marginal at best (as in so many of their latest offerings) where great, often heroic photos are shown soft or seemingly out of focus. The paper stock is awful. This could have been a wonderful book, and it winds up as almost an insult to past and present Geographic photographers. I'd gladly pay ten dollars more if they could work to improve it. I suppose that's what happens when a non-profit organization moves to a for-profit one!"
1,Piece of JUNK!,This device is flimsy and cheap. It broke within 1 hour of use. The sound is average at best. The error I got on this CD Player wasn't even listed in the troubleshooting guide.STAY AWAY FROM PHILIPS MERCHANDISE.
2,Is it Plastic?,The belt does not have the rich color as shown in the picture. The glossy finish makes it look like it is made of plastic. Very dissapointed.
3,Research Needed on Cover Material,"While this is not one of the best of Temple's efforts, the film held your interest and had excellent acting by Frank Morgan and Helen Westley. However, the material on the dvd cover indicated ""See the Famous Staircase Dance with Bill Robinson"". Unfortunately, that is not in this film. Bill Robinson is not in this film, although he directed some of the dance sequences. I think the people producing these products need to check their research BEFORE they develop the cover materials. While I knew Bojangles was not in this film, there could be others misled by this material."
3,"Dimples,a lovely and charming film","Hello,I'm from Germany and an absolute Shirley Temple-worshipper. This movie is vintage -shirley, although I have to admit more on the sentimental side. If you love a good cry and lots of musicalnumbers,you will take this one."
2,a real downer,"Frank Morgan plays Shirley's thieving old grandfather who would cheat his own mother. Every time he is trusted, he betrays that trust and steals again."
2,I don't like this movie,"I love little Shirley Temple singing and acting, but this movie is not the best. If you like Shirley and a collector of her movies than go for it."
1,-----------------------------many stars,"I gotta say, I really dispise Shirley temple. Any movie that Shirley Temple is in is either a joke or annoying as hell. Shirley Temple bites!"
1,Beware of Black Forest Books,"I ordered what was listed as a new book "" Ireland a Terrible Beauty"", a book I had years ago and loved but wanted a new one for a gift. The book had a small stain on the edge of the pages which raised my suspicions, no cover jacket[?new?] and just recently opened by the recipient discovered part of a page had been cut out and another page revealed red underlined words. Before gifting I contacted the Black Forest through Amazon and requested a refund upon return of the book. They refused. I would not order from this company. I paid $119.00 for this book!!"
2,Arthritis viewpoint,"I was quite disappointed in this book because I expected some illustrated exercises and some actual nutritional sample diets as it indicated on the cover.It says you ""are what you eat"" but it doesn't go much further.This is more of an analytical report but I was hoping for more."
5,Superb!,"I first heard of this band on a DTR/Rushmore sampler in January of 2005. They have been one of my favorite bands ever since. Even though this EP is the only material they have it is FANTASTIC! It shows so much potential, just thinking about the music they're going to make gets me giddy.I like pop punk a lot and i listen to a lot of bands that sounds exactly the same, but Self Against City is special. I can't really describe it because it's something that I feel inside but i don't think many can deny the special talent, chemistry, and potential these guys possess.It's only six songs but it's one of my favorite albums ever. Their full length finally comes out this fall and i absolutely cannot wait. I believe in them so much! i would encourage anyone and everyone i know to buy this album; including you! :)"
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"it's hard to compete with reviews where the person writing it is from the hometown of the band but being from pittsburgh, pennsylvania i can only imagine being from a city where this pop/punk music comes from would be outstanding, im always on the search for new artists, i was using my best tool called pandora.com and came accross self against city. when i heard their song take it how you want it, it was exactly what i want to hear everytime i look for a new band. they are kick A$$.....i recommend this EP to anyone and hope to see a debut full length album very soon!!!!"
1,"This is terrible music, if you actually like emo with some instrumental talent, avoid this!!!","I am a huge fan of emo punk, actually its my favorite kind of music, i've been listening to it for over 10 years now. Unfortunately this band is just absolute gargage. I heard this cd and couldn't listen to even one track in its entirety, they are so boring. There's no musical talent put into these songs, they just go on forever and sound the same the entire time. I know there's a lot of positive reviews on this site, but it you are like me, and i know about 80 percent of you are, you will not enjoy this cd. Try and download if first, if you like it for free then go ahead and support the band, that's what they work for. If you buy this withough hearing at least 6 songs first forever, then i think you will definitely regret your decision."
1,Long and boring.,"A very long, very boring story about a woman who lived in Victorian & Edwardian times. She could have had everything she wanted (namely, Taddeuz), if only she weren't a habitual liar.But she just could not tell the truth. She lied to Taddeuz, to her family, to the Rabbi, to Dobbe, to her lovers, her landlords, employers, even the MacKennas, who wanted nothing more than to adopt her and love her as their own.This cruel, cold-harded, manipulative, calculating woman couldn't tell anyone the truth. The sad thing was, she was convinced that constantly lying to everyone would get her permanently married to Tadduez, when all she had to do was tell the truth."
4,A saga for a remarkable woman,"A wonderful tale set in the end of 19th century of a Polish Jewish girl who discovers her talents for attracting the interest of the people and for prospering in a previously unknown world. Her thurst for knowledge and skills in the underdeveloped market of parfumes brings her from Warsaw to Australia and later to United States. Along the way he discovers love, friendship and trechery. Really, an interesting book. I enjoyed reading it!"
1,Should've listened to the other reviews.,"There's definitely a reason why there are so many 1 reviews. I took the chance hoping my experience would be different, something you can do with Amazon's great return policy, and I lost. Installed easy enough, but you key it to the lock position and it's like what almost everyone else said, it still opens, with not much more effort than you would normally use to open it. The product simply doesn't work. If you want security for your truck bed, mine is a 2004 Dodge Dakota SLT Quad Cab by the way, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. My search continues."
1,Terribad,"Firstly I have a 2009 Dodge Dakota, so maybe it's just a bad fit for that year.Since the mechanism relies on one screw for installation, if you pull the tailgate handle hard enough, it forces the lock mechanism to swivel out of the way. So when this lock is activated, a little amount of effort with one hand is enough to force the tailgate open. On top of that, the lock isn't flush with the bezel. Partly my own fault, it came with a one-way screw to attach the lock to the tailgate, so the junk won't be coming off any time soon."
3,Average CD,I thought this album was pretty good...the Harlem Globe Trotters' Theme on this is excellent
3,Dictionary of Jewish Words,I bought this to use as a Reall dictionary for Reall Hebrew words. A dictionary it is Not. It seems to be a basic information resource explaining general Jewish/ Yiddish culture. I did not find the simple words that I heard in some lovely Israeli songs. It does have information but is Not a dictionary. Very disappointing. Not at all what I was seeking.
5,Youngatheart,"This is the most thorough and definitive list of Yiddish that I have read to date including two others that Don""t measure up to this one.I guess none will ever equal what I learned from my mother."
2,where are the words?,This gets wonderful reveiws - so why are so many of the words I want to look up not in it?
3,"Good, as far as it goes...............","but very minimal. Not adequate for a serious student of the scriptures. I have tried to look up many Jewish words, both in English transliteration, and in Hebrew, and have been very disappointed.I would like to find a good Hebrew-English, English-Hebrew dictionary with transliteration. This dictionary is a good start, but that's all it is, a start."
3,Good Basic Resource,"Although this book did not contain the first two words I looked up, I still think it is a worthwhile resource especially for those not familiar with Jewish terminology. I do not regret making this purchase because it does contain some interesting information."
3,Not for Kindle,Good cheap read. I expected more from a Dictionary but fun none the less. But you should only buy the paperback version.Sucks for Kindle as there is no index. Search brings up all the words in the book. Not just the definition that you're most likely looking for.
3,Great Movie...poor shipping standards,"I ordered this movie as a last minute buy for a retreat I was working on. After reviewing all the merchants, I chose the one I did because he was located in the same state I am, and I thought the package would get here quickly. I even paid for the expedited shipping.It turns out that it actually took about the same amount of time to receive the product even if I didn't pay for the expedited shipping. For whatever reason, the package went from NC to GA in order to be shipped to my house which is in NC. For something that only would have taken maybe 2-3 days by US Mail, took 5 days by DHL....makes no sense to me!!I had to go out and buy the movie at a Best Buy since the movie did not arrive to me in enough time for the beginning of the retreat."
3,Great story and visuals-Needed Some editing,"This movie was beautifully shot, had haunting images of the slave ship and all its' horrors but the ending was overlong with false endings- needed a few cuts to make the ending as intriguing as the beginning of the story. Should be watched, none the less"
5,This is one of Spielberg's greatest films ever made,"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie will get you to the heart. It's legendary, full of life, and very well-acted. Anthony Hopkins does a great job playing John Quincy Adams."
1,Histary in a blender.,"This film takes manipulation to a new level. First of all Speilberg spends the whole first 1 1/2 hour stating and restating the self evident truth that slavery was wrong. O.K so just how guilty is the white audience supposed to feel before enough is enough? Secondly Speilberg evidently has no quams about rewriting history so long as it pushes his P.C. agenda. In reality Adams and the blacks he was defending never met, and they(blacks) never sat foot inside of a courtroom. Another of Speilbergs interesting oversights is that the lead character(i forgot his name) after being set free form the evil shackles of slavery, returned to Africa and and participated in the slave trade. If this trend continues I wonder what goofy bunk he'll try next? Maybe he can remake a ""historically accurate"" WWII movie where the Japanese won."
2,irreal and soft,"This isn't a good movie. As Spanish I don't complaint of the cruelty of other Spanish of past centuries. No doubt they were as bad as the movie presents and much more, but also they were usually much better sailors and fighters than currently is show, and masters to mock hypocrital British blockade. For the really interested I strongly recommend two master adventure novels by Pio Baroja a superb author well liked by Hemingway that almost won the Nobel prize. These are titled ""Adventures of Captain Chimista"" and ""Pilots of high Seas"" both written about 1900, and you really will know that truly Spanish fearless trafficant of slaves - between other many illegal and inmoral bussines- used to do withouth censorship. Of course as all other colonial countries. Read these and forgot this sugared comedy."
3,Pretty Good,"This is worth a viewing. I've got a friend who is a professor of history that recommended it, however, he mentioned that Spielberg conveniently cut the history short - Cinque went back to become a slave king in Africa."
5,Great movie for a bratty 13-year old...,"My son is in middle school. He is self-absorbed, narcissistic, and lackadaisical. So, I ask him to do his homework, and he replies, ""Mom! You treat me like a slave!"" There's a contest of wills. So, I change gears and I say, ""Son, how would you like to watch a movie?"" He thinks he has finally gotten his way. So I turn on *Amistad*. Three hours later, he is a kindler and gentler kid."
3,Fun Fact,"Just a little something that Spielberg either did not know, or more likely deliberately left out of the film: Cinque did indeed return to his native land...and promptly became a very wealthy slave trader.Also, Morgan Freeman's character was a complete invention."
4,powerful,"regardless of historical accuracy, the film still gives vivid insight into the life of a captured slave. i also thought the film was fairly entertaining. and as for the remarks made by Octavius, first of all, the abolitionist movement was well underway in the 1840s, the kkk was NOT formed in Connecticut, it was formed in Pulaski,Tennessee as a social club by a group of confederate army veterans. i suggest you take a U.S. history course before making such claims in the future Octavius."
3,Great story drowned in syrup,"What an opportunity for a great film: the drama, the tragedies, the historical crossroads, the meaning for US history in the state of birth...I am often opposed to remakes, but this story would deserve a competent serious new version without the cute little Hollywood cliches and without the music that envelops everything in sugar coating.I am not sure which parts of the tale are historic and which are added by the script writer or Spielberg. I find it hard to believe in John Quincy Hopkins, and if the real man did make this speech, it was a great one and would have deserved to be acted without the horrible sentimental soundtrack. The whole part is such a terrible cliche, it almost does not matter if it is historically correct. The esthetic conventions of inferior Hollywood productions should be banned from serious subjects.(Was Martin van Buren really this awful as President?)I would still say, the film is worth watching, but it is so unsatisfactory."
5,The technique of lighting,"I had to study 'Amistad' for a year 12 assignment and I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It was definitely an eye opener to me as to how African slaves were treated. The performances from the actors was incredible. Cinque was an extremely important character and was often portrayed as being 'Christ-like'. He was often seen in light and in the court room scenes he was wearing light coloured clothes. Cinque was also seen as the 'head' of the other black slaves. They all looked up to him and admired him. Due to the technique of lighting, the viewer is shown that Cinque and the other slaves are the 'good', and the Americans are the 'bad'. Characters in the film who were siding with the Africans were all seen in light, while others, for example the Spanians, were seen in dark lighting.Overall, I feel that Spielberg did a fantastic job with this film and the technique of lighting was very effective in portraying certain views to the audience."
2,Melodramatic courtroom drama disguised as slave history,"This movie could be really good if it focused on the Middle Passage. The brief segement on the slave ship was by far the best sequence in the film. But the rest of the movie is dull, sappy, and overblown.Also, its not very historically accurate. This is not a problem dramatically (""Nixon"" for example:great drama, horrible history), but its a personal pet peeve of mine. Also, as a history teacher, I find it disturbing that teachers were encouraged to use the film for educational purposes when it was released."
3,NOT SPIELBERG'S CUP OF TEA,"One of the most repulsive opening scenes in recent memory.Even a great director like SPIELBERG can reach a low point sometimes.It's hard to imagine why STEVEN has chosen such a subject among all the projects he enconters.It's like a guy experimenting cocaine for the first time;he doesn't remember where he is or where is coming from.I at least enjoyed ANTHONY HOPKINS'S performance as ADAMS,but those boring courtroom scenes really made me look at my watch more than twice.This is a misfire to say the least.Avoid this film and don't make the mistake of buying it.This is a DVD for masochists only."
1,Astonishingly awful - but not unexpected.,"This movie would have succeeded if it had starred Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Leslie Nielson and Dan Ackroyd. It's so appallingly acted, scripted and directed that it amounts to a laughable parody of a 'serious' subject matter. An exercise in sickly false sentiment with the requisite maudlin musical score that has become Spielberg's unmistakable trademark.It is really nothing more than a boring - and equally badly made - derivative of the TV mini-series 'Roots' that was inflicted on us some 20 years ago. A cynical and inevitably failed attempt by Spielberg to gain recognition, legitimacy, and status as an auteur filmmaker. He should stick to what he does best: catering to his uncritical and adoring fans."
2,SPIELBERG SHOULD STOP ACTING LIKE MOTHER THERESA,"I almost fell asleep watching that movie, I was a huge bore. I was sorry to feel that way because I really admire Morgan Freeman and Anthony Hopkins. This movie wasn't convicing, too long, Many movies about afroamericans struggle were made and most of them were better. Even spielberg had done a great job with THE COLOUR PURPLE."
1,bad!!!!!!!!!!!,"well the acting was good, the production was good. but what makes it bad. the fact it was very historically unreliable. obviously they didn't really research their story well enough. they just wanted to make a movie that told this story. some people wondered, why did this movie didn't get nominated for best picture. well, duh!!!"
5,Great!,"Arrived in only a couple days! Great movie, brand new dvd in original packaging, would recommend to everyone looking for this movie!"
2,ARROGANT TRY...,"This director is so arrogant, that it makes me furious. THis is clear in this movie, that just doesn't take off anytime. The depth of character is much less than ""SCHINDLER'S LIST"", and it is obvious for anyone who watched this movie that Spielberg was aiming for a lot of OSCARS! Há, há, há! He didn't get it, because the plot is weak."
1,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS FOLLOWING ITEM - AMISTAD-DVD,"To date, I have not received the item, Amistad - DVD. I have received all of the other items. I received the item ordered with Amistad and I have not received a response from the seller to inform me if the item is not available.Please let me know if this item is available, if it has been mailed, and how it can be tracked for delivery. I would appreciate this information very much.Thank you,La Verne Edmond"
2,sentimentalized distortion of historical events,"Full of stereotypes, cliches and bad acting. This movie relies on the viewer having a strong sense of entitlement and thus being aloof of the less than subtle insults aimed at caucasians. The film notes the African's language had not developed abstract words such as ""if"". The script tells us the Africans are morally superior and thus their language does not need the word ""IF"". Because ""you either do something or you don't"", the African leader sagely informs us. Who are the buffoons in this film? The Christians who devote their time to protest against slavery are depicted as useless and referred to as ""those miserable people"". Good music, scenery, and comic relief were not featured in this film."
4,Powerful Drama,"Yet another winning performance by Morgan Freeman. Realistic in everyway, great for all who love a good drama, filled with emotion."
3,A Magnificent Story in Search of a Good Script,"It is difficult to believe that the same man who made Schindler's List could have made this painfully earnest, hopelessly editorialized ""version of events."" All this [true] story needed was to be told, simply and straightforwardly. It's been crying out to be told ever since the issues it raises were [somewhat] settled by the American Civil War. But the minute I heard that disembodied chorus of voices on the soundtrack, always reserved for the most solemn subjects, I could tell Speilberg was floundering. Schindler's List was so chaste, so reticent in its presentation of the [true] story, that it was Speilberg's greatest triumph that he managed to tell it without any of his usual filmic flourishes - lavished on his usual trivialities. The tale of Amistad deserved the same care and reticence - after all, the story could easily tell itself. What Spielberg lacked was a script. An A for effort, though."
2,Spielberg does another one by the numbers,"Once again Speilberg shows that he knows how to push the buttons -- right from the opening scene, where the action is illuminated by lightning flashes at unrealistically short intervals. Go for the reptile brain with those flashing lights, Steve. Where this movie finally lost it for me, though, was in the courtroom. Why would Spielberg hire one of the world's great actors (Anthony Hopkins) to play one of America's great orators, have him deliver a wonderful speech, and then paste a syrupy musical soundtrack over the whole thing? This seems to me typical of the director's work -- his estimation of us is that we lack the intelligence or emotional depth to frame our own reactions to events, so he manipulates us with flashing lights and elevator music. Unfortunately, judging by the customer ratings this and other movies of his have received, his estimate of the majority of movie-goers is correct."
5,A Must See for every American,A very moving film about slave trade and how they were KIDNAPPED/STOLEN/SNATCHED from their homes and families in Africa and tortured (as always by greedy white men) during the agonizing trip on the slave ship Amistad and their experience in the United States. By Stephen Spielburg
4,The ship sails,"Definitely NOT one of the better known Steven Speilberg movies in India, which is the only disappointing thing about this movie. If one wants to know what acting is, watch Anthony Hopkins in this movie and you shall know why he is called Sir Anthony. Must watch."
5,best stuff,I work outside everyday. when i have these on its like the cold weather doesnt exist. Wind doesnt come through them. They last for years. What more could you want.
2,discontinued item,unable to provide a review because item has been discontinued and order was not filled
2,buzz sound,I purchased my advent tv 32 in flat screen at Best Buy in Reno Nev.I have only had it for 6 months and now it makes a buzzing sound coming out of the speaker that makes it almost impossible to watch unless your deaf.I was dissapointed to find out that although it is still under factory warranty its my responsibility to bring this 300 pound tv infor repair.Not only that I have called the manufacturer warrenty service twice in the last month and they said they would get back to me which they never did.Ifinally got ahold of Best Buy and they said they would call and see what the problem was. Still no responce.
1,Bio Balance,I thought this book would have been more informing in terms of which foods are alkaline and which foods are acid. (Pasta is never mentioned) This book tends to be long-winded on annonymous medical histories. It is redundant and superfluous. This book could be 1/3 the size.
2,A Messed Up Puzzle,"Apparently, I am an odd-shaped piece that doesn't fit this puzzle. I tried the alkaline diet and was totally spaced out, jittery from coffee, etc. The acid diet made me tired and heavy. The combination diet made my stomach crazy. This book is similar to many others on the market and did not work for me. Maybe it works for some people, but not for all. I'm off to keep looking."
2,Confused!,"I was disappointed with this book because it seemed to contradict every other acid/alkaline piece of information I found on the web. I had done a lot of reading beforehand and bought this book because it seemed to offer the ultimate advice on acid and alkaline foods in your diet. The case studies were interesting and it all made sense (ie the problems of imbalance) until it came to the diet info. Information I read beforehand indicates that generally fruit and veg are alkaline and meat/fish/bread are acid. This book confused me with listings showing contradictory info. It may well be about a certain type of diet that helped people but I cannot find one other piece of evidence to support his listings of WHICH foods are acid and alkaline (in fact, completely opposite in most cases) so it just left me very confused."
2,BioBalance,"Before purchasing this book I'd check it out of the library. In order to follow the diet advice one must first go to the doctor and have some blood work. Specifically, ""you will undergo a series of blood tests for venous plasma pH and a test for candidiasis"". ""Venous plasma pH will be measured at various times during each of three days."" If you are easily able to do this then read this book.The book covers a review of various other diets from macrobiotics to PMS. If this is what you are looking for then this is helpful.However, if you would like to be able to evaluate yourself and then follow a specific diet style read ""The Metabolic Typing Diet"" by Wolcott. After taking an extensive questionnaire you will type yourself and proceed from there. The book is an excellent read and delivers what you would expect."
1,Biobalance : Using Acid_Alkaline Nutrition,"Any book that requires you to go get all these blood test is not very practical. Oh yes, like my HMO will go buy me the required blood testing equipment, NOT! The book may be great, however it will not help you unless you can get a doctor to give you a blood ph test that they normally don't test for. Plus, it is not just one test. You have to do about 4 blood test or more over a period of time to find your true ph balance. Maybe if you had some major problems you wouldn't mind all the test. However, if you just want some good practical advice on acid/alkaline balance, continue looking."
1,"These ""Readers"" are Just the Author Promoting Himself",The book is nonsense. The author has attempted to promote himself by writing phony reviews.
1,Unbalanced Book,"It wasn't until page 133 out of 198 internal pages did I finally get useful information on how the plan works. Prior to page 133 it was filled with repetitive comments on how Dr. Wiley funded his own research and has no more money. It also contained detailed drawbacks to other programs such as Fit for Life, Pritikin, and many more. His message was harsh and not well written.I am well-read and have been told by those with a master's degree in nutrition that I understand the chemical process of nutrition better than they do. I say this to help the reader of this review understand that I was expecting a detailed book on 'The Acid/Alkaline solution to the Food-Mood-Health Puzzle"" not a book on how bad other programs are and that more research isn't possible because the Dr. ran out of money.This is the first negative review I've ever written as well.I will continue looking to find a book that addresses the acid/alkaline issue."
5,"Excellent Book, A Must Read!","This book is what I have been searching for. I have noticed a connection between the foods that I eat and my mood and my mental alertness. I could not find an exact pattern. Dr. Wiley spent 20 years of research to figure this out. Dr. Wiley isn't one who is easily persuaded by small amounts of evidence. He demands proof. This book is worth it weight in gold. Buy the book, take the pH test, change your diet, change your life!"
1,Biobalance,"A physicist, the author of this book doesn't get to the diet until page 133 of a 172-page book. You'll find the actual diet in the Appendix! What is the rest of the book devoted to? Expounding on the evils of other diets and psychotherapy. It's not that the author is wrong in his stipulation that pH balance in the body may be the most important aspect of health and nutrition; however, 1.) he takes a very narrow view of a large picture, and 2.) he doesn't help you gain an understanding of balancing pH in your body. (Plus he wastes a lot of the reader's time trying to convince you about the value of his diet based on his anecdotal experiences.) If you want to learn the basic principles involved (which explain why some of this author's recommendations might actually make sense), read Sang Whang's ""Reverse Aging."" The book is also a much more pleasant read lacking the harranging and condescension of Dr. Wiley's book."
2,Promotes bad dietary habits,"While we certainly do not know everything there is to know about all the effects of eating certain foods, there are foods known (proven) to cause serious health problems if consumed liberally. This book, in many cases, promotes eating such foods as staples in given diets. In my honest opinion, the book is irresponsible since it does not point out the possible negative effects of following the bad diets it promotes. The book was, however, interesting reading -but- (again - in my opinion) should be sold as fiction."
5,Sturdy/ Snug & Stylish,"The case is leather with a magnetic closure (I originally thought that would be a problem... but it holds to be sturdy), & it is very stylish. The only thing that I would have wanted more... is a small closed area for a extra battery & card."
4,Very dense,"Rather than a textbook for a ""teaching of secondary science"" course, this is better as a reference book. Way too much material for one semester's, maybe even two semesters', work. Every page of the lightweight paper is packed with information. Good information (as much as I've used), but the text-size is small, there is little ""white space"", and the language is jargony.In other words, if you already know a lot about teaching science, this is an excellent refresher or reference book, but very intimidating for a beginning teacher or even for a graduate-level course."
2,Lock feature is useless.,"This was very easy to install. Ignore the review where they state to cut the hole after you install it. It's impossible to install the door without the hole already being cut. I installed this on my screen door from my screened in porch. All you do to install, is hold up one side of the pet door to the screen, cut the screen, leaving some slack to attach to the pet door, then snap the other side on. No need to remove your door to install the pet door (as stated in instructions).The complaint that I have about this thing is the locking feature. If you lock the pet door, your pet can easily just push the whole pet door through the screen (the pet door casing and all). It is so annoying always having to put the door back up, after my cat knocks it down. Purchase this pet door, knowing that you won't be able to lock it close."
4,Pet door that mounts in a screen,Great product - lousy instructions. Install the door on the screen before cutting the screen. Cutting the hole first gives you a saggy screen.
4,B+,"We tried to install it without cutting the screen first and it wouldn't work. We have thick ""pet proof"" screen on our door, and even though it's not metal we had to cut the screen on the metal template. As soon as we did that it worked like a charm. I don't think the locking feature works very well. The door can be pushed right out. Instead we followed another reviews advice and installed it in the middle of the door so that we can close the glass door half way so we can stop the dogs from going out if we don't want them to, but still let the fresh air in. It was pretty simple to install, and easy for the dogs to learn to use."
4,i wouldn't be without it,i love this pet screen door this is my second one the first one lasted 3 yrs. i wish it was a little sturdier but it is about the only option for small dogs within a reasonable price. when this one breaks i will get another one.
1,This is garbage.,"Bought this from a local pet store to use on a lanai screen. Advertised as being able to install on screen doors or screen panels (as in lanais). Well the directions show someone removing a door and hammering it into place. A little difficult to do if your trying to mount it on a screen panel in a lanai. Two of us working together have not been able to get these pieces to come together. Have a feeling I'm going to end up drilling holes in it and bolting it together. What a joke!*edit* Looking at other reviews, I'm wondering if there was a change in the design. I see references to pins and rubber pieces. What we have is solid plastic where a male plastic channel mates to a female completely around the perimeter. It appears others with a similar design have expressed grief with installing it as well."
3,"OK for cats AND dogs, but not for cats only.","Easy to install, but I wanted access for only my cats on my pool deck. The photo showed a cat coming through the door, but my 100 lb. dog also managed to squeeze through and carried the frame with him. I had to rescreen the door and replaced the pet door with a smaller door which works fine for my cats."
2,not quite,"I've gotten two of these and they work pretty well once you get them installed up to a point. it's a press fit. after a few weeks the cats continued to knock it out of the screen so I had to drill holes and fit small bolts to hold it in place. no big deal but not what I expected. that lasted for about a year and then the door simply broke off at the hinge. ok, a years worth of service. not bad. bought a replacement. the press fit did not work at all so I installed it from the beginning with bolts - although I had to be careful as the plastic on this one is softer. put the screen back in, flicked the door a few times... and the magnet on the new one is so weak a small breeze will hold it open. so yes, it works, but certainly not what I expected. I have my doubts on how long this replacement will last and next time I'll have to replace the screen and will be trying a different manufacturer."
4,Fair worth for the money,"This is not what I would call heavy duty, in fact it's fairly thin & flimsy. Considering it fits right into the screen it's about all you can expect.Installation was easy! Just cut screen to fit & snap two halves from opposite sides. I did reinforce the corners with glue mostly because I have 2 small & VERY ACTIVE dogs...The dogs took to it easily & within 2 says are running in & out on their own so it worked out very well overall."
3,Novel concept lacking quality,"This pet door is a very novel concept for someone who loves to have their screen door open. The product itself is not design well. Whenever my dog would go through the door, it would fall out, becasue the frame did not attached onto the screen well. We redesigned it by drilling holes around the frame and putting screws through them. This made a major differnce. The frame now stays in the screen when my dog uses the door."
2,Just cut a hole in your screen instead,"Don't bother. After paying $23 and slowly breaking the plastic that ""locks"" the 2 sides together, we realized that we could just cut a flap in our screen door and it would leave just the same amount of bug coverage as as a door. It's not like the cat door does anything except make the cats push open a heavyish door anyways...no security or anything added.It's fine, but just think about it in case that would work for you too."
2,A little weak,"OK mission accomplished, my cat can now get out of our screened in porch. However the product is not extremely well designed. It is pretty tricky to install yourself and I am pretty handy. It has fallen off a few times now. I didn't find many alternatives so I guess this is it.Update: After re-installing 3 times I have retired this product. It just does not work well."
2,Flimsy Screen,"I have now had this pet screen door for 1 year now and the cats have scratched holes in the screen. These holes allow the mosquitoes to come in the house - not good. I called the company to inquire about removing the movable part to change the screen, but am told that is not possible. I have to replace the whole thing and that means taking the screen door to have a whole screen replaced in order to put in the PetSafe screen door. The problem is that the screen in the pet screen door is too flimsy. It should be screen material that is scratch resistant. All the screens in our home are such screens."
5,This thing makes my cats soooooooo happy,"My cats now go outside to do their business, which is a big plus for me. They now have a huge outdoor cage with many perches and a view of butterflies and birds. This little door makes it all possible."
4,personal view of country music history being made,"I attended this book's release party, which was also a birthday party for Tillman Franks. It was a wonderful day, filled with great music. As Faron Young's biographer, I made many contacts who were later helpful to me. Franks wrote an important story, and I enjoyed reading about all the familiar names. What detracted from the book was its lack of editing--numerous typos and other errors. Still, it contains much valuable information about people like Jerry Kennedy, Glenn Sutton, David Houston, Johnny Horton, Claude King, and many others."
4,a good CD player,"A very basic, dependable CD player that will last. It is small and easy to carry around and it can ues both AA and AAA batteries which makes it easy to dig up unused batterys around the house for it.Its not a big, fancy MP3 and radio playing player but with anti skip features and its programable track memory, it workes for most people. I givethis 4 out of 5 stars."
1,This is a bunch of CRAP!,"Snoop always talks about crip life, shooting people, and drugs. How the hell are you doing that with a video produced by the Neptunes! Snoop's lyrics in his new CD suck! It use to atleast make sense. Now it just sucks. But his dancing is tight..atleast have to give him that!"
1,Quite A let Down!!!!,"Ever since leaving the West to hook up with No Limit Records, Snoop has been putting out paltry, sorry albums. The beats in this one are lame and nondescript, the rhymes boring and lacking the flow of old days. Snoop must go back and hook up with Dre again, to regain the magic of his glory days or it is the end of the road for him. Aside from Pass it Up, all the songs suck and don't deserve our hard earned dollars. I am shocked at the rave reviews people are putting here! Come on let's be real: this album sucks!!!!!! Lyrically and musically...."
1,Gangtsa???,"Since when is Justin Timberlake and Nelly gangster? these guys are tools made by ""The industry"". Bunk CD, save your money."
1,Uh...no. Sorry. Not for me. NEXT!,"First off I'd like to say that I'm not a mindless rap basher, or ""hater"" as I suppose I would be called. I do like some ""old school"" hip-hop. Okay, not as much as I like rock, jazz or soul music, but the old stuff is good fun, if not terribly memorable.Now Gangsta Rap seriously pisses me off. Why? For a variety of reasons. For one, you need ZERO talent. You certainly don't have to be a good lyricist - all it takes is a bunch of ""gangsta"" cliches with occasional sex thrown in for good measure. Oh, I'm sorry. Rap isn't about the lyrics...r i i i g h t. It's about the beats. If that's true then what purpose do the lyrics serve in the first place? Well? So considering that this is virtually the same as a 50 Cent album..."
2,"Not as good as ""Doggystyle!""",Snoop just loves bending over and taking it from behind from his beloved cuzzin DAZ!
1,Weak,Sink yo money into the new AFroman disks...He cares about his listeners and the music wontdisappoint. some real west coast music
1,Buy the CLEAN version instead,"I needed this CD for a Jazzercise class, but the cursing was too much to cover up so I went to Walmart (which I hate) just so I could get the clean version."
1,DO NOT BUY.....WORST SNOOP CD AND WORST OF 2005,"now i been listening to snoop since doggystyle...this his worst cd....if you want good snoop buy the chronic, doggystyle the doggfather or any no limit cdmy order of snoop cd's best to worstdoggystyle 5starsdoggfather 4 starsthe game is to be sold not to be told 4starsdead man walkin 3.5 starstop dogg 3.5 starslast meal 3.5 starspaid tha cost to be the boss 3starsR&G; 0 stars"
1,Downhill from doggystyle,"Umm...I havent listened to the whole cd but from what i have listened to and from snoops last few cd's i'm going to say this one is absolute trash. And to people who are reading these reviews...you have obviously listened to the garbage single 'drop it like it hot'. Now the people who are giving this album 5 stars are rating that song the best...eg. that guy who gave it a 6/5. So come on, if Drop it like its hot is the best song on this cd...it has to be a pretty crappy cd."
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE,"I hate to give it one star but "" drop it like its hot "" was cool till' every fm radio station in the world had to play it 500 times a day.awww where to i begin on this...lets just say ive been a fan of snoop since WAY back in the days when he was a cool kat with corn rolls and baggy gangsta shirts. Now....well..Hes got all the money he needs so need for that.Bottom line is this album has to be right up there with the [...] album ever. The only thing I liked on it was them bringing back dj eazy [...] from his deathrow days ...and that was only 30 seconds."
2,Not His Best.,"You know, I used to like Snoop alot. He used to be one of the best rappers out. Now, he's just average. I mean there are a few songs on this album which are cool, but for the most part it sucked, I'm reading all these reviews saying this is his best release since Doggystyle. ???. I don't think so. If Snoop still had Dre doin his beats, then maybe that would bring his style back, but I'm just not feelin The Neptunes production on this album. And Pherrel.......(Sigh)..........I just don't know why he thinks he can sing. But anyway, if you're hoping to hear ""Snoop Doggy Dogg"" And Not ""Snoop Dogg"" then this album is not recommended. And if you do get this album thinkin I don't know what I'm talking about, you should only listen to ""The Blindness"" and ""Snoop D O Double G"". thats about it though. (Sigh) Oh God Please Bring The Old Snoop Back......."
5,Still D.O. Double G.,"Snoop Dogg is still doing is thang.That boy that came out ihn 1993 hungry for more, is now more hungry than before.But now he's more mature and he now knows the game and he is on the top of his game.Everybody wants to sing with Snoop and this is one of his best.He pulls out new lyrics every time.The rap game now belongs to Snoop and he's on the hall of fame of Hip Hop.Snoop 4Ever"
4,The Album Is Pretty Good,This Album Was Done Well.I just Got off Work and saw Them Filming The Video.Snoop Is still Gansta
4,SNOOOOOOOOOOOOP,"I don't know why so many people hate this album it's not that bad. It does have some bad songs like Oh no f/ 50 cent and Girl like U f/ Nelly. Other then that it is good. He has some newer guests on this album like Lil Jon, and Trina. Best songs on the album are Step Yo Game Up f/ Lil Jon, Trina, Drop It like It's Hot f/ Pharrell"
4,Very Good,"I know that I don't often get Snoop's CD's, but getting this one was worth the money that I paid for it. Most of the tracks are great(i.e. Drop It Like It's Hot, Step Yo Game Up, Let's get Blown), but a couple weren't that good.Despite that couple of average tracks, this CD is a must have item for any Snoop fan."
4,Snoop-OK William Hungee- big time sucka (turn el rojo soon),"I is pimpin al ""DAMN"" Snoop is all rite. He not as pimp as Luda an Lil' Jon but he kinda gangsta. He pimper than william Hungee. he beat down suckas. Drop it like it's hot-. pimp."
1,Whoops!,"Snoop should not have become involved with the Neptunes - their sound is meant for rapid consumption and disposal and is already dated. Snoop was recently involved with Nate Dogg and Warren G as 213 and they produced a phenomenal album entitled The Hard Way - if you like Snoop Dogg, and you should, try this instead."
1,It wouldn't let me put 0 stars,"Do not buy this garbage. Snoop is way past his prime. Now he is just a weed smoking, bad music producing sellout. I can't tell if he was high when he was writing his lyrics or if he has just become retarded, but all his rhyming abilities have left him, so he just adds an ""-izzle"" to the end of every word so he can rhyme any words he wants. Here is a little sample straight from ""Drop it Like It's Hot,"" the worst song of 2004.

2,ew,"the R&B songs on here totally suck. Seriously. Theres only 3 good songs on here. Oh No, Drop It Like Its Hot, and Step Yo Game Up is alright. All other songs are absolutely terrible. I bought this CD for $4 and im regretting it."
1,BEST 4 WHITE TEENAGE MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS.,"I read i wasnt just supposed to write 1 word reviews, so:THIS ALBUM IS REALLY, REALLY SH*T!!Snoop aint a G no more, He sold himself for the money.R&G; (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, it aint a Masterpiece, it contains commercial tracks best suited to teenage white middle class americans who want to rebel by listening to 'gangsta rap' songs like signs with his fellow 'gangsta' Justin Timberlake.....gangsta this aint."
5,Wow,"Next to DoggyStyle, this is the best album that Snoop Dogg has ever put out. From front to back ""R&G; (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece"" is truly that, a MASTERPIECE. Here's how I the songs on Snoop's new CD.Songs: 2. Bang Out-4/53. Drop It Like It's Hot-5/54. Can I Get a Flicc Witchu-5/55. Ups & Downs-5/56. The Bidness-5/57. Snoop D.O. Double G-5/58.

""R&G;( Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece""."
1,abysmal,"Snoop Dogg really lacks effort on this cd. Which has dissapointing songs, and his drop it likes it hot single is boring."
2,"8,9,10 TKO",This album is selling on its name alone.Only someone who just heard the chronic album and is now into snoop would go and buy this album.Old Snoop fans realized after the Dogfather that he has sampled the majority of the Old Skool tracks from the 60-and 70's and his pimp persona has lost it Fizzle for shizzle my nizzle.The only CD I suggest you buy is a DVD of Girls gone Wild if you want Snoop Highlights.He should be in his prime and he already has a greatest hits and it is struggling in sells. He is officially knock out of the game and needs Dr.Dre to spoon feed him some lyrical medicine. This is a poison ivy recording you want to scratch it up and make sure it never plays.
5,yO YO,"This new CD from Snoop is a breath of fresh air compared to some of his previous releases. Snoop is an amazing lyrisist. He flows over tight beats on this album with a buttery slickness that only he posesses. He may not be a ""preachy"" spoken word geeky MC that just mumbles on about ""issues"" behind sub-par beats. He's an MC...aka...Master of the ceremony....aka Master of the party. People who want to party, cop this album, CHUUUUUUUUURCH."
5,Snoop Dogg holds it down.,"To say the least, I am very impressed. Snoop Dogg has been in the rap industry for 10 years, and he is still on top of things. The production by the Neptunes and its producers are a work of art. The lyrics from Snoop Dogg fit each song, and the whole album flows together. Any music lover can appreciate is consistency, fluidity, and the intricate rythms on this album. No matter what the mood, this album has a song for it. This album is a must buy. The masterpiece must be respected."
1,Please stop!!!!!!! You are killing me,"Can Snoop be humane? Why is he punishing the world with his presence. Please give me some relief and stop rapping. Lets take it from the top. Doggystyle is an absolute dope album from front to back, but ALL of his albums after that suck. How could you be a grown man and get pimped by the Bishop Magic Don Juan (CHURCH LOL!!!!!)? To make matters worse you are 45 years old and still claiming to be a crip!!!!!!! Snoop is another official BEAT WASTER. Give the dope beats to someone who knows how to spit bars."
1,GARBAGE!!!!,"I'm looking through all these reviews and I'm wondering If I was listening to the right CD. I say this because after listening to it I must say it is a piece of GARBAGE!!!! I don't know how people can say this is even a decent CD much less a classic. Snoop hasn't been the same since he and Dre split. I don't know why everybody thinks just because he signed w/Startrak (or however how it's spelled) it's a hot album. It just goes to show how people are under the belief that just because something is different it's good. well guess what people, sometimes you gotta stick w/what got you there. Dre please call Snoop aand talk some sense into him. Or at least slap some sense into Pharrell. And for those that gave it a rating of 3 or above, LEARN SOME GRAMMAR AND LEARN HOW TO TYPE!!!!"
2,Beware of Bogus Average Customer Reviews,"Pass It Pass It & Drop It Like It's Hot were the only songs I liked a lot. I gotta agree with Matt Faith. When I saw Timberlake's name on the album I was put off as well. Nelly? That guys a sell out Snoop? & if you're making music with him, you're probably just as bad.The things a dog'll do for a dollar - that's what Snoops next album should be called!!!As for all these fake reviews under separate a alias - please stop it!!! When I made this review the album was 4.5 stars average customer rating the same as Nas `Street Disciple' - gimme break, this albums gotta be like a frisby compared to `Street Disciple'. It's really sad that I now know that a Customer Average rating means nothing - Amazon please do something about this???Carl Wayne is just as bad as the guy posting with a fake alias. He has posted a review as John Frederick 2 reviews below Carl Waynes. It is terribly obvious..."
1,Drop It Like It's Hot??? Wait This Album Isn't Hot.....,"While I have always liked Snoop this might be one of his worst albums. I mean am I the only one that things a 5yr old could have wrote Drop It Like It's Hot? I mean the song doesnt have one great verse that stands out. I miss the old Snoop, [...] the one you didnt want your kids listening to. Also am I the only one that thinks all these reviews are from the same person. They all are one line and say the same thing, and it's the only album they have reviewed. Anyways it's not his best, so just chill to the next episode..."
4,why,"i havnt heard the full cd yet but i love the song drop it like its hot. When i heard that snoop actually had a looser like justin timberlake on the cd it made me have second thoughts about buying the cd. Snoop, what were you thinking?"
4,HOT STUFF,"best songs""Drop It Like It's Hot"" (featuring Pharrell)""Oh No"" (featuring 50 Cent)""Let's Get Blown""""Signs"" (featuring J.T. & Charlie Wilson)""Step Yo Game Up"" (featuring Lil' Jon & Trina)second place""Snoop D.O.G.G.""""No Thang On Me""""Girl Lke U"" (featuring Nelly)"
3,come on snoop,The major labels dont get it yet artist like this should be banned! There nowere near the quality of a Traum or Cormega yet they get all the light please help us. Labels like Masta Mix Records wouldnt even talk to these cats and the dirty south is running rap byt the cant rap thanks to the majors!!!!
3,Wow they hated on this one..,"Go get yourself a cup of haterade, you damn haters. I just pulled up this CD because of course I am great reviewer and I like to review CD's and read other reviews in my spare time.. and I saw not one, not two, but FOUR people give this CD one star.. why did you even listen to this CD if you hate snoop so much? More important why did you write a review? Damn folks. Snoop doesn't come as tight on this one as he did for Tha Doggfather or Tha Last Meal, and of course it's not as good as Doggystyle, but this is still a tight CD. I can't bring myself to give it 4 stars because I keep it real with my reviews, and some of these songs are kinda boring when you compare it to Snoop's older stuff. But one star?! Come on folks.. this is the one and only D-O-Double-G.. how can you hate that much? I like this CD a lot actually. I wouldn't give it 4 stars but it's still tight. I bump it. You should too."
2,Just Isn't Snoop Enough,"This has got to be one girly album. It's too soft anyway, anyhow. Not gangsta enough. This isn't R&G, more like R&B to me. The only two songs that stand out to be tight is the ones you hear on the radio a lot - Drop It Like It's Hot and Girl Like U. Snoop D.O Double G is aight, Step Yo Game Up is hella annoyin' with Lil' Jon, thank God for comedy and having Dave Chappelle clown on him. And what were you thinkin' bringin' Justin Timbelake in the scene? Sign is one wack track. If this was Snoop's first album, he would've been a One Hit Wonder."
1,drop it like it's NOT!!!,"good grief, what has happened to the ol' G from long beach. sighhh. i miss the doggystyle and chronic days. :( if you ain't catch my drift yet, the album is horrible. there ain't no gangsta in this album, just R&B. i mean, good god, justin timberlake and the bee gees are on it. enough said!!!"
3,Where is the Snoop i grew up listening to?????,"ok this is not a traditonal Snoop Cd....where is Nate and Warren G.....where is Daz...where is Dre.....where is Xzibit...where is Mr. Kane and E-white... i guees he rather have no talented garbage like Justion Timberlake and Nelly on his CD... he is lucky Drop it likes its hot is a hot track... 50 Cent is featured on a song ""Oh No"" probably the best track on the CD.. also who takes Justion Timberlake seriously when he say ""Don't F**k with me"".... snoop maybe it is tyme to throw in the towel its hard for me to say that cuz he is on my top 3 favortie rappers"
5,Still,"Snoop is still the best in the business.I dont know when snoop is goiyn to stop,I think he nerver stops, party all the time.This cd is tight.Good choice of snoop to sign with star trak.Now its super power with doggystyle and star trak together.Another classic by snoop.Peace"
5,portugal,snoop eu sou 1 f teu de portugal.adoro ver o videoclip do drop it like it's hot.ja komprei o teu cd e ta mt sebem.ta m bue fx.gostava k viexes a portugal.
5,Great,From the beginning to the end of R&G; I was shocked because I didn't had to skip one track.Snoop proved to be the king of hip hop and rap.The songs are great with very good lyrics and very good beats.Snoop is mature but is still keeping it gangsta.Songs like Oh no are very gangsta but no thang on me it shows another side of Snoop.I love this cd and I think you should buy it if you like good music.5
1,SELL-OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I used to like Snoop Dogg before he sold out to POP!Back in the day he made classics like Gin and Juice and Nothin' but a 'G' Thang.Now I dislike him because he makes cheap music like Drop It Like Its Hot,Let's Get Blown and the song that made me dislike Snoop now and forever,Signs featuring Charlie Wilson and...I ain't ready yet....the GAYest of them GAY people,Justin Pussylake!!!"
2,Snoop still on the Pop Pass,"Snoop is a Real Young Cat,but Musically he is headed toward the Old Folks Home any day now. stil setlting for just getting by as to braching anything that has any edge. I know it can't be 19992-1994 for Him any longer,but he just still uses bits&Pieces of that time to move himself into now,but the Problem is you Miss Dr.Dre or someone that would truly shake some New Life into this Cat. I Respect Snoops Hustle,but He is comfortable Being a One trick Pony. he has settled for Less&that has robbed Fans of a VOice that truly still should be on the Edge as to just getting by."
1,Master Piece of Sh#t,"Just look at the titles of people who like this: they can't even speak proper english and they think that's cool! Amazing! Snoop used to have skills and brought something to the table, but now he's just coasting on his rep, fans' ignorance, and because somehow people find 'shizzle' and other words cool. And his misogyny is really sickening! Snoop should stick to acting, even though he pretty much plays the same character in each film. Mr. 'Dizzle' is one of the main reasons why there is so much contempt towards rap music, along with a few choice others. This kind of rap is shallow, and offers nothing! If you can't play an instrument, they say, at least perform lyrics that are worthwhile! C'mon folks, wake the hell up and ignore rap music like this, it's giving those who are dedicated to the Kulture a bad name! Oh nevermind, you should pick this one up and while you're at it buy the new ones from Chingy, Lil' Jon, Fabolous, and Ja Rule. Yes! That would be a great investment."
1,snoop dogg blows,this is the worst cd in the world. snoop dogg fell off a long time ago and he sucks now. don't buy this cd
2,"It Was Ok, A Masterpiece?","I think that this is by far his worste album no contest, how can he call it his masterpiece?I am very suspicious that he only spent about a month making this album after making Drop-It-Like-It's-Hot. I think that he just wanted to get that hit out as soon as possible to make a lot of money while the song was still popular. It's really obvious that he did, because almost every track is complete crap. I have to say that hands down this is by far the worste rap album I've ever bought. Every track was a huge dissapointment, and I think he isn;t even trying to make good music anymore.I would reomend an earlier album, but not this."
2,Stuck In The Last Groove,"I don't know, this stuff is funny and everything and it was really jarring and fresh in it's day, but when it's all said and done - it's a gimmick, not music.Much like Big Boys' contributions to Outkast's last record, most every song is comprised of a cool beat, a catchy chorus and a guy repeating a bunch of one liners you've heard a million times.Someone else wrote the hook, someone else wrote the beat, and a Dogg be frontin'."
1,fazzisle my sizzle,"can you say gay???? hip hop sucks, Snoop dogg is anoying. He looks like a friggin rat! for real music, get The Doors or The Sex Pistols."
1,Snoop Dog---A Great Talent and Handsome Too!,"Snoop Dog is a wonderfully sophisticated, erudite gentleman of the old school whose continental charms and gentle, poignant lyrics (especially those espousing beating up his woman) add so much musically, culturally and morally to our civilization. Furthermore, he is also incredibly handsome, sort of in a Cary Grant-ish way, don't you think? What a romantic---so subtle and witty. Classically handsome: move over Cary Grant, get lost Clark Gable, forget it Paul Newman; here's a real hunk of a man---Snoop Dog. A real charmer. Hey, has he raped anybody this week?"
5,Quality AND Quantity,"At first when you see twenty tracks, you think its gonna be a bunch of garbage. But skippin from track to track, there is nothing but hotness. To the few who diss it: man ya'll obviously have no rhythem and couldn't feel a hot beat and flow if they tried. Da big boss dogg and the neps tear it up once again (tracks 3,8,10,16,18)snooooooooooooooooooooop."
3,Not the best album,"Man I'm a huge Snoop Dogg fan but this album isn't all that. Drop it like it's hot,man thats song is weak. But I do like Lets get blown, now that's some good rap right there. But why would snoop have that little punk justin timberlake on his album. Come on man why not add some more rappers like master p, or Ice cube. Anyway good but not that great from snoop. Best album is tha last meal and doggy style."
1,garbage @ss album. not worth the $1.07 i paid at allofmp3,"snoop raps about nothing. the songs are not deep, or heartfelt, just whipped up commercial trash. and its even trashy for that genre. and the beats simply suck! drop it like its hot sounded very original with the clicking and the drums, but none of the other songs have anything unique or good. it was painful to not be able to listen through a full song of snoop's. sad effort by someone who has put out lots of masterpeices, this album isnt worth the effort to push next song after hearing the first minute."
5,Great Cd,"THis is the first time i ever listened to any of Snoop's album. I Like him as a rapper but never enough to buy any of his cds. Also i guess it doesn't help that I am not much a rap fan. However, I loved this album.Honestly he had alot of catch beats and I love the callaborations with Charlie Wilson (great duets), Timberlake, Nelly...all great callobos.But if you are a gangsta rap and was looking for something straight hard core, I would say this is not the album for you. This is a sexy album."
3,Snoop has nothing to rap about anymore.,When you base your career on your name Snoopy do double gizzle u can run out of the things to rap about. THis seems to be the case with snoop . Don't get me wrong i loved snoop when he first came out because it was original but i've hear this crap over and over again rizzle kizzle wo wizzle . He even made me make my user name EVDIZZLE haaha. ITs an ok cd . Oh no is prolly the best song drop it like its hot is hott but ok cd get it if u love snoop do dubble
2,Snoop fell off long time ago!,"Come on let's be real Snoop is not what he was on his death row days, he fell off. this album is not good at all, i'm not feelin it. but if you are die hard snoop fan then i guess you'll like it.OUTLAW"
1,HELLO? WHERE'S THE REAL SNOOP AT?,"What has happened to SNOOP? Looks like ""the last meal"" was his last gangsta cd. I feel sad for him because he is losing fans with his new cd. We all know that snoop dogg could do WAY better. Let's just see if he does better on his new cd coming out soon."
1,Give me a break!,"I've said this a million times before and I'll say it again. NO ONE CARES IF YOUR RICH! NO ONE CARES ABOUT ALL THE GIRLS YOU PAY TO LIKE YOU! NO ONE FREAKIN CARES!!!Sorry about that, but I am getting fed up. The whole ""I'm such a big pimp with girls as skinny as sticks effing me and by the way did I mention how rich I am and how jelous you should be?"" thing is getting old. Fast.Hopefully this whole genre will die out. Go listen to rock, kids. Or even pop. Anything but this!"
2,"yeah, just drop it.",easily the weakest of Dogg's efforts and falls well short of The Doggfather.Next please.
1,Stoopid-Dogg,Stoopid Dogg: NR&S; (No Rythm & Sucks)Drop it Like It's SnotPass it Pass it (Farting Noise)I'm Threw With WitchesMOST RETARDED SOUNDTRACK ON EARTH MY GOD SAVE ME FROM IT'S HORRIBLENESS

1,Snoop Changed!,I miss the old snoop...seems as though his music is a little more low key and not much excitment...wasnt happy at all with any of these songs. Thats too bad.
1,wow,"......so when you rap, you just talk, while a drum machine hits the same rythm again and again.... ok.... what a piece of garbage. I laughed when I first heard this becasue it was so stupid. WOW what a terrible CD... the self obsessed idiot, he was probably so high when he made this album he passed out after every track... The worst album of the worst rapper of the worst kind of music... Good Job Snoop! you've created something genuinly nothing like music I've ever heard, the question still lingers to whether I even consider this music... oh, of course not!Get A Life!!!!!"
2,snoop does it again,i assumed that the neptunes would handle the bulk of the production when i saw he had signed with star trak. that was really the only reason i bought the album. the last snoop album i bought was the last meal so needless to say i gave up on snoop. i bought this album and it turns out the neptunes only did a few beats. basically this album is just as terrible as any other album snoop has released after doggystyle. go buy doggystyle because that's when snoop was on his game.(5 hot songs dont make a hot album so stop giving five star reviews and only naming 5 hot songs.)
5,Masterpiece of a legend,"Snoop made a classic in 1993 with doggystyle and I think this cd can be a classic too.Is a legend just like 2pac,Run-Dmc and Dre.This album is a true masterpiece and can be a classic.RIP all dead rappers"
5,Master Mind,"Another CLASSIC by the immortal rapper Snoop Dogg. Since Doggystyle Snoop is breaking all the guys in the industry and now nobody talks bad about him. Even Fat Joe talks good about ""Drop it Like It's Hot"" in his new cd ""ALL OR NOTHING"". R&G; reached the classic level like ""DOGGYSTYLE"", ""DOGGFATHER"" and ""THE LAST MEAL"". Snoop got the game. All the songs in this cd are the bomb. I don't how but Snoop keeps coming with new fresh lyrics everytime and it keeps getting better and better. Everybody have to buy this one because it's the bomb. Snoop he's not commercial he can think.Snoop paid tha cost to be tha boss."
2,Come on Snoop!,"I hate this cd. I can't believe the reviews other people have posted. I grew up on rap and hip hop, and i have to say, Snoop Dog's latest release is just plain boring. I must confess that i do not listen to Snoop's stuff on a regular basis, so this cd was the first one of his that i have bought. Based on this cd, I think I'm probably finished buying his stuff. The only song I enjoyed on this album was the song with Pharell that is played on MTV all the time. You see, even that song was so mideocre that i can't even remember the name! This album has nothing of interest, the beats are uninteresting, boring, and not energetic at all. The lyrics are definately nothing special, I've heard much better. And the background music lacks melody, energy, originality, and plain interestingness. If you're shopping around for a rap cd I would look into Madvillain, an underground rapper who's lyrics, beats, and background music is fresh and captivating. Don't buy this cd."
5,Still doing it,Snoop is by far the best rapper of all times along with Tupac and the best producer is Dr.Dre. I love this cd more than I love many of Snoop's cds because this is a masterpiece.Good producion and the lyrics are the best by part of Snoop Dogg.I love to see him in Jay Leno last night is always doing something for the kids.He's a gangsta but he's good to everybody.I liked this album because he can rap to rhythm and to gangsta music.He's the hip hop legend and everybody knows he's #1.Top song: Drop it Like it's Hot and Oh No
4,Please respect the women Snoop!!!,"Now I may be a guy and your album is really good, but seriously Snoop, please, PLEASE stop dissin' girls like that, man!!! I know you probably don't mean it, but really, tone down on the disrespect. Yo album still good though!"
5,Love,Everybody in Portugal love snoop dogg.I'm always hearing Drop it like it's hot.Snoop come to Portugal please.snoop vem a PortugalPortugal pra sp
2,Retirement?,"Disapointed...Beats are all alike and only 4-5 good songs... go buy Nas' street disciple or keep up with Th black album, college dropout or other good dcs, this one is not at all worth buying it. Drop it like its hot is the only very good song ..."
3,It's an alright study,I bought this study because some men from my church were meeting and doing it so I joined them. It is a great study but the scripture that the study goes off is the king james version so its a little tough to read and if you read the scripture in a different version some of the questions that John MacArthur asks confuse you. I gave it only three stars instead of 5 because of the king james version and alot of the reading is like three or four chapters of Acts and for somebody that is new to studying the bible like me its a little tough to follow along and answer the questions without having to constantly go back.
2,A study in Acts,I was disappointed with this study. Each lesson is just a reprint of the several chapters of Acts with very little commentary and a few questions. It is ok to use but not as stimulating as other studies our group has done.
1,Luke 1:77 refutes modern Christianity,"Just read Luke 1:77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.So in our last verse we see that God gives knowledge to Israel by remission of sins. The modern day churchcan't apply this to the rest of scripture saying that this is the start of our church; Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.So we are in the great falling away when Saved(90%) can't distinguish part of Daniels 70th week in Acts with when our age actually starts."
5,Weird and Beautiful Fairy Tale,"This movie has some very good atmospheres. It's very stylish and poetic. It is clear that their budget wasn't as great as the one for a Lynch movie, but the result is still very satisfying !I won,t elaborate on the plot but basically it's the story of a man and a woman who get lost in the woods. I have to admit I had never seen/heard dialogues used it such way. When these two talk together, you can actually see their lips are not moving at all through the whole movie.Anyways, I recomend this one very much if you're a fan of weird and interesting movies like David Lynch, amongst others."
1,Zips do not last,"I bought one of these a while ago and the zip that closes the laptop section broke after 9 months. Thinking it was a bit of bad luck, I bought another one, and the zip broke in exactly the same place in less than 6 months. Clearly the zips are not hardy enough. Dont buy this rubbish."
1,just a little disturbing,"my daughter asked for a book about baby baboons for Xmas for whatever reason and this oneseemed to work, but she's 4 1/2 and was disturbed by the image of the leopard catching the babyBaboon! Good opportunity for real life learning that wild animals are not stuffed animals! I just leftit for a few weeks and then we reread it and talked and it's all good! Just thought others might wantto know about that situation. The vervet monkey is brillant and illustrations quite lovely."
2,"Leave the word ""flea"" out of it.",Would have given it a four if it was just a comb for a double coated dog. Anything that it would catch would have to be fat. Fleas are certainly not fat. More like specks of dirt. A good hair straighten. I've been using it on my long hair because it is sturdy. Works well on dog just for grooming. Forget the fleas and lice.
4,Great fun in black and white!,"Very entertaining evenings can be spent playing this game with other classic movie buffs, or just viewing the clips. Educational and enjoyable for reminiscing. Good way to introduce young actors to the glamour of Hollywood and the talents of the early screen idols."
4,Works great.,The only downfall is is makes a sounds when I use it on my persian and then he wants to play with it. But works great.
2,not a very good comb,Not as good as my solid comb like this one but teeth don't move. My persian didn't like this comb at all. He was afraid of it.
3,A collector's item,"Yankee Loggers is one of those books that give you a bit of insight into little events in History, but don't drag you into some ""in depth"" black hole of analysis. It's written lightheartedly and leaves you with an ""I did't know that"" feeling. Originally published as a commemorative gift to Libraries by the International Paper Corporation, it's a description of the wood industry from the early settlers to the 1960's."
2,Writers' confusion,"It is not uncommon that a writer confuses simple mindedness for clarity.Laporte is an engaging speaker, would that his writing style were so as well.Still, if one can disregard the phony friendliness, the information is there."
2,NOT THE ALBUM I'VE EXPECTED FROM THEM,"For some reason, their new album didn't interest me much at all..guitars sounded soo muddy, and the drums didn't sound good. Theres a IMPORT that has a BONUS TRACK NOT AVAILABLE IN U.S. Its called ""Confession"" (which i've never heard it) Well, its a little or so so good (but not god) album."
2,Disappointing performance,"This ""new"" battery didn't perform much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced."
1,Totally waste of my time (and money!),"I was hoping some of the reviewers were wrong. At least I was hoping to get some useful samples to connect web/HTML to Oracle database. I am wrong! The whole book is repeating and repeating some concepts/subjects about HTML, database and etc. They maybe good for presentations (managers), not for real people doing the work. When I ""finally"" read the key chapter 14, Accessing Oracle databases using CGI programs on page 301, I was hoping ""this is the chapter"" that I was looking for. I was totally disappointed. No explanation of how the cgi programs ""query.exe (and others)"" connect the HTML to Oracle. Anyway, if you are just getting into web/database business, this book may give you good concepts of it. However, this book is already outdated! I am sorry to buy this book. Hoping people not repeating my mistake."
1,I feel like I've just drank a soda after eating ice cream.,"2 comments, 1 question. 1)Most of the book examines, in detail, issues that are, at best, peripherally related to building Oracle-based web sites. I learned more about visual basic than I did about PL/SQL. 2) There is a large amount of repetition in the book. The author gives a great deal of attention to why I would want to generate a database or Oracle-driven website but barely touches on how. Most people that would buy a book like this already have the desire to database-enable their website - what they need is the nuts and bolts necessary to assemble it. 3) How can you write a book about developing Oracle database-enabled websites and include NO CODE???"
1,More a light survey of methods than usable examples,"This book LIGHTLY touches on different methods of accessing databases, and mildly covers Oracle. It never even mentions Oracle new tools for Web related developement (a glaring omission in my opinion, it's what I was really hoping for given this books misleading title), it just covers generic methods for accessing databases from the web. It takes 300 pages to get to some usable code(!), and even then it's a pretty lame choice of technological solution as to how the access is done. A coulple of chapters are spent blathering on a about Oracle's SQL Administator (Why? of what use is this for this book?). Also covered is a basic primer on Oracle SQL that is also unneeded. I had high hopes for this book and was VERY disappointed. I would NOT reccomend this book to anyone."
3,"Basic Oracle A, Web Integration F","I went into this knowing nothing, but being a pretty quick study, didn't think that beginner level books were a good idea. It gave a good, thorough, beginners take on Oracle, SQL, and some other peice of cryptic software I had never heard of. Overviewed a lot of things with integration, but never seemed to finish the job. Often wondered whether the book was about Oracle Web Sites or this obscure CGI editor he keeps referring to."
2,"Very Good Story, But....","Very Good Story, but there are just a couple of problems. The First being that the story tends to be kind of choppy, but that's understandable. But the other problem is Much More Serious, at least to Me. There is a Really Really Annoying Song that the Narrator Sings in between scenes, and it makes You want to hit the MUTE Button on Your TV, and that kind of defeats the purpose of watching. You can't expect Kids to take something like this seriously, if there's going to be this song that makes them want to barf! The song is Completely Unnecessary, and could be replaced with just instrumental music if needed."
5,Creative License employed,"Great book! I read this book for a graduate fiction class, citing the examples of creative license used to make a regular work of fiction a fine example of art. I highly recommend this book"
2,This is NOT your father's VHS movie,Caveat emptor ... The DVD does NOT contain all the scenes from the original movie (I have an original VHS as well). I made in inquiry to the publisher but never received a response. Transfer is as good as can be expected but for some reason is incomplete.
3,Go Buy Blue Album,"It pains me to say this becasue Weezer is definatly top 3 in my favorite band list of all time, but this album isn't that good. Weezer becomes so much more mainstream with the release of Make Believe that most of their old fans will no longer not like this album. Weezer turns towards the more whiney emo bands, such as Jimmy Eat World, with this new CD. If thats what your into, buy this you'll like it, but if your an old fan of weezer dont bother, and if you dont own any weezer albums BUY THE BLUE ALBUM.This album attemps to ride on the success of the two singles, but neither of which are very good. The album is driven by sub-par guitar and bad rhyming. Rivers really needed to see a psychiatrist while writing this new ablum because the whole thing is depressing. Take a look at old cheery weezer before buying this new mainstream, depressed Weezer."
5,Haag55,"FANTASTIC!!! The first time I listened to this album I was floored. It reminded me of the first time I listened to Blood Sugar Sex Magic by the Chili Peppers. The songs meld together from start to finish. The guitar work is unbelieveable, with great back-up vocals and a strong vocal performance by Rivers Cuomo. This is the most creative album I have heard all year."
5,A New (and wonderful) demension to Weezer music,"I enjoy every album Weezer has ever put out, and Make Believe is no exception. The album definitely has its own unique sound, as do the four previous albums. Make believe showcases the lead vocals, sounding extremely pure and clean. There is not a lot of crazy rock stuff on this album, but there are a couple fun songs - ""Beverly Hills"", and ""We Are All On Drugs"". This is the most mature Weezer sound I've ever heard. It shows that the band members have grown and are willing to try some new things in their music. Though I am a fan of all of Weezer's previous albums, this adds a whole new dimension to a Weezer fan's collection, and also makes a great first step into the Weezer world for anyone who is not yet familiar. I love it."
4,Not so bad...,"I grew up listening to Weezer and it all started the first day I heard the imfamous 'Blue Album'. I've followed them ever since. Now a diehard fan, I never was. I saw the in a small club on the Pinkerton tour, I always wonder why they got real big with the 'Green Album', because in my opinion it's their worst. But anyway, 'Make Believe', I always get any new Weezer album the first day it comes out, though it's true nothing will ever top the Blue album, I think all their albums have something to offer. This album is fun, catchy, and better than half of the trash out there these days (although I must admit this has been a good year for CD's so far). People need to start realizing the old Weezer is old Weezer, get over it. I don't think their music took a complete 180 turn, their roots are still there. I'm liking this CD more and more each day."
2,Uninspired,"I've been a long time Weezer fan, but this album is definately the worst so far. First time I heard Beverly Hills I became skeptical about the new album. Listening to the entire album now I find most of the songs aren't very catchy, lyrics are weaker than usual, and nothing really stands out on the entire album. Definately a disappointment."
4,Weezer's comeback album?,"Hardcore and nouveau fans alike have been waiting years for Weezer's ""comeback"" album. Well folks, the wait has finally ended. No, this album might not top the Blue and Pinkerton die-hard fans' lists, but by all rights, it definitely tops green and Maladroit. This album doesn't sway too heavily either way (rock/pop); in fact, Make Believe has something for every fan. It has those catchy pop songs of blue and green, the emotion of Pinkerton, and even the crunchy riffs of Maladriot. Don't let the new single ""Beverly Hills"" throw you, the rest of album has a different feel altogether. The band's dynamics have changed over the years, and so has their music. Cuomo has said that he is trying to reach new audiences, so if you've yet to check out the band,or want to experience Cuomo's new mindset, check out Make Believe."
4,worth the wait,"This is a valiant effort from Weezer. Most people probably wouldn't think so, but if you really listen, you can hear some sublte tones and sounds that really make the songs stand out.The first 5 songs are pretty O.K. Although, I really like ""This is such a pity,"" very 80's sounding, and kinda un-weezer sounding... but good sounding.The 4 stars really go to the last 7 songs on the album. ""Pardon me"" and ""Best friend"" are probably two of the best songs weezer have ever written! I can't keep from nodding my head to these 2 songs. ""Freak me out"" is a nice smooth song, sorta comparable to ""In dreams"" from Blue. The last song, ""Haunt you every day"" is really great ballad! And is a very nice song to end on.Overall... the album is a good one. And I really do think they put some good effort into it. Kudos!"
5,Best cd - end to end - since the blue album,"All Weezer cds have had a least a few good tunes but this is the best cd, cover to cover since the blue album. It's somewhat unfair to compare every cd back to the blue album and so I've reviewed Make Believe on it's own merit. And on it's own - it's an excellent listen. If there had not been a blue album we would be calling this Weezer's breakthrough. Highly recommended."
2,Perhaps celebacy was not the answer...,"Lets face it, we've all been waiting for this album for a very long time. Frankly, the songs on this album range from mediocre to just plain bad. The lyrics show poor craftmanship,not just for Weezer, but, for any artist. The only reason it even got my 2 stars was because I love Weezer and was overjoyed at any glimps of their past glory. However, the song about being on drugs was terrible, I mean, most people could write better on drugs, I felt like I was listening to a fourth grader's lyrics. Thus, the downward spiral continues in ""Make Believe,"" its sad, but true..."
3,Middle of the road,"Until Maladroit, I never knew Rivers Cuomo was such a great guitarist. Obviously the guy can write really catchy songs, but Maladroit actually rocked and had some metal-ish guitar solos thrown in. I totally dug that, so I couldn't wait to get Make Believe.I think for the first time ever, I was actually disappointed with a Weezer album. The songs are all pretty good, but none of them really blow me away. I can get over the lack of rockin' guitar solos on this go 'round (there's none of that on this disc), but still--the songs are just kinda blah this time around."
2,phhht!,"this cd SUCKED! there was like only 2 songs i liked on it and the rest of it was just STUPID! they only sing about ""dark things and being hurt"". i mean that is just PUTHETIC! you might like this stuff if you were into the 80's but im not so PHHHT!oh! beverly hills rocks out loud though"
1,"""Beverly hills!""","Beverly hills! thats where I want to be ""have sex with me, have sex with me!"" livin in beverly hills!!!"
3,"kind of... as you Americans say ""sucks""","first off, this is going to be a bad review with not much real critical analysis. I listened to about half the CD which I got as a gift before I got bored and anoyed and shut it off. I actually liked their older CD's in all their 3 chord glory. I listened to them when I was younger and still like them to an extent. They were sort of simple but unique, 50's ish or something. Very non-intellectual, just fun, light, not very serious but a sort of unique sound. This disk seemed more commercial which almost always is a bad sign. I'm sure their making some money now but I think ulitmately this sort of commercial success quickly deflates like a woopy cushion because the fad evaporates and the core of ""true believers"" has left because they aren't progressing as musicians. Like I said though, I only listened to half the CD. I gave it 3 stars because of that and because ""it could be worse""."
1,nauseatingly bad,This album is so awful it is enough to make weezer fans give up for good. This album is so horrendous that vomiting or defecating would be the only way to express the feeling of disgust and pain when exposing one's ears to this sorry excuse for music. Please do not buy this album for god will strike you down if you do.
2,Euhh,"This wasent the best CD ever...some songs were boring, some were ok. Though most did suck so unless you want to save $$$ id just barrow the CD from a friend."
2,Definitely overrated...,"These guys can really play, but their singing is horrible and annoying. Because of that, listening to their songs is more of a CHORE than entertainment!"
2,Weezer ...Make Believe....not good,"Make Believe has a few catchy hooks, but Rivers seems to try and go a little darker on the musical and lyrical side. It doesn't work for this band. They are more of a pop band than anything.I really like the Blue, Green and Pinkerton albums. This album is definitely battling with Maladroit as Weezer's worst album. It's too bad because I really want to like it.It doesn't offer much for the listener. Maybe they should start writing songs as a band and not let Rivers have so much control."
3,Its still weezer....,"I am a true weezer fan and i own every album but yes make belive is probely the worset album yet (right next to The Greeen Album) ts still an ok album but yes i agree that the single ""Beverly Hills"" is the one of the worst songs ever made by weezer along with ""This Is Such A Pity"" also on make belive its still an alright album and is worth buying but i have to say the lyrics on this album are a little ""intrsting"" but its ok but what i still don't understand is how The Green Album got more sales than Maladroit or Pinkerton"
3,"some highlights, but not up to par with past-weezer songs","I always knew this would happen because after songs like ""Buddy Holly"" and ""Sweater Song"" I just couldn't see how much more classic u could get. There are some highlights to the album such as ""Perfect Situation"", ""We are all on drugs"", and ""This is such a pity"". and i dont know who's bright idea it was to make ""Beverley Hills"" a radio-hit. it is ANNOYING, not witty.If u have to complete ur weezer collection, get this, otherwise, buy from like a second-hand or something. this album will not last"
3,Not Bad....,"This album is a decent enough listen, until the last 3 songs which are awful and embarrassing to be caught listening to....Beverly Hills starts the album off right....there's a little interesting 80's sound on ""this is such a pity""....if you are a fan get it, but don't expect Pinkerton of course."
3,"Not fantastic, not terrible","After the scathing review Pitchfork gave this CD, and my own horrific experience with Maladroit (couldn't tolerate it) I didn't have high expectations of Make Believe. If your favourite Weezer CD is Green, well you'll probably like this one, I'm more of a Pinkerton girl myself. The CD isn't terrible, Weezer have definitely done much better, it's easy listening tolerable background music that you'll probably like or even love if you're not aware of how much better Weezer can do."
1,Weezer is dead.,"A disappointment from start to finish. You might grasp at Beverly Hills, because it resembles something you thought you liked from the green album, or maybe even Maladroit, which, in turn, resembled something you liked from Pinkerton or the blue one. Point being, Rivers & Co. have become incrementally lesser shadows of their former selves with this record. Where green and Maladraoit had a few flashes of good old Weezer to make up for clunkers like ""Crab"" and ""Take Control,"" this album has none.I held out hope, but I think I'll get back to ""Surf Wax America."""
2,Lamer and Lamer,"People need to face the fact that since Pinkerton, Weezer's albums have gotten steadily worse. I was excited to buy the new Weezer album when this came out, but was thoroughly disappointed. Counting Maladroit that makes two disappointments in a row. I don't know if I'll be buying Weezer's next album."
2,Mediocre-- skip it,"It's not horrible. Just like Chek cola isn't horrible. It's just not Coke. For a band that's had such depth and creativity (see Blue Album and Pinkerton) this is a comparatively weak effort. Most of the tracks (Peace, Pardon Me, Perfect Situation, Hold Me, etc) seem sincere and open, which is a step in the right direction, but they're overworked, dull, and a bit whiny. They just aren't catchy or interesting. Other tracks (Drugs, Beverly Hills) just seem like halfhearted, blatant attempts at hit singles. I think 'The Other Way' is the only really good song on here. I think they tried, for the most part, but Weezer seems kind of lost. Spend your dough on Pinkerton and the 2 disc version of The Blue Album, not on this."
3,Fair to Middlin',"I have been listening to this album for the last few weeks so I could really get a feel for it. It's not bad and there are a few great songs. But as I am listening to my blue album, it reminds me how different the albums are. Every single song stands out incredibly on the Blue Album, whereas in Make Believe, they all kind of mush together. I'm a little disappointed, but hopefully they will come out with something better in the future....one can hope"
1,What Went Wrong,it seems to me every album after pinkerton gets worse and worse.they used to be such a great band but now they totally suck
3,"Good, but not great.","If you're a Weezer fan you'll love this. Buy it right now. But if youre not really a fan and just heard a song like Beveryly Hills on the radio and dont really listen to much of their music, it makes less sense to buy it. As you can see people either love it or hate it. so......By the way My Best Friend is an awesome track!!!!!"
2,Oh Rivers... where have you gone?,"When you listen to Weezer nowadays, all you hear is an attempt of 80s revival good ol' rock music, not Weezer. Weezer started out great: blue, and Pinkerton. Then, something called ""The Green Album"" happened, and it all dropped short from there.""Make Believe"" is another Weezer album that drops once again in ratings, with it's deadly brothers Green and Maladroit.It seems as though bad music has taken over Rivers, and he's not the geeky alternative rocker he was back in 1994 or 1996."
1,weezer drop another stinker!,"This cd is abominable! It is simply horrendous. I don't get why anyone likes this band. If you want great rock, go for Oasis. I think they are the best thing going and are better than weezer could ever be."
1,weezer sucks,"[...]And I also hate it when a stupid kid sees a overly produced band on mtv for only 3min., and 3 min. later says they're awesome, and doesn't bother to know their backgrounds or discography.(such bands include greenday, weezer, the presidents of the united states, etc.) If u want some better bands to listen to, well here they are: the failure, poorsport, mr.trout, mad parade, the matches, the weirdos, hotdogs, celldweller, snfu, no alternative, the swellers, the jackalopes, treephort, phinehas, so many dynamos, cursive, and of course, calabrese."
4,Awesome Album.,"This is definitely a great album. I'd say it has some Pinkerton type music on it. Rivers finally gets in touch with his emotions again on this album, and he always makes the best music when he does that. My favorite songs are ""Perfect Situation"", ""The Damage In Your Heart"", there's no point of listing them all. I like pretty much all of them. I definitely recommend picking up this album if your a Weezer fan. Definitely there best album since Pinkerton, and it's been long awaited."
2,"I like two songs on ""Make ""Believe""","I bought this and ""Maladriot"" together for my first Weezer albums. I like ""Maladriot"" a lot, but don't like ""Make Believe."" It's too lite and commercial sounding. The only songs I like are ""Beverly Hills,"" and ""Perfect Situation."""
2,What Happened Rivers?,"Things seem to start off well, Beverly Hills and Perfect Situation are great songs, then after that, things start heading downhill. The songs quickly get boring, and the lyrics get even more juvenile. I loved their first 2 CDs, but they've been on a steady decline ever since. I'm afraid that I'm losing interest in the band, and that's a shame, because they could have been a contender."
3,Middle of the Road Weezer,"Here's how I rank my Weezer albums...1. Blue album2. Pinkterton3. Maladroit4. Make Believe5. Green albumAfter a three year hiatus, and literally HUNDREDS of demos to choose from, this is the album they came up with. Something very safe and very familiar. To me it just feels a little unauthentic.Nevertheless, it's still Weezer, and it's still better than 90% of the stuff out there today..."
1,Poor excuse,"Another disappointment from weezer. Generic, boring guitar-rock that blends in with the masses of MTV bands weezer used to rise above. Gone is all the wittiness and intelligence of the weezer of yore, only to be replaced with vapid middle-schooler poetry and overproduced power chord wankery. Better than maladroit in some ways and worse than others. If you loved weezer's last two releases, you'll probably love this, too. But if you have half-decent taste, you'll avoid it like the plague."
3,It's okay,"Weezer fans either fall into Pinkerton era fans or Green era fans. I think that Green is one of the most perfect albums ever created. Now that you know where I'm coming from, Make Believe doesn't deliver much Green power. Letting go of that bias, I think this is an okay, but not great, album.Positive points:1) It has a bunch of slightly humorous jokes in it like ""we are all on drugs.""2) It has some sonically interesting moments making use of lots of overtones and thick harmonic textures that are sometimes quite cool.Negative points:1) The songs just aren't that interesting. Meaning the lyrics don't connect with me and the music doesn't excite me. If you are looking for killer riffs you'll be disappointed.2) The songs go on too long, I'd guess an average of 3:45 each. Some of these songs could've been great if they were sped up and shortened."
1,What a failure,"Easily the worst Weezer album. I'm a big fan of the blue album, and Pinkerton was wonderful. The Green album and Maladroit were lesser albums, but still had at least 3-4 good songs on them. But this album is just terrible. The lyrics are howlingly bad - simple, stupid and childish. The lyrics on the past albums weren't Shakespeare, but at least the music distracted you. This time, the songs are bland, and the melody is lacking. I would be embarassed to play any of these songs out loud, or for someone to see this album in my collection. Don't waste your money. And don't listen to the babbling fanatics - this album is terrible."
5,Weezer is a Pleezer!!!!,"I think Weezer has definitely forged new ground with this cd. They've entered an age where they were able to diversify their music, yet keep a firm grip on their sound. I like the fact that there are ballads that have real soul and feelings. Also, some of the songs have an 80's feel, while Beverly Hills has a current rock sound with an interlude of 60's guitar rock. My favorite song on the album is Perfect Situation. I think it is brilliant and by far one of my favorite Weezer songs of all time. You are really missing out if you have not already bought this album. Weezer is definitely a Crowd Pleezer!!!!!"
4,Not The Best Weezer Record But Still Good,"This album is an improvement over Maladroit, but still isn't the best they have put out. Beverly Hills and Perfect Situation are the best songs on the album, but others are pretty good. I have been a Weezer fan for years and I can say that this isn't their best, but it isn't their worst. On the plus side, their sound has really matured. I recommend this record, but mainly to Weezer fans only. I don't think this album will win any fans, but it will satisfy the older ones.The best record to start with is ""The Blue Album""."
3,3.5 stars... still no pinkerton,"Ok, I've read how Rivers really changed his style up for this record and it is better than the inferior maladroit and green, but I still feel like Rivers's songwriting isn't what it once was. Pinkerton and Blue remain the best albums theyve made and I'd recommend those to first time listeners to really get the true Weezer style of rock. Green, Maladroit, and Make Believe all seem too poppy, almost begging you to buy them.There are a few good tracks. My favorite is ""This is such a pity"". However, the lyrics are not up to par with Pinkerton and Blue. In fact, they're downright cheesy at times. The music is good though. Even if Rivers seemingly writes the lyrics too quickly and with little thought (I read he cranks out a song a day usually), he remains a much better songwriter than 99% of everything else out there on the radio today.Overall: Decent and worth a listen... but no Pinkerton."
3,Okay,"I would say this is probably the worst Weezer Album out...It seemed to be lacking all of weezer's originality and creativity? It really suprised me and disappointed me when I heard the CD for the first time...what happened to Weezer? Its an okay CD, fun to listen to sometimes but stick with their older stuff...its alot better. Beverly Hills...what is that? I can't believe they would make a song with that sort of meaning behind it!? But yea..I really like Weezer so I hope they won't fall apart"
2,What happend?,"I'd really like to get my Weez on but it ain't gonna happen with this new album. Aside from Pinkerton I've been a HUGE fan of Weezer. I was really looking forward to this album and I couldn't be more disapointed. The lyrics are so cheesy they sound like they were written by Rivers 13 year old sister. ""We're all on drugs"" sounds like it has to be a joke but it's not funnyl. Beverly Hills is the strongest track on this CD. I'm really a little confused as to why they put this out. Maybe this cheese is good for your average 13 year old but I'm the same age as the guys in the band and I wish I'd downloaded it for free instead of wasting my money."
3,umm... what is this?,"There are maybe 2 and a half good songs on this album.I mean, it's not horrible, and it's listenable, but their earlier studio albums were much better. I think Weezer kinda died a little with this CD. This is not rock anymore... it's pop-rock. There are a couple songs with interesting lyrics and rythem, but most of it is just the same over and over again, with no realy meaning. It's an okay buy if you love weezer, but still...PEACE and LOVE"
1,lets make believe this cd didn't suck,"*sigh* i knew it was coming when i heard beverly hills for the first time and good god no, not the last, i heard that same song every single time i stepped into my car!!!! every time! and i needed to change the radio station every time it came on and yes, half way thru the first time hearing it i was sick of it! it is so phony so non musical it really does not live up to the wonderful and creative work that weezer has been producing for their last 4 cds. although every other song completely sucked perfect situation was ok but it would have been better if they stuck it on one of their previous cds. but make believe really doesn't cut it. it really is not at all good and i LOVED every other weezer album. really weezer - step up to the plate!!!"
2,"Not great, not horrible.","Personally, when I look at a band that has multiple albums, I expect to see some variation and some evolution. This album is exactly the opposite of evolution. It's the same as maladroit or green. Not as 'poppy' as green. However, there is nothing special about this. The lyrics are pathetic for a 30 year old. Musically, the full disc is the exact same monotonous music. Basically, if you listened to green or maladroit, you are getting more of the same with this album. There has been no evolution in this band and that is depressing. If this album wasn't their fifth, I might give it a better score. However, considering that this is their fifth album and that the band has neglected to show any change or evolution or progression, I have to give this a generous 2."
1,To sum up something interesting I heard once...,"...someone said ""I can't stand listening to Pinkerton or any of Weezer's albums anymore; Make Believe killed all Weezer for me :(""So, yeah, Weezer has pretty much lost all ""edge"" and made a very annoying pop album. If you are new to listening to Weezer, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM, get the Blue Album, Green Album, or Maladroit instead."
2,Weezer Sold Out With This Album,"I bought this album, like many people this year who were looking for decent music in todays bad times for rock, along with Foo Fighters 'In Your Honor' and Beck's 'Guero'. Of the 3 CD's I purhcased that day, this is by far my least favorite. Very dissapointing. I am a fan of Weezer's old stuff, and the single ""Beverley Hills"" was good, which made me think the album would be, but guess what? The album turned out to be a boring, sophmoric emo album, something I would never buy if I had not had previous respect for this band. I like ""Beverley Hills"", ""This Is Such A Pity"", and ""We Are All On Drugs"" (""Your My Best Friend"", for some reason, has also started to grow on me). Other than the aforementioned songs this album is sophmoric emo crap. I believe I will sell it."
4,"top notch, better than the last two","Weezer explored a lot of new things with this album, it's not all just the simple poppy pop-o-matic pop that previous albums have been. Songs like ""Freak Me Out"" and ""This is Such A Pity"" dive in to areas that they haven't really gone to before. ""This is such a pity"" is a song that could have been written in 1985 and ""Freak me out"" , my personal favorite, reminds me of something Deathcab might have written. Other songs like ""Perfect Situation"", and ""Hold Me"" are classic weezer songs. Although there are some songs that could have been left off the album in my opinion, it is definitely much better than the previous two."
2,Make Belive... that this is a good album...,"Granted, Blue Album, Pinkerton, Green Album (although a little too poppy and generic), and most of Maladroit are some of my favorite, and the best albums ever made, however Make Believe fails to strike a chord in my heart. Basically this album's songs just don't match up to the old ones and are maybe, so to speak, too crooneresque? Weezer needs the heavy guitar (Tired of Sex) to really come out, not speaking the same cliche phrase over and over again (Beverly Hills, the epitome of horrible).Since it's Weezer, I cannot give them 1 star, they're just too amazing. I will definitly see the Make Belive tour, just to hear the old stuff, however I do not recommend Make Believe"
2,Weezer NOOOOO!!!,"Every song on this album follows a formula: soft verse followed by a slow and sappy chorus. It sounds distinctly Weezer, but this time it isn't very good. You can see everything coming from a mile away.. I pretty much knew what ""Hold Me"" sounded like within the first 30 seconds. They also have the obligatory slow ballad closer ""Dece"".. er, ""Only in Dr"".. sorry, ""Haunt You Every Day"".There are three good songs on here: ""Beverly Hills"" is classic Weezer in the vein of ""El Scorcho"", ""Peace"" has some great little guitar melodies, and ""Freak Me Out"" is a really amusing tune with a riff similar to the ""Sweater Song"". That's about it.I was really disappointed with this one. It sounds like they had a bunch of leftover ballads from their other albums and slapped them all on here. Has Weezer lost it? Say it Aint So!"
4,Good Album... an individual album,"I think that this album has a lot of potential to becoming one of weezers better albums. I do not like it how many people desperately cling on to the hopes of another blue or pinkerton... as with any band, they are making different sounds and noises now. It is merely time to focus on these new noises. That said, there are several things i like about this album. It has somewhat of a ""back to the 80s"" theme to it on some songs, with some power pop piano riffs in the back. One thing i did not like about the album was We Are All on Drugs and Beverely Hills strange displacement to the rest of the album. Overall however, i liked it quite a bit, and would definetely reccomend it."
2,too many typos,There are so many typos and errors in the book that I can no longer trust anything I look up in this book. I thought it deserved two stars just for the price.
4,A Few Thoughts on a Tragedy,"Every family has to deal with periods of love, hate, and loss, but not often is it as overwhelming for families as it was for the Hill family of Garrard County. This was truly an amazing story of what families WILL overcome when necessary. The fact that it was based on a true story makes it makes it even more appealing. I think everyone should read this book. It will make you think about how much courage and stamina you might show in situations. As a descendant of the Hill family, I am proud to think that I might have some of Mary's determination and family pride and love. Read the book!!"
2,"Had potential, but...","I liked the premise of this book. Feuds and such have always intrigued me. However, despite the interesting storyline, the writing was laughably bad. Stilted dialogue and uninteresting paragraphs on things that have nothing to do with the story abound! Seriously, who cares about the churning of the butter? And who talks like these people? Nobody I know, that's for sure. I will give the author two stars for research, but that's about as courteous I can be, especially considering the writing was very cringe-worthy in more than one place. I don't have the book handy right now, but there was a part where a character said, ""Come hear"" instead of ""Come here"" as if should have been. After reading that, I failed to take this author seriously at all, but again, the premise was nice. It just needed some editing."
4,Delightful boy,Over all this book is charming. The pen drawings really make the book. Rupert (aka Sprout) looks exactly like my son. I can't quite give this book a perfect 10 because Sprout's parents seem a little harsh. They don't delight in their son even though he seems like a delighful child.
1,Best 80MM fan you can find on Amazon? give me a break...,"I really wanted to order a Fan from Amazon.com, because they have such a nice selection on most products. I was suprised that Amazon didn't carry any other brand name Fans from companies like CoolerMaster, Thermaltake, etc., the FANS are on the noisy side compared to other brand name fans. I also thought there were LED lights on these fans, but don't be fooled they are just clear, boring, and very noisy fans...another minus for antech...:(...hope i can return these or i have to end up suffering to extreme headaches from vibrations and noise..."
5,A superb anthology of an outstanding Black poet.,"Raymond Nelson edits Harlem Gallery And Other Poems Of Melvin B. Tolson (1865-0), which presents works from one of the most recognized black voices in American poetry. His poems are here organized by topic and include notes for further study."
5,Bob's review of Melvin Tolson's Book of Poems,"He was a professor at an all black college and the movie ""The Great Debaters"" was about him and his students.Excellent movie and his book is also an interesting read.Bob"
4,Great for the kids-3,Another great video for teaching Bible stories to your kids and grandkids. I can highly recommend it to parents and grandparents for this reason.
2,bible story: samson and delilah,its ok. not that bad for the price. but i wish they could make a better animation...
5,Out Standing!!!,One word: wow. This is an amazing tool for the beginners. This has helped me so much and I reccomend this product to everyone who wants to learn how to program!
5,Dakota Sportsman Grille Guard,"Fits great, installed in a matter of minutes. Good quality piece, a lot nicer than some of that other thin cheesy junk out there."
5,An enchantment,"I like very very much this story.Inary Cameron flees, she is afraid of the voices in the night...if you like witches, curses, danger and love, find this book and enjoy ! I also like FOREST OF THE NIGHT, BENEATH THE SURFACE and BURNING TIMES by EVELYN VAUGHN"
5,Cook Book,Book arrived promptly and was in excellent condition. I am very pleased with this transaction.
4,Great for children,I bought this DVD for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it. The characters are over cute and the dialogue is a bit syrupy but she loves the trouble Sugar causes to Sagas life.
1,snow fairy sugar,"This is the most annoying thing that i have ever watched, its really not worth buying, i would rather watch pokemon over and over again and over again."
2,I didn't like it,"I have been looking for a good, organic tea but I just did not like the taste of this one. It feels like it leaves a film in your mouth."
1,Worst Green Tea Ever,"This is the worst green tea I have ever had. Don't be fooled by the pristine picture on the packaging. This tea is made in China--I doubt where this tea is grown looks anything like the picture. I try not to buy food products from China considering how polluted it is. This may be ""organic"" but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad."
4,Good Green Tea,"Tastes good and good for you too, This was my first time using this product and now I'm hooked.I like it."
1,maybe next time.,This book was definitely not what I thought it was going to be.It was poorly written . It was a bunch of non-connecting ideas put together. I'm very disappointed.
5,Couldn't Get Enough,"The story moved well and kept my interest. I kept turning the pages until there was no more to turn. I laughed, rejoiced and cried. Highly recommended."
3,its okay,"kinda overpowering so i dont use it much, and a little goes a long way. probably wont order again because there is an outstanding taste to it that im not too fond of"
1,awful...just awful!!!,We love Bible films. This though is awful. The drawings are poor. There is an annoying boy who is supposed to be narrating the story. Every once in a while he breaks out into some horrible catterwailing that is I suppose singing by someone's standard. It's so bad it hurts. He has a horrible voice. Even the lyrics were often awful.Please don't waste your money on this it's dreadful!
2,Cheap animation,"I agree with a previous reviewer, the animation on this is horrible. It's like they didn't even try to make their characters look decent. I really hate that everyone who does kids' movies thinks they need to throw in songs, especially when the music is as shoddy as the animation. The story and dialogue itself isn't bad. The cover art is deceptive, making it look a whole lot better than it is; they took more time with their contours, coloring and shading. You'd think that it would be a better quality with Charleton Heston presenting it."
3,decent,"It's not as good as ""shots"" which is the album that comes after this one (I think). But, unlike most early albums, it's recorded well and the production is good. It is a good, just low key. It's a ""slower"" album. some people might like it more."
5,Scrumptulescent tuna!,"This tuna is simply marvelous. Not unlike a romantic retreat in the Serengheti with a voluptuous lover, this tuna will tentalize you and make you reassess your past preconceptions of what ""smashing!"" really means. The delicate olive oil blends with the creamy, buttery, proteiny tuna to create a climax of gastronomic nutting that will make you want to smoke a cigarette next to the empty can as soon as you're done with the ingestion. The olive oil and the tuna complement each other unlike any pair of anything in the universe ever. Laurel and Hardy, Tom and Jerry, Peanut Butter and Jelly, Sonny and Cher all pale in comparison to olive oil and tuna. I'm pretty sure that when the yin and yang was created, it was originally pink and light green to symbolize this gastronomic union. I eat this for breakfast, with my cereal; for lunch, with other tuna, and for dinner, with steak.But seriously. It's really good. Buy it."
1,Genova Tuna Fish,"I had purchased 48 3 oz. cans of tuna, upon opening some of the tuna I had to throw out 20 cans, because the product was spoiled (dark meat and fowl smell). I purchased this product in the past with no problems."
4,My wife has used it for a long time,"She wanted a clean, subtle perfume and has not found another that she enjoys as much. She wants to stay away from the fragrances that arrive 10 minutes before she does!"
1,Absurd,"This is the worst Mountaineers book I own. The information inside is completely outdated and useless. It concentrates on gear for 3/4 of the book (outdated gear) and gives little useful information. If you are looking for a book on the history of snowshoes, look no further. If you are looking for useful information try elsewhere. I'm usually too lazy to review most books, but this was just that horrible."
4,Well written,"This well written book covers snowshoeing in depth (techniques, shoe and binding options, racing, history, and more) and related topics (winter camping, snow shelters, winter clothing, winter safety, winter route finding, and more). An experienced winter camper or snowshoer won't find too much that is new, but will no doubt get some fresh ideas from reading this book. For someone new to snowshoeing and winter camping, the book is recommended."
4,godd review of snowshoeing,"This was a good review of the history of snowshoeing, types of shoes, why you might want to pick one type over another. Gives you a feeling that you are living out the increasing popularity of the sport and technologic advancements in types of shoes and gear. Compares climate, snow conditions, terrain in various parts of the country. Good tips on preparedness for being outdoors in various conditions."
4,Recipes just like mom made.,This is an excellent book of traditional Italian recipes. I bought the book over 25 years ago. It is a softcover book so it needed to be replaced from years of use. I wish there was a hardcover edition with more recipes. I use it all the time.
3,Not spectacular,"I purchased this CD because the original Friends Soundtrack is superb. I really enjoyed that so I was anticipating this. Now, I can't say the CD is horrible, but it's nothing like the other Friends Soundtrack. It has cute little clips from the TV show in between songs, which is kind of a neat idea. And, like almost everyone else these days, I liked Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) ""Smelly Cat."" But, in the version on this record, they have Phoebe singing back-up and doesn't get the spotlight, which isn't fair because she MADE ""Smelly Cat!"" Ah well, it's not as bad as some of the songs on here. A number of the songs aren't up to potential. Well, none of them are really bad, but a only a few are really good. ""Delicious"" is somewhat catchy, but I think your money would much better be spent by buying the original ""Friends Soundtack."" But if you kinda like Friends memoribilia, this would be a nice piece to your collection, really."
3,Not as good as the original Friends soundtrack,"This CD is not nearly as good as the original, but as a real ""Friends"" fan, I decided to pick it up. The quotes are excellent, and a few of the songs aren't COMPLETELY terrible. I'm not sure how many of the songs were actually used in the show, although I'm certain that the used ""Trouble with Boys"" in the New Year's Rockin' Eve episode. Others may have been used as background music in party scenes, much like the songs on the first soundtrack were used. But the final song, ""Friend 'Til The End (I'll Be There For You)"" by Thor-El was absolutely terrible, and the Smelly Cat re-mix was overlong and annoying. In general the songs are bland adult-pop, probably the sort of music that the characters would listen to. Unless you want to prove you're a true fan of the show, you might as well skip it and just download audio clips from a peer-to-peer site, or buy the DVDs that are being released now."
3,Friends Fans Only!!,"I bought this sounsdtrack b/c I am a devout Friends fan. But it wasnt all that terrific and I hate saying that about anything that has to do with that show!!! So if you arent a die hard fan, I would pass.....otherwise, click and buy!!!"
2,Erm...,"Like the first one, I fail to see why this is a Friends soundtrack. The only song I remember here is Smelly Cat. The last song is ridiculous and the rest of the CD isn't great.And why is the U2 song 'With Or Without You' not on here either?The best song used in the show and they have it on neither CD.It's a shame that the best programme ever had such poor soundtracks made from it."
3,STILL FRIENDS FOREVER,"I JUST WANNA SAY THAT THIS IS A VERY NICE SOUNDTRACK AND THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BUY IT BECAUSE SOME PARTS ARE REALLY WORTH IT.WELL FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO COMPLAIN IN THE HARDEST POSSIBLE WAY FOR PUTTING THAT HORRIBLE SINGER FOR -SMELLY CAT- I MEAN WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT, SHE LIKE HASN'T SUNG EVER OR WHAT WAS IT? MEANWHILE, WHAT I FOUND MOST AMAZING ABOUT THIS ALBUM WERE THE CLIPS THAT INCLUDED REALLY MEMORABLE MOMENTS FOR US FROM THE SHOW. BUT ALL THE SONG ARE SO NOT RELATED TO IT. DID ANYBODY REALISE THAT U2's -WITH OR WITHOUT YOU- WAS MISSING, THAT IS THE CRIUCIAL SONG OF THE SHOW.AND NOW LAST BUT NOT LEAST I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE <<FRIENDS>> FOR GIVING ME THE BEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE THROUGHOUT THIS 5 YEARS.THANK YOU RACH, MON, PHOEBS, JOEY, CHANDLER AND ROSS YOU ARE MY LIFE. THANK YOU GUYS & KEEP IT UP!"
3,the green day song rox!!!!!!!!!,well i av 2 say the green day song on this album ttly rox....(thats the billie joe armstrong 1)nd thats all i av 2 say but i only bought this 4 that song nd im glad i did!!!!!!!!!!
5,showing you the money,"chiang captures an economic system in these pages, sure it will be shelved with travel or cycling books, but the real insight is her rollicking sometimes obsessive look at what money means to ordinary folks. this is truth rarely told. finance looms large in relationships between intimates, neighbors and co-workers. chiang pulls out her wallet and gives us a chance to see both cuba and ourselves."
4,A thinking book,"This is not a travel book about Cuba. It is not a book about solo cycling. It is not a book about the adventures of a single woman in a strange country. It is not a book about how to make do with less.It IS a book about all of the above, and so much more! It IS a book about the realities of life in today's world of unreality. It IS a book to be understood as much as enjoyed. In a time of fast-forward, it is a book to make you pause and think. It's hard to ask more from so few words."
5,Entertaining and insightful,This travel tale about a diminutive gal on a small wheeled folding bike in Cuba hits a home run. Lynette's brutally honest account of her feelings and course of action taken during this trek is wonderful reading. This story is something which I believe many people dream of yet few actually do. Myself included.
5,Personality Plus,"I recently rode my Bike Friday with Lynette and some 40 other ""Friday"" enthusiasts through the historic towns of Southern Arizona, so I was pleased to find that the personality that exudes from her every pore was clearly revealed in this entertaining, funny, bittersweet, educational account of her biking through Cuba. I can't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours (whether or not you like biking and travel) than to view Cuban everyday life through Lynette's perceptive and objective eyes. The only thing better would be to actually take a bike ride with Lynette."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Picked up this book because the title was so catchy and WAS NOT ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN. It was a great read with a very honest insight into a world that is miles away from the one I live in. Looking forward to your next book, by the way when will it be?"
4,"Different, fun, revealing.","This book was fun to read as well as revealing from several perspectives: first it offered an intimate look at Cuba from an unbiased observer. Ms. Chiang takes pains to remain objective and not take sides. This is a welcome change from the politically charged perspectives we have from Cuban expatriates and the Cuban government.Secondly, the book provided an interesting insight into how Ms. Chiang was personally affected by this journey. It left me wanting to know more about this person who was willing to leave her job and her home to travel around the world on her folding bike.An easy and yet thought-provoking read."
4,Great travel book,"An excellent book and very observant of the 'small things' that Lynette sees as she cycles around this marvellously eccentric and somewhat surreal island. The author meets and greets a lot of different people, with something to say about them all, and goes through some hair-raising experiences too. The end result is an entertaining and amusing read. Very reminiscent of my own bike-borne tour too!"
5,Great Read with none of the Lonely Planet attitude!,"I just received this book, and I couldn't put it down. This is the best travel journal I've read, and I've read a lot of them (I also liked, Off the Map: Bicycling Across Siberia, which is out of print). Lynette is an amazing writer, with none of the Lonely Planet attitude. She chucked her comfortable job in Australia and set off on her Bike Friday to see the world. An especially good read for Americans, who are unable to visit Cuba, thanks to the insane U.S. embargo, and the large number of Florida electoral votes. Sadly, Lynette is not a coffee drinker (see http://bicyclecoffeesystems.com)."
3,Lacking,"Great idea for a book and very well written however i felt it became a little too repetitive mid way through the book. She meets a Cuban family to stay with the night, they are welcoming, she tips them, she meets another family, stays with them, tips them, and she meets another....you get my drift."
2,"Fair, good for price.","Not very impressed with these shoes, not nearly as much as other Nunn Bush products. I found them quite stiff out of the box, and the leather too firm. After several months of occaisional wear they had not loosened up, rather, the leather had developed uncomfortable and unsightly creases. Granted, these are inexpensive shoes, and I bought them for rainy days when I did not want to wear my more expensive black dress shoes.I still have them, wear them occaisionally when the weather is bad, but will be looking for another foul-weather pinch-hitter when these either wear out or I have some money to spend."
1,A Disappointment,"This video is titled ""Apostles""... but there are only 2 of the 12 even mentioned in the program. I am very disappointed in it, and it does nothing to further the teaching of our young children about the calling of the first Apostles who learned the Faith directly from Jesus."
3,Man...?,"The first time sixteen-year-old Cass Kohlmann saw Michael O'Shea, she knew her heart was lost. Handsome and humorous, he could make any girl believe in legends - if only for a day. Ten years later, Cass still dreamed of Michael, though her practical older mind was convinced her enchanting man had been mere imagination.Or myth...?Michael had waited years for the lovely Cass's return. And with the chance finally at hand, he was eager to make his move. But first, he had to make Cass believe - in magic and in him. For Michael knew that only the love of this special woman could make him real...."
1,"Useless- broke easily, not balanced, wouldn't work","This was a gift for someone who had always wanted a wave machine. We were both so disappointed, and I regret spending any money on this item- complete waste! The pivot point broke off, unit was not balanced and would not move, useless. Worst present I have ever given anyone."
5,Lupin the third a masterpiece to be watched,"Lupin the Third is the worlds most notorious gentleman thief along with his three cohorts Daisuke Jigen,Goemon Ishikawa,and the lovely Fujiko Mine Lupin travels the world stealing the worlds greatest treasures just think of him as the father of Carmen Sandiego. Lupin steals from anywhere and anything all while being pursued by inspector Zenigata of Interpol. With a charm and wit that makes James Bond look like a amature. It is a rather funny cartoon I was greatly impressed when I saw an episode on Adult Swim and I was hooked. This is pretty good considering it was done in the late 1960's. It is fun to see Lupin go around and steal things you wouldn't believe, with great one liners and a jazzy soundtrack to fit it nicely. It will surely steal your heart and not all the money in your wallet."
5,A great collection from Dayton Ohio's preZapp Prodigies,"Novices to the funk music scene, take note. Purchase this and the CD ""Ohio Players Gold"" in lieu of the double CD ""Funk on Fire"" (Which is not bad, just, more or less, has OP at their peak and declining years) and get all you need to know about phunkay sounds. Granted, they bit a little morsel or two from James Brown, Parliament, Sly, but hey! What 70's funk band didn't, I ask you? This collection has the early Junie Morrison influenced cuts, ""Pain"", ""Pleasure"", ""Esctacy"", and the hard to find cuts ""Funky Worm"" and ""Varee is Love""--a last dance cut at many a blue-lighted basement house party. Plus, it boasts a cover with OP's famous bald model--the one who was apparently the fantasy of many a school boy crush...the Mercury Records album models were ok--especially for ""Honey""--but they just weren't like this bald one. Anyway, get it from Amazon.com, now, and have fun with those great sounds and great cover!"
4,Original Funk,"This collection is essential for the critical funk fan. The music associated with the Westbound years (can you imagine having The Ohio Players & Funkadelic on the same label). ""Pain"", ""Ecstasy"",""Funky Worm"","" Varee is Love"" & ""Walt's First Trip"". Funky beyond compare. The departure of Junie Morrison is evident in their later work ( he was so funky).The Players are always superb."
5,First person to review but not the first to love Christina!,"Christina Aguilera is great! She is, in my opinion, the best new artist of 1999. I'm sure many people agree with me. I hope that Christina gets the credit she deserves for such great songs as this."
3,Just OK,"I am a huge fan of Jude's. However, this book rambled along. If your looking for humor like you are used to seeing in her older books, you won't find much of it in this one. The supporting characters weren't very supporting with the exception of the leading man (not men). This book is worthwhile to check out from the library though."
2,Poor Impression,"I am usually a great fan of Jude Deveraux's novels, but this one was a major disappointment. It is a mystery, and I don't think mystery writing is Ms. Deveraux's forte. Too many loose ends, criminals that appeared out of nowhere, and unsatisfactory resolutions for a couple of the main characters made this book a most unsatisfying read. I think Ms. Deveraux is ordinarily a wonderful author, but I suggest she stick with historical or modern romance, straight up or with a little occult tossed in. This book was in the vein of her previous novel ""High Tide"", which was also terrible."
2,A hard time staying focused,"Overall,I thought the premise of the story showed promise. What I found, after forcing my way through reading, was that the plot is not up to Jude's normal standards. The theme seems to drag and it's hard to stay intereseted when the plot changes so very much and so drastically every five pages. I also found he lack of romance a bit disappointing. It really didn't feel like there was enough of the charecters interactions to understand them. It's definitely not her useual style. Her romance writing style is what I like so much about herbooks, and I saw none of it at all."
3,Not the typical Deveraux,This book is written in a far different style than the typical Deveraux books. There heroine is torn between 2 men for much of the book and the mystery surrounding her was the true focus rather than the romance. It's a fun read but it lacks the passion typical of a Deveraux historical romance.
1,What happened?,"It's a shame that some of these established romance novelists began to think that they could change the format of their books and still sell millions of copies based solely on their names. Jude Devereaux is one who's last few books have been so engrossed in their lack-luster story lines, that she forgot to create any kind of chemistry between her characters. This book is no exception. The physical description of the characters has been paired down so that you're left to imagine that they might be attractive. And these two characters were so flat and uninteresting, you really didn't care if they got together in the end.I suggest checking out her older books, like the Velvet series or A Knight In Shining Armor."
2,Not Up To Her Usual Standards,"What has happened to Jude Deveraux? She used to write wonderful stories of romance, but is now venturing into the paranormal, and now into romantic suspense. She should go back to what she does better....think Knight in Shining Armor, and Remembrance.I didn't even finish the book, because I literally didn't care what happened to the characters, so I can't tell you plot details.This wouldn't be bad as a book to read at the beach, because you wouldn't care if you dropped it in the ocean. But if you are busy, like me, skip it."
5,couldn't put it down,"I really enjoyed the story, it was entertaining and I wouldrecommend it. I also hope that there is a little bit of truthin that fiction book and that catnip does get rid of japenesebeetles. I'll have to test it next spring and keep my fingerscrossed. Good job Jude can hardly wait for the next one."
2,What you see is not what you get,Lable has changed as well as the product. I had a jar of this stuff and it worked great. I purchased this and lable is different as well as the material. It didnt clean like the old stuff. Sorry your jar will not look anything like the picture.
3,Not a Bad Amp,"I had bought this amp because i really didn't want much bass in my ear but since i got a bigger amp at a steal of a deal, i now use this boss amp for pushing my midrange speakers and it is performing quite well"
5,Vintage and memorable performance,"Performed in 1957 in Hyde Park,London, this music, recorded live at a special Queens Birthday parade,is unique and remarkable. It includes a powerful 21 Gun Salute accompanying an arrangement of ""Happy Birthday"" among other delights among which The Post Horn Galop is an impressive trumpet solo. The second part of this disc is a band concert program which includes twenty or so traditional British melodies rarely heard together. There are excellent notes with this very special collection."
1,This was bad...,"I agree the another reviewer - the 5 star ratings have to be fake. I enjoy camp as much as anyone (Plan 9, Lost Skeleton, etc), and I want to support small film-makers, but this just sucked overall. No effects of note, no jokes of note. I finished up the movie thinking ""why did they bother?"""
2,I stupidly ignored negative reviews,"I bought this, thinking the trailers for this movie were funny. Big mistake. While it does have a nice element of office humor, it's a one note plot, taking place almost entirely as a few people run between cubicles away from very slow moving zombies. Perhaps the writers could have mixed things up a bit by having them trapped in an elevator or crawling through ventilation. But then again, that might have cost more than the budget allowed. Perhaps the biggest sin is supposedly ""eaten"" people showed up later as zombies without an ounce of blood on their clothes. In fact, i'm not sure i saw any blood at all (or bite marks), which makes this a toothless zombie movie. On the plus side, the actors were appealing, but they didn't have much to work with."
4,Fun to see zombies in an office,"A fun picture destined to be a cult favorite. Office of the Dead is about a software engineer who works on a big project and then turns his office into zombies. The story is light, the acting solid, and although there were some parts where you have to turn up the volume, it was still a good time and great for an indie. The Indie Movie Reviewer gives a thumbs up."
4,"Safe, quick, secure",Used this to keep my bed/dinette up against the wall in my Toy Hauler (RV). The road vibrations used to cause the bed to fall down with a standard eye/hook on rough roads. The added latch kepts the hook from popping out when going down the road.
3,better books? sure! mediocre photographer? nonsense!,"Are there better photography books on this subject?Sure.....Alain Cheneviere's book is supurb, one need go no further....but the other reviewer's snide comment that Art Wolfe is a mediocre photograher at best is beyond absurd and beneath contempt....I can only attribute such nonsense to professional jealousy and/or a boatload of misplaced hubris....Wolfe is a marvelous photographer; his work in the natural world often captures both the moment and the essence of his subjects in priceless portraits; check out some of his other efforts for confirmation....best......."
3,An average buyer,"I've visited the himalayas and wanted to buy a book capaturing the beauty. While there is no question that the photos in this book have their own beauty, I found many of the pictures somewhat dull in colors, not very vivid. Many are in low light or cloudy conditions. While I'm sure some may like the book, I also believe there are other books that may satisfy the average person more. I bought this book after seeing a different book at a local store with immensely beautiful pictures of the Himalayas, but this book didn't do it for me. My advice is to check out the book at a local bookstore before buying to determine if it satisfies your taste."
1,It's a shame,"This book represents how far we've dropped visually as a culture. Especially when there exists books out there, self published, like David Robbins ""Himalayan Odyssey"" that capture true insight into the Tibetan culture over a long, rigourous time and method. Instead, we're once again merely given more of the same pretty landscapes and fuzzy warm children that any passing tourist with a good working knowledge of their camera could do. Art is (was?) a wonderful person, I'm sure, though a mediocre photographer at best. Check out David's book for the real deal. I am a published photographer myself, albeit in a totally different genre."
3,"Yes, the war is still hell.","I saw this movie and even it's made without Hollywoodspecial effects, it's dicent and touchy, you feel forthis soldiers, because not like in other countries military service in Israel is an obligation and the troops are not paid good money, like in our country.Still they did go and suffered a lot just to stay alive.You can try to support free palestine, and feel bad for the soldiers also, but do not take my words and watch for your self."
1,"I never knew there was a boring war movie, but Gitai did it","I was looking forward to an interesting movie about the Yom Kippur war, and I mean interesting and not necessarily a thriller with lots of blood. This movie managed to be utterly boring. There is no story line, no climax, you learn nothing about the Yom Kippur war, its context or anything relating to it, and not really anything about the characters either. The shots are endless, especially of the same tracks and the same tanks again and again and the same injured soldiers. The only thing I learned was that a lot of stretchers were used during the war. The content of this movie was just about enough for a short film, especially if you take out the long sex scenes in the beginning and end, which were apparently only there to add time and to maybe wake you up at the end. Somehow Gitai seems to have thought an art movie means an utterly pretentious, boring movie. What an utter disappointment!"
2,Disappointing,How is it possible to make a war movie boring? especially one about as dramatic of an event as the 1973 October War? well these folks managed to do it. After what seemed like a promising start showing a very huiman element and realistic experience - traffic jams etc - it never built up or got unstuck from that sense of smallness and triviality. It was a disappointing movie and I had difficulty finishing it.
3,Enlightening...but...,"...I really enjoy hearing songwriters sing their own work -- even if they are not necessarily known as performers. Bergman is a lyricist, not really a melody writer, which is probably what drew me to this...and indeed, it is fascinating. Some may complain about his lack of formal singing talent, but I don't think he ever really claims to be the equal of Sinatra or anything. He delivers these songs casually and with a knowing intimacy which really reinvents them. His vocals take a lot of the bombast away from the songs, and invest them with a beautiful, lived-in quality.That said, some things bother me. I feel like the orchestra is unnecessary. A small combo would have been fine. Even more troublesome, though, is what sounds like the rampant use of pitch-correction software. Check out the weird vocoder-like sounds on ""It Might Be You."" If he wasn't able to sing on-key, maybe a second take was in order...that really bothers me...maybe I'm wrong, but I hear it..."
3,Nice 'N' Un-Easy ....,"I heard Mr. and Mrs. Bergman being interviewed on NPR which prompted my search for this CD. Though I greatly admire the lyrics he created with his talented wife, and understand that Alan Bergman might have had a sentimental desire to lend his voice to this recorded collection, his vocalizing is very often disappointing and shallow.The singing of these lovely creations should be left to those with greater vocal virtuosity and dexterity. The CD is entertaining ... though a bit lackluster.E.A.S. Chicago"
2,Lyrically - Alan Bergman,"I was disappointed in the selection of songs. Wouldn't buy for my family and we love music and when I come across an awesome cd, I usually buy for my family. But, I still love Marilyn and Alan!!!!"
5,Songs that glow,"This set of songs creates a mood of love, of the passing of love, of how time slips past and before you know it, what is, was. It is also a tribute to two of the best American lyricists, Alan Bergman and his wife Marilyn, who over the years have teamed with noted composers to create these classic songs.Past reviews have critiqued Alan Bergman's singing capabilities. I hear much beauty in his renditions. First, as a lyricist, he makes sure that you understand every word he sings. Other singers focus on themselves, their technical virtuosity, sometimes to the detriment of the song itself: Bergman enhances the songs. Then, as a man in his eighties, he brings a lifetime of understanding and feeling to each of these songs.He may miss a note here and there. He never misses the songs. They glow in his renditions."
4,A main event--,"Too special for words! If you love the songs, you must have this CD--it's magically--lovely orchestration, sensitive renditions, well-craftedCD--"
4,Recommended Album for Lovers,Lovely album with lyrisist crooning his tunes - written in collaboration with his wife and lifelong companion - with a German symphonic orchestra. The clarity and empathy in the words more than offsets the infrequent flat notes (he is no Tony Bennet). Recommended and we enjoyed it in our household.
2,A novel with potential that peters out in the end.,"Ms. Feldman had the basis for a wonderful story. Unfortunately, she fell short of fully developing it to its potential. The reader is offered tidbits about important characters' lives, with no filling in the gaps in the end. Mack and Bailey's relationship should have been developed more. Bailey became too enmeshed with her ""son"" too quickly. She also ""found"" him too quickly and easily. The truth came out too easily as well. Ms. Feldman rushed the story without giving the reader more to chew on first. I hope her next novel is meatier--I will read it."
3,Good but not indispensible.,"The sound quality of these old recordings varies from harsh (7th symphony) to very good (6th).There is some distortion in the climaxes which hampers the 3rd and 5th symphonies. I enjoyed the Pastorale, though a little more 'thunder' in the thunderstorm would have been nice, and the overtures, especially the 'Coriolan'. Ashistorical documents, worth owning."
5,nothing more to say,"Paul Monette is a hero for so manny people and this book, Borrowed Time is an ever lasting monument for love and relief. It's written with so much love, why does so less people know Paul Monette. It's a shame! I love him and his books, they are all great altough I'm a girl from the Netherlands! more good books? read Adam Mars-Jones. He is also a grat writer, But Paul is the best!"
4,brought my dead computer back to life,My Dell Dimension 1100 was DEAD. Brought back to life thanks to the 1G. Hopefully can get another 5 years out of this $55 investment.
4,Best of Guest!!,"Of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, ""Best in Show"" is definitely the best. The characters and story gel in a perfect comic concoction. ""Best in Show"" is very different than ""Waiting for Guffman"" (the first film in the Guest trilogy), although it brings back many of the same actors. While Guffman has a cruel streak in it, ""Best in Show"" is a little kinder to the characters it skewers -- without losing the laughs.The third film in the trilogy (A Mighty Wind) departs from the formula quite a bit. More of a bittersweet drama, ""Wind"" is just not that funny.If you are Jonesing for a mockumentary fix, search for ""G-Sale"" -- a quirky comedy very much in the Christopher Guest vein. It got a lot of great reviews and was even labeled ""the movie Christopher Guest should have made instead of A Mighty Wind."""
2,Too many rules!,"If you want to use this book you need to read it before you actually get pregnant. I am at the end of my second trimester and all of the rules in this book are overwhelming. I recommend the Husband-coached childbirth: The Bradley Method. I spoke with my midwife about this book,the gentle birth method, she pretty much told me to get rid of it. The only things I liked in the book were the massage methods and yoga positions. So, I give it one star for each of those things."
1,Gross!,"This movie was absolutely horrible! I cannot believe a group of people put this awful stuff on film! The mother gives birth to this disgusting, disrespectful child and nobody chooses to smack the crap out of him. He then goes onto abusing his younger sister. Finally, he does away with his high school class via locking them in the gym and shooting them with arrows. All the while, the mother aspires to get his love. Sick, sick, sick! Disgusting script, horribly movie. Do not make another. Nothing is artsy about this, you twisted pos who made it."
1,Save your time and $$$,"This has to be one of the worst movies of 2012. We decided to watch it because it got high ratings on Amazon and Rotten Tomatoes. However, the entire movie is grossly cliché, with a terrible screenplay, and poorly acted and directed. Tilda Swinton, who is a very talented actress, gives as good as a performance as she can give, considering the poor script and horrible direction. The movie attempts to create psychologically thrilling scenes, but what it really amounts to is pulling some ideas from a psychology case study and piecing them together to make a movie. For instance, Kevin is not a very believable character. He does things and the viewer is left with no idea why other than some text book snippets thrown into the movie at random. The whole movie is disjointed (we couldn't even understand most of what was happening until at least 40 minutes in) in the director's lame attempt to be ""artistic."" Not worth the time... certainly not worth buying."
3,Should have stuck with a linear story,"An important story to be understood but I didn't like the constant flashbacks and so many scenes being played out of order. I know it's supposed to evoke the sense of memory, maybe reminding us that things only seem clearer after the fact but really aren't. I really enjoyed Momento but the non-linear timeline was way more integral to the plot of that movie."
4,"""Glimpse into the Life of a Serial Killer""","A frightenly scary look into what is a very believeable real-life scenario; it doesn't try to answer the nature or nuture question but it definitely fogs the lines...well acted with odd pacing and a few 'unlikely in real life' scenes but overall...great film, it will stick in your head a few days to be sure."
3,"THERE IS NO POINT, THAT'S THE POINT","The film is told in juxtaposing flashbacks with Kevin as a teen (Ezra Miller) and a child (Jasper Newell). It centers around his mother Eva (Tilda Swinton) whose life has gone from having fun in Paris to a living hell. We know Kevin ends up in jail over some haunting event which has caused everyone to hate Eva. The film shows us injured people, a little girl with an eye patch, a man in a wheel chair and we think ""Kevin?"" The film also likes to use the color red.It is a mystery in which everyone knows what has happened except the audience. Kevin is smart, mean, and cynical. He seems to represent a generation raised on too much TV and computers, although we don't see him over indulging in either.Tilda Swinton gives us a great performance in a script that is disjointed by design to give us a specific feel. If you like a film that is designed to make you feel drained after watching it, this is it.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity."
4,We Need to Talk about Kevin,"I really liked this movie. With so much going in our world. It brought some things home. After seeing this movie, for all that see it should start a dialogue. This real and its scary. Good Movie."
2,Good acting; poor screenplay,"Plot and flashbacks are way too choppy. The movie became tedious and boring. The acting was good, but I almost didn't finish watching the movie."
1,Not credible,"I hate movies that insult my intelligence and this is one of those movies. Here is a partial list of what I found too preposterous:a. That this woman would be with this man, give up her lifestyle to become a suburbanite.b. That this woman didn't tell her husband what the son was doing. Like not telling her husband about what she found in the kitchen sink.c. That she never sought professional help for Kevin--or herself.d. That townspeople would treat her the way they did, or that she'd stay in the same town.e. The bows n arrows massacre??? Puh-leeze.The one thing I found positive about the film was the depiction of this woman's repugnance for her baby: if you know anything about infant development, you'll know that a loveless mother can indeed spawn a psychopath like Kevin."
2,"Well-made, but Why made?","This is one of those movies that seemed to me to have been made only to give actors a chance to act. Yes, the performances were great, but I watch movies to be entertained (or made to exercise my brain) by a story, not to marvel at the performances. There was little plot to this movie, and what there was of it was deeply disturbing without any redeeming resolution or moral to the story."
5,Really Scary,Its been a long time since a really good scary movie. Could not watch alone !! Each actor is excellent. Don't miss.
4,Kevin,"This movie is not for the faint of heart, it does speak volumns about mothers and their children. Not an uplifting story, rather melodious."
3,the book was better!,"It's OK, not great. There was so much character development in the book that does not translate to the movie that it was a HUGE disappointment. If you've read the book (which I HIGHLY recommend!) don't bother with the movie. If you haven't read the book, don't bother with the movie just go straight to the book!"
5,A classic study of a child born with serious mental health issues,"This is a very well acted story of a mother who knows her child is seriously mentally ill, but is unable to address the issue before it becomes a fatal issue."
4,A good watch,"The psychological transformation Tilda goes thru is a great piece of work. The characters are very well played, and you empathize with her thru the entire movie."
2,Not good,I didn't like this movie at all. If you are not watching this movie closely you can get confused on what the plot is about. it could have been produced better.
2,it was good in the beginning then i got bored,Its really weird but different at firsti was like heck yeah this is yon a be good then it started sucking
4,Thought provoking,"This was a creepy movie. Tilda Swinton did a good job with the part of Kevin's mom. In light of the recent school shootings, this movie was shocking. Makes you wonder how many 'Kevins' there are out there, that are ticking timebombs. The ending was quite unexpected. This movie is not for kids...I would recommend for the intended audience."
3,Mommie dearest,"Excerpt:Lynne Ramsay's We Need to Talk about Kevin (2011), her first feature in nine years and an adaptation of the novel by Lionel Shriver is, to put it simply, spectacularly messed up.The story follows the life of one Eva Katchadourian (Tilda Swinton) as she gives birth to her son Kevin (played at various ages by Rocky Duer, Jasper Newell, and Ezra Miller as the child, youth, and teenaged Kevin respectively), struggles to raise him to doubtful young adulthood and, much later, live a life made lonely by ostracization from the entire community--though not necessarily in that order. Ramsey shuffles the time order, her way of echoing the novel's structure (a series of letters written by Eva to her husband that look back on her life), leaving clues along the way of something terrible that happens--will happen--later in the film, possibly the reason for her isolated status.Read the rest at[...][...]"
1,VERY DISTURBING AND UNPLEASANT,"I finally watched this movie because I think that Tilda is an amazing actress. However, this movie doesn't do her justice. She is the only thing good about the movie, but it's too painful too watch. In the movie, her son is a true psychopath who seems to have been born with the intent to destroy his mother; he does that and so much more. It raises a question that I often ponder: can one be born EVIL??? Is there a chemical or neurological explanation for the monster that he becomes?"
3,Regret at its finest,"There is so much to be said about this film, but I don't want to spoil it. It went inside the regret a parent must feel when their child does something against society."
4,Dark & Different,I like movies that go outside the typical Hollywood formula and this movie does just that. The performances are all top notch. This movie is a dark and wild ride!
2,Read the Book,"This should never have been made into a movie; the book is a series of letters written by the mother to her husband. By definition, her story plays out in her thoughts and memories, expressed by the book's author in really elegant, often-convoluted language. Her method of writing IS her character. The movie plucks events from the book without being able to show the thoughts and perceptions that caused them, so we never get a solid understanding of who these people are, and how complex they are. The book is terrific. Nothing wrong with the acting; Tilda Swinton and the actors who play her son do as good a job as they can with what they are given."
4,Chilling Movie.,"This movie isn't only timely, but one that everyone needs to see. It's amazing how many problems go ignored until it is too late."
3,Good Acting but too slow,"The acting was great but nobody really says anything until about an hour into the movie. You just have to figure out why this woman is so depressed by going between the present and past without much dialog. I did find alot of the script interesting. It seems that the only person and time that Kevin shows a tiny bit of respect is when he has been disiplined, which doesn't happen often from his dad."
2,A Father in Denial,The only really good performance in this movie was the actor who played Kevin. My daughter has read the book and says it's really good. I did not find the female lead in this appealing. I hope there are no real women out there who are such doormats. Movie jumps around too much. Don't waste your money; buy the book instead.
4,Loved It..Great Indie moie,"I usually do find Indie movies better than mainstream. There is more character acting. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I don't ever remember seeing it advertised.Although slighlty depressing, the acting is wonderful. I was thinking how i would have handled the situation as Kevin's mother.Worth your time & money."
4,Great movie!,"My teenage daughter & I watched this movie together. We both really enjoyed it. I love Tilda Swinton- she does some intense movies. I do not like blood, but this movie is more pyshological than blood & guts. Go see this movie..."
1,we need to talk about kevin,Probably one of the worst movies I ever watched. The plot was mindless that seemed to be made up as it went along. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
1,Save yourself,"This certainly ranks right near the top of both the most boring and depressing movie I've ever seen. It was painful to watch, and I don't know how I made it to the end. How this had a four-star rating is beyond me. Save yourself."
2,We need to talk about Kevin review,This movie is very quirky and it has music that doesn't fit the plot. I don't like it. It was a waste of money. I don't recommend you wasting your money watching this movie.
1,had a better time putting salt in my eyes,This has to be by far the worst movie ever and that's including Whoopi Goldberg movies. I don't know what retarded hipster made this movie but I've seen better movies made by 3 year holds with a camera phone. I literally rather chew on cardboard then ever be forced to watch this talentless dry movie that sucks more than a shop vacuum. Ugh sheer disappointment. The dog didn't even wanna stay in the room for this one. And he likes bad movies.
1,We need To Talk About Kevin,This was a very strange and dark movie and I was not a fan. It simply was not enjoyable to watch.
1,Not good,this movie was not good at all it was hard to follow and just very very slow. I did watch the entire movie although it was very hard and still did not find it enjoyable
4,"Compelling story; artsy photog and too much music, though","The photography draws too much attention to itself, while the soundtrack is unending and overwhelming at times. However, the story itself is compelling and haunting to watch. Does the boy become bad because his mother feels nothing for him, or was he born bad and she just had a feeling he would only get worse? That is the central mystery in this tragic tale."
1,DISJOINTED,"THIS MOVIE WAS DISJOINTED AND HARD TO FOLLOW. I WATCHED ABOUT 1 HOUR AND HAD TO SHUT IT OFF. BORING, TOO HARD TO FOLLOW, NOT ENTERTAINING. I DIDN'T GET THE GIST OF THE TALE AT ALL."
2,"Attack of the mean mugging, hipster twink.","When one thinks of mentally ill, disturbed, introverted psychopaths. A heart-throbish looking teenager who prances around in shirts 3 sizes too small with a ""too cool for the room"" delivery is not what usually comes to mind. Did his parents never buy him any shirts after the age of 5 and that's why he snapped? I know that in movies you have to suspend the expectation of realism sometimes. But in drama (unless it's presented as a surrealistic film) you want to have some believable characters which this movie lacks in a big way."
5,Mind Numbing,"Man, this is some seriously messed up stuff. If you need your mind blown away for whatever reason - watch this one. I could have skipped the daughter part though. That part made me literally sick to my stomach."
3,"Good movie, had the potential to be more","The way this movie was done frustrated us because it could have been a really good movie but it was so back and forth and scenes shown out of order, that it distracted from our ability to fully get into it and enjoy it. It also felt too artsy for us.The acting was really convincing, especially by the son, both young and older. He was so good that we felt the extreme dislike for him. There were many conversation-starters that happened...Why didn't the Mom just set up a hidden camera to capture how the son treated her when the Dad wasn't watching since he had such a hard time believing her. What would we do if we had a kid that was that easy to dislike, etc.I am going to read the book now and see if it gives me more insight into the relationships between the parents and the kid and if it answers a lot of the questions that the film didn't.It was a good movie and still worth the rental amount, but I felt it could have been told in a more organized way."
1,Highly disappointed,Saw this movie on on demand and was so very disappointed. The book was great. I think maybe it is the kind of story that does not easily convert to the movies because there is alot of thoughts in the book. I am just glad I only paid $4.95 and diden't buy the dvd. The movie did not do the book justice.
2,Sandy Hook may kill the rentals of this film,"This is an overly complicated telling of a simple story. Visually, it was compeling but, I knew what was going on and predicted the outcome. Tilda Swinton is appropriately pained as the mother. John C. Reilly is appropriately clueless as the father."
2,stupid,"Half assed story, at best. t takes entirely too long to write a separate, thoughtful review for each movie watched, and each product purchased. if I'm going to be a critic, I want to get paid."
4,We need to talk about Kevin,"I read the book and could not wait to see the movie.I will tell you this, if I had not read the book, I would have no idea what was really going on."
2,Watching Stupor and Misery make Me Miserable. Don't Rent.,"I agree that Tilda is a good actress, but her constant shock and miserable expressions were not enough to hold this movie together. I didn't feel any sympathy for her character, which seems to be a necessary component to liking the film?And I wasn't a fan of the costume design for her post-incident wardrobe.If you are on the fence about renting, I say pass."
1,Don't bother!,Actors played as best they could but the plot was all over the board - IMO it was a wasted evening!
1,Terrible,"Roger Ebert's review is on-point -- completely confused timeline, NO action, more of a collage than a movie. Saw it on DVD, wish I could give it zero stars."
5,Nature versus Nurture,"A wonderful psychological thriller that brings up the question of what was the cause for Kevin being a sociopath, his mother's apathy as a parent, or genetics? The movie will make you question what was the primary source of Kevin's emotional issues, as well as follows the unhealthy relationship of him and his mother. The movie is based off of a book which goes into detail on how Kevin's mother, while pregnant with him, was completely apathetic to the idea of being a parent, something that may or may not have affected how Kevin turned out. This movie is great, with acting from the talented Ezra Miller, and has a twisted ending."
1,Waaaaaay tooo slooooow to develop a plot. It just was not entertaining at all.,"I like Tilda Swinton, but the movie was just boring as heck. Not creepy, just predictable, and devoid of any action."
3,A friend had recommended this...,"Because a friend told me I needed to see this movie, I ordered it. I did not enjoy it as my friend had. I didn't feel that it developed the characters broadly enough, and I hated the flipping back and forth in time. I would not buy it if I'd have known."
1,We need to talk about Kevin,The book is so much better - Twilda is good but not good enough to hold this movie together - they tried to turn this story into an art film - when if they would have been true to the story it would have been great
3,good movie.,"although it was predictable in the end and you can easily determine what is going to happen, i somewhat enjoyed the movie. its not a RIVETING movie or anything... but not too bad."
3,"Good idea, but disjointed plot doesn't come together easily","Multiple plots co-occur, but none is really focused on long enough to be engaging. This movie would have benefitted from a bit more detail and dialogue. Didn't do justice to what otherwise was a good idea."
3,Not as good as the book...,"I read this book and loved it. It is extremely dark, but as someone who studied psychology I found it fascinating. The movie was not quite as good, but I think they did the best they could and I did find it entertaining. All of the actors are great in their respective roles, I just thought some of the story fell short. If I had not read the book prior, I'm sure I would have felt differently. Overall, if you are in the mood for a well done movie with a seriously dark theme, I recommend ""We Need to Talk about Kevin""."
2,Over-rated,"For my money, you can skip this depressing stuff. Not much redeeming value - performances are o.k. Spend your money on something better."
3,Improvement over Microsoft documentation .... barely,"This book is basically an extended rehash of the documentation. It is surely an improvement over what ships with InterDev, but given the sorry state of the documentation, that's faint praise indeed.If you want inside tips, and advanced examples of how to APPLY the tool to real-time situations, keep checking the other titles.Marc Fairort"
5,Great book for learning this latest technology! Get it!,"Until this point, I had been reading the documentation that comes with Visual InterDev. What a difference this book makes. Its well written, neatly organized, and clearly explainshow to take full advantage of Visual InterDevand ActiveX controls. Great book. Get it."
1,772 pages of fluff.,"This book reminds me of when I was in High School and had to ""BS"" my way through a report with a specific page minimum when I didn't know the subject. The author talks about all sorts of distantly-related topics and barely touches the surface of InterDev and ASP."
2,'This is a wrong book to learn Visual Interdev,"The book tries to cover everything in a same volume. It makes the coverage of individual features of V/Dev very shallow. It also fails to warn buyers that some features of the software, such as Database Designer, only works with specific databases such as M/S SQL Server 6 and/or Oracle 7 etc.. Wrong learning material for beginners."
2,21 Days is a joke!,This book should be renamed Don't Teach Yourself Visual Interdev in 21 Days. I've been struggling through it for about 100 days now and I'm only up to Day 12. The organization into daily lessons and summaries is irritating and the lessons have left me with only a hazy idea of what Interdev can do. Practical examples and useful code are sorely lacking. My recommendation is not to bother with this book--there have got to be better tutorials out by now. I'm going to try Mastering Visual InterDev as I've found a lot of useful material in Mastering FrontPage.
2,This will teach you very little,"I've been working for days in this book and learning almostnothing. It's big on overview and throwing tons of buzz words aroundbut doesn't actuallly teach much. The author spends incredable amounts of time introducing and summarzing each chapter but since there's nothing worth reading in the chapter, what's the point. Looking at the back of the book it has a scale indicating who the book it aimed at. It runs the gambit from novice to sub-expert and I'd guess this would be a good book for a manager to read so that he can know all the latest buzz words and some high level concepts but doesn't actually have to work with Visual Interdev. Also, the material on VB Script and ASP is very rudimentary."
2,"Poor content, pooly written.",The author spends more time previewing and reviewing each chapter than he does informing you about Interdev.This book will not teach you much about Interdev or Active Server Pages which it also briefly covers
1,This book is a waste of time,"This book is awful. Don't buy it. I got it for free and decided it wasn't worth my time to continue reading it. It wastes too much time on cutesy introductory material. I simply want to know how to use the VID tool. I don't want an all encompassing, yet thoroughly vague explanation on every other web topic."
2,OK... Now What......?,"The book gives some good examples of code but nothing you can't find on the Net. The thing that made me the most frustrated and still does is when he would show step-by-step how to access a ""Access Database"" with DTC's but then would end there.... You would go and test it out i.e. click the button to send the form info to the database and nothing would work - in the book it just shows you how to access the ODBC Database but NEVER FOLLOWS THROUGH on how to tell you any other little code lines you may have to manually add yourself or something - So I got as far as connecting the Database of Access97 ooh boy I could do that before I wasted my money.."
1,Wait for a better title or read the documentation instead,"I've seen more effort in this book trying to cover the history of the Internet than Interdev itself.Having read the (free) documentation, I found this book simply useless"
1,happy happy,"this book is a waste of time, i am an experienced programmer and have tought myself many programs (like I was trying to do with interdev) and this book goes through so much wishy washy feel good because the internet is such a wonderful thing bull that the main points and (often incorrect) code examples get lost"
1,Buy something else,"I was thoroughly dissappointed in this book. I have gotten other 'Learn.. in 21 Days' and learned a lot. This was not the case this time. The CD-ROM didn't have half the samples and some other files on it, that the book said it did. This book is more of a beginners manual for HTML, and not so much for Visual InterDev. FIND ANOTHER BOOK!"
1,Worse book I ever seen,"This book don't worth the cost. After reading all the inside material, I didn't able to implement any web application."
5,a justice league show that gives super the respect he deserves,Finally a justice league show that gives superman the respect that he deserves this series i remeber from the 1980's it is such a shame and when i say shame i mean shame and boy do i really really really really really mean it is a shame that the so called justice league series that was done a few years ago was not more like this.
3,Really Really hoping for more,"I am glad that WB is continuing to release different incarnations of the Super-Friendsa, and will hopefully release them all, but I have concerns with the lack of content of this set. The 1984 season of ""Superfriends:The Legendary Superpowers show"" only had eight 1/2 hour episodes (sixteen, 11 minute episodes if you break them down), but with most DVD box sets all that could easily fit on one disk. I am hoping the 2nd disk has the follow up season ""Galactic Guardians"", which only had seven 1/2 hour episodes with some being a full 1/2 hour, and some being two short episodes. These would be great to package together as one set, but I fear WB will get cheap and try to get the most for their money that they can. Lets just hope they decide on what most fans would like, so that their DVD sales can continue to be profitable."
2,LAME,THE WHOLE 'SUPER FRIENDS' SAGA WAS LAME 'WONDER WOMAN' WHO IS 'THE STRONGEST/FASTEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD' IS SHOWN HAVING 'HUMAN' STRENTH. AND HELPLESS. AND OTHER INSULTS.
3,"Good stories, but missing a few stars as well","The plots/storylines were good in this series. It is good to see a variety of superheroes in this series as well. However, there is no Aquaman, Flash, Hawkman (and Hawkgirl), or the Atom, 4 of DC's more prominent characters as well as characters of the superfriends. Also, Green Lantern appears only for a short time in only one episode. In my opinion, this series gives too much attention to the ""affirmative action"" superfriends such as Apache Chief, Black Vulcan, Samurai, and El Dorado. However, this could be somewhat fair since Samurai especially was neglected during Challenge of the Superfriends. Also El Dorado had not been created during that time.If the 5 or 6 missing superfriends stated up above appeared in this series, then this one would have been the best superfriends season in my opinion."
3,NO AQUAMAN & NO LEGION OF DOOM...hmmmmm,"I grew up on Superfriends, but somehow this series was not the one I was wanting. But it still takes you back..the lines are so cheesy lol. My buddy dropped by one time while I was lounging and he got a kick out of the lines. It has Firestorm, Apache Chief, Black Vulture, that spinning samurai guy & the twins that high-5 and morph (forgot their names). It didnt have Aquaman, which was one of my favorites. And it didnt have the legion of doom. Most were with The Darkside as the villain."
2,Superman (pukes!),"The Superman overload is toooooo much. Almost every villian on this collection is a Superman Rogue. That includes Darkseid, Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Mxypltlk?, etc... We only get one segment that features another hero's rogue and that is Mirror Master. What is odd is that The Flash is not even in that one...it is all about friggin' Superman getting trapped in mirrors! Geez. DC really needs to realize that there are other heroes and villians outside of Metropolis."
1,These were just AWFUL!!,"These were the absolute WORST of any of the animated superhero shows.As a kid I loved the Super Friends of the 70's, I loved the JL and JLU of the 90's, I loved Batman, and Batman Beyond and Superman of the 90's and 2000's as well. If its a cartoon with a superhero and doing super stuff I am for the most part happy. I am not not what you would call picky. So I dont give a one star lightly. But I couldnt stand these when I first saw them when I was 10 and after watching a couple on Boomerang I like them even less. This edition of the Justice League was pure campy garbage. Its really THAT BAD!!"
3,Worst version of super friends i have seen,"I own all the different versions of superfriends on dvd and just started watching this one recently and man it's BAD and i'm not talking the good kind! The biggest offense to me is the hatchet job they did to my beloved Wonder Woman, changing her voice actress i believe to what sounds like sone air-headed bimbo, stripping her of her powers and making her a helpless boy toy whom everyone from Firestorm to Dark seid wants a piece of, the episodes are lame and they have aqua man in the theme song but not in the show?? If you're a HUGE dc fan like myself and must own everything superfriends then yeah at the current price it's an ok deal, but be warned there is nothing super about this version of the show"
4,Just as corny as I remembered!,"Along with ""Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians"" & re-runs of ""Challenge of the Superfriends"", this cartoon was a highlight of many a Saturday morning. Next to ""Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends"" this particular cartoon was one of my favorites as a kid.This 2 disc set complete with commentaries of select episodes (by comic book writer Mark Waid no less!) and 2 short documentaries will certainly hit the spot if you're a child of the '80s.Before the legendary DC animated incarnations of today, this camp fest was the best there was in it's time. These episodes are still entertaining despite their dumbed down scripts and low-end animation. The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the fact that I've been so spoiled by modern day cartoons which finally take all this super-hero schtick seriously. Still GREAT fun though!"
3,Just what I expected,"Good ol' fashioned super hero fun from Saturday mornings, just what I expected to get, not good , not horrible, but good memories."
5,May cause birth defects,"Cylob is the master of distortion to hip hop. This short cd is the proof. Sounds that make you wanna turn it down soon lead to chants of ""i gotta play this for my friends"""
5,Genie in the bottle,I hear the song in the radio in english and in spanish and I think that the songs are so cool.
3,"I like the song, but........","I have to agree that ""Genie In A Bottle,"" the first single by this girl, is very good. However, like most of the songs that get so much radio play, it ultimately gets annoying. Enjoy it while it lasts."
4,Beck-Arnley 173-7867ignition rotor,"The Beck/Arnley 173-7867 ignition rotor is the perfect replacement part for my application and best of all it says it""s made in Japan."
3,For Love Hina Type Fans,"This Series which had an excellent first few episodes degrades quickly to traditional lite anime plot devices. The pet, the clumsy person, the letchers, the ghost stories, etc. There are still occasional moments of a growing love relationship between the two principal characters, and that makes it fair. Unfortunately the original promise of the series does not reappear until near the of its 26 episode run. Fans of the romantic genre should wait for upcoming release of Maison Ikkoku.If you have to buy everything romantic thats out there ok, but remember this is simply light fan fair for most of the remaining episodes. You get the obligatory crushes, beach episodes, and road trips. If you skip to the last DVD in the series after buying the first and just get those two you really won't miss much in between."
4,Great Series!,"At first many people who look at it may say it looks like another Love Hina,which I also collect,but let me tell you it isn't really.The characters are great.The stories are more original.In some ways it is much better than Love Hina.I fully recommend this series to any anime fans who love romance animes.Believe me you won't be sorry."
4,Pretty good - from someone who has not seen the Hayley Mills version,"First, let me say that I have not seen the Hayley Mills version of this film, nor have I read the book. So I do not know how it compares to those versions of the story. Ergo at face value this move is pretty good. I wouldn't give it five stars, but we did enjoy it very much. The acting was excellent by some and somewhat mediocre by others (specifically the girl who plays Rusty). But, all in all, one did get a good sense of the tension and difficulties that the family had when returning to one another in England at the end of World War II. Some characters were not developed enough, and I have the feeling that this accordingly could have been made into a mini-series instead of just a 90-minute movie. But it was enjoyable and had beautiful scenery and period costumes."
1,"Badly Done, Pointless, Cliff Notes Version","Having loved the book, and remembering the first film version of ""Back Home"", I had great hopes for it this time around. While the Disney version left something to be desired, this one was just absolutely DREADFUL with a capital D. I'd rather live in dreary old World War II England than have to watch this film again.The acting is horribly wooden. The script/screenplay is as if the writer and director only got a cliff notes, very summarized version of the book. Maybe they read a book report on it that got an F. The sets and things look cheap, in fact the whole film looks as if it was very cheaply done.Don't bother seeing it. Read the book. Or put on your own version in a film made by yourself and your friends. It will probably be better written, acted, and more professional."
3,It's ok.,It's not quite tall enough so if you have a high plate or bowl it sits in your food. But it gets the job done...
1,Very Poor Quality,Bent on the very second use. Very poor quality cheap plastic material. Complete waste of money. I would rate it as my worst purchase on Amazon.
4,Better Than a Paper Towel,"This food cover is great for keeping splatters down in the microwave. I don't like plastic and have searched high and low for a glass cover but suppose it has not been invented yet, so this will have to do for now."
2,Microwave food cover,It is a little thinner than I would have liked compared to the ones I had before but it does the job.
4,Really helps keep microwave cleaner,"This could be about 1"" wider, but over all it works really well to sit on top of a plate of food or a container to keep the inside of the microwave much cleaner."
5,Microwave Food Lid,"A great substitute for paper tissues when you need to cover food in the microwave. It's recyclable (you just wash and re-use it), and very practical. Replaced an old one with the same kind, which is the product I am writing a review for."
1,wrong amount of itrms,Watch out this is a false item they only shipped 1 item instead of 2 like the web says ....and when you call them they have no Idea that they have the item as a set of 2....dont buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amazon does a great job of helpping......
4,Works fine but is thinner than expected,We use this in our home microwave. So far it has held up just fine but seems to be much thinner than the one that it replaced. Washes without problems in the dishwasher.
2,Mine melted,"First time I used this was for a bowl of soup. Can directions called for me to heat the soup covered for 3 minutes. I placed this product on top of my microwaveable safe bowl, and 3 minutes later, the heat from the bowl sucked and warped the middle of this cover down into the bowl. I had to get a fork to pry the thing off the bowl. It is now warped in the middle.Might work for plates, but didn't on my bowl. :("
3,Was expecting a taller product,"It works well, no real genius there. But u can't use it for bowls n stuff. Its not tall enough and every other time the food will touch the underside which I would rather it not. So I end up not using it as much. It's fine for smaller plates with little food in it."
