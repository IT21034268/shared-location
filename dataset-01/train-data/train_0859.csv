4,Good Stuff,"I really like this cd. Andy tells good stories, and the subjects are ones I can relate to. I have ""What we Are"" & ""Blink"" stuck in my head. I have recommended this cd to many of my friends."
4,Very Interesting,"Japanese design is different to Western design in terms of living requirements.I now have a much deeper understanding of the creation of small living spaces that work well rather than building bigger for re-sale or convention.Hopefully, my own home (when built) will be an east-west fusion that I will enjoy for a long time.This book is part of my collection on 'small home' design and one which I return to when I need to remind myself about scaling down."
5,interesting list of architects,"is more that a very usefull book to develop news ideas of reduced spaces. ingenius designers, generous pictures, different styles, eighteen examples."
2,1700sqft are BIG and luxurious in Hong Kong,"""Small"" is a matter of perspective, especially if you live in a 700sqft apartment and expect to get some ideas to use in small 300-450sqft apartments on Hong Kong Island."
2,It's ok but not to Canadian code,The book is full of ideas but most not really practical when it comes to code and fire safety issues in canada. I was expecting more out of this book.......... slightly dissapointing.
3,For Kids and Just Plain Folks,"I am a big Pete Seeger fan, but I was very disappointed with this album. The material is classic and very singable. This album, however, is live and features a VERY LOUD concert audience who sing along with the music, but not really in unison. They actually drown out Seeger's voice so that you can barely hear him. The result is very chaotic and hard to listen to even though I love the songs. This would have been a great concert to attend in person, but it is extremely annoying to listen to the recording."
1,Not So Good,"Undoubtedly, Pete Seeger is one of the great musical/political wonders of our time and he really is a great man (I saw him perform live in New York right after he had been let out of prison)...but I really don't like this album and I'll tell you why... when I was growing up in the 80s, my parents would always quote 'Be Kind To Your Parents' and I realized that they were right but make no mistake, the song 'Be Kind To Your Parents' itself is not good... it's not good at all... and it feels kind of like a feeble attempt to achieve a folk/goodie goodie kind of idiom that could make me... well I won't even go there.."
5,Entertainer who toured Vietnam,"As an Australian entertainer who went to Vietnam to entertain the US troops, this film depicted the way it was for those of us who spent months and sometimes years,in Vietnam."
4,Passing True Life Drama,"This book was hyped by one of its reviewers as comparable to ""A Civil Action"" by Jonathan Harr. Actually, it is not as good as that book, but it is a generally diverting story about corporate greed and one odd insider's attempt to expose this dirty seam of capitalism. That the main character turns out to be a not-very-likeable fellow who has a problem with believability adds a certain twist to the proceedings, but the story has so many skeins and personalities that it is sometimes difficult for the reader to keep all the players and machinations straight. Nonetheless, it is worth the effort and I recommend this book."
5,Lysine larceny-an oustanding book.,"I had purchased The Informant as a resource book for my next novel little knowing what an outstanding story lay within. I was quick to realize that the non-fiction book that I was reading read like a fiction thriller. Many times, as author Kurt Eichenwald vividly described the process of how the FBI groomed their informant, I realized that I was feeling both tense and anxious. I know that only a very powerful story could invoke those emotions in me.Needless to say The Informant proved an excellent book for me to read. The bonus for me was that I got all of the information I needed to craft my next fiction novel, which will deal with an FBI and Navy sting operation and an informant.I might add that The Constant Gardener by John Le Carre, just released an on it's way to being a bestseller (see my review), deals with something similar to the Archer Daniels Midland anti trust case. In Le Carre's book it is the pharmaceutical-government complex that are the bad guys."
5,The best thrillers are true stories,"This true story of the fall of ADM is engaging and captivating. If you have any interest in big business and how it impacts on everyday life of everyday people, you will enjoy this glimpse inside ADM. The overarching story about a vast international conspiracy to fix prices is a gripping story of personal and corporate greed run amok. Ultimately, the actions of Mark Whitacre detailed here by Eichenwald affected many different people who never heard his name or knew his story. The story told here shows how much can go on in the world of corporate America to affect the lives of every person. Told in a straightforward manner, the story here is easy to follow and would be a great book if it were a piece of fiction. That the story is completely true makes The Informant all that much more gripping."
4,Interesting look into the White Collar World,"Definitely not Grisham, but all of the intrigue is still there. In fact, many of the events that take place would never fly in a fiction work...they'd be thought too outrageous. For Eichenwald to keep me, a mostly science-fiction reader captivated throughout all six-hundred pages is reason enough for me to recommend the book to most anyone. Steadily entertaining development for you action-oriented readers and just enough to whet the appetite of any conspiracy theorists out there."
4,Truth is stranger than fiction . . .,"Get ready for a string of groggy days at work, because this fantastic story will keep you up into the wee hours with its wild characters and unpredictable plot twists. I always wondered what those Supermarket to the World folks were up to, with their friendly yet deliberately vague commercials on NPR and the Sunday morning talk shows. Now I know - scheming, stealing, and stabbing customers in the back.Kurt Eichenwald does a superb job of bringing the characters to life, especially the FBI agents who slogged through plenty of dark days in this lengthy investigation. What will keep you hooked though, are the endless shenanigans of their main witness. His constant machinations rival any complex plot twist in modern fiction. Enjoy!"
5,unbelievable !,"This book is just uncredible. Obviously things are happening beyond our expectations, but facts related here are really over the hedge ! Second half of the book is breathtaking."
4,Patience Is a Virtue. . .,"that I really don't possess as a reader. And I love to read long and involved books. I do it all the time. Having bought and read Mr. Eichenwald's Conspiracy for Fools, I was more than eager to delve into this. Yet, here I am on page 219, and I'm still waiting for the bizarre and crazy that's promised in so many of the reviews here. Instead I've gotten 200+ pages of the same routine over and over again. Meetings w/ taping and surveillance. Behind the scenes with the FBI. And then more meeting w/ taping and surveillance.I intend to finish this book, because I love the corporate espionage/subversive true story as much as anyone else and am chomping at the bit to get to the meat of the matter. How long do I have to wait? Another 100 pages?This book is well written and researched, but a good editor would have tightened this story up a lot.Siouxie, The Bronx"
4,I thought this book was excellent!,"I enjoyed this book very much. I am from Decatur, IL and it was fun reading about places and people that I was familiar with. Can't wait til the movie comes out!"
5,Riveting!,"I ordered this book because the events took place right in my hometown, and the movie is currently filming here as well! Not only was it fun to read about familiar places, etc., but I really did not expect to be so enthralled with a story about price-fixing of a product most people have never even heard of, by a relatively unknown company, albeit with powerful political connections. The author does an excellent job explaining these things, and relates this true story in a way that keeps one hooked."
4,rollercoaster of a tale,"Very well written, with lots of attention to detail (almost to the point of losing the reader somewhere around page 500)! Well worth the time spent to read it, difficult to put down, and thoroughly enjoyable."
4,What a whoos,It was like reading the redacted files of some major conspiracy. Was it really true? I almost felt like I was to blame and part of the cover-up. Great read.
2,"very long, confusing, tedious and boring","This book is a muddling account of the ADM price fixing scandal. It is very long, confusing, tedious, and often boring. The story line is so strange and unclear at times. This book in no way is as good as his book about the Enron scandal. I was very disappointed in it."
5,Gripping Story Reads Like a Novel,"Proving once again that truth is stranger than fiction, and much more interesting in many cases, Kurt Eichenwald writes a riveting account of corporate deceit which compels the reader to continue turning the pages. Fiction writers could take a lesson as plot twists permeate the story. Throughout the book, this reader attempted to determine who was more guilty: the corporation or the corporate executive. This book tells the story of a corporate environment in which illegal activities were not only accepted at the highest levels but were encouraged. Almost as interesting is the lesson of how difficult it is for the government to put a case together especially one that appeared to be served right up to the FBI. A great book!"
5,Suspenseful true white-collar crime,"This book will be a worthy investment of your time if you enjoy tales of business corruption along the lines of The Smartest Guys in the Room (Encon), white-collar crime in general, or how the FBI investigates and prosecutes white-collar crime. At the end of they day, the best thing about this story is it's true. It's hard to believe business leaders like the ones described in this book could be so flagrantly corrupt. The central figure of the story Mark Whitacre, is both comic and tragic, and ultimately sympathetic.All-in-all, a highly enjoyable and successful true suspense story.I listened to the Informant unabridged on audio CD, narrated by Arthur Morey. Morey does an excellent job keeping a suspenseful pace and bringing out the complexity of the characters."
2,annoying,"This book should have been cut in half, if only to save the reader from the tedious conversations that are ""recalled"" by the participants. But that wouldn't have even saved this book, in my opinion. Why all the hype and good sales for this atrocity? Most puzzling. This book had lots of praise and hype: ""One of the best nonfiction books of the last decade"" according to a New York Times review. Fair enough; sounds like this would be a good pick, right? I made it through nearly two-hundred pages (and that wasn't even half the book) before giving up. Too much boring, reconstructed dialogue and a less-than-riveting story (price fixing; oh how diabolical!) only make me crave good fiction. But then again, books that are written like this make me wonder how much of the story was really accurate."
3,Very good but not completely Mediterranean,"The book written by Ms. Roden is a very good book containing interesting recipes, but I do not consider it as Mediterranean. It is more North African. Olive oil, garlic and fish are the three thingns that symbolyse the region. They lack in the book. I hope that they will appear in the next printings. If needed; I am ready to assist with recipes."
2,eh,"Well when i got this in the mail i was expecting the usual warped dvd of band interviews and awsome performances. Although, this wasn't what i expected. Instead it was mostly a PETA protest video and nothing about warped tour. They do have some performances but the sound is horrible and its from small bands and really bad bands. If your a PETA follower, but this. If your looking for a good warped dvd with interviews and performances, go somewhere else"
4,WUS,Love it! I have seen a lot of the Warped Tour DVDs and this is now my favorite. The sound and graphics were amazingly cool. and I just have to say that I LOVE Story of the Year so much! Adam is awesome. Is nice to see a new kind of warped movie.
5,A pleasant detour on the Di Meola road...,"Given the decades of spectacular musicianship and collaboration on Di Meola's albums, it should come as no surprise that the composition of World Sinfonia II is as beautiful as it is imaginative. Though I'm of the camp that prefers a lesser degree of accordion in Di Meola's compositions, it's presence adds a matecom of quirkiness to the already great depth of the album. While not the most musically explosive of his albums, World Sinfonia II provides more of a lyrical sound to complement the abundance of acoustic guitar. Overall a good buy, though I do prefer the first World Sinfonia in terms of excitement, as well as The Grand Passion.In general, this is an album to be added to the Di Meola fan's collection, rather than to be used as a starting point for the new listener."
4,Quick weight loss,"This diet really does work! I am on medication that causes weight gain, yet I was still able to lose with this diet. I tried Atkins, but the weight was coming off too slowly. I recommend this to anybody who is having trouble losing weight."
5,THANK YOU DOCTOR STILLMAN. PLEASE MAKE A COMEACK,"Wonderful book. Best diet ever. So easy. So satisfying. So inspiring. Please consider reprinting. The protien diets are back in full force, and yours is the best. I lost 15 lbs in 2 week and felt so good, I went on 2 more weeks and lost a total of 25 lbs. I also lost my book somehow and have looked everywhere for a new one. PLEASE MAKE A COMEBACK!!"
2,Painful to read,"I am sure this book has its facts down right, and was well-researched. It is, however, a chore to read. There's very little action or drama. If you are looking for plain facts presented accurately but with no life breathed into dead prose--you have found it here!"
5,Good reference book if you own a horse(s),This book is a good reference book if you own a horse(s). It is easy to read and covers a wide variety of condition and diseases.
4,Good all around vet book,"This is a good reference manual for nearly all of the common diseases, injuries, etc that horses incur. Goes over basics, not indepth details on most items. Good information on equine nutrition and good emergency first aid instructions. Extensive information on breeding and foaling, way too much for my needs, that is my only complaint. Pretty current on modern technology (treatments/nutrition). I would recommend as an addition to a horse owner's library."
5,Complete wonderfull book,"This book was bought for my 10 year old daughter. It is wonderful, everything and every question is answered in this book."
5,Horses Owners Vet Handbook,This was used as a Referrel and Research. I helped take care of a friends horses and wanted to brush up on Horses
3,Detailed but hard to read,"While the authors obviously know their stuff, I found it hard to read given the excessive and slightly archaic verbage; I would've preferred something much more consise, perhaps in a ""bullet"" fashion, rather than a tome."
5,Much Needed Reference Book,It doesn't hurt to have something handy for reference when an injury presents itself. I love the idea of having this reference in my library.One of many different reference books I own for my herd of 14 horses.R.D.Hot on the Range
1,False Advertising,"I have bought the CD because of the extra bonus songs that are remix version of ""doot doot"" as advertised but when the CD came it was a different version of the CD. Bogus! !!"
3,How do you get from this to Underworld?,"I am amazed at amazon for carrying this item in the first place, A friend of mine said that if I was going to get this album then I'd have to import it.The reason I am interested in this album is because it is the first project of the boys of the techno group Underworld. I kid you not. Its hard to imagine how they got from ""Doot Doot"" to ""Pearls Girl"" and ""Born Slippy""... I guess you have to start somewhere, and hey it was the 80's..."
3,3 good songs,"My 80's collection would not be complete without the excellent tracks 'Doot Doot' and 'The Road'. Getting an extended version of 'Doot Doot' was the bonus that caused me to buy this CD vice a used copy of the original.. I believe it was worth it, even though there is nothing astounding in the extended version. There are no gems in the rest of the tracks. :-)"
2,"4 stars for 1 song, 1 star for the rest of the album :-(","I've been looking to add ""Doot Doot"" to my 80's collection for some time, so when I did find it, Ive been excited to receive and listen, perhaps the other reviews had me more excited than I should have been. The down to earth honesty is the ONE track I was looking for was good and the rest just honestly awful. If I had bought this new I would be irritated to pay full price for one song, but...thankfully I bought it used (whew).4 stars for ""doot doot"", 1 star for the rest."
4,Old style Hag at his best.,"Merle always sings from the heart but this gospel album seems he gave it a real spiritual commitment. You can feel the emotion in his voice especially on ""A cabin in the Hills"" and "" After we go to guns"".Undoubtetly this will be another legacy Merle will leave us to enjoy and question our own mortality."
4,Beautiful and useful,This hairdryer is wonderful. Works great! Enjoy ease of use and looks. Only drawback is the additional parts tend to fall off easily.
3,Alright for the price,I have had this hair dryer for almost 2 years (I think) and it finally died today. It drove me nuts how it would shut itself off after getting hot. So everytime I turned it off I would turn on the cool button so I could turn it right back on when needed to. It's a good safety feature but really annoying when your trying to get ready in the morning with limited amount of time. I will not be buying this hair dryer again.
2,smells like somthing's burning,"I have used this dryer for a couple of years with no problems but just started noticing the burning smell (mentioned in a previous review) when using the high setting. The smell is worrisome enough to stop me from using it, and I'll be getting a replacement soon."
5,Calming & Peaceful,"If you enjoyed Robbie Robertson & The Red Road Ensemble, this one sounds to me like a compliment and a must"
4,Faith Ringgold fans will not be disappointed!,"The Invisible Princess is an enchanting 'fairy tale' that draws on African American Slave myths and legends. As always, Ringgold provides fascinating background information at the close of the story. The only character on the plantation who can see the daughter of two slaves, the Invisible Princess, is the plantation owner's blind daughter. He is forced to make a powerful decision that changes his life, and the lives of many people. Creatures and forces of nature are personified utilizing a range of gender and race. Ms. Ringgold's illustrations are in keeping with her unique style, though I've been yearning for another with the quilt motif."
5,Very Pleased,"This is the fourth or fifth replacement of this item as it is perfect for my hairstyle needs. Please don't discontinue it, EVER!"
5,A MUST Have!!!!,"I have had one of these since they came out. Well actually, 2. Long life for a brush/hairdryer combo. I have fine hair and with a bit of gel ... Amazing body. Love it!"
5,Great Item,"I bought one of these several years ago and used it all the time. Recently, it broke while traveling and I bought a similar (different brand) item to replace it. The similiar item did not measure up. I finally found the exact one here on Amazon and bought it. I could not find another to measure up to it. The others blow air around the brush which makes it hard for your hair to stay wrapped around the bristles while styling. The Conair one does not do that. It made a big difference in styling my hair. I would defintely buy this again (oh, wait! I already did!)."
5,This is the best thing that ever happened to my hair!,"I was looking for something... anything... that would work on my thick, course and unruly hair, that I've fought with all my life. I found this at such a great price on Amazon... over half or less than anywhere else... and it was a name brand as well. For such a small amount of money, I was definitely willing to take a chance.When I first turned it on, I thought that it didn't have anywhere near enough power to dry and style my hair from a dampened state, but I was very pleased to be very wrong! No more fighting with a round brush in one hand, while wielding a heavy hair dryer in the other hand.I will tell you that you do need a great haircut, in order to achieve your desired results. This appliance is wonderful, but it's not a miracle worker. Find a fantastic stylist and get your hair shaped in a way that you can work with it at home, using this item.If it worked for me, it will work for anyone. God Bless you Conair!!!"
3,"Doesn't curl, doesn't blow dry...kinda just halfway done.","It doesn't curl, but it will create a wave at ends. It doesn't blow dry quickly because high speed is equal to the lowest speed on a normal blowdryer. I'm not in love with it but it will work for occasional use, otherwise I would be really annoyed."
5,Conair round brush dryer,Love this product. Have been using this for years. My hair is slightly thick and curly. It styles my hair very nice and makes it manageable. Highly recommend this for people with coarse hair.
1,I Want My Money Back,"The whole reason I bought this item is because I spend half my time in London and half my time in Austin, and the product description claims the dual voltage makes it usable worldwide. I used it for two weeks in the States and it was fine. Once in the UK, I had to use a coin to turn the 'switch' to 250, which is pretty ridiculous, and which took way too much effort, as it was stuck. Once turned on, the tool lasted about one minute before it went dead. Now I'm back in the States, and the curler is in the trash as it no longer works here either. Money down the drain."
2,Disappointed,"I liked my curling combo for the week that it worked but was disappointed when it started power surging in irregular spurts, making it virtually useless. The company, Helen of Troy, is only open M-F and doesn't have voice mail or offer an online customer support option."
1,Defective,I normally don't write reviews but i am not happy with this product. There is some sort of glitch in the product to where it shuts off every time it is turned a certain way. It took me FOREVER to get my hair looking somewhat decent. Not worth the money. I bought a revlon air brush that works great instead.
5,Conair 2-in-1,"I recently experimented with this product while visiting my mom. I have shoulder length, layered hair that is fine with some wave to it. I work full time and can't get away without styling it everyday. However, I have two kids and prefer to spend as little time on my hair in the mornings as possible. I usually blow dry it and then flat iron it for a more finished look and to eliminate the frizz that inevitably accompanies the blow drying. The Conair 2-in-1 is a MIRACLE product. My hair is finished in less time and is definitely less damaged by this product. I love the use of hot air because it is so less damaging. The curl is just the right amount to style my layers and it lasts all day without losing its shape. I wish someone would have turned me on to this product years ago! I love it!"
1,no hot air,"I've returned this item (twice) as it did not work properly. When you use it and move your wrist, even slightly (so the cord twirls, as it's supposed to), the unit stops working."
5,Early,This product arrived early and this was great as we were traveling overseas and needed the 220 Volt setting. Thanks.
5,The greatest hair styler ever!!,"I have been using one of these for years, and was afraid when I couldn't find a new one at the my local stores. They are the best for out of control, frizzy, curly hair. They are also so easy to use."
2,Too little power for thick hair,"If you have thick hair, this product is not for you. I was very excited about the other reviews which said they could not do without this combo dryer/styler. I couldn't wait to try it. First of all, I found it very hard to handle due to the thickness of the handle. I have short, thick hair, and it was just too large to grasp the hair in the brush. Then there was the power....or lack thereof. I have an older model that generates 1000 watts. This newer version was about 300 watts. There was almost no blowing/drying power. It would have taken twenty minutes to dry my hair with this product. I tried twice to dry and style with it, realized it was never going to work, and returned it."
4,Are you a multitasker?,I am pleased with this product. It saves time on my hair and leaves one hand free to drink coffee or apply makeup.
3,Volume Series by Conair,"I bought this in Walmart at around $20. I am one those people that doesn't know how to use brush and blowdry at the same time. This tool is basically just a blowdryer with attached comb, which is great! I have long straight hair. It doesn't curl my hair nor create waves and volume as advertised but it makes my hair looks manageable. It doesn't have that much heat. It's fine with me coz I don't like curling my hair often. I just do it on special occasions. I have to dry my hair first with a regular blowdryer and use this to fix my hair. With just regular blowdryer, my hair would not look as good. I think this will work great with damp hair or a little wet hair. Tried it with dry hair, didn't work as much. I'm satisfied with it as I won't be holding brush and blowdry with my two hands anymore. But for curling my long hair, I'll use my regular curling iron for it."
1,Don't waste your money!,This is a really neat idea but within two weeks it just quit working! I was styling my hair one second and it was dead the next.
3,nice soft curls,I have had one of these for yrs. I love it. I need to get another.It is easy to use!!!
2,not all that impressive,"There are only 2 settings (Hi and Lo), and the power is very weak. the brush can't hold my thick hair, so it just feels like the thing is slipping around. i'm really not very impressed, and will probably never use it again. also, this item was much cheaper at my local drugstore."
5,Clairol brush,Awesome I love it Please do not stop making them!!!!I have had at least 6 of them !!!!
5,hair dryer,I love this hair dryer somebody bought for me about three years ago I found same one searching and searching about two weeks.... Thank you for old one to keep and product this....
5,Excellent product,"It is an excellente product, easy to use and with amazing results. I have a long hair and I always have problems let it ok at home. After this brush, I'm feeling good with my hair."
1,Power cuts off,"Bought this to replace fabulous and very old similar Conair model that was held together with rubber bands by the time I had to give up on it. Bought the current model but depending on how I was holding it, the power would cut out, then come on again, then cut out again. Took it back to the store and now have a replacement that does EXACTLY the same thing! WIll the third time be charm? Stay tuned."
5,Great as a straightner for wavy hair!,"I have owned 4 of these in the last 8 years...I love it!! I have naturally wavy hair and is a pain to sraighten with just a dryer: So, I dry it and straighten with this iron...It works like magic...I take it with me everywhere, it has become just as important as my blow-dryer. Dont leave home without it!"
2,very heavy,"I've had this brush for about a week, and wish I had kept looking. It's the size curl I want, but it is very, very heavy. My arms aren't terribly strong, so it's difficult to keep using it for more than a few minutes. I'll probably have to replace it fairly soon."
4,Great for my hair but...,"This was my first product of the kind. I loved the way this brush made my hair look! I have long, thick, curly hair but not ethnic and have always wanted a straighter style. Gave up on completely straight years ago. This makes my hair look great. It is still wavy but with less volume (as my hair gets big on its own), it actually reminds me of a models' hair for a shampoo commercial. Luxurious, shiny, smooth. Well, that is great except the thing only lasted 3 months. Two days after the last use, it just wouldn't turn on. I tossed it, irritated and searched for a different brand. Well, I just bought a Vidal Sassoon and it does not do a good job on my type of hair at all, it tangles easily and whenever I turn it off for a minute (to untangle my hair) it stops working for about 8 minutes. Needless to say, I can't stand it and am not sure what to get next..."
1,Waste of money,"I have short, fine hair. I have used a styling brush, with lots of bristle brushes, for years, just not this brand. Decided to give this one a try. This type of brush will not grasp short hair. Even with styling gel, I end up with a fluffy, frizzy mess. Could not give this thing away."
3,Love it but it's not built to last,"I really like this hot air brush - it takes awhile to blow dry my thick wavy hair but I love that I can use it one-handed and use the other hand to turn book pages or whatever. I get really frustrated trying to handle a round brush and a hair dryer so this one meets my needs. On the other hand, as others have mentioned, there seem to be some electrical problems with the product and I've gone through two of them. The first time the dryer slowly died and this time it just suddenly stopped working. Very frustrating. I don't think I'll buy this again and am on the lookout for a comparable product but of better quality."
2,Not enough power,"I bought this just a few weeks ago after my old air brush died. This one just doesn't have enough power. It doesn't blow hard enough or get hot enough for my thick, coarse hair."
1,Not so great!,"I just turned it on. The switch stopped working and now I can't turn it off... Good product but I guess I have bad luck, this is the first time It's happened to me. :("
4,It's Good.,"I like the way this works and the heat level seems fine to me. My mirror is a bit further away from the mirror that the cord likes to let me go, but other than cord length, this is a decent product."
1,Poor for Worldwide Travel,"This was described as dual voltage for worldwide travel. What is not stated is that it can be used only on the LOW setting in Europe. So the air flow is very low, and it takes forever to dry each curl."
2,Not enough power...,"This product might work well on fine to thin hair, although it does not have enough power to really dry or straighten thick hair. The highest setting is still not powerful enough. The brush doesn't get hot enough to straighten hair."
3,Good product for its short life,"It works as expected, but dies suddenly. I have had this item for exactly a year and i am now looking for a replacement. The previous one I bought also lasted about a year. If you don't mind buying a replacement every year, it is a great product for extra curly and difficult to style hair. I use it on wet and on dry hair and works defrizzes and styles nicely."
3,Not really what I wanted,"The product is good, just not what I was looking for. It makes blow drying and detangling your hair at one time convenient. I was looking more for a hot curling brush that will straighten my hair. This is really a good tool for blow drying hair and not straightening or curling hair. I have natural thick wavy hair and I was unable to curl my hair with this curling brush. The brush itself doesn't get really hot and blows out hot air like a hand held blow dryer."
2,Very short cord.,"I returned this styler after just a few uses because it gets VERY hot, even on the ""low"" setting, and the cord is very short. I don't recommend it as a hair dryer, styler, or anything! Look elsewhere."
2,Good thing it isn't expensive,"I loved mine, but I'm glad I didn't pay a lot of money for it. 6 months of use (not even daily) and it is DOA. I'm sad. I'm looking for a replacement now."
1,Conair curler only lasts 8 months,"This curling iron ""hot air styler"" worked fine for 8 months and then died. It is not the ground fault protector-- the reset clicks. The thing just doesn't go.Worked fine when turned off yesterday, but today I plug it in and nothing happens.This is the third one I have had. Will see how the 12 mo guarantee works...."
3,conair 11/2 hot combo dual volrage-too large,"I bought this to use overseas with its dual voltage feature. I found the 1 1/2"" barrel too large. the brush does not curl, it smooths. I wanted a curling iron with plastic teeth but need a 1"" or less to get a curl since my hair is shorter. Does anyone know a brand that is dual voltage air brush with a 1"" plastic tooth barrel????"
4,Conair 1-1/2-Inch Hot Air Curling Combo,"Works like it should on dry hair, however after a few minutes it begins to smell like the motor is going to burn out."
3,"Product is good, but not for me with short hair, non-multitasking ...","I have medium-short fine straight hair. The barrel on this device is huge! I get faster and better results by blow-drying then using a curlng iron.The device itself seems to work fine - and the results are kinda a big puffy effect, but not really curled on my hair.I like the review of the person who said she was a multi-tasker. IF I was sitting doing something else while doing my hair this might be the right device, but I do mine while standing in the bathroom and always while in a hurry."
2,"again, way too weak for blow styling my hair","I so wanted this to work but it didn't and I am out the money becuase of course, I opened the package to try it out. Maybe conair just has puny horsepower. This didn't do the job, and I am very sorry I bought it."
5,Curling Combo,"This Curling Combo is actually a blow dryer that curls while using it, and that is exactly what I had wanted. It is easy to use, does not dry out the hair like a curling iron. I can be used daily without any problems."
2,Afterwhile: A Secrets of a Woman's Heart,"The book ""Afterwhile"" did contain some juicy and revelaing stuff. But is was also full of typos and I found to be too full of characters whose profiles were not adequately developed. The author made a good attempt at organizing the book via the opening and closing with the letter to her friend. However, the table of contents suggested more insightful development of the plot or more spiritual development of the main character. Neither was achieved in my opinion. The author may have written an Iyanla Vanzant-style book of self disclosure, but she forgot to show adequate personal growth of the main character. Or perhaps the point is that the main character is still struggling with these issues. A good first try. Next time have a better proof reader and an exeperienced editor to strengthen what potentially could be a good book."
5,Spiritually Uplifting,"Afterwhile, provides that perfect seat on the roller coaster of life..gives you the strengh to reach back and account for the mountains and pitfalls that we all encounter in our self-evolution-Thank You, Thank You, This lesson of past and present has really sent me on a personal exploration of my own growth pains, and triumphs.. fictional or not this is the kind of story that everyone can read, laugh, cry, and remember...."
5,Essential for guitarists,"All the amature guitarists know the Recuerdos de la Alhambra, Jeux Interdits, Asturias. But there is almost never chance to be able to see and observe the level guitarist's hands (right & left) that play the Alhambra, Jeux Interdits, Asturias. Camera-man's angle choice is very good. Do you remember this DVD price is $29.95? In the world, on this earth, there is no guitar lesson like this for this price. And you can receive this guitar lesson until you will tire of this DVD. Amazon.com, thank you!"
5,Keep Making Music,"It is with great plesure that i listen to this extraordinary CD. The pictures the colors, the delivery,and the conseption are unic and amazing. It makes you realize how many placeses in the world remain undiscovert. I am convinced that Mr Tomaras is at the least a unique person and a visionary. It is with antisapation that i will await his next endevor"
5,He Got Game Score,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
1,retail plus,you can buy this at Trader Joes for $1.00 a bottle; this joker is asking $2.50 per bottle.
1,Overpriced bottled water,"This product is no better than any other bottled water brands name or simple tap water. First of all, Glaceau is distilled MUNICIPAL water. Second of all, buying this product for the sole reason that it is distilled water isn't very advantageous to your health or is a waste of money. Distilled water does more harm than good. Drinking distilled water for a long period will remove necessary electrolytes from your body such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and several trace elements that are absolutely necessary for your health. These deficiencies can cause irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure. So what if it contains electrolytes. The average person is not doing very strenuous activities that requires them to drinks with added electrolytes because he/she is profusely sweating out electrolytes onto skin. Water has naturally occurring electrolytes. Also, fruits and vegetable are good sources of electrolytes."
2,Vague and somewhat confusing,"I read this book as someone already familiar with the sport of Flyball. I found that it was a general overview of the sport as opposed to a training manual that would help you to teach a dog to play flyball. The training advice is somewhat vague and dated. Current training techniques are mentioned, but not explained for a novice to understand. This book utilizes the old method of pattern training and does not go into teaching or proofing the elements of the course. I found the book Flyball Training: Start to finish to be a much more thorough and concise guide of great use to the novice or experienced enthusiast."
4,Excellent overview of mineral economics and policy,"A valuable, if dated book, and an excellent value for only $29. You'd be hard pressed to find such a comprehensive overview of mineral economic and policy issues in another volume. This book will be most useful to government employees or academics working in the field of mineral economics and policy. Individuals in the private sector that are primarily interested in economic decision-making from the firm's point of view should look elsewhere.A few caveats: the book is an edited volume with contributions from different authors, which inevitably means that there is a fair bit of repetition; it is very focused on the United States - all examples relate to U.S. mining policy; a large number of the articles deal with the fossil fuels, which may not be apparent from the book's title."
5,The Creep who came in from the cold...,"This disc is awesome. Unlike most soundtracks, it can be listened to without any prior knowledge of the film. The music on disc one is very haunting while having some great rock feel. The second disc features the score by tomandandy. I just recently reviewed the last Midnight Syndicate CD and gave it a rather poor rating. The music on disc two is where they should be headed but they seem stuck inthis perpetual rut. If the guys in that band see my review on this album- PLEASE take note. The music is atmospheric and chilling. It is a little reminiscent of the the music produced for the X-Files but with a little more of an edge. tomandandy are a very underrated composing team. I wish they would get a little more credit as they can really convey mood and emotion very well in their scores."
5,Captures the Film Perfectly!,"Low and King Black Acid so an amazing job caputure the vieb of the film. Both bands use hauntingly beautiful and etheral textures. King Black Acid really shines in a 70s Pink Floyd sorta way. Feels like ""Dark Side of The Moon"" or ""Wish You Were Here"" era stuff, but without sounding retro or dated.The score disc is nice to get in the same set. These are the guys who did JFK and Natural Born Killers for Oliver Stone, so it's cool too."
4,* very strong soundtrack..,"it very important to have a score that fits the mood of the film; this is all the more important when you have a horror or thriller type movie, because the music / sound / score creates much of the mood the viewer is experiencing. It's not just the visuals on the screen. It's a combination of image, lighting, and sound.The Mothman Prohecies is a great film, made even better by the joiint efforts from Low, Tomandandy, and King Black Acid. Together, these three artists create ""mood music"" that fits right in with the movie.watch the movie, and buy this soundtrack!"
4,Good Soundtrack,This soundtrack contains a good array of songs. It is a 2-CD soundtrack and I enjoyed it more than the movie.
3,Better idea...,"How about ditch the songs that have nothing to do with the movie, and put it on one cd so that it's more worth buying? I've been wanting this soundtrack for a long time, but discovering it's a 2-cd affair with irrelevant music really doesn't impress me."
2,Lifeless,"Moroney gives a lifeless rendition of these pieces. Too often they sound mechanical-sewing machine Bach. His playing sounds to me as if he is more of a musicologist than a musician, although he is clearly highly technically proficient. I'm afraid to me he all too rarely displays qualities over and above mere techical proficiency.Don't buy it!"
3,Quality not as promised,"Keen Newport sandals are great for the most part. Good fit, comfortable and versatile.I purchased one <6months ago and used it twice - a beach trip and a hiking trip and i followed the care instructions afetr both the trips. I noticed yesterday that the stitches seem to be coming off on the backstrap. I am definitely going to contact Keen to let them know and see how they can help me.(i will keep you posted)I am disappointed with the quality of stitches. A footwear designed mostly for rugged outdoor type of usage should not have this issue."
5,great go any where sandal,"Third pair of these and the other two pairs lasted 3 hard year each. Hiking, beaches, boating and around all summer. Wet or dry they are great and give good support to my arthritic feet."
3,Keen Newport size issue,"Although I believe that Keen is one of the better sandals out there, the sizing issue is a problem. Several Keen buyers have expressed the same complaint to me. I sent these back for the next size up. After paying for shipping on the second pair, and yes, I'm a prime member, but still have to pay, the second pair fits snug, but acceptable. Overview is that the Keen size issue coupled with Amazon's poor service lowers the overal rating on these shoes for me..."
4,cool and comfortable,"Nice pair of sandals, ok price, easy to wear, put on and take off. Well constructed and of very good quality."
5,Great Sandals!,"I have had these sandals for 2 months now and they still look great. I wear sandals all the time during the summer. The cheap sandals I have been buying from Walmart rarely last more than a month. I drive a truck for a factory and all I do is spot trailers, so there is a lot of climbing up and down out of the truck. These are the first pair of sandals I have found that could take the punishment. Not to mention that they are probably the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn. Keen Newport Sandals are worth every penny and then some. When I wear these out, I will definitely buy more!"
5,Great shoe/sandal.,I got the sandals because they come in wide sizes and they protect the toes. They are comfortable and very durable.
3,"Keens - look good, feel good, smell awful",I have been blessed with feet that do not sweat much... and generally stinky shoes are not a big problem.I got some Keen Taos sandals- my sis in law bought the newports...Both of us have discovered... they get a distinctive fungal funk within a few times of wearing them.Ordinary laundering does not remove the odor. I finally used an enzyme for cleaning septic taks. It diminished the odor about 85% - but still did not totally eliminate it.
3,Great but smelly,"WOW! I just don't know what to say about these sandals. My husband and I bought our first pair of Newport Keens in Las Vegas in June. The comfort was great but both noticed that our feet smelled bad. Well, getting home we have been wearing them. My husband wears them every day and his feet smell so bad that he has to go and wash his feet right away. My Keens would do the same, but I tend to not wear them because of the smell. My husband and I normally do not have smelly feet and it is shocking how bad the Keens make you smell. I have currantly written the Keen company to see if there is anything we can do, but it is too soon to hear back from them. I just can't stand the smelly feet but I do love the look and feel of the Keens. I probably would have never had boughten them if I would have known this. I hope this helps others and I hope Keen is aware of this problem."
1,Comfortable but poor quality,Mine is of very poor quality. Had the sandals for just over a year. Probably less than 5 months of use during Canadian summers.Now the stitches are coming off in two locations [...]). I expected the sandals to last longer than than.
2,Unhappy camper,"I so-o wanted these to work for me as they are stylish and rugged. Unfortunately, they were too narrow for my regular 10.5 foot. (A Keen lace-up of that size fits me perfectly!) They also felt stiff regardless of how much I tried to break them in. Further, as the insole is designed for draining away water, it was not as comfortable as I would have liked for normal wear on the streets or gentle trails."
5,Great shoes,"I wear these every day, perfect for warm climes. Great traction and while cool as sandals provide all-important toe protection- wouldn't want to rip a toenail off on the Bangkok pavement. The shiitake/Bombay Brown color combination is my favorite so far in this line."
1,They did not open box to see if correct product was put in it,When I opened the box . The box had everything correct on it. They had put wrong style shoe and color shoe in the box . Now I have to return them. : (
4,Good,"This is the second pair of these I own. It might be best to buy a half size larger than your regular size to ensure a comfortable fit. I don't recall my first pair needing to be broken in but these are my actual size and the right side is a bit too snug. Otherwise, looks are impressive and they're very strong."
5,KEENly Addictive...,Love wearing this everyday which I bought a year ago. Can't wait for it to wear out that I bought another Newport H2!
5,Versatile and comfortable,"These sandals never left my feet during a trip to Maui. Used them everywhere from walking the storefronts in Lahaina, to walking in the surf, to hiking up to Waimoku falls in a muddy downpour- every situation they performed excellently. Being such an enclosed sandal, don't expect them to be as airy as a conventional sandal, but they are a good compromise between foot support, water sport and foot comfort."
1,Many missed opportunities,"As a former resident of Newport, I'm familiar with many locations listed in this book. As a pictorial book, this one misses the mark. The photography is bad, and the lighting is glaringly terrible. Some locations, such as the Slocum estate, are ruined by lighting so yellow that colors are distorted. Another odd thing is the way the photographer loves floors. The photograph of the entry inside Marble House, for example, devotes approximately 50% of it's space to the floor. The photographer does this many times. Look at the cover of the book. Have you ever seen a photo of The Breakers like this? The floor of the patio takes up 50% of the photo. The house itself?............not even 25% of the cover. Odd, to me at least."
1,Choose This Toy Wisely!!!,"I let my 3-year old pick this toy out for his birthday. Boy, what a mistake! This toy is not for the younger child (unless he/she is being raised as part of a pit crew for Nascar). My son was bewildered when this interactive car started barking out ""change the front tires... we are going to lose the race!"" What made it worse was the irritating voice kept repeating this phrase until its demands were met! Another point to make about this toy is that even though it is made of durable plastic, the car has a really tough time making its way across any kind of carpet.Overall, this toy may be great for the older race car enthusiast but I would skip it for a younger child. And I would definitely re-think the choice if carpet is on your floor! It's not the loss of front tires that makes this car lose races... it's the fact the car has NO POWER to get across the finish line!Do yourself a favor & skip this one... I am now having to make a trip to the store to return this thing!"
4,"Then, There Was Iron","I thought this novel was a very intelligent read. I think that you must have a higher than average IQ to understand the depth that Miss Barton has written on. Obviously some people are not on that level and therefore do not understand this novel, making it boring as in the words of ""Mitchell."" As for ""coming out"" to her family...Miss Barton has been out of the closet for approx. 15 years. I know this because I have logged onto her website (http://www.thentherewasiron.com) and corrosponded directly with her.Clarice"
4,Intelligent,"Then, There was Iron, is a wonderful read. It is filled with interesting characters and anticipation. It is a stimulating mix of fact, fiction and the human spirit.Iron, the main character, is an admirable woman, being motivated by self-acceptance and love. She is born into slavery as a breeder, although she does not go through the physical torment as the other characters, she does suffer. She is a lesbian and above all a giver. The slave dialect in the book, is what makes it so believable. The story takes you through her struggle to freedom. Along the way, you experience, birth, death, multiple personality disorder, relationships, the underground railroad and drug addition.A must read! I eagerly await part 2 (especially Iron and Chloe's reunion)."
1,"Boring, and Revealing","As an Afro-Canadian, and therefore the decendants of slaves, Ellen Barton not only allows her readers to take a glimpse into her past, but informs her audience that she herself is a lesbian. With the help of her lover Chloe/Lisa, Ellen informs her family of her ""true self"", somethiing she could not freely admit. Overall, the book is an interesting read, however, other than the fact that the writer decides to ""come out of the closet"" Then, There Was Iron does not differ in any significant way than any other book written for that era."
4,Good reference book,Very thoroughly written. Some sections come in very handy during SICU rotations. The concepts are explained in a plain easy to read format.
4,icu book,"the book has excellent summaries of pathophys behind what we see/diagnose/measure/do in the icu. the book does have significant drawbacks, though, namely that it is highly biased towards the author's occasionally contraversial opinions. my attendings (all critical care experts) have debated some of his recommendations. also, with the most recent version published in 1997 (and knowing that the acutal revisions were probably done a year or so before that) the book is 5 years behind the times.in summary, good book for basics, for understanding how and why, for explanations of procedures and basic protocol. be wary of marino's unusual recommendations. be aware of more current recommendations. use other references as well for broader picture."
3,"Good, but First Edition Better","Good book for the fundamentals and the physiology behind the patient care. As a critical care MD, I learned alot form the book during my training, however like another reviewer, I found this edition too long. The first edition (much shorter, and the one I learned from and want back) is much better and about half the pages."
4,When the doctor is not around! (hhhhmmm!),I first found this book while working on Maui and have used it religiously ever since. It is always in my bag that I take to work. I have been working in ICU since 1995 and have learned so much from this book alone. If your an ICU RN and do not own this book....get one! Its worth every cent.
4,"FUN, FUN, FUN","My family loves this CD. The music is not necessarily the best, but what fun! We all sing along. It is simple and catchy and we have a great time with it. My 4 year old loves ""Nearly Missed a Rainbow"" (Elmo with Rosie O'Donnell), my 11 year old loves ""I Love Trash"" (Aerosmith with Oscar the Grouch). I love it all. It brings back so many memories, but at the same time appeals to the kids in a very modern way."
1,This CD will not help your child advance her or his knowledg,There is too much RAP on this CD! Rap is the rhythm and background music of too many negative forces of our society to he something you would want to get your child to like. YUK!
2,I am not impressed.,I was expecting something different. I haven't even used it at my day care center yet. Maybe the children will enjoy it better than myself.
4,To be continued,This plant arrived in excellent condition and was beautiful. It was planted this yr so I will let you know how it does next yr. I have ordered from this company several times and have been exceptionally happy by the condition the plants arrive and how healthy the plants are. They have delivered to my parents as well and they couldn't be happier with the plants.
3,bad luck inside the home,"folklore says bleeding hearts bring bad luck when grown inside the home, so always keep the plant outside. it is a beautiful plant with small flowers that droop over it's pot. i love charming looking flowers so i find them hard to resist. if i get them i may have to hold off ordering until mid-march so it arrives right before april, when it is safe from outside frost.my old neighbor had some, each flower is around the size of a penny and there are multiple flowers in a row per stem."
5,Jane's shining debut album,"I am ver much impressed with the debut CD from Jane Wiedlin.Jane's music is fun and up beat and very catchy.There is not one bad song on this whole CD.Songs like ""Blue Kiss"",""Sometimes You Really Get On My Nerves"",""Goodbye Cruel World"",and ""I Will Wait For You"" are songs that should have been pop hits.It's a shame that Jane didn't have a good of solo career as Belinda Carlisle.Her music is just as good and catchy as hers.If you ever find a copy of this CD grab it cuz you probably won't find another copy of it.This a must have for anyone who loves the Go-Go's or pop music."
4,solo from the Go-Go's,another hard to find album. Good rocking from a solo from one of the classic girls bands of R-N-Roll. (The Go-Go's)
4,Good creative pop music,"With the difficulty I had finding this (not available on iTunes), I was glad to see the CD was still available on Amazon. This was Jane's first post-GoGo release and my favorite of hers. Edgier in places than her old band, great songs. Had it on vinyl for years and I'd forgotten how good it is."
4,classic Bobby,This cd and MCA GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2 are not only the best stuff he ever did but both have running times of over 70 minutes.
1,NOT NATURAL,"Unfortunately amazon doesn't list the real ingredients in what's in the bottle. If you check other places online you'll see that it's actually dl-alpha Tocopheryl Acetate instead of d-alpha, if it's dl it means that it's synthetic and research shows that the synthetic isn't as good to use topically and not at all good for you if ingested."
3,interesting,"These are some interesting points here about bad things happening to good people. I really think this is probably one of the most troubling subjects from our emotional stand point. Fortunately for us, God offers numerous answers to comfort us in these times. Here are a few other points you might consider adding to your discussion of this topic at [...]"
4,Miniature In Appearance But a Giant Inside.,"Whether religious or not, this book will provide readers with answers they need to be able to share an explanation of the different factors behind the benefit and purpose of adversity.Melvin Tinker, the author, is well and widely read in the various disciplines he writes about. His masterful ability to convert scripture into understandable plain language makes his work even more believable and trustworthy.You will find this book fascinating in a sense that it ministers unto the quietness of your spirit.For those who may find this work inadequate, and seek more thought provoking lessons, then Rabbi Harold Kushner's ""When Bad Things Happen To Good People"" may serve as a good fill in the blanks book to compliment this one."
1,Why do Bad Things Happen,"The book was written poorly. It was a mixture of commentary, biblical passages,and poorly drawn conclusions. There are much better texts that are clearly written as to why bad things happen to good people. I do not recommend this book."
3,Train Trip Entertainment,"Our 7 year old granddaughter was given this book for entertainment while taking a train trip. She enjoyed placing the stickers in the book, but that didn't take much time for her to complete. She turned to other forms of entertainment for the trip, i.e. writing in a journal, playing cards, and dressing her American Doll."
1,Waste of money.........,Harry has a Snow Owl. Harry has a Firebolt broom. Just who and what are some of the people and symbols shown? It would have been nice to have had labels on each item. The author would not have approved of this item.
5,Great Shoe!,"I'm a teacher and walk, shuffle, and stand all day. I have worn these shoes since Sept. 2, 2009 and it's now May 17, 2010. I only have 2 weeks of school left, so these shoes got through an entire school year. I will be buying a second pair this summer for the 2010-2011 school year. Incredible comfort! The sole has worn flat in high pressure areas but that's to be expected... I recommend these shoes!"
2,"Comfortable, but..","soles started wearing down fairly quickly.at the 1 year mark they were nearly slick on the bottom, this after wearing them about 2-3 times a week. i won't put them on when it's rainy outside because stepping in any amount of standing water is like hitting an oil slick.won't buy these again"
4,"Great looking, great comfort, for a decent price.","I bought this pair of Dockers for the same reason most people do...they look good. When you buy shoes online, you don't always know exactly what you're going to get. When I received them and put them on, I was very pleasantly surprised! I purchased these as my work shoes. I work a cushy office job, where I sometimes have to perform light physical labor. These shoes are comfortable for both! The only thing I can say that would even be partially negative, is that I may have been able to get away with buying a 1/2 size smaller. The shoes are just a little loose for me, and I bought the same size I normally do. That's actually good, though, if I decide to add some shoe cushions, or wear thicker socks."
5,Dockers Glacier,I saw this shoe in a store but they never have my size (8 wide) so I order them from Amazon. It fits great and is very comfortable. Looks to be well made and should last a long time but only time will tell.
5,very comfortable good value,I like my shoes comfy - these felt good after wearing afew hours. Great price and a great value too.
4,Nice shoes!,"I bought the shoes for my husband. This is his third pair of Dockers shoes. He has been pretty satisfied with it. Overall, he is happy about the order.If there is any cons we could think of, I will say that the shoes might not be that breathable. So you could have sweaty feet sometimes."
4,great and comfortable,"a very comfortable shoe. it's great for the wall/winter weather. very nice to drive in as well, unlike most wintery shoes."
3,"Comfortable, but soles wear down fast","I really like the comfort of these shoes, but the soles wore down to completely smooth in no time. I still wear them because I haven't found anything as comfortable to replace them, but not happy with how quicly they wore down."
2,"Moderately comfortable, Terribly fast wearing","The comfort level of these shoes is neither great nor poor, just average. What does stick out however is shoe life. These shoes lasted less than six months, where I usually get 12-18 months out of a pair of timberlands or Doc Martens. The insole wore through in about two months and and the tread was worn completely flat at the end of six months. The laces continually shifted to one side. Overall, not impressed at all. Now wearing a pair of Cabelas house brand oxfords that are head and shoulders better."
4,Nice shoe,"looks really good, nice insoles. The only issue is the out-soles, have worn them for a week, mostly on rocks and they dont look like they will last. The reason is that it is soft rubber, which is comfortable. Perfect for the city."
4,Potent but soothing,"If you like the sound of a Native American flute (as was heard in the song ""Colors of the Wind,"" from Disney's ""Pochahontas""), then you will enjoy anything done by Burning Sky.Add to it (among other instruments) percussion, acoustic guitar, rattles and rainsticks, and the unique sound of the Aboriginal didjeridu, and you'll want to own ""Creation."""
2,Photoshop Elements 3 for Dummies,I must need elements 3 for total idiots. This was just not that helpful.
2,Disappointing for a Dummies' Book,"I usually find the Dummies' books very helpful and useful. But this one didn't measure up. The attempts at levity and humor became intrusive and trite. It would have been very helpful if, as they introduced a particular feature or tool, the authors would have begun by telling the reader what you'd likely want to use that tool or feature for. Disappointing. I'll find something better."
3,The Lollipop tree and a few other children's favourites,"I bought this CD for Burl Ives' version of The Lollipop Tree for the sole enjoyment of my three year old daughter. I have listened to it several times with my daughter and going on her feedback we skip through about half.The recordings are of generally good quality, ranging from 1949 to 1965.Given Burl Ives extensive catalogue it is a slightly strange compilation of tunes and some of them seem out of place on ostensibly a children's CD, ie Cowboy's Lament and Wee Cooper of Fife."
2,It's called 'Lost Paradise',It's very unique in that it plays at 33 or 45 and sounds excellent at both. And it's called 'Lost Paradise'
5,"Review of :Be Nice to Spiders""","I remember reading this book to my daughter, who is now 39 ! I purchased it for my adopted grandaughter, who is 11. She read it after having a hysterical fit about seeing a spider in the garage. Now she understands why spiders are important."
4,Why does it always have to be happily ever after,"Published in 1967, it is slightly dated but this almost adds to it's charm.The story is simple with the moral that everything is useful and has a place in the world.The ending annoyed me a little bit and I will quote the last page.""And Billy was right. A few days later, out of the egg sac came lots of little spiders.From then on, Helen and her children and all the animals in the Zoo lived happily ever after""Anyone who has read Charlotte's Web will know that once Helen has that little egg sac she is not long for this world! Ok, I know, my daughter is only two but I don't believe in always teaching her happily ever after, what is wrong with a bit of realism."
5,charming vintage story about a spider at the zoo,"Billy is moving to an apartment that doesn't allow pets, so he leaves his beloved spider Helen at the zoo, where she promptly improves everyone's lives by eating all those annoying flies. Things are great until the head of the zoo sends out a misguided order to clean up the zoo --including those spider webs. This is a great book about unexpected and mutually beneficial relationships, and is good for bug lovers and haters alike.First printed in 1967, this book's illustrations have a definite vintage feel to them."
5,Converted Hip-Hop Lovers Or Anyone who love Hip-Hop.,This CD will Bliss your Soul if you are Save or Not Save.
5,Rob's works are truly art ... his book ... an appetizer,"The magic and mystery of the Kingdom Lo, high in the Himalayan Mountains of Nepal on the border with Tibet ... this is as close as you can get without being there. More than a coffee table book, this book won't let you rest until you have stood and gazed upon the majesty which provoked the works. Rob's works are on display at the Smithsonian through September 26."
2,Could have been great,"The mockumentary style is very entertaining. The cgi sequences are great, but there aren't enough of them. The ending completely falls apart and sullys the whole experience. I suspect they wanted to do the final scenes in cgi, but ran out of money.A good movie to fast forward to the fun parts."
3,dumb fun but slower than molasses,"Shot like a Spinal Tap-ish documentary on this man who transforms into an extremely large man to fight Japan's various monsters (and we're not talking Gamera, Gozdilla and Mothra) who all are these funky artistic creations from the mind of Hitoshi Matsumoto who wrote, directed and starred in this.The movie is let down mainly by its pacing which is far too slow and the lead actor. I think in better hands this would have been a hoot. Never been a huge fan of Matsumoto as a comedian in Japan anyway. He's no Tunnels, Tamori or Beat Takeshi. Then again who is?The extras include a full one-hour making of. Are they serious? Edit that thing down!"
2,At last: Peace in Japan,"A mix of animation and live actions, reality and fiction, people and monsters, the movie hides its sense too deep beneath the screened as for this ordinary viewer while superhero resurrecting victoriously after being steadily beaten by out-of-this-world-destroyers was finally somehow spirited away by good monsters establishing a peace on the Earth-in this Japanese location definitely.A very short work allows recalling afterwards as much as buggy suits of characters revel."
3,Blood may tell...but book doesn't do that well...,"Parts of this true crime book were terrific. Particularly the parts about the investigation and the narrative about the life of the Fitzhugh family. However, the last part of the book is a snooze. Smith, who seems to have a talented background, basically gives us trial transcripts for about 100 pages or so, including the DNA evidence. The narrative disappears and is enough to put me to sleep (as it did a few times). The story here could have been told in much more engaging way--transcripts are not that interesting. Also, where was the epilogue? What happened? We know Fitzhugh is convicted, but what about his kids? Bob Brown? What happened to these people? We don't know. Instead, we get some dime story philosophy and a look at Del Mar. Who Cares? There was a much better book to be written on this fascinating case."
3,a bit slow and not as many 'surprises' as the cover says,"I found this book a bit slow and tedious compared to writings by other true crime writers like Ann Rule and Jerry Bledsoe. The author reveals from the first chapter that Ken is in prison so the book never builds any anticipation as to whether the police will build a case against him. The most interesting thing about the whole book is the eerie similarities to the Michael Peterson case going on right now in NC which is being televised on CourtTV. Actually, that case is more interesting, skip the book."
1,No End Book,"I cannot believe that Amazon charged for this book. I want my money back. The writer never wrote how the trial ended. I had to google the answer. He just stops writing the book during the killer's trail and we are left to wonder what happened. Either the author just got tired of writing or had another more important project to go to but I have never seen a book that just stops period. The writer also never goes into the characters of the main players. The murdered wife's personality is never delved into, even tho she carried on an 8 yrs. affair under the husbands nose and bore her lover's child. Very shallow robot like book."
3,Pretty good one,"This was a pretty good book. I have read better books by Carlton Smith, but it was still worth my time. The husband is so irritating, you can't put it down wanting to see just what he is going to come up with next!"
5,Was just as advertised........ Great!!!,Its nice to feel confident when ordering from Amazon...knowing that the item will be shipped as stated and arrive just as advertised.Keep up the great work gang....Don
1,Shrek The Halls,"I was really disappointed in what I thought was a movie but turned out to be a 20 minute cartoon with no ending. Very disappointed, I thought it was going to be a Christmas movie."
3,Funny but short,This was a really short movie that would have been worth the money if it were longer. It was funny and enjoyable for the kids but it would have been better as a full-length.
3,Cute Ty Plush,"The Movie was quite short, but entertaining for the little ones big and small . The plush was nice 2!!!"
4,Shrek the Halls,"Just an enjoyable movie for all ages - both very young, young and the elderly. Thoroughly recommended."
3,Shrek the Halls,"A very cute but short DVD. It wasn't quite what I expected, but the children enjoyed it very much. A little pricey."
3,"The movie itself is good,length is terrible","I, like many others who have left recommendations think that the length of this movie for the price is horrible. The movie itself is great though,the shrek that we have come to enjoy in all the previous movies. The innuendos are great. Good movie but length of 22 minutes is terrible, like many children's dvds."
2,"not long enough for the price, no matter where you buy it","My grandkids LOVE Shrek and were more disappointed than I at how short this movie was, virtually no substance to it at all. Save your $$"
3,As Fun as the first 2 Shrek Movies,"Sadly for a short animated special, Shrek the Halls is better than Shrek the 3rd. I mean where were these writers when that movie was being made ?It has the same humor that made the first and 2nd movies good. Plus, thank god there's no sign of the unfunny Artie (Justin Timberlake). Hopefully they get Shrek 4 right, like they got this right. Hopefully they leave out Artie as well! The only bad thing about Shrek the Halls is that it isn't longer. It's only a half hour."
2,A Bit Expensive for 22 minutes,Shrek the Halls (Widescreen Edition)As usually Shrek keeps you laughing. I purchased this movie expecting over an hour of entertainment. I was disappointed when it ended in 22 minutes. I guess it's my fault for not reading the package before buying the DVD; but I figured for the price that it had to be full length. The kids loved it and will watch it over and over. Would have been nice if it were longer.
1,Not worth the money,The movie is really funny but it is not worth the money for a 20 min dvd. This dvd should be half the cost.
1,$17.99 for 22 minutes of Shrek? Are you out of your mind?,"And what's going to be horrible is so many little kids are going to be begging Mommy and Daddy for this, and with that little thing called ""a major recession"", this will go back on the shelf. Santa will not be delivering this item to many kids this year... Shame on whoever decided on this price."
1,Save your money!,"We love the Shrek movies, but this one doesn't come close. I say save your money. It's not worth the price."
1,Shrek bombed Christmas,"This was the most disappointing movie ever. My children received this movie as a gift from Grandma and last night we finally had some time to watch it. We had no idea that it was only 22 minutes long. Prepared for a long lasting Shrek filled evening, popcorn and all, we snuggled up and hit play. We laughed and laughed...and then it was over. Just like that. Our night abruptly cut short. Needless to say, as soon as the credits rolled my middle daughter (a huge Shrek fan) started crying. My husband and I just looked at each other as if waiting for the punchline. After a minute or two we realized that maybe this was it. He slowly got off the couch, retrieved the jacket, and read the length on the back. Twenty-two minutes. We quickly popped a different movie in and prayed the kids would move past the moment. They did, but unfortunately my daughter will remember the night that Shrek bombed Christmas."
2,DVD $ is a RIP-OFF,"1st off, Shrek The Halls itself is hilarious! Very well done, probably better material than what was in the 2nd & 3rd films. My gripe is absolutely with the dvd itself & its pricepoint. $17.99 (or $19.99 retail)for only 22 MINUTES worth of cartoon is an absolute rip-off!According to other online outlets, here is the list of features:12 Days of Christmas FeaturetteDeck the Halls FeaturetteGingy Dunking GameShrek Carnival Craze Video Game Demo & Cheat CodeThat's it?! Sorry but I say just save your loot & rec'd it when ABC shows it 2-3 times this Holiday season. The cartoon is good but it ain't that good!"
4,"Price not so good, but....","The $17.99 for 22 minutes isn't good, but it being in a Widescreen version is worth it. Besides, how many more times will ABC broadcast it; and when it comes on and I record it, it won't be widescreen."
1,Not worth $17,"This will be shown on ABC and ABC Family numberous times between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Yes, it is very funny and fits with the other Shrek films, it's just that at 22 minutes, it's not worth the price. This should have been an addition to a rerelese of the Shrek films and not a separate release by itself."
4,In the mornin' I'm makin' waffles!,"Positive:1. Animation is outstanding, as usual and as with all the Shrek movies.2. Fairly strong story and concept3. Funny and entertaining4. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Donkey5. Fairytale creatures are explored and really add depthNegative:1. Too short- 22 minutes2. Too expensive, but if you buy it from the New and Used section, it is worth it3. TOO EXPENSIVE! (Worth mentioning twice)"
1,22 minutes = $17.99 ???,"Saddest thing is, what percentage of people will check the details of the DVD online or at stores. I predict alot of upset people when the movie ends abrubtly!!!"
3,"Liked it on TV, but unnecessary scary Santa scene",There was a scary scene with Santa and Gingey that pretty much ruined an otherwise enjoyable and authentically Shrek video. Really little ones will be completely confused and possibly frightened by it.
2,Shrek the halls,"Great video except for the fact that it only went for 22 minutes!!!!! i thought that it was expensive for such a short video (if you can call it a video!) after i watched the 22 minutes video, which was great, the kids and adults loved it, i thought maybe they would have more special features to make up for it, nope. a few song a short game thats it....."
2,Too Short for the $ but HYSTERICAL Classic Shrek,"It is Shrek after all...so of course well made, hysterical and a must have...but for $9 on iTunes why pay this price + shipping? It is only 22 minutes long but a must have in SOME format for any Shrek fan..."
2,Suck the halls,Oaky the movie itself was not that bad it is shrek after all so it has to be good. I was looking forwarded to adding this to the other movies for a complete shrek collection. But I felt the story was rushed and should have been extended to make it worthy of the other movies & worth paying for. I got it on sale for $13.99 and even that was TOO much to pay for only a 22min show! It should have been cheaper or the movie should have been longer.
1,22 Minutes for $20+ - Total Rip off!,"Ok Movie, but a total ripoff for 22 minutes of movie. I was left wondering... where's the rest of the DVD?? Should have been more like $3-4!!! Don't waste your money!"
4,"Rate the MOVIE, not the Price!","This is a wonderful, family-friendly holiday movie, and best of all -- it's SHREK!! I just can't watch this or any Shrek movie without laughing out loud at the antics of Shrek, Donkey & Puss in Boots. Please make sure you read reviews of the movie when making your decision about watching/purchasing. This is not the forum for complaints about pricing. If you're a Shrek fan, as it seems most of us are, don't kill the movie's rating because you disagree with the studio's pricing policy."
2,This ain't Martyn's original bluesy stuff,"Don't make the same mistake as a friend of mine who bought this CD thinking it was the original versions of John Martyn's songs. The originals are more raw, bluesy, wandering and evocative. Maybe you like this better. I didn't. To each his own, (but know what you're getting)."
1,LIMP RE-MAKES of once-wonderful music,"If you are a fan, do NOT buy this album! If you want to find out more about John Martyn and think that a greatest-hits type album is the way to go--do NOT buy this album!! There are some wonderful songs here that were once played and sung with real passion, but are now so slickly over-produced that it squeezes the life out of them. I don't know why Mr. Martyn agreed to re-record this music since the originals were so good--maybe it was legal. It's a travesty.Buy ""Grace and Danger,"" or ""Glorious Fool,"" but NOT this garbage. What a shame."
5,Good information for scouting area with a limited amount of time to hunt.,I found the book to be an outstanding resource for help on scouting areas you aren't familiar with. I saved me a great deal of time in a recent hunt to an area I hadn't hunted before.
5,VERY WELL WRITTEN,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ ON HOW TO AND WHERE TO HUNT BUCKS.IF YOU CAN'T LEARN FROM THIS BOOK THAN YOUR EGO HAS GOTTEN IN THE WAY, BECAUSE I DON'T CARE IF YOUR A NOVICE OR SEASONED HUNTER YOU CAN DIFFENTLY PICK UP TACTICS ON WHERE TO HUNT IN THE WOODS BY READING THIS BOOK. A MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION"
3,Students of Advertising: Come hither,"This is a good example of a real master at work. I connect more with his black and white portraits more than anything else in the book. He's the best at what he does and it's a damn shame that he's fallen off the radar screen. This is a reprint edition. The pictures lack a timelessness which keep them grounded in commerce. If you are studying advertising, check this guy out. Hiro studied with some of the best and it shows. You can learn a lot from Hiro."
3,Cookware set,"The pots are really adorable, and our daughter is playing a lot with them, but the lids chip easily. We had chips the very first day!"
2,"Cute, but NOT durable!","My girls loved these pans. However, the enamel chipped the first day we had them. I have found little bits of painted chipped enamel in my girls' playroom & in my 11-month-old's mouth! Needless to say, we have had to put these away. I was so sad to do this because they were so cute. I will definitely look for a nice stainless steel or wooden cookware set in the future."
1,rip off,all of these DVD's are compilations of public domain videos available to anyone for free. Save yourself some money and get them yourself (for free)
5,Sadly Overlooked,These guys were (are) great! I think the mistake in promoting them was filing them in a new age category. This is really progressive music. Very Tony Banks influenced keyboards. I enjoyed the vocal work as well. The second Exchange CD was equally as good (this was the third and last). Too bad they aren't still together. Wonder what happened to those guys?
1,Old jokes -- save them for the Rat Pack,"This book is published in 2000, but the jokes all read like they're from the 1950's. These jokes are insipid. Do yourself a favor and find something better. I'm returning my copy."
1,Did not enjoy this!,"Well I have no problem with Romance Alive Audio's abridged audio cassettes I have listened to plenty that I have liked but I didn't like The Tea Planter's Bride, not because it was abridged, but because the story was just not enjoyable I didn't like the creepy plot involving the evil, perverted villain! Anyway I'm glad I only listened to a very abridged audio cassette and I didn't listen to an unabridged audio cassette or read the book!"
2,Not her best effort,"I love to read Rosemary Rogers stories, especially the Steve and Ginny books, but Celia and Grant were no Steve and Ginny. They didn't even get to have sex till the very end of the book. Celia annoyed me through most of the book. She was always so angry, usually at Grant. Especially if there was another female in the room batting her eyelashes at him. The story got more interesting once they were in Ceylon, but instead of Grant and Celia working as a team, Celia was still at odds with him and it took away from the story. By that point they should have been together and they weren't.I'm glad I bought the book used. I would have been better off getting it from the library."
3,"Not Rosemary Rogers Best Book, but still readable!","This was not one of Ms. Rogers best books, but it was still an okay read. Rosemary Rogers has written so many great books and she should not be judged by this one! This book was good but not great."
3,Not Lebron Brother's best.,"For those of us that have listened Lebron Brothers hard hitting, raw salsa know how great their music can be. Unfortunately this album although has glimpses of just that, fails to consistently deliver. It includes several great tracks such as: ""El Nuevo Amanecer"", ""Tengo Testigo"" and ""La Memoria"" that has their distinctive raw, unpolished sound. ""La Memoria"" is the clearly the standout track with its great trumpets and overall salsa dura. The rest of the album goes downhill. It includes some filler salsa tunes, anglo disco-ish tracks, which they usually recorded and a merengue. I would have to rate this one down the middle and give it 2.5 stars as it has very little amount of quality songs. very disappointing for me."
5,Rosie rocks!,"I bought this album immediately after seeing Rosie in concert. She was the support act for Jewel, and I was just blown away when I heard her voice. This album does not fail to disappoint - Rosie has an amazing voice. The album has an acoustic feel to it - it's simplicity is part of the reason it is so good. Her lyrics are soulful and melodious - ranging from the upbeat ""Two dollar shoes"", to the beautifully sung ""October"". I just love this album - I'm sure you will too!"
2,"OK on specific nutrients, poor overall plan","A nice touch to let me know what ginko is and what it does, but poor on the overall plan. I wanted something that would say ""if you walk this much, weigh this much, eat this..."" I got a few ideas, not much of a roadmap."
4,Early Day Miners,"The Early Day Miners do sound distinctively like Low, but their album still is, to me, one of those albums you have to be in the right mood for in order to be able to enjoy it. Extremely mellow, with an eerie haunting sound to it."
3,"Solid, not their best","Solid follow up to 2003's Jefferson At Rest, which was the band's best album to date. The first part of the album is strong, and although some of the later songs, especially ""The Way We Live Now"" seem to belong to a different record (like the first Red House Painters records), and are thus totally derivative, this is for the most part the sound of a band that has settled into a groove and is playing to their strengths. A couple of the songs, notably ""Errance"" and ""Precious Blood"" are excellent. You think you can pin down their influences (mostly mid 90's slowcore and moodcore) but they rise above these, increasingly adding nearly prog-metal elements (which would be more obvious on 2006's Offshore) as well as hints of Americana, and playing the songs for all they are worth. This won't appeal to everyone, but if you're a fan of louder slowcore acts like Bedhead and My Bloody Valentine, or even of something like Songs: Ohia, you might like the Early Day Miners."
2,My Son's Favorite toy,"Not sure why, but the first time my son saw one of these... he said in a loving voice ""Bobby"" Not sure where he got that name or why he assigned it to this stuffed animal since he was only 13 months old at the time and had just started talking, but it has been his favorite toy since. He calls for it several times a day and is constantly sucking on the cats nose. We are on our 3rd one in about 7 months as these were obviously not made to be in a child's mouth. The eyes and nose came off of the 2nd one and we are hoping that it was a one time thing. Luckily they are so small there is not a choking hazard."
3,Doesn't work as expected,"The switch is difficult to push, the light is not as bright as I expected and the second flash lite is worthless"
4,Makita 18-Volt LXT Lamp/Flashlight,"I purchased this lamp/light as it was part of the tools using the 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion Cordless tools. After years of having different tools with different voltages and batteries, I wanted to simplify my cordless tools by using the same battery for each. The Fluorescent/Incandescent Lamp portion is OK. I think it could be brighter. The flash light part uses a regular bulb. For the money spent on Makita products, I expected to see LED(s) instead of the bulb. I am looking into an LED replacement for the bulb. The light works fine, but was disappointed in the performance."
3,Makita Flashlight,"Great for hanging in dark spots, however, incandescent light is worthless. It can be left on accidentally causing a dead battery."
3,Do your research,"I bought this unit because it came up as daily special. I was in a hurry at the time and didn't look at it carefully. Found out when it arrived that it wasn't LED. Works good, Hangs well under the vehicle, gives lots of light, and the light isn't to concentrated so as to be overpowering like conventional incandescent trouble lights but without the LED's I anticipate it won't last as long."
4,Quality & versatility,"Although this Flashlight is pricy, particularly if you don't already have a Makita battery & charger, it lives up to it's advertisment. It has versatility in positioning or hanging the unit, provides plenty of light when operating the Fluorescent light and the incandescent light is quit adaquite for on the job or around home use. Great help when general lighting is required for the work area or when there is a power failure. A solid unit that does what is advertised."
4,Great for quick projects,"Not an all day use light, but great for spot work. Hook system a little goofy, but great addition to my rechargable gear. Nothing beats the XLT line."
4,Works GREAT,"I'm not sure what was wrong with the light that other reviewer received because you sure can't get quality like this at the dollar store. Very sturdy construction! The fluorescent light works great. The incandescent light is just OK. I'm not sure why Makita is still using incandescent bulbs in their 18v lights when their 10.8v light has a nice bright LED bulb.. (I own that, too). To those who are concerned about forgetting to push the button twice to turn off the light, just take the incandescent bulb out and forget about the ""flashlight"" portion that you complain about anyway! If anyone's interested in converting the incandescent light in their BML184 or their BML185, you can get an 18v LED bulb on ebay shipped for under twenty bucks. I put one of those in my BML185 and turned it into a powerful LED spotlight, with better battery life! If the incandescent portion of this light was replaced with a nice bright battery saving LED, I'd rate 5 out of 5."
3,"Nice, but not perfect.","As for a Fluorescent Flashlight, the BML184 is GREAT! As for an Incandescent Flashlight, the BML184 is HORRIBLE! The incandescent light is not very bright and awkward to use. Actually, I only purchased the BML184 for the fluorescent flashlight, but the toggling switch is very annoying. Depressing the power button toggles from - OFF - to - Fluorescent - to - Incandescent - to - OFF. So rather than just ignoring the incandescent lamp altogether, I have to step though it to make sure the flashlight is fully turned off. A separate switch for the incandescent lamp or sliding switch would have made this more convenient its usability. Personally, I'd rather they just get rid of the incandescent lamp and save the space and simplify the usabilty."
4,Normal Men,"This tool lightning very well and is very convenient to use! It illuminates for approximately 4 hours.(Excuse my English, I speak French normally)"
4,Good light,"The fluorescent light is fantastic, the flashlight leaves a lot to be desired, maybe an update would put a better lamp or change over to LED technology for the flashlight portion in the future."
3,"Okay, But Battery Issues...","If you only have the smaller sized Makita battery, you will get maybe 1 3/4 hours from the fluorescent light. And if you didn't think to charge your battery immediately before the job, then you're project better be a quick one. And there is no transition from bright to moderate to dim. One minute you will have full light, and the next you will be working in the dark. I replaced the incandescent ""flashlight"" bulb with an LED bulb,as suggested in the reviews, but in doing so I somehow managed to split the rubber ring at the top of the unit. Still not sure how that happened, but keep in mind that the rubber ring is somewhat fragile. Still, the fluorescent light is nice while it lasts, and you will get 3.5 or more hours from the expensive battery (LXT) it was designed for."
1,Terrible Film,"The trailer and all the hype about this film made it seem like it was going to be sick. The first segment was completely over edited, you couldn't even tell what was going on. The music was mediocre. I wouldn't even consider this a ski movie. It's more of an edit as it is only 20 minutes long. I was watching it waiting for it to end, that bad."
2,Really haven't noticed,I haven't noticed a big difference in my appetite at all when I take this. I'm pretty disappointed but I will finish the bottle to see if maybe I'm taking too low of a dose... I did the recommended but I just don't feel anything like more full.
2,Misleading,"When I ordered the bag I assumed I would at least be able to hold my wallet in it, however, even that made the magnetic button hard to clasp. I do have a long clutch type wallet, but if this product was pictured better I would have known that it was too small to actually fit anything."
4,very cute bag,I got this for a friend for Christmas and she really like it. I am thinking of getting one for myself.
1,useless,I bought this so because it was/is like a back pack. I've only had it for a short time and I already have to replace it because a strap broke from the top stitching.
2,Not a good product.,The craftsmanship was not good.It was only ten bucks since it was on sale. I guess I got what I paid.
4,Worked perfectly...,"Bought this for a Lara Croft costume for Halloween - looked great! It had a very strong leather smell, so we had to air it out a few days before wearing it."
3,Serviceable but no cell pouch,"This is a cute little backpack/bag that works well mostly. It doesn't have an outer cell phone pocket or pouch, which makes accessing your cell hard if you keep it inside the bag. The zippers for the outer pockets are hard to use and the pockets quite small, only enough to store chapstick or a small set of keys. Overall, comfortable to wear."
1,disappointed,"I was disappointed with the barbie size bag. I thought it was going to be much bigger. It's child size, I wish Amazon would show each purse with a mannequin or a wallet anything that we could see how big or how small the thing is. Anyway it's way too small for me."
5,Very nice!,"My order came in a timely manner and was just what I wanted. This bag is perfect when you need a casual bag without the bulkiness of a regular purse. Plus it has lots of pockets for such a small, compact design. It's very handy! Thank you!"
3,OK for this price,"You need to keep the wallet and cell phone inside, this two pockets are two small and too easy to open to put anything in so it is not very convenient. I gave it to my teen."
3,too small,this bag looks pretty big in the picture but it is not what i expected. it's pretty small and my own wallet does not even fit in it.
1,Horrible,"The bag in the picture looks much bigger than the actual size, its horrible I was furious to see this!"
1,Incorrect bag received,"I did not get a backpack. I received a very small ""weekender"" bag. It is more like a miniature laptop bag, which could be useful if I had a 10"" notebook. I don't.Unfortunately I had this shipped to someone, who in turn traveled to my location. It is not worth the cost of returning the bag to seller. Very disappointed."
2,much smaller then i expected,This bag is much smaller then i was expecting. the zippers do not open/shut easily. I was very disapointed.
1,Genuine Leather??? I don't think so!,"The sewing was crappy and the strap came right out. I was also able to pierce the so called leather with my nail when I went to pick it up off the table. Now there is a huge whole in the side. I got my money back, less the shipping, but it was the worst buy I have found on here. There is nothing geuine about this so called leather!"
2,So smal!!,"I bought this purse because I though it was really cute and since my hands are always full, I needed a bookbag for a purse. This purse was so small, I could only fit my wallet and my cell phone. The pockets were so small that I couldn't even fit a pack of gum. The quality looked great though, I just wish it would of been bigger."
3,backpack purse,Like the product a little small and dn place to hold money for easy access or credit card holder. Has a small zipper compartment inside. Other then that I think it find. Can't hold much becausse of size.
3,"Dry, riddled with typos, endless lists",I did pass the boards (first time taker) but did not find this book helpful. It was full of errors. It was also very dry and did not suit my style of learning at all. This book is not horrible and I'm sure is useful for many people but it was painful to get through (even more painful than studying for the boards has to be). I used Laughing your way to passing the pediatric boards and absolutely loved it.
2,"pediatrics for dummies, save your time and money","Just back from the Boards. The book is like Pediatrics for dummies and I don't think the test is for dummies! The book is full of mistakes and sometimes sounds also ridicolous (see pulsus paradoxicus). As they say ""If it is in the book you will find it in the Boards"", the contrary it's not true. Save your time and money for better resources."
1,Misleading.,"Since I passed, why would I not want someone else to buy this book? Why would I even care? I bought it on the strength of the 2 authors, but it is truly little more than an outline. Cornell has some great attendings, but it is wrong to sell as advertised, and uncharacteristic of them. Perhaps the publisher is at fault here, trying to sell based on hospital name, and not the authors. It is aggravating to feel duped for having bought it, even if it was only $40. I offended the authors previously and I apologize, since they are in fact, excellent doctors."
1,JUNK!,"Yet another example of Wagan Corp. making false claims about products thatcan't deliver. I bought this product based on Wagan's claim that""It inflates one 16"" car tire in only 90 seconds"". First off in my opinionthis unit was used, not new.There was grime (not grease) all over the base. The box also looked worn. Second, this compressor would have a hard time filling a bike tire in 90 seconds. I tried to fill a partially deflated 16"" tire and ten minutes later the unit was red hot and still wasn't close to being finished. If you want to inflate a beach toy or a basketball this unit would probably do the trick. A car tire? Forget it. Don't take my word, look at reviews of Wagan's other products."
1,buyer avoid,"save yourself some pain and just never buy from this company, damaged box, damaged product, and they do all they can to avoid any responsibility for what they sell."
1,Wagan EL2050 Heavy Duty Air Compressor,"It was my very first time to use this supposedly brand new air compressor (yesterday, Saturday afternoon) since I received it about two months ago. I was extremely disappointed, the compressor looked brand new but, defective. It took me awhile before I even got to start it. It just won't start. I was still able to use it twice but, when I was about to add some more air to my car's tire, it just won't start anymore. It's a piece of junk!!! I am sorry but, this is very true. I don't even know how this air compressor passed the quality control.... Not recommended... :("
4,"Air Compressor with no bells/whistles, gets the job done!","This air compressor does exactly what it says. The product is not dressed up with options, a light or even a ergonomic case; however, this product performs well.Only downside I observed was that the link for the air compressor hose is a screw on, instead of a flip mount.Bottom line, this thing isn't made to look pretty, but it is definitely designed to get the job done and gets it done rather quickly compared to air compressors 2 to 3 times the price."
2,An exercise in virtuosity,"Mark Oconnor is a surperb musician, but this cd has no music to be heard. It is a demonstration of his wizzard like skills and techniques. Fantastic. But I wanted to listen to well played MUSIC- not scales. I wasted my money."
3,My dog is scared of it but...,My Wiener Dog is terrified of this house but it's very pretty and very easy to assemble! :) I hope everyone else has a dog that's not scared like mine! :) It looks pretty in my back yard! But my dog won't go near it! LOL
3,Not so good,Albeit the plot is very good I think something is missing at the end of the book. Maybe JK didn't know how to end the book and wanted to make Cars's brother as if he were a human being. How could it be that a police officer knows that somebody is not guilty -Terry- of a crime and just let him stay in jail? At the book's end just almost in a sleight of hand Cars tie all the loose ends and resolve the case. That's a little far-fetched. Who saved Cars if he was tied up in the neighbor's house with two corpses? Who could find him there?
3,A bit on the slow side,"I really enjoyed ""The Hundredth Man"" and looked forward to this new release. However, I found it did not hold my attention and I had a tough time getting through it. So, about halfway through, I decided to give up on it. I like the characters, but it didn't have the excitement of his other book. Don't read it if you're already sleepy!"
5,Good Purchase,"Shipping was very prompt, and the product was in good condition, as described. I was completely satisfied with purchase"
3,Bizarre & Funny Tale,"Kerley writes an interesting, if a bit far-out, story of those who collect serial killer memorabilia. A murderer from the early '70s, a man called Hexcamp, also produced shocking yet profound paintings. The death collectors, as the aficcionados are called, are very interested in acquiring any pieces by Hexcamp.Our hero, Carson Ryder, is really a funny guy with a dry sense of humor. This could be such a macabre tale (and it is), but somehow it takes on an almost Thin Man quality by injecting humor into the good guys chasing the bad guys. The writing is average to above average, and the story's pacing keeps you reading till the last page.This book fits nicely into the genre, because of its humor and because Kerley doesn't take it all too seriously. Read a somber Mo Hayder tale, and then take a vacation within the genre with this funny tale of art, Paris, and death collectors."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT HIS BEST EFFORT...","After reading Hundredth Man, I was happily looking forward to the next book. Worthwhile reading if you've not read the previous work, but somewhat of a letdown to an eager fan."
1,Not so legendary.,"Grace Z. Chu was once described as a legendary chinese master chef. Her cookbook however, published in 1962 is like a cookbook for novices. Her recipes are primitive and they invariably call for MSG as one of the ingredients.No comparison to books by Barbara Tropp or Nina Simonds."
1,"No, No & NO","This book has nothing to do with eating well or weight loss. If you are an artsy, crafty type you ""might"" like some of the projects she has but none of it has anything to do with eating too much and/or weight loss. She doesn't even know which way a lamp shade fits the light fixture. Sorry, I cannot recomend this book to anyone."
5,Wonderful!,"Well written, entertaining and easy to follow. I definitely reccommend this to anyone looking for a sane solution."
5,Fun Book!,"This is an interesting, fun and factual book. You are encouraged to 'think outside the square'."
2,Lady of Weight Loss,"Not impressed with this book. I love a humorous book, but this one is just silly and dumb."
1,Ambivalent,I am not sure about this book. I have 13 years of Catholic education and am having trouble getting past the feeling that it is sacrilegious. Most of the images look like they are East Indian art and catholic art. I wish I hadn't bought this book.
3,!,"Our Lady Of Weight Loss has Miraculous and Motivational Musings from the Patron Saint of Permanent Fat Removal...written and illustrated by Janice Taylor. This vividly and imaginatively illustrated book depicts the patron saint most Americans wish would help cure obesity or simple over-eating. Taylor describes the saint's warnings and advice in humorous fashion. However, the author, who had for years fought the battle of ping-ponging many pounds off and on again, shares very useful tips and tricks that have helped her achieve her weight goal and maintain it. I have read and followed many diet books through the years, and this one is refreshingly new and has sound ideas with terrific whimsical illustrations that stick in your mind and help keep you on track and away from the refrigerator at midnight. Read the book, stare at the cute pictures, and voila! you'll have a diet angel sitting on your shoulder warning you about what you eat. A good one!"
4,"Great sound, could be a bit more rugged","Loved these a lot, great bang for the buck, literally. The bass response is excellent and they a good job of blocking outside noise. But i'm already on my 2nd pair in less than a year, they could be a bit more rugged. Until i find something better, to date, these are the best value for money in earbuds i've come across."
4,Great ear buds but.....,These head phones are awesome. I have bought them like three times and keep experiencing the same problem with them all. The sound volume seems to be uneven in the head set. One ear bud is loud and the other will so so. I have other headsets so it's not my ears or my hardware that causes this problem. The bass is really good in the headsets also.
2,Poor,The service was very poor. I had to remind the sellers twice before they even rememebered to couruer the earphones. My money for expedited shipping was wasted.
5,It helped me take better photographs,"I bought this book a month back. From the day I bought this book till now, I have seen a marked improvement in the photographs I take. I did not know much about photography and now I am able to look for details in a photograph and am able to judge on how it could have been improved. I cannot claim to have mastered the art of photography but I am certainly thinking now before I go about taking a picture. Another thing that was cool about this book is that it was well laid out and joe had explained the techniques in a very crisp fashion(unlike in otherbooks where you find a lot of text that really puts off even a determined learner)."
4,A LITTLE SHORT,"HERE'S A BOOK THAT MIGHT HELP WITH COMPOSITION. HOWEVER, THE NUTS AND BOLTS (F-STOP, SHUTTER SPEED, LENS, FILM USED) GETSLITTLE ATTENTION.EXPOSURE IS CRITICAL TO PHOTOGRAPHY. GOOD CAMERAS LENSES AND THE RIGHT FILM ALL PLAY IMPORTANT PARTS IN GETTING GREAT PICTURES.""UNDERSTANDING EXPOSURE"" BY BRYAN PETERSON WILL HELP YOU TAKE BETTER PICTURES. COMPOSITION IS LEARNED WITH PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE. HOLD YOUR FINGERS UP IN A RECTANGLE POSITION AND LOOK THROUGH THEM FOR A ""PREVIEW"" OF A SCENE. MAKE BETTER USE OF YOUR VIEW FINDER TOO. GOOD PICTURES ARE A COMBINATION OF GOOD EQUIPMENT, FILM, LENS, EXPOSURE AND COMPOSITION."
2,Not bad - but not great,"Got the book and I can use some of the techniques, but I knd of already knew them. The pictures are great in this book, but they all seem to be from the eraly 80s or from Russia. I wouldn't get this book again unless I checked it out at the library."
3,Not my kind of book,"I'm not sure if this is hardcore trashy BDSM masquerading as literary fiction or literary fiction masquerading as hardcore trashy BDSM.I like the way Niall Griffiths writes but I think I preferred him in Sheepshagger. I found the violence in Kelly and Victor a bit hard to understand.By the way, Sheepshagger, is not pornographic at all. And nor is Stump. In case you were wondering.But Kelly and Victor quite possibly is. I don't know. It's not my kind of porn so I can't tell."
5,Does what I needed it to do.,"It is longer then I expected--legal size. But it keeps my desk papers from being shoved off by the cats, I've got it velcro'd to the desk. Wish it had come in white or off-white but it didn't."
4,Missing a Piece,"ONE OF THE BASKETS IS MISSING A PLASTIC, SNAP ON FOOT. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I INFORM AMAZON OR THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS PROBLEM? Other than that, these baskets are absolutely fantastic items of office equipment. Ease of use is remarkable - documents go into the basket and are taken out of the basket with a minimum amount of physical or thinking effort. Because it is made of wire, it is very easy to see the level of paper documents contained in the basket from the sides and not just from the top. A great purchase."
2,Picture book,"It contains some lovely plates, but it is brief and uninformative about the architecture and plan of these last great country houses of the Gilded Age. No plans or architectural drawings of any kind are included. For the average or casual reader, this makes a nice addition to the coffee table or living room bookshelf; for the savant and architect, it is useless."
4,excellent ladder,"Quality product. The stabilizing feet with intergrated leveling system give added safety and confidence. I cleaned out my gutters..saved almost half the purchase price of the ladders, two story house, and never felt unsafe. Would highly recommend this product. Only 4 stars as the latching mechanism for retracting the ladders takes some getting used to. Other than that quality product."
5,a good solid step,Heavy and as a result nice and solid. Sits very soundly on the ground and feels very safe for an aluminum ladder. Functions smoothly. The self levelling feature is well worth the money. Excellent product
5,Great movie!,"This is a great movie! It shows a very young, cute Bruce Lee in one of his best roles of his career as a child star."
5,loved it,I love reading this series. can`t wait to get the next one. This is a great series and so well written
5,An Eternal Champion,"""There are 6 books in the original Elric saga; Elric of Melnibone is the first. All of them are classics not to be missed. Unlike most modern fantasy works, Moorcock's books have complex plots and are rich in language. Keep a thick dictionary at your side as you read these.""-- Glenn G. Thater, Author of 'Harbinger of Doom'"
2,Elric Saga disappointment,A fan of Michael Moorcock in my 20s I don't know if I've changed with age or this is not up to the standard of his other works. While I knew that this story was about sword and sorcery I didn't know it was 99% sorcery as even Elric's sword is possessed. And the sorcery quickly becomes predictable as Elric always manages to conjur up a convenient spell seconds before impending doom. The biggest disappointment is the lack of emotional depth of Elric himself. There are many sword and sorcery novels far superior to this.
4,You don't have to be a fantasy reader,"I have never, since I was 12 or 13 and read these books and the Lord of the Rings, read fantasy or science fiction. I'm a literary snob and figure that with all the masterpieces of world literature which a lifetime of reading won't provide sufficient time to get through,who needs the drivel, right? But I found this somewhere while going through a miserable separation, and, needing a light read, picked it up. Within 20 pages I was lost in Moorcock's dark, baroque world. Devoured this volume, the second volume and am seeking the final (2). I've also ordered a couple of the ""eternal champion"" collection. So I've gone over to the Geek Side- sue me."
5,Excellent for the aging of skin,This is an excellent cream for older women with aging skin. Blends into the skin at night easily. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist.
1,Not converted to e-form well.,Not well converted. It would have taken little work to make it worth time to read. Good subject matter and could have been done better with little effert.
5,ballbusta duffel bag,Good quality bag with lots of space. Love the shoe or wet compartment on one end and Ball net on the other end. Shoulder strap is comfortable and can be extended to be very long. I recently used it on a weekend trip and used the mesh net for odd ball toiletries that i didn't want leaking on my clothes. And fit enough clothes for my wife and I for the whole weekend. Great product.
4,nice,"It is a nice bag, its a little smaller than i thought, it has lots of bags and space. Using it for the gym"
4,Very nice bag,"4 stars because while I was looking the bag over after taking it out of the packaging a piece broke. One of the clips (the basketball holder end) snapped off as soon as I unclipped it. It still works with the other side snapping into place and keeping it securely closed but technically its broken.The bag however seems well made lol except maybe the clips. I am using this to carry my stuff back and forth to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu/MMA class. The basketball holder part works perfect for boxing gloves. I can fit my Kimono, 2 pairs of shorts, knee/elbow sleeves and an extra kimono bottom with room to spare. I especially like the compartment to hold wet stuff. The side compartment is small and you cannot fit much in it but its still really nice to have an extra zippered compartment."
1,Had high hopes...,I had high hopes for this bag. Disappointed. The ball portion of the bag was awkward. It was not easy to put the ball in or take the ball out. Returned.
4,Disturbing yet intriguing true story about obsessive love,"While the story was good, I didn't care for the manner in which it was written, particulary when you reach the court stage where information is taken directly from complete articles of the time and you find yourself reading the same stuff you already knew over and over again. The author provides good detail but holds you till the end to get ALL the facts. I highly recommend this book just because the story seems so unbelievable."
4,Review,"This is an excellent book. I heard about the story while on a ghost tour in Key West, the tour leader recommended this book and I bought it that night. It's excellently told as a story with different recounts from the Count's own writings, even if they're not so historically correct. I recommend this book for anyone who's even remotely interested. It has a way of capturing your attention."
3,Undying Love: The True Story of a Passion That Defied Death,"What intrigued me the most on getting this book was his life with her. The story is very good but the writing is ok. The author jumps into the important parts like they are nothing. For an example (nothing to do with the book) ""I bought very nice mattress, very well made and comfortable. I slept in it."" In one part he explains his lover for her and literally the next page he dug her up; there's no build up at all. I would say about 80% of the book are his memoirs. You don't know if he's telling the truth or not because he does lie quite a bit. He has a very vivid imagination. It's really not a memorable book. The story is a fantastic and should be made into a movie but the writing just wasn't very well done."
5,A Very Good Book for Girls,"I think ""Elsie's Girlhood"" is a wonderful book. It is wholesome and adventurous. Elsie faces many challenges in this book, and it is inspiring to read this story. I think girls will enjoy this book, as it is very interesting."
3,Rhoda read it!!!,"I haven't read this book, but the fictional character, Rhoda, in The Bad Seed makes a point of reading it. I think it was clever of Maxwell Anderson to include the book Elsie Dinsmore in his play. You must see The Bad Seed to understand why."
3,"unrealistic, but a fun read...","This is the only of the Elsie books in which Elsie disobeys her father and is eventually proven to be wrong in her disobediance. For that reason alone, it's worth at least a skimming. Rose, who is probably my favorite character in the entire series, is especially good here, and even Mr. Dinsmore shows some humanity. Wow. My issues with the book are based mostly on its inherent racism(apparent throughout the series) and anti-Catholic bias. But as ar fun read and a thought provoker, Elsie's Girlhood is one to pull off the shelf every couple of years and re-read."
1,What a disappointment,"This was the first Elsie book I read as a child about 45 years ago. I had an opportunity to go back to it and also read the first two from Amazon. I cannot imagine why I liked it when young - all my other ""youth books"" bore re-reading in adulthood. The sanctimoniousness puts me off most of all. Then the horrifing mentally cruel child-rearing practices exemplified in the first two books could not possibly be a good example to any parent. The other subtle unwarranted elitistic messages also jar - racism, class-ism as well as the clear religious intolerance. I have put Elsie Dinsmore behind me for ever."
5,Using this for years!,"I have taught the Fingermath method to many Learning Disabled and blind students over my 30 year career. I have found that many students just need the tactual aspect of this method to help them jump over to the memorization of basic facts. I especially like using Fingermath to teach the multiplication facts. I have taught many adults, mostly teachers, and it is funny, but they have a harder time catching on, so don't give up! This is a gift!"
5,outstanding,This a must own cd the music is great the cd has just the right music mix need to add it to your music libary
5,wax,purchased a one pound package of grafting wax is a very good product..throwbridge grafting wax is the best of all.
1,Product not as described,"I was specifically looking for a longer baster and the 14.5"" quoted in the specifications is what drove my decision to purchase this product. The baster I received was only 10.5"" long (bulb to tip) which is among the smaller of the basters available."
4,Fall in love with 'For My Love',"With the superbly chosen classical tracks that are able to haunt your very soul, this beautiful collection of instrumental masterpieces have been on my radar for some time. I lost my copy years ago and the simple fact that I am willing to go to all this trouble for it says a lot. Imagine, I fell in love with this album as a teen in High school. One of the first classical cd's I received from my dad. This introduced to me to a world outside of pop,rock, and other mainstream genres catering to our current generation. Its one of those albums that will never get old and will stay on your shelf only to be picked up when the ideal time is served-- and trust me there will be many times found befitting. Whether you're in a mellow or romantic mood or just trying to unwind (the reason why I listened) this is the perfect CD to be had."
1,Not worth the money,"A friend of mine suggested I try some homeopathic medicine for my depression. Well, this came up on Amazon. I am not really sure if it helped my depression, but it sure didn't sweeten my coffee! I thought for sure this would be a great sweetener being 80% sucrose, but I had to use just about every pellet in one cup of coffee and even that didn't sweeten it. I love the idea of curing my ills through my diet, but it's just got to have a little more flavor for this price."
2,It Ain't Jellyfish,"I read somewhere these guys were going for The Jellyfish sound.Based on this release they fell way short.Just another, I've heard it all a million times before (and better) pop album."
2,Mis-leading image,The image shows 4 hooks. But the package is only for 2. You'll have to read the product description carefully to realize you only get 2 for your money instead of four shown on the image.
4,Ahead of its time,"Bernstein was ahead of his time - he anticipated and preceded the HIP revolution by several years.Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, this is not the full NY Philharmonic. It IS a reduced ensemble. The extraordinary concertmaster at that time, John Corigliano, later told the story of how he had to completely change his technique in order to play this music the way Bernstein indicated it should be. Corigliano was trained in the romantic style of bowing and using ""short"" bow technique, and coming off the string constantly, was simply not done at that time.This is not a sterile performance - it is full of life. To this day, there is not a more vibrant recording of if the ""diverse"" instrument concerto. Its a knockout. This recording was a revolution at the time, and it still holds up today. Not ""pure"" - and that is in no way a negative - but a fully viable, engaged performance. Highly recommended."
2,He's not really a Baroque conductor,"I hate having to give this CD a fairly low rating. However, the fact is, Bernstein is a master at 19th Century music (and 20th as well), but falls down in Mozart and in Baroque. This CD is no exception.His conducting of The Four Seasons, is what you may expect from Bernstein. He conducts with vigor, bombast, intensity, and other elements (such as a large dynamic range) that one doesn't typically associate with Baroque music. He doesn't have a stately grace or even a slightly cold touch - both of which I feel are vital to correctly perform Baroque.So, if Bernstein's approach is your cup of tea, then you should, by all means, buy this album. You will love it. However, if you are more of a purist or traditionalist, then you should turn your attentions elsewhere."
5,Lovely folkloric dancing & costuming with Serena,"Nice DVD with several folkloric performances featuring Serena Ramzy, along with Bedouin dancers, musicians and Hossam Ramzy on percussion. Serena also included a section of succinct how-to's for 11 steps, including slow-motion demonstrations with voiceovers detailing the techniques. The how-to section also includes the same steps shown in real time. The DVD is well indexed so that you can easily select individual performances, or go to a specific step in the how-to section and see it in slow-mo or real time. It is helpful that the booklet which comes with the DVD also spells out the steps and gives further info about the background of the dances. If you like the music on this DVD it is available seperately on CDBedouin Tribal Dance"
5,Whatcha gonna do?,"I remember watching this show on Nickelodeon when I was a young. I really wanted my kids to be able to see it so I searched high and low and finally found Movies Unlimited. I was not dissapointed with this dvd. My copy came burned on a dvdr, so make sure your player can handle it. With that aside, it's a very well put together dvd. If you're one of the few who have any memory of this show, you won't regret the purchase."
2,Product is Not As Advertised,"Product delivered is not as advertised. The binoculars received had the bearing compass, but not the ""built-in range finding horizontal and vertical mil reticle"" which is mentioned in four (4) locations in the product specifications. Attempting to have these exchanged by the seller for a pair that provides these features has not proven successful. Very disappointed."
3,For one person!,"It is OK for one person on the boa,t if setup right.Pain in the neck to get it right, no zoom adjustment when needed!Lots of money no practical enough."
4,No Good In Art by Miriam Cohen,My kindergarteners love this story about Jim and his supportive First Grade friends. The simple language is appealing (and not babyish!) The book also underscores the role ( positive and negative)a teacher plays in developing the child's self-esteem. It's a favorite!
1,?Ty beanie baby-bushy the lion,"Horrible---not a regular sized beanie baby(and I know the difference between McD's teenies, regular, and buddies), embroidered eyes instead of plastic, crumpled tag that was a single-sided tag instead of folded tag, nothing new about it at all. Totally disappointed, received a nasty e-mail from the company(seller) and it is in the mail to go back."
2,Not very impressed.,"This is not anything you would want to write home about. Examples do not seem to fully get the concepts across to the reader and it lacks in defining some critical terminology. I would add that the student solutions manual that provides the full worked out problems to all odd numbers, chapter reviews, etc. is a must have if your instructor is not all that great, which is something you really need if your school uses this text!"
1,Poor,"I taught this class with this book several times, and it makes the material more difficult. It is one of the poorest textbooks available for this class."
4,It's A Book,"It isn't the nicest book I've gotten. Heavily used, but it's a book and it has the cd's and codes still, so I am satisfied."
4,Good book.,"This book is fine. It's everything you would really expect out of a calculus book. Nothing too special, but it's not a bad book either."
3,Kind of weak....,I bought this thinking I was going to get more of the electrifying performance at woodstock...well....its not. It was recorded before powerhouse drummer Michael Shrive joined the group...and it sounds it. Its nice and pleasant but overall pretty weak.
2,Too limited a view,"I do agree with William Easum's basic assumptions, that ""todays"" church is in trouble and can not survive with it's current set of paradigms and practices. What troubles me is the fact the Mr. Easum does not address more current change management processes, the role of seminaries in preparation of clergy, the lack of leadership development practices, nor the antiquated governance systems employed in must church institutes. I would also encourage readers to develop a full understanding of the history of this country, as Mr. Easum also urges, and the period of time from now to the mid-2000's before engaging in a large scale change process. One might read a book entitled the ""Fourth Turning"".Though I agree with most of the content, I would have liked to have seen a more systemic approach to the illes that not only effect the church, but all institutions as we know them."
3,A Sweet but Weak Debut.,"I remember the first hit single and title cut (which I didn't really care for remade by Mariah Carey either) and the second single, ""Low Down So & So,"" which was better, but not enough to score a major R&B hit (even with all of its funky breakbeats and spoken interlude.) The rest is merely filler. Davis has a weak, thin voice as well as a nasal diction much along the lines of Brenda K. Starr or Paula Abdul. She COULD HAVE had fared better had she chosen/written stronger material/sought outside production assistance. For ME, it was borderline ""flava-less"" for a time when flava was abound."
2,one hit wonder,Look I bought this for the song Sweethart. It is the only thing worth listening to on here. So if you get it cheap make the purchase.
5,"Fresh, original, beautifully illustrated designs","For anyone who has seen the movie, ""The Truman Show,"" and wanted to move into his town, these are the houses you're looking for. The floor plans are delightful, and most are suited for the narrow lot restrictions in a waterfront community. Designed for privacy, and to make the most of a view lot, I would highly reccomend these plans for anyone building a dream vacation home."
4,Great music from a great tour,"Caught this concert 11+ years ago & both Al & Peter White gave a fabulous performance. The CD has the same feel as the concert - very mellow - lots of acoustic guitar. Yes, it's quiet & not for everyone but it remains one of my all time favorites!"
5,The heart of Dublin exposed in all it's glory and pain.,"Set around the great lockout when Dublin Employers set out to break the unions in 1913 strumpet city is the story of the people at the bottom of the ladder, the whores, the blue collar workers, the small people who dreamed of something more but who worked for the next few shillings to get them to the end of the week. This is Dublin when it had the largest red light district in the world, and when it was the arsehole of the Glorious British Empire over which the sun was just about to set. For anyone who has read Joyce and seen the beauty of Dublin depicted by Ulysses, they should lift the mat and see what lay underneath. This is the real novel of Dublin, meaty, raw and captivating. A loveable ould whore god bless her, a strumpet, Strumpet city!"
5,brilliant book,saw the series on Irish t.v years ago but only recently read the book. As usual.......... the book is so much better. A terrific read. You will love most of the characters & love to hate others.
5,"Get the movie, too.","I loved this book when I read it in the 1970s, and I recommend the RTE miniseries, which is available from Netflix."
4,No brainer,"This is kind of a no brainer. Of course they fit my Bostitch brad nailer perfectly and work exactly as they should. The big surprise was that this time the package arrived intact. In the past the package has been toasted around in the shipping box and come open allowing the brads to fall out and skater all over the place, and sometimes right out of the shipping box. I don't know why Amazon can't figure out that putting a little piece of tape on the brand box would make all the difference."
2,"OK, but........","I obviously got a box of brads that somebody else had returned, the box was taped back up somewhat amateurishly. I think the brads are all there but not sure.If I have to, I'll pay more to purchase from somewhere else next time so I can make sure I get what I pay for."
5,Jubilant,"I got this for Christmas and I love it. What a wonderful voice this man has. My favorite is ""Mary, Did You Know?"""
3,Not really interesting,Doesn't really tell me anything that I don't already know.It's an Ok book for me; just to thumb thru.
5,Yolen book,The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled. It suits the purpose for which it was ordered. Definitely would order again.
1,the bean track is full of beans,i just bought the bean track and i'm bringing it back. it was really hard to set up and it is really unstable even if you just tap it the track falls off of the yellow arms because they do not connect to the track. the beanz are good but the track stinks.
1,Biggest piece of cr*p ever manufactured,"After trying for half an hour to figure out how to make the beans go down the track without getting stuck at the turns, I finally decided that it was physically impossible. The track is not tall enough, the beans won't go down. Don't waste your time or money on this...this is going right back to the store as soon as I find the receipt."
1,Not worth the $$$ - it doesn't work.,"First, the track pieces go together easily (that's the only good thing I can say). There's two problems - the track doesn't attach to the yellow 'arms' that extend from the posts, so it's diffcult to stabilize the track and the posts aren't tall enough to really get some momentum going to get the beanz to the bottom (the beanz tend to stall at every corner). We might try building something with Lego to see if we can prop it up and get it to work. This toy is more work than it's worth."
4,Fun for mighty bean collectors,My first racetrack was this one and I had trouble setting it up but I did and it's really fun! The only thing is it has to be angled just right for it to work. A MUST for big mighty beanz collectors.
2,TERRIBLE!,"I expected a blaring, exciting performance on Beethoven's epic Ninth Symphony in this album, with Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic for CBS/Sony; it turned out to be the opposite.All the other Beethoven symphonies he recorded for CBS/Sony are great, especially the Third, the Fifth (despite an intolerably sluggish first movement), and the Sixth. But the Ninth is a complete dissapointment.Despite Bernstein's overt and fast conducting, the performance completely lacked the power Karajan had, and even the cleaniness and precision fellow conductors Szell and Ormandy had. The brass in particular wasn't as blaring as they did on the Third.The tenor was simply awful. His timbre was one of the worst I've ever heard. As for the Julliard School chorus (and Julliard is supposed to be America's No. 1 music academy), no offense but the singers sounded immature, a far cry from the rich, clean, powerful voices professional choirs utlizes.One word, TERRIBLE!"
2,Too simple for the older kids/Too terrifying for the younger ones.,"The suggested reading level is 4-8 for this, but older kids will be bored by its simplicity, boring illustrations, and lack of words.But if you mistakenly buy it for a younger group, they'll never take a bath again after seeing the huge, terrifying, aggressive dinosaurs that come out of the bathtub.Unlike his book ""Fire Truck"" (a book which has equally dull illustrations but at least does have some merit through a counting exercise), it's less clear that the dinosaurs are a figment of the boy's imagination in this book than when the boy in the other book mutates into a fire truck. And while I like picture books that tell a story with their illustrations, there's really no story here except a boy in a tub crowded out by prehistoric beasts.There are some great dinosaur books out there for kids who love them -- and this just isn't one of them."
5,It's weird to fuss over this one!,This really works as well or better than other brands but for a long time it has been unavailable from local retailers. Thanks for offering it . . . the rings and stains do go away when using Lime-A-way.
1,Read the small print,"I needed Lime Away to clean my stainless steel sink, so I picked up this bottle, missing the small print that said it was toilet bowl cleaner. It totally destroyed my faucet, corroding it and discoloring it horribly. They should really make the words ""Toilet Bowl Cleaner"" bigger on the bottle."
4,Like it,"Liked it very much, I love to grab and go with flies in the case w room for my nippers. My only minor complaint is that the zipper on the rod compartment could open farther, it is a bit of a tight fit to put in the rod butt at an angle. It is well constructed and good looking. I recommend it."
5,A Great Church Outreach! Wonderful Parenting Tool!,"A Great Church Outreach!We have implemented Mac's 'Parenting with Dignity' curriculum into our education program at our church.

4,handy device,"unique gift for my mother who alsways has a lot of books and papers in the passanger seat of her car. This allows her to have her stuff handly in the passanger's seat, but when she has passangers it doesn't take her a week to move it to her trunk. All she has to do is pick up the tray and move it. A great gift for any clutter bug with a vehicle."
2,Three Perfect Days in Less than 30 Minutes,"If you count credits & general conversation,this tape is way TOO short. Its running is considerably under 30 minutes. Lauren does the intro but little else. They stay at one high end hotel for all 3 days although some of the photography is pleasing & current.. wait for the next cable car"
5,Touches the soul.,"I feel as though some of the pieces of music on this CD touch my soul when I listen to them, and I often listen to this CD while I'm working on my computer. The melodies are haunting yet relaxing and soothing."
1,Horrible!,"Since I've installed this software, it has slowed down my internet searching in the worst way. It is hanging up and constantly flashing the hourglass and not letting me scroll down efficiently, even though the page is done loading. What a let down from Symantec. I have been a loyal happy customer of the Internet Security product until this year, and if they don't improve their product and either provide a fix for these issues or issue another release, they are not only going to lose me as a customer but many others that I teach to. I have recommended this software to my many students and will have to warn them not to buy this year's version. Time to try the competitor! Don't waste your time and money hoping it will work out okay for you--that's what I did even after reading bad reviews on it. I learned my lesson. Get it back together, Symantec!"
5,Made to last,"I purchased this pinky ring during Black Friday on a whim, and three years later, I still love it.The form is flattering to an overly thin finger, and I'm able to bend it to adjust the width if need be. The pink stones are shiny without being tacky, and the ring has gone through much wear and tear without any major damage. When you're as klutzy as I am, that's saying a lot!This is a great product, and I'd definitely consider more from the same jeweler."
1,Dreadful!!!!,"This is an absolutely awful directorial debut from Nicolas Cage! There are so many things to dislike about this turkey, not the least of which are a bad script, overacting on the parts of Blethyn and Franco, terrible music, predicatable plot and a host of other problems. Blethyn's southern accent is so overdone that it is actually humorous. And a scene with Franco in which he discovers that a woman he just had sex with is addicted to cough syrup is outright silly. This is a terrible, dreadful, awful, insipid waste of time. See ""Showgirls"" instead; it's bad as well, but at least it provides some good laughs!"
3,James and Mena Shine,"James Franco delivers another intense, emotional performance in Nicholas Cage's directorial debut Sonny, about a young man who is forced to choose between hustling and living a normal life. The story is intriguing, but never fully developed, and the directing is choppy which makes for difficult viewing. The acting is ok from most of the actors. Besides from James Franco, Mena Suvari finally gives a performance that is worth mentioning. Brenda Bleythyn is over the top, annoying, and loud, and the accent-obnoxious. She usually gives amazing performances, but this time, she missed, and Nic Cage comes in at the end with a rediculous cameo. The films pace is a little slow, but it did keep my interest. See this film for James Franco and Mena Suvari, other than that..I would advise staying away."
3,mostly sunny,"The acting for the most part is superb in this movie. I've never seen James Franco do better. Mena Suvari handled her part quite well, and Harry Dean Stanton comes across as the veteran pro that he is. The direction, however, is a bit shaky. The story mostly plays as a big screen production, but at times devolves into moments of forced drama, melodramatic like one would see on the big stage. Most of these scenes involved the mother character and left me with an odd feeling of disbelief. The story, then, gives mixed results, falling short of convincing us of the plights of its characters."
4,Something Different,James Franco plays a very attractive former military man who returns home to his less than stellar family. I loved this movie. It was original and something different. James Franco deserves some indy awards buzz for his portrayal of Sonny. Nicholas Cage did a great job with his directorial debut. There is not much I didn't like about this film. It was something different and I appreciated that. Nick Cage also shines in his brief cameo in the film.
4,Lots of potential =),"First hearing a few of Dryft's songs on Pandora, I had to own these songs: fmw, fmw(ksp remix), and ""untitled"". These are MUST OWN songs. The rest of the album is sub-par and doesn't really live up to what Dryft could be if they tried harder. I get the feeling that artists are afraid of releasing too much good music on one album for the fear of living up to that high standard the next time they release another album. It seems like for that reason they only release a few good songs on an album, and the rest mediocre music, giving them the opportunity to out do themselves the next time around.Politics aside though, if you're interested in seeing what there other music is like, I would download the entire album. If you're strapped for cash, just download those 3 songs for a third of the price."
3,Thin and pale,"The Uptown Dots Boppy cover is actually much lighter in color than pictured here; it's not unattractive, but the colors are much more on the pale pastel side. More to the point, the fabric is a cotton muslin that's thin and a little coarse (you wouldn't want sheets made from this material) and since the washing instructions say to dry it only on the ""low, delicate cycle,"" it seems pretty clear that it's ready to shrink upon washing."
5,LOVE MY GRANDBABY'S BOBBY; SO GOT ONE FOR MY HOUSE.,"I LOVE MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S BOBBY PILLOW THAT HER MOM USES AT HER HOUSE, SO I DECIDED TO GET ONE TO KEEP AT MAWMAW'S HOUSE TOO!"
3,A spiritual letdown,"Although I have great admiration for Robert Hellenga's writing which is beautiful, after finishing Philosophy Made Simple, I was left with an emptiness and sadness for his character, Rudy. Rudy was so close to finding the fullness of life through the understanding and acceptance of his circumstances and the way he respected others with whom he lived and experienced life. He was the greatest of the philosophers, not those of history who cast aside the miracle of life. As his daughter Margot did when she bought an impulsive ticket to Italy, Rudy's character would have been much better served if he had closed the door to the past, left Texas behind and filled his life with beauty and love and bought an implusive ticket to India."
2,Doesn't fit,"This thermostat is listed here and on Motorad's website as fitting a 1993 Geo Storm GSI with a 1.8 liter engine, but the flange is too small and will not fit into the thermostat housing. I gave it two stars because it opened up when tested in a pot of boiling water."
2,Public Defender Volume 1-3,Unfortunately the picture quality was not too good because it has not been digitally remastered. The sound was good.
2,The Case is Useless,"I only bought this set in order to have covered silverware to keep in my desk at work. The case does not stay closed or fit properly. Even when I remove the silverware entirely, I cannot get it to close, let alone stay closed.Other than that, the silverware itself is sturdy and fits together well. If you do not need a case to cover the part that goes in your mouth, I would recommend this set. If you plan on traveling with it or keeping in a drawer and want the case for sanity reasons, don't bother."
4,Just what I was looking for!,"I had a set of Bambu To-Go Ware utensils, but after two years the utensils cracked and were not usable. I decided to go the metal route and researched the reusable utensil options. I came across this sleek design, and I was so glad that I purchased this set. The utensils are good sizes for an adult and the handles are not uncomfortable to use. I knocked off a star since you need to be careful of the serrated edge of the knife. (A few times the fork and spoon were difficult to take out and my fingers grazed the knife. Ouch!) Generally a wonderful purchase!"
1,Mainstream Medical Birth Beliefs,"I was a bit dissapointed in this two part video series. It is quite outdated now, even from the medical aspect of it, specifically relating to hospital procedures. The one thing I did appreciate about this movie was the opportunity to see the actual birth, however I definately do not feel I got my money's worth."
4,Redemption,"Greg Keelor has always been the rocker in Blue Rodeo, and the experimentalist. Whatever sounds made certain Blue Rodeo albums trademark sounds, they belonged to Keelor. This is the case here and you can see where his songwriting was going for the next Blue Rodeo albums. This is a pretty quiet record, and it fits it just fine. While Jim Cuddy is an essential part of Blue Rodeo, he isn't missed here, nor would he fit. Imagine Beck and Kula Shaker getting together to make a record and break out the slo jamz! High points are ""No Landing (Lucknow)"", ""White Marble Ganesh"" and ""Star of the Show""."
3,very cute...but really mini,"I bought this pull toy as a gift for a friend. It is so cute, but much smaller than I anticipated (I should have carefully read the dimensions). Before I left the party yesterday, the paint was already scraping off, and the string is not long enough for a toddler to pull easily. My friend will be attaching an additional string. However, it is all wood and very adorable."
2,its pretty. nothing else,"again: its is pretty!!! mmmmmmmm.....what else?:) not much! its small, like small small small. id say about 11oz cup size or so. we took it to the playground once and the paint came off the wheels and sides of this pretty cow. just to keep it at home like a toy its ok, but take it outside is a NO-NO and definitely not a walk-alone toy."
2,Sadly dissapointed,I really want to love this toy. It's adorable and I got it for my son to try to prevent yet another plastic toy entering our house however he has barely paid attention to it in the two months since his 1st birthday that the toy has been in our house. If it was bigger it might get noticed more but it is really tiny and the string is short so I think he is not sure what to do with it. He loves the wooden push along kangaroo he got which was only a few dollars more so I recommend that instead.
4,"Fun, great strobe light, just smaller than expected","It is a GREAT buy for the price. Easy install, powered by a two-wire setup (red & black). Works well, looks very cool in my car. Make sure you check the dimensions though. From the picture, I expected the light to be bigger."
3,An overview only,"Following the style of her previous ""Managing Natural Resources with GIS"", this book provides some vignettes on the use of GIS in health related fields. There is not a great deal of detail, although she provides some references for additional research. The book is well illustrated with full color images and the price is right.(...)If you are looking for some details on how GIS is being applied, this may be a good book to read, but you can find many similar items on the ESRI web site (or the sites of any of the popular GIS software producers)."
4,a top-tier al stewart album,"Not Al at his absolute best, but very close. ""Angel of Mercy"" and ""Trespasser"" are the standout songs here for me. My CD has the tracks listed in the wrong order, which can be a bit maddening. All in all, one of Al's better efforts and probably the best of his later material, along with ""Between the Wars""."
3,"Not Bad, not great","To me Al's best albums were the ones that sold best ie Time passages and Year of the cat. The productions then were superb, with well balaced guitar leads (by Peter White?) and bits of picturesque instruments like the accordion in some of them or spanish guitar in On the border and above all lyrics that flowed effortlessly and were highly evocative of other times. This effort sounds a little contrived to me - non more than Trains. The best one for me is Peter on the White sea. If you haven't heard Al's work before I'd suggest you start elsewhere, but if you have, this album is still interesting and good enaugh to add to your collection of Al Stewart albums."
2,A Different Ear,"Just last evening I had the opportunity to enjoy Al Stewart in a wonderful acoustic outing at The Coach House in Southern California. Today I was scanning Amazon to see if I could find his latest album ""Down In The Cellar"" when I came across the reviews for ""Famous Last Words."" I really don't understand what I've read with the mostly outstanding reviews listed here? I'm a great fan of many years but ""Famous Last Words"" just does nothing for me. I've tried to like it but can't find anything that moves me. This was especially disappointing as a follow-up to ""Last Days of the Century"" one of his top 3 recordings (in my thoughts,anyway). Al has been one of the few artists that I will collect based on faith alone but with ""Famous Last Words"" he struck out this time at bat."
5,HP Laserjet 1100: Five years later gets five stars!,"The most dependable printer I have ever used/owned! I have one in my home office and two are used at my company. Since this printer has proven itself in mass sales, you should not worry about toner supply for the next 15 years.Pros:1) Metal case and sturdy plastic design keep this printer in one piece while moving around the office.2) Flawless support with Windows XP.3) Good black and white printing quality on photo paper.Cons:1) Rollers in printer sometimes need to be recalibrated, IE: printer will pull more than one sheet when printing."
1,Cheek,"I never write reviews, but Ms Briles' sheer cheek has made me want to.The book itself is, well, mildly OK, simply not well enough written to really capture anyone's attention. The explanations about different financial products seem to have been written in a bit of a hurry and not revised. Unless you have a basic financial education, you won't understand much, and if you do, then you won't learn anything new. You'd be much better off reading something by David Bach.The sheer cheek of the author is the way she logs on to Amazon to review her own book with five stars - twice. I suppose she was worried by the fact that nobody else had posted a review. Well, now I have."
2,Not enough songs... Even less on the titular topic,"Why are there only 16 songs on this CD when the original Broadway's Greatest Love Songs had 20? They're cheating customers out of 4 songs! Also, for a sampler mix of Broadway ""love"" songs, this CD has very few songs that actually fit that category, at least in the traditional sense. For example, ""Our Last Summer"" from Mamma Mia is sung by two former lovers--now friends--reminiscing on old times. Other songs that don't quite fit: ""Good Morning Starshine"" from Hair, ""Try To Remember"" from The Fantasticks, ""I Dreamed A Dream"" from Les Miserables..? All of these are beautiful songs, but when there are so many traditional, lovers-declaring-their-love-type songs out there, why would you include the aforementioned numbers? Personally, I would have chosen songs such as ""Elaborate Lives"" from Aida, ""Gimme Gimme"" from Thoroughly Modern Millie, or ""Still"" from Titanic in replacement."
3,It is in need of 1 more musical.,I think they need to consider putting one more musical on this CD. This musical would have to be Wicked. What about As Long As Your Mine (from Wicked of course)? I think I would like this CD better if they could put Wicked on it. But of course this may not be true for everyone because obviously my favorite musical of all time is Wicked.
2,Not for Me,"This book shows only photos of architecturally beautiful custom homes. So it might work for you if your home is already pretty ""great"" or if you are planning to rip out walls and do some major structural remodeling. It is NOT about interior decorating for the middle class tract-home owner on a budget. One of my personal gripes: What is with all the bath tubs, showers and master bedrooms facing huge, uncovered windows? Trying to scare the neighbors?"
3,Great Book !,"I have to say that this book is good, but not as exciting as the past editions. I remember some of the records from back in the 80's and I see most of them have been broken. I am glad to see that my hometown, Chicago, has set some records. That I haven't seen in the past editions. I love this book. Only problem........ need more pictures!! I would even liked it better if it was a hardback book."
3,rodeo not considered a sport i guess,"i was very disappointed being a fan of rodeo, that there was no mention of the sport in the ""sports"" section of the millenium book. on the television show ""guiness world records"", the popular bull named Bodacious, who was recently retired, was proclaimed as ""the world's most dangerous bull"". why wasn't that mentioned at least in the ""animal"" section of your book?"
1,No Substance.....,Where was the plot! There was absolutly no character development and it felt like I was reading a dictonary! Very little social commentary.....if there was a 1/2 star I would have given it that! Please spare your eyes and time and choose another book...
1,"Cheaply made, terrible support.",I dropped this item on a carpeted floor from about 3 feet. Cracked the display. Called the company. No love. Ridiculous.
2,Instructions are complicated,"I have yet to clip this to my belt and start using it. Still trying to set it up with printed instructions that fall far short of clear! The various buttons are hard to read. The instruction manual is written for four different models. Some technical person wrote them, forgetting about the poor clueless consumer. Very frustrating. If I can get the hang of all these settings (just tell me how to reset the thing every day, PLEASE!), then perhaps I'll change my mind. Right now, I simply want to throw this thing in a drawer and forget it."
1,"I tried, but I give up","This thing wasn't designed well. Maybe they tried to do too much with it. The programming is very complex and impossible without the instructions (and the instructions are not written well either). Now after my final use before I return it, the battery and holder slide out as I run and resets the program, and erases everything I was trying to track.The disappointment with this unit will definitely affect my decision to buy anything from Oregon Scientific.Conclusion: DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!! Even if you get it for free, the time and aggravation are not worth it and will not do the job intended. If I could give it less than one star I would!!Here is a link that also shows the manual.[...]"
3,Difficult to Program-Pedometer,This pedometer works fine but I find it difficult to program. I don't wear a belt so cliping it to my waist band or shoe does not work very well since it tends to fall off. It does seem to work fine in my pocket.Also we asked if this pedometer was made in Chine and were told no. WRONG! That was disappointing.
3,Needs more work,"Matthew Shipp is one of my favorite pianists. Last year's New Orbit was at the top of my list of best CDs of the year, so I had high hopes for this release. The album continues an electronic experiment that he started with David S. Ware on Corridors and Parallels, but unfortunately doesn't come off as well. Marrying Shipps dense percussive style with electronica seems like a no brainer, and on the opening track it is. Unfortunately, the majority of FLAM's programming seems to be an after thought that just gets in the way of Guillermo Brown's masterful funk drumming. One wonders what the likes of a Tom Jenkinson or Mike Paradinas could do with Shipp's compositions. Hopefully, Shipp will go back to the lab and continue experimenting, because despite this rather mixed affair you can see a foreshadowing of great things to come."
4,Original songs worth hearing... again.,"Okay, so I'm one of the band members... read on.Do you ever put songs on repeat? If so, you'll love this project; there are definitely some 'repeat' tunes. And if you have never put any song on repeat, after listening to this album you stand a great chance of joining the ranks of those of us who are not ashamed to repeat a song or two...What I love about this project is the ease with which any believer can emotionally identify. For example, the title cut of this album talks about being able to hear God. Haven't we all struggled with this one? And not only to hear God, but once we're able to hear, to KNOW Him. How awesome! (Great lyrics, Cliffy. I know they're from your heart.)Buy the CD. Listen to the CD. Repeat the CD....And may God touch you as you get to know Him more."
4,What a great CD!,"Hallel's album is really awesome! I listen to it everyday and it really helps me focus on God and my daily walk. God is really working through your music to get his message out loud and clear. God is so awesome and worthy of all praise and you guys, (Hallel), are going full force to bring that praise to the lost."
4,Sincere and Honest Worship,This new CD is wonderful. The recording quality of the new CD is much tighter and flowing than the freshmen project. If you are looking for a CD that is relevant and powerful this is it. The musical quality is excellent and the heartbeat of the music is authentic.
4,A TRUE REVIEW,"I liked this book, but I was disappointed with the ending. I won't say what happened (read it!), but it certainly wasn't what I expected. I also thought that since the plot of the book was about Todd, that it should be written in his point of view, not Paulie's. As an overall book, I would definitely recommend it. I really liked the baseball part of it and I liked the way the author could make you feel the character's emotion. I thought this was a pretty good book."
2,A excitement baseball thriller,"It was exciting, but it had bad language. If it didn't have that language I would give it a five. Todd the main charter has with doing drugs, and his friend Pauile who trys to get him drugs."
3,Not What I Had Hoped For!,"The 1999 reprint is a ""Facsimile reprint""; the pictures appear to be photocopies of the original photographs - the quality is not up to Dave Friedman's norm. Some of the photos can be found in other publications; so, do not purchase this book for the photographs.John Christy's narrative is informative and included a lot of stories/facts that I had not heard previously. It's style is very readable. If it were not for the pictures in the 1999 reprint, I would rate this book at 4 or 5 stars..."
2,Nice but they stop making drivers,I had the first generation of this and they quit making drivers for it. Just keep it in mind as you buy it and expect to keep it for awhile. I contacted Tascam and they told me to just buy a new one.Nice
1,Toxic Waste,"This coat arrived smelling literally like a chemical waste dump. I tried hanging it outside in the wind and spraying it repeatedly with Fabreeze. The seller has refused to reply to emails so it appears they know they are selling a dangerous and horribly smelling product. I would suggest you avoid this seller just as you would a chemical waste dump. They both rate the same on my scale. I wouldn't have given this product and seller a ""1"" but it was the only way to let the public know how awful this product is."
1,Angry and Frustrated,"I have a Gallery Leather Album, which is great quality. I cannot, however, find refill pages ANYWHERE. Any suggestions????"
2,"Love's Rambling, Not-so-accurate Departure from the original ""Journey""","Nothing like the book. At all. A couple of names are the same, and Missy and Willie are further out west, but other than that, you would never know that this was based on Janette Oke's novel.Several reviews have noted Missy's change of actress. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the change. I had no real problem with January Jones' portrayal, and I believe that Erin Cottrell was a little older than her intended age in this film. However, Erin's mannerisms and less willowy build are closer to how I have always pictured the strong-willed Missy.This is a relatively family-friendly movie with references to faith in God, so that's the two stars.I could go on to list the many huge departures from the book, but other reviews have already covered the big ones. Instead I will just encourage you to go read the book series - it is a lovely!"
5,Loves Long Journey,Loves Long Journey is a wonderful family movie. We need more entertainment of this quality.
2,Where is January Jones?,I miss January Jones. If you read the book you will see why for she brought the Missie I read in the book. What also dissapointed me is the inaccuracy of the movie and the notion that Missie can't COOK. I believe any daughter of Marty could cook very well and since she could make corn bread pudding and fried chicken (In the first two she mentions she can make them) I believe she wouldn't burn biscuts. Erin I believe is a okay actress but I really REALLY perfer January Jones. I hope if they make Love's Abiding Joy that they would use JANUARY JONES.This movie is okay for renting or buying for it is a okay movie but wouldn't make a good sequal to the Love Comes Softly series.
1,not as good as the other two,"The first two movies in this series were far better than this one. The acting is horrible (especially by Erin Cotrell). I hope she took the money she made from this film and bought some acting classes with it. Overall, I was really disappointed with this film, considering that the first two were excellent."
2,"okay movie, but nothing like the book","Please don't judge the book by the movie. The book is wonderful, but the movie is not. Almost nothing that happens in the movie happens in the book. The books are so good and would make such wonderful movies, why they had to destroy a wonderful story, and why Janette let them, I'll never know."
5,Excellent movie,Loved this movie of Jeanette Okeshad all the characters in itgood family movieIn fact I have two copies of the DVDchfancier
5,Love's Long Journey....,"I really like this movie!The plot and acting was super!Some parts were also so sad,like when Clark was writing to Missy!I like all of the movies in this series they have made, and Michael Landon Jr. was a really good director. I highly recommend them,not to rent but to own!"
2,Love's Long Dull Movie,"Weak plot development, stilted dialogue, mediocre acting, and overbearing moralizing characterize this dog of a movie. This one is better left unwatched.Eric Alan Isaacson"
5,Love's Long Journey,"I have enjoyed all the ""Love's...."" series i.e. ""Love Comes Softly"", ""Love's Enduring Promise"", etc. They have all been great, decent, family-friendly, moral films, without the language and sexual content. I would highly recommend them all for anyone's movie library."
4,wonderful movie,This a good family movie. I have read the books and it really follows it well. I was happy to see it made into a movie.
2,NOTHING like the book,"The only things right about this movie is that Willie and Missie went west, the fact that Missie was pregnant, and the names of 3 cowhands. The rest of the movie is wrong from beginning to end, the book contained no bad guys obsessed with stealing from Willie, and they did not adopt any half-grown children, nor was their baby named after Willie's dead little brother because there was no such character in the book! It is FALSE to claim this movie is based on a best-selling book, it's based so loosely on the original story that there's no connection."
5,don't let the title fool you,"sounds like a girly, tear-sobbing, modern version of Little House On The Prairie, doesn't it? Well, although it may have some of those aspects; the grunt of this story is imbedded in a young adventurous couple who have strong faith in God, and a lot of guts to make things happen in the wild west.For the traditional western fan, this movie has it all, covered wagons, indians, bad-guys, shoot-outs, cattle ranches, saloon scenes in town, etc. and so-on.this is a movie that everyone will enjoy, men, women, western fans, religeous fans, history buffs, etc."
2,Birds in the Wild,"1.-Good overall Photography but quality starts to decay after ten minutes.2.-Contrast is very poor. I do not know what did they do in postproducttion but it needs a total adjustment on chroma, video, pedestal and so on..3.-The music hits the target sometimes, but most of the time does not match the situation.4.-The narrator is not the best in the bussiness.5.-Birds are mostly shot in Afrika, but in south america there are 40% of the species and overall more than 50% in all the americas.I hope the other two episodes are better (not expecting so much)"
5,new trends in psychotherapy,"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is, at the present day, the more promising trend in psychotherapy. This book privides a wide vision and practical tools for the professional of Psychology"
3,A class album but not of its own,"For those of you who have had their lives enriched by James Grants' sensual melodies of former albums, this is a must. For those of you who have never been graced with a Love and Money album your stereos have been starved. If you want to feed your CD player buy A Strange Kind Of Love or Dogs In The Traffic, and be prepared to be whisked off to a peaceful and melodic place. This music is here to stay."
3,"Worth a look, but don't get your hopes too high","What is most astonishing is how poorly written this book--a writing reference book after all!--is. The text is full of syntax errors, run-on sentences, and muddled descriptions. Here's an example (from p. 29) containing all three: ""When John, the librarian/mystery writer I work with, grew peevish about my repeatedly saying, 'The pacing is toooooo slow,' he gave Cleveland, his PI, a friend on the force (not what you'd expect), reworked (sic) the narrative into dialogue, and went zipping on.""Still, despite the clumsiness and errors, this book has a thread that's worth hanging onto. In particular, the lists of 'story starters' offered at the end of every chapter, are like having the benefit of a daily journal for those of us who lack the discipline and diligence to maintain our own. It is a very good resource in that respect, and provided me with many idea nuggets to chew on."
3,Resourceful,Great tool to jumpstart the story writing creativity. I use it when I am blocked and can't think of a storyline. Easy to read.
3,This Is Only Ok,"I was really hoping that I would learn something new from this book. It's good for story starters like the title says. However, in a weird way the author talks to you like you were a six year old.If the writer had taken the time to work on his `ideas' and writing for the book it would have been better.However, it is a good book for some one who is starting."
1,Don't buy this.,"This book is *awful.* It's full of unconnected dribble.Can the author carry a thought through? What is shedoing writing at all, let alone writing about writing?She has a PH.d. in what?? Better to do some searchingin the deja archives about getting ideas for writing.The author seems to float in and out of dreamland. Thatmight be ok for the process of thinking up fiction, butnot for writing about writing. Now if she was going toshow me how to float in and out of dreamland, and how tomake that dreamland actually interesting, that would beanother thing. Her dreamland was boring."
5,Lovely - Lovely,Kudos to Amazon for their great gift wrapping! Totally worth the fee to have them do it. This basket is just as described and hopefully will taste as good as it looks.
2,One of the weaker books in the Emma Lord series,"When Vida Runkle discovers a distant relative has been murdered in a seaside Oregon town, she takes off to solve the mystery, dragging her employer, newspaper editor Emma Lord, with her.Although Emma Lord is the star of this series, she takes a backseat to her sidekick, Vida Runkle, in this book, and the reversal does not work well. Runkle comes across as a meanspirited, insensitive detective who shows little consideration a loyal and injured Emma Lord. Meanwhile, the author spends far too much time lecturing us on the value of family and that ""blood is thicker that water."" Combined with a weak plot, this relentless harping on family (despite the fact that Runkle has never met most of the branch of the family she is now meddling with) make this one of the least enjoyable books in the series."
3,"Enjoyable, but limited readership","As always Emma and Vida are out to solve a mystery. I enjoy this series as well as the Bed and Breakfast series that Ms Daheim writes. I have read all the books in the series and had no trouble enjoying this addition, but I feel that it would not be a good way to introduce new readers to this excellent series. Start with Alpine Advocate and then continue down the line. Following that course will allow the reader to enjoy all that has lead up to Emma and Vida's relationship and to Emma's interaction with all the characters in the series."
5,Great arrow,I did not receive the arrows I ordered from Amazon. They sent me a bi-pod shooting rest by mistake. I found the same exact arrow at Walmart for the same price. My son harvested his first bow kill deer with this arrow. The arrow was not damaged and will be used again. Flies straight and fast and at a low price.
3,"good arrows, but you don't get the color they show","I got the brand I ordered, but I ordered these specifically because I liked the colors shown in the picture. They sent me blah gray colored arrows INSTEAD but of the same good quality make. They will suffice for the function of target shooting I need them for but I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get exactly what I asked for. Next time I will spend the gas money to drive an hour into and all the way across town to pick out my arrows at the pro shop. In total with the gasoline expense the price probably evens out the same.... but I would have the colors I picked out which was part of the SELLING POINT of these online. I have learned."
5,I didn't want it to end. The characters are wonderful.,"From beginning to end, you can't wait to turn to the next page. The characters are so enchanting and you find yourself wishing that you could meet them all, especially Father Timothy. In such a short tome, there is drama, tears, laughter, romance and a delightful glimpse of a place we'd all like to see."
3,Good read - lots of humor - romance for the millenium,This is a very good book on reincarnation and the after-life. Lots of humor and a well told tale of love in the after-life. I highly recommend it for people who enjoy woo-woo type stories while also enjoying romance.
2,White Rotadent refill,This one is not very good quality. It stops in the middle of brushing if it hits the side of my mouth. I have never had this problem with the refills. Makes me want to think it is an imitation. I have to order another one but will not order from the same vendor.
1,Only my opinion,"I have been using the short point to my extreme satisfaction and thought the long point would add another dimension to the process. Wrong. It was too long and soft to make any difference. The short point is firmer and feels like it's doing the job. Using the Rotadent system has made a tremendous difference in my dental care, just ask my hygienist, she gives me an A plus."
1,"Disappointing, too light","As a professional Java developer and unless you've been living in a cave for the last several years, you certainly know about the concepts of agile/eXtreme programming such as using JUnit, refactoring, striving for simplicity etc. All that is wrapped up in the first part of this book (pp.1-128) and it is not done particularly well: The examples are kind of 'Hello World'-ish, so there's little to be learned even for beginners.The two chapters about the Spring framework and Hibernate are also rather short (pp. 129-175) and merely scratch the surface of those solutions. The documentation available on the respective websites is far superior.My conclusion: this book is largely superfluous and a waste of paper. If you really want to know about Spring, check out the website and read the superb, in-depth ""Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development"" by Rod Johnson."
1,Not even spell checked,"This book with its talk of the business ""sponser"" was not even spell checked. The code will not compile because in Java declarations are case sensitive. Whole paragraphs are repeated. The content is vague and seems to be more of a rant than an attempt to teach.Horrible. One star is generous."
2,Refactoring will not save your soul,"The book starts off well and the author makes several good points about having lighter objects and not being tied to a particular framework, but then it digresses into refactoring evangelism. Despite what this apologist believes, design cannot be neglected altogether as refactoring becomes more and more expensive as a system grows larger and parts get more complex. Just look at all the items still left over from Java 1.0 or 1.1. How many methods has Sun deprecated that are still around? Take many of the concepts to heart up to about page 50, then just chuck the rest.Design well, but have allowance for refactoring. Build smaller pieces and not monolithic objects."
5,Timely and wise,"I have spent most of the past 5 years traveling around the country talking to developers, and a constant question I hear is 'Why is Java programming so complex, especially when the Java langauge itself is clean and elegant?""It doesn't have to be that way, and Bruce Tate and Justin Gehtland can show you how. Continuing the tradition that Bruce started with his ""Bitter..."" books, BFLJ skips right past the vendor hype to the techniques that are working for good Java developers around the country. I have read all of Tate and Gehtland's fine books, and for both of them this is the best to date.Read this book now, and you'll be ahead of the curve in 2005 and 2006."
2,didn't get the right bottle,I didn't get cherry plum. I got Olive instead. Anyway maybe it's a sign from the flower essence gods that that's what I need.
4,Pretty Awesome stuff!,"I was turned onto this product by a friend of mine who is very into holistic health and how to control issues you're having with you're own life through meditation and breathing. I have control issues where I get very upset, somewhat as an anxiety attack, when things are out of my control. This product really helps though! I was getting upset over a work issue and put a few drops in a glass of water and slowly drank it. It definitely calmed me down big time! I know it could have been a placebo affect because I am in medicine and I do understand mind over matter...but I feel it really did help calm me down. A good product overall and less expensive than buying in stores."
5,Must have resource for blended families,This book has been an incredible blessing in my blended family's life. My marriage would not have survived w/out the help of this book. Read this book if you are in or thinking about entering a blended family situation.
3,Misleading jacket cover and advertisements,"While this book contains a lot of helpful information that most all stepfamilies can use, it is written from a totally Christian perspective and speaks of God and Jesus on most all of the pages. Most of the ads I've seen for this book, in addition to the book's dustjacket itself, do not tell potential buyers about the Christian slant. If you're not a Christian, don't buy this book as you'll most likely be turned off by statements such as ""We should continually seek to live as Christ lived and take on his attitude of sacrifice. The qualities of Jesus form stepping-stones..."" If you are a Christian, then you will certainly like this book."
4,KEEPER OF WISDOM,"Set in a faraway land that looks Arabian by the architecture, a town learns a lesson about the value of wisdom. A wise old woman travels to their town to sell them 12 wisdom books containing all of the knowledge of the world, but they decline. ""We have everything money can buy."" So, the woman sells her wisdom to others. But the town soon learns that wealth is ephemeral and money cannot keep the world from changing. Famine hits the country, and the mayor regrets his mistake of not investing in wisdom. The wise woman returns and sells the mayor her last book of wisdom. He then goes on a quest to the city that acquired the other 11 books of wisdom in order to learn to live wisely. The illustrations give it a dreamlike quality, and the tale may be a springboard for reflection on material values."
4,Sojoe Firepit Cover,"I bought the firepit cover for its quality, and not for the price which is higher than other covers. I had the original cover and it was for the Sojoe Firepit so I swallowed hard and bought it. This is a good cover, and you can get a whole lot more mileage out of it if you bring it in during the hot summer months when its not going to rain and the sun is not going to do it in. Quality excellent, but wish the price was a bit lower. P.S> When I read the other fireplace cover reviews it seemed that you were going to end up with a cover that would last at most a year or so and than need replacing."
4,One of Williams' best recordings!,"In addition to the excellent premiere recording of Leo Brouwer's Concerto de Toronto (which, fortunately for Brouwer fans, includes several motifs used by Brouwer in some of his previous works), John Williams provides the listener with an outstanding rendition of the much recorded El Decameron Negro. His approach to La Huida de los Amantes por el Valle de los Ecos (The Flight of the Lovers Through the Valley of the Echoes) results in some of the most sensitive and energetic playing I have heard from Williams."
4,Get a dog! Get Doglopaedia!,"easy reading and entertaining. I love the section which tell you ""What if my dog.....""Some breed dogs are not included in the book for reference, I think a revise version will be good."
3,beautiful but............could of been 5 stars,"My husband and I love the way this set looks and how the room came out. However, after washing and drying the set I was very dissappointed, I wash and dryed on gental and low to find the inside started to melt. The bumpers are now deformed and the comforter is stuck to itself. I did what I could to put it back in the crib to have it look normal because I am not buying another set. I cannot believe how cheap the material is that the filler melts when dryed on low. I would have hung out to dry had I known that."
3,Big Elephant 6 Townhall Influence,"This is a good album. I was a little disappointed that Charlie didn't give any thanks to the Elephant 6 Townhall, which nurtured him both as a musician and a person. We suffered through his dumbass posts about going to college, blatant advertisements for his band, the Foliage (their original name before the (Black) Foliage and the White Foliage), and his arrogant, snot-nosed demeanor. He even looks like a ""Dawson's Creek"" character! We all object that he wrote a song called ""Drug Song,"" which we consider to be immoral but, hey, he's an artist.Charlie should stop fighting with Half-Handed, then maybe he won't do so many drugs. Ouch my phantom limb, indeed."
3,Doesn't quite live up to my expectations,"I picked up ""Zurich"" from a music store in Maryland. The CD was pretty good all around, but I did have some qualms with it.1). You can't understand what is being said. The music overpowers the lyrics.2). The recording itself sounds a bit unprofessional, as well as muffled. At the end of ""Dreams of the Silver Moon"" you can hear an instrument being dropped or put down. At the beginning of ""Drug Song"" you can hear things going on in the background, such as a cymbal being readied.3). The players are playing a variety of instruments, but it almost seems too much, as if they are trying to get credit for every instrument they've ever played. All the different instruments make the music seem cluttered in spots.I do like the voice of the woman. Her voice is lilting and she can carry a tune very well, as well as harmonizing.If there is more to come from this duo, I will be on the lookout for it. Perhaps the sound will have matured a little more by then."
3,Wizard of Oz Yellow Brick Road Game,"It's fun, almost any game is fun but when our family plays games I like them to be more on the educational side. I feel this would be a great game for a 3 year old but it's not very stimulating for my 5 year old."
3,Rusty,"This umbrella stand is great based on the fact that it is made of cast iron. That is particularily important here in Colorado where we can have very strong winds. However, it was not painted with a rust resistant finish. I have only had the stand outside two weeks and it has already rusted on the one side that the rain has blown on it. I now have to re-paint it with a tougher finish. I find this inconvenient, yet not worth the trouble to return it."
3,sturdy but rusted after a month,"Meh- it works, but the varnish wears off after a month and it looks weatherworn. The umbrella I bought does not fit properly into this stand- the tropishade nine foot umbrella. The pole of the umbrella is too thin to fit properly in this stand, so it wobbles around. There are small holes where you should be able to put in screws, but they don't line up, so it doesn't work."
5,The Gift That Keeps on Giving!,"For Christmas, 1976, my best friend Janet gave me this double-live album set. Thirty years later, I returned the favor by giving this to her for her birthday. I told her that I was just returning the 30 years of purejoy she had given me.Loggins and Messina celebrate love and friendship with their gloriuous use of diverse instrumentation (mandolin, flutes, violins and fiddles, percussions, horns); powerful lyrics; harmonies (w/Al Garth and Lou Simms); observations of relationships and American life that with send your spirit soaring. Pay special attention to ""Golden Ribbons"" which is an ode to the lost soldiers of Vietnam, that is as poignant and meaningful today.""On Stage"" is one of the best live Rock-n-Roll albums ever recorded which still resonates today. If you want to see what two master singers/songwriters/performers do with such beauty and grace, RUN, don't walk to the checkout box and click, BY NOW!"
5,Loggins & Messina at their best.,"This is a really fine album. I used to listen to this when i was 16 yrs old. I played it over and over. I had forgot all about this album until i was browesing through amazon. So i bought it and it is still as good as i rememberd it. This is a must buy, You wont be dissapointed."
1,not what I expected,The product took forever to get to me and when it did it was in such bad shape the only place it could go was in the garbage!!! The description said that the record was in good condition - there were so many scratches it was unable to be played. I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT NO STARS!!!!
2,In Motion. . .but not going anywhere,"First, let me note I like most of the work from the David Becker Tribune and admittedly I liked this CD much more back in the early '90s. But some things don't stand the test of time: what sounded fresh and interesting then now sounds too much like the rest of the triple Z jazz genre that clogs the play lists of commercial jazz stations. Put another way, this music plays well in the background but it doesn't hold up to careful listening.Mr. Becker is a heck of a guitar player, but the synthesizers and keyboards dilute instead of enhancing the music here. It all sounds pretty much the same. I would recommend both ""Siberian Express"" and ""Third Time Around"" as better testimonies to Mr. Becker's work from the early '90s."
4,Light jazz but still has a bit of bite,"This album is walking a thin line between cool jazz fusion and easy jazz. The thing is that because of David Becker's stupendous guitar chops and interesting compositions it never really crosses into easy jazz territory.It's smooth, relaxing and accessible, but there is something there to keep you interested if you decide to switch from background listing to listening attentively. Not the best example of this kind of music, but a cool record non the less if you in the mood for something happy and light."
1,beware of this bootleg,"Despite the back cover notes stating that this recording is made live at ""Viejo Almacen"" it is not true. Atributing this recording as ""live"" has only one reason: to cover the terrible sound quality of this pirate release of the second session of ""Octeto Buenos Aires"". This recording is available on other CDs and have been rereleased many times (for evample by ANS records or by Blue Moon Records under the title ""Marron y Azul""). Moreover, the opening track is missing here too."
3,"""Summation of the Summa""","One of the greatest Catholic thinkers of the twentieth century, Etiene Gilson, discusses, interprets, and expounds, in his work ""The Elements of Christian Philosophy,"" the Philosophy of St Thomas Aquinas in terms that the educated laymen and student will find beneficial and fairly simple to soak in. This is a great summation of the ""Summa,"" and should be placed next to Ralph McInerny's work and other accomplished commentators' treatment of St Thomas' oeuvre."
1,Don't waste your $$$!,"I just returned this. I HATE it. The directions said to use it 10-12 times for optimum results and I was trying to be patient, but it doesn't remove ANY hair unless you go over the area many times. I can shave with a razor in a fraction of the time. I never got a decent shave and the last straw was when I tried to do my underarms and it cut the hell out of me. I couldn't sleep because it hurt so bad. Very disappointing."
1,Don't waste your money - here are my suggestions,"I'm going to agree with the other unimpressed reviewers - this shaver is a dud. I've used it wet with soap as recommended in the manual with little success and I've used it dry but it still barely shaved my legs and underarms.What good is a shaver that doesn't shave? I'm reminded of the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" and you should too. I admit to borrowing my boyfriend's shaver when he wasn't looking and it did a great job.If you do buy a shaver, here are the features you should look for:- Rechargeable, preferably one with a stand/base- Wet/dry usage- Titanium blade coverings- Pop up trimmer- Easy to find replacement blades when necessaryWith any shaver, your skin will need time to adjust, but this shaver isn't worth the hassle. Buy something that will do the job it's intended for."
1,Does not work,"This razor doesn't work, plain and simple. Tried several times, followed the directions, no way. Don't waste your money."
1,"don't bother, and it is a bother","I was very dissapointed. The idea is great, but it just doesn't work.I hand to go over the area so many times I felt like I was sanding instead of shaving. I just went back to ""borrowing"" my husband's!"
2,"Recharges, but doesn't Shave","I ordered a twin-blade shaver, but got a single-blade one. My account was creditted for the mixup. I kept this shaver, but it doesn't shave well at all. It might cut 1 out of 10 hairs. It will cut a little better if you turn it around backwards and shave with the little strip on the end. It recharges well, though."
4,Money saved again,"Because multiple suppliers were available, I was able to get these shades for under $40.00.Autozone, NAPA, and Bumper to Bumper were about double. True product is not one with the ""Name recognition"" of those offered by the jobbers listed, however, I fail to see little difference in quality compared to those I looked at in the stores."
4,Loving Him is the Focus,"This is a timely book dealing with the battle we all face in our minds of where our focus is, what the truth is, and dealing with reality as it really is, both earthly and heavenly. It is refreshingly practical and guides the reader to take a good look at the truth of the past, present, and future. Having just completed a women's Bible class using this book, the only criticism is that there was too much looking at us, not enough at God. We do need to recognize the reality of our own lives, especially to be able to find freedom, but if we are to love Him with all our minds and see the beauty of walking each day with Him, I found the focus not to be quite as consistently upward as most of her other books."
3,Growth and Study Guide,"The way it was stated on the website, I thought that it was the book with the growth and study guide. So it was not what I wanted. I needed the book to finish a Bible study. So it was a waste of money."
3,Howell Equine Handbook of Tendon and Ligament Injuries,"Found this book very basis, mostly common knowledge among horsepeople. Would be a good book for the first time horse owner, otherwise not very helpful."
2,Wholly inadequate,"I am really startled that 9 out of 12 people gave this book a 5-star rating. It reads much more like a pamphlet than a book and, if I had to guess, I'd say the author wrote it in a couple of afternoons off the top of her head. Lameness in horses is a huge topic and it deserves substantial consideration, not a mishmash of whatever happened to pop into a vet's head at the time she was at the typewriter.I would instead recommend ""Lameness: Recognizing and Treating the Horse's Most Common Ailment,"" which I purchased immediately after realizing that the Howell book was so lacking. It's a few bucks more and has about 10 times the information."
2,Disappointed,"This book is very, very basic. I bought it because I thought it would go into more depth and cover more topics. It skims the surface and nothing more. I was disappointed by it."
5,It's hard to find old Interplak brushes,It's getting hard to find brushes for the older style Interplak Tooth brushes. These were exactly what I was looking for and at a great price too!
4,Smile!,Make sure you only use gel toothpaste with this toothbrush. The paste toothpaste will cause the heads to sieze up.I have had this toothbrush for nearly 2 years with no other problems.... but I have been getting great check-ups at the dentist since using!
1,"Doesn,t fit all Conair/Interplak twist on electric brushes","Conair Interplak Replacement Heads Bonus PackThe write up says that it will fit all Conair Interplak bruches except for the push-on models. Not true, I have a NT7 model and these brushes do not fit. Amazon will accept back and said it will pay for sending them back, as well as refunding the original shipping cost."
4,pity that this model of the interplak is being phased out,"The brush heads work fine. For those who say performance is not so hot, try changing the battery in your toothbrush. Even rechargable batteries don't last forever, and when they are old, the brush heads perform poorly. (Note, however, that there are two versions of the battery for this same model of toothbrush and one is physically ""wired on"" while the other is easily removed.)All in all, it really is too bad that this model of electric toothbrush is being phased out. The Interplak model which works with these heads is far superiour to most of the ""new and improved"" models coming on to the market."
1,These don't work well,"Needing more brush heads for my Interpalk, I found these on Amazon. I proptly ordered them, and noce we received them, my wife found that they worked quite poorly. It was as if the motor in the base couldn't power the new brushes properly. They would slow down or stop completely. The old heads that we have still work fine. We just thought we'd get some extras. Hope I can send these back for a refund. Another reviewer seemed to have the same problem. So, one star, because it fit perfectly on on my base. No stars beyond that, because what use is a brush head that works only half the time?"
1,"Expensive, old, do not fit my Conair electric toothbrush",The replacement heads for my Conair electric toothbrush that I bought on Amazon were not only expensive (30 dollars per a pack of 3) but also were old and obsolete.They do not fit my Conair toothbrush because they were made for a model that was discontinued 10 years ago or more.I wish I could return them for a refund.
3,I prefer newer electric toothbrush models,"Not as good as the round Braun brushes, or the Sonicare system."
5,Dealing with Electric Toothbrushes,"I am hooked on the Interplak Electric toothbrush system, ever since it first came out a million years ago. I used to be able to find replacement heads in the drugstores or the stores that sold the orignal units. Now, they are nowhere in my area and if it weren't for Amazon carrying them, I would have to resort to the old fashioned do-it-yourself brushes. I have tried other brands of these power brushes and can't find any that make my mouth feel as good."
1,erroneous claim,advertised on the net that these heads fit twist on conair interplak toothbrushes. did not fit; USELESS. Wasted my money. Feel it was mis-advertised..
1,Recommended Replacement Heads Did Not Go With Toothbrush Ordered,"These replacement heads were recommended to go with a certain Interplak toothbrush I was buying, but did not fit with the toothbrush ordered. Very annoying! I had to return the heads, but also returned the toothbrush because it had practically no cleaning power! Go with Oral B."
2,These don't last very long!,Old technology and don't last the recommended 3 months between brush changes...they seize and cannot be repaired.
5,A MUST HAVE!,"I am currently following the Body for Life Program. The program is great but I needed more information. Body building 101 provided me with so much more information! Not just the ""how's"" but the ""whys"". Had it not been for this book I'm sure I would have ultimately given up my program for lack of knowledge and understanding. Anyone who is new to body building, this book is a must have!"
5,Even helps those of us past 40!,"I don't know what happens, but my body changed when I hit my mid-40's. I've bought the Total Gym, Body By Jake and Larry North products and while they are good at some things, they don't give you all the answers. For me, Bodybuilding 101, by Robert Wolff, Ph.D., does.I'm very critical about these kinds of books since so many of them proclaim they know all the answers to your problems. Why is it that all these products and people you see late at night keep telling us the abs are the key to a long happy, healthy life? Yeah, right.Here's what I really enjoy about this book; it doesn't pretend to be something that it's not. Meaning, it's not a fad diet or exercise book. The exercises, workouts and advice are the results of what Robert Wolff says have worked for people all over the world. And by following his tips I couldn't agree more.My advice is don't buy this book unless you want great results. It'll work for anyone, it really will."
3,Ok,I thought it had some good advice but not enouth descriptions of exercises - so you kind of need to supplement it with something else.
4,It's good but not enouph,"the book is great, it shows everything that a persones need to know about bodybuilding. exept for the begginers chapter,it didnt cover different routiens and it didnt show how to change the exercies routiens.It didnt talk a bout the suplement peramed, which i think each begginer should know. Put over all it's agreat book and it's worth its price in silver."
3,"This is NOT a great book, but it is a good book.","I am an intermediate bodybuilder and have read Bodybuilding 101 by Robert Wolff. It is a good general review and offers helpful recommendations.It lacks a specifc anatomical chart identifing muscles and muscle groups, which I would find helpful during training. Additionally some (many) exercises are described narratively but lack ""how to"" photos or diagrams. I found myself trying new routines and wondering if I was doing the excerise correctly.It is comprehensive, easy to read and motivational. More explict information and advice on how to do every exercise correctly and a basic anatomical chart would have been useful.Thank you."
3,Just like all the others,"This book is ok. It doesnt get real indepth on nutrition. It repeats itself a lot. My opinion, the body for life book by bill phillips is much better. My wife and I have been working out for years and were stuck. Following the body for life program we lost a total of about 85lbs between the both of following the body for life program in about 8 months. We are much more define than we were ever before."
2,"Disappointed - it says do it, but doesn't say how to do it.","I bought this book recently and I'm disappointed at it. It only has one page with the exercise plan just listing the exercises you should do in the beginning phase. But, IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN HOW TO PERFORM THEM. It only shows pictures of just some of the exercises he lists. All in all, buy this book for advice and stories about the weight training life rather than how to do it."
1,Awful experience,"We use this HP 5550c scanner at my work. Or rather, we attempt to use this scanner at work.The 5550c scanner jams whenever we try to feed more than two or three pages at a time. Then the feeder has a deathgrip on the document when you're trying to pull the document out.We've been scanning our checks at work before electronically depositing them. It's scary when you almost rip a check because the stupid scanner won't let go of it.Basically, it's a horrible waste of your money. Everyone in my department HATES it. We can't wait to replace it!"
2,Expensive Crap,"It's a beautiful phone.... that broke down shortly after using it.It's a decorative piece that gets compliments. For the price,.. it should work better."
4,Crosley Retro Phone,Awesome phone wish had the Retro ringtone as well but looks great on the wall not hard to hang either. Took 5 mins to install out of the box!
3,"Cool, but very TOYish","So it's really too much plastic, the ""rotary"" is all show, and it's smaller than the real ones were, but for a game room or something it's fun to look at."
3,"Nice, but kinda cheap...","Nice reproduction, but made out of cheap looking plastic. Ring tone is modern style, instead of old fashioned ring."
4,A plastic-take on an old classic,"I love the look of this phone but was surprised that is is almost entirely plastic and does not have that 'heavy' authentic feel to it. Despite, this phone is charming and doubles as a bank. When you drop a coin in the slot you can hear an old fashioned CLING. My toddler quickly wore the cling out but it still gets many compliments. Easy to hang on a wall and fun to talk on. Satisfactoy quality overall."
3,Crosley 1950's Pay Phone,"I thought the phone would have been built tougher- it's all plastic. It looks and works good, I only hope it holds up over the long run. For the price I would have thought they could of used a light-weight metal."
4,very nice,"This phone is pretty cute and visitors to my house love the way it looks. About the only thing I would want to change is the ringer which should sound more old bell style, it has a pretty weak electronic ""ring"".Oh and the reviews I read prompted me to buy a different and longer cord, but the one that came with it is just fine and reaches our counter 6 feet away with no problems."
4,I buy this for a gift,It was a perfect gift for a married friends... they loved it. The delivery of the phone was on time and the phone works very good!!! It's a great and beautiful product.
1,Crossley 1950s broken after 3 days,"I was very happy to own this vintage phone (even though it's not cheap) and pleased at how easy it was to install and use. But after three days, it conked out. I hardly used it -- maybe a total of two outgoing calls and three received calls -- until it went totally unusable. I checked and rechecked the wires. Plugged and unplugged them. Most of the time you could hear the dial tone even when it's not being used. If I try calling it, it would ring but whoever takes the call won't hear me or vice versa. Hanging up would just make the phone launch its ""busy tone"" which is audible even when the hand/mouth piece is back on the cradle. Now, it just stands in a corner gathering dust. I'm based overseas so returning it may not be worth the extra cost and hassle. It looks great (though I'm disappointed that the body is 90% plastic!) but the quality is not."
3,Only one problem...,"I love this phone, even it's plastic colored parts. When the phone arrived, it did not have a key for the bank at the bottom. Amazon wanted me to return it for a replacement instead of the manufacturer just sending me a key. I then received a message that the manufacturer was out of stock. Since I really wanted the phone for the look, I kept it. I just can't use the bank part."
5,Great gift!,"I bought this for my sister's ""rumpus room"" - - seemed she & her husband had everything else (pool table, foosball table, poker supplies, etc.). The phone fits in great with the feel of the room, my sister and brother-in-law love it, its well-made & attractive, and to top it all off, it encourages their guests to leave tips! :-)"
4,I like my phone,"Like everyone else wish it were a little heavier, also wish that you had to put money in to make a call LOL. But I really like it and have gotten many compliments on it."
5,Great New/Old Phone,"Crosley CR56 1950's Pay Phone - Brushed ChromeLooks great hanging on the wall. It also works well. Earpiece is clear. No feedback from mouthpiece to earpiece (I've had that happen with some phones before). It's fairly lightweight. I wasn't expecting that. It looked heavier online. The body of the phone is plastic, but seems to be of good quality. I recommend this one."
2,Pay phone,"It lloks great and is a wonderful conversation starter. However, the volume is so quiet you cant hear out of the reciever. I love the look I really wish it had not pooped on us after only a month"
4,50's phone,Cutest phone ever! I placed it on the wall in my 50's inspired media room. The only downfall is it's made out of plastic. Looks authentic and is a great center of conversation. Overall I am pleased and would recommend it to anyone.
4,Great classic Scofield,"This is a great Scofield disc. I like John's recent funk outings, but this disc from further back in his career really outlines his jazz playing in a more fusion-like setting."
1,Back at Best Buy,"I was in Best Buy and I saw this only lacking the bogus ""Collector's Tin"" and the head set for 30$."
3,mostly human,"Althou there are some ""silly"" animal shots, most are humans, especially skier and other atheletes. Don't buy it for the animal lover."
2,There is way better,"It looks and feels like any old file rack. But, and I should have known this from the picture, if you put a heavier file in the top shelf the whole thing will fall off you desk...just saying....."
5,Excellent,"good product with high quality, very useful if you are a student or office man/lady. It can help you well organize your documents."
4,Great introduction to the discipline of fasting,"More of a booklet than a full-length book, this is a terrific little primer on the discipline of fasting and prayer. Referencing examples of Bible heroes--including Daniel, Jesus and Moses--Derek Prince explains the principles of fasting. He also gives practical advice on how to begin and end a fast.If you or your church is considering a fast for any reason, this is a good resource. It is a quick, easy read, but helpful in understanding what fasting is all about."
2,"Not impressive for fasting book, not worth it.","I do fast regularly, and this book was so sub par to what is out there by Alan Cott, and others."
5,"Just as shown, excellent toy and fun for my 1 1/2 year old grandchild.",My Grandchild loves it and it is a very nice toy. Perfect for little ones and the colors are very attractive to younger children.
3,They are ok for my 14 mo old.,We got these for my 14 mo old for Christmas. The good - they are light and the perfect size for him. A good 'starter' set. The bad - not convinced they are that durable. Who knows how long they will last.
4,Great Play Set But A Little Flimsy,"We ordered this for my 2 year old son who recently received his first play kitchen. Since his grandparents bought him some play food that has completely taken over our play room (I believe that the food must only come in 200 or less packs just to see how many parents can keep track of all of the pieces) I wanted a cooking set that had just enough pieces but not too many more. My son loves this item. He cooks w/the pots and pans and has learned what to do with the tea kettle. My only complaint is that the within an hour, somehow the potato masher broke off of the handle. It was held on by little clips, I believe and part of one of the tiny clips just snapped off. Luckily there were plenty more pieces to keep him busy. Great for little hands."
2,Just Okay,"The cooking set is just okay. The lid doesn't fit on the pan correctly. The play set is a little cheap looking,and for the price I wish I would've got a different set. My 2 yr old does love it, but we'll have to see how long it lasts."
3,could be better,"I thought it would be made a bit better. It is made in China. They are cute, but not worth the cost and very small. But for a 2 year old, I am sure she will have fun, but may not last that long."
4,cookware set,"Goes along with the toy kitchen for the twoyear old that likes to ""cook"". Only bad part is its another thing to pick up...."
3,"Ok, but cheap","I bought this for my 22 months old girl. Is ok, but the quality is on the cheap side. I think for the price, there has to be something better."
3,"Wrong Melba Moore, Joseph!","Joseph, we love you for many years of RazorMaid brilliance, but I must mention to the three or so people in the world who care that the version of ""You Stepped into My Life"" here is unfortunately the original album version, not the 12-inch mix by John Luongo, which was seven minutes-plus and much, much improved. The version on the ""Club Epic"" series is also incorrect, so the Luongo mix is unissued on CD.But we still love you, Joseph!"
5,Classic Quest!!!!,Classic remixes from ATCQ. If you don't know now you know. I've been looking for this album since 95 and I finally got my hands on it. Classic remixes of all the classic hits from this legendary hip hop group.
4,Not too bad for the price...,"I bought this computer (package deal at Best Buy) for my use at home. I am returning to school to finish my Bachelor's degree and it has everything I need. I agree that the graphics and sound card are slightly lacking, but I am not too much of a techno-wiz to worry about that stuff. I use it for my school work, reports, presentations, and listening to CDs. The computer is very quiet and pretty fast for what I have used it for. (...)I don't like the fact that Microsoft Office is not incuded. You have a trial version on it, but you have to ""convert"" it within 60 days or it won't work anymore. Plus, the Virus Scan program is a trial version as well. Other than that, it is working great. Very good features and size (200GB hard drive is WAY more than I'll ever need) make it a good bargain for home use."
3,A hair puller rather than clipper....buy a WAHL instead!!!,"I've tried both the WAHL-brand hair clipper set as well as this Conair one, and the WAHL is definitely much better. The WAHL gives you a smooth cut and trim whereas the Conair often feels as if it is pulling your hair rather than cut it. You may have a painful experience if you purchase this Conair set. I would advise any of you to buy a WAHL or try something different rather than this set.The only thing I didn't really mind was the hair clips you add to the clipper; those can be placed on a WAHL clipper as well. But even WAHL makes the clipper attachments better.I'd stress for you to buy a good set from the start, rather than buy this and then buy another later. I haven't tried the Remmington so I cannot advise you with respect to that."
2,user,"Owned for 2.5 years. Finaly broken. ""The Conair often feels as if it is pulling your hair rather than cut it""- totaly agree."
1,pulled my son's hair,"My son is almost 3yrs old and gets his hair cut every 4-5 weeks so I thought I'd try it myself. It appears to be a great deal, only 14.99$ with lots of attatchments plus comb and scissors. The blades would not stay aligned and it PULLED my son's hair more than it cut. He was crying and screaming. I reread the directions several times. I finally gave up, returned it the next day, and made a trip to the hairdresser. Thank goodness he was not traumatized from the experience and let the hairdresser cut his hair!"
3,Just OK,"The clipper is much bigger and heavier than I expected. I found it technically complicated to use; it needs to be oiled regularly (oil comes with the clipper), two pieces on the clipper need to be aligned (mine never gets aligned!), and it needs to be adjusted with a screwdriver to the voltage level in your residence (otherwise, an uncomfortable click sound comes every time turned on). Unfortunately, these things are not mentioned on the seller's web site.Other than those, the clipper works (mine doesn't pull hair, but I don't use it for haircut). Its price is very reasonable (I paid $15). But, you may want to check other brands with comparable prices."
4,Fully satisfied with a product,"I have no complains regarding haircut kit. It is fully operational, good components, exact, smooth cutting. Overall good value for offered price."
1,"TRASH , GARBAGE",THIS PRODUCT FLAT OUT SUCKS IVE BEEN SHAVING MY HEAD FOR YEARS AND NEVER HAD ISSUES WITH CLIPPERS HAD A BASIC REMINGTON BEFORETHIS PRODUCT GIVES ME NOTHING BUT TROUBLE
3,Great for pet grooming,"I use this Conair HC240D for my pet's grooming, and it has been useful. For the price I pay I am very satisfied with the result. My dogs are Maltese who has long hair so I need to cut the hair quiet often. So far, the blade on this product still works great :) For a cheap price, I would recommend this."
4,a wonderful surprise,I've decided to buy this record after having read the name of the singer of a wonderful song in last Rojksoop album (song: what else is there) and looking on the web i've found that this singer has her own group (the knife) so i bought the cd only on a wave of interest not knowing what I'm going in...this cd is a wonderful surprise and now (in march) a new cd will be published... surely a must buy!!!
5,A must for a serious reader as an introduction on Unix,Meghabghab has a made this book easy to read. It explains the concepts of Unix in clear terms. It expounds the basic concepts that must be in every Unix book. It introduces shells and how to use them in a Unix environment. Also it has a chapter on C programming language and how to run C on a Unix machine. It helps not only average users but also system administrators to masterfully control a Unix machine. In every chapter important commands that are pertinent to the topic at hand are explained in a releavnt example. Meghabghab has scored big in an introductory book on Unix which is a must for any serious reader on Unix.
1,Horrible!,This is not worth your money. I was able to use it for a matter of 5 seconds before it quit. Between having to unclog it and trying to get it to work....we used rollers. Definately not worh buying.
1,Don't,"This booklet was written by me in 1969 for the Atomic Energy Commission. It is, of course, totally out of date. It was given away free at the time it was written. What the University Press of the Pacific has done is to claim that this title is in the public domain and with no input from me has republished the same 1969 edition which was some eighty pages and is selling it for a rather high price considering what it is. This practice may or may not be legal depending on what the copyright situation really is-something I am investigating. But is it ethical?"
5,Words flew off the page and wrapped around my soul.,"Not since Andrea Dworkin's ""Woman Hating"" (that I read in 1978) have I been so moved by the truth of another writer that I would want to emulate it. In sharing Harris's vision of writing as an ""uncompromising revolutionary act"" the point is made that the mainstream literary world as well as the ""so-called avant-garde and burgeoning feminist critical aristocracy"" will not appreciate the lesbian writer who ""refuses to obey the rules."" To both women, nothing is more important than telling the truth, ""refusing all categories, all who would shape your writing to their own use.""""Yes!"" I cried, "" The End."
1,Not what I expected.,"Had heard a cut on the radio and it was so lovely it prompted me to order the CD. However, the entire CD did not measure up to the beautiful first cut I originally heard. Too much dissonance, chaos, amidst a too few pleasing pieces. a disapointment."
3,not bad,"not bad, bad it worked exactly as advertised. It was a little bit confusing but i was able to install my DEH 80 PRS using this kit on my 01 Audi TT."
3,Be more specific!,This is the correct harness but many audi came with the bose sound system and this harness will NOT work with that system in place. Had to order from a different company to finally find the correct harness. Had I known this I wouldnt have wasted my money on the completely wrong item.
5,a wonderful gift,"I purchased this set for my in-laws. They told us they liked it, and I saw it out on their counter last time I visited. This set can be used for an appetizer for a regular family dinner or for a more formal party. I own this set in the grape collection, and I highly recommend both."
5,Thelma,"This is a great book, written in typical early 20th century style. It has excellent use of descriptive language with vivid word painting, excellent pathos and an intricate yet well put together plot. Recommended reading for those who like books that combine romance and adventure."
5,Great journal- just don't order it from Amazon,"""The first issue should arrive in 12-16 weeks."" Sure, why not? The ROM is a quarterly, after all.But after six months- and after your ""Where's my subscription?"" e-mails get ignored- you look at this part that you neglected to pay enough attention to before: ""Cancellation: This magazine subscription cannot be canceled or refunded.""And then you realize Amazon has stolen your money, and is quite satisfied with that state of affairs.Not only that, but when you click on the ""Read more"" button, you get a pop-up announcing that ""Some publishers of professional or trade magazine subscriptions do not allow cancellations."" Therefore, avers Amazon, adding insult to injury, 'tis not we but the Review who have robbed thee.The Review of Metaphysics has a toll-free number through which you can order directly. Use it. Avoid being robbed by Amazon."
2,Disappointment,"The ""dramatic"" dome does not keep out rain. There's a hole for the chain at the top! Rain invariably seeps in, so that the seed at the bottom, where the birds feed, rots. Even though this feeder holds so much, I sometimes have to take it down before it's empty to clean it. Admitedly, I live in Georgia, and we get torrential downpours. If you get only light showers, or live in a dry region, this may be the feeder for you.However, the perches on the feeder are plastic, and are once again worn or broken. No one seems to want to stock them, so I'm on the internet looking for some. Amazon does not have them either. I'll continue my search. At some point, I'll continue my pathetic search for the perfect feeder."
2,"Yep, it's squirrel proof, but basically bird proof, too!",The birds have to sit on a tiny plastic perch then stick their heads into a hole to get to the food. Have had the feeder up for over a month and the birds haven't been able to empty even half the food. Think I'll go back to the old feeder for the winter so the poor things don't starve. This was an expensive mistake.
3,Doves can't access,My poor white winged dove tries to get seed from this feeder but is unable because the roof is too low - I wanted to deter squirrels not doves! I have now sent off for the expensive deep tray which attaches on the bottom but am not convinced this will solve the problem.
4,Bird Feeder,We have always had a problem with squirrels getting the bird seed even though I feed the squirrels. This is our second feeder and it works the best. I had to move it twice because a squirrel was able to jump higher then the instructions said. I have a thick wire hanging down from a branch. I did have to use dowells to increase the length of the purches. Now I have four birds feeding most of the time with others waiting in near by trees for their turn. It has great capacity.
5,Uri Burton,Excellent work. First class historical research: author knows his period. A literary thriller. Very good tecnique: the story is told by characters and author sticks to one point of view in each section without ever switching from one point of view to another. Very interesting characters.
4,Can anyone answer my question?,I have been trying to find out 2 things.#1 are the leg rests on this stroller adjustabel?#2 How far does if recline?If anyone can answer it would be really helpful. I can't seem to find the information anywhere and I can't seem to find the stroller is any store!! Thanks.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this stroller a few months ago for my two boys, ages one and two, based on the reviews I read here. Although it looks nice, I have found it very inconvenient to use. Of course, all double strollers are heavier than singles, but I found this one to be particularly heavy and cumbersome. It doesn't fold up or open easily at all, and takes up a significant amount of space in its resting position. The metal folding joints are always pinching my fingers. The hoods pop off constantly, and I have found that I really miss the child trays and adult cupholders on the singles. My boys are of average size, but always look very cramped next to each other, and can never wait to get out of this stroller. Although more expensive, I may try the Peg Perego Aria Twin...it is considerably lighter and appears much easier to fold/unfold."
3,It's okay,"This stroller is only okay and when considering the price is actually not great. Not particularly easy to fold and it's pretty heavy. I bought the stroller for a plane trip and had to pack the sun shades in my suitcase because they pop off when you fold the stroller up. I wasn't willing to risk having them end up getting lost somewhere between Indianapolis and Phoenix. Locking the stroller into it's folded position is a huge pain. The stroller is narrow, seems comfortable for the kids (they fell asleep at times) and steers fairly well. I also have a Mounain Buggy double and nothing compares to it for steering. The Mountain Biggy was too big to gate check so next time I would probably get a cheap umbrella twin and if the airlines trash it who cares."
1,It lasted 3 months,"I liked the convenience of this stroller, the size and side by side option, HOWEVER, it did not stand up to everyday use. (note that it did not come with instructions) The front brakes no longer work so the only way I can get it to move is by pulling it. It has bends in several places and no longer folds properly. This is from only getting my 20lb and 30lb children and getting it in and out of the car, also 1 airplane ride. I am disappointed in the quality. I paid $250 and feel like I wasted my money."
3,"Interesting, but not essential","Spellfire is an intersting supplement to the Forgotten Realms, but it is much too powerful for the usual Player. If you're interested, this book is a good accessory, but limited use in any usual campaign"
4,Another great look at the Roman Empire and Christianity,"This one is a sequel to the Robe and does it justice, taking up where the last film let off.Victor Mature plays an ex-slave and Christian who has the Robe of Jesus, an item that the emperor Caligula believes has magical powers over life and death.A wonderful movie about faith but I don't believe you have to be a particularly religious person to enjoy it."
4,The way a sequel should be,"This is a sequel to ""The Robe"" and introduces some themes that are harder to accept. Demetrius asks God to help his love escape (rape or worse), and God apparently takes her life. At that point he loses faith, denies his Lord and pursues taking things into his own hands. He isn't happy, although he fills his life with accolades and physical pleasures. Sent by the mad emperor to retrieve the robe of Christ, he finds that his lady love actually alive - in some kind of shock / coma. He realizes how he has betrayed Jesus and repents. The girl comes out of it and he gos back to face the emperor without the robe."
4,A good sequel,"This movie is a good sequel to The Robe. If you enjoyed The Robe, you'll enjoy this movie, too. It's good entertainment, but it is not an epic film by any means.In essence, the story is Demetrius grieves for Marcellus and Diana and begins to doubt God. Later, he is captured and turned into a gladiator who won't fight. That is, he won't fight until he's motivated to by a series of manipulations by a woman. He then turns his back on God until Peter works with him to bring him back to the faith.The cinematography and sets are very similar to The Robe, almost like they were shot at the same time. What you expect/see from the first you'll see here."
4,The sequel to another movie called...,'The Robe'; another great show. I enjoy the movie immensely and heartily recommend it to all lovers of Hollywood when it didn't suck -in the past few years now- big failings now.
3,Good as Sequels go-,"I own this film on vhs, and although it`s not one of my favorites, it`s definately worth viewing.Actually one of the few sequels that`s better than the origional story, with a lot more action than The Robe. Demetrius and the Gladiators follows up on what happened to Demetrius, the slave of Marcellus (Richard Burton) in The Robe. Portayed by Victore Mature with gusto and zest.With another hammy performance by Michael Rennie as Caligula. Look for the scene towards the end, where Mature fights off three or four gladiators single handed.Reminicent of the more recent blockbuster, ""Gladiator."" Watch and enjoy."
4,Demetrius and the Gladiators,Well produced and well acted film. Jay Robinson makes a splendid Caligula.
3,Demetrius!Demetrius!,"Demetrius and the Gladiators not only deals with issues on love and ancient Roman life, but it also deals with biblical context.Following the film THE ROBE Demetrius becomes tested by unnerving odds to go against his God and all that he believes in.The film has its slow moment but in all it is a film the whole family will enjoy watching."
5,Demetrius and The Gladiators,Great old movie. Great sequel to The Robe. Too badthese days people are afraid to make good quality movies like these especiallybecause of the Wonderful biblical content and references to Jesus Christ The Savior of the world.
2,Terrible DVD quality,"Demetrius and the Gladiators is an enjoyable film (see other reviewers for details) but the film quality on the DVD sucks! No effort was made to restore the film and it shows in it's very fuzzy quality. What a shame, and a ripoff to the consumer. No extras either."
4,Demetrius and the Gladiators,Very good movie. The package arrived earlier than expected. The qualiy was very good but it could have been remastered.
4,A Cinematic Classic,"A classic movie with a classic cast. Victor Mature and Susan Hayward shine in this 1950s classic movie about faith, love, temptation, and undying truth. True, it is not an Oscar Best Picture like ""Casablanca"" or ""Gone with the Wind,"" but it does contain just as much action, memorable quotes and classic stars (Susan Hayward, Debra Paget, Anne Bancroft, and Ernest Borgnine) the real icons of Hollywood cinema."
4,Demetrius and the Gladiators,Victor Mature gives us a multifaucted performance. In this moveie the costumes were glamorous like the 10 Commandments. the one with Charlton heston. The scenery was not opulant but not sparse. I recommend this movie. It starts out slow but builds up so keep watching.
4,Ave Demetrius!,"What is it about ancient Imperial Rome that fascinates us so much? Is it the Bacchanalian orgies; the despotic rulers drunk with power; the gladiatorial jousts? ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" is all this and, perhaps quite a bit more. Picking up the narrative thread where ""The Robe"" left off, Demetrius, a free man, is enslaved once more for striking a Roman officer. Pressed into service as a gladiator he rises to the rank of a Praetorian Guard in defiance of the mad emperor Caligula. Demetrius catches the eye of the scheming Messalina and together they plot to depose the emperor who meets a timely end at the hands of the Praetorian Guard as the new faith, Christianity, prevails. Cashing in on the scope films of the early Fifties and late Sixties, ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" is handsomely presented in this limited edition hi-def/Blu-ray."
5,Wonderful sequel to The Robe,My mother bought me this movie along with The Robe. Both are great movies. Superb acting and great messages! Even the kids will enjoy it!
3,Demetrius and the Gladiators Limited Edition Series,"I received Demetrius and the Gladiators 3 days after my order was placed with expedited shipping, and in new condition.The product description states that English subtitles is provided. A reviewer here on Amazon says no English subtitle is provided, and he is right, there is NO SUBTITLE in English. I can't understand why they can't provide English subtitles in this day and age of the Blu Ray disc, and at this price. I really need to have it.My apology to the Reviewer.As for the blu ray quality of Demetrius, it is just OK, it does not live up the the name of Blu Ray, only DVD quality.This is a limited edition of 3,000 copies, is there a copy serial number? I don't see any!"
3,"Remember, each person has a different taste!","I had forgotten just how bad that movie was! Watcheda little of it! Anyway, to each his own, others maylike it! I would give it a 3*"
5,The Greatest Naval Battle of All Time,"LEYTE is the story of what many consider to be the greatest naval battle of all time and it is also a tale which focuses on some of the most famous personalities of World War II such as MacArthur, Nimitz, Halsey, Stillwell, Arnold and Lemay.Morison had a small but capable staff assisting him in his research efforts for this book as well as the other volumes in the series. One of his staff members actually sailed up to Leyte in Vice Admiral Wilkinson's flagship. In 1950 Morison himself visited Japan and discussed the Battle for Leyte Gulf with leading Japanese participants.LEYTE is one of the most important studies in the HISTORY OF UNITED STATES NAVAL OPERATIONS IN WORLD WAR II."
3,Strawberry gets Melty,My husband lives by these bars. Just to note (especially in the summertime): I ordered the Strawberry and Chocolate Peanut Butter. The Strawberry melted into a gooey mess after it had been shipped. The Chocolate ones held up very nicely mostly because there was no 'fruit spread' in it.
5,Husband Loves These,"My husband has a real sweet tooth but we are getting older and he doesn't handle carbs very well anymore. These bars are low in carbs and high in protein...nice combination. He can have a bar with his oatmeal McCann's Irish Oatmeal, Quick Cooking, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)for breakfast and he is good for several hours. No more highs and lows from sugary treats. He loves the double chocolate. Yes, the bars do require you to drink water, but I think that is a double bonus."
2,taste awful...,it may be good if you don't bother about the its taste. I bought this ready for camping but had tried 1 bar before I leave. It's taste tooooooo sweettttttt and you need drink a lot of water for this bar. I left it at home and get a different brand which is great taste...
1,"Tastes bad, doesn't look fresh",Don't be fooled by the low price... not worth it imo. I wouldn't eat it even if I got it for free.
1,bad taste strawberry chhesecake...,nasty bar... even though this is my first ever protein bar. It tasted pretty awful. I would get other flavor.
5,The finest series on the Old West,"Time Life Books made history when they made the Old West series. The Gunfighters,The Texans,The Indians,The Great Chiefs,The Spanish West, The Mexican War I all have as well as The End and The Myth. These books explain things and tell amazing stories. I highly recomend this series."
5,Made my dad smile,This book is a great gift for anyone who loves the Western Days. The pictures are clean and crisp. The cover (Leather-like) vinyl with grooves and indentions like on a saddle. Very well put together. Makes an excellent gift for any Western savvy individual. My dad sure liked it and then some!
1,horrible book,"This book was absolutely lame, a complete waste of time to read. No good tips, nothing of value. Buy or check out of the library a different book. I will also steer clear of other books by the same authors. They must be old and out of touch with today's world and job market."
2,No Difficult Puzzles,"The most difficult puzzles in the book (marked ""Vexing"" and ""Truly Killer"") were **way** too simple. They would be intermediate in other books."
5,Fun book,"The book was what I had expected. I am up to puzzle 88 out of 120 and so far none have been particularly difficult - however, they get progressively harder so there will undoubtedly be some challenges to come."
2,Too easy; good for killer sudoku beginners,"I became interested in killer sudoku after I came across a handful of puzzles in Will Shortz's sudoku world championship book. I got bored of regular sudoku because it got kind of monotonous. Killer sudoku is a lot more fun and satisfying, and you really have to think to crack hard puzzles. Conversely, at least in my view, the key to solving regular sudoku is just staring at a puzzle until you find a hole.I was looking forward to getting this book after I finished all of the puzzles in Killer Sudoku: The Deadly New Dimension. Unfortunately, I found the puzzles in the book too easy. Even many of the puzzles in the ""harder"" sections -- Challening and Vexing, for example -- can be solved in under 10 minutes.In this book, the puzzles just aren't challenging. If you want to try to killer sudoku for the first time, I would recommend this book. If you want something a little tougher, get the Deadly New Dimension."
3,Lightweight but difficult to push,"This vacuum is indeed as advertised: lightweight and powerful. The problem is that the suction is so powerful that the vacuum is extremely difficult to push around. The so called ""automatic height adjustment"" feature just doesn't do much. So if you need to vacuum say a shag, you better have some muscles on you. I would consider upgrading to the model which has a manual height adjustment feature. The motor is quite loud, but my previous Hoover upright was even louder. Also the cord could have used another 5-10 ft. Why do they cheap out like that?"
2,OK,Its very inexpensive and OK job of cleaning. VERY noisy but lightweight. I use it now to clean the car interior as it doesn't bother anyone that way.
2,Not So Lite,"My mom had an earlier version of this she bought used for $20. and had for years. She wouldn't let me spend more, and liked what she had. The problem has been the belt for the roller breaking. I've bought 5 belts in about 2 years. Without the roller, the vacuum is heavy and difficult to move around, but I'm done buying belts."
1,LOUD,This is the loudest vacuum cleaner I have ever heard. Not only is it loud it doesn't do a very good job. If you use the hose for anything don't be surprised to now find dirt under the regular vacuum part. I would suggest only buying this to use out in a shop or somewhere that you don't mind if it is loud and doesn't do a great job.
4,Good little vacuum,"I really like this little vacuum. Seems to hold suction, it's light and easy to manuever. I only have a little carpet in the house so I don't need a mega machine, just something to keep the bedroom carpets clean."
3,They should give you a pair of good earplugs with this!,"Good suction. Good price...but noisy as can be...I have never heard a vacuum this loud. Still, not going to send it back coz it would cost me more than it's worth. It does work well so I guess I will just wear earplugs when I use it!"
2,Good the 6 months it lasted,"First the on/off switch stopped working. No problem, it broke in the ""on"" position so I could just plug it in when I wanted to use it. Now the brush isn't rotating and it doesn't clean at all. I looked up the shipping costs - about $20 to return it since it is out of the Amazon warranty period.Bought this for my lower level so I wouldn't have to haul my other heavier vacuum up/down the stairs. The lower level only has guest rooms so the vacuum doesn't see much use. It did work very well until it broke. Previously I had a hand-held Dirt Devil that fell apart so I should have known better. Lesson learned.Tomorrow I will spend time talking with Dirt Devil customer support, perhaps playing mechanic and electrician. And maybe shop for a box large enough to return it in. Or just send it to a landfill."
3,DIFFICULT HOSE ASSEMBLY,"I knew when I bought this vacuum that it was lightweight plastic, the price was reasonable and I thought that if it lasted at least a couple of years it would be worth it. It was easy to assemble and the pick-up performance has been great. The hose attachment has always been stiff thus hard to maneuver and the plastic end of the hose that fits onto the unit too difficult to remove; it started to give way the first year. At 18 months the end split nearly in two so wouldn't stay on at all. I secured it with duct tape which lasted about a month. It collapsed and 'ate' the end of a chrome wand I use from another vacuum; it's hung up on a fitting on the wand and impossible to get apart. It's completely disabled now for upright use, so I'm purchasing a new hose assembly which costs about half what I paid for the vacuum. We'll see how easily it installs and how long it lasts. Overall performance is good; parts are too flimsy, and the hose could be improved. ML"
3,"Good suction, but...","I got this vacuum at the beginning of July. I have 2 dogs that shed, but neither has long hair or a heavy coat. The vacuum has great suction. It is loud, but not unbearably so. It is cheaply made, but as long as it works, I don't care how it looks.Two weeks ago (so 3 1/2 months of use), the power switch broke. There is another review on here that had that same thing happen. Luckily, it broke in the on position, so I just plug it in to start it, and unplug it to stop it.I use the extension wand and the crevice tool a lot, and the connection where the extension connects to the hose is so loose that I have to hold them together so it doesn't fall apart while in use.I bought a 10 pack of the basic vacuum bags at the same time as the vacuum and change them out every two weeks, which is apparently not often enough as they have burst 3 times while I was vacuuming, blowing dust everywhere.And that's been my experience so far."
2,Power cord shorted out,"This was my third Dirt Devil in four years. The first one worked wonderfully until the power cord shorted out and started a small fire. The second one worked fine, and still does, but keeps loosing its wheels. The third one was bought on June 17 and again had a power cord short. It produced a big spark and scared my wife who was using it at the time. The short always occurs at the point where the cord enters the body of the vacuum cleaner. I think that I am going to buy another one and just put a rubber sleeve around the area to prevent the cable from fraying and twisting."
4,Light and Powerful,I recently bought this vacuum and have been pleasantly surprised by how much dirt it picks up. It is a perfect base vacuum to clean any house. The only down side is that it is a bit noisy.
2,LOUD! Poor pick up job on tile,"I needed an inexpensive vacuum with attachments and tried this. It is EXTREMELY loud, and does not do a good job picking up debris on my tile floors. i feel the ""blowback"" on my feet as I vacuum with any sand/dust etc just redistributed. I have to go over small items like pine needles or crumbs twice to get it to pick up. It does work much better on carpet, and has very good suction. The attachments work well with good pickup. I do not recommend this product, and will use it as my ""upstairs machine"" where I have all carpeting."
2,Don't buy,"Don't buy it unless you can't aford anything more expensive.Not easy to put together, an older woman would not be ableto. Simple parts they could have put on were left to thebuyer. Mine was defective in three areas. A self tapingscrew did not have anything to tap with and I spent 30 min.try to screw this awkard screw in, then I looked at thetapping end and understood why it would not go in.Front of the vacumn would not snap shut, Finally gotit 3/4 shut and was able to use it, the front fell offand I could see all kinds of dust not in the bag butone the inside walls of the mainframe. So back itwent after I got to take it apart to pack it up."
1,Not Too Impressed,"So, I did some research on good functioning yet cost effective vacuum cleaners. Dirt Devil came up as highly rated so I shopped around for the best price. Purchased the vacuum from Amazon.com and, at the time, the price and free shipping was an outstanding value. When I received the appliance, I assembled it and to my surprise.... it was loud and switching from floor vacuuming to the hose nozzle is very awkward. So, to say the least, I'm not too impressed with this model or make."
1,i cant even rate it,"this is the biggest piece of shit i have ever seen, this thing could not pick up a hooker with a 50 dollar bill ,im not sending it back,im throwing it in the street"
1,broken,the wheal was broken and ups came one day and were supposed to come the next to pick it up two and half weeks ago and its still waiting for pick up
3,2011 Pricing,"Amazonis having an upright vacuum sale? Really?? Glad to hear it! Because the vacuum that might possibly interest me has increased in value in just a few short days. It was $39.99 last week! It is now $10.00 more. It earned interestafter Jan 1...right? Of course this the retail game: jack up some prices while lowering others and declare a gigantic sale.It is not without value. It allows the consumer to identify the "" turkeys"" in the inventory.The vacuum I have reference to is Dirt Devil Model MO85590 Upright w/bag.When you decide to price this product realistically let me know. I might consider it."
1,LOUDEST VACUUM! DO NOT BUY ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE KIDS,"This is the loudest vacuum I've ever used. My two children are terrified and cry every time I turn it on. It sounds as if you are mowing your lawn in you living room. It may be cheap, but cheap comes with a price. Your hearing!"
3,Can tell it won't last long,"I bought this vacuum to use in my office at work because I have dust allergies. The promote the fact that it's ""featherlite"" and boy it sure is. It works fine now but I can tell it won't last long. Luckily my office is small and it will only get used once or twice a week. But I wanted a cheap bagged vacuum and I got it."
1,Avoid at all cost!,"It doesn't work at all, even when it was new. Buy a crate of beer for $40 and you will save yourself the frustration."
1,"designed ""with customer in mind""","I started reading the instruction manual. Wires in this vacuum cleaner have cheap dangerous chemicals (including lead). Why put your health in risk trying to save a few bucks?Designed with ""customer in mind"" indeed.I am going to find another vacuum cleaner, thank you."
3,Dirt Devil Vaccum,Vaccum arrived as scheduled and had to put it together. Works for what i need but is not good for older carpets. States that it is self adjustable but not much adjusting. Will serve it purposed fopr now. Better description needed.
4,Don't call the customer help line,"When I got this vacuum cleaner, the on/off switch would stick in the on postion I called the company and was told to return it. That the switch was faulity. On closer excaming it the swicth had a piece of packing cardboard in it. I removed it and the machine ran alright, noisesy but it ran. The answer to all the problems that the machine has is send it back to the seller."
1,You get what you pay for,"This thing is a piece of crap. It can't handle cleaning a small apartment. It sucks up junk, and then just shoots it out again. There is a strong stream of air that shoot out the front that disperses dirt all over the room as you try to vacuum. It's an absolute waste of money...I would be better off cleaning all the floor with my hand held vac."
2,Sucktacular!,"We purchased this in August of 2008. It still turns on and makes sucking noises but no suction occurs. I have cleared the hoses and to no avail, the unit still does not work.We bought it thinking how bad can it be? It stinks. Plastic pieces keep falling off. The hose connection to the main floor unit has cracked and now, no amount of duct tape can fix it.If you only need a vacuum to work for a year, this one will fit the bill."
3,NOT 'featherlight',"This vacuum works extremely well, even on carpets with stubborn pet hairs,and the bag is easier to change than some other models I've used. However, it is still a very heavy machine, especially to use on stairs. The electric cord is attached almost at floor level which of course means you either have to hold it up out of the way while vacuuming, or keep wrapped somewhat around the prongs, to avoid sucking it up. It is nice to have the tools parked on it so you have them handy from room to room.Dirt Devil M085590RED Featherlite Bagged Upright Vacuum Cleaner"
3,Not a bad starter vacuum,"This is the first vacuum I have ever purchased and although it's not the best, it does a fair job for the price paid. I'm a single person and don't make a huge mess in the house so it's suits my purpose. If you have a family and need a heavy duty vacuum, this is definitely not the one for you!"
5,Excellent vacuum for the price,"I purchased this vacuum for an elderly relative based on the weight and the price. It's your basic vacuum, and works better than my ancient Hoover. It is pretty much all-plastic, but it seems durable enough for everyday use. Very powerful and easy to move. Cord is a decent length and has on-board cleaning tools that work well. The only flaw I would find is the part where the hose can be disconnected doesn't seem real strong, so you have to be gentle when removing. Even if it only lasts a year or two, the price cannot be beat."
1,Was that a plane that just flew into the house?,"This thing is soooo loud, it sounds like a jet just flew into the house. And the cord is super short, and it doesn't even vacuum well - I had to go over the same spot several times. I sent it back and got a Hoover. Much happier."
1,Dirt Pusher,I am shocked at the overall great reviews...just got this item two days ago and is now having to buy another vacuum cleaner....the Dirt Devil simply pushes the dirt around and picks NOTHING up....WARNING: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
1,Throwing it in the trash,This worked ok for the price for about a week- now it makes an awful loud noise and barely picks up any dirt. I owned one of these models about 8 yrs ago and couldn't have been more pleased- not sure what happened to their product now- but it's worthless.
1,not worth it!,"I purchased this vacuum because our other dirt devil worked well, and was no longer being made. This product is worthless. This vacuum has terrible suction. You have to go over the floor repeatedly and still there are things it leaves behind. I would not waste money on this product."
3,Kinda Loud,"This is a replacement vacuum from one of those bagless ones which I will never buy again.The problem I think with most vacuums is not enough suction. The Dirt Devil sucks up better thanthe Hoover bagless but still not as good as I think it should. Understandably too strong suction will lift up rugs. But better suction is preferred for hardwood floors that tend to collect dust balls in hard to get corners. Hence I use a shop vac as back up. The Dirt Devil was much noisier than I expected.But like what another reviewer said, for the price you can retire it in 2 - 3 yrs and not feel likeyou overpaid for it. My advice is if you buy it get it with 2 orders of the bags so you wont run out.Thank goodness my gross emptying bagless vacuum days are over! And the Hoover? That lemon's gone to vacuum hell!"
1,"cheap, breakable",This vacuum is not worth the money you pay for it. The plastic hose connector on ours broke and costs $25 to replace. The screws holding parts to the neck of the machine soon stripped out. We're junking it! We got what we paid for.
2,Below Average Vacuum Cleaner,I got this vacuum cleaner about a week ago andit is one of the best vacuum's I've ever had.It was not that difficult to put togetherbut you do need a screwdriver and you haveto look for the 4-6 screws that come with it.All in all a good name brand vacuum fro ma good companyat a great price that works well and does a good job vacuumingmy carpet.Update: This vacuum cleaner broke after a monthof using it. It was easy to assemble but workslike crap and my older vacuum cleaner workedbetter then this. The parts are cheaply madeand the model is of poor construction.It makes a loud noise and is hard to pushand even operate at times.I change my rating from 4 stars to 2 starsfor this product.
3,Very Powerful But Just Kicks Around Kitty Litter,"The price on this vacuum is very cheap and it's really powerful. We bought this because we have a small apartment with harwood/carpets and two cats. Every weekend we need to vacuum to get the kitty litter the cats spread around.The rotating brush just kicks it all around even on the carpet while picking up maybe half of the dirt. I usually end up sweeping, detaching the hose and sucking up the dirt. Then I go back and run the brush over everything. Far too much work.Obviously this isn't the vacuum for me. I think if we had thick carpet it would be fine but the ""self-adjusting height adjustment"" feature is a joke. It sits far too high to work on bare floors or light carpets and shoots any sort of dirt at your feet and shins."
1,Terrible customer service,"You will need to put this vacuum cleaner together. That was not much of a problem. One of the parts; the ""tool caddy"" came partially assembled incorrectly. I called the company, Dirt Devil. They were not really very helpful. This was probably a $1 plastic part they could just send out to you, instead they offer to have you take the entire vacuum into a ""repair center"" to have them look at it (""if it is under warranty"" ?WHAT? I just got it!). I guess they will help you if you want to waste half a day and a lot of gas$$ instead of sending you a $1 part."
4,NOISY BUT HANDY!!,Well.. I bought it for 45$... and comparatively its cheaper than any other vacuum cleaner... But only one problem with this model is you need to change dirt bag after few weeks.. And U need to purchase those bags separately.. Also the major drawback is it makes HELL LOT OF NOISE!! So much than if u start it during night.. your neighbor will dial 911 without a second thought.. :P Apart from that its good.. You can clean small corners as well as 1500sq. ft floor (carpet).. In all good deal if noise is not a problem for you..
4,Pretty good,"This was pretty affordable . Works great ,a little heavy but it does the job . Would buy it again"
3,Good for the price,The product comes unassembled but it is easily assembled. It is good for the price. My only complaint is that on berber type carpet it cleans well and fluffs nicely but on more plush carpet it tends to leave five lines everywhere where the beater bars vacuum. I only have two rooms with carpet and won't return it but if my whole home were carpeted with plush carpet it just would not work for me. You truly get what you pay for.
4,"For the price, you can't go wrong.",Lucky for me I live in a nice one bedroom apartment. For the size of my housing this vacum proves the perfect size and power. Not as light as I would had liked but easy to manage. The length of the power cord is a very welcome addition as is the light. As far as being a vacum needing bags I find that not a problem what so ever. I prefer a bag vacum. The bagless type which I owned previously always seem to let too much dust into the air. No such problem with the bag. I understand there are two types of bag for this machine. Spend a little more to get the dust free type. The light on the front is just an extra. The set up of the machine was okay but took longer than I thought necessary.For power it is great for the size of my area. I can't see it lasting too long if you own a full two story home. For the price though you could get a unit for each floor.So far I like very much.
3,Cheap,"Pros: Cheap, Light weightCons: Not powerfulIf this is your first purchase and you don't want to invest in more money then try this out.I f I were given a second chance then I would rather go to Kenmore or some other good brands. I simply forgot while purchasing this vacuum cleaner that this is only one time purchase for 1 - 2 years.Conclusion: Invest in a good vacuum cleaner"
4,"Random glitch made me return it; otherwise, solid product and I'm ordering another one","I purchased this vacuum and ended up having to return it because the pedal that turned the vacuum on and off didn't work properly. So for a day or so I was turning it on and off by plugging it in and out, respectively (which invariably couldn't last long; hence why I returned it). Aside from that, it seemed to work marvelously - really sucked everything up. Kudos to Amazon for a flawless, painless return. I'm going to purchase the product again because I assume the pedal thing was just a random incident; otherwise, I really liked the product and would have liked to keep it."
2,Useless on hard floors,"We had been looking for a lightweight upright vacuum and decided to give this one a try. We have an old model Dirt Devil that dates back to the early '90s that's still going strong so we felt good about buying another Dirt Devil.My husband and I have been sorely disappointed with this model though. It is indeed lightweight, which is a plus since we have to tote it up and down the narrow steps of our home. And there is onboard tool storage, but that's about the only good things I can say.The machine is extremely loud. It is useless on hard floors. It just flings the dirt in all directions since there's no way to disengage the beater bar. The hose is difficult to detach and re-engage.True, the machine was inexpensive and we got what we paid for. I would not recommend this machine except for maybe someone with a small carpeted apartment."
3,"SUCKS, but in a good way.","Powerful vacuum for the price. However, the plastic bits on the outside (like the hooks for holding up the cord) are pretty low quality. One of the hooks cracked and broke within the first month of use on my vacuum. One of the plastic attachments also cracked. If it were not for the lousy construction of the outside bits, I'd give the vacuum an 5 stars. Sucks up EVERYTHING."
4,Noisy but effective vacuum cleaner,"When we were shopping for a vacuum cleaner, I was looking for something lightweight with a small head to get into smaller spaces than our other cleaner. This Dirt Devil is lighter than most vacuum clearners (but, in my opinion, not ""Featherlite""), has a smaller head to get into tighter spaces, and definitely, would probably ""suck the fillings out of your teeth."" Such power! Picks up everything, even our cockatiel's small feathers; our other vacuum cleaner would just roll over and ignore them. A wonderful cleaner for the price. It performs its duties easily and powerfully. I will accept the noise from the cleaner because it doesn't take a lot of time to do its job. A GREAT buy!"
4,very good deal!,"very affordable, very light, picks up dirt and hair very well. the only thing I don't like is that it's quite loud but still I am very happy with this purchase!"
3,Does the job,Works good. Basic vacuum cleaner. A little loud and the wheels could be made sturdier. With past vacuums (the same model) the wheels are the first thing to break.
1,Disappointed,This light weight vac has good power but I cannot use it on my rugs. It leaves lines in the rug that do not disappear. Very disappointing.
2,Pretty Cheap,"Once it came in and I put it together, I took it apart and returned it. Very cheap looking and just not what I was expecting. Went to Walmart and got Bissell PowerForce and LOVE it."
5,Great CHEAP vacuum,"If you don't have alot of money but need a vacuum, choose this one. I bought it for my father to use to vacuum the carpet in his trailer and it works perfect and has alot of suction. It is a great little vacuum. Please be aware that this is a small vacuum and in turn uses small bags. If you are doing alot of vacuuming it would probably be good to check the bag often. I would buy the 10 pack bags on Amazon because it is a better deal than getting them at Walmart. For $40 - you can't go wrong with this one."
1,Never again.,"We purchased this as a backup vacuum when our Hoover Wind Tunnel decided to balk during our daily house cleaning one afternoon.I must admit: it was a sporadic decision; made in a panic.""Amazon is easy"", I said. ""Dirt Devil--has decent ratings, and it's just going to be a backup"". So I thought.9 months later, we have burn hole in the carpet where Dirt Devil put her last mark.Yes, it has a powerful suction. The vacuum tracks were beautiful while they lasted. The hose (used for cleaning attachments) began to consistently dislocate and eventually cracked a few months after purchase. What did I expect? It's cheap.However, I'm used to decent customer service. The product dies; it gets fixed--or replaced.Amazon's policy is 30 day warranty. Dirt Devil (1 year warranty) wanted me to bring the vacuum 1 hour away to be examined and fixed or replaced at their discretion.For a ~$50 vacuum, it's just not worth it."
1,poorly made,"I bought this because I dislike bagless vacuums. Who wants to breath all of the dirt each time you empty it. This, however is a plastic piece of junk. The hose attaches to the motor with a twist and notch latch. Good luck with that one. The hose developed a crack and now will not stay attached. I even tried duct tape and it won't hold. I guess you get what you pay for and this one is not worth the money. Yes, it sucks big time!!!"
4,Works great,This thing has old school power. More suction and better ceaning then any bagless I ever had. Only 4 stars cause the hardware plastic parts are super cheap and won't last very long but the important parts are fine. I love this unit. Not too heavy a little noisy but well worth it.
4,"Great vacuum, all promised info true",I am very happy with this item and delivery too. It is feather light and much more powerful than expected.
4,So far so good,"I've used this vaccum twice on brand new carpet, automatic height adjuster works well, and vaccum is very light. No problems to report :-)"
1,A Piece of Crap,"When I first got it didnt know hose goes over in hole on base but was it wasnt long before figuring this out with everything flying everywhere after attaching it still didnt do any better this thing wouldnt pick up anything hardly if I didnt go over 3 or 4 times, oh and the bag holds nothing hardly. I live a one bedroom apt by myself and I dont have to vaccum but every two weeks which nothing really is on the carpet. This thing is awful."
2,Not a set!,"Someone reviewed this stating it was a set. It is not, the price is for a single dish. I was disappointed to pay so much for one dish, and it is pretty fragile. I broke it soon after it arrived. Pretty dish for making single serve baked eggs, but too expensive and fragile to me."
5,Real science presented in easy words and great illustrations,"What happens to a star when it dies? A small child dons a spacesuit to find out. The gravity of the black hole stretches him out. Another child considers a thimbleful of black hole on a seesaw, outweighing a stack of elephants.This book is full of hard science. But it is presented in easy words that a child of 4-8 can understand. The bright illustrations are full of motion and lend understanding and excitement to the subject."
4,BLUE COLPAC,"The item was delivered as expected. The price was competitive with local vendors even while waiting for it to arrive.Overall, I'm satisfied with my experience with Amazon.com as I have been in the past with items I've purchased."
5,Use this every day!!!,I live my ice pack. Stays cold for an hour and large enough to cover almost entire back. Stats pliable even when coming out of the freezer.
2,Not The Same...,"Not the same anymore. I've used this brand of cold pack for many years, but these are noticeably different. The plastic cover is much thinner and softer; hence will tear easier. The gel (when thawed) is very much oozier, making it difficult to get in the freezer in a flat position. It wants to run to one end or ends up all lumpy. AND the main issue is these do not stay cold nearly as long as my previous versions. I will probably not purchase again and will look for some other brand that is more like these used to be. One other note, why doesn't the manufacturer include a fitted, washable fabric cover for these? I'm tired of trying to wrap these in towels or something else when using. I'd gladly pay a couple of dollars more for this and it would help to protect the plastic from tearing, as well. Anyone agree?"
2,Needs a specific storage temp to be effective,"The description with the package says this should be stored at 12 degrees, but I did not see this listed on Amazon. Well, I don't have a freezer specific for ice packs, so I put it in my freezer at 2 degrees. It is unusable when stored at this temp as it does not conform to the area needing ice and is ""frozen solid.""I have seen these used in physical therapy offices and they are great, but they are also stored at the recommended temp, which as a consumer, I cannot do. Of course, you could let them defrost for a short time and then use.I use them after I play tennis, and don't want to wait 30 minutes to apply, so out of luck.I would look elsewhere unless you can store at 12 degrees. Most fridges are kept between 36 and 42 degrees and freezers are between 0 and 3 degrees."
3,Have Bought These For Years- BUT,I recently bought another one of these and two black ones prior to my surgery. I love the size but it does not stay as cold as long as the black ones does.Cheryl
4,coldpac,I like these cold pacs. I have been using them for an inflammed knee and they conform nicely to the shape of the knee. They are versatile and can conform to other joints as well. They stay really cold for about 10 mins and cold enough for 10 more mins then can be put back in the freezer. I have been using mine every day for a few months and they seem durable as well.
4,Just what it says!,"It stays cold and works as described. The only drawback is it is bulky and does not form around knee well. Otherwise, it is great."
4,The best cold pack I've found so far,"The 11x21 is large enough to drape a corner over my shoulder and cover my trapezius down to mid-back. These are for the most part highly durable cold packs (I have four of different sizes) and the hold their temperature for about 45 minutes, which is double the time recommended.I have had to replace one for breakage at the seam - for this, I give these four stars instead of five. Never was sure how this happened as I never mistreated these things and they only go from the freezer to where I lay on them. At least the gel cleaned up very easily and did not stain, unlike the blue gel packs which can stain finished wood."
5,great product,Product stays cold a long time and yet you can mold and move it because its not hardened like ice. Just needs a cover or towel so its not directly on your skin.
2,Don't get or stay that cold,"I have back trouble and lost the ice packs I got from my chiropractor. I tried to substitute these, but even when left overnight in the freezer, they did not get or stay that cold. They were not useless, but I would look for a better product."
2,"Poor quality, tore at seams after only a few months.",I was very happy with this product until the seams started to break and the gel inside began to ooze out. As other users have stated I also tried to patch the seams but it was useless. I wound up having to pitch it.
1,seam ripped,I bought 2 of these and the seam ripped on both after a while. They have to make a better product.
3,"Feels good, weighs a lot","I bought this item after having it used on me in my physical therapy. It does what it is supposed to very well--provide cold sensation to inflamed areas. But good heavens' it is heavy! If you don't need one to cover as much area as this one, consider buying one a bit smaller. I am going to get a smaller one and retire this one, as it takes up a lot of room in the freezer and is pretty heavy when placed on my hip. I do very much like the blue plastic one--it seems very durable and I'm glad I bought it rather than the cheaper black one. The price here on Amazon is so much more reasonable than trying to get one of these in a medical supply shop, believe me. I am glad I bought it however, and I think others will be as well, as it provides wonderfu cooling relief to in flamed areas without freezing them."
4,Great Product... Until It Failed at the Seams.,"I bought this pack about 1 year ago. Functionally, it is perfect. The vinyl feels nice and sturdy and it stays cold for much longer than the CVS brand over-sized units I have. However, after about 6 months of medium use (3-5 times per week) the pack failed at its seams. I want to believe it was a defect, but who knows? My 3 CVS packs are all 3-4 years old with no such problems. I am going to purchase another soon because the ice pack works so well. Hopefully #2 will last me a bit longer. 3.5-4 stars."
2,The seam tore too easily,"I got the Cold Pack based on all the nice reviews on this site, and the first one I got was an extra large size for my back. It really did keep the cold for a long time and was very comfortable against the back. However, the cold Pack started to leak after one month. I was surprised since no one else complained about this problem, and thought maybe I was unlucky. I got a second one with a regular size this time, but again, the pack's seam tore after less than a month. I am giving up on this kind of Cold Pack however nice it feels. I don't want to waste my money on something that only lasts one month or so."
5,Great product- worst packaging possible,Im a Dr. of Physical Therapy. I often provide cold packs for my homebound patients. I use these cold packs for a living- great product. My only gripe is the terrible packaging! It is nearly impossible to damage gel packs but the packaging can be crushed. I received 2 cervical gel packs in such poor condition that I cant show these to patients. Boxes split wide open! Ill be finding another vendor.
3,Seams always tear after a year or two,"I have been using these col-pacs successfully for swollen knees and ankles. But they just wear out eventually and a seam will open up and a gooey, grey paste will emanate from the hole. If you handle these with kid gloves, do not fold them when putting them in the freezer, never drop them, and treat them like eggshells this probably won't happen. But in everyday use they are bound to fall off the bed or slip out of your hand.I have a narrow, side by side freezer and have to fold the large size col-pac to put it back in the freezer.Don't get me wrong- they work great, and conform well to the aching joint that needs to be iced. Just do not expect them to last a really long time if you use them on a fairly regular basis. I have been using them for years and they always ""fail"" (rip open) after a couple of years."
5,recommended by our physical therapist,"Great product. stays cold for about 20 min - which is really all you need when icing. It can be bent and ""molded"" to your specific area of need. You can feel the cold through running pants, but we also place it on bare skin without any issues."
4,I little undersized,"I have several other Colpac ice packs, which are the best brand that I have tried. This one is listed at 5.5"" x 7.5"", but the actual ice pack part of it is only 5.25"" x 6.5"". The larger ones stay cold longer (as you would expect)."
5,Excellent Colpac,A friend recommended this because of my back pain. I bought it and didn't doble check the size but I find it very useful. I just lay face down in my bed and place it on my back. Covers my whole back. It has helped tremendously with my back pain.
2,Only good for 3 minutes!,"I have the 5.5"" x 7.5"" pack and it only stays cold for about 3 minutes so it's pretty useless. Maybe the bigger sizes maintain their coldness longer. I think an ice pack such as theEnglish Ice Cap 9"" Diameterwould work much much better, and you don't have to wait for it to get cold if you have ice on hand."
2,didn't last long,Was great while it lasted but after only 3 months the seam opened and stuff oozed out. The cheaper drugstore ones I have lasted for years! I wouldn't buy it again.
3,if only the Colpac Cold pack didnt leak,"I was very happy with these ice packs, I have several of different sizes, however the two 7.5x11 ones which I use fairly regularly both sprung leaks along the seams within 6 months. I could not recommend these to anyone who relies on ice packs to treat neck or back pain and uses them frequently. I have contacted the seller to find out if mine are still under warranty. As ice packs they perform wonderfully but once the goup surprises you, you wont be very happy. This is a real pity as I purchased them based on the fantastic reviews I saw on Amazon and had high hopes for a long life for them.UPDATE: The manufacturers replaced the two leaking ice packs under warranty terms. All I had to do was send them my Amazon invoice. I have changed my review to 3 stars based on this. The other ice packs continue to work as promised."
2,Worked until it dried out,"I purchased the long neck shaped product in 2007. It worked well for several years, both in the freezer as a cold pack, and in the microwave as a heat pack.However, due to limited space, I did not store it in the freezer. Instead I kept it in the cabinet just above the refrigerator. I recently needed to use it, and I discovered that the gel inside the pack had diminished in volume and became quite stiff. It is now unusable.It had never leaked, and there was no evidence of gel leakage around the pack where I had stored it. My only conclusion is that the solvent used in the gel had evaporated through the plastic, leaving behind a stiff, crumbly substance. This may have been due to the increased heat above the refrigerator, accelerating the evaporative process.For the price of this product, I will not buy it again. I would recommend purchasing one of the cheaper versions."
1,- Eye - Shaped to Cover Both Eyes Total Waste of Money,"Cold Pack - ColPaC Brand - Blue Vinyl - Eye - Shaped to Cover Both EyesThe only positive thing I can say is that it did get cold after sitting overnight in the freezer. But so would a pair of spoons, and you'd be much better off. The filling of this pack is hard & chunky -- think peanut brittle. It certainly doesn't conform in any way to your eyes =the pieces are too big.Don't waste your money! You'd be much better off with frozen spoons, a bag of frozen corn or peas, or another eye mask from the drugstore."
2,Leaked in less than 1 yr/20 uses,"I had to revise this review due to the darn thing starting to leak the semi frozen gel inside it...it sat in my freezer most of the time, used max 1 x per week... in last use this past week, it was clearly leaking! Had to be tossed outThis is WELL BELOW my expectations for light use of the product. Be careful; I will look for another one with stronger edge seals."
4,mixed feelings on this item,"Love the way it forms to my elbow area. Love the fact that I can take it right from the freezer and put it directly on my inflamed area without any sort of barrier in between it and me. What I don't like is the fact that the coldness doesn't seem to last more than 10-15 minutes. I mean, to do a good job, even doctors say to put ice on the inflamed area for 20-30 minutes. I also found that to get a real good contact with it I had to use a medical wrap wound fairly tight so the Pack would keep a constant firm preasure on my sore spot.I like this item, just wish the cold lasted a little longer."
5,Real Easy To Use,"I have been using this product for an year now and it was the best buy I ever made. The wax is soft and easy to use and spreads smooth. The broad head makes it great for legs and arms. It heats up fast and for clean up just chuck it in the trash. I prefer this cartridge to the narrow head but thats my personal opinion. In all, a great buy!!"
4,this is a classic album!,"not santana's best album, but a very satisfying one. contains their megahits, ""waiting"" and ""evil ways,"" two awesome songs. ""persuasion"" is pretty good too.if you want to be blown away, get ""lotus,"" santana's japan concert recorded live in 1973. it is an epic masterpiece of nightmarish proportions! i kid you not when i say that you haven't heard santana until you've heard ""lotus."""
4,Very nice...,"Santana's debut album is full of fiery hot guitar licks, groovin' bass lines, and highly danceable percussion solos. I happen to prefer Santana 3 and Abraxas to this, but there are still many good songs on here. The best one is clearly the live version of Soul Sacrifice, recorded at no other concert than Woodstock. I really can't describe it, sorry. It is 11 minutes but amazing. And it has an extended drum solo that never gets on my nerves, which is a pretty nice achievement in itself."
3,Woodstock extras,"The bonus tracks are an excellent addition to the never ending stream of unreleased Woodstock recordings. The sound is brilliant - especially on ""Savor"" where the silence is almost palpable. ""Fried Neckbones"" comes as a surprise to those who thought that ""Soul Sacrifice"" was the final number performed at the festival. (How could anyone top ""Sacrifice?"" The answer is that even Santana themselves couldn't. Neckbones is almost lethargic in comparison.) The unedited version of ""Soul Sacrifice was released on the Woodstock box set in 1994 but the mix here is much much better. The stereo definition is spot on."
4,Solid Debut,"This debut is first rate all the way. Carlos Santana provides some super guitar solos with a cutting edge latin flare. Often overlooked are Greg Rollie's piano, organ, and vocal contributions. His singing on Persuasion, Shades of Time, and You Just Don't Care are very strong. I simply adore the keyboard touches on Treat. That instrumental is a super underatted gem.I can't overlooked the percussion and drumming either. Its these compelling rhythms that separate Santana from many of the jam bands of the late sixties.Anyway, this is a fine debut which almost rates on the same level as Abraxas and Santana 3."
4,Debut,"This is my favorite Santana album. Being their first, it is not as diverse or exploratory as others, but its consistency is solid. I am a huge fan of blues music, and this album is Santana's most outwardly bluesy album. ""Persuasion"" and ""Treat"" are wonderful. And the Woodstock cut of ""Soul Sacrifice"" was absolutely one of the most intense renditions of any song at that concert. And Jimi Hendrix was there. Now, to even come close to Hendrix, one must whip-a**, and ""Soul Sac"" does just that. Check the drum solo. Whoa. ""Fried Neckbones"" also teems with bubbling intensity. And for you Top 40 pop rocker dudes, ""Evil Ways"" should keep your unadventursome ears off of the radio for a while. Along with ""The Doors,"" ""Are You Experienced,"" and ""Led Zeppelin 1,"" this album is one of the finest debuts of the 60s."
5,Changing Rock Music Forever,"In 1969 lots of things were being changed in rock music, you had Black Sabbath that were about to explode on the scene in 1970 that defined heavy metal and you also had Santana who combined latin music with rock and came up with something special, and there first album proves it. An essential album for anyone to own who calls themselves a music lover, an amazing album."
5,Good introduction to Shakespeare's classic tragedy/romance,"""Romeo And Juliet""by William Shakespeareadapted by Bruce Covilleillustrated by Dennis Nolan(Dial Press, 1999)----------------------------------------This is a good, compact adaptation of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, ""Romeo And Juliet,"" with crisp, cogent prose that includes some passages of original dialogue and an easy to follow narrative thread. Coville doesn't cut corners when it comes to the dark side of the story -- he doesn't linger on the more morbid dialogue, but makes it clear when someone is murdered or poisoned, etc. When seen in such a condensed form, the story is rather dark; the romantic allure of the two teens gets a little lost in the bustle, but this is still a fine adaptation, as are Coville's other works. (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain book reviews)"
4,Great Except for Excessive Battery Consumption,"This mirror is great except that it runs through batteries extremely quickly. I use it for about 20 to 30 minutes a week, and the batteries run out every 2 to 3 weeks, which is extremely fast. Other than this drawback, the mirror is great. The magnification is great and the placement of the light at the bottom of the mirror works well."
2,not so great as a travel mirror,"This mirror is bulky to travel with. The mirror itself is okay, but is not very compact and does not come with any kind of travel pouch. Therefore, I do not think it should be included as a ""travel Mirror""."
1,Needed replaced within 6 months,"When I built my computer, I purchased a slightly earlier version of this drive (48X) and a DVD drive from BUSlink. Both proved to be horrible purchases. There is very little problem installing the drive (as normal) and it worked great in the begining, but after 6 months the CD-RW drive completely refused to burn anything and started making grinding noises when trying to burn. Then the DVD drive started failing a month after that. I recommend drives from Samsung, they seem to last much longer from other computers I built."
1,Please be advised don't order it !!!,"I ordered this item on Jan. 14, 2004. I have not received it until Mar. 3, 2004. I am so upset!"
1,Dead in 4 months,"This drive died in 4 months of normal use. It was easy to setup and worked fine for those 4 months but one fine morning, it just died for no apparent reason. My 80 GB worth of data was lost and could not be recovered. I wanted to get my data back so had to open the casing ( i know it would not qualify for warranty, but my data was more important than the price I paid for the drive). Then hooked up the hard disk to my desktop but still couldn't access my data, it is basically dead. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DRIVE TO ANYONE. 1 thing I learnt from this experience is that Whatever drive you are using always remember to periodically backup the data."
5,Great Add ON/Back UP Drive,Just added this drive to my desktop and it works just fine. I am not sure about the software because I have no need for it. But the drive works great. I have all my songs on it.
1,horrible,"my hard drive broke within a month...it was clearly defective hardware. if you want to end up with a 'recertified' drive as a replacement (aka USED drive) after paying full price for a new...feel free to choose western digital.also, expect your recertified drive to look like it was dragged along the street by a bus."
5,No complaints here so far,"I also have one 80GB external hard drive by Western Digital, and both have served me well. Most of the use they get is for storing my music in lossless formats (takes up over 100GB). I was a bit worried that the hard drive may not be able to stream at bit rates like 1 megabit per second, but I can even copy files onto the hard drive while playing the music without issue. Video also plays just fine."
4,A great value,"This is actually the second one I purchased - I run two PCs and don't want to connect/disconnect the drive if I can help it. The best features are the multiple connection options that make it easy to use the drive with any PC or Mac. It powers down after some period of disuse, unlike so many other external drives, and come right back when you access it. The front-mounted on/off switch is a big help and the included Retrospect backup software runs nicely and fast. I do prefer to call up the Retrospect software and control backups from there rather than use the preset buttons on the unit, but they actually work fine. The built-in USB port is very handy as well and the unit doesn't have to be running to use it."
5,decent price,"looks good, works well but the draw back is the cables which are very delicate and i ended up buying a usb cord which god damaged when i was fixing it."
4,wd external hard drive,"Great hard drive. only complaint is that it has a pretty big footprint. Runs quiet smooth and fast, also gives you an extra usb port. Excellent price for this hard drive as it gives you both firewire or usb option."
4,Very good but...,"Generally very good, but the power cord only attaches loosely, so you really have to be careful with the device."
5,Great Product for a extra hard drive or laptop,I use this Hard drive for my laptop so I could store more stuff. I give this product an A+++ I recommend you to have this hard drive if you need more space and its speed is very well.
1,No Vista drivers,Doesn't work with Vista. No help from WD Support when they finally replied to my email.
2,2 week drive!,"My drive worked for only 2 weeks. After coming back from a friends house, where I copied a lot of movies from him, I turned it on and I just heard a very aggressive noise and it ""crashed"" no signal anymore. Lost all my data... tons of my MP3s. Just giving it a 2 because I liked it and the two weeks I used.. have the USB port is nice.. maybe I was just not lucky with my unit.. but I won't risk again.. I will by another brand next time."
5,Safety Net!,"I love that I don't have to worry about backing up my data anymore. This system works very well. There was a little bit of a learning curve for me, although I eventually figured it out. Any file over 4GB (video programs, etc) won't transfer so you have to change your settings. But once I figured that out, it has been great."
3,Does the job,Overall performance has been fine. It does run a bit 'hard' which worries me that someday it will die and I'll lose everything. To avoid that scenario I usually try not to run the device unless I'm truly backing up things from my main drive.
4,It is what it is,"I've had this drive for a while and have had no problems storing or retrieving data. It's shortcomings are not deal breakers. For instance, it is not usb powered, so it must be plugged in seperately. You must turn the drive off before unplugging. also, the power chord and USB chord are not very secure in the unit; they fall out easily if you are not careful."
5,recommended,"I'm backing up a G3 ibook as I type. It has backed up 20gb in 2 hours. This drive is simple to use with a ""one touch"" back up system, and it comes with all the necessary cables for firewire and/or usb 2.0. It's a bargain."
2,"poor customer service, buttons don't work, incompatible with vista",I have owned the dual-option combo drive for about a year. The buttons to back up have never worked. I see that WD is aware of this problem. I just bought a new computer only to learn that the combo drive is not compatible with Vista. I've contacted WD and they have offerred only useless automated replies. Phone support is only availble for $15!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT for 3 reasons:1. Bad customer service (no phone)2. Buttons don't work (unless you download a fix)3. Incompatible with Vista
1,Hard drive crashes,"I've had this WD 250 GB HD for about three months now and it has been nothing but trouble. Twice now the unit has ""magically"" erased itself with nothing left to recover. The backup feature is nothing more than making a copy of your documents to another hard drive. I would only suggest such a unit if you have sufficient space on another, reliable hard drive, or can make hard copies of you documents to a recordable disk."
1,WD doesn't support Vista and doesn't care ~,"I've tried twice via email to get support from WD and as usual, they're putting the blame on Microsoft rather than providing a fix. Vista doesn't recognize the drive. Yep, time to switch brands!"
4,pretty decent Western Digital 250GB external HD,I've had it for about 2 months. It's great to have the USB and Firewire for speed and versitility. It's pretty fast but it does make a slight humming noise.
1,Dont buy this HD,"It worked for about 10 minutes, then it crashed! I tried it on another computer thinking that it was my usb port, but still didnt work. I couldnt believe it crashed so fast. I didnt even lost anydata because it didnt give me time to transfer anything. This all I can say about this HD."
5,Thanks!!!,"I have yet to set this up, but I was very happy with the shipping and I'm sure the drive will be great, thanks!!!"
2,worst experience I had.,"The qulity is low.First one gave up within 2 weeks. The replacement even worse, does not work at all.I have to return two of them."
4,"Solid, quiet, and cool","I've had this since September, and I have not had any complaints. It is well-made -- I'm not afraid of it taking a fall or two. However, this means it is not the best travel-mate. This hard drive is meant to stay put. It's quiet, and it has not produced much heat. I've left this on overnight as well, and it was only luke-warm to the touch. The USB slot in the front is also a nice addition.I give this 4/5 because it is not the fastest drive. However, I have not been inconvenienced by the speed."
2,Software not as good as others say it is.,"I have had some problems setting up the auto back-up and the WD Button Manager. The automatic backup only backs up one drive, so if you have multiple drives, you must back up the 2nd drive manually. My system is a lot slower since the install. I have had to use task manager to kill the Button Manager because my PC was stuck. It turned out it was using 100% of my CPU resources and not letting anything else run."
5,Super value for an external backup drive,"It's quiet, semi-stylish (""boxlike"") and above all it was ultra-cheap on special ($99)."
2,Be aware that,"when I tried to call the response is, the number you have dialed is disconnected and not in service. I wondered why they were marked down now I know. Works ok, but you had better not want any service."
4,A breath of fresh air.,"Mrs. Pollifax always entertains and this installment is very enjoyable. Mrs. Pollifax is commisioned to deliver passports to the underground in Bulgaria and in her usual manner, Mrs. Pollifax makes new friends, this time a couple of young people visiting Europe and members of the underground, and sends Carstairs into fits with her solutions to unexpected problems. Even though this series was written in the early 70s and the political climate has changed, the characters still hold strong today.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good spy story with a bit of good old commonsense thrown in for good measure. Mrs. Pollifax is a breath of fresh air in a slightly smoggy world."
5,A time enjoying Mrs Pollifax's adventures,"I love the Mrs Pollifax books, in today's world, it adds excitement and a feeling that you have joined Mrs Pollifax in her travels"
4,One of the best in the series,"I go back a couple of books in the series now to this one, the third. Fortunately there are no significant references to prior books this time around.Anyhow, this time Mrs. Pollifax finds her way to Bulgaria. Supposedly she is only taking passports to the underground there, but her boss Carstairs is strongarmed into having her taking other items, sewn into her coat, along with her without her knowing it. Complications, unsurprisingly, ensue. She falls in with a group of travelling college students (and one in particular), and leaps in to help when one of them is held by the secret police.She leads both friends and foes on a merry chase as she travels around Bulgaria. It's got to be one of the more complex plots of any of the books I've read so far, and as a result one of the most gripping.Rosenblat again does a superb job with the voices."
1,Didn't taste as good as other Hamburger Helpers,I didn't care for this flavor of Hamburger Helper. Must of been the way they tried to imitate the 'Italian' flavor. It just had a weird flavor about it. I wouldn't buy this kind again
2,Environmentally Sustainable Development,"Defines the world banks medium and long term agenda for improving its assistance to sub Saharan countries on their road toward environmentally sustainable development. Discusses reversal of downward spiral of environmental degradation which is a key element of a strategy to reduce poverty in the region, by maintaining natural capital and using it to sustainably by promoting sound environmental management."
1,Joyce Brothers? James Joyce?,"First of all, Jessica Simpson can sing. More or less. But who cares, when the music she makes is so squeaky clean that the industrial solvent they used to clean it causes instant and intense waves of nausea.Also, what's with the title? Re-Joyce? Joyce? Is there a joyce in the christmas myth? Or is her mom named joyce? What's this business with ""joyce""? I guess they thought they'd try and make it stand out by dividing up one word into two. This could have been clever if the either of the words added some extra meaning, but in this case it's completely extraneous and cloying for attention.Don't reward this kind of idiocy, and don't reward a music industry that tries to force this lowest-common-denominator garbage down our throats. Go buy Nat King Cole or Ray Charles or Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra or anything that will stand the test of time. I assure you, friends, that this filth will not."
2,From a Jessica Simpson Fan,"I love Jessica Simpson...............unfortuntely, I don't like this cd nor her videos. She is a beautiful girl..........as everyone knows.......she is over sexing herself with her facial movements and low raspy voice. Christmas songs are not supposed to be over sexed, Jessica!! Anyhow, her voice is extremely over done!! She needs to see her voice coach!! And her husband needs to tell her the truth (someone) about how she's over doing it with her high pitched notes. You are a good singer...........every successful singer knows there vocal limits, Jessica..............you should too!!"
1,WHAT HAPPEN WITH YOUR HAIR?,"OMG! HAVE YOU SEEN THE COVER? WHAT HAPPEN WITH MISS LACHEY HAIR, WHY IS SO MESSEP UP, IF THE MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE HER HAIR IN THE COVER, WELL IT MUST BE BAD AND MESSY. JESSICA WHOEVER DID YOUR HAIR, HE MUST BE FIRED IMMEDIATLY...AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE OR SHE COMB YOUR HAIR AND THEN GRAB YOUR HEAD AND SHAKE IT, WASSUP WITH PEOPLE TODAY?...."
5,A Definate Must!!,"I am totally obsessed with this CD. I love the song Baby, It's Cold Outside. If you love Jessica Simpson, buy this album right now! She has a b-e-a-yooootiful voice in this CD and just makes your Christimas finished :o). Buy this CD! You won't regret it!"
4,HOLIDAY SPIRIT,"My mom wanted it for Christmas & loved it. It's very festive & puts you in the holiday spirit. I can only stand so much of her voice, but it's decent. It's not cheesy or over-the-top like some of the other Christmas cds."
5,Amazing,"I have had this CD since it first came out, and I never really took the time to listen to it. This year I really listened to it for the first time, and it has become my favorite Christmas CD. Jessica really does a wonderful job. My favorite song is ""Baby It's Cold Outside,"" which is a duet with her and her ex-husband Nick Lachey, it's my favorite version of that song."
2,Wow Couldnt Believe My Ears!,"All singers make Christmas CDs and some are really good and some make you think what they were thinking making that! And well, Jessica Simpson falls in that last one! I love the songs she picked but after what I heard I cant get it out of my head! She has an excellent voice but not for Christmas songs! This literally hurt my hears, and I had to turn it off! It is so not what i or anyone would expect from her! This CD is one shortage away from blowing up and i dont mean that in a good way!"
3,Different than expected,"Jessica Simpson used to have a very beautiful, strong voice. And sometimes on this cd, she still does. But other times, she sounds like she is pulling a muscle somewhere trying to get out the lyrics. But this cd does show that she still does have that voice, it just seems that someone is advising her to do the breathing into the mic thing a lot more than the singing into the mic thing. But this is not a bad cd, just not what you may expect a chrismtas cd to be. But she does sound as though she is having fun while she is singing these songs, and that is really what a christmas cd should be about. Any fan of Jessica Simpson would no doubt appreciate this cd!"
1,Surprisinly... horrible,I happen to like Jessica Simpson and was actually looking forward to this album coming out. This is the worst Christmas album I've ever heard!! I actually surprisingly cringed while listening to it. Her loud voice drowns out her duets with others and the slower religious songs sound too sexy for these types of songs. The faster songs she does OK but sounds childish. I am very disappointed with the entire thing.
2,Not very Christmasy to me,"I listened to all the clips and can say the only ones I liked were ""I saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus""- it fit her voice well-childish like but sexy. The other one I did like was ""Baby its cold outside"" because Nick sounded great and helped the song to be enjoyable. I felt too much of a sexual overtone on the other ones especially ""O holy Night"" and this really turned me off. It was OK to do this on a fun song but not these more religious songs.Could just be me though. Some may like it- I don't. Sorry Jessica, not your best work. Betting you will do well though."
2,Not worth the money.,"I love Christmas Music. I own about 25 different christmas CD's and I am also a big fan of Jessica Simpson. I own two of her albums and was very disappointed in the quality of this CD. she has an amazing voice and doesn't use it. Too many songs are sung in a breathy, little girl voice. She has amazing vocal capabilities why doesn't she use them? I ended up giving it to my niece who gave it back to me because she liked Mariah Carey's Christmas CD better. Can't say I blame her."
1,Too much air not enough sound,"I was a fan of Ms. Simpson when she first arrived on the scene. But, over the years she seems to have lost her voice but found her breath. On this album in particular, the listener hears the sound of wind coming in and out of her lungs not tones or notes. She is almost doing a Marilyn Monroe impersonation, which is sad. (O Holy Night, by the way, is not a jazz/R&B tune.) I'd go back to the drawing board and find the Jessica that came out a few years ago - the one with the set of pipes and not the cartoon character that she's become."
2,disappointed,"I was so excited for this album to come out b/c I haven't found a christmas album I really like since Mariah Carey's (still my fave), but I was really disappointed in it. I just don't understand why Jessica changes up her voice so much and tries to sound so raspy. She has such a beautiful voice that it's a shame she doesn't really use it. This is not by far the worst album I have ever heard, but I do agree that if you're not a die hard Jessica fan then I would not recommend it."
2,"meh...not horrible, not great","This CD isn't horrible, but it's pretty bland. She has a good voice, but she doesn't use it on this album. Either she's trying to purr like Britney or scream like Christina, but she doesn't manage to do either one quite as good. Jessica, stick to pop music, Christmas music is not for you."
3,Mediocre,"There are some songs on this album that are quite enjoyable and are excellent at putting one in the Christmas spirit. But there are, however, a handful of stinkers in here. They bring the quality of the album down for me. For instance, in ""Baby it's Cold Outside,"" a duet with her husband, Jessica's voice is extremely breathy, while Nick's voice is clear and precise. It's definitely a strange track. I think ""The Little Drummer Boy"" is the stand out track on this album. It's very fun and festive, and Ashlee's voice adds some needed edge. There are a few other good ones, such as ""What Child is This"" (though Jessica sounds like she's holding back, her voice is still great on this one). ""O Holy Night"" is jazzy and pretty good. All in all, this cd is great if you're willing to skip through the bad songs. But when listened to straight through, it's a bit of a disappointment, especially for a Jessica Simpson fan."
5,"Beautiful voice, wonderful song choices",I love this DVD. The songs she chose are a good mix of traditional christmas songs and ones that are less popular. Her voice is beautiful and gives all the traditional songs a new life. The additions of her sister and husband are nice touches as well. Her duet with Nick is so beautiful. I will listen to this CD even after Christmas is over.
5,Jessica Does an Awesome Job!,"I am not a big fan of Christmas albums, but I really enjoyed listening to this one. Jessica sings all of the songs with a beautiful harmony and tone. The way she sings all the songs, even the slow ones, makes Christmas seem to always be a happy and harmonious time.I am now looking for other Christmas albums, since listening to hers made me want to listen to others. Imagine that! :o) Wonderful job, Jessica!"
1,another horribly cynical marketing exercise,"We all know to expect the worst at this time of year and to prove our fears were valid here comes dear Jessica's latest attempt to milk the most out of the festive season. As one commentator noted, Jessica has spent the last year or so writhing around on the bonnet of a car wearing next to nothing and now she's asking us to buy her devout Christmas CD! And it's called Re-Joyce for her recently deceased grandmother - well, as she's already exploited her marriage on reality TV, why not turn to dead nana? To be honest, Simpson once had a powerful and pure, if unsubtle, voice but on this set it's all breathiness and coy sweetness. For those who want to listen to seasonal music outside of the shopping malls, there are plenty of legitimate Christmas CDs around. But not this one. Avoid at all costs."
5,"A Very ""Simpson"" Christmas","Beautiful album. Jessica's voice is beyond stellar on these holiday classics. Her voice is most spectacular on the classic ""What Child is This"". She belts some amazing notes in the last few verses o the song. ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" is a beautiful rendition with the amazing choir in the background. Jessica's vocals shine beautifully also in this tune. You can tell she is trained in the gospel realm. The orginal song co-written by Jessica ""It's Christmas Time Again"" is one of my favorites on the album. It is a very catchy tune.The duet with hubby Nick Lachey is another highlight of the album in ""Baby It's Cold Outside"".All in all, one of my favorite holiday albums. A must have for any Jessica fan and Christmas collection."
1,CRAP!!!,"Jessica singlehandedly butchered every single Christmas song she recorded! She clearly has no idea how to sing properly. Buy Clay's Christmas album instead, it won't make your ears bleed."
1,Skip It,"Worst Christmas album I've ever heard, bar one. The vocals are atrocious and the production is cheap and rushed. Jessica, do us a favor and just give it up. Nobody likes your singing or your ridiculous facial spasms."
1,Oh lord...,"Just when I thought she couldn't get any worse, she managed to massacre Christmas songs... completely massacre. Reminds me of the stench Britney left behind when she remade Sonny &Cher's ""And The Beat Goes On"" & Madonna's remake of ""American Pie"". Leave the originals alone, guys... these are bland & horrible..."
2,Happy Homogenized Christmas!,"It's a perfectly plain and digestible Christmas album, just don't expect to be moved. You're better off with Mariah Carey's ""Merry Christmas"" instead.The best example of how bland this album is her and ex-hubby Nick Lachey's version of ""Baby it's cold outside.""It's just about the deadest rendition of this song ever. It's a nuanced and funny song that's she turns humorless and forgettable -- no easy feat. Listen to just about any other version and you'll see, I recommend Brian Setzer's duet with Ann Margaret.Do yourself a favor and look for a Christmas album that's a little more heartfelt."
4,Surprised how much I like this!,"I picked this up on a whim without listening to any of the tracks first. I was prepared to be disappointed, as I haven't liked Jessica Simpson's treatments on songs recently--too overwrought and strangely breathy. But--surprisingly--this cd hasn't left my stereo since I bought it! LOVE ""Oh Holy Night""--the arrangement is gorgeous, and shows off her vocal prowess. ""Let it Snow"" is a fun, jazzy romp. ""Breath of Heaven"" is beautiful, and I'd love to check out Amy Grant's original version. Could do without ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"", but the rest of this cd is just perfect for tree decorating, cookie baking, and snuggling up to a fire with some hot chocolate. The breathiness is still there, and that's a drawback, but it's not as annoying, for some reason, on Christmas music. I'd recommend this."
1,southern gospel? nightclub? what is she doing?,"There is a hint that Jessica has a good voice, but apparently she is not sure where she belongs. Some of the songs have a southern Gospel feel, and I must confess, that personally, I do not like that wailing type of music. But, if you do, you will like SOME of the tracks. However, on other tracks, she uses this breathy quality, that I suppose, is trying to imitate a sexy nightclub singer. These two styles do not work well together. Except for die-hard Jessica fans, this is not a particularly good album. It is ho-hum pop and even less attractive as Christmas music. At times I am reminded of Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President."" The problem is that Marilyn was NOT known as a singer. Jessica needs to rethink her presentation. Only buy this album if you think Jessica is the greatest thing since Edison invented the light bulb."
1,give me a break,"you are horrible you dont need to be doing this album, look at you on the front cover, you look like your possing for a nude magazine.......its christmas album!! and you can't sing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Worst Christmas album EVER!!,Jessica's xmas album sucks there is no Soul in it at all.. Jessica needs to stop tryin to copy Mariah Carey cause she cant!!... Jessica is overrated and so is her big-noise husband and wannabe punk sister Ashlee...DONT BUY THIS XMAS ALBUM IT SUCKS JESSICA SOUNDS AWFUL SHE OVER-SINGS AND TRYS TO HARD I HATE IT.. GO BUY INSTEAD MARIAH'S XMAS ALBUM OR EVEN CHRISTINA'S XMAS ALBUM SHOOT EVEN CLAY AIKENS...
1,Is this supposed to be Christmas music?,"I saw the commercial for this CD on television recently and I winced at my television set. I like Jessica Simpson, heck, I own all of her CD's previously released before this, but what did she do to traditional music? I couldn't believe my ears, she butchered these songs with her childlike, breathy tone. If you want real Christmas music, I would suggest buying Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, or Christina Aguilera's christmas albums, not this. This project, I hope, will be buried and never brought out to listen to at Christmas or any other day again."
2,I love Jessica but HATE this album.,"I was very excited to buy this cd and rushed to Newbury Comics yesterday to buy it the day it came out. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed. Jessica has a lovely voice but she holds back on this album. Something is missing.I don't recommend buying this cd- it will tarnish your opinion of this otherwise wonderful singer."
2,Not a very good Christmas album,"This album seems really dull. Jessica didn't not do well on this Christmas album. Her vocals, to me, sounded pretty bad. I think she could have tried a bit harder to make the songs more fun, since a lot of the songs are dull ballads. I really, really did expect more from Jessica, since her other albums are really good, but this one is really dull. However, I did like Ashlee's part in Little Drummer Boy and she should make a Christmas CD. But for Jessica, this Christmas CD isn't worthwhile, and only big fans of Jess should buy. Very, very bland and boring. Only recommended for big fans of Jess."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I bought this for my best friend, who is a huge Jessica Simpson fan, and wound up being extremely impressed with what I heard. Her duet with Ashlee is superb, and I find this album refreshing compared to some other Christmas albums."
2,No more singing!!!,"hmm yes i do like jessica simpson, no i do not like her singing. when she sings she tries too hard. its not natural and smooth its rough and loud and annoying! i got this christmas album because i was in a christmassy mood, but this is the worst christmas album EVER! im sorry jessica...but u should stick to acting. like the other commenters i recommend mariah carey or christina aguilera also. jessica is not that christian soul singing girl anymore...her voice has just gotten a little annoying...even her sister ashlee simpson has an annoying raspy voice...listen to the clips and hear for urself. personally i do not recommend this ablum to anyone but a hardcore jessica simpson fan."
3,"Take a Breath, but Keep on Singing","Wonderful, trying a little to hard, and, is she breathless, are words that to me describe this CD! Jessica does a wonderful job showing off her vocals and picks great songs to sing, my favorite was ""baby it's cold outside"" she sang it strong. Sometimes she it seems like she is screaming at me. She needs to just sing not over sing, if you know what I mean. And the breathless part, it is clear to see that with her wonderful vocals sometimes she needs to stop and take a big, long breath. I like the album, but, I don't love it."
2,Ashelle needs her own xmas album,"I love it that Ashlee sings on this cd...she sounds way better than Jessica.... especualy at singing christmas music.Speaking of music, I love the violin in What Child is This, and Nick and Jessica sound okay singing Baby It's Cold Outside."
4,Not bad....,"I actually think this might be the best album that Jessica Simpson has put together. She does a pretty good job at her rendition of O HOLY NIGHT. THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY has to be highlight on this disc, as her voice and the music behind her, are in perfect step, creating a great Christmas song. Granted, Jessica's voice is highly nasal, and can get annoying at times, but she can still sing when she wants to. I think this album has to be one of her best to date, and perhaps, is showing us the evolution of Jessica Simpson from teen pop sensation into a more mature adult contemporary star."
2,From a Jessica Simpson Fan,"What has happened to Jessica Simpson? She is such a talented artist and can out-sing just about everyone else out there. But recently she's gotten into a weird gimick-type singing style. It reminds me of Britney who needs gimicks to pull people in because her true talent is lacking, but Jessica?It's really a shame. I'll buy one more of Jessica's CD but it she doesn't stop this nonsense, I'll stop buying her CDs for good.Someone in her inner circle needs to tell her to go back to her roots."
3,More Jessica...,This CD got boring after the first few songs. They all began to sound alike...for me not a good mix.
2,"Good song choices, wrong voice","I love the songs that were on this cd and thats why I bought it. However she over does many of the words in the song turning a listener off. Nick and Ashlee both do good jobs which saves her in some of them. Would not recommend, rather go with Trans-Siberan Orchestra."
2,Painful to listen to,"My ""sounds of the season"" music channel has been playing the Jessica Simpson/Nick Lachey version of ""Baby, It's Cold Outside,"" and I go running for my Christmas CDs every time I hear it. Nick does an acceptable job but Jessica races through the lyrics, injecting not one iota of feeling into what should be a teasingly sexy song. Check out the Vanessa Williams/Bobby Caldwell version (among others) to see what I mean."
2,Dissapointed,"I don't own any Jessica Simpson CD's but I do like her overall. I thought with her powerful voice it would be a great CD, however, on this CD she sings with that whispery trying-to-be sexy voice and it annoys me! The only song worth listening to on the CD is the duet with sister Ashley ""Little Drummer Boy"". Don't waste your money!!!"
1,Atrocious,don't even think about buying this! she butchers absolutely every song and sounds like a dying cow. do us all a favor [...] and quit the business now before you suffer any more public embarassment.
1,scissor sisters rule,I used be a born again christian but after listening to thisdrivel I am now an aetheist. She ruined Christmas for me. I can no longer look forward to happy Santas and gleefully opening gifts on Christmas morning. First dumping Nick and now dumping this on us ! Thanks a lot Jessica.Saint Nick
1,Not one I'd recommend!,"Eew...didn't know Jessica Simson even sang and when I heard ""Breath of Heaven"", I was glad I hadn't known!! Again I say EEW!! What an awful compilation of a very, very beautiful and meaningful song!!!! For those of you that thought this song was pretty -- you should hear how it ought to be sung. If you get a chance, listen to Amy Grant's Christmas Album that features it...now that's BEAUTIFUL!!!! Definately WOULD NOT recommend this album of Jessica Simpson with all the breaks in her voice and breathy quality....Sorry, Jessica!"
5,"rythym, best of scofield","Agree with all the 5 star reviews. Could be my favorite Sco album, along with A Go-Go. Just great rythym on most of the tunes, and Sco's great signature guitar funk. Happy i finally got introduced to this great album."
1,Cheaply made. Don't waste your money.,"I was excited to get this for my son, but I was extremely disappointed when I took it out of the box. This toy is so cheaply made, it's embarrassing. The cash register doesn't stay on the scanner, it falls off continuously, making the scanner non-functioning. The number key pad on the register is one big square, not individual numbers. That was a big disappointment since I can't tell my son how much something is and have him punch in the price. The ""food"" it comes with is made out of flimsy cardboard (except for a couple of plastic items) which were destroyed by my son within minutes after trying to scan them. It's too bad, because this is such a cute idea, and my son really liked the scanner when it worked. It became more frustrating than fun after a little while though. I can't believe how difficult it is to find a well made item like this. Don't waste your money on this one. It's a piece of junk."
2,Looks Great but poor quality,"This toy looks good in pictures but the quality is quite poor. For example, the buttons look like individual buttons but they're not. My kids want to push buttons and open the drawer but it's just one solid chunk of buttons. Not very fun to push or play with. The conveyer belt is spotty at best. Sometimes it works but most of the time it doesn't. The food is all cardboard that flattens out during the first play. They're are definitely better cash registers out there!"
2,Won't hold up very long - major issues with functions,"I bought this with high expectations and I am afraid that I was disappointed. Several other reviewers have mentioned these issues, but here are the major problems with this:1. The play food that comes with the set is made of flimsy cardboard and doesn't hold up at all.2. The checkout is in 2 pieces that hook together, but it comes apart if you move it at all.3. The buttons are not individual for the register, and act as one big button4. The beeping mechanism is hard to get to beep without pushing down on it pretty hard.I would expect quality of this type for an item under $15, not above $30."
2,Not worth the cost!! Frustrated the kids,"I bought this item for several reasons, The working belt and the ability to scan and add up items. The Belt is the only thing that is nice about this toy. The scanner makes an annoyiing BUZZ and the numbers sort of spin. The unit is also in two pieces and falls apart easily making the kids frustrated. It is a very expensive toy that sits in the corner and does not get played with very ofter."
2,"Playing at the Wee Wee!,","Using this toy can be extremely fun if you are rich but if you are poor, the educational value diminishes because many young children do not have any money to go to the grocery store to buy things. This takes 4 DD batteries which are used for the laser light for credit cards (be careful not to look directly at the light when putting card through). It can be fun though if you want to play inside on a cold rainy day or if your friends went to the park and left you alone."
4,A definite improvement on the original release,"The Complete Budokan captures Cheap Trick at their rowdiest. Energized by the crowd of admiring fans, they rip through a set of their early rockers and rarely slowdown for the length of the two CD set. This CD captures the concert experience better than most and only the excess of an 8:54 ""Need Your Love"" slows things down. If you like your Rock and Roll hard, fast, and loud this CD is for you."
4,This is the ticket.,"This is the one. Great to have the whole show, surprising how heavy Cheap Trick was in the early days. Let your inner Japanese schoolgirl get her scream on."
4,"Awesome Album, But What's With the Changes!?","This is a great album, even greater now in its completeness. But I was shocked to hear that the version of ""Goodnight"" on ""The Complete Concert"" is different from the one on the original album. I loved how Zander's voice gave out several times during the first few lines of the song on the original album--he had rocked so hard his vocal cords couldn't hold up. Awesome! On this complete concert, his voice sounds fine all the way though! What gives!?You can hear the old version on the MP3 sample that Amazon makes available for those purchasing the original CD. Compare for yourself--the difference is marked.Anyway, I'm disappointed to find that the complete concert is not just the old album with the left-out songs added. I don't know if the version of ""Tonight"" is a version from a different night or if they ""fixed"" the original one. Either way, a disappointment. Still, overall a classic and worth picking up."
3,Not really remastered,"I'm a big fan of remastered albums because usually the improvement in sound quality is dramatic. This is the first supposedly remastered CD I've bought where there is no discernable difference between the originally released CD and the remastered version - on any equipment that I have. Therefore, do not buy this for better sound compared to the original release. Buy it only if you want the whole concert and not the original abbreviated version. (Though, I agree with the other reviewer that the original version is tighter and a better listening experience.)"
3,They Should Have Left It Alone,"It's very simple; the added material may be of interest to utterly hardcore Cheap Trick fans, but it slows down the concert, and robs the original LP of much of its impact. More isn't necessarily better, and whomever edited the original LP version selected the best cuts, in the best order, and came up with a real fast, compact record. My advice: if you remember the original LP, then buy the CD of the original LP, not this version."
2,Haydn on the Tundra,"Comrades, I've had this set for many years but I have never warmed to it: there is no entropy in ice-cold vinegar. One day, I'm sure, I'll open up the case and find a frozen mammoth inside.All of the innate heat has been dissipated by the mindless, life-sapping, phrase-gnawing adherence to period practice. If you were to inform me that the Quatuor Festetics consisted of Jeggy and Rene Jacobs on violins, the late Gustav Leonhardt on viola and Corporal Hogwood on the cello and their Opus 64 was recorded in Smolensk in the middle of December where these doughty musicians had been clad only in their longjohns, guess what: I would believe you.Opus 64 should not be an attempt to break the barrier of absolute zero. These masterworks are aptly served by the Mosaiques Quartet:(Haydn: String Quartets Op 64 Nos 2, 4, 5 /Quatuor MosaiquesHaydn: String Quartets Op 64 Nos 1, 3, 6 /Quatuor Mosaiques.Turn your huskies towards these warmer climes."
4,Nice!,"If you ever thought it would be like to strap on a pair of sunglasses and protect the world's most important leaders, this book is for you....great pics and tons of great info!"
1,Worst book ever made,"I have an answer to the question now of what is the worst book I have ever read. This book takes the cake hands down. Take away the glossy pictures and you are left with a cold, frozen, solid turd hidden under a layer of snow. Coincidently, that is also its value..."
2,A Let-down,"I was surprised at the low durability of this product since I had also purchased the School House from Learning Resources at the same time. The figures of the School House were much more durable. After two hours of playing with this Royal Palace, one the arms of one of the figures fell off. The heads of the figures are very wobbly too.However, I appreciated the fact that the figures are not all white people. The castle itself seems good."
4,Good Toy but not the favorite,I got this for my son for his 3rd birthday. He has played with it here and there but not his favorite. It's really cute though if your child is in to castles. The horse and buggy are awesome but the horse legs are a little unsteady.
5,Everyone should listen to Cristina!,Cristina Branco is spectacular. I don't understand a word she's singing (because I don't speak Portuguese) but it doesn't matter. I'm totally swept away by her beautiful expressive voice highlighted by the spare but elegant production on the album. I purchased this CD as a gift for a friend and now she's a total fan.
2,unimpressive,"This album is fado diluted by ""adult contemporary"" musical drivel. A dissatisfying cocktail, indeed. I suggest sticking with Mariza."
3,Small amount of information,"There was insufficient information concerning this subject. The knowledge of enzymes is vast, and this booklet covers only a small portion."
1,A very poor book,"Davidson clearly embellished many of the interviews he claimed to have had with various people including Tracy himself. This book is extremely inaccurate and unnecessarily lurid. For more balanced books on Tracy read Tracy and Hepburn by Garson Kanin, the Tracy biography by Larry Swindell and the really good Spencer Tracy Bio-bibliography by James Fisher."
2,too little for too much,The concept is great. I am an aesthetician and I really like the no mess and it works. However the cartridge is very small it is not enough for a full leg waxing. It is not economical. If you use two cartridges for waxing it's costing you almost as much like you go to a salon. To find replacement cartridge is very hard and expensive.Overall it is a good idea but needs lots of impruvements.
1,Waste of Money,I tried it twice and threw it in the trash. The unit is awkward to hold. The wax doesn't stay the correct temperature. Very hard to clean the unit when you are done and if you don't get it clean- forget trying to use it again. I had a hard time finding replacement wax.
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I bought this monitor and i never even got a chance to test it out. Because as soon as i turned it on once it was in the car it fryed my gamecube. not only did i return the monitor but i had to get a new system. i strongly advise not buying this product!!!! dont take the chance of blowing your system.
1,Terrible customer service,"We had a small problem with our unit (need a replacement cable). It's impossible to get an answer from customer service -- they do not return email messages, and there is no other contact information. We did like the unit when we could use it."
4,CAR,"my main question when i was researching this moniter is ""does it come with a car adaptor?"" i soon found that it does. and the car cigarette lighter adpter powers the gamecube also so you can play in the car right away once you get this. great buy."
5,Way better than InterAct,"Ok, this thing is WAY better than InterAct. It has TWO headphone jacks, AV cables, car adapter, speakers, high quality TFT LCD, doesn't box your cube, doesn't blur, hinges aren't broken, doesn't have a huge line across it, and it's NOT RECYCLED.It's also MUCH cheaper. This one is the best there is, so far. Don't waste time, money, and effort to get an InterAct Mobile Monitor."
4,Good screen but didn't get power source,"I order the screen for my grandson's Christmas. We didn't hook it up until March. That is when I found out I needed another power source for the screen (I ordered a car adapter for the Game Cube itself). I was not given any instructions on the screen needing an extra power source besides the one for the cube. That is frustrating, but we managed to find one at Radio Shack. It works really well, and my grandson is excited that he can now play it while we go on vacation. The seller needs to make sure that all info is with the product. I would have assumed that since we were ordering the screen we would receive all the hardware with it."
4,Good Screen Better Then Interacts!,This Product is great I like that it comes with the car adapter that powers the GC and the LCD using only one Lighter thing in the car. It most defininetly has better quality then the other brand. It only .4 tenths of an inch smaller and is immposible to tell the difference. It also has the capabilty of standing on its own. it plays DVD's And works with all gaming systems. Great buy. The only thing wrong with it is that the screen shakes slightly sometimes but otherwise worth the extra 30$.
2,Bad screen,The screen when I bought said that it had better graphics then a tv. Ha! The graphics on the moniter are terrible. It is blurry and fuzzy looking.
2,Is it big enough???,"This item looks great. A mobile monitor for the amazing Nintendo Gamecube system. Excellent for trips and boring places that don't have a T.V.!!! Well the screen is smaller than you think. Think of the top of your gamecube. The screen is 1/3 the size of the surface. For God's sake, you have to be a foot away from it and squint your eyes to see the blurred picture. Gamecube is too good to be affiliated with this. And don't think that this alone is bad. The Interact one is 100 times worse. Just forget about it. Don't waste [the money] which you can spend on three games. Just stick to a regular t.v."
5,Fasten your seatbelt,"As usual, Ms. Whitney weaves a fine story. But wait till you read the totally unexpected ending; it will knock your socks off."
2,"An agonizing drag, preposterous ending","The heroine, Carol, flees with her young son Keith to Palm Springs, California, to escape her violent ex-husband, Owen. In Palm Springs she seeks sanctuary at the gated estate of an aunt she had never met but with whom she had corresponded over the years. Her Aunt is a recluse but was once a famous Hollywood actress who ended her career abruptly under circumstances shrouded with mystery. Much of this novel is spent with Carol's agonizing over whether her ex-husband will snatch her son, Keith, as well as worrying about her fragile relationship with her aunt and whether her aunt will allow her and her son to stay at the estate. I did not enjoy this book at all. As a final insult, the ending was completely preposterous, even for fiction."
1,Snooze,This was my first Phyllis Whitney novel - it will probably be my last. I'll be very brief. Read the first 75 pages then skip to the end and read the last chapter. That's what I did. All of your questions will be answered and your suppositions confirmed. You'll feel like you really read the whole book.
5,Bread Heaven,"Margaux Sky's generosity in sharing her wonderful bread recipes with all of us is rivaled only by the generosity of the sandwiches she invents to fill the breads. I find her sauces particularly clever, adding enormous flavor and blending ingredients simultaneously. I have tried only a few of the recipes so far but all have been winners and I'm looking forward to tasting everything in time. The photographs are lush, able to stimulate an appetite all on their own. This is a marvelous small cookbook. If you are a bread lover, you must add this collection of bread recipes!"
1,I don't get it.......,I was very disappointed in this book. Thank goodness I bought it used. Even I can make better looking bread than this book and bread has usually been a challenge for me to get the perfect loaf. The photography is very nice to look at if you like looking at burnt bread all the time. The recipes do not sound good to me at all.....I bought it because of the title....I was looking for a sandwich/filling recipe book....I didn't even know who Margaux Sky was until I Googled it. Save your money and find something better!! (one star because you can't leave it blank!)
1,What could possibly contain this dough?,"I got this book for Christmas because I wanted to start baking my own bread, tried a batch, and then put it on the shelf. I pulled it out again today and was reminded why it has absolutely no use for me. The author clearly did not make any effort to make these recipes relevant for a home cook. The bread recipes call for 16 cups of flour! I have a Kitchenaid, but it can't deal with that. When I made the initial batch I dove in blindly and when all that dough started to rise it was unbelievable! I actually had to get out a large size turkey roasting pan to let the dough rise because nothing else could contain it. It was like a monster. I think the bread was good-don't really remember-I was too distracted by the every growing masses of dough all over my kitchen. I think I am going to send this book to Goodwill because unless I cannot envision a time that I will ever have access to the kinds of tools needed to deal with the quantities of bread made by this book."
1,Worst sandwich book ever,No. No. No. I thought the recipes in this book would be good because Oprah is fat and can afford the good stuff. I was wrong the recipes are gross. Nancy Silverton's sandwich book is way better.
3,Spend alittle more and get a bigger unit.,Although wax units are messy and time consumning they make your hands feel great. This unit is really too small. You have to almost stand up and place one hand in to cover the whole hand. If you are sitting down you can't bend your wrist enough to cover it. Large units may cost abit more but you can cover up to your wrist and use on your feet as well.
1,Just a word of warning.,"I bought a Denon AVR-3803. Sound to the back speaker failed. Bought from an authorized dealer, but it took Denon three months to ""fix it"". The fix lasted about two weeks. Great receivef\r (except difficult to figure out) but warranty repair service is terrible."
1,"Clear audio, but impossible to setup","The Denon brand name does not have a good reputation for nothing. This unit has excellent sound. HOWEVER, I have spent the entire last week reading through the manual trying to figure out how to ""setup"" this receiver. The manual is EXTREMELY poorly written. The person writing the manual took it for granted that the reader is high-tech, and consequently does not give good explanation in many areas of setup. Secondly, the remote control is the absolute worst that I have ever experienced, and I have owned lots of remote controls. In short, although this unit can possibly give you good sound if you are willing to spend the next six months trying to figure out how it works, you are much better off buying another brand that is easier and simple to setup. In fact, I am seriously thinking of selling my 3806 on Ebay and replacing it with an Onkyo receiver, probably the 805."
5,The right mood,"I have loved this Cd since I first owned it on vinyl and it never gets tired. 1.) Bob Malach is wonderful melodic player who can burn when the tune calls for it. 2.) The material is great! There's not a weak tune on the Cd, 3.) the musicianship all around is fantastic - Russell Ferrante, Steve Gadd, Tom Harrell. Robben Ford, Will Lee, Eddie Gomez, and Dr. John need I say more. If you liked to hear one of the most truly inspired one chorus solos on record listen to Malach's heart wrenching take on ""I Put a Spell On You"". It's the perfect foil to Dr. John's vocals. This record is funky, it swings, and it hypnotizes you. Someone get this guy back in the limelight and get a new CD out. Check his playing on Mike Stern's CDs also."
3,Great playing...but...,"This album is just not my style. While the musicians are certainly virtuosic, I prefer a different type of jazz. My favorite track is ""Touro Infirmary"", which features Dr. John who brings great enjoyment to me for an otherwise cheesy album. Still, I'm glad I've heard it, and Malach is a very talented player. To me, his playing is like a more reserved Brecker style, and I dig that!It was worth a shot...just not my thing:/"
1,Junk,"Too bad there isn't a zero in this rating system. I had an old remington that could handle everything I threw at it...until I lost the blade assembly. My wife picked up the conair for me...what a disappointment. It sounds like its working. But when you take it apart for post-op cleaning, there isn't a hair to be found! I end up plucking the ""strays"" with her tweezers (little does she know)! It uses a pretty dumb design; the blades stick straight out from the axis of rotation. Unless the hair is bent 90 degrees, it's simply going to smack off of the blade...just like a card wacking off the spokes of your bike when you wanted to sound like a motorcycle. Junk-air"
1,Conair does not work,"This plastic conair hair trimmer is not only junk, but it does NOT WORK AT ALL!!!! Once turned on, it can not cut anything. I have tried to cut hair in my nose, in my ears, and even hair on my arm, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! It does not work..."
1,Worked barely OK for a while...,"Worked kind of OK the first few times on nose hair. Very inferior performance on ear hair. It simply does not pick up hair reliably, especially from the surface of the ear. The barely passable performance degraded substantially after a few uses. On/off switch is extremely flimsy and now it works only if I keep on holding the switch by exerting pressure from a weird angle. Clearly a case of you get what you pay for. This is a cheap unit overall and I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Don't waste your money,"I thought ours was defective, but I guess they all work like ours do. I agree with the other people. Don't buy this."
1,Don't mean to pile on.....,"....but you really are wasting your money on this product. I bought it several months ago and while it would occasionally work it took an absurd amount of time for any results, and even then the results were uneven. I just bought a Panasonic and couldn't believe the difference: the results were instantaneous and outstanding. It made me realize what a piece of crap the Conair is. You could sit there for 45 minutes and still get zero results. Unbelievable. I would give it no stars if that was an option."
2,Great idea but damaged lid seal,"I bought this as a gift, along with a cookbook on casseroles, for my mom to take to church suppers. The recipients were loving it until they noticed that the lid had a broken seal, making it un-usable. No one wants to transport a casserole in a pan with a faulty lid.When attempting to exchange the item, Amazon customer service said there were multiple returns for the same reason. It could only be returned and refunded. Very dissatisfied with this product."
3,good---but,"I would have rated this a five star if the cover would fit. It is next to impossible to snap the lid on with out burning your fingers on the dish. The carrier, dish and hot-cold pad are well built. The lid is well built but too small."
5,CorningWare - always great!,It was a gift I was happy to give. I don't have 11 more words to write about this product.
3,Haven't Used It Yet,"This was a Christmas gift and thought I haven't yet used it, I was wanting a white piece to match other white serving pieces I have and the case is also a feature I was looking for. Seems to fill the bill."
3,Dont Let The Cover Fool You,This is the same DVD as Under-Review 1962-69 and the quality is not as good. Its a pretty good documentary but Ive seen better Stones documentarys so just be warned that its just a re-packaged item.
4,"Lots of imagery, no technique","I could'nt help reading the ""Excellent"" reviews before I wrote mine. Sloan has a powerful imagery and an explosive way of communicating it to the reader. I am specially impressed with her work since it's her first book ever. If you have technical aspects of voice under your belt (which is like having a thick crust already) Sloan's concepts would make a good icing. But the book is no substitute to a disciplined course in vocal technique. And as every aspiring singer should know no book no matter how inclusive can replace actual coaching from a teacher. Of course lots of books can supplement lessons from teachers and mentors. Singing is a spritual experiance and not just screaming to match pitches. If that's where you are lacking this book might open a door for you."
5,The Elusive Flame,This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's just the first of a great family saga.
4,Review for The Elusive Flame,"When Cerynise Kendall went to Beau Birmingham's ship to set off for Charleston, she didn't know what she was in for. With her guardian's grandson after her she needed help to escape. Beau married her and it was to be a marriage of convience, but that isn;t how it turned out."
2,Overwrought!,"Absolutely agree with reviewer: ""A reader from Levittown, Penna. USA , June 8, 1999""The heros were larger than life and the villians reminded me of Cruella Deville's side-kicks.Excellent potential; poorly written.What's happened, Kathleen?"
4,Woodiwiss definitely back in old form,"Cerynise is thrown out of her home after the death of an aunt, followed by a greedy cousin who wants the inheritance, and saved by our hero, Beauregard Birmingham. Only Beau just wants to transport her back to America and continue his sailing bachelor ways. But Cerynise has other ideas.This book has lots of dash, you don't have to wait forever for a good steamy scene, and not so much action that you get annoyed. Don't miss it."
5,YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT!,"This was my second book by Ms. Woodiwiss, the first being Flame and the Flower. While I loved Flame and the Flower, I feel The Elusive Flame is better. I couldn't put it down! I loved it, loved it, loved it! Buy it. You won't be sorry. Kathleen Woodiwiss has such an incredible gift for storytelling.Lastly, I wish I could find a man like Beau Birmingham! Only in romance novels!"
3,"A good story, but wished it had a bit more depth.","I enjoyed The Flame and the Flower but hadn't read a book by Woodiwiss in about 10 years. When I heard this story was the sequel, I got interested and read it. I wished Woodiwiss had written more about Heather and Brandon and his brother Jeff and perhaps the childhoods of Beau and Cerynise. I can't help but notice details, and felt it was a big error in how the author went back and forth with Beau's eye color! I am planning to purchase A Season Beyond a Kiss and hope that it doesn't begin with baby Marcus being 26 years old. With several references being made to adventures Beau had in Spain, I would like to see the new story take up with their planned sea voyage with Brandon and Heather. These characters are interesting and I think Woodiwiss should take advantage of that fact and not ""lose"" so many years in between sequels."
2,Still floundering,"It seems Kathleen Woodiwiss has forgotten what made her books successful in the first place: romance. _The Elusive Flame_ follows in _Petals on the River_'s footsteps by emphasizing plot, not the relationship between the hero and heroine. Really, who picks up a romance to read about the contrived schemes of boring villains? Yet this is what Woodiwiss' delivers in _The Elusive Flame_. More than half the book is about the hoodlums who follow Cerynise to America for greed and revenge. Worse than that, the romantic tension between Beau and Cerynise ends even before this. I lost interest after the couple realized they loved one another and there were no obstacles to hinder their relationship. Woodiwiss should remember that romances are not about the ""happily ever after,"" but what leads up to it."
2,lacks spice,"A disappointing sequel to Flame & The Flower. In Flame & Flower, I was riveted and completely caught up in the characters. Brandon and Heather were undeiably Woodiwiss' best creations. Beau and Cerynise never really captured my interest. They never developed a strong chemistry, and I never really felt strongly that they ""belonged"" together. This is the first time I've felt that way about 2 Woodiwiss characters. The villians were bumbling fools, and lacked the menace and sinister aura that earlier villians had. I felt like they were cartoon villians rather than the real thing. I hope, if Ms. Woodiwiss decides (and I hope she does) to do a book about the youngest sister, Brenna, it will be more interesting. I'm glad I read the book if only for the sake of reading about Brandon & Heather again. They'll always be my favorite characters."
1,"A ""Skip through the Pages"" book","I am not an avid ""Romance/Love Story"" person. When I first came across ""Rose in Winter"" by accident many years ago, I was impressed enough to read Mrs. Woodiwiss' other works. The plausibility, consistency and motivation in ""Rose in Winter"" were fabulous. ""The Elusive Flame"" is JUNK. All of the characters are unbelievable, their speech and their communication skills are elementary. Who is Mrs. Woodiwiss writing for? Who is your new target market? Go back and read your previous fiction, then look at other believable, heart-wrenching good love stories like ""Rebecca"" and give us something good."
2,The Elusive Flame,"What happened to the Woodiwiss I remember starting with ""The Flame and the Flower"" ""The Wolf and the Dove"", etc. They were so full of passion and rich character development. The woman characters now are modern day feminist not at all resembling their female counterparts of the 19th century and the male characters are weak, spineless fools. I miss the Woodiwiss stories which were truly historical romances and not modern day tales in historical settings all caught up in being politically correct and sugar coated so as not to offend."
4,Curl up and read!,"One of Woodiwiss's best! She is a master at the historical romance novel, and she never dissapoints! I would definately recommend this read to anyone that likes romance novels! She can make your heart hurt for a heroine like no one else!"
1,Don't Bother - Read Ashes in the Wind & A Rose in Winter,"How disappointing. This novel does not represent the Kathleen Woodiwiss I have loved for 15 years. I kept waiting for a story to unfold, with the rich character building and story lines that I'm used to from this author. But this book was slow, plotless, and BORING, BORING, BORING. It seemed that Ms. Woodiwiss borrowed scenes and different plot lines from many of her prior novels, then stuck them all together in this story. Read Ashes in the Wind (my copy is also quite worn) and A Rose in Winter to really appreciate what a wonderful author Ms. Woodiwiss is (was?). Petals on the River was different than her prior books, but it was a sweet, if short, story. I like that her characters are now waiting until love and marriage to have sex, rather than the typical rape scenes in these period romances. However, because of the lack of storyline in this book, I'll be hard pressed to purchase any future Woodiwiss novels."
3,A good beginning...,"This was my very first Woodiwiss novel. I enjoyed it, especially the beginning, but the end was lacking the excitment of the plot Woodiwiss had started. Another thing that annoyed me was Cerynise's constant backing away. That got really old really fast. Other than that, I believe it was a good book, just lacking a little excitement."
3,OK book----but the story gets old.,"This book started out great, however the Cerynise's ongoing hard-to-get behavior towards Beau gets old----very very old. I believe Ms. Woodiwiss could have written a better plot and love scenes."
3,Not nearly as exciting as The Flame and The Flower,"The very first romance novel I ever read was the Flame and the Flower,I was in high school at the time.The standard by which I judged other authors.So naturally when she came out with a sequal I jumped right on it(despite the rather high cost).I was greatly disappointed.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it. I just thought there could have been a little more about the rest of the Birmingham Family.I hope that she writes more books about the Birminghams,as long as she goes back to her old style and flare of writing.I have all of her novels and lately they have really been going downhill.This one was better then the last few. PLEASE KATHLEEN GO BACK AND READ SOME OF YOUR OTHER BOOKS,then write more like them.Please include something about the Birmingham girls."
1,This is not the Kathleen Woodiwiss I'm Accustomed To,"A voracious Woodiwiss reader, imagine my utter disappointment to pick this book up and find that Ms. Woodiwiss has apparently abandoned the same principles that made her a top-notch author. The dialogue is shallow, the storyline too simple, and sexual references leave nothing to the imagination. After reading this novel, I had to return to my worn-out copy of ""Ashes in the Wind"" to get that feeling of a true Woodiwiss storyline and heroine. Now THERE'S a great example of what makes Ms. Woodiwiss unique. Please do not deliver another ""Elusive Flame"" to the public - the dissapointment is more than I can bear."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I've missed the Woodiwiss ohenomena and when I hear she's back to writing, I pounced on this one to see if she's the great writer everyone says she is.Well, if she is, she's not my cup of tea, however. This book could've been fun and readable, but there are so many things that irritated me no end. The villian, for one, is hilariously over-the-top. He doesn't speak - he snarls, growls, stamps his feet, grabs people by the hair, et cetera. The really diabetic prose, such as love declarations complete with stars and moons, made me burst out laughing. And I can't help comparing this artist heroine to other heroines who are artists, like Rebecca in Mary Jo Putney's ""River of Fire"" - the latter is a REAL artist with emper tantrums and passion. Cerynise seems to be drawing for fun. Hmmm."
1,"Dissapointment!! Shallow, boring,","Being a reader of Ms. Woodiwiss, I'm wondering if this is the same author. I have copies of ""The Wolf and the Dove"", ""A Rose in Winter"", "" Ashes in the Wind"", and ""Shana"". These books have been read and re-read and ejoyed with every reading.The Elusive Flame is a great dissapointment. I found the story line lacking. The story itself along with the characters shallow. The villians were obviously nothing more than the Keystone Cops. The book was a total waste of time, costly and within days of reading found itself at the County Dump.Ms. Woodiwiss, if your really still there, please find your way back."
1,Very disappointing,"I read The Flame and the Flower, Shanna etc. when I was in Hong Kong about 15 years ago. I have searched high and low for other novels by this author and was chuffed to bits to get hold of this one..........but what a disappointment, what a let down. I was really miserable by the time I finished. It didn't hold my interest at all, and I got to the point where I didn't really care what happened to the characters. Is this really by the same author??"
2,"Sorry, but I was disappointed......","As wonderful a writer that Woodiwiss is, she appears to have lost her imagination. Gorgeous young woman suddenly alone meets hunky, usually filthy-rich man, they create an imagined problem between them which keeps them from each other sexually, but which does not stop them from toying with each other until they finally end up in the sheets where the virginal woman is suddenly the best lover the hunk has ever had and he can't imagine another, but their new found love and happiness is short-lived now the villian(s) that were briefly mentioned in the beginning of the book are now back with a vengeance, but now time the villian is being helped by a nasty, but beautiful woman who had known the hunk previously and had intentions of having him for herself. Does this sound remotely familiar???? I need more story than this same scenario book in and book out. Come on, Kathleen, you are a wonderful writer, show us what you've got!"
5,"As always, romance and mystery superiorly entwined!","Once again, Kathleen E. Woodiwiss kept me at the edge of my seat. I started reading her novels at the age of 15, and now, 10 years later, I am still enjoying them over and over. Her books hold my attention so well, it is almost impossible to put them down. I enjoy her writing so much, I even chose the name Lierin from ""Come Love A Stranger"" for my daughter's name. If you enjoyed The Flame and the Flower, this book will be for you! I eagerly anticipate any following novels!!!"
2,This is better than Woodiwiss'last novel but still lacking.,I found this book very hard to get caught up in. While I was glad at the end I read it I was tired of the main characters addressing each other as maam and sir. There were no 'sparks' between Cernyse and Beau. The two villains Winthrop and Rudd were heavily involved in the beginning and then did not show up until the end again which did not make much of a story line. Not the best Woodiwiss I've read.
3,good,"Kathleen Woodiwiss introduced me to romance. I went out and bought all her books after reading SHANA,and loved everyone of them. I enjoyed THE ELUSIVE FLAME but was disappointed with the beginning of the book and almost put it down. Her two characters Winthrop and Rudd were complete idiots and not worthy of Woodiwiss, after I got through their ridiculous antics I thoroughly enjoyed the book"
3,good but not great,"As the sequel/continuation to Flame and the Flower, it lived up to my expectations, but it was pretty slow at times causing the story to lack in excitement the way that FATF's every paragraph held some excitment. At times, EF seemed to have excessive explication. Nevertheless, it was absolutely entertaining and enjoyable. I recommend it to Woodiwiss lovers, if only for a further glimpse of Heather and Brandon."
3,Long awaited sequel falls short,"""The Flame and the Flower"" and ""The Wolf and the Dove"" were my first exposures to the world of romance and I eagerly sought Woodiwiss novels as a result. This book only satisfied my curiosity as to what happened to Heather and Brandon. Cerynise too easily falls into Beau's arms and he forgives her too quickly when he is told she is pregnant. A little too weird for someone who doesn't even clearly remember the act. I think I had the most trouble with those points. And I agree...what is the deal with Beau's eye color? Very definitely, I recall them to be green when he was a baby."
2,It was a disappointment,"I loved the first Woodiwiss books, The Wolf & the Dove, The Flame and the Flower, and Shanna. From there, at least for me, it went downhill. Her style of writing changed, from exciting dialogue and action between the characters, to flowery wordiness. The last three of her books I've had to force myself to keep reading, hoping that somewhere in the book is the fire that hooked me in her first book. She's gone from heroines with a can-do attitude to simpering victorian misses. What happened?"
4,Another winner for Woodiwiss,"After reading The Flame and the Flower so long ago, it took me a little while to connect Beau with Brandon. Once the lightbulb went off, the fun began! This was a good sequel to the original. The writing was sensual without a lot of offensive language. The main characters were lively and believable. I really laughed a lot at the end. It reminded me of the movie Home Alone with some of the antics. If you enjoyed this book, make sure to read Petals on the River."
2,not nearly as good as hoped,"I first read Shanna 25 years ago and have read every one of Woodiwiss' books since then. I have loved most of the characters, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the characters of Cerynise and Beau were lackluster and hard to warm up to. The only other problem I have with her most recent books is the excessively flowery language and the totally cliched euphemisms Woodiwiss uses in her sex scenes. I had my fill of manly chests and heaving busoms. Her villians were caricatures and there was no suspense involved at all as to whether their nefarious schemes would bear fruit. All in all, very disappointing."
3,Not Read Yet,"Haven't read it yet, so can't really review it. I'm sure it will be as good as her other books."
3,Cool blue toothbrush!,"This is one of three different brands and/or models of rotary toothbrushes I have recently purchased. ( Three kids = three different toothbrushes!) Reasons to like this one are that it is very portable, the cool blue color makes it easy to tell from other toothbrushes that may be in your bathroom, and it is fun. (Anything that encourages toothbrushing and is effective can't be bad, can it?) On the downside, I am having difficulty locating replacement heads for this brush. Supposedly, replacements are available, but where to find them is a very important question to ask yourself before you purchase the toothbrush."
2,"cool, but not a puppet!","In the description and on the tag it clearly states that this is a puppet. Fearing that public schooling had once again lead me astray I googled the term puppet.here's what I came up with:Definition of PUPPET1 : a small-scale figure (as of a person or animal) usually with a cloth body and hollow head that fits over and is moved by the hand""(No)2: marionette(No)3: one whose acts are controlled by an outside force or influence(so far it just sits there, but I'll keep you posted)After much deliberation I have concluded that I am the puppet. My act of purchasing this item has been influenced by an outside force (the manufacturer's inaccurate description) and based upon that I have made an ill advised purchase.I feel slightly screwed and if this is the shipper's intention than they should have just mailed me B003IWJSP0."
3,seems like a quality product...,now if I could just figure how to use all the functions. Directions are difficult to folow and not straight forward. Disappointed that it is not a simple process.
1,Talking Pedometer,The comsupmtion rate of the battery life is too fast. Would prefer a lighter and smaller pedometer.
1,"""Temporary Labels"" for LONGTERM storage medium???",Pointless product. No point backing up data onto CDs and DVDs when the labels will fade at around 6 months.Garbage.
2,DYMO CD/DVD LABELS,"IT PRINTS OFF CENTER NO MATTER WHAT I DO. I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE. I ADJUSTED THE LABELS BUT IT STILLS PRINTS OFF CENTER. FOR MY USE I CAN GET BY, BUT FOR A PROFESSIONAL DISC, IT RATES NO STARS."
3,Hook with sinker,"The Hook starts out with the impression that you'll be in for a great ride. This ride slows down towards the middle of the book. The suspense is not here. The suspense that could have been, isn't. The actual murder happened before it could even begin to get suspenseful. The relationship between Bryce and Wayne struck me as really odd and the agreement seemed all to casual to seem real. This was a quick, interesting read, but nothing I'd go out of the way to recommend.."
1,The Drag,"I have read other Westlake books and, after reading the Hook, he needs to stay with his Dortmunder series. I say this because I think he is best when he employs humor to add to his mysteries. The Hook goes nowhere. There is not much complex plotting at all--a writer who has writer's block decides to kill his wife from whom he is getting a divorce. He manuevers a writer friend to do the deed in return for taking the writer's manuscript and turning in to a best seller. Thus both will get rich and Bryce Proctorr will be rid of his estranged wife. This is a hackneyed plot and after the murder very little happens to move the story along. The characters are wooden, the setting barren, and the tone too matter-of-fact. For me this was a real comedown from The Ax, which was much more complex as a story and, it seems to me, written with more penache."
3,Hooked on Psychophonics,"This is a good book, well-written and compact, and that may be it's biggest drawback. Westlake doesn't give us anyone to really ""root for"" in the novel and without that, you're left with a professional study of two obsessive and equally demented minds. The murder is delivered with quite a punch, but the subsequent scenarios are meandering and forced at times. The resolution at the end, however, does make you both wince and smile!A good quick read."
1,STOPPED READING IT AFTER 60 PAGES,"Not very good, in my opinion. Stopped reading it after 60 pages and threw it in the garbage."
3,3 1/2 stars - Not as hooked as I hoped to be,"I wish I could use half-stars in Amaxon ratings. This books is better than the three stars I give it but certainly not a four-star thriller like ""The Ax.""The plot, clearly a riff on ""Strangers on a Train"" is rather clever and I never quite know where's it's going. But then it just gets there, and ends. I feel like Westlake needs another 30 pages to build up to that ending - can he borrow a few from Stephen King next time? :)A lot rings trues about the lead characters, and Westlake doesn't spend too much time talking about the intricacies of writing and publishing (a flaw in far too many books about writers). But I don't feel like the big payoff matches the set-up. This is a more enjoyable book in many ways than ""The Ax"" - it lacks the darker edge of Westlake's surprisingly sharp political commentary - but i just wish it went somewhere more interesting."

1,Lame rip-off comes up for air,"This also-ran 80's sex comedy is getting trotted out again simply because Tom Hanks is in it.Don't waste your time -- the National Lampoon's franchise did it earlier and better. Hanks at best can affect a half-baked Bill Murray imitation.Yes, there are plenty of T&A; shots and potty jokes, but many other movies before or since have done it much better. Try the American Pie series if you want to see authentic teenagers in adolescent hijinks. Try Animal House if you want a far funnier party movie.Avoid this at all costs..."
1,One Line Review,It's a wonder anyone in this tasteless comedy ever made another movie again...or won an Oscar...much less two.
3,Animal House & Vaction ...,This movie is pretty decent.......It wasn't as good as Vaction or Animal House but I did laugh at a few parts....and not just every movie makes me laugh......!! I especially liked Tom Hanks character....he was hillarious.....
1,Gypsy? You do realise as a supposed Roma that's offensive rightt?,Everything written by this supposed Romanichali is a load of romanticized tripe exclusively for the starry eyed novice Gadge practitioner market who has not even a clue of what Roma culture and folklore is.Please avoid purchasing or supporting this individual in any way shape or form. There are so many reliable resources online on the truth behind our culture such as the Patrin journals.
5,Great book.Well written. Very informative re;pharmaceuticals,I read this book a few years ago and mention it to many of my associates in academia. It is a must read for people who are professors at pharmacy schools.
3,A fly-on-the-wall view of a start-up,"I thought this book was a really interesting insight into what it takes to start a drug company. Being a grad student in biology, I'm definitely open to non-conventional academic options and I read this book because of that. Thrilling and well-written, Barry Werth gave an intimate account of the gruelling process of starting an independent drug company. The narrative got rather boring at times, but overall it's a worthwhile read."
1,Negative stars!!!!,Absolutely horrible! Musicians can't find the tunes and the vocals are off key. Sort of reminds you of fingernails on a blackboard.
3,not enough,"this book is full of ""rule of thumbs"". it is very shallow. i didnt find it efective enough and for sure much too expensive for its added value."
1,Buy a different book,"92 pages if you don't count the appendixSeriously lacking in any substance if you are looking for a bullet point book this is great but if you really want any kind of detail buy a different book. I was actually wondering if he is charging by the word,it only took an hour and a half to read."
1,Be wary of overly educated intellectuals.,"By that, I mean people who have spent their entire life in academia, without setting foot in the real world. Point in fact, this quote from Mr. Paul Samuelson: ""What counts is results, and there can be no doubt that the Soviet planning system has been a powerful engine for economic growth.... The Soviet model has surely demonstrated that a command economy is capable of mobilizing resources for rapid growth."" That was in 1985, just a few short years before that ""powerful"" engine collapsed, bankrupt and faltering for decades. Where was Paul? With his nose in a book, without a clue. For some reason, these people receive Nobel prizes, even when they couldn't be more wrong. Then, they teach our youth. Sad."
1,This book is not for Baseball buffs,I bought this book many years ago. I'm surprised it's still in print -- It should have never been in print. It is a contrived historical novel with fictional characters of zero intrest. ...
5,A Treasure,"Really not much to say in addition to the wonderful reviews other than READ this book. It's beautiful in it's simplicity, story and language. The voice of the narrative is so authentic, the baseball is educational, but the book is a lot more than just a baseball book. It's a glimpse into America's past in so many ways with baseball being the central piece. Highly reccomend!!"
2,What a joke this book is,"It's funny...I read the books for the Billy Walters gambling book and never understood why everyone hated Konik so much. I guess it's because the other characters were so interesting. Then I read this book. It's hilarious. Yes, he does play in the World Series of Poker 13 years ago. Great. He also whines about which of his gorgeous, amazing, hot girlfriends hurt him. Ha. Whatever. Listen, this guy is a major cocky prick, and that's why he never got the psychology of the game. If you want to pay someone for their girlfriend issues,give your friend your cash. Don't pay for this scumbag's therapy."
4,Strong and sturdy,"Right after having installed these, a co-worker made a comment about these ""meat grinders"" on my bike. I was warned. One slip of the pedals, and they spun around backwards, and Whack, hit my left shin. Had 9 new divots on my shin. The good news is that after that one time, I'm super careful and it hasn't happened since. Also, the ""gription"" of these pedals to my shoes is superb! I like them, just be warned; or wear shin-guards, heh heh..."
4,Great message although outdated in the presentation,"Was looking for a Nativity DVD to appeal to 3rd-5th graders - love that this uses real people rather than animated - it's very well presented if a little cheesy in the acting department. I was also looking for something modern - this not so much, but it's the best I could find. Stars Kirk Cameron circa 1990s? and goes between a ""modern"" family and the nativity story. I'm a little fearful the kids will be turned off by the obvious outdated clothing/hair etc. of the ""modern"" family - but the message is so good, the nativity story is well done for my target age group and it's well presented."
2,Easily Breakable,"I recieved this item from Amazon, it was packaged poorly and was broken. I informed amazon and returned item and had another one sent to my home. This item was also broken. I then just asked for my money back. Packaged poorly and easily breakable. D--"
3,Issue with Leaking,I like everything except the top where the chain attaches inside the feeder. Even with the rubber gasket that was included rain water runs down the chain into the bird feeder and ruins the bird feed. That was a bad design.
3,Super Telephoto Lens,"A rather hard unit to work with. I am using this on my Canon XSI camera and the depth of vision is very shallow and it is rather hard to take good looking pictures with it. Admittedly I am not a pro or even a semi pro photographer, but I have been taking pictures for a long time.The price was right so I went for it. I will probably end up selling it."
1,Not worth it's weight,"I am not saying this is a bad bad lens. But, the problem is about handling it. Too heavy and too long to any serious amateur, whereas this lens is claimed to be used for bird/wild life photography. NOT AT ALL FLEXIBLE.Quality of pictures is just about average. The only good thing you could do with this is, try lunar photography. With a lot of patience, you might get above-average-quality moon pix."
2,Get what you pay for only,This lens is decent for beginner experiments. I have a duplicate Russian lens that is more compact and easy to deal with. If this is all you can afford then my recommendation is to make sure you have one mamma jamma tripod for this because at far zoom it will be longer and tilting your tripod over. If you want to get into basic telephoto and learn the craft before spending the money this will work. Put your camera into aperture priority mode and off you go. I found that buying the wired remote and using the custom mirror lock gave much clearer images. Just the shutter mirror folding up at 1300mm causes blur. Assuming you have patience then you will have fun. Enjoy
4,Phoenix 650-2600mm Telephoto Lens,"This lens not bad for the money,Can't hand hold it. Its long and heavy, I found that it leaves halos around some of the images like ducks and eagles I have been taking photos of.Other wise it not a bad lens used with a tri-pod or mini pod. If you can't afford a canon hi end lens like i would of like this one not bad."
3,Good price but this thing is huge!,"Don't count on your average camera tripod handling this puppy. Weight aside, I would consider the optics a bit better than I had expected. Focus is a bit touchy at higher powers, but I would have guessed this also. Biggest issue I had was the Cannon Rebel I had initially, didn't have on-screen during focus. Had to use the camera view finder which made it a bit awkward since it's quite a ways away from the lens focus ring at full power. For the price, though, I consider it a real nice toy. One I won't use often, but have it when I want to mess with."
2,Cheap.,This lens is TOO BIG!! Hard to handle. The adapter broke going into my camera. The price is cheap and the parts are cheap. You get what you pay for...
3,Poorly Mastered - Go for the Set from Intrada Instead,"This is a powerful and often beautiful score, but the Silva Screen digital mastering is dull and lifeless, with dull sound. The new 2 disc set from Intrada has superb sound, more music, and extensive documentation."
3,Creepy music,"This soundtrack is perfect for a horror movie likeAlien. It's got a really creepy vibe, especially the tracks for the alien spaceship. I don't think it's as good a soundtrack to listen to on its own though. At times it's pretty jarring. Also, this version of theAlienCD is pretty expensive. It includes two discs, but much of it seems repetitive. I would rather have saved $10.In short, if you already have the movie soundtrack, it probably isn't worth getting this version just for the additional tracks."
3,Street Fighter Alpha: Definately No SF2!,"After seeing street fighter 2 the animated movie, and being entirely engrossed by an interesting and well thought out storyline, executed with the same axcellence, I had very high expectations of Alpha. The one big thing I wished for was contunity...after realising there was none after 10 minutes or so I hoped for at least a good storyline. To be honest the storyline is very very bland, and you wouldnt expect something so cheesy in a feature film of the Street Fighter Calibre. The animation is marvelous, but I definately prefer the ""rugged"" animation of SF2:Animated Movie...after not getting a good storyline, or continuity with SF2 (or even to an extent the SF series...e.g a MADE up ""baddie"" and some dissapointingly uninvolved appearances by the likes of Vega, Adon, Birdie etc...) I finally hoped that I would get a glimpse of Chun-Li in the flesh...It didnt happen... :-P"
4,good movie,"the movie is good, ...there arent many fight scenes, and the ones that are in the movie, arent all that great, but there are a couple of cool lookin moves/combos, plus ken has a really cool voice, and the screaming he does when he attacks ...but, i dont think this movie is all about fighting, i was more focusing on the plot. it wasnt all that great, but it was very well done. somehow it didnt feel like streetfighter sometimes, because of the doctor and that other big guy. this didnt bother me much though, it was both good and bad. it went pretty deep into ryu's struggle against the dark hadou and stuff, and i really liked the scene right before ryu and ken were goin to fight... get the movie, but if u want just fight scenes, akuma and bison, rent it... either way its worth watching"
4,Awsome but some bent scens,It was awsome if you keep up on Street Fighter and know the people well you would understand very good. Alough it spits out radom scens that make no cence ( this only happends a few times) the DVD ver is much better than the VHS one because it shows scens in the VHS 1 that almost proves that it was orginally made in Japan but in this 1 you will have no clue on it.
1,SUCK FIGHTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This redefined suck.(animation ok) After watching the fantastic Street Fighter 2 animated unrated version you expect continuity well you dont get it. Thats right no M Bison and the the way Chun li is mangeled was in bad taste. The music was just as bad as the film nothing like the carfully picked tracks of the original. The beatiful Intermix music for the M Bison intro scene is long gone and repalced with sounds of human flesh burning at least your ears and brain will be burning. Stay away from this garbage and watch NINJA SCROLL or the Original S FIGHTER!!!
2,"Missing time,and big holes","I had some high expectations waiting to see this movie.The plot makes no sense,the quote ""Big Brother"" got very iritating,very quick.I know it is a prequel to SF2,but come on!The animation was great up to a point,how many times must we see Chun Li's crotch and ass?Akuma may as well not have even been in the film.What the hell is up with Shun?..this little aggrevating kid did not need to be in this movie.A better story could really have been done.I love Street Fighter,but this was a poor excuse for a movie.The animation from SF2 The Animated Movie (Group Tac)was 100 times better than this one.I hope Capcom does something better than this one,..."
1,What a big disappointment,"What a big disappointment. I am a huge Street Fighter fan- of the game, the toys, the movies... but this has been the worst. The plot line is slapped together, the animation is surprisingly bad with bad edits and the fight sequences was just poorly done. They have Akuma for all of 5 min which is a huge bummer and nothing new is said about any of the characters. Do not buy- definately rent."
1,Can I return this?,"I just finished watching this movie. I couldn't stand it. There was no alpha storyline. Ryu didn't fight any other streetfighters from the game besides Ken. Birdie is like a good guy. The other streetfighter fights are terrible. This is not for a fan. Unless you're an all out Ryu mark. I left the room. Look I really had problems with this. I'm going to try and take it back tomorrow, but if they won't take I'll be selling it for 3 dollars. E-mail me."
1,a shameful one...,"a big dissapointment,can't understand how some mindless reviews say that this is a good one,the fights are boring,slow..the animation is plain,the plot is simply unintersting,where is akuma?? 3 minutes of his useless appearence in the movie didn't make a change!!!the rest of the other SF alpha characters did simply nothing except of posing for a few pictures to show off their muscles thank goodness i didn't buy...avoid this movie, trust me..."
3,not like the others,"hey if youre buying this movie hoping its like the sfv series or sf2 animaeted moivie you will be dissapointed. its a good movie, but it was more like akira than an action one. dont buy, rent."
2,"As a Street Fighter Movie, It Fails","I'm a huge Street Fighter fan and even a huge Street Fighter Alpha (the game, not the movie) fan. This movie made me feel bad for buying it. There was little to no action and a long pointless, uninteresting, and underdeveloped story. I think it could have been tweaked to become a better movie but this was not it. Grant it, I am writing this review from memory since it has been at least 4 years since I saw this. One of the most disappointing parts was the Akuma's presence in the movie. SPOILER ALERT: He was in it and everything but he wasn't even the final boss and if I remember correctly, he was defeated too easily. He played a haunting role more than a fighting role. If you're looking for a Street Fighter movie to add to your collection, then get Street Fighter: The Animated Movie or just get an old Sonny Chiba Street Fighter (non-animated and having nothing to do with the video game) movie."
2,Only have it as a Fan,The only reason I still have this is because Im a Street Fighter fan. But this film is still atrotious! No M. Bison (Vega to those japanese fans) Akuma (Gouki) only appers for five minutes and we have to central characters WHO ARE NOT EVEN STREET FIGHTER CHARACTERS! This film and it's even worse sequal Alpha Generations make me want to bang my head in to a wall. Manga Video should not make anymore Street Fighter animes if they're going to continue to mess them up. Stick to SF 2 the movie & SF II V. those are the good ones.
4,Street Fighter Alpha - The Movie,"This movie was good, way better than the series as far as the story line goes. Anime is great."
2,the action scene are pretty nice,"as opposed to he original street fighter movie which featured a ridilucuous plot and dated by vibrant animation Alpha makes some visual improbments. the chrachter designs are more proportional and more appealing then SF:M and the fight scenes are certianly better, but the plot and the whole feel is an after thought. rushed and uneven it simply adds up beyond eye candy"
4,Don't be so hard on it!,"Come down people,the best of Street Fighter Alpha is still to come.Althougt this movie wasn't what you really were expecting it is just the beginning of what will be a great anime serie.Give S.F.A.(S.F.Z.)one more chance and it would show you how great it is.I know the plot wasn't quit clear but the characters were just perfect.It introducced us a new generation of SF,a whole new plot and a new beginning.Even though this anime wasn't the best of all it sure has it action scenes that are a total blast.If you just want to try it,rent it but if you really are a SF fan this movie is one for you to keep."
3,Disappointing,"In this review I will discuss this movie's good and bad points. First, some of the new characters like Sakura, Rose, and Birdie were in the movie briefly but in a meaningful way. Secondly, the dubbing was very good. The scenes with Sakura in them were very cute and humorous, even Ryu's alleged brother Shun had some adorable moments. The fact that this is a Street Fighter movie I expected the fight scenes to be equal to or better than the fight scenes in the previous SF movie or television series, but unfortunately the fight scenes aren't that great. Also, I was a little upset that some of the other Alpha characters who appear in the movie had roles that were short-lived and corny. The story wasn't fully realized by the writer's in my opinion, because it had the potential for being so much more than a story fit for a Saturday morning cartoon show. The characters were also in many cases repeating the same tired lines over and over again which was very annoying."
2,Terrible excuse for a SF movie,"This movie was extremely hyped up. This was an extremely big disappointment.It was disappointing for these reasons:1. The movie did not follow the storyline to the Alpha series, and not enough characters were in the movie.2. The new characters should not have been included in the first place(i.e Shun!!!)3. The plot was too childish. What I mean is that Manga and Capcom should have just marketed this to kids, and removed the blood."
3,Nothing new really,"I wanted to like this, I really did. I've been a huge Street Fighter fan since SF2 came out about a decade ago. This movie just didn't seem to have either the intensity of fights or even the beautiful animation of the first one. Some parts seemed to computer generated and not hand drawn. It added some facts to the Street Fighter series, but it deviated enough from the plot that you can't actually take it as truth, especially Ryu's family. Just not as good as the original animated movie (though at least this one had a Japanese track), and even though it tried for a story, I think Fatal Fury still has the best for a video game anime. A good rent for all Street Fighter fans, but unless you're a fanatic like me, you probably should try it before you buy it."
2,Not horrible....,"Honestly it doesn't even come with in sniffing distance of the original cartoon film...total lack of a real plot...They focus way to much on Ryu and lack development for any of the other characters...The animation is great, but the fight scenes are uninspired"
1,"if u liked SF2 the animated movie, then you will hate this","SFA the movie is a hard to watch anime movie. It is horrible, it has nothing to do with storylines from the games and the characters in the movie get off character completly; especially Zangief who is totally off charcter.Akuma is featured on the cover but he he's barely in the movie, there isn't even one fight scene with Akuma... rip off.The hole story line with Ryu's fake borther Shun is really anoying ""big brother, big brother"".Then when you think you will see interesting scenes with Adon, Birdie, Guy and Sodom... you get robbed insted with a bad story and plot and one of the worst villains.The movie has nothing to do with the SFA games... keep away"
1,Dissapointing...,"As an otacu,Street Fighter is one of my all-time favorites. Street Fighter 2: the animated movie is one of the best animes I have in my collection. So you can guess how anxious I was to watch this one. Unfortunately,it wasn't at all what I expected. There were no real fighting scenes that would really amaze anyone,the characters were poorly drawn,the plot seemed too shallow for what it wanted to present and it was missing key characters from the games. It doesn't even have a fight scene with Akuma!! I mean, common now! That is what most people who know SFA expect. The only element that I consider to be good was how they emphasized on the dark side trying to consume Ryu. I merely reccomend you to rent this."
4,Looking for a name?,"Although this is an excellent and comprehensive source of names of Western culture, I was dissapointed to find that it lacked names that were Asian in origin--specically Chinese and Japanese. I'm not knocking the book--it is still a very good name resource--I'm just warning you if you were hoping to find names from all cultures."
5,Never start writing without it,"I bought the Character Naming Sourcebook years ago and I have never regretted it. The layout makes finding what I need easy. It resides beside my computer and is never out of reach.It's a shame this book is no longer in print. I have one or two other name books (nothing as good as this one) but they may be of interest. The first is called The Name Book by Dorothy Astoria--There is some good stuff in this, and the little quote with each name is a nice touch. The second is presumptuously called The Only Baby Name Book You'll Ever Need and is by Heidi Overhill. This one includes with each entry the names and dates of birth of famous people named for that entry."
5,The Writer's Digest Character Naming Sourcebook by Sherrilyn Kenyon,This book is extremely comprehensive and excellent for seasoned and aspiring writers. The listing by `cultures' is extremely helpful for reference by what writers are actually writing about. It tells you where the names came from and their meanings making choosing a name all that much more fun and appealing.AND you could also use it for potential baby names!
2,Trust with extreme Caution!,"I checked this book out from the library to see what some of the other reviewers meant about inaccuracies before I would purchase the book. From the ""Algonquin"" perspective there are inaccuracies as well. I don't know the Algonquin for all the names mentioned in this book, but the name for brother the book lists as ""Wematin"" isn't right. I've personally read at least a couple dozen books about the Algonquin in the early 1600s and those books used these words:niwikanis - brothermawchick chammay - the best of friendsnetoppew -Friends"
2,Not worth the time or money,"Meh. Not worth it. The advice was really generic and the lists are not very extensive or very useful, in my opinion. Plus, in contemporary times, names get out of date so fast (you can often tell by a person's name what decade they were probably born in) that a book would quickly become obsolete. If you want help naming your fictional characters you'd be better off looking at a few baby name books that talk about context as well as meaning; Linda Rosencrantz and Pamela Redmond Satran's books are the best ones for that. Most importantly, use the internet to look up names. That's the best source."
4,RPG nuts will be very happy,"I play Role-Playing Games extensively and this is the one character making aid my role-playing buddies drool over. Need a name for a telepathic half-orc assassin? Skim through some of the more exotic sections and you're sure to find something.I also enjoy writing fantasy and this book can be a great help in that department as well. I am no expert and would not depend on it exclusively for a modern novel but for fantasy names it is invaluable.This combined with a good baby name book can make an RPG gamers life easier, especially when they are faced with the daunting task of naming a Venusian ship captain with flashbacks and snakes for hair.One complaint. Utter lack of Oriental names, there are all of two that are listed in every baby name book. Other than that, one fun book."
5,Great!,"Hi!This Book is simply great and I am so grateful that I got the chance to get it from amazon.com for in Germany there is no way I could have gotten it for a decent price.The names are ordered in ""Asian"" or ""arthurian Legend"" or such and thus simply great to search in for authors. Thanks again for the great work, Mrs. Kenyon!"
5,One of the All-Time Greats!!,"I wish I could thank Sherrilyn Kenyon for writing this book. It was a long time coming and I can't tell you how much this book has helped me. I do a lot of historical writing & this book has been a lifesaver to me more times than I can count. I use this book at every workshop I teach & if you need help with names, and let's face it who doesn't, this is the best book you'll ever own!"
3,Ozawa and Pletnev are bland and refined -- but the Nutcracker is great,"This is a frustrating box set of Tchaikovsky ballets. There's no arguing against the good recorded sound, which captures the elegance of the BSO and the refinement of the Russian Naitonal Orchestra. Both ensembles play very well, so there's no arguing about the pleasure of hearing such perfect execution. But Ozawa and Pletnev both view these scores as models of correctnoess and poise. Perhaps they view ballet that way, too, but absent more passion and real heart, all three performances become debilitating after a while -- all that poise drains away the music's life blood. However, for long stretches Ozawa's Nutcracker is vigorous and engrossing -- it's the best thing here and worth seeking out on the used markety by itself.By a slight margin I prefer this box set to the corresponding one on EMI from Previn, but you are better off finding separate versions of each score."
2,Didn't last 10 minutes,"This is such a cute idea, and it is a good size and very colorful. Soft and alot of fun.............FOR ALL OF TEN MINUTES. My 7 month old dobie had the left ear off and was pulling out the stuffing in just ten minutes.Not a good toy for large breed pups."
5,Two films,"My Dad appreciated this DVD, which in fact is composed of two different parts, each of them absolutely interesting when you look for more information about the Station!Thank you for this great idea!"
1,Elvis,"This author indeed has problems of his own. He has anger issues in which he needs to address. Therapy would be quite helpful for this author.It was impossible to find anything credible in what he wrote because it was so obvious the contempt he had for his subject.I understand that one of Elvis' so called friends, Lamar Fike, was one of Goldman's references, with friends like Fike no wonder Elvis was plagued with so many problems. If only Elvis had not trusted people like Fike maybe this entire scenario might have been different for Mr. Presley.In spite of this trashy novel Elvis lives on in the hearts of his legion of fans and continues to gain more fans all the time. His legacy will go on forever whereas people like Goldman and Fike will cease to even be a footnote."
1,GREAT LIES IF YOU HATE ELVIS!,"THE PAGES OF THIS BOOK ARE NOT WORTH LINING A LITTERBOX.THE ""EXPERTS"" SUPPOSEDLY INTERVIEWED FOR THIS RAG,WERE NO MORE THAN A HANDFULL OF DISGRUNTLED,FAT,BALD,ANDLEFT -OUT -OF- THE- WILL EX-EMPLOYEES.GOLDMAN DESPISED ELVIS AND POPULAR MUSIC IN GENERAL,MOREOF A BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO STILL ARE JEALOUS OF HEARING OFPRESLEY'S SUCCESS AND TALENT.ONLY WORTH ONE STAR AS AUTHOR IS NOW DUST!"
3,"Not his best, but still pretty good.","Simply put, The Horse Tamer is an account of Henry Daily's younger days, working with his older brother for a cirus. As the title denotes, Henry tames wild horses, instead of breaking them. Along with an insight into Henry's past, the book also provides excitement as it reveals a sinister plot unfolding. The Horse Tamer was a good book; while not GREAT, it still offered excitement and made me keep turning the pages. I liked this book because it was written by Walter Farley, and I like his stuff. Also, the plot was interesting, and it gave me a background on Henry Daily. It was also a fresh change of pace from all the books about Alec Ramsey. Overall, I'd say read it. Although it's not Walter Farley's best book ever, it's still good enough to warrant a reading."
4,An enchanting prequel of the black stallion,I loved this book. I think about it on trail rides when I'm riding the stallion my friend owns and whenever I ride young horses. This book has a very clear message at the end : Those who are wild at heart will remain wild forevermore.I reccomend this book to all horse lovers who enjoy reading exciting books that will put you in the edge of your seat!
4,Locked In? Want to Be Free? Read on.,"Many in our ""free"" country are not free from emotional pain from the past. They are not free to act and react in ways they choose, as if an unseen grip kept them locked in patterns of behavior that are self-defeating.Such a person is the main character of ""When the Heart Soars Free."" Jerry truly wants to live responsibly but unseen forces smother his best intentions. How he finds help and what he discovers about his self-defeating actions makes this book a must read. I'm ready for the sequel!"
5,A reader from the mountains of Virginia,"I am an avid reader of Christian fiction. I found ""When the Heart Soars Free"" refreshingly different as it deals with heart issues that are common to many of us. The salvation message is clearly presented as are ways of breaking free from emotional issues which can keep us defeated. I highly recommend ""When the Heart Soars Free""."
5,Outstanding Book,"Every Civil War enthusiast should have this book. It's beautiful, enjoyable, as well as educational. Troiani's attention to detail and historical accuracy is astounding. Most of Troiani's work is of active battle scenes with anonomous characters, unlike John Paul Strain's work which focuses on specific leaders in non-battle situations. I recommend both books."
2,I don't know,This is a good book if you have ALLOT of time on your hands. It has allot of traditional recipes using traditional ingredients. There are know short cuts. Most meals here take an hour or longer to create. I highly recommend .Puerto Rican Cuisine in America: Nuyorican and Bodega Recipes
2,?Que esto?,"When I read the other reviews I thought this was the book I was looking for, when it arrived I was so excited. Then I started looking for the dishes that I wanted to make and I didn't find them. So, I tried to make what was in the book. Can I tell you that I've never heard of sour orange juice??? One receipe said to carmelize sugar in a pan...should that be on the stove or in the oven (Carmelizing is hard as hell if you don't know what you are doing). No details about consistency, or substitutes that could be used or other info that would have been very helpful. They need to revise this joint. Tank ju berry mush."
2,Deep-fried,"This book is an interesting collection of Puerto Rican recipes. Local traditions are present in the numerous recipes for plantains, coconuts, guava, and rum. However, a health-food cookbook, this is not. A great number of the recipes call for deep-frying. Processed foods such as canned vegetables, instant potatoes, and Valveeta are also prominent. One could enjoy a few dishes from this book every once in a while as a treat, but this is not a book to live out of."
2,Okay,"First let me start by saying that I am ethnic myself and cook many different types of foods. This book was okay, I have purchased better books with more interesting and flavorful recipes."
1,Monotonous Regularity,"Never have I enjoyed a cookbook less than this contrived concoction of unappetizing recipes. Can you believe a Puerto Rican cookbook without reference to annatto, that aromatic red/orange seed so prevalent in PR cuisine? And only one recipe for asopao, a dish indigenous to the island boasting so many luscious variations.It became a joke after realizing one recipe looked very much like the rest. I returned this book as quickly as I was able.Chef JamesMaui"
4,Tastes just like my moms' home cookin (but don't tell her).,To sum it up my husband no longer complains about my home cooked meals anymore. Its tough living up to the cooking standards of both a Puerto Rican mother and mother-in-law but now they both want to borrow my cook book. My apron off to Carmen Aboy Valldejul!
5,Puerto Rican Cookery,"This book was purchased for my daughter Robin in N.Y.. She comes from a very Puerto Rican home and loves to cook. The minute she received it, she selected several dishes she wants to prepare. I am very proud of my heritage and have proudly instilled my knowledge of P.R. cooking to each of my three daughters. Thank you for the opportunity to share this with them. Boricua hasta el fin!!! Judith Rodriguez."
5,Cocina Criolla in English!,"I had seen this book years back & wondered how to find it again. Couldn't have been luckier to find this seller with an apparently new book for half the price of the brand-new book! Arrived quickly, in great condition & I paid a song for it! Definitely will use this site again & buy more books by this author!"
4,orange gloves=warm hands,"warm dry hands, used in Alaska to keep hands warm and dry, while running rivers. Have purchased a pair for everyone in my family."
5,winter gardening solution,"These gloves make it possible for me to garden in the winter. They are waterproof and lined in fake fur and keep my hands oh-so-toasty, yet they allow me the sensitivity to pull the tiniest weed with ease."
4,Keep you dry...and fairly warm,"I actually got these locally at a farm supply store where they are very popular with diary farmers in my area. They work fine and are a good alternative to expensive ski gloves. I really don't think they'll cut it in 0 deg or below weather, without liners of some sort. And speaking of liners, I went to put them on today after using them yesterday for about an hour session of blowing snow and they're very moist inside from sweat. Guess it was too warm yesterday at 20deg. I have them standing up by the woodstove to dry out the insides. No biggie."
4,Flexible and warm no matter how cold,"great gloves for snowblowing, AND washing the car on a cold day.Comfortable and warm, they never get hard or feel brittle. Actually needed to take them off as my hands began to sweat!"
4,A must buy for any fan of Pearl Jam and Neil Young,"Cross someone who sounds kinda like Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam with a band that sounds a lot like a cross between Pearl Jam and Neil Young's Crazy Horse and you get bluesy rawk'n'roll with poetic downbeat lyrics that will move your mind to the last outpost of artistic freedom of expression. As everyone says, this stuff should be more popular than it is. This is the real deal. The longer the song, the better it is. My favorite tracks: Such Pretty Eyes For A Snake and Almost Was Good Enough. Love the lonesome Mexican trumpet in Leave The City too."
5,Jason Groth really makes this group better,Jason's awesome guitar playing makes this cd a must have.
4,Great Value for the Price,"I've had this this same hair setter for quite sometime and am still very pleased with it. It heats up quickly. The flocked rollers are great. I don't care for the clips, but they are typical u-shaped hot roller clips. Definitely worth the money!"
3,Okay,"A little more academicky for my tastes. I like to read Hazrat Khan. I feel Shah's writing is a bit stiff, whereas Khan's writing flows evenly from concept to concept."
3,Semi Appealing,"An excerpt from this book was read at a college campus event I attended. I liked the excerpt and decided to pick up a copy. I only found a handful of other ""useful"" pieces to this book. Though my over all impression was a little disapponited."
5,An exellent book on the Sufi Wisdom,"The book provides a good collection of sufi sayings - the words of wisdom - e.g.------The Answer ---We wrote a hundred letters, and you did not write an answer. This, too, is a reply.--- Zauqi---------Remedy------Your medicine is in you, and you do not observe it.Your ailment is from yourself, and you do not register it.-----Hazrat Ali--------- The State ----Justice and fairness, not religion or atheism,Are needful for the protection of the State.------Hakim Jami------ The Science -------The Science of Truth disappers in the Sufi's knowledge.When will mankind understand this saying?----Jalaludin Rumi"
5,A basic introductory course in Sufi study,"The Way Of The Sufi is an anthology of material from Sufi Schools, teachings, and classical writings, intended as a basic introductory course in Sufi study. Author Idries Shah, well-known for expounding upon Sufi ideas and his work to make Sufi teachings accessible to a Western audience, presents contemporary readers with both outward aspects of Sufi thought and evidence that Sufi principles were absorbed into medieval Christianity, Hinduism, Jewish mysticism, and modern philosophical teachings. A very welcome and timely contribution to Religious Studies collections and reading lists, Idries Shah's The Way Of The Sufi not only focuses upon what Sufi is, but also the role Sufi activity and practice has to play in the modern the world."
5,THE BEST BASSIST IN THE WORLD BY FAR,"Abraham's name appears in hundreds and hundreds of albums from all kinds of musics, Jazz, Funk, Rock, Gospel, Instrumentals, R&B, Disco etc. etc. and that's exactly what you get in this album, pure quality, variety and super skills; It's unfortunate to read reviews like the one posted here by someone who does not understand a great artist's work and probably expected a milkshake. Abraham as well as his long-time partners Justo Almario and Alex Acuña are top-notch instrumentalists. Please do yourself a favor and purchase this CD, you'll be glad you did."
5,3 Great Workouts!,These 3 workouts are fantastic. Each one contains 2 workouts each totalling 6. I am very happy with this purchase and have been using them daily. I can tell a difference...I'm getting much more toned. They are challenging and make you feel very proud when you have completed them!
2,Later Model - MBTS4SR,"My husband and I both loved the bubbling action and the massagers for the neck and feet, however the noise level is so loud that it cannot possibly be relaxing! It sounds like two vaccum cleaner motors going at the same time. I thought we could unwind for the day with candles and music and the bubbling tub, however you could never, ever possibly hear any music with that loud noisy motor running. It would be such an absolutely perfect product IF you could make the motor quiet. Otherwise it works in reverse--- you come out of the tub with your muscles feeling wonderful but you are so agitated from the noise that you need to find some other way to unwind from the so called ""soothing"" bath. My advice is to save your money until they come up with a way to take the noise away!! I was extremely disappointed in the product!"
3,Later model,I just purchased the Conair thermal spa bath matmodel MBTS4SR.It does make a lot of bubbles butalso a lot of noise.This model comes with a neckmassager but You have to push Your neck against itfor the massager to come on. this is hardlyrelaxing.Otherwise it seems to work ok.
2,Tiny Monitor,"I definitely am a huge fan of video game for my Nintendo Gamecube. Nevertheles, I also do know when a additional accessory can be a absolutely big waste of money. That has been the case with this small and portable monitor for the Nintendo Gamecube. The device happens to be convient add-on, but it really isn't worth the money that it is made out to be. Although it would be great if you were playing the Gamecube during a road trip, but to be honest with you, it isn't worth the money it is made out to be. Instead, I honestly would rather place my Gamecube into my home, and connect it to my television.Price: D-Monitor: C-Convience: D-Overall: D 1/2-"
5,where can i get one of these things,"OK, I read all of the reviews now I just want to know where I can get one.Please respond with another review"
5,This thing is great.,This is a great Monitor. It comes with all the items you need for cube fun in the car or at home. A slight side affect in the car is a barley audible humming noise when the monitor is in use. This moniter works great w/ a DVD player also. I would perfer this over the moniter on the DVD player itself anyday.
4,Great Product,"I recently bought the 5"" Game Screen and have loved evry minute of it. It has crisp colors, bright lighting, and good sound. The only things I didn't like were that when i tried using headphones with it, there was a background buzz. Also, I had to return one because of small, but visible splotches on the screen. But the second one I bought was great."
4,DONT BUY IT!,"This Gamecube Screen Was Sweet!...For 4 months, at least. After four months, the A/V cables refused to pick up and display anything unless I jiggled them around. After that, the screen would either play the sounds or show the game on the screen, but never both. Don't buy it unless the problem gets fixed."
5,Awesome,I recently purchased this screen and it is the best thing every made for gamecube. Buy it. If you dont you will be sorry
3,Everything is great but SOUND!!!,"I personally liked the screen a lot except for one small problem, whenever it was on it made a constant loud BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ noise!!!! The noise could not be drained out even when the volume is on full blast, which is pretty loud. No matter what I do, I always hear buzzing!!!!! I sent the screen back, got another one and the same thing happened!! I got so frustrated that I got a different screen that doesn't buzz. Overall the graphics 5/5, Portability 5/5, Everything but sound 5/5. DO NOT GET THIS SCREEN UNLESS YOU WANT TO HEAR A CONSTANT, ANNOYING, LOUD BUZZING NOISE."
4,No color adjustments,"Everything is ok but the fact that you can't adjust the color, only brightness. Color too saturated. Horrible for the eyes."
4,A piece of nostalgia,"I had this book as a child. It had at the end a tear-out page that was a ""pledge"" to keep traffic rules and keep your bicycle in good repair, to be signed by the kid and by his parents (""or guardian"").The story is about one child whose bicycle runs away from him to join all the other bikes that were escaping their disrespectful and unsafe owners. I still have that pledge page in an old (very old) photo album. I am going to get a copy for my kids to read."
5,Vicki Vann has a definite Country Music Future!,"Vicki Vann is well on her way to making it big in the Country Music Scene. Her songs are pure country, and her voice is one that fits country 100%. To be her first album ever you'd be extremely surprised at how great an album this is. I will sing my song is probably the best song on the album, and it showcases her potential, which is HUGE. Put your money on Vicki Vann, cause I'm sure she will be around for a long time."
5,Awesome Christmas music,"If you're a jazz lover, David Benoits ""Christmastime"" is the absolute best. He makes the piano sing with the very best jazz renditions of classic Christmas music. This is delicious ""ear candy."" One of my ""friends"" was kind enough to lift my album from me. And it took 2 years of surfing to finally locate another copy of this CD. This is one of my favorite holiday CDs. Sadly, it's very hard to locate copies of this classic. I believe it's out of production."
5,Share the Spirit of the City,My niece is enthralled with the fact that I live in NYC and this book was a perfect way to share the spirit of the city that I love. I've bought a copy of this picturesque take on urban A B Cs for both kids and adults. It's so beautiful I want to frame each page...
5,Awesome NYC,Whether you're from NYC or not your tot will love learning their ABCs through images from the greatest city on earth!
5,ABC NYC,"This is a lovely book for city children who don't understand that 'c' is for 'cow'. ""C"" is for Chrysler building. I have given this book to several children, New Yorkers and ex-New Yorkers. They all like 'b' is for 'bagel'."
5,A classic book: for NYC what Make Way For Ducklings was for Boston.,"I live in NYC and bought these books for my nieces who live in Texas when they came to visit.They utterly loved them. They picked out things in the book and found them on the streets and can not stop talking about the things they saw and learned in the books: watertowers, manhole covers.This is a beautiful and classic book about New York. And I think it really changes the way a child will look at any city. I've bought this for all of the children in my life- those who live in NYC and outside NYC and both they and their parents constantly tell me how the book has become part of their child's thoughts and life.Which NYC would you rather a child know? Eloise's? Or this- this populist, loving, beautifully observed way to love and involve yourself in NYC in a child's way that adults love too.Also love 123 NYC."
4,interesting book,"i didnt expect this book to have such a story line, but it was a very intersting read. it only took 2 days to read it because i couldnt put it down."
1,"Beset by errors, give this a miss","Almost without merit, this is a familar reheat of Creationist dogma, containing such a host of inaccuracies as to be risible. Avoid at all costs."
1,poorly made !!!!!,"i wanted this bag cause i carrie a lot of stuff, but the first time used it the little strap broke clean off! and i almost lost all my things.then the next time i put the big straps on i knew i was gud then. i put the bag across my body the next thing i know i'm being paged at walmart cause the straps broke agin and the security person found my bag the fake leather is so thin and cheep my keys poked a hole on the bag i wish i had my money back but you get what you pay for!!!! And I Only Used Thid Bag 4times dont waste your money!!!"
3,Wallet/Handbag Review,"This is a well-made, sturdy product but heavier than I like (maybe eliminate the cardboard bulk that makes it heavier). I would prefer the zipper to be reversed in order to gain easy access to my credit cards. It's awkward to reach below the purse in order to zip upwards to get to credit cards and you run the risk of dumping some of the contents when the bag is upside down. Also, the cell-phone compartment could be shorter - I have a small phone and it's difficult to remove it quickly when someone calls.I also wish there had been better and more pictures and descriptions of the compartments and zippers that are available.A nice purse but not suited for me."
4,just a battery,Item was received in good time and shape. Not much to say about a little phone battery.
2,Sent me the wrong battery,Sent me the wrong battery which is for Tero 680 instead of for Tero 650.I give it away to my friend.
4,good tunes,"A good collection of songs from the 50's and 60's, great for people who were around then. CD in excellent condition."
5,Great To Find This Again!,"I grew up using my moms copy that she got from SF Chinatown. What a find to see it here online and have it shipped right to my house.This is a CLASSIC book to have. Some of the recipes need tweaking (I've been trying to master the green onion pancake recipe for years from all kinds of sources, this being my first one), but there are some real winners. The Chinese Steam Cake ""Mah Lay Goh"" recipe is the BEST i've ever had and can't be found online. The cake is light, moist, and almost savory when you slap some butter on it right out of the steamer. Lots of great basics, a must have if you like chinese dim sum."
1,Annoying brush,"I was expecting something else, I guess. It vibrates annoyingly and gives me no sense of relaxation whatsoever."
5,Massage Brush hair growth Stimulator,I bought 72 of these massage brushes to sell with my hair growth product. The massage brush really helps to bring blood to the follicle and hair papilla making your hair grow faster and healthier. I give one of these brushes away with my hair growth product Rouse Guaranteed Hair Growth System when a person buys a 3-month supply of the Rouse Hair Growth System. We really love the brushes and recommend them to everyone. I hope this helps in your review of this item.
2,Quality,The first time I purchased the item it broke instantly however I contacted the seller and was a rushed a second brush at no charge. The brush does give you a good massage. I like that it can fit in small compartments. I have noticed my hair has grown and it does appear healthier. The second brush I received cracked but it still works. The red beads have fallen off. The bumps on the opposite side of the bristles are really good for a massage. I would say the brush is a little on the cheap side and needs to be improved.
1,bad design,"you twist the handle to turn it on. very poor design,if you arent careful you can damaage it by twisting it a little too much . mine broke when i first used it. get the NON-waterproof brush instead, its alot more durable and it doesnt turn on using that twisting motion. so its alot less likely to break."
4,"close, but....","K-Os is unbelievably talented. There is no single bad song in Joyful rebellion. There are straight up hip hop songs and soulful ballads like ""superstar"". This album is lyrically and musically perfect but the problem is that it has no real depth. I feel like all the songs could be about anything. He lyrically and musically surpasses Mos Def but his words are pop song words and don't have the depth of true hip hop liek Mos Def has. Still, overall, I think this is an album you have to have. I also think we can expect better from K-Os in the future. Oh, and by the way, for all the reviewers comparing K-Os to Wyclef: K-Os makes Wyclef look like a nursery school rapper."
4,WYCLEF MEETS JAZZY FUNKY HIP HOP,"IT'S COOL , I LIKE WHAT HE'S REPRESTING...REAL HIP HOP,THE TRACKS ARE FAT & THE LYRICS HIT. THE ONLY REASON FOR 4 STARSIS THAT HE SINGS TOO MUCH FOR MY TASTE OF HIP HOP.GIVE IT TO ME RAW BABY"
1,EHHH!,"Kheav could have done better. Of course, the first cd, through and through was a classic banger. This album is more.... how shall I say.... Tracey Chapman-ish-it. OOOPS, didn't mean to cuss. Beats were ok on some songs but the rest was flat. Want something raw, underground music? Check out Immortal Technique. This brotha is walking around with a full clip and a bullet proof vest."
1,Horrible&Corny,"you ain't gonna dis Michael Jackson with a sorry song like ""Man I use to be"" what kind of mess is that?? this Cat is a Karoke Wyclef Jean Meets Will I Am.His music is Boring&Nothing about his voice is worth remembering.this Cat's Music is like a Reject Musical Youth Project that stayed on the cutting room floor."
3,Replacement chainsaw chain,"I received the requested chain for my chainsaw in a reasonable amount of time. Shipping charges were rather extreme. Would probably not buy if I had to do this all over again. Replacement came in an unsealed box. Normally chains are oiled and sealed in plastic to prevent rust. This one was not - just stuck in an unsealed box. I expect I got one that had been opened and returned. It cuts ok - the important thing, but in the future I will probably buy one that I can check first."
1,Don't buy this coffee maker!,"I experienced the same problem consecutively with two of these coffee makers purchased from different suppliers. I poured in the water and it ran directly out the bottom. I cannot review whether it makes good coffee or not because both machines I purchased ...had the same problem. I contacted Krups by phone and they told me I had to take the unit in to a service center but the nearest one is 100 miles away. If this was a quality machine, this problem should not exist."
2,Glass is better than Stainless for hot coffee.,"I have had both the glass lined carafe which is great for keeping the coffee hot and the stainless which is more durable, but does not keep as long. Love the convenience of setting the coffee to brew at night and waking up the next morning to a fresh pot without the wait.While Amazon may have the $ rebate. Krups is notorious for denying the rebate, look elsewhere if you are relying on the 20 dollars back. You probably will not get it. I have done many hundreds of offers and Krups is the only one I did not get back."
1,worst kitchen purchase I ever made - coffee doesn't stay hot,"This coffee maker doesn't deliver on its promises!! Though the coffee is good right after it is made -- that's something any coffee maker can do -- it DOESN'T STAY HOT AT ALL. We even went so far as to fill the thermal caraffe with very hot water and let it sit for several minutes to heat up the interior. IT STILL DIDN'T KEEP IT HOT!!We purchased this at a department store and threw away the box after we thought it was OK -- what a big mistake. Now we're stuck with an ... coffee pot that gives you cold coffee and we can't return it, like some lucky reviewers did.DO NOT buy this coffee pot -- it'll be a very ... mistake if you do!"
4,A Winner,"I have just received and begun to use the Krups thermal coffee maker. For the past two years I have used a Starbucks Barista Aroma coffee maker - also a thermal unit - the price of which was about $X as I recall.The Krups unit is better in all respects. The unit makes 10 cups of coffee rather than 8 - wished I'd had it before the holidays as we had lots of guests. The unit looks better than the starbucks, and the fit, feel, and operation of the unit are all smoother - for less money. The coffee is great - for less money!!"
1,Zero stars,"I can not stand this coffee maker. There are always grounds in the coffee. The coffee started tasting like swamp water. One day when I overfilled the reservoir, while pouring out the extra I found grounds coming out of the water dispenser. The filter must fill with so much water while brewing that it backs up into the water dispenser. I will not even give it to the local thrift shop,it goes in the trash."
2,Carafe exploded,I received this coffee maker 7 months ago as a gift and today the glass on the inside of the carafe exploded while the coffee was brewing. We had done nothing different than normal. We took very good care of the carafe (didn't wash it in the dishwasher or handle it roughly). We do make a lot of coffee so maybe it was just normal wear and tear! I called Krups and because I had a record on my Amazon wish list that someone had purchased this coffee maker as a gift for us they are immediately resending us a new one. The customer service rep was very friendly.
1,Really weak coffee,I like strong coffee and have had to increase ground use by at least a third to achieve the strength needed. Because use expensive beans this is a real problem. I am looking for another model today.
1,a disappointment,"I am a student and on a budget. I am also a connoisseur of sorts when it comes to coffee. I bought this from a local store relying on the good name and thermal pot, assuming that i could brew coffee at midnight and have hot joe for the whole night. Well, I had lukewarm (at best) coffee after brewing and almost cold coffee a few hours later. The apparatus beneath the filter is terrible, and often clogs, resulting in a dangerous puddle of grinds and brown liquid under the coffee maker, putting my life at risk for a simple cup of coffee to stay up, frantically studying coursepacks for exams to come. Pass this one up."
1,Disappointed,"I have owned my Krups coffee maker for a year and a half and now it will not shut off. I contacted the customer service department and basically got told, ""so what....beyond warranty"". I expected so much more than what I got. I would get better service from a Mr. Coffee product I purchase at Wal- Mart! Which by the way,I gave away my 15 yr. old Mr. Coffee maker that still worked when I received my new Krups. I expected more from Krups.... I guess I was wrong."
1,Looks cool but does not work,"I got one of these for xmas this year and was pretty excited about getting it. I had done a bunch of research before asking for this particular model. I STILL can't find many bad reveiews of this thing and I don't get it. The one I got leaked ALL of the water I put into the resevoir onto the counter. I took it back to the chain where it was purchased but in another state from where it was originally bought. I got home with the brand new one, plugged it in, and filled it up with water just to see if it did the same thing. Sure enough, it leaked in exactly the same way all over the counter. What a hassle and a letdown."
2,Coffemaker Blues!,"I searched for a couple of months for a coffemaker that would do everything I wanted it to do. I hoped this would be the one. Nope. The coffee tastes very weak. Perhaps they should have not designed the ""aroma control"" feature. It controls it alright, no aroma at all! I miss the smell of fresh-brewed coffee that helps get me out of bed in the morning. I still haven't figured how much more beans I will need to make it strong enough. I guess I won't give my old West Bend away just yet. If there is a maker out there that will:1. Make at least 10 cups and still use a thermal carafe.2. Must be programmable.3. Steep strong coffee.4. Color available in black.5. Doesn't have a ""gold filter""Please let me know! I should have checked the other reviews just before buying this one."
1,Cold Coffee,"This has to be the worst coffee maker around. You have to drink you coffee AS soon as it is brewed. If you wait even a couple of minutes, it'll be too cold to drink. If you add milk to your coffee, then you might as well add some ice cubes and drink an ICED Coffee, since it'll be like drinking cold milk anyway.Oh, the coffee does taste good (the first cup thats luke warm).You'll make some executive at Krups very happy if you buy this machine, since someone should lose their job over such a poorly made device."
3,There are better for the price,"There are a lot of things about this coffee maker that I didn't like. One, which seems to be the most popular here, is that the coffee doesn't stay hot. The other thing I don't like is that after a couple of weeks, my thermal carafe broke while the coffee was brewing. It would be nice to know a little about thermal carafes, especially cleaning them, but Krups doesn't provide adequate information other than ""Don't use harsh chemicals."" Well, there's a no-brainer.What I do like is the size of the unit; it's small and takes up little counter space. I like how easy it is to set the time and the auto-timer. It's exceptionally easy to clean. It doesn't get overly hot so you can clean and set up for the next morning right away. And it does brew quickly so if you run out of coffee during a dinner party, you can quickly make more.This is a good second coffee maker. I use it when my Hamilton Beach Brew Station bites it."
3,"Good Coffee, Breakable Thermal Carafe","Yes, the coffee was good, we had a gold filter left over from the last Krups pot, and were particularly interested in the thermal carafe. After 1 week of use, the carafe inexplicably broke when the top was screwed down. Guess that I will go back to the Melitta carafe and the tea kettle version, as that has not broken in over 20 years -- just not as convenient. I don't suppose that Krups, already with a backlog of orders for the replacement carafe will take responsibility for this one that may have been a customer's fault, i.e., they dropped it. We did not."
3,Okay,We have had this coffee maker for a few years but have had some problems.1. the rubber piece inside the basket had to be turned upside down to fit right. Otherwise coffee stayed in the basket instead of going into carafe.2. the entire thing is now broken and won't turn off without unplugging.It made good coffee when it worked and it worked for about 2 years I'd say.
2,Not as advertised,The brewed coffee is good but only warm. The brewed coffee is not hot and after stored in the thermos for 10 minutes it becomes too cold to drink.. The thermos sit on a pad which does not have a heating element. This coffee maker was advertised as providing hot (180) coffee and remains hot in the thermos for 5 hours.
2,Think twice about buying this product.,"There is an ongoing problem with the heating coil in this unit. We purchased one in October of 2005 and in less than 6 weeks after purchase the water was only tepid after brewing and the coffee was weak. We had this problem before w/ the same model we purchased from another online vendor but it lasted a couple of years so we thought we'd give it another try. Krups will not cover the cost of sending the model back to them for a warranty repair, only the repair itself and the return shipping. They did not change their policy even though this was the second time we'd had this problem with their product and this model was less than two months old."
2,Bad handle on coffee pot,"Very poor design of handle. We own two carafes, and attachment screws on both have come loose on the handle. We've had to pry off the cover on the handle to tighten them, which causes the cover-plastic to weaken, (because it wasn't designed to come off.) Moreover, the plastic attachment points of the handles are insufficient to anchor the handle to the carafe, and after 3-4 tightenings they break off, rendering the carafe useless. All in all, a very poorly designed handle system. We've tried to live with this coffee maker for as long as possible, but we're ready to try another brand entirely."
2,Do you like cold coffee?!,"Great looks and if you have a white/black/stanless steel kitchen it blends in well. The timer feature is also nice. However, the coffee is cold by the time the brewing is comleted. A very, very disappointing experience! We had another brand coffee maker with an insulated themal carafe (glas insulated) and it kept the coffee warm for half a day. This one is just worthless unless you consume the coffee immediately. If this is what we wanted then we would have purchased a regular glass carafe. I threw away the packing so now I am out $100. From now on I intend to read all reviews I can find before buying anything similar. I am soooo disappointed."
5,Great Coffee Maker,I got this coffee maker a few months ago.I read the reviews before purchasing it.Some were good and some were not so favorable.I personally love it. It is very easy to clean.It looks great on my counter.I have an all tile kitchen and did not want something that looked cheap in my kitchen.The performance of the coffee pot I think is great.I get a hot cup of coffee every time.It is no way luke warm like some of the reviews I have read.It may be luke warm if you put a half a cup of creamer or milk in it.The coffee tastes great and it is hot.I would recommend anyone to buy this coffee maker.
3,"It's good. Not great, but good.",I got this for my wife 'cause her old Krups went to coffee maker heaven (right next to microwave purgatory). We are happy with this but wish the coffee would be a bit hotter and that you could pour the coffee out without removing the top of the carafe.The quality of the coffee is very good though - we use a re-usable screen instead of paper filters and it works great.
2,Not Hot!,I was really excited about purchasing a new coffee maker with a built-in thermal carafe. My excitement dimished when I found that the product did not make or keep the coffee hot. How is this possible?
2,Misrepresented,"It makes good coffee but overall, I am disappointed. It is all because of the carafe. It only keeps the coffee drinkable for about two hours. After that, you are taking your chances because the coffee is lukewarm. I only wanted a coffee maker (with a carafe) that kept my coffee hot for a long time without having to worry about my happiness being ruined by the burnt,bitterness that starts after the pot sits there on a hot plate for longer than a half an hour. I had a cuisinart grind and brew before and I loved that thing but I didn't ring half the bells or blow all the whistles that came with it and I didn't feel like paying all that money for another one. This was expensive enough and I'm kicking myself. I could've bought a $20 maker at the store and got an entertaining carafe for a lot less and got the same result. ARRRGH!!!"
2,Worked well till it lasted,It made good coffee except on days we did not seat the filter and caraffe perfectly. After six months thermos blewup. I am not inclined to replace it . Changing Carafe twice a year will make it as expensive as Star bucks!
2,Weak Coffee!,"I've been disappointed with this coffee maker. My cheap drip Braun does a better job. I just wanted a thermal pot so the coffee didn't cook on a hot plate. Unfortunately I picked the wrong coffeemaker. The coffee is inconsistant with it's strength. I've noticed that when the water borrows a whole in the coffee grounds the water doesn't get dispersed among all the grounds and ends up tasting weak. The pot doesn't keep the coffee hot for more than an hour either, even when I pull the pot out from the brewer right away. Also, this is a tall unit and may not fit under your kitchen cabinets. I've had to tip it sideways to slip it under my cabinet. (Don't do this when you have water in it.)"
3,Suddenly Angry with Peg,"We bought this stoller over a year ago for our first child. My son is very comfortable in it. We even took it on vacation with us and were very pleased at how easy it is to fold and unfold. It's not very heavy and it fits well in my Nissan Maxima. Recently I have a few complaints. First, the fabric is coming apart at the seams on one of the sides. I called Peg and they said it was no longer under warranty. They go by order date which angers me because the stroller was purchased in Feb of 2002 and my son wasn't even born until August of '02. -And it took 4 months for the stroller to even come in! I'm still fighting with them on this issue. Second, the direction of the wheels and which are supposed to be locked and unlocked is driving me crazy. I want to simply go for a walk to the park and I'm all over the place. This stroller is very expensive so I expect the fabric to last alot longer than it has."
2,not a practical item for convience,"This is a nice looking stroller and rides very smooth. I am an active mom, I need my stroller for mall trips and just walks around the city. This stroller takes a manual and a degree to collapse and unfold. For quick trips, and stress free trips, dont get this one. One last thing, it is big and does not manuever too well between isles. I purchased the Graco Snug Ride Travel System instead and am very very happy. Since this stroller was almost 300.00 I thought it would be made a bit more convienent for us active and busy moms."
3,Great w/ couple of cons,"It's a great stroller because the bassinet part is big so baby will fit there for a while, or it's good for bigger baby. Baby can face you or 'the world', I loved that too. The wheels, though, are small but the biggest fault it has is the handle, it can be tilted up and down but when it's on 'down' position and you repeadedly put pressure on it [when crossing streets, high curbs etc.] it WILL break and I have seen that stoller in the garbage just because of that fault."
1,terrible product,"I bought this stroller because it seemed to be better thn the rest. The softness, 5 point harness and the fact that the arms swing back anf forth were very nice ... so I thought. However, this stroller turned out to be a nightmare! The arm bar is too low (I am only 5'5) and it was uncomfortable to push. The wheels did not turn properly ... ever ... and made for a terrible ride. It is VERY heavy and not good for the sidewalk. I purchased the so-called universal bar that would allow me to attach my Graco infant car seat but it didn't work!... Don't be fooled by looks and go for comfort and ease of use ..."
2,"Hey, I Don't Love This Lug","Do not consider this a ""technical"" review. Just from the gut. it looks great and the fabric is terrific and my son loves it...but the design just is not right. I live in NYC and I cannot steer this thing. Wheels are pretty bad. Storage is terrible. It is too cumbersome. Yes, it makes you feel like your baby is well-protected and he/she is, but other stroller do a good job too. My nanny hates it. We will continue to use it but we just got a second stroller (The Zippy by Inglesia) because this one alone does not cut it. One more time for the awful steeing."
2,If you want to hit your feet and have a sore back buy this.,"It's nice that it folds all the way down for a newborn. That is why I bought it. The material is snazzy too. I like the all weather muff and the way you can switch the bar to go from front to back. However, BEFORE you buy it WALK AROUND THE STORE SEVERAL TIMES. The design of this thing is lousey. You will, (unless you have a really short step) hit your shins on the bottom of this stroller. It seemed fine in the store. Maybe because I wasn't walking the way I usually do. But after I riped all the tags off and brought it to the boardwalk I realized how uncomfortable it is to walk with. I am not very tall, nor do I have exceptionally long legs. I was very unhappy. I will not use it again. I've had other people try it of various hieghts and they all agree. SO TRY IT FIRST or you'll be stuck with it like I am. I now have a [$$$] clothes tree."
1,"Inadequate for a stroll in Boston, MA","So I thought I would do the trendy thing and buy this stroller for it was highly recommened. First and foremost this stroller is extremely cumbersome. Opening and folding this large ""hunk of junk"" is impossible. Either the five point harness gets stuck upon opening thereby you are stuck with baby in hand and no easy way fold the stroller again so that you can retrieve the harness. It is difficult to manuver due to the small wheels around the city. In terms of going shopping forget it. It is too big and clunky to fit down any aisle in any department store. If you are traveling do yourself and your poor spouse a favor leave it home. Basically, I have found that this stroller is really useless. GRACO is a much better option and you can save quite a bit of money."
3,Not for tall parents,"This stroller is well made and the fabric used is superb, but it was not designed for the taller parent. I am only 5'7"" and I am too tall for this stroller. I wish they would have added an extention handle for taller users. I am very bumbed because I do like the stroller, but it is just too uncomfortable for me to use. I did read a similar review before purchasing this stroller, I wish I would have taken their good advice. Please do not purchase this stroller if you are tall, you will not be happy. TRUST ME. Save the money!!!"
4,Worth the money,I love this stroller. The main thing is the reversible handle. It enabled me to see my son when he was a newborn. Now that he's older I can decide which direction I want him to face.Also the seat has three positions which is great for the time when he wants to look around but his neck wasn't strong enough to support his head up for a long time.Also it folds up instead of down like a lot of strollers so I could hold my son with one hand and fold up the stroller to take the bus or throw in the trunk of my car by myself without assistance.i just wish it was lighter.
3,I've owned it for 3 years...,"After three years I finally listened to it today. What a let down. :( Some of the artists are not even singing the right notes. They are scooping everywhere on most songs! There are a couple songs that I will put on my playlist: ""Trading My Sorrows,"" and ""Open the Eyes of My Heart."" Most of the music can be found being sung better by other Christian artists."
5,Santana Abraxas,This is my favorite Santana album of all time. Brings back memories of the 70's. Had to get it. Great price too!
4,Worth its price for the digital remastering alone,"Wonderful album, worth its price just for its digital remastering of Albraxas. This 30th anniversary albumn also comes with liner notes by original Rolling Stone Magazine reporter Ben Fong-Torres in which Greg Rollie reminisces about the Albraxas recording sessions in 1970 and origins of the songs. Only flaw in this new CD is the rather gratuitous inclusion of several cuts from a live concert at the Albert Hall in London, which featured early versions of Se A Cabo, Toussaint L'Overture, and Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen two months before these tunes were definitively recorded on Albraxas. This live performance was horribly engineered (wouldn't you think they'd at least have recorded Greg Rollie's microphone when he sang Black Magic Woman?) However, all in all, this CD is a great buy."
4,age like wine,"This album still sounds strong after all these years, on the strength of it hits, black magic woman,oye como va, etc. The songs also brought into focus, an intensity from a band that usually engaged in long jams. Check out Live at the Filmore also."
5,Columbia raises the bar,"Columbia/Legacy has restored some of the best music in its catalogue, and this album gets a royal treatment. The three bonus tracks are from a live performance and give you a taste of the band's stage persona, but the sound quality is tweeked to perfection, if you have the old one, this is well worth the price. This album is essential to anyone concerned with an eclectic mix of rock. Blues influences are predominant, but the mix of jazz-fusion and Afro-latin rhythms make every track listenable and exciting. If your going to buy one Santana album, this is the one to start with, then go to his first and third albums. The rest will work out in time. A wonderful remastering to one of the greatest albums of all-time."
4,Great Playing,"Although I own most of the Santana catalog, I still feel this is his shining moment. Greg Rollie's organ playing, percussion section and singing all mesh perfectly, and Santana and Neal Schon are great together. Wonderful mood changes blend a complex tapestry of Latin, pop, and Afro influences into a joyous romp. They do a great job on ""Black Magic Woman"", to the point where few folks realize that this is a Peter Green composition from early Fleetwood Mac days."
4,GREAT LATIN ROCK,"EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD IS GREAT. FROM THE ARTWORK BY ABDUL MATI KLARWEIN TO THE REMASTERED SOUND TO THE PLAYING, WHICH IS THE BEST OF EARLY SANTANA. 'INCIDENT AT NESHABUR' AND 'OYE COMO VA' HAS AN AFRO-CUBAN FEEL WHICH DOESN'T SOUND OUT-OF-PLACE AFTER A PETER GREEN BLUES. 'HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER' AND 'MOTHER'S DAUGHTER' ARE RIFFS AS HEAVY AS LED ZEPPELIN AND DEEP PURPLE. BUT THE MOOD IS LATIN-AMERICAN. I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND SO WILL YOU."
2,Not a good DTS,"This DTS sounds terrible. The surround is done well -- probably from the Quadraphonic version -- but the mastering is really ""thin"", almost as bad as a CD. If you want a good-sounding DTS, try the Eagles' ""Hotel California"" or the Grateful Dead's ""American Beauty."""
5,Perfection,"How anyone can rate this at less than 5 stars, is beyond me. With their revolutionary fusion of Afro-Latin rhythms, rock, blues and jazz they took the music world by storm. This album has stood the test of time. It is still a best seller, and will still be selling, a hundred years from now. Listening to this album, to the sheer genius, it is hard to believe that they were all so young when this album was recorded, 22 years old on average. The bonus tracks were all recorded live at The Royal Albert Hall, London, on April 18th, 1970, and are a great addition to an otherwise perfect album."
5,Great service,This was for my husband. He really enjoys the older rock. We ordered it and it arrived before expected. Packaging was great and the CD sounds really good. Thanks for Great Service!!!
4,technical difficulties,"The music on this album is incredible, and it is definately a must-have for anyone with 5.1 home theater. HOWEVER, my DTS amp would not switch into 5.1 mode to play the CD. My DVD player indicated a 5.1 optical signal output, but the amp would only process this signal in analog Dolby Surround. This is the only DTS music CD I have, so I can't compare this problem to anything else. Again, the music is awesome, and Santana is the greatest, but when I saw the DTS 5.1 plastered all over the CD jacket I expected my DTS hardware to fully process the signal. The bass seems a little restricted, and I can only attribute it to my processing difficulties."
3,not the real santana,"When I saw Santana live back in '94, I decided to never buy another studio recording by Santana again, well maybe after he passes away. Santana is incredible, live; his performance that night made me question Hendrix."
3,...WARNING NOT VERY GOOD...,"This album is not one of his best!When I first heard it was in 2002.The only songs I really like on it are OYE COMA VA,BLACK MAGIC WOMEN and SAMBA PA TI.If I were you I wouldn't buy it.Santana has anew album called SHAMON, I think I made a reviewfor shamon that said I like this batter than his 1970 albumABRAXES."
2,Santana,"This dosn't have Rob Thomas on it and in fact it dosn't even sound like Santara to me. I borrowed it from my uncle because he likes Santana. I said is this the one with Rob Thomas and he said yeah, but he's always fulling around with us. This is mostly just some guy playing an organ and of course the mighty Carlos on guitar, but nothing you would hear on the radio, unless you like the oldy's station. What CD has ""Forget aabout it""?"
5,Great Santana album.,"This is probably the most memoral album with Peter Green (Feetwood Mac) influence. The great band line-up, with some of their most memorable songs, Black Magic Woman, Samba pa ti, and Oye Como Va."
5,Classic,Abraxas is what great music is all about. The songs segue beautifully from one to another and each is a true work of art. The live bonus tracks are pretty nifty too. Hopefully Santana's newest album (which is only about half good) will direct younger listeners towards this 1970 masterpiece.
4,Amazing at times but lacking a few things,"I'm glad I bought this CD though there are a few things that keep it from being a five-starred classic in my opinion. It doesn't have a strong ending. That's all I can complain about, though, because this is a GREAT album with a lot of emotional, amazing guitar work by no other than Carlos Santana. ""Samba pa ti"" is very touching, and could bring one to tears. ""Hope you're feeling Better"" is a straight-ahead rock song with some cool wah-infused solos and great performances by the whole band, the lead singer especially. ""Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen"", a very popular song, doesn't disappoint. overall a good album..."
5,One of the best albums I have ever owned.,"I first listened to this recording over 20 years ago, and still today I can put it on and marvel at the beauty of Carlos Santana and company. This is their finest album and an absolute must. The art work on the cover is alone worth the price of the cd."
1,Most disappointing!,"This version of Abraxas is most diappointing! The bass seems to have got lost - at least on a Bose loudspeaker set. Apart from the missing bass the music is remixed and sounds quite weird, not at all what the normal recordings sound like. I'm sure Abraxas could sound great in Surround - this version most certainly does not..."
1,DTS version an insult,"One of the all time greats. Someone had their head you know where when they mixed the DTS version. Dont spend the money on this one. The remastered version is the one your should buy. that said, the sound quality isn't all that bad except the fool who remixed this lost any kind of real bass response. Frankly i'm suprised that DTS even let this one out. I know they know better."
5,love that growwwwl!!!,"Had this installed on my 2006 Nissan Xterra and was pleasantly surprised by the extra HP and low end growl. Even my passengers notice it even before I told them about it. Not much of a mechanic so I had my mechanic install it. He told me that it was easy (I'll take his word for it). So if your proficient with instructions and know a bit about cars then this should be easy for you. I have always been impressed with K & N products, so I highly recommend this one!"
2,Bad handling,"The game was nothing special overall, but the thing that made it unplayable for me were the controls. While some adjustment can be made, options are limited. Keyboard and mouse or keyboard alone was unplayable."
4,Almost Too Late To Be Great,This is a great game if youre not prepared to wait until August of 08 or are interested in single player mode. The online capabilities may be out of question after this summer is over but the gameplay and graphics are phenominal. I totally recommend this game to all football lovers. The price is definitely worth the most rewarding football gaming franchises in history.
3,"Not bad, but not great.","This game isn't horrible, just not what I thought it would be.It's best to get football games for the consoles instead."
