1,I'll never get this time back.,"One of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen. Chris Hemsworth is pretty much the only person that is watchable. Save your time and money, trust me."
2,Hunting for a Story,"I recently watched this movie and the first 20 minutes of this movie was quite compelling. Once the character roles were established the movie went quickly down from the there. The movie had great potential and the story was well constructed in theory.Charlize Theron's performance was stillted and unconvincing. I wonder if she actually contributed more than just her name. She is a way better actor than this; she could have really delivered more.Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth were a little better, but certainly it seems as if the director was not encouraging their best efforts. Kristen Stewart had several believable moments but this movie needed more.So 2 stars and what movie was I reviewing again? It's that forgettable."
2,No plot,"The movie has beautiful cinematography, but no story line. Kristen Steward is lacking the acting skills she needs to carry the movie."
2,The special effects were pretty good...,"... but that acting. Wow, really really bad. This was the first time I have seen Kristen Stewart and if I see her in a film again I won't bother. Much like the John Carter lead, she was completely incapable of making me care one whit what happened to her. After awhile I kept glancing at my watch to see how much more I had to take. I wish they had picked someone who could act to play the role. Theron did a pretty good job as well as the rest of the crew, but Stewart completely ruined the film."
1,SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMEN,"BAD PICTURE AND ACTING. I WAS BILLED 4 TIMES AND ONLY RECEIVED 1 TERRIBLE FILM. PLEASE RECTIFY COST. AND PLEASE LOOK INTO COMPLAINTS OF OTHER COMPLAINTS I MADE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN LOOKED INTO, PLUS MY KINDLE THAT HAS NOT WORKED PROPERLY FOR 2 MONTHS AND NO ONE HAS RESPONDED TO."
2,Watchable but Underwhelming,"The movie had solid special effects and scenery, but the protagonists failed to draw me in. Charlise Theron played a haunting witch, but it didn't really matter, since I never cared much about Snow White."
2,Rotten tomatoes,"This movie is totally lame. It's use of fantasy was generic and inappropriate. Some of the special effects were great, but did not always make sense, as if it were a visual for visual sake. I was looking forward to the movie and was disappointed."
1,Very Low Resolution on Amazon Instant Video,"This movie was supposed to be visually stunning, but all that was lost when watching on Amazon instant video.I even downloaded to my pc, but this did nothing to improve resolution. Netflix is by far the better instant video."
4,snow white & the huntsman,the movie was good and had quite a bit of action. I love Charlize Theron and she plays a great part in this.
2,"Well it started out interesting, I'll give it that much. Bit Boring...","I wanted to watch this movie despite what negative reviewers said. I was even going to look past the cons and try to appreciate the pros. It started out interesting and then towards the end I couldn't stay interested. I wouldn't say it is a terrible terrible movie, it just didn't do the Snow white tale any justice. Not really worth a rental in my opinion. It's like hollywood just wanted to make a movie with the snow white title for recognition and then cast a few well known actors to make it worth your time. Then failed to deliver a great movie. Acting was a bit forced and weak. Well thats my opinion, don't get hurt."
2,It's good...Not great,Good plot...good story...just didn't like kristen stewarts sighs!....u pulled it in twilight...ok...other movies NO! I wish I could totally get my moo-laa back!
2,Too dark side,"I was rather taken aback with the violence and ""dark side"" quality of what is supposed to be a children's show. My 13yr and 11yr old and I sat to look at this, and they were more disappointed than I was. The typical ""good vs evil"" can be show without it being so dark. We came away wondering what the message really was in all that. The special effects and good acting, which we would normally appreciate, paled into the background. Very disappointing. Too many shows now have too much ""dark side"" to them. What ever happened to movies that left you feeling edified and entertained?"
4,Very good,"Good take on a classic. Very dark in certain parts if you have small children, Chalise Theron should play more bad roles she was really good, nice to see her in something outside the norm."
2,Good but not over the top,"I liked the movie, but I am not a big fan of Kristen Stewart. It was a boring day and I rented the movie from Amazon Prime to watch while I was doing my housework, but I can honestly say, I am glad that I did not purchase to movie for my home library."
2,Theron almost pulls it off,"Unfortunately, even Charlize Theron can't pull off the entire movie without much better acting from the Snow White character. We finally started listening for the times when Stewart would let the British accent would slip and just wait until we could see the menacing Queen in all her glory again. Everyone else was ""fine"", Charlize was glorious, Stewart oh so overacting. Sorry, even with Charlize, I can't recommend this."
2,Just OK ~ SPOILER ALERT,"A different spin on the whole princess happily ever after thing. The huntsman, not the prince breaks the spell? Could have had a better cast. Special effects were alright."
4,"Todays Version of the ""Snow White Fairy Tale""","I must say I enjoyed this movie enough to see it twice in the theaters and also purchase the DVD. Chris Hemsworth is definately easy on the eyes, and the visual effects were astounding. I ejoyed the story line and the humor throughout the film. The dwarfs were adorable.....it had the stuff to entertained both the male and female population."
1,Fun Story. Bad Audio. Shame on Amazon.,"I've rented this from iTunes before but wanted to see the extended version so there is some grounds for comparison. The biggest difference is the audio. The iTunes version has great audio but the Amazon version nearly blew out my speakers. On the Amazon version, the sound effects were at a normal range but the dialogue level was so low. So low that at moments with dialogue and sound effects you either couldn't hear the dialogue or your sound is turned up too high for the sound effects.So for watching a fun, fresh take on a classic story I'd give it 4 stars (cant be helped. It has Kristen Stewart in it). For audio quality, I give it a 1. In all fairness, it did have sound."
4,"Low profanity, good flick!","I am normally not into this kind of movie, but I will have to say, I enjoyed it! I rented this movie for the grandkids and I like the fact that this movie has very little profanity which is very unusual these days. Evil forest, fairy forest, good vs. evil battles and it actually has a good ""storyline"" which is also unusual for this type of movie. I do recommend!"
4,kristen stewart is a pretty good actress!,"A dark twist on the snow white fairy tale! I was pleasantly suprised by the special effects in the movie! The evil queen scared the hell out of my kids! Definately not a kid-friendly movie, but damned good for adults. I didn't even have to tell them to leave the room, they left ot their own accord! Get your popcorn ready, ladies and gentlemen!"
2,What The..?,"Who the He** is the Huntsman? Who is the evil-queens brother? What are they doing in this story? Man-Oh-Man, they really took some liberties in this story - poetic license I think it's called.... I guess it's basically, fundamentally, sort of the same story... I guess the real, actual, award winning story, the story known and loved by millions of people, the story with such positive messages - that story wasn't good enough for Kristen Stewart. If this movies didn't have such good special effects, I'd wouldn't have watched it all the way through. I'd have turned it off probably way earlier than those shrunken A-holes that were supposed to be dwarves. Loser of a story..."
4,Better than I thought it would be,"Charlize Theron made an excellent evil queen. The movie itself was depicted gorgeously. While I thought I would not like the movie because I did not (and still really don't) buy Stewart performance as Snow White, Theron's performance and the beautiful cinematography made up for the poor casting of the lead role.."
3,Meh,"I've seen better, I've seen worse. I skipped all of the Twilight stuff, so this was the first time I'd seen Kristen Stewart act. Like so many others have said, serious lack of talent there. Dead eyes, she looked stoned through the entire movie.The rest of the cast was good or great. The movie had a lot of potential, and it might have been great with a different actress playing Snow White."
3,Short and Sweet,Charlize Theron is perfect in this role. She made the movie. The scenery was awesome. The Black Forest was cool and creepy and the Dwarfs were good as well as the creatures and special effects in this movie. I personally won't buy this unless i can get it used for a few bucks. It was a good movie but lacked something in my opinion. It just wasn't the block buster i had hoped for.
1,Watch the trailers...you've watched the entire movie.,Very disappointing. Almost no story line. No character development. The picture quality in blu-ray is great. Kristen Stewart looks very attractive. Charlize Theron looks very angry. Tough guy looks tough. Short people...hobbits? This movie wishes it was Braveheart and Lord of the Rings.
3,Not top shelf but not bad either.,"Charlize Theron...VERY good, Chris Hemsworth also does a good job, Kristen Stewart...I just don't think this was the part for her. No real emotion from her character or her. The plot is pretty decent...all in all I would watch it again and I would recommend it to someone else. But, its not going to be on your top shelf."
5,not your normal fairy tale,"If you don't think of the original story and go open minded, you can enjoy the movie and special effects and be surprise on the way the story is played out."
4,"Good movie. Original, I interesting take","My wife and I enjoyed this movie. We were pleased with the storyline, the acting was good, and the effects were good as well. We weren't sure what to expect but we're very pleased overall."
2,bad acting,a movie made for tv more than anything else. kristen stewart does not come off as a new more powerful snow white.
3,Snow white,"Mmm so so , I think the movie needs better actors, betters especial effects , and better drama . Everything else is good, actually, I dotKnow what I'm talking about"
2,"What is this, Legend?","Combine The Neverending Story, Xena, Legend, and Snow White and what do you get? This movie.!!! So how could it fail?It's the tired tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and nothing was done to make it really interesting or fresh.The actress who played Snow White just didn't do a convincing job.The evil queen is barely in the movie, maybe less than ten minutes. Snow White and the Huntsman? The Huntsman didn't have a decent role in the movie. There was just no magic to this one. Bland, very bland."
3,Snow White...,"So Charlize is amazing as always. But Kristin? Really? Do we need an ""American Idol"" for actors? Someone tell her she sucks."
4,Snow White & the Huntsman,"The movie was okay, but it did not hold my total attention. There was too much hype about this movie. I have to watch it again with full attention to it."
4,OK Movie,"Charlize Theron was the only really strong performance in this movie. Chris Hemsworth was disappointing--not believable. Stewart was not very believable, either. The action was fun and Theron's tantrums were interesting. I do not regret watching this movie; however, I would not watch it again."
1,Do not Stream this movie you wont get to see it.,I have Netflix and Hulu Plus. I never have any problems streaming movies from other venders. But Amazon stops every two minutes to catch up with its buffer. So if you want to watch a circle go round and round for two hours the go ahead and stream this. I will never rent another movie from Amazon.
1,snow white and the huntsman (extended edition),"This was not what I saw at the show. I got three differnt movies,and none of them were like the moive that I saw this summer.I love going to the movies, and I love seeing them over and over again but this one I was very upset about it, they took to much out of it.I wish they would just leave it alone it was great as it was and now it is not."
5,Not a Disney fairytale,"I'm hoping this comes out in a two or three disc version.Charlize is wonderful as the queen, and Kristen plays her part very well. Chris is such eye candy. I'm a Twilight fan, but saw the movie in the theater with an open mind. The costumes are terrific - should get an Academy Award. I liked that the history of the main characters was fleshed out. The battle scenes could have been a little longer. I felt myself caring for the characters, including the dwarfs who are NOT named Sleepy, Dopey, Doc, etc. the visuals were stunning. I passed on Mirror Mirror to see a more adult version of the story. Glad I saw it, and will add to my DVD colletion."
3,"It's not you, it's me",I can only tell you that I bought it.. Amazon.. via Roku player.. and I was so enthralledthat I watched it in three sections over two days.IOW I was so unenthralled that the only reason I finished watching it was becauseI paid for it.Compare this to say... From Hell.
1,Stupidest Movie I've ever seen,"I went to see this movie in the movie theater with my girlfriend. (I had no interest in the movie, but you know how that goes.) I've never before wasted my money on such a terrible movie. The acting was terrible, and the transition of the movie was even worse. My girlfriend agreed with me, worst movie we've ever seen at the theater. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE."
1,pity for the fairy tale...,Disgusting!!! So much violence. Lack of real imagination and lack of tenderness that in fairy tales balances the cruelty of violence. If a young one or even a child sees it before sleeping he will have some nightmares. Perhaps minds are different now. Think that our mothers and fathers used to recite or read to us snow white before sleeping!!!But the actors were very good and the same for the photography.
1,Do Disappointing,"I'm not a big movie fan, but my husband is. Although the effects were spectacular and the story line was unique, the movie dragged. We didn't watch it to the end, so I'm not sure if it got better. I'm glad we didn't pay the $10 per person to see it in the theater."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"The dwarves are probably the most interesting part of the whole movie, which is drawn out far longer than it needed to be. It is okay for a cheap rental but you may end up fast forwarding now and then."
3,Unremarkable,"Well, actually some of the visuals are quite remarkable, but the plot and acting disappoint. I guess the plot doesn't really disappoint because I wasn't really expecting much. It sort of wanders around looking for the next special effect. And in the end there's a sort of showdown and the movie ends. And then you get another beer and look for one of the backup movies you rented, because while this movie is reasonably fun and sort of entertaining, it left me distinctly unsatisfied."
2,I wanted it to be good...,... but it was an utter mess. If it had kept to the internecine struggle or the major battle epic it would have been fine but it didn't do either well.
3,Pretty movie to watch,"There is a bit in the middle of the movie that is just too much, and just kind of drags out the story. Still, a great movie to watch on your fancy HD TV. Probably too much for little kids though..."
3,"Entertaining, but...","If I could give this movie 3.5 stars I think that would be a little better.I did find this movie entertaining, but I think it could have been better.Charlize Theron steals the show, hands down. I hate Kristen Stewart as Snow.This movie wouod have been much better with a different actress in that role.Her acting sucks, and she always seems sad. She's just a depressing person in my opinion.The dwarves are awesome!!! They totally add the comic relief that Kristen Stewart kills. And you have a Norse god in the mix too!! How can you not like Chris Helmsworth? He's a bad a$$ pure and simple. If you're a guy and you don't want to be him then you are lying!I did like the storyline, and thought the pacing was good.Overall this is a movie I'd watch once. Probably not more than that though.If you're bored and there's nothing else then maybe give this a shot.Hope this helps someone."
2,Blah,It wasn't nearly as good as i heard it was. I was rather disappointed in the movie over all just didn't have the impact that the trailers made me think there would be.
4,It was good,It was better than expected .... Good to se kristen Stewart in a different movie she was good in it
3,It was OK,"I think I enjoyed the concept of Snow White being a dark tale instead of a Disney fairy tale... but this totally missed the mark. It was an OK movie, I enjoyed many of the scenes and the actors - but I was left wanting more."
4,Great movie,This film was wonderful. Everyone in my family enjoyed this film. Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron were fabulous and the supporting cast were terrific also. The film contained alot of action scenes and great dialogue. The cinemetography was beautiful. It had some violence but not nearly as bad as most movies today. I recommend this movie.
5,Snow white and the huntsman,Charlize theron was amazing. The stars did awesome the storyline was also very well twisted to make it a must see.
2,Walt said it better,"I bought this DVD on recommendation of a friend, he said it was a good movie. NOT! It was boring, dreary and with a face and personality of Kristen Stewart who cares. To think a dwarf had to die for this dreary and colorless person is an outrage. The subplot of the Hunter and his dead wife adds nothing to the story. Also since Snow White didn't choose between her childhood buddy or the Hunter does that mean there is a sequel? If I spend any more money on the Snow White saga, I'll buy the Disney version."
1,"Avoid, unless looking for a nap.","I rented this thankfully so not a whole lot was wasted but my time. Me and my kids watched this together one night and even my kids 11 and 9 year old girls were bored to tears. This movie lacks all substance and if your looking for a real plot look elsewhere. Huge waste of time, want to watch a fun fantasy movie go back to Princess Bride or the newer Stardust but whatever you do skip this!!!"
2,Snow White and The Huntsman,Quality of the stream was less than average. Movie in general was very predictable suited for the intellect of a 7 to 10 year old.
4,Pretty Good,"It is hard to get excited about yet another fairy tale remake. My husband talked me into watching this, and it wasn't bad. Kristen Stewart just isn't a good actress. The movie was okay."
4,Dark and Satisfying,"Pushing aside any Disneyesque trappings, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" delivers a power struggle between between Beauty as Truth vs. Greed as Evil. Dusted with just the correct amount of Romance this dark cake tastes just right. Kudos to the filmakers for not making the Evil Queen, (God I love that girl from South Africa), a caricature. An oblique mention of possible abuse of the Evil Queen as a younger women is interesting without being gratuitous."
4,Good movie to watch with older kids,"We chose this movie because it wasn't your typical Snow White version. I have older children that like movies that have the same feel, not so fairytale-ish. The start of the movie is great, doesn't drag, takes you into the movie and really tells you the background of the story. The only thing I didnt like was the storyline between the huntsman and Snow White. It sort of leaves it to interpretation, their relationship or how they feel about one another. The ending is another part that I didn't like. No, dialog, took to long...kinda dragged. Otherwise...I liked it...we bought it and we have watched it a handful of times already."
5,Great Movie,This is a really good movie because it puts a new twist on an old fairy tale. Of course you know the ending just not how to get there.
1,Snow White & The Huntsman [HD] (Amazon Instant Video),"Poorly written, bad acting, written for teenagers, rested on the special effects. I was really disappointed, the trailer got my hopes up. Editing was choppy, on the entire script just never flowed."
3,"Charlize awesome, lovely lovely effects, lots of other bleh","With boost in writing, better Snow casting, and more of a twist on the classic tale, this would have been a great movie. Charlize Theron is worth seeing though."
3,A decent film and charaterization of the tale,"Since many film makers are digging into the classic fairy tale reserve and making updates, there will likely be many more such films coming in the future. This one was reasonabley done and competently executed. There's nothing special or really compelling about it, but it is worth viewing for those that like the fairly tale/legend genre of films."
2,"Disappointing, yet predictable","The angle of the movie was interesting, the special effects are very impressive and Charlize Theron is majestic, she proves once again that she is not just a pretty face, she knows how to think and act, unlike Kristen Stewart who should really rethink her career as an actress. And it's me being nice."
2,REALLY!!!!!! 2 hours of my life i can't get back.,"TRUST THE REVIEWS ITS REALLY SUCKS!!!! i only give it two stars, bcuz Charlize Theron did such a great job. i kept hoping that it would eventually pick up and i'd stop falling asleep, but no such luck. i even went back just in case i missed something while i was sleeping, but i missed NOTHING. uuuuurgh i'm truly disappointed, becuz i was excited about the cast and concept for the movie. Next time i'm going to Mickey Ds Dollar Menu with my 3.99 :(!"
2,Thumbs down,"With all the hype about this movie I thought it would be entertaining enough to keep my girl friend awake. She falls asleep during every movie we see. This time I fell asleep twice. Some good scenes but this movie is boring, jumpy in terms of characters and ""what the hell does that mean"" in terms of one liners and dumb look scenes like at the very end. This could have been a real good movie if some consistency and thought had been placed in making things like the journey over regular countryside more dangereous and longer than through the deadly dark forrest. And the troll??????? As to her acting, well two dimensions, is two dimesnisons."
1,Wanted to like it... but HATED it!,"Honestly I was excited to watch it, but the whole thing was a dark, boring mess with good special effects. I honestly want those 2 hours of my life back! Don't waste your time. Take a nap instead!"
2,Dreary,"The whole movie had an air of despondency, no happiness or humor from start to finish. The acting was poor and none of the characters were particularly sympathetic."
4,Intense,"This moving was intense and entertaining, despite some small holes in story/plot, and a few scenes with less than convincing acting."
4,Well done and enjoyable,"Good cinematography with strong performances from the cast, in particular Cherlize Theron. Interesting storyline and very different from the Snow White fairy tail we grew up with."
4,I like this movie.,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal, it was really great re-make on an old story. I would definitely not recommend this for children however."
3,Queen should have been the center,This production was disappointing hence the average review. I think it would have been a lot better with more of the queen as the central character. Perhaps the sequel will explore this avenue as Show White (who's not so 'white') may not be in the followup.
3,Movie was ok,I was expecting this movie to be a lot better. When I saw the previews it looked sick. It was alright though.
3,Just ok,Maybe because I didn't have the whole affect of being in a theatre ornhaving an HD TV but Inthought this movie was boring. Effects were cool but that's about it.
3,Another Interpretation of the Fairytale,The costumes and general look of the picture were nice. The supporting cast performances were more notable than that of the principle cast. Overall the film did not live up to all the hype in my opinion.
3,It's ok if you can get pas the bad acting,"This movie is not the worst I have seen, but the lead actress was some of the worse acting I have every seen before and just killed the movie for me. With a different lead this could have been a great movie."
3,Charlize was a good wicked queen!,"The special effects were awesome. The highlight for me, however was Charlize Theron as the wicked queen. She was a great wicked queen."
3,"Fun effects, yet could have been much more...",I enjoyed the special effects. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth both gave great performances. The story felt like it was almost there but still did not quite cross the threshold to great. I did enjoy it and like the different spin. I do not know much about the story of snow white except what Disney and a few other productions have generated.It is a good rental but I would not purchase it.
3,ok but not great,Theron I feel did a great job. Plot needed some work. I just find it hard to believe a girl that grew up in a cave prison. Is going to bravely led an army the next week.
4,Great movie,"Once again, Charlize has amazed us by her outstanding performance in this film. She draws her audience in and holds their attention. Altogether, great movie."
2,Why that girl from twilight,"How is she the most beautiful maiden of them all, she looks like a troll. The troll in the movie look better then her. That is no the real reason to hate this movie, no wait it is. She can't act and she is a princess locked away in a tower for many years. But some how when she breaks free she is this master swords women. Who is able to kill the queen, that is this all powerful witch. Don't worry this is not spoiling anything that you could figure out form just watching the trailer. Overall look is good, visual effects were amazing along with the 3D elements."
2,Beautiful Film with Horrible Script and Editing,"This could have been a great film. But it is a terrible film. The potential was all there... timeless tale, great visuals, star -studded cast, probably plenty of money...it looked expensive. Alas no soul. Horrible dialog, lame plot, clunky editing. I don't agree that the acting was bad. There's just no way the actors could have looked good given the terrible editing. They were left flat footed delivering lines that were trite to start with in scenes that were cut with no sense of timing whatsoever. Total letdown. Avoid unless you like to mentally rewrite entire movies."
4,Must see,We can't get enough of this movie. The graphics and sound effects are terrific. Unique take on the old fairy tale!
4,Great movie!,A great version of a Brothers Grimm tell. Great acting and special effects and I will watch it again :)
5,Good Purchase,"The DVD was well received by members of my family, and even though the characters are a bit off beat, everyone enjoyed the movie."
2,DVD skips,"Brand new DVD, never been opened, has a scratch on the DVD. The DVD skipped parts of the movie. Tried to clean DVD, still skips. Very disappointed!!!!"
1,worst movie i have seen this year,worst adaptationworst acting by everyone - everyone is sooooooooooooooooo dramaticworst editing - a lot of the scenes are very darkworst worst worst
2,Dreary movie,"This movie starts in a dark and grimy fashion and it seems to end there. Snow White and her Huntsman have zero chemistry, making for a strange and awkward fairy tale ending, which is fitting for a Kristen Stewart movie. The Huntsman actor is much better as Thor. The dwarves are not menacing or cheerful, just very weird. Not worth the purchase or rental price."
2,Well we won't get that 1 hr 30 mins back,Just didnt really like the movie the concept was ok but the acting wasn't amazing and thought there would be a better twist of plot but two much of the old snow white incorporated in my opinion.
2,Good concept. Bad execution.,"Good cinematography. Lousy story, directing, and acting. The monologues in particular are really painful to watch. Nothing else to say, really."
1,BORING!!!,not even remotely close to as good as the book. Kristen Stewart SUX!!! I thought the effects couldve been better. I was seriously bored the whole time!
2,Bad Karma,"I don't know what I expected based on the title, but I was angry after seeing the film. They've taken a wonderful fairy tale, with moral impact for youngsters, and destroyed all its value. Now it's just another vehicle for promoting violence and gore. Don't let your kids under 20 see it. It will spoil their imagination."
4,evil and creepy,"this movie definatly put a twist on the story, not sure what to say, rent it and see if you like it"
4,A Good adaptation of the original story line put a new twist to the story.,"This different approach to the original story line was actually very good, my wife and I enjoyed this story and movie on a Saturday night rental from Amazon off of our kid's new WII U in HD. The service was easy to sign up for and the Wii U was easy to order the streaming movie. This story got us watching right off the bat and keep us glued to the TV during the development of the characters and story line. No spoilers here so take my advise and either purchase or rent this for your own entertainment. One note this story line might be a little much for younger viewers as I said before this is not like the original Disney Snow White and very young viewers might not understand and even scare them, so viewer age approach should be followed."
5,she loved it,gave it to my wife for a christmas present and she loved it. so glad i was able to find it on here.
1,Dissapointing,"This movie was a total let down. Snow White was not a strong enough character, I found myself sympathizing with the queen."
5,Loved it!,"Despite the bad reviews I have heard, I loved it. I think this was a great representation of this fairytale. I will probably watch it again."
1,Seriously?,This movie is indicative of the decline of the movie industry. Apparently all creativity has disappeared. This is another terrible remake of something that didn't need to be remade or re-imagined. Don't waste your money.
2,Snow Job and the Huntsman,"A lot of publicity (hype).Terrible sound quality ... No equalization ...Had to increase volume while talking and decrease during music and action.Terrible unintelligible accents made it difficult to follow plot.Disjointed, like pieces of the movie were cut out.Depended on visual effects. The only decent acting was presented by Charlize Theron (Evil Queen)Overall, the most worthless movie I've rented since joining Amazon."
2,Poor Directing,"Very poor directing made for a disappointing movie. All the ingredients were there, but I'm not sure the director had the vision. The ending was stupid; what was with the long . . . take on Kristen Stewart with that ridiculous expression? I like Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, but even they couldn't save this one. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this at the theatre."
2,Walt Disney version was better,"This movie had it all: bad acting, bad directing and bad writing. At some point Hollywood decided that special effects could substitute for these things. One of these days they will wake up and realize they can't.There are a number of young, attractive women in Hollywood today who can act: Kristen Stewart is not one of them. She and Robert Pattinson should get married, take the fortunes they made doing the Twilight movies and spare us anymore pathetic efforts at acting. Casting directors should help them make this decision.Charlize Theron is too good an actress to have squandered her energy on this movie. Watching this movie was a total waste of time. My advice is to re-watch The Lord of the Rings which this movie tried to emulate to no avail."
5,Snow White & Huntsman,"I didn't expect to like a ""dark"" version of Snow White but I realy enjoyed this movie. I found it to be beautiful in a haunting sort of way."
3,I didn't hate it.,"On family night, I was prepared to fall asleep on the couch but I ended up watching it all. Although... I was secretly hoping for Charlize Theron's character to prevail against the horrible actress who played the lead role."
3,Good but ending was lacking,"Fairly decent movie throughout. A nice, dark twist on the Disney version many of us grew up on.However, both my wife and I looked at each other in disbelief at the ending of this movie. The acting looked dramatic but the dialogue fell far flat. How the heroine defeated the bad queen wasn't apparent despite obvious attempts to setup an understanding of it previous.***SPOILER***More than anything else, it just felt like there would be a romantic aspect to this movie. The best friend boy as a child who lets nothing stop him from finding her. The rugged Huntsman who's redeeming himself for the guilt of his wife's death. There are numerous opportunities for this to have been something more than what it was. Maybe it couldn't happen because the director was getting a little out of movie romancing from Kristen Stewart of his own?"
2,In a world where Snow White will never be anywhere near as beautiful as Charlize Theron,"If you like repetitive Kristen Stewart affectations you'll be fine with this. Casting rather stinks but the art directions, effects and wardrobe are stunning enough to make up for it. Watch it with the sound off."
1,Visually beautiful but that's it,Visually this movie is stunning but that's the only redeeming quality. Charlize Theron's performance is way over the top and I didn't care about any of the characters. I just couldn't wait until it was over.
2,Well that was mediocre......,"The more I watch Kristen Stewart, the more I come to the conclusion that she has no or little personality. In this movie she played Bella (Twilight), nope, I mean Em (Adventureland), nope, I mean Sarah (Panic Room), nope, I mean Snow White. I think you get the idea. She is blah in the entire movie. The other parts of this movie are pretty predictable as well - Charlize Theron cries (again - she does it in every single movie she's ever made). Chris Helmsworth, who I generally like, has a bad, quasi Scottish accent that comes and goes. Please do not waste your time with this flick!"
2,Poor writing and acting,"I give this two stars instead of one based on Charlize Theron's performance. She was the one light in this boring poorly written snore fest of a movie. I am very glad that I did not pay to see this at the movies. Reading the reviews I thought the blasting of Kristen Stewart was just mad Twilight fans who wanted to get back at her for cheating. Turns out Kristen is just about the worst actor I've ever seen. Even given the weak script her performance brought the movie to a new low. The speech she gave near the end of the movie was so badly delivered it had me and my 14 yr old daughter laughing. My wife, always the smart one, had already given up on the movie and left the room to do something more interesting with her time. I feel like this could have been such a good movie that just missed the mark."
2,Snow not so white and the old huntsman,"Movie was ok but silly. I think the seven dwarfs were the best part of the movie. Kristen Stewart I'm sorry is not the fairest of them all. i don't really have much to say about this move. it really was that same old story with a not so believable twist i just was not buying the characters. ""sorry Rupert Sanders"" if you like twilight you may like this movie..."
3,Fairly entertaining but not the fairest of all,"Being an action and suspense fan, this movie didn't sooth my savage beast. It started with a bang but began to slow about midway. It became close to boring and the ending was not satisfying. The commercials for this film depicted scenes of treachery and blood lush which enticed me to see it. The film did not delivery. It was fun to watch for a while and worth the 4.99 rental from Amazon but I wouldn't see it again or add it to my library."
3,"It's ok for the visuals, a shame Kristen Stewart acted on it","I didn't realize Kristen Stewart acted this movie, It looked like she was sad, waiting for her vampire to arrive all the time.A nice start for the story every one knows about, but failed to deliver with inconsistencies of the main character and the lack of acting."
5,Awesome.. Completely Awesome!!,"Not many movies make me say, ""Wow"" anymore. This one made me say it 3 times. From the effects, to the story line this movie just carries you through an amazing adventure.Ignore the negative reviewers. Just watch it without any prejudgements like a child does listening to bedtime stories from his/her parents.On the box, one reviewer comments that ""It'll blow you away!!!"" He's absolutely right!!"
1,worst movie of all time,"This movie was, simply put, awful. From the bad acting to the cheesy effects, this movie had nothing going for it. The plot was lame - we've seen the re-dos of too many fairy tales lately. Let's come up with something new, Hollywood. Not even the exceptionally good-looking cast was enough to keep this movie off my ""worst ever"" list."
1,Snooze fest,Snooze fest overdone with horrible acting. I can not imagine why this was so popular a movie but I watched it once and gave it away.
5,Good one,"This movie was a wonderful experience visually. The colors, the scenery and the acters.....I loved them all, especially the special effects."
5,Great movie!,This movie was awesome. I received this as a gift. uploading this to the cloud is fast and convenient. thanks!
2,Skip This Movie,"This movie has a few entertaining moments that are buried beneath a flimsy plot and poor writing. There is very little payoff, which only compounds the loss of two hours that this film took from me. I do not recommend watching this movie."
2,Charlize was GREAT!,"However Kristin Stewart is really an awful actress. There is nothing animated in her acting, she has but three facial expressions and they all say constipated. How this girl became an ""IT"" kinda gal is beyond me. She acts like one of the better junior high drama club enthusiasts, however in a Hollywood movie, we do expect more than this level of acting. The overall movie was predictable, and slow. I really wish I could find the right guy who will return the time I wasted watching this ""very not good"" movie.I say, see it if you've got nothing else to do and this movie is one you can see for free. Otherwise, I am sure you'll have a better time watching your dog's toe nails as they grow."
2,snow white and the who?,I thought the movie moved to slow and there was a very weak storyline. Effects where good but i need more than that.
3,It's worth a $1 rental...,"I'm kind of surprised at the number of '1 and 2 star reviews' on this one. I just watched it with my 12 year old son and we both thought it was a decent movie. They obviously had a large budget, because the special effects and cinematography were outstanding. Funny thing is though, I mostly rented the movie because I'm a fan of Charlize Theron's work. However, I thought she was the one weak point in the movie. She probably should have changed her interpretation of her character; it seemed a little forced and almost fake. Interesting Biblical references throughout the movie...resurrection, forbidden fruit...that sort of thing. Anyways, it's worth renting just for the visual effects alone... story is good, not great....some acting flaws kind of bring it down a bit. It's about a 3 1/2 star movie in my book."
2,Not much depth to a story line that offers so many possibilities,"I was disappointed to say the least. Especially with Theron's take on the evil queen.She might have worked this in a more subtle way in order to gain the confidence of Snow White. Moreover, the ""Huntsman"" never really seems to come to the fore."
2,"Visually a good looking movie, but the plot dragged on for way too long.","The visual effects in the movie looked great. The acting was alright, but the story did not have enough to sustain a movie that long."
3,Needs different female,"Beautiful, superb oscar-nominated Charlize Theron totally upstages beady-eyed, immobile-faced, buck-toothed Kristen Stewart. I guess Stewart slept with the director to get this role!"
5,On of the best Snow White Rendition,"I recommend this movie to anyone who loves classics. One of the best interpretation of the timeless fairytale.Love the digital, blue ray dvd."
2,Boring,I was so excited for this movie. I was really not impressed with it. Kristen Stewart is still a bad actress.
2,Abysmal,"Poorly acted. Poorly executed. Good idea. Zero character development. The story line is disjointed and does not flow. It appears the director tried to emulate Peter Jackson, but fell short."
4,loooovvvvved it,"This movie had me in awe and sucked me in. I dont like kristen stewart's acting, however, i could stand her in this movie.It was a great new twist to snow white. It has so much potential to be a better movie though"
5,Amazing,This movie is amazing .. I love it the best movie ever you are awesome for making this movie god bless
4,"""Snow White and the Huntsman""","Won't let the fact that the behind the scenes scandal brought my ""Like Kristen"" button down a few notches and my disappointment after the lovely and innocent Isabella Swann affect my rating of this movie...Chris Helmsworth and Charlise Theron did good jobs as the huntsman and the evil queen...a bit of horror added to the real Snow White story but everyone eventually lives happily ever after..."
4,"Snow White, Warrior Princess","The heroine in Snow White and the Huntsmen is a far cry from the comely, delicate Snow White of Disney’s fairytale fame. The modern version is a princess whose mother the queen dies, and father the King is seduced, betrayed and killed by the evil, now his queen, Ravenna. Still a mere child, the princess is imprisoned and after ten years escapes. The queen, will live forever if she takes the life of Snow White, so she dispatches the Huntsman, a wild-eyed trouble maker, to hunt the princess down. Upon finding her, he succumbs to her beauty and charm and teaches her the art of the sword. This is an action packed adventure, with a fine cast: Kristine Stewart and Charlize Theron.In the end Snow White regains her throne and the evil queen meets her sorry end."
1,Kristen Stewart is truly awful.,"I desperately need to understand how this girl has a career as an actress. Seriously, will someone tell me? Surely she hasn't banged EVERY director she's worked with. Her excruciatingly dull performance not withstanding, the rest of the movie is kind of entertaining.The script is weak, but Charlize Theron is perfection as the queen. And the special effects are beautiful, but it's not enough to carry the film. Casting agents: There are a ton of talented young actresses out here. Try harder next time."
4,Entertaining,"This movie had it's highs and lows but enjoyable...at times it brings other moives to mind! Makes you wonder, what?"
4,good,Wasn't what I expected...kristen wasn't impressive but charlize was wonderful & chris as eye candy was good. The special effects were good :)
3,A little better than OK.,Somewhat clunky but fun fantasy in the theme of snow white. I had no idea there were so many Snow white stories variations out there
3,Snow White & the Huntsman,"I really liked this whole new take on the Snow White story. This was definitely very action-packed (guys would actually like it) but for us girls, a little more romance would have been nice. The end was a little frustrating because it just left you hanging but I hear there may be a sequel. If so, then I am definitely looking forward to this story continuing."
3,Good movie,This movie was good...despite Kristin Stewerts horrible acting. Not sure how this girl keeps getting such good lovie roles. Shes got one look...the 'who farted' face and thats it. Charlece Theron was awesome and the movie was dark and entertaining. Not appropriate for kids.
4,Very good movie,I thought it was a pretty good movie. Enjoyed the special effects and the actors seemed to be in their role and made the movie fun to watch.
2,Keep Your Cash,"The title says it all, I mean how desperate are you for a movie plot, the animated version was better."
2,Seemed incomplete,There wasn't a booklet with the dvd and the person I gave it to was disappointed and wondered if it was used.
1,not worth it,"I enjoyed the special effects, but the plot and acting was horrible. The only reason I finished it was because I paid for the rental."
2,Really?,"Terrible movie, terrible directing, Kristen Stewart is like the new Kevin Costner, sometimes british sometimes not. It kills my suspension of disbelief that she could ever be fairer than Charlize, (who I expected to be awesome but was just eh?) Chris Helm is decent eye candy but there is very little build to romance or actual romance. Fail Fail Fail."
1,impossible to sit through,"Shut it off after the first half hour. Just gore for the sake of gore, and a bore fest galore. There's a shortage of quality movies nowadays. Just big-budget, made-for-money crap."
3,Kristen Stewart didn't disappoint,"I'd heard bad reviews for this movie so was skepticle. Overall, not a bad movie! Good pace, lots of action."
3,Snow white decent,Snow white isnt in category as Avengers or Hunger games. Its decent. Charlzie Theoron makes your spine cringe as evil as can be and still puts the competition to sleep with her looks. One scene she is cream colored into the agless bath. Kristen Stewart on other hand cant act and movie would be much better if someone else was in role. Chris Hemworth and the dwarfs are great.
4,Good but opened,The product was supposed to be new but the movie was opened. It plays well and looks to be in good condition but I was disappointed that it was opened.
2,Be Warned: This movie is NOT FOR CHILDREN!,"Please be warned! This movie is NOT FOR CHILDREN! The PG-13 rating is no lie, here. There are images and themes in this movie that could easily give any sensitive adult nightmares. Here are some EXAMPLES of only a few of the scenes children would find deeply disturbing (as did I): The evil queen tells her newly married husband, the king, of her hatred of men, who ""use women,"" just before she kills him on their honeymoon bed. A few scenes later you watch as her brother kisses her shoulder as he and the queen hint at an incestuous relationship with each other. In order to preserve her beauty, the queen eats the hearts of an animal or bird of some sort, which you see cut open at her dinner table, as she digs the heart out and puts it in her mouth. The queen pulls the heart out of one of her subjects after he attempts to assassinate her. No child should ever be exposed to such horrors. You can definitely cross this movie off your Christmas list!"
4,Great visuals and concept,"I really liked this movie, mostly for the visuals and concepts. Kristen Stewart was surprisingly adequate, too. I have seen about an hour of the Twilight movies, and Kristen's inability, in those movies, to open her eyes or close her mouth seemed absent in this picture. Theron does a great job as the queen, as well."
4,snow white & the huntsman,Good movie. Sorry I waited for dvd should have seen it at the theater. Buying it online was easy and now its always there. The should have offered a rental option.
3,pros and cons,"Honestly, i think it was pretty good. Some of the acting was a bit...bad (mostly by the huntsman) and WTF one of Snow white's friend's (wont mention name due to spoilers) is completely dropped off in the end of the movie..like it never showed if he lived of died no nothing... and he was a decent part of the story!!"
4,entertaining,the best of the recent splurge of rewritten fairy tales that Hollywood has released to the veiwing public. Focus on different characters and different characteristics than the written stories.
4,Worth Watching,"Great story line, good acting, and worth watching. I enjoyed watching this new version of the classic story, but not suitable for children."
5,Different look for snow white,not a kids movie. i am open mined to different takes on stories. This one was interesting and gets you thinking.
4,ok movie,Any movie with Charlize Theron in it has me from go. Isn't Charlize beautiful? Ok that was rhetorical. Go Charlize!
2,SNow White,I don't care for Kristen Stewart's acting. She acted just like she was Bella in the Full moon movies. I don't recommend it.
2,Ridiculous!,"What was meant to be epic misses it's mark shamefully. Kristin Stewart as Snow White? Really? Wasn't she bad enough in that pathetic twilite movie? Charlize Theron thinks that screaming her way through every scene captures the essence of the evil queen. It's rumored that soon all actors will be computer generated as opposed to human. Who would possibly know the difference? Thank God celluoid has protected the magic and talent (and yes, beauty) of Hollywood at it's peak: Greta Garbo, Cary Grant, Rita Hayworth, Gene Kelly, well.... you get the idea."
2,Very Disappointing,"I rented this video with great anticipation; but, even the beautiful Charlise Theron couldn't save the Movie. Kristen Stewart was her same one-dimentional actor who spent most of the movie with her mouth hanging open (just like she did in the Twilight Saga movies) and next to no emotion registering on her face. I really wanted to like this movie, and I really wanted to see Kristen Stewart in a different arena than vampires and werewolves, but she just didn't deliver."
1,Potential Unrealized,"On paper (and in commercials), this looked like it should work and that made it's failure all the more disappointing. The back story was hurried together and created no sympathy or depth in the characters. For all the rich visuals, I never felt completely immersed and there was no broken ground - everything looked like something that had been done already and done better. Charlize Theron's character should have been much juicier, a queen that you rooted against but enjoyed watching. She simply was not fun to watch. The movie was unsuccessful at creating a sense of dread. By the time the dwarves showed up, I was completely checked out and the rest of the movie - too long, by the way - was a complete drag."
4,The Huntsman,A good family movie with an updated twist to a classic. You got more of the story than what you knew as a kid.
3,topical entertainment,"luckily Ms Theron planted the anchor for an other wise mis-cast, weakly written version of this timeless classic. A heavy reliance upon CGI and DI was most likely pitched to compensate for weaknesses in story. What's most unfortunate is that because of the convenience of visual animation and the economy of filmless production, we're left with lazy filmaking. Regardless of the negatives, the perspective is fresh in trying to keep with traditional versions and I'll still keep it in my library along with the other variations. If it's any consolation, it was well shot, visually pleasing and the effects were pleasant. I killed a bowl of ramen noodlez and a PB&J sandwich, so it wasn't a total loss. A formulaic guilty pleasure indeed."
3,Just a movie,"The movie is just okay...but I would think that snow white should show way more emotion than she did...plus--where's the prince. Total disappointment really.However costumes, sets were pretty good..."
2,Disapointed,"Great storyline, special effects but Kirstin Stewart was not the lady to carry it off. Through the whole movie she looks a though she forgot what she was suppose say or do. He absent mindness slowed the action down and I lost interest. I fast forwarded through the movie so I move along."
2,Not that great!,I felt that the story left a lot to be desired. So what I'm supposed to get from this movie is that there is power in being the fairest? Could've been much better.
2,Boycott Kristin Stewart,"This movie had a chance. It really did and honestly is started off well. The plot was a unique twist on the classic fairy tale and all seemed well. Then entered Kristin Stewart as Snow White... Uggh. Hopefully she will be able to purchase some acting lessons with what she made on this movie because breathing heavily and looking sad/confused all the time doesn't make the cut. Its really too bad because Charlize Theron was remarkable as the evil queen and it's a shame to cast a horrendous actress such as Stewart opposite Theron. The only value in watching this movie was that I can now, without a shadow of doubt, save money in the future by avoiding any film with Kristin Stewart in the credits."
3,Stunning visual affects,The acting is sub par. The dialogue is corny. The visual affects and colors are amazing. Chris Helmsworth is yummy. Charlize Theron plays a believable witch. Snow white should have been a different actress.
1,sucked,too bad they didnt kill this chick in twilight. cant tell if this isnt twilight with this whiny depressing no talent hack kristen stewart. this movie was painful to attempt watching. i thought the other cast would make up for the always depressed stewarts lack of range but i was wrong. total waste of time as i couldnt watch more than a few minutes of it. my 13 and 15 yr old daughters thought it horrible as well
1,AWFUL!,WE HATED KRISTEN STEWART! SHE SERIOUSLY NEVER NEEDS TO BE IN A MOVIE EVER AGAIN! SHE RUINED IT. The worst part is that the movie probably would've been great for a cheaper actress....
1,"Trite, unsatisfying eye candy","Kristin Stewart continues her legacy of looking and acting completely stoned at all times. Charlize Theron is semi-worthwhile, save for her atrocious accent. Chris Hemsworth needs to lose the shirt and the Scottish brogue from Central Casting. Otherwise, it's a fun movie to watch while it's on mute, though I never need to watch it again."
5,SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN,I REALLY LOVE THE MOVIE THE ONLY DOWNSIDE TO THE MOVIE IS THAT I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO IT LIKE HAVING THE GIRL GETTING TRAINED AND REALLY READY FOR THE BATTLE TO COME BACUASE WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU JUST CAN'T WAKE UP ONE DAY AND BE A WAR HERO! BUT OTHER THEN THAT I THINK IT'S A GOOD MOVIE! :)Snow White and the Huntsman (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)
4,good movie,"it was a good movie. even my husband, who was not looking forward to watching it and usually falls alseep, stayed awake and watched it, he thought it was better then he expected and good."
3,"Kind of weird, dark. But still enjoyed somewhat.","It is dark version of Snow White, definitely. It wasn't horrible, didn't have much language. Not something I would watch again, but didn't regret renting it. May have regretted paying the high price of seeing it in the theater."
3,Kept wishing it was better.,"CGI in this movie was great, but I still found it lacking. LOVE Charlize Theron, but her voice was forced and didn't seem natural. Had heard Kristen Stewart didn't change her facial expressions throughout the movie... and found out it was true. :-( Watched it a couple of times, but don't think I'll be owning this one."
3,Okay,I found this movie entertaining and that is what I was looking for with this movie. Would recommend this movie for light easy viewing.
3,"See it IN SPITE of Kristen Stewart, not BECAUSE she's in it!","A film I liked MUCH better than I thought I would ... and worth seeing not because of Kristen Stewart (whose acting range is that of cardboard), but rather in spite of her. Same story; evil queen (Charlize Theron, EXCELLENT here!) needs to off her ""fairest one of all"" stepdaughter Snow White, hires hunky huntsman (Chris Hemsworth, also very good here in mini-Thor mode) to do the deed and bring back the girl's heart. Huntsman can't do the deed, they hook up with seven dwarfs (sorry, ""little people""), and then Snow White goes all Terminator and gathers an army together to take back her kingdom and stop the evil queen's dark tyranny over the entire land. Nice fight and action sequences, cinematography, and Theron's icy queen make it worth a look, for sure."
3,Snow White & The Huntsman,Beautiful movie but not too exciting. You watch just to watch. Good special effects. Beautiful scenes but mostly a dark movie.
3,Interesting Twist on a classic tale,"I found this movie entertaining and I enjoyed the twists they put into the story we are all familiar with. That said, I felt it started to drag about 2/3 of the way through and was ready for it to be over. It's worth renting, but not something I would want to own."
3,So-so and poor ending,"Loved the cinematography and how the story had parts of the original Snow White theme in it with the poisonous apple and the dwarfs. BUT, I too am not a K.Stewart fan. I thought there must be other young actresses much more beautiful to portray this character AND someone with stronger acting skills than Stewart. How about Rooney Mara for instance?That said, the movie's ending was weak to say the least. There's this longshot of Stewart looking really clueless and then the closing credits. How lame."
3,Forgetful,"I watched this, and it was okay. The traditional story is loosely within the overall plot. I didn't get a sense of any emotion between the hero and heroine. The standout character is the Cherise Theron."
3,Good but expected it to be better.,"Although it was good the movie seemed to rely on special effects more than solid acting. I didn't feel like I really knew the characters very well. I didn't ""care"" about them which is an important element for me to really enjoy a movie."
3,disapointing,"I thought the movie was just ok, I was more disappointed with the ending than anything else in the movie. It was a little too long without enough ""actual"" story line and the ""forest"" reminded me of Princess Bride which in my estimation was a MUCH better movie. But that's another story. I was thinking about buying this for my collection but will bypass it completely."
4,I would call this film The Hobbit lite - Great tasting and less filling,"Thanks to special effects you don't even need to hire real dwarves anymore.. This film was entertaining and despite the dwarves Chris Hemsworth still steals the show. Everybody made fun of Charleze Theron's crummy english accent but it wasn't all bad. Everyone knows the worst brittish accent ever was Kevin Costner in Robin Hood, this wasn't even close to that. Kristen Stewart wasn't all that bad in this. Not a lot of dialog from her, which I appreciate. She still doesn't seem to want to close her mouth very much. She still has that same blank expression on her face all the time. So she doesn't really speak and it's not Twilight so it's got my vote!"
4,"Despite the personal drama, movie really good","Charlise scared me as the Evil Queen. WOW. Intense! I also think Kristen Stewart did a great job as Snow White in a very different light than we have seen before. I loved the visual elements of this movie, the dark forest, creatures, etc. Then the light that she brought with her pureness and love. Can't wait for the sequel!"
3,Good not great,sad that kristin stewart doesn't have more talent than twighlight. all other actors excellent. snow white could have been so much more.
3,Could have chosen a better Snow White,"Kristen Stewart is not the best candidate for Snow White. As a fan of Nina Dobrev, I seriously believe she is a better actress and more likely to incur the wrath of the beautiful queen as being more beautiful. Loved Hemsworth and Heigel."
3,Adventurous,Engaging but not what was expected. Not a bad movie but could have been more...hmmm...just more. A more modern spin off of Snow White with a medieval twist.
3,It was okay...,"I honestly expected more from what the commercials lead on. After a while the movie began to drag, this movie had so much potential, to be more with its actors and cinematography."
3,For Want Of a Script...,"I desperately wanted to enjoy this movie. The cinematography was excellent. The costuming and scenery were fantastic. The FX were extremely well done. Charlize Theron was excellent in portraying the evil queen. Chris Hemsworth, on the other hand, was doing a second rate copy of Val Kilmer's role in Willow. The dwarfs stole the show.The problem is that the screenplay was just plain awful. It allowed little or know character development, was formulaic and predictable. It also appears to have drawn so much from Willow that at one point, I remarked, ""Where is Fin Rizel"".I have mixed feelings about the film's direction. On one hand, the scenes were well set up, but I can't determine if the way the actors presented their lines was the fault of the director, or the script, itself.FWIW, the quality of the video and audio on the blu ray version, is excellent."
3,Could have been better,A good adaption of the Snow White story. Great visuals.Captivating story. Wonderful acting except for Kristen Stewart. She portrays Snow White as she did Bella in the Twilight series and this just does not work for this movie. I would not purchase the movie but it's okay to rent for a one time viewing.
3,It's o.k.,Glad I did not spend the money to see in the theater. Was expecting more content. Worth the money as a rental though.
3,Well it's Pretty . . .,"Very lovely (at times) and odd. Beautiful cinematography. Um, strange story and well - okay, pretty strange everything. Nothing makes any sense at all, so don't bother using your brain. I think the kids could watch, I don't remember anything too violent, sexy, etc. Just saw it with my husband & we thought it could have been edited - to about 15/20 minutes. Actors did their best to hold this mediocre script aloft. Little resemblance to the fairy tale you remember, this is sadly very forgettable."
3,A little lite on the story or maybe Snow White Lost her Way,"Cinematography was great. The performance of the wicked witch was outstanding. But at times the story was not filled out enough - it lost its way now and again. I wanted to know more about Snow White, the Huntsman, what about the other interesting folks from the Dukes castle? Those wonderful women that took Snow White and the Huntsman in - Where were the men? Why were they gone? No remorse for the Wicked Witch? Very good elements were strung together - I got the salad but were was the meat and potatoes?"
3,It's an OK movie kinda slow..,"Visually stunning and dark version of the originl tale makes it intriguing, but not the best movie. Lots of drawn out sequences that aren't ery well explained but lead to some good special effects. My bottom line is it was worth the 4 bucks to rent, but not 5."
3,Snow White and the Huntsman,Charlene made the movie. She was spectacular. Kristen Stewart neeeds to not be Bella in every movie. Great special effects and it was an interesting version of the story.
3,Update of classic snow white story,"Very good special effects, good story, seemed to combine parts of several classic fairy tales. (The evil stepmother, the evil forest, etc. But generally a good, easy to follow storyline, and of course the happy ending. I liked it."
3,greaaaat,I enjoyed this movie very much.... the plot and the graphics was well done... the action was ok... but witch coming out of white milk and out black tar feathers was well done...Thank you for the fast delivery too....
4,"It's a story we all know, but i enjoyed the different adaptation.","I enjoyed the different sort of Snow White character as well as the Huntsman. Not a super movie, but it was enjoyable!"
4,interesting development of the story line,"It is faithful to the basic outline of Snow White and provides some interesting detail, for example, why the queen is wicked. The acting for some roles could be better, but if you are looking for something interesting to spend some time with, it is worth it."
3,Interesting but?,"A bit 2 dark & need more substance. I don't know, it just didn't do much for me but the visuals were excellent."
2,Poor,"OK, the queen was not bad, the forest was interesting. That being said, the angst was so thick you could cut it with a knife. The end was so poorly done and so flat faced that it reduced my review a star for just those few minutes. The story was so predictable that it actually put me to sleep (in the theater, not even comfortable chairs). I have to say, unless you are a twilight fan, flee from this movie, it is a one watch movie at best."
1,Terrible..just terrible,"This movie is poorly written, acting is only so-so. My wife was wanting to see this badly and she fell asleep 1/2 way through."
1,Disappointing Film,"Don't let the trailers fool you, if you saw the trailers you've seen the best parts of the movie. The special effects are ok but the acting is mundane. The movie could have been good but just missed the mark. Don't make the mistake of purchasing this blu ray it is a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend renting it as that is a waste of money too. Just wait for it to come to television because at least then the commercials will add enjoyment to the viewing experience."
3,Despite Great Promise,This movie felt like it had some great promise but delivered what you would expect from a cookie cutter film.Helmsworth is underutilized and Theron was hampered by this predictable script with nothing truly new.
5,Spellbinding,"Plesantly surprise by both the quality of the acting, the exceptional screenwriting and cinematography, and most of all an unfettered fanaticism for Ms. Theron."
3,Another average movie,This movie had the potential for greatness but falls short. Charlize Theron is of course excellent as expected. I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart and here is another reason why. Kristen goes from not being able to hold a knife to leading an army and taking down the queen. Very unbelievable. The world however was very imaginative and beautiful. Battle scenes were almost good but usually bland and hurried. I wanted to like this movie but ultimately its just an average 3 out of 5. Watch it if you want but don't expect a instant classic.
3,The trailer was better,"So many things about this movie just could have been soooo much better. The spacial effects were great. The characters just needed a bit more depth. The actors did a great job, i just don't think they had enough to work with. I wonder if a directors cut would be what is needed - just felt like there was something missing."
2,So So,This really didn't hold my interest. Charlize Theron is good but the rest is just so-so. It just wasn't all that interesting.
3,Kind of just OK,"This movie could have been better. There was something missing from the story, it failed to capture the sense of a real love connection between Snow White and her ""true love."" Special effects were great but failed to make up for the shortfalls in the story."
2,HD?,"The movie was great but when downloaded to watch it, it was not in full HD, it's more like regular dvd. The tech person I've hired says I have the latest and explained it just the way it was recieved. I rather buy the disc and/or watch it in non HD and save cost in the future."
2,"It's ok, nothing special","You won't be disappointed if you skip this movie, it's nothing special. The beginning is better than the end of the movie."
2,Sub-par. Semi-interesting at times. Could have been so much more.,"Disappointing. Long. Lacking in many ways. This film needed more ""life."" Too ""flat"" in many respects. The Huntsman is rather lame. Snow White could have been much more likeable and purposeful. If you can watch it for free, perhaps. The entire film is rather dark in terms of lighting."
1,Bad Acting.,This review is about the movie not about any sellers. Kristen Stewart is the worst actress ever I was soooo very excited to see the movie thinking possibly that her acting would be better than any of the Twilight films. She seriously ruined the movie I felt as if I were watching a different version of twilight. They need to remake the movie with a different actress!!
2,Please never cast Kristen Stewart in a lead role!,If it wasn't for the stunning performance of Charlize Theron then this movie would have been a 1 star. Kristen Stewart is so terrible and so oddly disconnected that she appears partially tranquilized. Thank goodness they didn't give her more lines! And the scenes where she is supposed to come across powerfully to evoke the kind of connection to Snow White you want to have. No chance!Charlize Theron and the huntsman carry this movie to its final conclusion. Which is ruined by a queen apparently struck deaf and mute standing around after being crowned. Can't wait for a remake with Kristen replaced with a decent actress who can look at the camera with meaningful expressions and evoke emotions from the audience.
4,A Good Movie With Strong Acting For the Most Part,"I am a fan of the recent fairy tale movies that have been coming out. So I did see Mirror Mirror, and now I have watched this. This was definitely a much different look at the Snow White story. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth did an amazing job in their roles within the movie. Both actors made me believe that they were their characters and they did a great job at this altogether. Kristin Stewart on the other hand would not have been my pick for her character. Not that she didn't fit the role, she did, but whether she was believable in this role she really was not in my perspective (but I would say similar things to her portrayal in the Twilight series as well). Overall, the movie was engaging and though darker than other fairy tale movies, it was action packed and fun. Overall, I enjoyed this, though the acting by Ms. Stewart could have been stronger."
5,Great Adaption of a Great Story!!,"I love this adaption of Snow White. So much better than Mirror, Mirror, which even for a kiddie movie was horrible.Charlieze plays the best evil queen ever, Even better than Julia Roberts and Sigourney Weaver. I hope she returns for the sequal if one is made at this point.Kristen is quite good in this movie she still is very dpressed in the way she acts but I think more people in the reviews are hating on her due to the Robert pattenson fiasco and not really revieing the acting within this movie. Girls, Rob will be fine im sure : )But if you are looking for an entertaining retelling of a classic get this DVD. I saw it in Theartres and cannot wait to see the special features that it has to offer."
2,Good story idea....but not well defined,"Really wanted to like it, but acting was flat. Characters were dry, really could not identify with any of them. Special effects had promise but were used willy nilly with no punch. Overall, sorry, it just was not interesting."
1,"Long, drawnout and Boring!!!","Long, drawn-out and Boring!!! How the heck is Kristen Stewart the most beautiful one of all and Charlize Theron the ugly sorceress? True fantasy here, not."
3,only watch for the queen,"There's an awful snoozefest in the middle where she's not in the movie. She is the only reason to watch the movie. They should have given her more screentime because she's beautiful,has great screen presence, and is a great actress."
1,Poor acting by KStew,Poor acting by KStew. I love the other actors but saw the movies once do not have the desire to repeat the experience. KStew ruined this good movie. Charlize is awesome as always. Heard there is a sequel but it's just going to be the huntsman.
1,LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG,This movie was 2 hours long well let me tell you it felt like 4 hours. It was slow and very boring.Everyone said it was such a great movie. Well I am glad I didn't see this in the theater. I don't seewhat the big hype is about Kristen Stewart. I think they could have found a prettier Snow White. Thatmight have saved her relationship with Robert Pattinson. Overall not really worth your time unless you want to take a nap.
1,Don't eat the yellow snow!,"I regretfully fell prey to this aweful display of acting and overall storytelling. To be fair, Charlese Theron and Mr. Helmsworth were at their usual best, but were still not enough to make up for Kristen Stewart's usual depressing, monotone, unconvincing, amateur, pissy spoiled teen performance. I hate it when movies don't live up to the expectations set by the trailer."
2,Boring and too Dark to see,I found myself falling asleep in the this boring film. It was too dark and you need a really need a dark room and time to focus your eyes.
2,Disappointing,"On the up side, the special effects were great. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth gave good performances, though Hemsworth was pushed into the background pretty quickly.On the down side, Kristen Stewart got a lot of screen time. This wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that she can't act her way out of a wet paper bag. She has no emotion and is totally unconvincing. Also, the writing was a little iffy. It wasn't terrible, but it was obvious that the screenplay did not live up to the director's aspirations.My expectations for this film were not that high to begin with, but it still failed to reach them. If I had it to do over, I'd save my money and wait for this to come to Netflix or Amazon Prime for free."
1,awful!,"I expected to be entertained. Instead, I was bored to death!!! I love fantasy and horror, not horrible. The plot was scattered. The acting awful."
2,Lackluster with a Touch of Blah,Mirror...Mirror starring Julia Roberts was a much better movie. Neither the Huntsman nor Snow were fully developed characters and didn't deserve their status on the marquee. An imprisoned Snow White doesn't emerge as a warrior heroine but as a girl lost to her circumstances. And who is the huntsman...an actor stuffed in a role for his looks because he cannot be the love interest of Snow White? This movie suffered from a case of reaching for too much while giving too little.
2,What the.....,"Charlize was great. She brought back memories of my phyco b**** from hell stepmother. That was worth a star. The story is a good one, the eye candy was ok too.... But Kristen's inability to act was a huge downfall. It's like she struggles to convey emotion with her face.... So not worth it"
2,Disappointed,........ ...... .. . .... ... ...... ..... ... .... .... ..... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . ... .. ... .... ... ... . ..... ... ... ... ... ... .
2,A little short on content,So this movie is better than a few other Snow White remakes that came out recently but that isn't saying much. The director obviously wanted Kristen Stewart for the Twilight popularity and a little something on the side (just Google it if you don't know). She isn't real believable in any movie I've seen her in and always seems constipated before she delivers her lines. For some reason Charlize Theron seems a little off here don't know why she is a great actress maybe it was the writing. But that said the rest of the actors are pretty good the dwarfs are awesome and the sets are done very well. So not the worst movie you could watch but certainly not a great one.
1,I need 2 hours and 8 minutes of my life back,"Firstly for those people who found the preview alluring let me warn you this ""action packed movie"" spends more time blankly focusing on Kristin Stewart making all the same ridiculous facial expressions she did in the twilight movies. The plot started off as a promising one , but quickly they get caught up in trying to create beautiful eye catching scenes rather than actually telling a story. The movie earned the one star but Charlize Theron and Liam Hemsworth both did a great job."
1,stinks,K-stew can not act! worst movie ever. Dont waste your money. Use real little people next time. nothing is worse then full gown men trying to act like little people. The queen was the only good thing in the movie.
1,Waste of time.,"Felt compelled to stop watching about 1/2-way through. Once the dwarves come out, there's no rescuing the movie. Charlize Theron does a pretty good job, but the rest of the cast are pretty wooden and boring."
4,Entertaining,An entertaining retelling of a familiar story that doesn't shy away from its dark side. Good acting and great effects.
1,Ridiculous.,"I gave it 1 star because there was no option for zero. Why did Charlize ever do this stupid movie? Terrible writing, stupid plot, fake story."
4,Almost perfect,"Snow White and the Huntsman was a nearly perfect movie. Charlize Theron was amazing as usual. As was Chris Hemsworth. His fake Irish accent didn't go over too well, but his performance was excellent. Another highlight for me was the seven dwarves. I loved the new take on their life style, and the actors were very well chosen. The only drawback for me was Kristen Stewart's acting. I will say this in her favor, however, she did seem to put forth more effort in trying not to be so wooden. But it is painfully obvious that she is trying. I'm not sure if it's lack of confidence or what, but she always seems very unsure of herself. I do hope that she is able in time to grow into a more mature and confident actress. But for now, I would love to have seen the movie with a more adept actress playing the part of Snow White."
4,A different view,"I enjoyed this version much more than Mirror, Mirror. I think that Charlize Theron is amazing and her portrayal of the evil queen is wonderful. Definitely could have a sequel.."
3,Snow white,"Thought it was better ,good graphics but predictable ,glad I waited for it to come out on dvd maybe if Kristen Stewart ,focused more on her acting instead of other things lol she would have done a better job"
4,Much better than I expected,"This movie is much better than I expected. I went in with very low expectations, particularly because of Kristen Stewart's involvement. However, this movie shows that once she is out of those awful sparkly vampire movies that she can act though she was upstaged by most of her co-stars, particularly Charlize Theron.The picture was crisp and beautiful. The sound was very good as well."
1,SnowWhite & Hunts Man,"Movie very dark, slow moving, poor acting, and BAD director..... Became board and sorry for the purchase in the first 5 minutes. My rating: D.D.....for Double Dumb!!!"
1,Tedious and predictable...,"... another tiresome, politically-correct ""girl power"" princess-gets-butch-and-puts-on-armor reinterpretation of a classic tale, with attempts at ""Gladiator""-style slow-motion combat sequences and sets imitating those in ""Game of Thrones."" I had the misfortune to be stuck on a transatlantic flight with no functional reading lights, and so found myself watching this film out of desperation. The only redeeming factor was the ever eye-catching Theron. Otherwise, fans of the fantasy genre should give this one a pass. Might appeal to teenagers obsessed with ""Twilight,"" I guess."
1,Get Stewart Some X-Lax,Maybe its just her acting but Kristen Stewart looked constipated the entire movie with a some relief in the final minutes of the film. Also Theron who is super hot was made fugly by CGI and lowered the entertainment value of the film for me.
1,Boring,This movie was totally boring and I had no connection to any of the characters. Only interesting thing about it was the special effects for the evil queen.
1,Snow White & The Huntsman Movie,Since when & in what story book was snowwhite a warrior? It was nice to put a twist on the storybook tale but at least let it make sense. The story line was horrible and Kristen Stewart as snowwhite was even worse. Kristen Stewart plays a good character in Twilight but not this movie. Did not like the movie at all
4,Snow White but a bit dark,"Snow White & the Huntsman (this version) is not the tale you were told as a child. With taking the “dark side” into consideration, Snow White and The Huntsman was very well done. Cinematography, Acting, Direction and Plot all covered all the best they offered. I can see where it would win an academy award but knowing Hollywood it may not happen. 2 Thumbs up!"
4,Enjoyed this movie,"I enjoyed the different take on a classic fairy tale. It was well acted. Charlize Theron was excellent as the evil stepmother, and the huntsman was a fun twist. Overall an entertaining movie."
4,Great,Liked the movie. Got it as a present for my brother. He loves movies and this one was a good on to add to his collection.
5,Loved it!,"This is one bad a@@ fairy-tale! Charlize Theoren is excellent, and who couldn't watch Chris Hemsworth being fabulous for a few hours? The special effects are impressive in the veeeeeerrrry scary Dark Forest. Loved the end, won't give it away, but Ms. White is no simpering, helpless princess. Awesome!"
3,Bleh,The extended version isnt that much different than the regular theatrical version. The movie was only good because of Charlize Theron
3,Interesting Version of Snow White,"I enjoyed watching the film. I liked the edgy side of this fairy tale. It is told much more in a Grimm fashion instead of the gooey, Disney fashion. I like that Snow White had to fight the witch/queen. I liked the Huntsman and William and how only the one who had won her heart made her wake up. There will be some who may disagree on who that should have been!!!! There was one thing left decidedly undone. I believe on purpose, but because I like films to have all things decided and final at the end it lacked the romance for me that I thought would have been nice since this is a fairy tale after all."
3,Eh...,It was a movie. Not a good movie or a great movie but not a bad movie either. I thought Charlize Theron was incredible (as usual). She was the best thing about it.
4,Good Movie,Again the Instant Video service is great.The Movie was enjoyable with many aspects of the original pre-Disney fairy tale. The CGI Was good and the acting was fair. I would recommend watching at least once if you like fairy tale movies done well.
4,watching SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN,"THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD AND A BIT SCARY, THE ACTORS WERE GOOD ESPECIALLY CHARLIZE THERON, MADE SOMETHING FROM THE STORY MAKE MORE SENSE, NOT SURE FROM THE ENDING WHAT ELSE CAN BE TOLD, WOULD DEFINITELY RECCOMMEND IT TO OLDER TEENS AND ADULTS.... SOME SCENES WERE PROVOKATIVE!"
2,Blu-Ray functionality is less than perfect,"DVD disk plays OK, but the Blu-Ray disk is less than perfect even though the sleeve boasts ""perfect Hi-Def picture. Perfect Hi-Deb sound?. Maybe they just tried to load too much on it. It claims to have numerous bonus features, but getting them to play is more than tricky. I did try other Blu-Ray disks in my collection and they played just fine.I think in the rush to get a copy with all of the supposedly alluring extras, Universal put out a defective product. Gave it two stars only because I can play the DVD even though I paid for and looked forward to the Blu-Ray copy. Wonder if I can return it? What do you say, Amazon?"
2,"Two stars, to kind...lol","This is worth the buy when it makes it to the 5-7 dollar bargain bluray bin, so if it gets there pick it up. The previews before the movie should have been a clue this is a B-movie, nothing more. To be fair I watched the extended cut, the shorter version may be less painful...lol"
3,Kristin Stewart cannot act either,"The relationship between the queen (Theron) and her brother were better played off than the one between Snow White and the Huntsman. If I were him I would have thrown her out at the beginning. To be truthful this movie is worth watching because of the Queen, the Queen's Brother whom almost took over this movie, and one of the dwarves (Bob Hoskins). Not to say the Hunstman didn't try to play his part it's just when your working with a no talent it's difficult to shine. Recommend - see it once for the dark and then decide whether it's worth seeing again."
2,Kristen fairer than Charlize? NOT.,"This was a really boring Thor movie. Oh, wait. It wasn't a Thor movie? That explains why he wasn't using Mjolnir. Go ahead and waste two hours watching this - I did. The best part's of this movie were, of course, the villain. Charlize Theron tried so hard to make her character good n' scary, but the dialogue was too...dumb. But she was still the only interesting character on the screen. The CGI was really good. Actually, the CGI was the best actor in the whole film. I think that they should animate Kristen Stewart's upper lip - because it doesn't do anything."
2,Could of been great,This movie could of been great. However all the times you saw the evil queen in the movie were what you already saw in previews. Also Kristen Stewart sucked as usual. I never liked her ever as an actress. The only role I kind of like her in is twilight but still she is just so annoying. In my eyes she will always be a horrible actress. Story line could of been a lot better. Previews make it look like you are going to see a different type of movie then what it really is.
1,horrible,"It stop several times and was blurry, the audio was good when it played. Not sure who fault it was with the feed."
1,Sucks,This movie is terrible. Not worth the $15 theater price and definitely not worth whatever they are charging for it on here. You couldn't pay me to see that movie again. But I quite liked Mirror Mirror-- buy that instead
2,"Radio doesn't work, at all, out of the box.","I wanted to buy a non-battery dependent flashlight for my car and my wife's car. The idea of having a built in AF/FM radio was a great bonus. I couldn't decide what I wanted, but for only $5 I thought I'd give this a try. I actually ordered 3 different units, all Kaito. I bought the KA004, the KA005, and the KA404R. The radio on this one didn't function at all out of the box. The AM/FM selector switch was very stiff and hard to move back and forth. I'm going to send mine back. For $5 was too good to be true!"
2,Disappointing,"The Barron's Mastering courses begin each lesson with ""Basic Sentences"" where you are introduced to knew words and phrases. In the Spanish course you are given the entire phrase and then the sentence is broken down starting with the last word, then the last two words, etc. However, in the book the individual words are given first, building up to the sentence. Not only does this mean that the CDs do not follow the book very well, but often times the last word in the sentence will be a word you have already become familiar with and the first or second word in the sentence will be unfamiliar. As a result you get to practice the word you already know quite a bit, but not the words you don't know.I've also used Barron's German course. The German course builds up with the words first, then the sentence. This also means it follows the book. I found the German course to be great, whereas I would not recommend the Spanish course."
4,Lots of Content,"This set has a lot of CDs to listen to, but the book isn't very helpful. I use the book for translation not for following the dialogue. What this book is really useful for is intermediate Spanish speakers who need to work on their pronounciation and building vocabulary. It seems most of the accents are Spanish, whilst americans are trying to communicate with mexican spanish speakers. If you listened to these CDs on a daily basis, though, repeating the dialouge, you would gain a lot."
4,Lots of fun,"I was suprised at how high this hovercopter goes. We took it out in a field and it must have gone 250-300- in the air. You can't steer it in any direction but just the hovering capabilitys make it fun and challenging to try and keep it under control. It is extremly durable and charges very quickly, (under 10 minutes). The downside is that if you really try to go high the battery only lasts just a few minutes. All in all this is a fun toy."
2,FUN!! For a few...,"This toy is easy to use and is fairly durable for a styrofoam flying saucer. It's great because of how quickly a little guy and get it flying but since all you can control is how high it goes (no left to right or any other direction), my son lost interest fairly quickly."
5,Very cool toy,"I was hesitant to buy this toy after reading many bad reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how cool this toy is. My 11-year-old loves it. It charges quickly, runs for a decent amount of time on each charge, and is quite durable, despite being made largely of Styrofoam. It hovers with amazing stability, and its altitude and descent are easily controllable. It's very cool to watch it go! We are very satisfied with this product."
1,"Do not, under any circumstance, buy this toy.","I think my title is a tip-off to my review. When I got this toy, I charged it for as long as it told me, then I tried it. It didn't even sputter. Then I tried it again, and charged it, since for some reason it ran out of battery. Didn't work. I then tried bouncing the beam of the cieling to the ufo, no go. I tried launching it from middair, it just fell. Then I charged it again. Seems repetitive, don't it? Then, 5 minutes later, after almost giving up, I tried it, IT ACTUALLY FLEW, and then crushed my hopes by stopping and falling on my face, and then it never worked again. Just so I can prove it wasn't just my ufo, 5 of my friends got the ufo, with similar destructive results. Unless you want to buy a piece of styrofome with a propeller for to much money than its worth, don't even bother getting it. And don't beleive the salesmen at the store that actually use it, they get working tested ones."
2,GREAT FUN WHILE IT LASTED!,"My 7 year old son got it for Christmas. He was really excited. It is definitely a neat toy. The whole family was into it. However, it only lasted one day. It would no longer charge and I am just going to take it back because I am in no position waste $20.00 just for one day."
2,stupid toy,this thing only lasted 3 days!i mean really.i charged it up and it worked fine.but it only lasted about 5 minutes then i had to charge it again.when i looked under it i noticed that stiafom was breaking off!on the 3rd day i charged it up and it never worked again!!!!!!so i went back to toysrus and renturnd the piece of crud.do never buy this toy!!!!!!!!
1,Do NOT Get this!,"you cannot turn the dang thing! and it's not durable at all! if you're getting a gift for someone, don't get this on. it sucks! period!"
5,Really Neat,"I was surprised by all the bad reviews on this toy, I think this is one of the coolest toys I've ever received. The toy is really fun and easy to control, I like that I can fly it in the house too. I think people need to keep in mind that as an ultralight flyer the battery can't be too heavy so it will only last a few minutes. Also it is very important to run down the battery entirely before you charge it or the battery life wil only get shorter. The unit does seem extremely fragile but I have crashed it several times and was surprised by it's durability"
2,indoor toy!,"An important thing to note about this toy is that IT ONLY WORKS INDOORS. I bought the ""National Geographic"" branded version (identical except for box) and the outside packaging said nothing about not working outside. But it doesn't -- the light of an overcast sky is enough to swamp the sensor for the infrared remote. The saucer starts by itself, or refuses to start at all. The manual says in this case ""fly indoors in room with appropriate ceiling height."" Apparently it relies on the light bouncing off the ceiling to read the remote.A flying saucer indoors? Possibly Mom will not appreciate an uncontrollable, randomly flying thing zooming around favorite knick-knacks! You have only a throttle control, no directional control at all. Be aware -- this is for a rec room or play room indoors only."
5,A brilliant study by a brilliant man!,"Dr.Chris Knight was one of my lecturers at university and without fail I would come away from my Anthropology lectures with my head blown away by all the amazing knowledge transfer that occurred. It was all fantastic stuff and all totally confusing until one of those ""aha"" moments, when all of Chris's and the other anthropologists theories suddenly all fell into place and began to make real sense.The book itself was a key text during our studies with various chapters needing to be read at various times. For that reason I shall not break down the book, rather I shall say that it will be one of the most illuminating and eye-opening books that you will ever read. Maybe not the easiest to read but definitely one of the best. Oh, and you can always impress your friends in the pub of an evening with your knowledge of Marxist paleo-anthropological theories pertaining to the emergence of human culture!"
4,Smells REALLY good!,I bought this basket for my sister who LOVED the slippers and raved about the wonderful smelling vanilla lotion. I would but this as a gift again!
2,Bath Set,"I got this from my hubby when he was deployed. God Bless him.I really liked the vanilla body wash and the poofie but that's about it.The shoes where too small,I never use the wooden scrubby thing, but most off all the basket smelled like fresh lacquer.I think I would have liked it a lot more if the basket didn't smell so bad, I had to take it outside the whole house smelled so bad."
2,Over promotes Florida Beaches / Wierd selection.,"Having shot many of the best beaches in Hawaii, California, Florida, The Bahamas, Virgin Islands and the Caribbean, I have been to most of the beaches on his lists. About half of them deserve the awards, the other half has no reason. For example St. George Island has a brownish beach which turns the greenish water into greenish brown. It's rugged and interesting, but not what you'd imagine a 'best' beach to look like. If you really want to see what the best beaches look and feel like, check out the ""Best Beaches"" under DVDs here on Amazon.com."
1,No Great Lakes Beaches? Missing Out on Gorgeous Scenes!,"I won't recommend this book now because I, too, live among the Great Lakes and just visited two or three beautiful beaches yesterday on Lake Michigan. Guess we'll have to write our own book on these gorgeous works of nature! JP"
5,Belongs in every Smalltaker's took kit,"This slim book does not waste any time in giving the essentials to good Smalltalk programming practices. From how to name classes and format your code, to testing tips, you should be able to improve your classes after reading through this book. The guidelines which follow each point are clear and relevant. (My alltime favorite is ""Don't perform brain surgery on yourself""; it refers to modifying the Base System Classes.) This book, along with David Smith's ""Smalltalk The Language"" definitely belongs next to every Smalltalker's PC."
3,Potential to be great...or awful,"When I bought this adventure I was excited to get out of the dungeons and into some more complex schemes and role-playing intead of hack n' slash. After reading it through, I was a bit disapointed.. Not enough city stuff. So I had some fun with it. I took a great many liberties with the plot, encounters, NPCs.. etc.. What was shaping up to be a pretty lame adventure tunrned into three very fine sessions indeed.I am a bit low in the creativity depertment, but once I have a basic framework, I can have a lot of fun as long as I get a good foundation. If you are like that, go ahead and buy this to get a template to work from, but don't run it word for word. Have some fun and throw a few curveballs."
3,"Not a bad story, but a little incomplete","I just ran this adventure for our party. We hadn't done a city adventure before, and they found it to be a very different experience. The story was good enough, though not spectacular, and the action was varied - the party encountered a large number of different challenges.My biggest complaint was that while preparing the adventure, I found it a bit incomplete. Specifically, there are a couple characters that aren't described in the appendix, so I had to fill in some stats on my own. It's not that this was hard work, but having bought the module, I expected it to be complete."
2,Not up to par with the others,"This is really not very good because it doesn't save you any work. That is the whole purpose of modules... DMs trade in cash for planning time. In fact, I had to do TONS of planning to make up for the holes in this plot... not to mention that the villain makes very little sense. I have never understood the desire of someone to conquer a boring, undesireable little town. What the module really boils down to is a cleverly disguised linear (thats right... linear) adventure, that clever players can suffer from. If players figure out what is going on too quickly, they can be in over their heads just as quickly. I have never had to do so much player protecting in my 10 years of DMing, not even in the Tomb of Horrors. Bottom line: you can come up with something better than this and that you UNDERSTAND, otherwise, you don't need to run games."
3,"The Main ""Event""","I'd tried in the past to create my own event- or story-based adventures, and have failed. Site- or encounter-based adventures seem to be easier for me, but they're lacking in complexity and sometimes in plot.This module was my first encounter with a real event-based adventure. While it wasn't spectacular, it wasn't bad, either. In fact, if nothing else, running this adventure may help teach a DM how to run an event-based adventure. The encounters can be used in different orders, and there's what basically amounts to a flow chart to hold the whole thing together. The story is a little weak at times, but the NPCs are intriguing, and the encounters are interesting and challenging .While my favorite will still be the site-based adventure, this is an example of a decent event-based adventure."
1,missing dust cover,"The book was advertised to be in very good condition. It was missing the jacket and had writing inside. I would not rate this ""very good"" condition."
5,Makes me cry everytime,I love this book. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is so sweet and somehow so touching. I get choked up every time I read it to my kids. I highly recommend it as a part of any families library.
5,This is a CLASSIC!,"This book has such an unexpected gut-level impact on everyone who reads it! I have read it aloud to people of all ages and there is never a dry eye in the room! Each of the short letters begins with a date which will be meaningful to anyone who lived through the depression. Oddly enough, disasters and hard times seem to bring out the best in people and this book sets out to show just how that is true. Lydia Grace Finch is such a universally loveable little character - she is unforgettable! The text and the illustrations are so perfectly suited to each other - they seem to have been created by the same person -but they aren't! (Just a ""marriage of true minds"" I guess.)The book gets at the heart of what a family can give a child even without money - what it means to be poor and what it means to be rich.This is a lovely gift book for children or adults and I hope it stays in print for a long, long time!"
5,"Tear-jerker, a bit old for most kids though","I read this through three times before handing it over begrudgingly to my niece and her cousin. She's 4 and the cousin is 5. Most of it went right over her head, but the 5-year old seemed to pick up on the plot a little. It really grows with re-reads, so if your child really likes to hear the same story over and over again, there's enough detail and complexity to not bore you to death. A cute idea of regenerating a inner city building in disrepair, and coming out of the depression with hope and love. I think it reads well on both levels - there's a surface story that kids can get into and more interesting elements for adults."
5,This is a wonderful book!,"I absolutely love this book! My 5 year old son and I planted a garden this year and I wanted to find a book that helped to reinforce the concept of gardening as not only fun but as a way of bringing beauty and joy into people's lives. I found it with this book. In fact, I read it several times by myself before even reading it to my son and, even after numerous readings, the ending never fails to bring tears to my eyes. I've also been sharing this story with my adult friends and it has touched each one."
5,Students' Review,"The book the gardener is a great book to read. It is about a girl that visits her uncle in the city and makes a secret place and loves plants. The secret place is full of plants. She sends letters to her family, then she goes home. I give the book 5 stars. It's a great book!O & K Third Graders"
5,Awesome!,this product has substantially clearned my skin. I've noticed an improvement in less than a week. I use it on my whole face once a week and then spot treat as needed. Well worth the cost!
5,"Smells Good, Feels Great, Doesn't Irritate my skin","I was hesitant about using this product because of the sulfur. Typically sulfur doesn't agree with me, and I am not a fan of the smell, HOWEVER after buying this product by mistake, I tried it, and I LOVE it. It smells like eucalyptus not sulfur and it does not irritate my skin. I only put a thin layer on, not a generous amount like directed. It dries quickly and washes off cleanly. I leave it on for no more than 5 minutes. If you put a thick layer on it takes much longer to dry and I don't think it makes a difference. The small amount I put on has the same effect. It makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. I have oily/acne prone skin and this product definitely helps and doesn't dry it out. I am a sold on this stuff!!"
3,Not what I expected.,The smell is repugnant & it really lasts no mattter how much I tried to wash away the smell. Honestly I did not find the product to be any better than the over the counter masks you can buy at any local drugstore.
1,Why the parabens?,There are better sulfur products out there that are paraben free. There is no need to slather that dangerous stuff on your skin.
5,Bought it for my nephew,"I bought these for my nephew in Florida. He asked for the 22R set the day after I purchased it, but this pair will work for him, and my brother was happy with them for him."
4,pure epic-goth fun,"This isn't deep; this is just plain old video-game-soundtrack style fun. It's like New-Age ""wallpaper"" music for evil sorcerers. Mortiis may be a ridiculous attention-grabbing clown who sold out and made dance music later in his career, but that doesn't detract one whit from the noises that come out of your cd player when you put this thing in it. And those noises are some that you can listen to all day. Mortiis was a big fan of the legendary Conan the Barbarian movie soundtrack, as is anybody with any sense who enjoys this kind of music, but unlike the rest of the Basil-wannabes, he actually had the talent to pull this kind of thing off. It's not Conan, but it's really good, and whether you're a gothic vampire nerd or a dungeon-crawling dragon-slaying wizard nerd, you'll love this, since it's about halfway between the two."
3,Miller Works Best On A Vast Canvas,"This collection of novelist Sue Miller's short stories, some pre-dating any of her longer fiction, are a mixed lot and all tend toward explorations of love's more dismal hemisphere. Be forewarned, if you read this anthology you cross into frequently depressing territory. Only the title story about a now middle-aged man's recounting of his older brother's affairs with three sisters in the 1950's, carries any real weight or lingers in the memory. Fans of Miller's novels, like the masterful suburban tragedy, Family Pictures, or the dark morality play, Lost In The Forest, might like to read this simply to round-out their experience with this author, but for those who appreciate how much can be done with the short story art form might be mildly disappointed, as was I."
3,The stars rated have nothing against the service provided.,The item arrived quickly. Service was excellent. The product unfornately was not what I was quite expecting. It does however make for an interesting read. I think it may be the first time I prefer watching the movie over reading the story.
1,Disappointing & Depressing,"I am glad I picked this up off a sale table & didn't pay a lot of money for it. I have not read any of her other books, but this one was a waste of my time. The title story was the best one and it went downhill from there. The stories were disappointing &/or disgusting &/or irritating. I kept waiting for something more to them and they fell flat. Perhaps there was a hidden meaning? Well, it was too well hidden! This book went into my recycling bin and the waste mgmt. people took it away!"
5,Beautiful and simple Vase,This is one of those simple beauties. Perfect size for any table and really eye catching without being too over the top.This is really a great piece of crystal and worth every penny.
2,disappointed,"Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book. Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility.The title says ""interpreting"" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution."
3,"Pernice unplugged - strange album, only for fans","From the uninspired CD name, to having tracks 2 and 3 switched, to having the final track spelled differently than the original, to being a live CD without an audience, this is one oddball CD. The Pernice Bros were already unplugged enough, their sound did not need further mellowing. Even soft instruments like pianos and strings are ditched in favor of acoustic guitars, and the music suffers as a result. Get their excellent World Won't End and Yours... CD's instead."
4,A fine sampling of Pernice Brothers,"This EP includes songs from the Pernice Brothers' Overcome By Happiness and The World Won't End CDs. For the most part these songs are similar to the original recordings except with less instrumentation. ""All I Know"" is sans piano and adds acoustic guitars which give it a more cheerful (or slightly less depressing at least) sound. A sort of bar room sing/mope along version.. I would buy it for that track only, plus ""Dimmest Star"" has some great electric guitar which stands out more on this version than on the original. This CD is a good introduction to the Pernice Brothers music if you are hesitant on buying their full length CDs or are unsure which to start with."
2,Not the most invigorating adaptations,"This video trilogy is a set of live theatrical performances taped up in Canada of three of Shakespeare's more familiar works: ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" ""As You Like It,"" and ""Romeo & Juliet."" Unfortunately, they are not the most LIVELY theatrical performances I have encountered.The productions are sound, and obviously ably directed. But that doesn't fully counteract the fact that, especially for two of Shakespeare's sillier comedies, they just aren't played very funny. This particular production company obviously went for a deep artistic production rather than audience-friendly entertainment. Which is too bad, for I like all three plays when they are done well and captivating.These are NOT the videos to buy if you're hoping to foster a love for Shakespeare in new-comer junior high students, which is what I was hoping for when I bought them."
1,"Low quality construction, broken in a month","At first use, cd burned fine & read fine. After travelling by airplane, with cd burner packed in hand luggage (i.e. carry-on) and well packed (wrapped in thick sweater, put in middle of bag), cd would not burn (would not recognize blank CD-R on insertion), and would not read pre-written cds. It does, however, still read DVDs, but that is all.This is presumably a consequence of poor quality design & construction; design looks slick, but in such a slim package, the components must not have been solidly secured. Recall also reading Amazon reviews of Lacie Porsche designed hard drives experiencing similar complete hardware failures."
1,"Cheap, slow, flimsy.","I needed an external optical drive that my Toshiba M200 would recognize as a boot disk. For my needs, this was the only name-brand drive I could buy from a reputable dealer with fast shipping in the $100 range. The reason these are still in stock is because they are a shoddy, terrible product.The place where you lock on the disk inside is razor-thin, the drive is noisy and ugly, and using it as boot disk for XP only worked after a nail-biting second try. I'll be gently packing this back in it's box and storing it in my closet for the next time I need a boot disk (hopefully never).As far as a sleek, plug and play external USB optical drive that is sturdy and fast, I recommend the Sony DRX-S70U. Too bad I can't use it as a boot disk though!"
1,Bad news -- Cannot boot from this device,"I bought this drive for my Fujitsu P1510D Tablet PC which does not have an internal CDROM, and thus requires an external CDROM to reinstall the operating system. The Fujitsu supports booting from an external USB CDROM, but after being unable to boot from this device, I was informed by LaCie Tech Support that this CDROM does not support booting from it! There was no disclosure of this limitation in the sales literature or user guide. I am going to try to get my money back. It ticks me off that one has to think like a lawyer to keep from getting shafted by so many corporations these days."
3,Nice player BUT,"This is an excellent player, with many nice features. The screen is sharp but, and this is a very big but, the viewing angles are so narrow as to render this almost unusable and is really unacceptable in today's world of LCD screens. It's a shame because the unit is well-designed and well-made. The inclusion of Component and S-Video outputs allows you to use it as player with larger screens which is a major plus but not enough to negate the narrow viewing angles. If the only way you plan on using it is sitting still on an airplane for several hours, you'll be happy. If you move around, or want to put it in the back seat of your minivan for 2 kids to watch, this is not the one for you-or them."
3,Plays MPG files nicely,"The main reason I purchased this player was to have a portable dvd player that has the ""divx"" playback feature (not mentioned in the US literature), but you can read about it at DIVX.com. It won't play .avi files, you have to rename them to .mpg to play them. So far I've been able to play mpeg1, mpeg2, mpeg4, xivd, divx encoded files. The player features are better than average. The remote is nice. The whole unit feels a little on the cheap side. I've had no real issues yet. I like this one better than my go-video player (it has a smaller lcd, at a lower resolution)"
3,To Short for my liking,This is a nice coloring book but it is very short. I'm sure they canafford to put in some extra pages.
2,"Cute, but flimsy and not that pretty","I ordered this charm as part of a birthday gift of a charm bracelet for a friend in Minneapolis, along with two other charms. My friend wears the bracelet daily, but has opted to wear the single Tiffany heart charm I included, and I agree the bracelet looks better that way.This charm is cute, a novelty, but not of great quality, and not particularly pretty."
4,The Commander's Greatest Tunes!,"This disc compiles some of the best material from Cody's releases with Relix. This ""best of"" surpasses any other 'best of' collection you may find because on this release, the songs are delightfully raw and, in some cases, definative live versions. If you are a Cody fan, you should be buying the individual Cody albums, but if a 'best of' is what you want, this RELIX 'best of' captures Cody in a raw form with most of his greatest songs."
3,"Good Info, Bad Style","I love Wayne Shorter, and listen to him every day, so I'm eager for any bit of information regarding his life/music. However, on a purely literary level, this book reads more like a fan club manifesto than a critical biography, which is what I was hoping for. At times it seems that the author just throws a bunch of anecdotes together. Other times, she's struggling to understand Shorter's abstract remarks and unusual syntax. In short, this biography never really gets past the ""daily journal"" level of writing.Basically, I would recommend buying this book purely for the information rather than the reading experience."
3,Worthwhile for some but falls short,"The book has value in letting us learn more about this fascinating man and the things he's done and even sometimes why he did them that way. Unfortunatly this reads as a ""fan"" type book with the author inadvertently showing that she hasn't really ""lived"" with the music in an in depth way. There are a handful of trite and naive statements throughout the book that any true lover of Wayne or ""Jazz"" would find a little sickening. If you want to know more about Wayne then you have to buy this because it's all that is out there beside his wonderful music but overall a missed opportunity to do something really fine on a very interesting individual."
1,None of the original artists!,NONE of these great songs are actually by the artists you know & remember. Don't get fooled by these HORRID remakes of songs.
2,Not meant for the professional,"To say I was dissapointed is an understatement. This is definitely a laymans book. I had wanted a book for reference but this is about as non-specific as you can get. If you are a massage therapist, you do not want this book."
5,ET2000 and seller credits,The product and the seller are of the best quality possible and J&R Music and Computer World give fast service and are the most helpful/caring people I've had the pleasure of dealing with! Thank You
3,works well but...,"after about a month,the ear piece keeps coming off in my pocket. after going though two....the part that hangs on the ear broke off. over all,would not buy again."
5,Prostate Cancer by Centeno and Onik,"Prostate cancer involves clusters of cells which grow out of control. Biopsies measure the incidence of cancer with minimum risk. Standard therapies are radiation, hormonal and cryosurgery.As we get older, less testosterone is produced. The reducedtestosterone levels may cause the prostrate to shrink in mass.Cryosurgery freezes tissue. The current state of prostate surgeryart is on ""afud"", ""prostatecancerfoundation"" and ""urologyhealth""coms. This work would be invaluable if you have prostrate problems and it will be necessary to choose an optimal treatment modality.This volume is well worth the price charged for the information content alone. It is well-researched and the sources are authoritative."
5,Music for the soul...,I can't really explain to you how the music will make you feel. It seems Ryan has a way to capture many feelings in different songs. Sometimes I close my eyes and I can see what I'm hearing..not sure if that makes sense to you or not..but I'm taken somewhere and the songs do a wonderful job of imagining bliss and relaxation..very soothing. Awesome job Ryan and keep up the great work!
4,pretty nice!,"This was a great costume, except the netting on the wig could have been fastened more securely."
2,came ripped,"The robe came all ripped up where the robe attaches to the hood. Not a quality product. The rest was fine, and looks fine, but I would expect a new in package item to not be ripped."
2,Poor quality,"The quality of this item was poor, even for a costume in a bag. The seams on each side of the dress were several inches different in length and the fabric cuts were jagged/ripped-looking. The material was very low quality and thin - but that's almost to be expected from a costme in a bag. Also, the belt was too large, even at the smallest velcro connection. I wasn't expecting high quality, but at almost $50, I was expecting better."
1,Very Let down,"I bought this item for my wife to wear to celibration V. Once we receved it we relized the fabric is cheap, the wig is byond cheap. And I won't even start on the quality of the belt. This product is not worth the money that they are asking for it. Don't buy it. Make your own."
5,BEST COSTUME EVER!,I LOVED THIS COSTUME!!THE WIG IS NOT SO GREAT....IT WAS A GOOD THING I HAD A LOT OF MY OWN HAIR TO MAKE THE LEIA BUNS. BUT THE DECISION TO BE LEIA IS ONE YOU WILL NOT REGRET. (ALSO THE BOOT COVERS ARE NOT GREAT..I DID NOT USE THOSE EITHER) YOU WILL WANT TO PURCHASE A STAR WARS BLASTER GUN AS WELL. THEY MAKE THEM WITH NOISES AND LIGHTS....IT WILL COMPLETE YOUR OUTFIT....YOU WILL BE......LEIA.
4,Could've Used Michael,"Don't get me wrong. The Doobies have shown from the very beginning that they can play, put on a great show and improve your mood just by hearing them. One reviewer described the show (paraphrasing) as a relief not to endure the ""insufferable, castrated vocals of Michael McDonald"". Let me clue you in, Mac. For as much as Tommy Johnston should be credited for the Doobies' sound, so should Michael. That said, the Doobies are one of the few surviving Rock bands to maintain their integrity and not become a complete shadow of their former selves. I happen to feel that a void was left when Michael departed."
4,"Good Stuff, But...","...I've got to agree with some of the other reviewers re: over-use of the horn section. It would be fine if they were used occasionally, but just because you have a horn section there doesn't mean you have to use them ON EVERY SONG. That being said, the video quality, sound and performances are excellent - especially the vocals."
4,A must for any Doobie Fan,"I have mixed feelings about the horns and sax. The talent is very impressive but is a questionable addition to the songs from the past which did not include horns or sax. I would have bought the DVD alone for ""Another Park, Another Sunday"" which is my favorite song of all time! Talk about a great 45 single! For those of you who remember wax, side A was Another Park and side B was Black Water. I can't think of any other 70s band that had such a wide range of musical talent. I mean...I like Boston too but all their music sounded the same after a while! :-)"
1,Doobie Brothers: Live at the Wolf Trap,"I ordered this DVD through Amazon, clearly indicating that I'm a German citizen and that the product would be used in my country. The delivery time was quite OK and the product arrived brand new and sealed. However, this DVD can not be played/used on any DVD-player here in Germany. We have 4 of them at home - it just doesn't work. I tried those at my friend's homes - no way. This is pretty disappointing and I will send the DVD back and ask for a refund. At the same time I ordered the CD ""Live at Wolf Trap"" - which is just great !"
1,This really sucks,"There is nothing worse than going to a concert and watching old guys play their old hits in slightly different ways. So, why would I sit at home and do it? My love of live performance DVD's is derived from not being able to see shows of older bands in their prime. This is not what I call entertainment."
4,"Like the Eagles, the Doobie Brothers have still got it.","If you enjoyed the Doobies in the sixties and seventies, you will surely enjoy this concert. Good music and quality, and overall great value. Dan"
5,Wish I had been at the concert...,"This is very well done! The guys were really on the night this was filmed - even though you later learn there was a minor flub at the beginning. They played well, sang well and looked like they were really enjoying giving the performance. Pat and Tom especially look like they are enjoying it.If you are a Doobie fan this is a must own."
3,Doobies do wolftrap,This dvd has great visuals as it should for being shot in this location. The sound is tight for the instruments but Tom Johnston's voice is lost on most of his lead vocals. The mix does not pick up his voice clearly on all tracks but the harmonies are great. The only other thing that bothered me on this dvd is the pausing and introductions between songs. 3.5 stars!
1,Save Your Money,"The book that these flash cards were based on, ""A Whack on the Side of the Head"" is great book on problem solving and creativity. These cards are not. Save your money or spend it on another book on the topic from another author, such as ""Conceptual Blockbusting - A Guide to Better Ideas""."
2,"Don't Bother, Very Mediocre","I ordered this and sent it back. I've looked for a lot of creativity tools for high tech innovations and medical solutions. This pack of cards was not helpful. I did find one set of cards that is fantastic, and its the IDEO Method Cards set, but they are not available through Amazon. They lend a number of methods for analyzing user behavior, usage patterns and twists on rethinking product design. Fantastic!"
4,From Basic to Exotic,"This is an excellent book for the novice or the practiced preserver. Lesem begins her book with a summary of the equipment needed, a clear description of the basic techniques, and a market guide to buying and storing fresh produce. Then the fun begins. I have tried the basics--Apple Butter (made in a slow cooker--Yum!), Strawberry Preserves and Quick Dill Slices--and the exotic--Pickled Snap Peas and Fresh Green Chutney with Chinese Parsley and Yogurt. So far, SUCCESS! Now, I'm looking forward to trying Jalapeno Lime Marmalade, Tomato Peach Jam and Green Tomato Ketchup. The recipes are clear and often accompanied by an amusing or interesting anecdote. Helpful hints are scattered throughout the book. And the really good news is that most of these recipes are for small quantities, many 2 or 3 cups of finished product. There is also a chapter about microwave preserving, what works, what doesn't."
5,If you want to make wonderful jams & jellies...,"...then this is the book for you. First of all, this cookbook has probably the most amazingly good recipe for strawberry jam I've ever found. Right there, it's worth the price of the book. Her spicy blueberry jam with spices like cinnamon & cloves is what I'd call an ""adult jam"". Almost a chutney.Jeanne gives you a large collection of commercial-pectin-free recipes that end up giving you a better flavor and contain quite a bit less sugar. She encourages you to think in terms of small, quality batches as opposed to the 15-quart batches my grandmother used to turn out.I've liked this book so much, I've given something like 8 copies of it away to friends who came whining around looking for more jam. Now all of us are happily making jam."
4,clear and easy to understand,"About the only thing I don't like about this book is that it focuses pretty hard on freezing some things rather than canning them, as though freezer space couldn't possibly be at a premium. However, other than that detail this is a tremendously informative book that is well-written and simple to read. I especially like that the author focuses on how microwaving can dramatically cut down on the prep time for some of the preserving recipes in this book, and when it doesn't work so well."
4,classic,"The episodes are what I recall seeing when I was a kid. It is a good series. Despite the scenes of self defense, it is a good series for the kids to learn patience and good values. Product was delivered on time."
3,ok,Nothing really special to say about the book. I ordered it as part of a course I was talking online. It is well written and had some interesting material in it. I remains on my bookshelf at work as a reference guide when needed.
5,Jorma Kaukonen Christmas,"Super fast delivery.Excellent condition. Great artist!(for those of you who don't recognize the name, think J.Airplane, Hot Tuna) Great songs! & an autographed label! What more could you ask for?"
5,Good service,Package arrived on time and just as discribed thanks for the great service. would shop here again with no worries.
3,A good challenge!!,"Ok-so am I proficient in Nepali? NO! Did I learn some vocabulary words? Yes. Did I come to understand some grammar? Yes. And I guess that is what I got most from it-- that when I hear others speaking Nepali, I can pick out a few words that I know--whether they are talking about themselves, or someone else. And that can be important sometimes. This is not a book that you read, it is one that you study. It takes alot of committment if you actually want to learn it because it teaches you to write the letters also (which I did learn). I am sure if anyone can try to devote some time to it, you could learn it pretty well--it is well constructed. And the TAPE...well that was the most important so you can understand the pronunciation."
2,Not what I thought,I wanted to try something natural hoping it would not bother my skin. This product is not a cream at all it is super thick and does not go on smoothly. I felt like I was tugging at my skin just to get it to smear on my face. I woke up the next day and had a pimple. This is not for sensitve skin.
3,Evening Primrose,"""The large, slightly fragrant yellow flowers of the Evening Primrose, a member of the Willow family, are unusually in that they open during the twilight hours of 6:00 - 7:00 PM, hence their name 'evening' primrose. When pressed, seeds from the flowers yield oil high in Vitamin E and the essential fatty acid Omega-6. These anti-oxidants counteract the formation of free radicals, associated with the aging process, and help promote cell regeneration and skin repair."""
3,Swivel wheels stopped swivelling,"I got these wheels for my mother and she loved them at first. Gradually they stopped swivelling properly and she had to kick them with her foot to get them to go in the proper direction. I thought it was operator error, so I tried them. Same result. I ended up taking them off and putting her stationary ones on again. I still have them in the hopes that I might experiment and figure out how to make them behave properly again. Maybe some oil?"
3,wd40 needed,"Had to lubricate the swivel and adjust to make sure they were the same height before they worked for my mom. After those adjustments, they're ok. Still don't swivel as easily as an older set on dad's walker, but better than the straightline wheels that were on the walker!"
1,unsafe walker wheels,THe sets of wheels I have order were defective. The replacement wheels were from same lot # and they were defective also. I think some one in quality control was asleep when this batch of wheels went through. I am very displeased with this product. I purchased these wheels from two different places and was given wheels from the same batch. Both sets of wheels worked for about a week before they started hanging up and caused a major fall risk.
4,Wonderful,Thank you for the book of shadows however I did not realize that it would not come looking like the book that I saw. Instead I recieved one with a God on the front that I do not adhere to. Please be more thourough on your descriptions in the future.
4,Good for Red Sox fans.,Good official films of both World Series seasons. Great for any Red Sox fan. Blue Ray transfer not perfect but decent for price.
3,2004 and 2007 a World Series films.,"Well I can't say I hate this, but I feel like the blu-ray could definitely have more. The blu-ray includes and is limited to only the 2004 and 2007 World Series films. Don't get me wrong, I think the World Series films are great and enjoy them very much but I feel like the blu-ray is a little bare and is just an attempt to make more money. I thought maybe this would be a new documentary or something but its only two World Series films. If you don't own the 04 or 07 World Series films or if you're a diehard Red Sox fan (which btw i am not, i am a diehard Yankees fan) than maybe I would recommend this to you."
4,deabur amla hair oil,i got about an inch of hair growth with this product...i liked it alot. and i will purchase again in the future.
5,Wonderful,I received this item quickly...no skips or any problems playing it...was a great movie... everything about this was well handled...what a great transaction to boot!!
5,Nice family movie,"Of course our favorite dog is back in action, the plot entails boy finding dog..takes him home..dad who is single dad trains animals for tv..dad does not want dog..soon dog becomes new star..All in all not a bad way to spend few hours bonding with your kids, just remember do not allow them to talk you into gettin a Beethoven of their own."
3,They're Still Messin' With My Childhood!!!,"As a kid, I grew up with the first two Beethoven movies! In my opinion, they are the only worthwhile films in the 'series' I was confused as to what this is supposed to be. Is is the 6th film and a writer happens to guess everything that happened in the original classic, or is it a prequel that shows how the first was made. It does have some cute and funny moments, and I liked Cesar Millan's cameo. Eddie is an animal trainer, but he doesn't want anything to do with dogs. His son, Billy runs into Beethoven and he wants to keep him. Soon, Beethoven gets a part in a movie based on his life from the original. I'd probably recommend BEETHOVEN'S BIG BREAK!!!"
5,works on saab 900s,"I bought this cable to replace the ""self-adjusting"" Saab cable after the most recent one broke. It's working like a charm one month later; time will tell if it holds up any better than the Saab part. My mechanic thought it was a good idea, because adjusting it will be easier than manipulating the self-adjusting one. The price on Amazon was far less than the usual discount auto parts sites, too."
1,rash,honestly the only thing this product did was give me a rash where i would place it. did not continue to use so i cant really review on wat it does other than that.
5,Greatest book ever,"It was very good, it was so different from the stories that I have heard. I loved the book very much."
4,Incredible,I saw this guy open for RatDog back in '96 and bought this disk the next day.It was stolen a year later but the songs have been stuck in my head for years. I just purchased it from amazon and cant wait to get it on my Ipod.
1,Not Vegetarian,"The text mentions a ""vegetarian source"" of omega-3 fatty acids. These capsules contain gelatin. The product description is misleading. I now have to return what I ordered.I was required to enter a rating. I would have given it zero stars if I had been allowed."
3,Very little on existentialism - too much on Sartre,"_Introducing Sartre_ is an interesting concept: use the format of a graphic novel to expound on the ideas of one of the 20th century's greatest minds. Unfortunately, the concept falls flat in execution.I won't go into detail about the relative merits (or not) of the artwork. The book, however, left much to be desired. It is essentially a biography of Jean - Jacques Sartre, with only cursory attention paid to existentialism as a philosophy. Admittedly the two are related, but I had really hoped for a closer and deeper examiniation of his ideas - instead I got medicore biography.If a summary of Sartre's life is of interest, this would be a great place to begin. If, however, you are looking for information about his ideas, go elsewhere."
3,"Good bio, bad philosophy","Just as a previous reviewer stated, this book focuses too much on the biographical Sartre, and not enough on the philosophical Sartre. The pictures don't really add much to the text either. If you are looking for an intro to Sartre's life, this book is adequate, but if you want to learn about his philosophy, then you should look elswhere."
4,"One small, but important flaw","The product is great, great colors, design and material....but once inflated you need to do something to keep it in the right position, as it will end up nose up."
2,air leaks out within an hour,"like the design, but the air/Helium whatever we fill, leaks out in less than an hour. It is $4 so time to repack and ask for refund etc. (whole procedure) is likely less ROI."
1,Don't waste your money on this video,This is the worst quality video ...... It was like watching someones homemade video.Don't waste your money on this video...
3,nostalgia,"I purchased this video for the scenery, because I know the area and miss it. The scenery never disappoints, narrative and comment is pedestrian."
5,Great fun CD !,"I just bought this for my grandaughters ages 2 1/2 and 3 yrs old for Christmas with their Sing a long CD players and I know the girls and their parents are going to love it. From listening to the samples online, I love the varied music and fun way the songs are sung. Our family loves to be sing, laugh and be crazy - these will get listened to a lot. I also love the lullabies on the 3rd CD."
3,not thrilled with presentation,"I have ordered 100 Toddler Favorites 3 CD set recently. My grandson (14- months) loves the songs especially the ones sung by little children and I have to play them in my car whenever we are driving someplace.I did have a problem when I was trying to download the CDs into my I Tunes,discs #1 and 2 were OK and had all the correct information but songs on disc # 3 were only identified as Track 1, Track 2, Track 3. Is there an explanation for this or is there some sort of unprofessional copying going on here ???? I had to type all the information into I Tunes myself. Be forewarned."
4,Toddler loves it,"My 18 months old have to listen to these CDs for a couple hours every day for the past couple of months now. Sound quality could be better, but for that price, value is hard to beat."
2,"Lots of quantity, but bad quality.","This CD set was a serious disappointment. No wonder it was so inexpensive. My toddler was annoyed with the adult and child voices in most of the songs, and I was sad to hear many of the traditional song words changed. In total, only a handful of the songs are fun and enjoyable. Too bad--if done well, this group of songs would be a great collection."
1,The stuff that gives kids' music a bad name.,"ACompilation of many old favorites a annoyingly sung. After less than half way through one side, I had to stop. The adult singers are awful; words are changed to no good effect. I've got a pretty high tolerance for kid music, but this stank!"
1,not our cup of tea,"we were disappointed with this cd. overacting by the adults on many of the songs. they insist on making a song their own and many times louse it up. no real child like quality - the message seemed to be 'listen to my funny accent, my unique interpretation of this song'. too many sound effects."
5,I need it for my pre-k classroom!,"This is the fifth time I am buying this collection. I find it indispensible in my pre-k classroom. I use it so much that the CDs get scratched up. It is obviously old, but for me that is good, because that means it does not consist of bad synthesizer music, or bad child singing as I have found so many modern recordings to be annoying. I bought it because the title list was useful, but I was happily surprised that the songs were recorded in a quality manner. I am ordering another set right now, just got sidetracked to this review. My only problem is, that the listing of the songs in the jewel case is innacurate. There are different editions, and you can only trust the play list on the individual CD's. So, here I am, buying this again, for the fifth time, that is how useful it is to me. School is starting in two weeks, and I need to buy this AGAIN!"
3,It is not as good as I have thought to be and the cover was broken,The songs are OK. But I have got disappointed about the service quality. The cover was broken when I recieved it. Before I bought it I had listened to the sample songs which were fine. Although I don't like the way they sang the other ones.
5,Great seat,"My 6 year old loves this seat. It is substantial, well made and well designed. He is a large child (100th percentile) and finds it very comfortable. Well worth the price."
5,Quality booster!,"I recently purchased 2 of these seats for my children ages 6 and 4 for a second vehicle. The seats are very well made, with quality materials. We took the seats on the their first plane trip, and they were very easy to fold. I also purchased the carrying case. This made it very easy for travel. I really like the folding feature, and my kids like armrests and cup holders. I would definetly purchase again."
4,The Works of P. B. Shelley.,"This is an excellent collection of one of the English languages classic poets. Recommended to anyone seeking an entryway to some of the finest English literature ever written. The Essays are easier to understand than the poetry, but the poetry is magnificent exercise for the brain."
3,Typical Mike Mepham style,"Just like his Sudoku books; 4 levels of difficulty - Gentle, Moderate, Tough and Diabolical.All of the puzzles make you ""use your noodle"". I have yet to complete one of his puzzles, although some other Kakuros give me no difficulty solving.One thing this book has going for it is a primer on solving Kakuro."
1,Don't bother,"This book is such a poor example of an edited puzzle book. Our family does daily kakuro and sudoku puzzles from the paper or other sources. The ""gentle"" make you think so hard that that it's NO FUN. Don't think anyone tried them before the book was published."
2,Didn't enjoy it much,"I read other reviews before ordering, and I wanted a bit of a challenge instead of the many Kakuro books that have puzzles so easy you hardly have to think. Like said earlier, all puzzles are hard, even the ""easy"" ones. One puzzle was repeated. Often there didn't seem to be a logical way to find solutions, so I got there by trail and error, and then the crappy paper (erasing) is no fun, also because some times it seemed that I had for instance found a ""1"" somewhere to later realize it had pressed through from the puzzle on the other side. Anyway, all in all I just didn't enjoy these puzzles very much. I like a bit harder puzzles, love the Mensa book and the Black Belt Kakuro is good too, but this one, no fun. I stumbled through it because I can't find many other Kakuro books, thinking this was better than nothing, but I can't recommend this book. New Kakuro fans skip it, experienced ones can try it if they've run out of better books."
5,Great book for the avid Kakuro/Cross Sums fan...,"I was very pleasantly surprised that the 1st puzzle (Gentle) I started was a challenge, actually had to put my numbers into the box to finish the puzzle. I am so used to the easy puzzles taking a minute, that it was nice to get my money's worth from this book. If you want something you can breeze through, this book might not be it; but if you want a book that gives you some challenging gratification, this book rocks! I simply can't put it down! If you are a Kakuro addict, this is a must have issue..."
1,Not a book for beginners,"I first got hooked on Kakuro from an inexpensive paperback so I decided to upgrade to a higher quality book. I found that all the puzzles in this book are difficult, even the ones designated as ""easy"". For someone with experience solving difficult Kakuro puzzles, this book is challanging. However, if you are a beginner, you will become frustrated trying to solve the first puzzle and might not ever want to try another."
3,Very Basic,I'm a new beekeeper and I think this DVD is just to basic.......Buy Beekeeping for dummies...you will learn a lot more
3,Great introduction to a little-known period,"This is a collection of music from Andalusian Spain and gives a charming introduction to Christian, Muslim and Jewish popular and sacred tunes."
3,He has real feel for the music,You have to know the blues to really understand jazz music. That's why it makes sense for Edgar to cross over. You can tell he has real feel for the music.
2,Oh No,"not at all what I would expect from Edgar Winter, and I mean that in the worst possible way. I enjoy Jazz, I don't enjoy what were great songs turned into musak."
4,Kool Kingfish Live in NYC,"This CD is a must have for any Matthew Kelly fan.The evening must have been really fun and can be heard in recording.The only reason I didn't give this 5 STARS, is because mix in the sound board recording was slightly off.When most of these songs were recorded,lead guitar had more of an emphasis.All in all it was a very Kool Show and wish I had been there.This was one of the few local shows that got by me.Pick this CD up you'll enjoy it!"
3,"Nice design, but doesn't quite get it done.","This razor is beautifully designed and feels great in the hand, but-- for my face -- it didn't wack off all of the wiskers under the jaw bone, a tough place to shave clean..."
1,electronics flaky after some time,"After some use, the shaver was not reliable in its electronics. It turned off in the middle of using it, or sometimes it would not run at full strength even it was just charged. It gets annoying after a while."
4,Wet shaver works,"Just started using the Panasonic Linear wet/dry shaver. Works great. Instructions said it might take 30 days to get used to it. I got a great shave the first time and there is no more ""break-in"" period needed. A fine product."
2,"close shave left nicks, and missed hairs","95% impressive close, fast shave...BUT after 25days of wet and dry shaving, the shaver left nicks. Never had an electric shaver draw blood before! And it still had difficulty with ""sideways neck hairs."" What's the advantage of fast shave if after finishing most of the job in a minute, you're stuck fussing over some hairs that lay down flat under the foil. This might be a good shaver for fast growing thick staight up beards but for all the slow growing scraggly cantankerous eccentric beards out there... you might do better with a quadra three head Norelco."
2,Can't compare with Norelco,"Compared with Norelco's, the Panasonic shaver was disappointing:1. The shaves are not as close on men with medium beards2. As a stiff foil shaver, it does not contour around bony areas, such as the chin, as well as the floating, rotating heads on the Norelco.3. The shaver leaves the stubbles of your beard in your sink, making for a messy daily clean-up.I had high expectations with Panasonic's claim of such high RPM's of blade movement. Unfortunately, the quality of the shave is limited by the foil design. Even higher RPM's would not fix its weaknesses."
5,Best shaver I ever owned,I've had Remington. Norelco and Braun but this Panasonic ES8003W beats them all. The wet shave and easy clean up make shaving almost a pleasure
3,Convenient but not as close as a blade,"Although I'm happy with my purchase, and I will continue using this razor, it was a bit less than my expectations. It's very convenient, and much faster to shave with this versus a regular blade, but the shave is definitely not as close. My first reaction was to try and stretch and prod my face to get the shave to be as close as possible, but it's pretty much a waste of time. The good news is there was no irritation with this razor at all.In comparison with the norelco quadra-action lift-and-cut razor, which I have also used, the norelco gives a much closer shave however is a little rough on my face. The nape of my neck never really got adjusted to the norelco even after 30 days of use. However the panasonic was much faster at completing the shave as the norelco needed many more passes to pick up all of the hairs."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this Panasonic thinking it would be far superior to any others as I am a long time Panasonic user. Got the shaver and used it for a few days and found it didn't cut as close as my previous Panasonics that were even cheaper. Figured I would give it a couple of weeks just to make sure my beard would adjust, but no improvement was noticed. Unfortunately, I feel I have to send this model back and try something else. I just don't believe this shave lives up to it's ""hype""."
3,A slightly disappointing sequel,The story of how Geno and Guri learn the harshness as well as pleasures of life in the woods doesn't seem to ring as true as the earlier story of their father's growth and learning.Man is less menacing and an effort is made to distinguish harmful from helpful men.The characters are slightly less realisic.When Salten wrote this book(while the movie was in progress of being made)he might've just wanted to cash in and put less effort into the story.
4,Bambi Review,"Bambi was about a young prince named Bambi,a deer, and his life avoiding man. Bambi is a delicious book. A true classic. Generation after generation will certainly love it like I did. You won't be able to put it down. I liked the book because, I enjoy hunting, so it was kinda cool to read about animals. The reason i gave it four stars was because I disliked the book a little. I disliked the book because it wasn't like the movie, and it made my fellow hunters look bad."
5,The Magic Trumpet of Old shows new life,"Don't let the drab CD cover fool you-- Herb Alpert's ""Second Wind"" is a treat for those who enjoy smooth jazz, particularly trumpet. The influence of co-writer Jeff Lorber is obvious here, as the music is very upbeat, but Jeff doesn't play the trumpet. There is still something about Alpert's trumpet tone that is unique. There is no tint. It is so smooth and rich. Listen to the track ""Wherever you are,"" for example and ask if you have ever heard such a beautiful tone from a trumpet. Alpert's playing is great throughout the CD-- Side steppin' and Rendezvous display his fine technique and great tone, which for me more than make up for his limited high-end range. I had to listen to the CD four or five times to appreciate it. Give it a try, its great music to relax to."
3,Not like the glory days,"I love Herb and his music in general, and really wanted to like this album, but to my ears this does not capture the old magic. The TJB recordings still sound fresh but this album sounds late 70's disco influenced."
4,Cocktail Music,"I heard the title song playing on the cable channel ""soft jazz"" and liked what I heard. I was surprised to see Herb Alpert as the artist and immediately googled the album to see what listeners thought. Bingo !Nice to have Mr. Alpert back in my ears."
5,A Perfect Gift...,"I recently purchased my second copy of this book, having worn out the first. It is a wonderful companion and teacher. I still find new ideas, deeper understanding and healing beauty in it.I would recommend this as a gift to self for any woman who is no longer quite comfortable with limited spirituality, and who would like to find out more about a moral structure designed to include women. Or gift it to a friend. There are many conversations to be had over the concepts in this book."
2,"Good Resource, but Outdated","Shekhinah's approach to learning witchcraft and practicing ritual is great. Her chapters really hit on the order in which to learn and the discussion questions and projects are fabulous!As a witch and a feminist, I did find that some of her woman-affirming diatribe was terribly outdated and felt disappointed that, often, Shekinah's solution to the feminine being excluded from mythology and historical texts is to rewrite myth instead of doing better research!I think women-only gatherings and magick are something every female witch should experience, but to give the reader the impression that if you're not a lesbian then you can't be a witch is well, just sad. Not to mention, untrue."
5,Beautiful.,"This is the very first book of this kind that I ever picked up, and by the time i reached the beginning of the first chapter I had tears rolling down my cheeks. This book was so healing for me the experience was almost beyond words. Yes, it does exclude ""the God"" but that is because not everyone WORSHIPS him. This is a book for Goddess worshipers, plain and simple. If you want the God, you're reading the wrong book! This book woke something dormant deep inside me, and ever since I have been hungry for the Goddess, hungry for knowledge...I recommend it with all my heart and soul, but be prepared to wake up! Blessed Be!"
5,an excellent beginner's book,"This book has been on of my overall favorites for Dianic witchcraft and ""womyncraft"" since 1991. It takes the reader through the very basics of witchcraft and energy work and leads them through ritual, tool, and spell design. Has an overly feminist tone, and a definite lesbian lean to it, but still an excellent book!"
1,Questionable...,The simple fact that Ariadne WAS NOT a goddess make the whole scenario much less credible. A minimal knowledge of greek mythology wouldn't hurt in order to produce a legitimate work.
5,An urgent message,"The author is correct in saying that Islam now presents a mortal threat to the very existence of European civilisation. Yet it is the liberal/left elite, which controls virtually all areas of public life on the continent, that has faciliated this crisis. Their role has been more than just that of appeasers. They have actively sabotaged the very moral foundations of Europe from within. The refusal to tell the truth about the jihad which has been ongoing against Christian minorities, as well as Buddhists and Hindus throughout the Islamic world for the past 30 years, is one symptom of this."
1,"Poorly written anecdotes, baseless opinions","Bawer addresses a very important issue in a rambling diatribe with very little factual support. This could be a fantastic scholarly examination of a current event. Instead, the book jumps all over the place in vaguely coherent anecdotes. From these anecdotes, the author draws sweeping conclusions that may be true, but his poor writing and poor research leave too many questions to accept as such.Do not waste your time reading this garbage."
1,Terrible book,"Effing awful. Badly researched and badly written, although supremely narcissistic. We have a book club of about 12-15 members, and not one of us could make himself/herself even finish it."
4,Acute--but Islamophic?,"After the recent controversy over the Danish cartoons this book is suddenly very topical and provides some good background information about the Moslem populations of Europe. Although I don't quite share the author's viewpoint I think he has succeeded at least in describing the context of the problem, one that Americans might not be familiar with. It seems to me that one can take too short a view and fail to see that multicultural integration takes time. The short view sees only the failures. There is a danger of incipient Islmophobia in the account. On the other hand what is described is in many ways a very difficult cultural mix, at once volatile and intractable. But to indict the liberal multiculturalism in the predominant tolerance of current European governments is a mistake of analysis, whatever some of the unfortunate details. In any case, this book, taken as documentation, fills an important gap in our knowledge."
2,Good try....,"From an academic standpoint, this book is severely lacking. Where is the data? Where are your sources?I applaud the concept - yes, having lived in Scandinavia - this issue is SO important that we cannot ignore it. However, as an academic, I have a hard time believing that this is more than just a book of opinions. If you quote a newspaper about a mercy killing, footnote/endnote the darn paper! It would make me actually use this book in an academic setting."
3,Positive with suggestion,"The subject is extremely interesting and vitally important for every America-especially for Europeans. But, unfortunately, to my opinion, the book has been poorly titled and poorly written to the extent that reading it is tirning.MH. Ziai"
3,No Sources to Check,"While I found the book compelling and interesting I have to admit I can't trust its reliability. There are hardly any footnotes or cited sources for me to check. For instance, Bawer claims Switzerland is 20% Muslim. Yet every statistic I see from other sources do not even come close in matching this number. If his statistics are wrong or I can't even check to see where gets his information I have no reason to take his word for granted. Why pay $18 for facts I cannot verify?"
5,European reader: Bawer is right,"As a European I can tell you, Bawer has some strong and convincing arguments about the European crisis. Let the European crisis be a warning for what are the results of a political correct society that promotes cultural relativism. Be warned and read this well written book, it's a quick read."
5,Excellent book,"This book is excellent. I am from Slovakia, a country in the European union and although I was brought up as a European, I found myself completely agreeing with this book which is very pro-American and anti-European. The author is clearly biased and he is devouted to his American style of thinking. He is also biased in assessing Islam in Europe. He is just describing all the negative aspects. Yet this is excellent!! The majority of Europeans are completely ignorant to the negative aspects of radical islam in Europe. The author has clear argumentation and supports his views by facts. Although I just finished high school, im trying to get this book into the media because I honestly believe Europeans must read this book. Its worth every penny."
3,Seems somewhat biased because he is Gay,"I found the book well written and it it sent shivers up my spine about what is going on in Europe. At the same time, his constant references to being Gay detracts from his presentation because of his sexual orientation, which he seems to mention on every page. If he had simply left out much of what can only be called a quest for more gay acceptance in society he would have made his point a lot better with the straight community, at least that is the way I see it. Would a heterosexual person write the book constantly referring to his sexual preference? I don't think so. Of course, that is just one of the reasons he was treated so badly by Muslims, so perhaps his personal anger kept this at the tip of his fingers so to say. But it does make one wonder if he exaggerated conditions based on his anti-gay experiences."
2,only OK but many factual errors,There are better books about the dangers of radial Islam without the racist tone of this one. I also found many factual errors that are available to even the most casual researcher. I prefer the works of those who have studied and lived side by side with Middle East culture for decades (like expert Juan Cole). I also believe Mr. Bawer's activist tone was possibly negatively inspired by his work in homosexual rights with his 'husband' (this is public knowledge). Several times in the book he incorrectly tries to link his own seeking of special rights for homosexuals with those inherently deserved by people of faith like devout Mulims. This is an incorrect and distasteful analogy.
2,Vital Topic - Low Calorie - Book,"Mr. Bawer's book is like your first potato chip - it is food, it does makes you want to eat more, and there isn't enough food value to it.This appears a vital problem that the EU and neighbors will have to solve, without our (US) help.The book would have been much better had it contained more statistics; hard data to show the real scope of the problem. I would have liked to have seen far fewer emotional quotations and anticotes, less Europe-bashing and more constructive, concrete, corrective suggestions.Finally, for such an educated, well-traveled man, Mr. Bawer has chosen to lump huge groups of individual, culturally-diverse people and their nations located thousands of miles apart across the globe into categories - Christian,Muslims and Jews, as well as ""Europeans"" and ""Americans"" in the USA. Each of these categories contains thousands of component groups that range all the way from anarchists, to the silent majority, to fascists."
3,Strongly Recommended If you wanna know about Europe today!,"It's a very truthful book Bruce Bawer has written. For me personally there was no new information, because I live in Denmark where we have a quite uncensored media. In other European contries the establishment practises more political correct sensorship upon the media I think, and have even written laws preventing people from expressing the truth. I must admit that I don't quite share Bruce Bawers belief in ""The War Against Terror"". For example after this so called ""War Against Terror"" had had it's victory in Iraq, the world witnessed a hitherto unprecedented flood of terror attacks in Iraq! No, the root of terror attacks in the West lies in the muslim immigrant population residing in the west (All Western terror attacks was carried out by Western muslim immigrants)."
4,While Europe Slept,Contains an important message why people should not allow themselves to be maniputated by political correctness or be cowerd by being labeled whilst pursuing their justifiable beliefs.
5,About time,"I can understand why the secular left does not the Christians here in the USA, but what I don't understand is how they seem completely oblivious to what their fate would be if Osama and those like him win this war we are in. The radical left needs to read this book. Someone get a copy to Rosie ODonnell and Michael Moore."
4,While Europe Slept,"The book was very informative and I would have given it 5 stars if he hadn't been so supportive of George Bush. I like this author. His book ""Stealing Jesus"" is a ""must read""."
2,dosen't work!,We had trouble getting it to lift off and when it did it was difficult to control. You can use speed to go up or down but you cannot control turning or landing. Don't waste your money.
1,Doesn't Work,"I charged it then tried to fly it, but it would only lift off the ground for about a second then come back down. A real rip-off if you ask me."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Don't buy","You can only control the choppers height, not the way it turns, goes forwards, or backwards. This is not an error to my surprise, the video explains this as a ""feature"". I explain it as a bad idea. So it's fun for the first 3 minutes, then it flies off on it's own never to be seen again. The only good thing is that it can survive quite a lot, as it is completely styrafoam, cushioning it's impacts."
2,"great idea, no control",It goes up and it goes down. Can't control anything else. I would give it 5 stars for fun if it could be steered.
1,a TRUE RIPOFF,"What the front box should say.""operates for 30 seconds on a full charge and you cant steer it, just watch it go in circles for about 5 seconds untill the battery cannot spin the roter fast enough to keep it airborn!!!First off, you cannot control the thing. It just floats, IF your lucky enough to get it off the ground. I put 8 BRAND NEW energizer batteries in the charging base and charged it twice as the manual specified. It lifted up for about 5 seconds, flew around in circles and then crashed into the grass. The manual also says that to turn it you just let off the throttle, but when you do this your helicopter comes crashing down!! The manual says you will get a whole 30 seconds of fly time which was not written on the box, (because it's pathetic). Another thing not written on the box is you cant steer it. NO ONE would buy this if they knew how it operated. For about 50 dollars more you can get a helicopter that actually works which is what i had to do.."
1,More hype than thrill,"This was very exciting for about 5 minutes. We got it about 3 feet off of the ground for three flights. When we went to recharge it a second time. It wouldn't work at all. Gratefully, we were able to return it. (At least Dad got it out of his system. :)"
4,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain,This was a great book to use with eighth graders! A classic piece of literature was a great way to end the year!
2,Did not include all the music from the movie I expected.,"I chose to buy this CD because I loved and wanted ALL the music I heard while watching the movie, The Horse Whisperer. This CD did not included all the songs I expected."
4,Movie Order of the Tracks,"This is a hauntingly beautiful score that I have deeply enjoyed, yet the tracks are randomly mixed and do not follow the order of the movie. For those of you who, like me, prefer to follow the chronology of the film in mind as well as ear, the following is the correct order of the tracks on this CD: 1. Hooves; 2. There Was Snow; 3. Accident; 4. Tunnel; 5. Awkward Talk; 6. The Whisperers; 7. Badlands; 8. Double Divide; 9. Lazy J (actually not in the final cut); 10. Runaway Meadow; 11. Hooking On; 12. The Very Act of Being; 13. Montana; 14. Iron; 15. Angus; 16. Pilgrim's Progress; 17. The Rhythm of the Horse; 18. Rancher's Wife; 19. Simple Truth; 20. Hereford Cross; 21. Voice of God; 22. Hobble; 23. Your Misfortune (None of My Own); 24. Grace; 25. Creek House; 26. The Vast Continent; 27. Percheron Stallion; 28. End Title. Enjoy!"
5,Music for Day,This is a great sound track. It is melodic and beautiful with just the right amount of melo to relax you.
5,Breathtaking,"Thomas Newman composes one of the most beautiful pieces of music. The entire score captures the majesty and beauty of Montana and everytime one listens to it one cannot help but think of the goodness of Tom Booker and how he affected all the lives around him. A very soothing piece with beautiful violins, pianos, the english horn and guitar. Highly recommended."
4,Peaceful,"I loved the movie. I was really touched by the story. When I listen to the music, I am reminded of the incredible Montana countryside and spectacular scenery. I enjoy having the CD on as background music while I work."
5,"Great music, great company","If you want to feel the open space, the open range and a real feel for the western life, go ahed and get this CD."
5,A major motion picture from the movie!...,I love this CD The Horse Whisperer & it is on soundtrack.There were pictures in the CD from the movie.This is a great CD & I loved it!...
1,Ginnia,"I believe I received a ""dud"" as sometimes it does not play at all and when it does it goes to extremes in volume. It is either very loud in parts and in other parts I cannot hear it at all. I cannot return it since it is an ""opened"" item.I am sure this is an error or Amazon would not have sent it to me. I have had excellent results with all other purchases from them."
4,Both the score and the country soundtrack are good.,"There are TWO soundtracks for this film, one the original score and the other, country music type soundtrack of songs. Both are good but different. Buy the ""origial score"" if you like the music you hear in the movie. This comes only in CD form from Hollywood Records. The other soundtrack is country music from MCA Nashville on CD and cass. Both look almost the same but read the cover before you buy. More movies now have more than one soundtrack, so pay attention to what you want when buying."
2,By far the worst of the trilogy,"Fans of Schnauss, which includes me, often consider this album the last one of a trilogy, the other albums being ""Far Away Trains Passing By..."" and ""A Strangely Isolated Place"". Unfortunately, this is, in my view, by far the worst of the three. It has neither the simple, shamelessly melodic charm of ""Trains"" nor the unrelentingly emotional impact of ""Place"". Where the childish vocals add flavor in the background on the other albums, here they are placed way up front, turning every track in which they appear into toe-curlingly sappy new-age schmaltz. Schnauss always uses loads of digital distortion and reverb, but here this tendency gets way out of hand, turning most tracks into a gooey, mushy mess, drowning out every musical nuance. Even after repeat listens I still don't feel this album as much as the other ones, so I will likely only listen to those in future."
2,Some good stuff.,"""Never Be the Same,"" the first track on the album, is magnificent, and should be considered a shoegazer classic. If you're going to listen to the whole album, hear this one *last*, as it makes an anticlimax of the rest of the songs.""A Song About Hope"" is good, too. Certainly flawed, but overall quite nice.The rest, meh."
4,Sweet but not as sweet,"I have all his albums and I really love his music. Would rate this album below ""strangely isolated place"" for the lack of inspirational freshness."
3,Not the usual Ulrich Schnauss I was expecting. Not as memorable as past albums...,"So I've been waiting a long time for this new album. I've found and purchased many collaborative mixes with Ulrich and have been very impressed. All albums prior to this one were amazing in my opinion. This one is not nearly as good. The first few tracks are ""okay"" and then the album sort of goes downhill from there. I know music is an ever-evolving medium, but I'm not sure I enjoy this new direction. Not one of those albums where there's songs that I'll listen to over and over again. A decent buy and an artist worth supporting, but I've definitely heard better from Mr. Schnauss..."
5,Ulrich Never Misses,"Goodbye by Ulrich Schnauss as his third album comes now with more vocals and powerful sounds. From the cover of the album you want to get it, when I saw it I wanted to get it right away. You don't have to argue much with Ulrich because you know the sound is there. Still having the mellow and cold sounds that have defined it but pushes the limits with vocals. I truly recommend it for a long drive or a long night."
2,He tries waaay too hard... with no success,"I've never read this author before, and am kinda regretting my decision. This book started out mildly intriguing, but after a few chapters it became obvious that Laimo's attempt at grue falls hideously short. He tries so hard to make this novel disturbing, and in doing so, neglects to expand on the plot, which in itself is quite elementary. Even the gore is boring, being too repetitive and, while mildly disgusting, does not make up for the lack of plot. Coupled with his chauvinistic attitude towards women, this so-called 'horror' book reads like a fecal-encrusted romance novel."
2,ending gone wrong,"I thought this was an entertaining enough book not very deep but kinda a fun summer read until the end. For me it not only made no sense but it seemed contradictory, DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT A SPOILERSatan erases his memory to ease his pain, Satan takes the soul of the demonologist to punish him for almost taking over the world. Satan then allows the demonologist to go after an imprisioned Bev. Why? If he wanted Bev why erase his memory and for being a vindictive prince of darkness he sure was forgiving to the demonologist. It seemed like a rushed excuse to set up a sequel or a bad attempt at an open scary ending. I frankly was disappointed at the ending."
5,Another Masterpiece,I can not get enough of his books! Honestly I was scared and I investigate the paranormal!
4,What a creepy book!,"This was an exciting and quite grotesque book! Not to mention a book that I should not have started reading so late at night! It genuinely gave me the creeps (yucky, yucky beetles...) Still, it was an interesting premise that could have been a bit more researched, but was still thrilling nonetheless. The ending was a bit of a disappointment, but, really, I am not sure that there were too many other options for a conclusion. I wonder if a sequel or something was planned? I would definitely read another book by this author!"
3,boring,"Maybe children won't be aware how boring Mee-Shee: The Water Giant is, but I certainly was! The first half of the movie is basically total nothingness about a boy and his father taking a trip to Canada and the boy meeting up with an Indian girl around his age and finding out there's a huge, mysterious monster in the water.There's no adventure, mystery or excitement for the first 30 minutes- just boredom. Perhaps when I say ""nothingness"" it's actually an example of such a predictably written story that I've seen a thousand times, that someone who HASN'T been exposed to this kind of storytelling would think of it in a more positive light.I thought the actual water giant was a really big exaggeration but again, perhaps your kids wouldn't notice since they're so young and usually can't notice or pick apart such mediocrity. Overall, it's not a terrible film but I find that the weak storyline really hurts it."
4,Mee-Shee,Bought this movie for my grandchildren and it is a wonderful movie to be enjoyed by the whole family. Defnitely recommend to purchase!
5,Wonderful Surprise,"We had never heard of this movie before about a month ago. On a boring TV Saturday afternoon I thought ""Why not?"" and flipped it over. This movie was incredible!!!! The ""Creature"" and story were wonderful. We fell in love with the whole package. It was so great to find that it was available on DVD at Amazon, so I sent for it immediately. I've recommended it to many people since, and have even shown it to a few. They've all loved it!! It is truly a real family movie which one just can not hardly find any more. If you have small children, older family members that are fussy about language and the like you don't have to be afraid of showing this one to them. Get it, get some snackies, and sit back and enjoy. OH YEAH, it is not a HORROR movie!!!!!!! Oh one more thing---there is a great surprise at the end!!"
4,A FAMILY FUN MOVIE,"I HAVE WATCHED THIS FILM OVER AND OVER WITH MY 4 YR.OLD TRIPLETS.THEY LOVE IT AND I ENJOY WATCHING IT.THEY HAVE SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR MEE SHE AND JUST LOVE THE CREATURE SO MUCH,ALMOST AS MUCH AS THEY LOVE E.T.ADULTS MAY COME UP WITH SOME NEGATIVES BUT THIS IS REALLY A PICTURE THAT ANYONE WHO IS YOUNG AT HEART WILL ENJOY!!!"
2,Meh,"Dont let the Jim Henson title fool you. Its basically a childrens B movie, without any of the cool parts of a B movie."
2,"Very misleading, Not What I Thought It Would Be...","While the jacket itself is okay and I like the colors, the fact that it is covered, and I do mean covered! with the tackiest, ugliest sewn on embellishments I have ever seen. If the shipping to return the item hadn't been so much I would have sent it back. Instead I have now spent a great deal of time removing the horrible, tacky gold sequins and fake coins and just that in itself has improved this item. I will either leave as is now or add some nice crystal type embellishments myself. When you view the picture of this it does not appear as I described nor does the text state there are actual fake coins sewn on. BEWARE!"
3,Its nice,"Nice bracelet, was a gift for mother's day. It felt a little cheap however. I guess you get what you pay for with this product."
5,good!,my girlfriend loved it! she said it was a great charm bracelet! it got here fast and i haven't had a problem with it yet. so it good!
2,"Pretty, But Not Good Quality","I like things that say ""Live Laugh Love,"" so my boyfriend got this for me for my birthday. After wearing it a few times, it was clear the quality isn't good. It got scratched, and looked tarnished/faded! And I only wore it to work, nothing crazy!"
5,:),I love my bracelet. I love the saying Live.Laugh.Love. I wear my bracelet every where and iv gotten many compliments on it.
5,"Beautiful Bracelet, Great Messages","I love this bracelet! The bracelet itself is, of course, gorgeous. It's so pretty and the red beads make it stand out even more. The words carved into it match the message in the box. Now it comes in a very cute little box that makes great for gifts. And the best thing is the message. I love it. It's a great buy! Great for birthday presents, Christmas presents and presents for yourself ;)"
5,Best of it's type (whatever that is),"The first four numbers can't be beat. As catchy as catchy can be, with great lyrics. What the ""Tunnel Song"" is about I haven't a clue, but it's great! The Trumfios did some work with The Aluminum Group, which is good stuff but entirely different. Kind of loungy."
5,Advanced reading studies,"I use this along with the Modern Guitar method and have improved my reading and also playing. It goes through all the positions and you gain a great grasp of notes, fretboard and technique."
4,"""A HEARSE RIDE TO TERROR PLUS A TOUR OF DRAC'S HOUSE!""","Here we go! Dim the lights, dim your mind and allow me to submit to you 2 Chiller Thrillers that offer tricks on your mind in Movie #1 and a Monster Parade in Movie #2! For the price, it's a Double-Feature with more than One Creature! So you have a creepy stalker following a woman in an old dark hearse and Monster Mayhem to follow...Ahhh, it feels like old times and good scares."
1,Terrible Quality,"Wasn't expecting much and it delivered on those terms. Quality is washed out. Seems as if it were recorded from a movie house on a camcorder. And as For Katarina being the host, why? Whom is this fat woman?. Sorry, this review is more of a jab at a studio trying to capitalize on a washed up bimbo and poorly edited and terrible quality dvds. Obviously packaging sells. Contents suck!"
4,Awesomely odd,"Whew, another strange one. In this story, your mom hires a babysitter from a company called either KidsCare or KidScare (actually pretty clever). You eventually pick which storyline based on an antangonist. If you pick Games, you go head to head with Dare, a strange man with tattoos (!) all over his body that he can bring to life. He can also bend time and do some other pretty strange stuff. Or, you can go with Zoe, the babysitter. I can't recall exactly how, but you end up in some bizarre, Hunger Games-esque woods fight and a strange underground factory where kids are turned into rats. If that sounds strangely cool to you, then I'd definitely recommend!"
1,choose your own adventure books arent real reading,"you want to read a book, read a good one instead of this goosebumps choose your scare crap"
2,Not the band advertised,"I purchased this as it said that it had a steel band, but it actually came with rubber band. I can't send it back either as this is a Christmas gift and it is too close to Christmas. Very disappointed"
3,Review of Pulsars Solar Powered PUA 111,"Shipping went well. Good looking, heavy eco-friendly - great! Charging went fine and accuracy is great too. However: Date changing doesn't work. I've tried several times to ajust according to the manual and thereafter the date doesn't change for two days. The glass got scratched after two weeks of normal use - no hard work involved. Thats a new record for me - I expected a lot more on this account."
4,watch review,"The watch is very nice, works well and is solar powered. The only issue is its a little heavy."
1,This book should not be in print because of the inaccuracies,"This has been one of the most disgusting books that I have gone through. It is full of errors as if no one had ever edited it. Whoever is doing the editing should be fired! As for the author, evidently she is not so well informed as she thinks she is because every chapter has errors, too many to even itemize. Every person who bought this book should be entitled to a refund."
2,think twice if your just beginning,I found this book hard to follow and the commands did not match the program. if you are just learning it is very frustrating to understand. i hope to find a better book after i am finished with this one
1,MacMillan/ Sam's Publishing has no shame,"I cannot believe the just kept-a-selling these hideously mistake riddled little guide books to an interactive ""course"" THAT DID NOT EXIST ANYMORE.They burned me this time, never again."
2,problem with discs,I bought this for my dad. They started watching it and they were only able to watch a few episodes and i bought it brand new. It says go to page 2. Does any one know what that means?
5,Hardy Boys DVD,I have the Spin and Marty series and just bought the Hardy Boys series. I hope Disney releases more of these series.
5,Great for long road trip!,We took our grandsons from N.Y. to the keys by car. Wanted to find movies we loved as kids that we knew theyhad never seen. Amazon had everything we wanted!
3,"Good text, atrocious maps","Connelly has a low opinion of almost every general in the Army of Tennessee. They can't do much right as far as he's concerned. In this, I think he overdoes it. And I think he's somewhat to hard on Braxton Bragg, and not hard enough on Leonidas Polk.Still, he's basically correct that the Army of Tennessee went from failure to failure, and that most of that failure was because of the high command. Connelly describes things pretty well here.But don't expect the maps to be of the least use. I've seldom seen worse. The ones where maps of the same area of Kentucky show roads vanishing and appearing are particularly bad, but none are good.Still, definitely worth reading."
2,Document of the 1985 band,"This 1985 line-up was not among the best. John Beland and Gib Guilbeau had called it quits (temporarily) so Greg Harris, Sneaky Pete, and Skip Battin recruited a drummer and attempted to return the band to its roots. Unfortunately, they didn't have the creative drive that the underrated Beland/Guilbeau team had. The musicianship is great, but the 1985 group took a big leap backward. Harris' strained vocals didn't help much either. The sound quality is miles above the very poor ""Cabin Fever"" CD (which features the same line-up), so, if you're curious, get this one. If you are not familiar with the FBB, don't start with this one."
1,his best lost,This Cd is not to be confused with the vinyl by the same name. It is a loss to prposperity not to be re-issued on Cd. What a shame.
1,Dissappointing,I found the original 'Take A Look Inside' album about 30 yrs ago in my Dad's record collection and i really loved it. A kicking cool album that had conviction. So i bought this CD thinking they had re-released many of the same songs from the original.Did he agree to a present day recording session to pay for a new dormer? Because this sounds exactly like too many people have been telling him for too long 'What? You're Thee Mickey Baker?'. Rushed and flash; he's stopped having anything to say.
5,Great for Hemorrhoids!,"I use this to stave off problematic hemorrhoids, as they are really just varicose veins and had a product that had many of the same ingredients as this blend, and it was very effective, but quite a lot more money. These are a lot more reasonable and their effect is the same if not better. My wife uses these for her legs and she used to get leg cramps at night (me too) and both of us have noted that that has not happened since we started taking this product."
4,language is not english,I like this book but its language isnot english.next time books must be send me english please..I did not read any info about this.
5,Fantastic book,"Finally a Paint Shop Pro book for photographers! Paint Shop Pro 8 is a great program but most books either parrot the User Guide or waste pages showing how to make silly projects. The author is clearly a photographer and shows how to enhance, repair and otherwise make OK photos into great ones. He includes tips throughout the book about how to take better photos with digital cameras. If you can only get one book on Paint Shop Pro, this is the one to get."
2,Not much help,"I was very disappointed in this book. I actually got much more information from the official manual. Instructions and explanations were very brief and the black and white illustrations are of (in some cases) no help at all. If you are interested in effects and artwork from your photos, this book really doesn't do it. I only wish I had got it on sale!"
3,"Not Everything, Mostly Photo Manipulation How To","The title of my review says it all. Although the title of the book is ""How To Do Everything ..."" it mostly shows you how to manipulate your photo images. Has some basic info on the controls but very little about how to use Paint Shop Pro 8 in creating or modifying graphic images. Get Paint Shop Pro 8 For Dummies if you want more useful info for the same size book/price."
1,I guess I should have looked for something more basic.,"I found that Paint Shop Pro is not like your usual Windows products, meaning that you are not just going to easily start using the program intuitively from what you already know of MS Paint or MS Composer. There are quirks and tricks. This book, however, is totally task oriented, and did not tell the reader the mechanics of using the JASC Paint Shop Pro tools. I had to access the Help files often.Also, the book was short-shift on the drawing aspects of Paint Shop Pro, and zoomed righ to the photo editing aspects. I felt like I was reading a book on a photo editing program like PhotoShop rather than PaintShop Pro! Doesn't the name PAINTShop mean anything--it's for drawing more than photos. If I wanted a book and program on photos, I would have bought PhotoShop or a similar application."
5,Very original,This would have to be the most original song I have ever heard. It has a very good music video too. This song is good to dance to. I listen to it repetedly because everytime you listen to it you always notice something different in the song.
4,Swayed by lofty praise,"Beginning skeptically, this could easily have been another randomly-named, decent rock band. It's a cut above that, though. As it can apparently please the harderfolk as well as poppy people, I'll give them credit for versatility. The songs are highly charged with emotion, and they mix them up nicely--each has a definite identity and place in the album. What it seems to lack is an inanely catchy single, or at least any that received adequate air time. I'm not convinced, however, that they will ever be more than a very good opening band. Certainly worth a listen, though."
3,Could have been much better,The Adamski version and Seal's version are classics. I was looking forward to hearing updated remixes but most of these remixes are average at best. The DJ Monk remix had a lot of potential (I am familiar with his work) but it's obvious they made him use the vocals way too much--a dub would have been more appropriate for the mood and should have at least been an included option. The Morel remix is the best of the bunch and this and the Monk remix are the only ones worth while for the sophisticated electronic music enthusiast. Buy the MP3s of those two and save the additional cost and plastic.
5,It's all about the music,"Holy cow, I was like a little kid on Christmas when I was tearing open the package on this album. From the first G Chord on When Mark Met Jen, to the final beat on Monday Afternoon, this album is solid all the way through. A nice balance of fast paced horn driven rock, to softer smooth vocals. Love the insert, all the band members as cartoons is a great idea. Love to see this band live, and they deliver the energy of the show into the environment of the studio. If you are into horns, witty lyrics, great guitars, and all around fun music, One Sip at A Time by PBM is a must have for your collection."
4,Tippy Rack,"Sturdy rack. Very pretty. Thankfully, my joist were spaced so that the hardware included worked well & installation was quite easy. One major problem --- The pots must be spaced in such a way to keep the rack balanced which is nearly impossible for me. The rack is always swinging & pots on the top fall backwards or forwards. Any suggestions on how to keep this rack stable??"
1,Problematic Grid,"I bought this pot rack due to its overall rating at 4.5 star and Cuisinart brand. However, I was really disappointed with the bad design and have to return it for a refund. Everything is fine with the exception of the grid. I could not place the grid securely on the octagonal base. The grid is supposed to sit on the 4 long bolts. Unfortunately, the grid width is too narrow (or the 4 long bolts are not long enough)."
1,Movie,"I was very disappointed in the condition of the dvd box on arrival. Bent and broken. Box was not in the same condition. Don't know if it was caused by shipping or sent that way.However, the time frame it took to get the movie was very prompt."
1,So bogus I had to leave the room,Pure fantasy - they might as well have faries causing the rotor to come off Marine 1. Watch Alice in Wonderland if you want unreality.
3,The Sentinal,"I was expecting lots of fast-paced action and plot changes, but was disappointed in what I got. A little too much on the bland side, however, it was better on the second viewing."
4,A bit dated but,really enjoyable. Michael Douglas is very good as is story line. Good for both my husband and I. Not too violent and not a chick flick.
4,A classic spy movie,"This is a spy thriller set in the US government in Washington and it involves a plot to kill the president. Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) is a long-serving Secret Service agent whose job it is to guard the First Lady (Kim Basinger). It soon emerges however that he is having an affair with her. As a result of this he fails a security lie detector test, implemented because it is believed (correctly as it turns out) that there is a traitor within the ranks of the Secret Service. His arch enemy in the ranks of the secret service is Agent Breckenridge (Kiefer Sutherland) with whose wife Garrison is also believed to have had an affair. Soon Garrison is on the run and the plot of the movie is intricate and exciting both before and after Garrison becomes the presumed villain."
4,Great Movie,Great movie. That shows the ability of both actors and why we will go to the movies. You can enjoy the story and they make it completely believable.
2,Very average.,"Michael Douglas trys hard as a secret service agent who appears to be framed. Kiefer Sutherland plays a co worker whos suspicious of him as he projects credible acting. Kim Bassinger as the typical frail, shaken first lady is a bore. That would basically sum it up. I was expecting more mystery and action and was disapointed on both. I can not find anything further to say about this film, and thats whats known as average. Destined for the back shelf . Oh, I came up with one more thing. The movie was full of camera jutting along with quick cuts in and out of scenes at an attempt to give big screen splendour. Great audio and picture quality ."
1,One of the most absurd move I've ever seen. Zero star out of 5.,"This is a movie about Secret service. One should expect logic, action and suspense from it, right?The most disappointing thing about it is there's no logic. Agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas),kissed the First Lady without closing all the doors right in the house where the President andother agents were resting! The simmering scene was photographed by a mole. It was later usedto blackmail Pete. Please be reminded that, Pete had more than 20 years of experience asa Secret agent. Yeah, right! Where's his intelligence? No wonder Secret Service had a mole whenthey had an agent like Pete. If this was a fantasy movie like Lord of the Ring, I would be able to ignorethis illogical hole.There are much more better action or supense movies than this."
2,Reminds me of basic instinct,"As I started to watch this film, my mind went back to the other kop character Douglas played in that film Basic Instinct called Nick aka Shooter. In that film, he seemed to fit the role like a glove: he was fit and dashing, and was believable. When I watched the sentinel, I couldn't help feeling that Douglas was (sorry to say it) clumsy and overweight. When he tried to run after someone, he seemed unkop-ish. Im a huge Douglas fan, but I felt he was trying to play a younger person's role, and it didn't work. The plot seemed a bit too far-fetched, and I ended up hoping the end would come soon. At the end, everything turns out as expected: Douglas gets all the praise, and there were no twists or surprises. In short, it was all too predictable."
2,Not one of Michael Douglas's better movies,"I found, The Sentinel not very interesting and kind of boring. The plot seemed to be attractive but for some reason just could not really get into the film. Might be good enough to watch once for the serious Douglas fan but if you pass on it don't think your missing much.Peter J. Miller"
3,I've seen the preview now where's the movie,"Not really much to say about this film. Not horrible, not great, and highly forgettable. There's a lot of story material slapped together here to create a fast-paced and at times confusing thriller. The action is not exceptional, but the movie doesn't really drag either. I almost felt like somebody was telling me about the story but I could see the images as well. It was difficult for me to really become involved with the characters and credibility was certainly stretched a great deal of the time. Actually the whole thing was somewhat like a very long trailer for a movie that looked like it might be pretty exciting and then, boom, some lame rap song and credits. It was like I saw the previews, but never really saw the movie. I'm not going to rave about this one, but it is probably adequate for a movie night diversion if you like secret service movies, scenes of Washington DC, or the actors involved. Otherwise, if you skip it you haven't missed much."
4,An easily enjoyable flick.,"There's not much I can say about The Sentinel as a film that hasn't already been said except maybe that the ending leaves a little to be desired, it's a little flat but otherwise it's a very decent film.I will say that the Bluray version of this disc is definitely an adequate transfer. It's not jaw-dropping, but it also doesn't have any glaring imperfections either. It's an upgrade over the DVD version in picture quality, it's sharper and seems to have better color representation and at $15.00 or less, it's definitely worth it over the DVD version."
3,Lack of surprise,"I think this movie could have been much better if peter would end up to be the traiter or something like that. Something like the plot in bourne supremacy. I got really disappointed when some obscure cameo suddenly came out of nowhere to be the mole. After all this movie is about traiter in secret service who you would expect to be a major charater with fair amount of character development.Probably it's because of all the Hollywood audience profiling, overall this movie feels dumbing down and unoriginal. It's like if someone looks cool he is the good guy, if someone looks ugly he is the bad guy. Even cartoons for children are not usually this simple."
1,comedy or drama,"secret service agent, michael douglas, is sleeping with the presidents wife, kim basenger, while he protects the president from the bad guys. i'm serious. i almost put this film in my library since it is one of the worst moves i've ever viewed and i thought i could loan it to friends who could get a laugh out of it. then i realized they wouldn't be friends for long. michael douglas, keifer sutherland, kim basinger, ""HELLO"", don't you have any pride."
3,24-lite,"Pros:1. Believable acting, although blunt at times2. Likable heroes3. Federal agents portrayed in a positive way4. High production standardsCons:1. Thin plot2. Thin character development3. Too many loose ends4. The villians didn't make you want to hate themI wanted to really like this movie because of Keifer. Unfortunately, his character was the least developed. I guess that's what you get trying to shove a great story into 2 hours. It's definitely worth a rental try.I appreciate that the director avoided gratuitous explicit sex, language and violence. That made it watchable with our teens."
3,Action film without any new twists,"This film is entertaining if you sit back and enjoy the flow of the film. The plot does have some serious holes in the acceptance of a relationship between two of the actors. Generally, if you ignore this aspect the movie will be somewhat enjoyable."
3,Sentinel,Not a very plausible story. While the movie is entertaining the story line is not believable.
3,Ok,"Michael Douglas is a top flight secret service agent who also happens to be having an affair with the first lady. When another agent is murdered, investigators played by Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria are called in. They uncover a plot inside the secret service to kill the president and eventually the evidence leads to Douglas. The final act of the film is Douglas using his skills to elude the rest of the agents while he tries to prove his innocence.The Sentinel is an enjoyable thriller, but not completely enthralling. The story is a little weak. The performances are good as these are all actors with a lot of experience. It's a good movie, but not a great one."
3,Action packed and entertaining the whole way through,"Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent, who not only once took a bullet for Reagan, but has been in the service for more than 25 years. When it comes out that there's a mole in the Secret Service, and that this person is in on a plot to assassinate the president, Garrison becomes a suspect. It's up to him to prove his innocence, and find the mole, before the president gets killed.This movie was action-packed and entertaining the whole way through. I was on the edge of my seat trying to figure out who the mole is and hoping that Garrison didn't get himself killed in his efforts to find the guy. Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria are excellent as the agents tracking Garrison, and Kim Basinger shines in a rare role as the First Lady. For anyone who likes political thrillers like the ones often starring Will Smith or Harrison Ford, the Sentinel will be right up your alley."
3,"Too weak a story devastating the great cast, strong performance, good lead-in and choreography","I admitted that I was attracted by the great cast and the ""24"" like setup. The first 30 minutes lead-in (with excellent choreography) showing the firmness and solidarity of the Secret Service in Washington DC is outstanding. Michael Douglas did perform well, and so did Kim Basinger who played the First Lady. Keifer Sutherland was as gorgeous as usual in ""24"". Eva Longoria was just a vase, but it's not her fault. However, there were just too many holes in the story/plot that devastated all as covered already by the many negative reviews here. I had watched on simply for the attractiveness of the performers, and not for the movie itself. In case you are a fan of the stars above, you may still rent it as some light entertainment. However, I have to warn you not to have the level of expectation from an average thriller at all."
3,Middle of the road for the genre,"The saving grace of this film was good cast. Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland, Kim Basinger are all excellent actors and Eva Longoria did well as the Secret Service rookie. It suffered from predictability, and while Douglas is a good actor, this is a roll he's played before and I got the impression he was almost phoning this one in. (Ok, a Michael Douglas phone in is still pretty good, but...).The one serious flaw in the movie was during the brief speech the US President was giving at a G8 meeting in Canada. A good thriller in this genre should be politically neutral. The writers/director/producers couldn't help sticking in a political commentary. Leaving that out would have been good for at least another 10-15% in DVD sales."
2,So So considering The Cast....,"Michael Douglas was Michael Douglas, Keifer was Jack Bauer and Eva Longoria doesn't look right with a gunPretty ordinary ho hum stuffDavid"
4,Good movie,"This movie is great. It is exciting and I liked it. For the story, it is very exciting without any boring parts in it. Well done on this! For the acting, they are all good. However, the best is of course, Michael Douglas as Pete Garrison. His acting is always good and this one is no exception. For the direction, it is good because from the beginning to the end, it is all in logical way. For the visual, music and sound effects, they are all good as well. I watched this movie only on the DVD. For the DVD itself, it is simply fantastic because this movie it has a lot of special features including two movie trailers, which are good. So, this movie is simply recommended to watch."
3,So-so,"With all the talent involved -Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland, Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria-- The Sentinel should have been a better movie. The idea is not a bad one: for the first time in history, there's a traitor inside the Secret Service, who's planning to kill the President of the United States. But screenplay has a lot of holes and flaws that not even this talented cast can overcome."
3,average,"This is a well casted film with a interesting plotline- a presidential security agent is accused of treason and while he is hunted he has to find the real mole. However the film never really takes off as promised. So why does it earn three stars? As I wrote above, the cast is quite good and it is watchable so long that you do not have high expectations. Eva Longoria shines as a beautiful rookie and Kiefer Sutherland plays a role that mirrors his tv character is 24."
3,An old story redone,The acting here is ordinary although it was good enough to give a 2 star movie a three. What we have here is a story of a president's bodyguard falsely charged and is now on the run trying to prove his innocence.It does seem implausible how he avoids his chasers while still finding out enough to help save the US president.
1,One of the worst of all time,"Okay....Lemme just simply say this: You CAN'T WIN. On top of that, the rules just don't make too much sense.Why can't I kill anyone, especially since I totally NEED TO?Why am I moving back after turning into Hyde, who happens to be extremely powerful compared to Dr. Jekyll?Why do I die when becoming Hyde?Why am I dying from everybody, anyway? Do they hold some sort of idiotic grudge against me for no particular reason?Why is this game so broken (In-game)?!These are the questions you'd often ask yourself when playing this. But of course, there's no answer to even one of them. Due to these very, very, VERY messy flaws, this is one of the worst games you'd ever play. PLEASE don't buy it, whatever you do."
1,WORST VIDEO GAME EVER MADE!,"This game is TOTAL GARBAGE! You would have more fun taking a hammer and smashing this worthless piece of plastic trash,than actually playing it.Hands down,this is THE WORST GAME OF ALL TIME! Do NOT EVER buy this game.Not even if it's 50 cents.It's a huge waste of time!"
5,For Writers to Think About,"This is a short, worthwhile book. Zaid does a great job of separating romantic ideas of ""immortal words"" and how books and writers ""ought"" to be appreciated from what makes a book truly worthwhile. As a writer, I found this short book of essays relevant to my own ongoing questions about what publishing ought to do. It helped me better understand that the success of a book isn't so much about numbers of copies sold as about whether the book participates in a real conversation. Take Me With You When You Go"
4,"Easy to understand, with valuable advice.","As an entrepreneur I know how important it is to prepare before getting involved in a startup business. We here at BusinessNation.com get a number of enquires, everyday from aspiring entrepreneurs with regrads to starting and running a small business. This book provides some valuable advice and information, which will help one understand all the aspects of starting and running a business. It is written by someone who has business and entrepreneurial background. However, I feel that it is written in a very simple and easy to understand fashion without all the unnecessary jargon. I certainly recommend this book to an aspiring entrepreneur and to those who are already in business."
3,"Okay,I guess","I think it could have been better.1)Carole was too hard on Stevie for playing a GAME 2)Lisa is much too smart to let something like friendship slip through her fingers.In this book, they make straight-A Lisa sound stupid! I really think this book could have been better."
2,"Good Quality, But Poor Pedagogy","Vocabulearn exploits the inexperience and ignorance of new language learners to promote the most ineffective language tool possible. Do not be deceived by the publisher's claims that it is a ""favorite"" tool, or that it is ""fast, effective and fun."" It is not. While it has value as a pronunciation drill aid, and the manual does show you the words and expressions both phonetically and in Arabic script, that is the extent of its usefulness. You will not learn a language, nor will you significantly increase your vocabulary, via the Vocabulearn tapes. By presenting the would-be language-learner with long lists of unrelated vocabulary completely devoid of any sort of context, the publisher insures that you can listen to Vocabulearn tapes, levels 1 & 2, regularly until the day you die, and you will never retain the material on a single one of the tapes. If you are serious about building language skills, do not put your trust in Vocabulearn."
4,"The one wine guide you want, need, and will use.","Like finding the perfect anniversery gift or putting on your snow tires, buying this guide should be one of those things you do each and every year.Why? Because it will pay for itself the very first trip you make with it to the liquor store. Think I'm exagerating? Then keep reading.Hugh Johnson is the Roger Ebert of wines. In other words, he knows his subject thouroughly but without ever being snobby or pretentious. He knows you don't find the perfect wine -- whether for cheap pasta, or coq au vin, or to lay down for a decade -- by price. Trying to decide between the 80 buck Cabernet Sauvignon or the simply labelled ""red table wine"" at 30 dollars -- and you've never tasted either? Hugh can tell you the better value. Not to mention which one is just plain better.And with that one purchase, you'll have more than paid for the book.So what are you waiting for? Buy it already."
1,Not the best for Midwest,"This pocket wine book reviews wines that are not readily available in the Midwest. If you live in California or New York, it may be a better option for you."
4,A great gift,"While this journal is beautifully made and the pages are quite handsome, I would have liked it to have been a bit larger. Or maybe just a few more pages. I did like it's size for traveling, making it easy to jot down a quick note. I would also have liked a blank cover and been able to use my own choice of picture. Worth the money."
4,Talented name-dropper bares what he chooses,"Salter's ability to turn a phrase, and to leave lasting images, are terribly impressive, but the reader is distracted by his effort to impress with whom he knows or at least shares a space with (who rode in an elevator with a flu-stricken Salter? Norman Mailer!). I very much enjoyed his descriptions of his days as a pilot, but again was distracted by Salter's continuous references to his ability to bed women. One can't help but feel that both Salter and this book would have profited from his staying with his military career, and spared the reader from knowing whom he slept with in a hallway in 1968 (Robert Redford!)."
3,The beautiful but empty shell of a fascinating life.,"Few writers can command the English language like James Salter. In his hands, words become a snake charmer's melody, casting a spell under which all sorts of improbable things can happen. Like the snake charmer, though, Salter appears to be mostly about performance. Once he's got you under, he doesn't seem to know what to do with you. The book is full of ravishing paragraphs, sometimes pages, but there is no real narrative. We never move from A to B. Those beautiful passages leave us stranded."
4,"Fine Soldier, Dissolute Civilian","I really liked Salter the Soldier. When he talked about his military days he seemed to be a man of principles who was living an exciting life. Several times when reading of his life as a writer after leaving the Air Force I had to look at the book's cover to be sure I was reading about the same man. He seems to have renounced the values he held dear while in the military and set out to do his best to emulate the unprincipled, bohemian life of the artist he longed to be. Baffling.Intresting, sometimes confusing, sometimes moving writing style. In the final analysis I'd have to say it was good though, because I read it cover to cover, putting it down only long enough to take care of the necessities of life."
5,You can't do better...,"...than this talented but neglected author's autobiography. Missing from other reviews is a comment on the depth of feeling Salter has for military life. Perhaps only someone who has been in the service and left can understand his love for his comrades, how poignant his departure from what he thought would be his career and his life, and the vacuum afterward and how he coped with it. A perfectly-written and enlightening autobiography; worth 10,000 self-esteem books ... if you want to reflect on what it means to live your life properly."
1,Callas Worship At Its Worst,"Riddled with inaccuracies, sensationalistic, precious, this wholly useless book is best ignored. Even the photos are poorly chosen, and the adulatory tone surprises only by becoming more and more treacly and embarassing."
1,Only for the seriously addicted,"The book is a quick read. I doubt it took that long to write, actually. Having read more scholarly books about Callas, I found this book to be pretty sensationalistic and *probably* an inaccurate representation of this singer.I have talked to people who knew Callas, and the general consensus is that she disdained profanity and was a rather private person. This book would have us believe otherwise. If you want to read a good Callas bio, try the one by George Jellinek, published by Dover. Also, I expect the one by Anne Edwards which will be published later in 2001 will be a good read."
4,CISCO TRIPLE!!!!!,"This trio of Cisco Kid films are overall good viewing and appear to be complete. No issues except for ""Old New Mexico"". I noticed 2 dialogue splices and at one point the video froze during dialogue and looked like it may have been a layer change. Layer changes on some of these cheaper DVD's seem to have rather extended changes. VCI has released all the Duncan Renaldo films except for one, Valiant Hombre, which doesn't seem to be available from anyone. There is also a color episode of the Cisco Kid TV program, which appears to be a syndicated episode since it only has a running time of 24:45."
3,"Okay book, didn't use it much","This book was alright. We barely used it in class and when we did, we just answered questions from the pages the instructor told us to do."
2,not impressed!,I used this book for a undergrad class and was not impressed at all. To me it came across as very vague and confusing. I do not believe that it should be used for undergrad studies.
1,"Boring, vague, useless","This book is boring, vague, and useless. I really think another book would be more suitable for my undergrad class."
4,Another Perry winner,"George March, Lord Ashworth, married Emily Ellison, Charlotte Pitt's sister. While the Ashworths are visiting his extended family, he dies from poison in his morning coffee. As he was the only one in the family who drank coffee, it obviously wasn't an accidental death. The Marches are ready to close ranks against Emily, who had been seething at George over his gratuitous attention toward a cousin's wife at the opera the night before. As far as they're concerned, she's just a woman scorned, and an outsider--so better she hang than one of them. But do you think Charlotte will stand for that for one minute? Not a chance. . . The Marches are what 100 years later we refer to as a dysfunctional family. Some things never change. . .have fun reading"
2,Couldn't hold my attention,"Being an Anne Perry fan I was disappointed in this mystery. It is the 8th in the Pitt series, and by far the least interesting. I don't know if I didn't like it because there wasn't much about Charlotte and Thomas and their children or what. Perry just seemed to rattle on with too many details. I hope the 9th book is better."
3,Cardington Crescent,"I usually love Anne Perry's books but this one seemed like it could have used some editing. It was quite repetitive and took too long to move forward on some key plot points. The reader was good, so the problem wasn't with her."
3,More like a Victorian romance,"Too much Charlotte and especially Emily. A dragged out,very close to boring novelCould , almost, have been a short story"
3,Cardington Crescent,"Ann Perry always paints a detailed and interesting portrait of life in Victorian England. This particular story, however,I did not find as compelling as some of her other novels. I always look forward to another Ann Perry mystery, and I mustsay that I did continue reading avidly to find out what was the answer to all the who-done-it question, but in the end,it was not as satisfying a read as I had anticipated. Of course, I would still recommend this book to those who enjoy a goodAnn Perry novel."
4,Liked it.,I enjoyed this book. As usual the author did a great job in illuminating the period and the stratified society of victorian England.
5,The true hitman is shown in this video!,The true hitman is shown in this video! It is a spectaculare tribute to him as a wrestlare plus it shows allhis great higlights.
4,One wrestler that does live up to his catchphrase!,"It's obviously very hard to put the best of ""The Hitman"" on one 60 minute tape. While it does feature a steel cage match with his nemesis Shawn Michaels & highlights of his Wrestlemania 10 match with Yokozuna, the other 3 matches (I.R.S, Bam Bam Bigelow, & Fatu), are only average. It would have been a bit better if it covered more of his earlier highlights, such as tag team action with the Hart Foundation & his emergence as a singles competitor. It would also have been fitting to highlight the feud he had with his brother Owen, as some of their matches, particularly from early 1994, were classics."
3,Mediocre and disappointing,"Bret Hart.....the best there is, best there was, and best there ever will be. This man shaped the fortunes of the (then) WWF after Hulk Hogan left. During this time, he had some classic matches, none of which are shown here.This tape is a mediocre offering of 60 minutes which shows his matches with sub-standard wrestlers like IRS, Fatu and Bam Bam Bigelow. The only saving grace is his steel cage match with Shawn Michaels.Notably missing are classics such as Bret-Owen at Wrestlemania 1994, Bret vs Razor Ramon at King of the Ring 1993, Bret vs Jerry the King Lawler at Summerslam 1993, Bret vs British Bulldog at Summerslam 1992, Bret vs Piper at Wrestlemania 1992,vs Ric Flair at Saskatoon 1992, Bret vs Mr.Perfect at Summerslam 1991......the list goes on and on!Why they chose Fatu, IRS and Bam Bam over these classics is beyond me.....I just can't understand it!!!!What a waste!!!"
2,Too bad you can't rent this....,It has a few people talking about their experience of moving to Spain from the U.K./Ireland. That's it. Very overpriced.
5,"Tahiti, Bora Bora, Moorea, Cozumel, Cancun, & Hawaii","I bought this last year for $25 bucks on amazon right before my honeymoon. We've been using it for over a year and took it all over. Other than some scratches from the coral it's in great shape. I think this is a great kit, and i can't see myself needing to upgrade."
3,Good for the price,"I have used the snorkel twice since I purchased the set. Amazon shipped the product very quickly. Everything seems to work well. The flippers seem to be pretty sturdy and seem like they will be able to take quite a bit of abuse.The mask is the one piece that I had problems with. It does not obstruct your view, but it does seem difficult to keep the strap tight on your head when you put it on, causing water to seep in when you first enter the water and the pressure changes. If you attempt to tighten the strap it eventually works its way loose. If you inhale through your nose you can keep enough suction to keep the water out, however.Other than that it seems like a great snorkel set for a beginner."
3,Looks good - but too big!,"I ordered this kit for a trip to Puerto Rico. Opened the package and tried on the flippers first - seemed very sturdy and good quality (I'm a novice but they felt and looked better than the pair I rented last time). The mask and snorkel also looked and felt high end for the price. However, I had to return the kit (reluctantly): the mask was too big for my face. I have a smallish (but not THAT small, plus I am a guy) head, and the mask failed the crucial test (it should stick to your face with a slight bit of pressure). So if you have a medium to large head then go for it, otherwise you'd best look elsewhere."
2,Almost ruined my trip!,"I was so excited to get my snorkel gear for Hawaii. I took the product out of the box and packed it carefully for my upcoming adventure. I bought one for my husband and myself. We found a beautiful spot in remote Maui, got out our gear, and my mask broke. Not even used and I was already missing out on the underwater wonders. The snorkel itself was the only good thing in the box. The flippers cut into my feet when I kicked and the other mask (my husband's)had a slow leak that could never be fixed through adjusting the straps. I would recommend renting equipment wherever you go or buying something else."
2,snorkel,"After two orders of receiving the wrong size of this product, I finally ordered from another internet site. I don't think the person handling this item was alert."
2,Mask pin broke!!!!!,"I bought this for my son for xmas and sent it to him in st thomas. The pin on the mask broke and came out. He only used it once! Can a new pin be shipped to me so I can send it to him????He likes the set, but cannot use the mask until fixed! Shipping to st thomas is VERY expensive!"
1,Don't Buy,I just used only one time in Hawaii for my vacation but it had broken.So I had to rental another gears.
2,bad product,"This product is just wasting money..I bought 2 , one for me and one for my husband and we both hated it..The mask is so big and easily lets the water in.. The fins are ok but not great.. Pay little bit more and get a better one, don't waste your money with that product !!"
4,seems to be good,"i am not going on my honeymoon to bora bora for three months, but i've been playing around with it and it seems like it will work great.!"
2,CHEAP MASK!!!!,"I bought this snorkel set and when I attempted to use the mask, it continuously leaked water. So, I kept adjusting it and tried to tighten it more...thinking that this was the obvious thing to do when it kept leaking water. However, after tightening it and snorkeling again, the mask's strap broke a very short time later. Overall, the fins and snorkel seem to be great for the price but the mask's strap isn't very well made and snaps in half."
1,No good,"Bought these to use on a trip to Maui recently. unfortunately, they are not of good quality. The masks do not fit comfortably and they constantly leak, no matter how much you tighten them. I even bought fog spray, but the goggles fogged and leaked, clearly they don't seal to your face like a good snorkel mask should. Also the actual snorkel doesn't fit well in the mouth and so you get water in your mouth and in the snorkel and unlike most snorkels, blowing the water out doesn't work very well. It's too bad cuz we really wanted to use them there so we wouldnt have to rent gear, but the snorkel gear we borrowed on our snorkel boat was much better and we were able to snorkel with ease. Luckily, I got these on Amazon, so I shipped them back for a refund as soon as I got back. I suggest renting a good set on site or buying a set you can try on in a store to make sure you're comfortable with the fit."
3,Great while it lasts,Used this kit on only 2 or 3 vacations over a 3 year period. Worked fine the first couple of times. On my last trip the mask just fell apart. Since I didn't use it that much there is no excuse for it coming apart.
5,My husband LOVES this snorkel set!,I bought this snorkel set for my husband to use in the Bahamas based on the reviews. It lived up to the great reviews. My husband loved it! He went on and on about how great it felt and how it performed. Highly recommend.
4,Pretty good,"The flippers and the snorkel work very good, but the mask was leaking for my head so I gave it to my dad and he says it works for him."
4,OK product,I bought this mainly for clean up my pool in the backyard when I need to drag the vacuum arround. It works OK but the mask is a little short for my face and keep pushing my nose up and after a while it is painful. I still not get use to breath using the tube because water can get into it easily.
4,Snorkeling gear,"Swim fins and snorkel were great. Mask was okay, but a little uncomfortable after an hour or so in the water. Overall a very good deal at the price."
4,nice snorkel and standard mask,"Snorkel:Nice mouth piece very comfortable after hours of snorkeling,. easy to adjust and cleaning water out. 5 starsmask.normal performance. fogs easily. 3 starsfins:very flexible and comfortable, the size were right. easy to drive even if you dont have dive knowledge.4 stars"
4,"Good set for the money, but you get what you pay for.","We only snorkel a couple of times a year, so we didn't want to invest too much. We got these for the whole family and have been satisfied. I wear size 14 shoes, so it's no surprise my feet don't make it all the way into the XL fins. This gives me a bit of foot fatigue on long excursions - but I've done 2 hours and lived. The split fin models are more comfortable. The mask has lots of room, but does leak a bit. I find I have to clear it every 15 minutes or so - a nuisance but not a deal breaker. The snorkel is extremely good with a comfortable mouthpiece a pretty good immunity to taking on water. I've had some choppy and windy days and never taken on water. All in all, a pretty good set. Blows away what you used to get 10 years ago. It's not state of the art, however - but you don't get state of the art for $30."
3,Okay Quality for your Money,All in All this is a pretty good value for your $$$ but beware the fins will only be comfortable if you have narrow feet and the fins are a little to stiff IMHO...but it's a great bargain for a starter set so it's not the end of the world if these don't fit well.
2,"Mask irritating, snorkle ho-hum, fins good","I paid $30+tax for the set on sale, but returned it to Big 5 because the clear PVC is inflexible and would probably dry out even more in a short time. The uneven seams irritated my face after 2 minutes in the pool. The snorkel mouthpiece tasted like plastic and was too large for my mouth. The fins were the best part of the set. The bag was really flimsy and I wouldn't expect it to hold up on my trip. For $13 more, I got a silicone set with a smaller mouthpiece, a box for my mask, dry snorkel, and defogger.Update 10/13/08: I ordered just the fins thru Amazon for $20."
2,Pretty set but inflexible flippers,"Lovely set and a great deal for the money, but the flippers were very stiff and inflexible. Made my feet feel like they could cause a cramp at anytime- not the safest feeling in the water. Flippers felt very unnatural in the water. I prefer a more pliable-flexible flipper that moves with the motion of your leg...these don't. I just didn't feel the power behind a kick because of the stiffness. Did not try the mask on but it looked of very nice quality."
4,Really good for the money invested!,"We ordered this snorkeling set and have really enjoyed it. As a matter of fact, we ordered one set and the fins were so much better than our 2nd cheaper set, so we decided to order a second set from U.S. Divers. The fins are really excellent for the money invested. The foot is all rubber, so it fits snugly and comfortably. I wear a woman's size 8 but was instructed to order the small size which I believe is 6.5 to 8. It fits great and will not come off in waves. Everything about the set is comfortable and works well. We have used it several times and will be snorkeling around Hawaii in 2 weeks!"
2,Not what I hoped for,"I ordered this set for a week long snorkeling trip to the BVI. The reviews seemed mostly positive, so I took a chance. I wish I'd paid more attention to the negative reviews. The mask leaked quite a bit, and the side adjustments on it would not stay tight. The fins were very stiff...I guess I prefer a more flexible fin. I ended up using other people's equipment when they weren't using theirs, and not snorkeling as much as I would've if I had been happy with my own set."
1,SUCKS,"Unless you have the face of a child the mask is good for nothing, the snorkel is VERY uncomfortable; AVERAGE fins, maybe good for tropics."
4,"Liked this so much, I had to buy another","I bought this last year for a trip to the Carribean. I only bought one set for my husband to use. I used it while we were there, also, and liked it so much I decided to buy another set for myself. The mask fits well, the fins are great, the snorkel works well and it's easy to get any water out of it."
4,perhaps it depends on your face,"We bought 2 of these for our trip to the carribean. I was very satisfied with mine, but my boyfriends mask kept leaking. I tried both masks and neither leaked for me. Perhaps his bone structure is not compatible. The flippers and snorkel worked well for both of us."
3,Design and Mask fit could be better,"I ordered a men's size large (US shoe size: 9.5 -11.5) snorkel set. The snorkel pipe and the fins fit well, but the mask fitting was atrocious. The distance between the glass and the nose base (vertical height of the mask) was so short that my nose was squeezed and bruised and could not use it for more than 4-5 minutes. Had to borrow a friends mask to proceed with my snorkling. I wear a shoe size 10.5 and have a medium built head frame. Wonder how people with larger faces can use this mask."
3,ok,"I thought this set was ok, Its a great starter set, but on my third snorkel outing the mask was leaking really bad. I still use my fins and snorkel, and just attached it to a better mask :)"
3,"Decent, but flawed","The snorkel is okay, although I have to complain about the left-side-only design. Splash guard functions okay, as does the purge valve. The goggles have problems keeping their seal, both on my girlfriend's smaller face and my medium-sized head/face. Uncomfortable, constantly leaks, and latches on the side keep letting the straps loosen up.Fins are decent, just realize there is limited amount of adjustment. Finally gave up, went to a dive shop, and bought Deep See fins and Cressi dive mask and snorkel. So far, great performance out of both of those in both the ocean and freshwater springs."
3,Good for beginners,"Bought two pairs. The fins and the snorkel do the job just fine, but we both had some issues with the goggles. Either left pressure marks or leaked a bit. Still, OK equipment to get started."
2,Mask Broke On First Use,"I ordered this set for my son, an experienced diver, and the mask strap adjustment clip on the side of the mask broke off on the very first use.He knows how to adjust a mask and did nothing incorrectly.As for the fins, he loves them. He described them as comfortable and great in the water.Each of the 3 items in this set needs to function correctly or a trip can be ruined, so my 2 star rating stays.If he had not had an extra, older mask along, the day would have been ruined."
2,Should have known better (the you get what you pay for part),"Mask: The size and visibility are okay, but this mask does not seal at all and leaks massive amounts of water. The skirt material is not flexible enough to provide proper seal.Fins: Solid plastic blades without any flex. Very low heels do not keep fins safely in place.Snorkel: No problems."
3,"Fins are great, mask and snorkel are not.",These fins work very well for my size 11.5+ feet (I got the size XL). Foremost they are very comfortable (no complaints or tender spots after using them almost every day on a recent 2 week trip). Although the are larger/longer than other US Divers models (available at Costco) they packed easily in a large duffle bag.The mask and snorkel use a clear rubber/plastic that is not as flexible as other models/makes and this made these items unsuitable for me or other members of my family.
3,The good and the bad,"The #1 consideration is price. This set is a value. The only bad is the mask did not stay tight. Maybe I did something wrong, but it should not be difficult to use. The fins and snorkel worked great. I would recomend this set for beginners like me to test the waters so to speak."
3,5/50,"I bought two sets for my husband and me for Mexico. The snorkel and glasses were great. Clear, comfortable and easy to use. The fins, on the other hand...they bent from *swimming* and one of them broke completely in half. I was pretty disappointed with the fins. But, for $30, it was totally adequate for the week that we used it."
3,Mask worth the price,"This is an inexpensive set that will get you by if you do limited snorkeling and diving. The snorkel leaves a lot to be desired and the fins are just okay. The mask, however, is worth the price of the kit. It's comfortable and is on par with masks costing a lot more than the entire kit. That said, the last set I got had much better fins and a much better snorkel, although you'd be better off with a snorkel from a dive shop.I've scuba'd with the old set, but would not attempt to scuba dive with the fins and snorkel that come with this set."
3,good for vacations,My GF and I both purchased this set for a trip to the USVI and we really enjoyed them. I recommend getting anti-fog for the mask and scuba socks for the fins to make snorkeling more enjoyable. We also had an issue with the mask being to large for people with smaller faces.
1,Get the higher quality product,"Poor design. Uncomfortable mask, stiff plastic, stiffer than it should be.. Mine arrived with the inner seal bent by the packaging, rendering it leaky, useless and exceedingly uncomfortable. Their ""professional"" quality mask is much more comfortable and works well."
1,Mask broke on second use,"After starting out to great promise, the cheap-o plastic connection from the strap to the goggle snapped, soon after my SECOND use of the product.The setup worked great for a grand total of 45 minutes,so if that's what you're looking for, have at it!"
1,This Item is Worthless,"The snorkel broke right after I got in the water. A small pebble/piece of sand got wedged into the bottom piece that is supposed to expel water. It got stuck open and turned the snorkel into a straw that sucked water directly into my mouth. I could not use this item to breath (which is the whole point of a snorkel). The mask did not create any suction, so I constantly had to blow air hard out of my nose to keep the mask from fogging. The flippers bent to a 45 degree angle from just swimming. I didn't stand on them, or hit them on a rock, it was just swimming that bent them. I had to rent a snorkel on the beach. I will try to return this product. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. SPEND SOME MORE MONEY ON A GOOD SET. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
3,Good snorkel set- sizes are weird,"Had to return because had trouble figuring out which size fin best for women's 9. What arrived was a much larger size, more for men's feet. ended up getting travel fin/snorkel set specifically for women and am happy with final purchase."
3,Size chart confusion,"Beware of confusion regarding the women's sizes on this item. I wear a size 9.5 shoe so based on the size chart in the product description, I ordered the Med/Lrg size. But when I got the gear in the mail, the box indicated that the Med/Lrg size was a women's 6-7.5 which would be too small for me. I scheduled a return for the item. I didn't want to open the box and risk not being able to return it for a refund. But some confusing comments on the review of this item caused me to take a second look. I did try the fin on and it did fit!!So....long story short, the size chart listed in the product description appears to be correct, but don't be surprised when you get the item in the mail if it looks like you got the wrong size. Try it on first to see.Hopefully this will save someone some time and frustration."
3,Mask let water in,"I don't know if it was a defect in one mask or quality of the model, but the mask did not keep water out. You could clearly see that it was deformed before putting it on. Luckily Amazon is amazing and made the return process simple. The fins are nice though."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","First off, the snorkel isn't a true dry snorkel. There is no valve to keep water getting inside the snorkel. The fins on the yellow version have an adjustable strap, while on the blue version there are none. No mesh carrying bag was included like with other U.S. Divers sets.Its not a bad product, but not really that good either."
4,Good starter set.,"This set worked well for a while. As we've gotten more experienced at snorkeling, we want a better set anyway. The price is right on this set, though!"
3,Dry snorkel?,I was disappointed when I recieved the snorkel sets I ordered. The add stated the snorkel was a dry snorkel. My understanding of a true dry snorkel is one that has a float device that prevents water from going into the snorkel. The snorkel in the cozumel set only has what I would call a splash or wave guard.
3,Very Disappointed with Quality...or lack thereoff,"I was hoping that this set from US DIVERS would be of better quality than what it turns out to be.The flippers are cumbersome with no adjustment straps, and ill fitting if you are NOT THE EXACT size (Note, each size claims a wide range of ""fit"")...they don't.The mask is also difficult to get to stay watertight seal...you have to snug the straps way too much!!The snorkel is fine....except that it only mounts left side, and I have always been more comfortable with a right side or reversible fit.Besides the above....they are borderline OK.I would not really recommend these and think another brand of higher quality would be much more suitable. I have snorkeled for years, and I have already donated these to the Boys and Girls CLub locally for kids to use in the Clubs Pool."
1,TRIP TO ARUBA NEARLY RUINED....,"THE US DIVERS COZUMEL SEABREEZE DRY PROFLEX II MASK,FINS, AND SNORKEL SET ALMOST RUINED MY RECENT SNORKELING TRIP TO ARUBA! THE FINS WORKED VERY WELL BUT THE MASK WAS HORRIBLE AND KEPT LEAKING WATER INTO MY EYES. FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO GET A USED MASK FROM SOMEONE THERE BUT THE FIRST 2 OF 6 TRIPS WERE FRUSTRATING AND A TOTAL DISASTER! DO NOT BUY THIS SET UNLESS YOU ONLY NEED THE FINS!!"
4,Just what we needed,"We spent a week on Isla Mujeres in Mexico during late March, we purchased this dive set so we wouldn;t have to rent and the gear we purchased was far superior than what was offered. The value was expectional, and i found the whole process easy, i encourage other consumers to purchase this set."
1,Mask Leaks - Here is a Test You Can Do to Check,"We bought this set based on the mix of favorable reviews and were disappointed. The mask leaks. Most people probably know this, but a GOOD TEST is that you should be able to (on land!) press a mask against your face and have it stick by ""suction"" (without using the strap). Neither of the two we bought came close: air hissed in and they came off within 1-2 seconds.The gasket around the mask that conforms to your face has distortions in it, and is made out of a less-pliable material than that of our other snorkeling set mask. I was hoping this was a one-off problem, so we ordered another identical set and had it overnite-shipped. Same problem: the mask gasket was distorted and had small kinks in it.So, I have to conclude there is some sort of production problem. If you buy this set, at least BE SURE TO TEST the mask using the above procedure so that you don't discover the problem on vacation.Hope this is useful...!"
2,Horrible value!! A cheap rubber set works much better!,"Water kept seeping into the nose part of the mask as soon as I would put my face in the water. The problem is that the mask is not capable of creating a watertight seal the way good masks do. No matter how much I tightened the mask, it wouldn't prevent water from seeping in. In addition, the flippers are much harder to use than ordinary rubber flippers because they are not nearly as flexible and they slip off much too easily. I switched to a cheap rubber snorkel set and was MUCH happier. Save yourself the money and buy a rubber set."
1,Stay away,"Do not buy this pair. It's badly made and badly designed. After a couple of days of beach going with the occasional snorkeling the fins started to deteriorate, literally, and the mask was always full of water no matter the corrections I made to the strap. Very bad choice even for swimming in pools. Stay away."
4,Great gift for snorkeling fans,"I bought this for my husband for our trip to Tulum, Mexico for lots of snorkeling. It worked out terrific for him -- except he lost one of the fins when our kayaks went over far out in Soliman Bay! Great price!!"
5,Solid gear,"I would recommend buying this gear to do some snorkeling. For the price you cannot go wrong. The fins fit me well, the mask is solid and does not leak water. Great product."
1,Good for 1 vacation ONLY,"We bought four of these combos. After several sessions the fins flexible and stiff parts split apart. The mask silicone is very stiff compared to other masks costing only slightly higher. They do not fit narrow faces well at all... LEAK. The mask straps slip. The strap attachments are very cheesy and break easily. The snorkel clips do not keep the snorkel attached to the mask and fall off while carrying. After a season of cruising, we are buying all new setups. We would NOT buy any of the US Diver combos again."
2,Snorkel Set Review,"Fins are good. Snorkel tube was decent. Water still entered the purge tube occasionally, I had to keep blowing it out. That kind of defeated the purpose of purchasing a tube with a purge feature. It was somewhat of a nuisance, but didn't distract me from enjoying the reef. The mask is horrible. Be careful the strap can break easily. I bought two sets, one was fine and the other broke the first day.I wouldn't recommend this set to anyone. I'm surprised with the poor quality b/c U.S. Divers products are usually great."
2,Plastic pin holding mask strap tore out,The pins on which the strap pivots (and connect the strap to the mask) are cheap plastic and pressed-fitted into place. The first time I tried adjusting the mask while it was on my head a pin pulled loose and that was that. I finished that session holding the mast to my face with one hand.To keep it short and sweet: this is a cheap snorkel set for a mid-range price. If you are only the occasionally snorkeler while on vacation I suggest renting. It's easier and cheaper than you might think.
4,Perfect for vacation snorkelers,"I bought this set for our once a year beach vacation, and I'm very happy with it. I've tried it out in the local indoor pool several times. The mask is comfortable and does not leak and the glass is clear. When we take our snorkeling trip, I'll bring some anti-fog for the mask. The snorkel clears easily after you dive and surface.The fins are the full heel type with no strap and they fit perfectly. They offer a nice propulsion and are comfortable - I've not had ankle fatigue or red marks. I think the fins are far better than any I could rent.The snorkel works well and the only problem I've had was the plastic clasp that attaches the snorkel to the mask broke fairly quickly and I had to resort to a rubber band. I think it was too stiff/brittle.Without the clasp issue, I would have given this 5 stars for the vacationing or casual snorkeler. I would buy this set again."
2,Fins are decent....mask is not.,"I purchased this set to use during my scuba certification class. For the price, I believe this set represents a good value for a beginner/infrequent snorkeler IF you can get the mask to seal properly. Unfortunately, I never could get it to fully seal and the straps easily loosen after you attempt to tighten them. The snorkel is decent and even has a purge valve which is handy. The fins also provide decent thrust and the vents keep your legs from turning to mush. But the poor design of the mask ruins the whole set. I have since purchased a mid-range Mares mask and it is just so much better overall."
4,"U.S. Divers Cozumel Seabreeze Dry Proflex II Mask, Fins and Snorkel Set",The Product work very well and the fit was good. Was not sure that they would fit well but its great
3,Great value,I purchased this snorkel/fin set for a trip to Hawaii. I had purchased a different brand at a national retailer that was twice as expensive. Needless to say I returned the other set and ordered two more sets for my wife and daughter. Couldn't be happier.
3,Good price but hardened plastic on face skirt is a problem,"I ordered two of these sets for an upcoming trip. One set was fine but on the other set, the face skirt was hardened in spots. The skirt is supposed to be flexible so it seals and is comfortable. I exchanged the second set and the replacement had the same problem, although not as bad as the first set. From what I undestand, there are higher quality (but more expensive) masks made with silicone that won't have this problem."
3,Us Divers Snorkel Set,Got this for my wife to practice in the pool with and take on vacation. Great complete beginner's set. It's better than the rental equipment you get on vacation.
5,Better than expected,"I thought it will work pretty good, but it was excellent. I loved this set and was very glad I purchased it. I used in Aruba almost every day of my stay. The snorkel design was great for when there were waves because if some water splashed into it I was able to blow it out without going up."
4,good for the price but...,"i need to get a new mask. the silicone on this is really hard and uncomfortable. however, you really can't beat the price on this puppy. the snorkel works great."
3,A good deck,"I was very excited to run across a tarock deck from Italian manufacturer Modiano, distributed by U.S Games Systems. Upon inspection, I found the imagery in the trumps and suit cards to be that of the standard imagery found commonly in tarock decks. The only reason I rate three stars is because the image quality is low. The people on the tarocks all look like they need a shave, including the women; and some of the faces are slightly distorted or fuzzy. The box name for this deck is Modiano Tarocco nr.500"
1,Instructions ARE NOT included,"Well i got my new deck opened them up and no instructions are included, (the item description said they were) I am going to contact amazon and try to get a refund but they were opened and may not qualify. I might be able to get directions online if worse comes to worse-- otherwise i have a pretty but useless deck."
1,so repetitive!!!!!,the heroine with her blowing hot then cold for the hero just keeps repeating over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over....... it was ridiculous. the younger sister was an immature clueless duence. what made the read frustrating is that the book also contained great characters whose storyline was far far more interesting. the main lead was a cry baby who leaped to assumptions in one second flat. i was dissappointed that the hero continued to try to placate and win the toon.
4,The Wagered Bride Clearbrook Series,Very good and quick read! Has many of the same twists as the first book can't wait to read the last book of the series.
4,temp switch,temp switch is a little small to be connected strait to a fan but if used with a relay will be fine
2,Disappointed,"Bite Shield was supposed to be my protector. Hope commitment in vain. The biting insects were not at all discouraged. The product may just not be helpful when some humans' intent to shoo away the bites are concerned. With me, it felt like I had to be covered with one of these products throughout my body to be protected from the bites. Senseless effort, indeed."
3,Lentek Bite Shield Refil,Works as advertised is the refill how else would it work. Just hope the product works as the bite season is upon us.
5,SHORT AND TO THE POINT,"On a personal note, I will avoid giving my opinion on the Vietnam War and it's purpose (as I could go on for hours), but simply state that I feel sorry for those who were forced to participate in this bloodbath, and even sorrier for the sick individuals who forced them. This book was rather short but very informing. It was not long winded; yet still explored deeply compared to a book on the entire war or just a textbook. Dipping into the feelings and emotions that the troops in Charlie Company must have felt, which most likely caused them to commit such a vulgar act against the people of My Lai's freedom (which they were supposedly fighting for), and humanity in general. All in all, an easy to read, brief history of The My Lai Massacre.""Fight War, Not Wars!"""
1,These Phones last about 3 Months,"I purchased these phones in January of 08. Within 1 week, one phone stopped working because it was ""Out of Range"". 1 week after that another stopped because it was ""Out of Range"". Now the third phone's display shows nothing but a jumbled mess so I cannot check to see who is calling and when I talk with someone they say it sounds like I have a cloth over the mouthpiece. What a rip-off - stay away from these phones."
3,Price was good,For the price the phones are good. I do get alot of static on occasion. I haven't tried to fix it yet so there may still be a way to correct the problem. DON'T put the clips on or you will not be able to shoulder your phone. The ring tones are fun. Shipping was fast.
3,"This phone system is only ""OK""","I researched this product for some time before buying it, and the reviews on various sites convinced me to buy it. Some incorrect claims about this product:The phone supports up to four handsets, not 10The reception is choppy sometimes, even next to the base - I haven't found a patternThe handsets do not all share data - when you enter it into one, it is not accessible from the others, as some reviews had claimed.One other thing is that the phones are a little *too* small in my opinion, and take getting used to before they are comfortable.Overall I'm disappointed with the performance of this phone system and I would not buy it again; however, it meets the current demands for my household, so I'll continue using it until it dies."
1,Totally inaccurate,You never get the same reading twice it keeps on going up and up and eventually it will show that your kid/ baby has fever which I already know by kissing the forehead and seeing the crankiness. But in the first 2-3 measurements show that he doesn't have fever. So you can not rely on this. If he is doesn't have a fever it will go up and eventually it will go down but it varies by 2-3 degrees each time you take a measurement. Absolute piece of junk!
1,AAAs and covers: good. Accuracy: HORRIBLE,"I love it being small, and I really love AAA batteries rather than buttons, and the covers I actually like. But... IT'S TWO DEGREES OFF!!!"
1,Grossly Inaccurate,"I bought this thermometer from CVS to see if my 16 months old daughter had any fever. The readings were consistently low (around 95 to 96 degrees after more than 5 attempts) so I decided to use the traditional rectal one to verify the result. And the reading from the rectal one showed she clearly had a low fever of around 100 degrees. I also tested it on myself and my wife. Again, the readings hovered around 94 to 96 degrees after many tries. So I concluded that this thermometer is very unreliable and I will return it because it is more dangerous to use this thing than not using it at all."
1,Fine unless you want to know your temperature,"This thermometer does in fact come up with a temperature reading quickly. However, if you take your temperature several times in a row, you'll find that the reading changes constantly and significantly. My wife is sick right now, and at one time, she is getting readings ranging from 98.3 to 100.5. In other words, this is a useless product. Don't waste your money."
1,"Most expensive, yet least accurate thermometer I own!","you'd figure if you spent $[...] on a themometer, you'd end up with something good. Not the case here. This thermometer found it's way to the bottom of the barrel. Don't waste your money. This thermometer is only effective if you take the temperature of a healthy person on multple attempts, add them up and divide by the number of attempts, then do the same with the sick person, add them up and divide by the number of attempts and then compare the two numbers. Who needs to do all this math???? Well that was what we had to do when on vacation when this was the only one we had and our son had just suffered a febrile seizure. This thermometer is consistently low by 3-5 degrees which was scary because it showed our son's temp barely higher than normal when in fact it was probably in the 104-105 range.Considering what is on the line here (your childs life), this piece of crap ought to be recalled."
1,Grossly inaccurate,"We bought this as a replacement of a safety 1st ear thermometer that broke down. It has been continuously inaccurate ever since we bought it. We have been forced to take several rectal temperatures in a panic after this so-called-thermometer told us our children's temperature was up-to 105.3'. Rectal temperature showed 102'. Other times we had successive readings that varied from 94' to 101' that were taken within minutes of each other. Again it didn't feel right, and there goes another rectal temperature, this time 104.I can feel my kids' temperature with my hand on their foreheads more accurately than this thing measures. Tomorrow I will go and get another ear thermometer and throw this thing away."
1,environmentally unsound,"The thermometer is okay, though difficult to position correctly in your own ear. The sensor covers, though, are expensive and are packaged in wasteful plastic dispensers. When the dispenser fails, you can't get the covers out and can't use the thermometer, so you throw away this plastic box and waste money on the covers.Do yourself a favor and try the Braun Thermoscan Ear Thermometer, also sold by Amazon."
2,If it weren't for the sensor covers . . .,"This thermometer would be all right for its price if it weren't for the fact that it HAS to have its own special sensor covers supplied by Vicks. That it takes these special covers isn't so bad in itself, it's the fact that no drugstore in my area sells replacement covers (and even if I bought them online, they are ridiculously pricy for something disposable). If you use generic covers that are readily available, it flips out. If the thermometer could use any ol' sensor covers it might, just barely, be worth it. And even with the sensor covers, it is inconsistent, sometimes giving you a temperature that a corpse would have and sometimes beeping madly when you ring up one degree over normal. I guess the only upside is at least you don't have to hold the thing in your mouth for two minutes."
1,Garbage,It's garbage. it is almost impossible to change the temperature setting. I sit there for 20 minutes trying to change it but setup is horrible
1,Junk!!! Waste of money!!!,"I ordered this in Febuary, an did not need it until now. Well, I should have tried this out when I received it. Like most of the others, the reading was fast, but it was wrong, every time.. My grandson had a temp, and it said 93 degrees. All I can say is this is not worth a penny!"
3,Just don't trust this little gadget,"Ordinarily, these little gadgets retail for around fifty a piece. Somehow, some way, I managed to get one for 15 through Amazon. I'd intended to abandon the rectal thermometer, and move toward something a little more humane - at least that was the idea. However, minute to minute, there can be as much as a degree plus swing in the reading. Take the temperature, 99.7. Take it (literally) a minute later, 100.8. Really? Same ear - a minute apart. And, dear Vicks, it isn't worth your time to attribute the variance to misuse. The directions are clear - pull the ear a little so that you can completely insert and get a straight shot down the ear canal, etc. etc. I'll keep it - it was 15 bucks, and if I can somehow rig it to perform correctly, then fine. But so far, I just don't trust this little gadget."
1,inconsistent,"terrible product. inconsistent readings. reads too low. take temp 5 times in a row, and will range from 94-99 degrees!"
4,"Good, if you know how to use it!","I bought this Thermometer after seeing the easiness with which the nurses take the temp of my kid.. But only after owning it, I realized it need to have an expertise to use the item!!! If you won't use it in a proper way, it won't show you the right temp!! I still don't know whether I am using it right or not, so each time I have to get the help of the conventional thermometer to double check my kid's temp!!! It always show about 1 degree deviation, often less than the actual.... I won't say it is a bad item, but the way you use it makes the difference......."
1,Hypothermia or Fever?,"Typing in all caps, with hundreds of exclamation points would not convene my dislike for this product. My daughter clearly has a fever, she is burning up when I took her temperature it was 93.4... huh? she is borderline hypothermic? I don't think so. This thing is a piece of junk. I took my temperature multiple times and never got the same reading twice."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THERMOMETER. WHEN I RECEIVED IT, IT DID NOT WORK!! THE BATTERIES WERE IN IT AND THEY WERE CORRODED AND STUCK AND HAD BEEN THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME. THIS THERMOMETER IS JUNK!!!"
1,Corroded Batteries Inside,"I purchased this because of the great price, and what I got was a broken package and corroded batteries. It needless to say did not work at all."
1,Inaccurate readings,I have only ever been able to get accurate readings on this thermometer once. The rest of the time the readings tend to be on the low side and can fluctuate by a number of degrees from readings taken within seconds of each other. It is hard to even get a ballpark estimate of what the temperature might be in these instances. I have tried using it with the probe covers as recommended and in desperation tried it without the covers. I still got inaccurate readings. I would spend my money on something else.
5,"Good Card, Good Acceleration","Well, I got this card for $50 bucks at ebay, with some canadian guy, however, the card resulted to include everything but the bundled games! but, who cares! Seems like I have 'em all except the Star WArs game. I had the first Audigy, and you can hear a little difference in the sound (Loved my first Live! Sound Card, and then Audigy), but when I saw the real difference was on hardware acceleration, its sound processor seems to be very fast. I have an 8 speaker wireless system from Creative also, I like classic music, oldies, rock, and balads, my music hears great, and my games rock! It's worth every penny, but lucky for me I only paid 50 bucks hahaha. (As a matter of fact, I wouldn't pay over 100 bucks for the card 'cause I had an Audigy :P)"
1,DO NOT BUY,"This book was poorly made, not worth your money. i don't know [who] wrote this but he really needs to go back to english classes. The book was not put in order. They just took the diablo II computer game and put it in a book without worrying about the rules of 3rd D&D.;Do yourself a favor...Don't buy this book!"
5,History should be taught like this,"A real page turner. From the excitement of creating a new country to the complexities of a war that divides families, Drinkard brings history to life in an exciting and powerful manner. Every chapter could have been longer. Rebels,Indians,pirates,Colonial armies,mercenaries,politics and love; New York seemed as rich in character and diversity as it does now. Drinkard could pick up these characters for another round. I hope he does."
2,Errors and anachronisms,"Although the story is well told and there is no faulting the writing itself, there is much in the way of historical error and anachronism -- particularly in descriptions of clothing, uniforms, and military accouterments. I am afraid these were so numerous they fully distracted from my enjoyment of the book."
4,A uniquely American novel.,"Even if you don't believe the hyperbolic Pynchoncover blurb, check out this extraordinary novel.Erickson takes us to Paris, where Thomas Jeffersonrapes his young slave, Sally Heming. Sally then becomesthe weft of the novel, weaving togetherthe theme (the relationship between love and freedom) and the diverse time-locales, including turn-of-the-millenium Berlin and an unspecifieddystopian city at the foot of an active volcano.Erickson's prose is razor-sharp, and his fictionaluniverse is both complex and internally consistent, making this novel a rewarding read."
5,"Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality.","A previous reviewer ventured the bold opinion that Steve Erickson cannot write.This authority has a point. Steve Erickson cannot write in the same way that Bob Dylan cannot sing.If you care to be somewhat challenged (Mr. Erickson has a reputation as one of those difficult writers, but he's not really that difficult, if you're in the habit of paying attention to the book that you're reading), and you ache to understand both your nation and your soul, I suggest that you read this book. It will lead you down a path you do not expect.Perhaps the most profound American novel of the 20th century."
2,"Out of print for good reason, I suspect","Erickson can't write. He really can't. There's some vaguely memorable scenes (more like figments of scenes), but the writing is so poor it really isn't worth it."
2,A few good songs,"This CD has three or four good songs. Most of it, however, are songs by others to which this artist attempts to apply his style. His rendition of ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"" is absolutely the worst I have ever heard. I mainly purchased this CD because it was cheap and it allowed me to get the three or four originals by this artist (e.g. Borrowed Angel) that I really do like. Accordingly, if you want the few good hits this artist made at a cheap price then this CD is for you."
5,Great memories,I had forgotten about Mel Street andhow much I enjoy his music. It was goodto find this CD at a great price.
5,THANK YOU!!!!!!!!,"I used this book and scored a 770 on the march 12 sat critical reading section. A massive improvment from my original 580. The most helpful part of this book was the explinations. Each one adds on to your understanding of exactly what CR tests and they REALLY help! When I answered a question I thought I had gotten right but I had really gotten wrong, (or questions I didn't know/guessed on) the explinations really made me understand and let me tackle questions like that in the future. This book offers a great deal of quite realistic practice. The vocab list was very helpful and many words on the test that were in this book, including the really hard ones! I recomend the offical guide with this book for real questions!"
5,Everyone Needs to Know the ABC's,This is a great up to date book about college! There really are not that many books out there which grasp the real life of a college student. I just graduated college and wish I had this book going in. It's full of useful and clever information that any Freshman should know about! Vicki Salemi did a great job with this book! I recommend it to any college or soon to be college student!
4,Satisfied Customer!!,Great read!! Captures the reality of life on campus (no holds barred....)and provides lots of helpful hints. Sent to my niece who will be considering colleges in the next year or so and received rave reviews back. A must read for anyone heading off to college life!!!!
4,Good,"I really enjoyed this album, not quite as much as Healing or Father from the same series but it still is good mood music. I let it play during prayer time."
2,"Interesting speculation, but....","I bought this book based on the almost uniformly positive reviews here. I was disappointed. The thesis is mind-bending and interesting, but the arguments are sloppy, unreferenced, ignore major issues, and go into great detail about secondary ramifications. And in the even more speculative later chapters, the authors slip into ridiculing anyone who doesn't ""get it."""
3,Great battery,"best battery life in a shaver.i use an electric shaver only 1-2 times a week as i perfer a blade but i have had this for 2 years, and battery is still strong with no memory problems. you can shave while its charging.the foil did recently brake, and cost as much as new to replace.however it never got a close shave, and would occasionaly pull hair even when new, you would have to work it hard to get more than a marginal job."
2,Definitely not for adults!,"OK, I bought this shaver from a site that did not call it a ""young men's shaver."" Just shaver. It is definitely not going to give you a good shave shave if you are over the age of oh.. 18. I am 28 and can not for the life of me get a clean shave with this thing. I will stick to my Gilette Mach 3."
1,Disturbing Read,"I normally like books about the supernatural, witches, etc. I loved Harry Potter and my kids and I have also enjoyed the witch books by Eva Ibbottson. However, I found this book to be very disturbing.It wasn't the one brother's death that bothered me, or the fact that his twin brother is trying to talk to him one last time. What bothered me was that I felt children were being encouraged to turn to the occult to deal with death.In one of the other reviews, a teacher said she had read the book to her class. If my child had been in her class, I would have been extremely upset. When you write a book about witches for children, there needs to be a sense that this is make-believe. The Magic Hour did not do that.If you get this book for your children, please read it yourself before you give it to them."
2,Unremarkable album,"Lazlo Bane's 1996 remake of Men At Work's ""Overkill"" is one of the best remakes of the 1990's. Featuring a cameo vocal by the former 'Men At Work' frontman, this version of the song is clearly a superior rock-and-roll version of the original. That said, the rest of ""11 Transistor"" is generally a passable but unremarkable garage-rock album. There are a couple of above-average tracks (only slightly above-average), but on the whole the disc is not a memorable production. Certainly nothing on the album comes close to the polished ""Overkill"" remake.Lazlo Bane's frontman was a former member of ""School of Fish"", a band who's first album, the self-titled ""School of Fish"", is still one of my personal favorites 10 years after its release.I suggest saving your money on ""11 Transistor"" and instead making an investment in ""School of Fish"" and look for the 1997 promotional CD single of ""Overkill"" which includes three variations of this excellent remake."
3,Lazlo Bane: 11 transistor,"Sadly I was a little dissapointed in this CD. There are a small handfull of good songs, nothing to scream about, and a whole lot of pitiful songs on this CD. I may need to listen to it again, but to listen to it once was hard enough. Sorry Lazlo, I really like your 'Superman' song, in fact, I love it and was hoping the CD would have it on it and other songs like it."
2,You get what you see!,"Not much,we have had it up about 6 months in a spare bath we rarely use,the part that hangs on the door is way too big,we have an average door.I was looking at it a few days ago and its warped like it shifted somehow."
4,Great poetry,"It is impossible to translate poetry accurately from one language to another. We may be able to translate the sentences literally, but we will miss the subtleties of the form, and the way words are chosen for secondary meanings. Alternatively, we can attempt to emulate the form of the original, making it harder to understand in modern English.Hollander does the latter. This is necessarily a compromise. However, it is as good a rendering of the poetic form as one could get, while still being intelligible. Even so, it is not as easy to understand as a translation to plain prose.The answer to the dilemma is to read both types of translation, along with the original if possible. If you take the trouble to become familiar with one of the easier translations like Larrington first, Hollander's is a good way of getting the feel of the poetry before tackling the Old Norse original.SweynThe Rune Primer: A Down to Earth Guide to the Runes"
3,has its charm,"I did not like this book when I first picked it up. The translator complicates things in an effort to keep the form of the poetry pleasing. He makes no effort to write in plain English and uses words I could not find in an ordinary dictionary. After further reading, his sense of sound and rhythm are wonderful. I would suggest keeping a very good dictionary on hand, but it is worth the effort."
3,better translations are available,Hollander sacrifices accuracy in an attempt to capture the form of the original poetry. He is also fond of using archaic English words - which makes the translation more difficult to read. The book actually includes a glossary of the words used in the translation!First time readers of the Poetic Edda would probably be better off with Larrington's translation.
3,The Poetic Edda,"I got this translation as my first copy of the Poetic Edda, and I would not recommend it to a beginner. At first I thought it was because I was unfamiliar with the poems that I had so much difficulty understanding it.I got Larrington's translation, and it is much more readable for a beginner. Nevertheless, I find myself missing the poetic attempts of Ms. Hollander, and especially the footnote, rather than endnote, format.I give her credit for making the poetic attempt, and I like the format, but if you actually want to understand the content, I'd go with a different translation."
4,LOTA - Fellowship of the Rings,"A Great opening to the now famous Rings trilogy, with extended scenes and a wealth of additional behid the scenes information."
4,A twist in the tale.,"Yu Watase, Fushigi Yugi: Enemy (Viz Publicatins, 1994)Here we are at volume 10 of Fushigi Yugi. Watase throws a minor twist in here that some of the fans seem less than thrilled with. Eh, well, you can't please everyone.Miaka and the Suzaku celestial warriors have been separated for reasons that can't be revealed without spoiling book nine. Long story short, Miaka ends up sick and being cared for by an old couple whose son, Miaka is convinced, is Seiryu celestial warrior Amiboshi returned to life...If this issue slips a notch in quality from the last one, it's because the whole Amiboshi/not-Amiboshi questino isn't handled all that well; perceptive readers will know the answer to that one long before Watase actually answers it. Other than that, though, everything's going along swimmingly. *** &#65533;"
1,Ehhh....,"I LOVE Fushigi Yugi, but this book wasn't my favorite... It was really dramatic, lots of action, and every page left you with a cliff hanger, but it was borderline cliche... I hope the next book gets back to the storyline, as this one was a big drawn out arguement over who ways gonna de-virginize (thats not even a WORD) Miaka. I would recomend this book to any FY fan, though. But don't let your parents read it... o.O; mine were like, ""Er......soap opera?"""
5,death to boring music,"I truly enjoy this CD. While most electronic music has becomestale and predictable, this CD offers no dull moments. Ranging from freak tech to jazz down tempo, this album combines original music with various samples. Tracks like ""connected"" (my favorite)and ""music for children"" feature female vocals and incorporate numerous layers of synth and guitar. Other songs like ""forgive"" and ""for $ale"" lean a little to the darker side of things while still maintaining a musical freshness. Down tempo cut ""Haunted City"" can only be described as Miles Davis playing trumpet over ghetto beats and sirens. The last track, ""Muzack for the Death Star"" sounds like a crazy, whacked out Atari 2600...fun stuff! All in all it's great to hear an artist release music that isn't boring. Death to boring music!"
4,"Pretty nice stuff, would like to hear more","I heard parts of this CD on the local college radio underground show and it sounded good so I got it. I generally liked most of the tracks - except for a couple, but then, I never like ALL of the tracks on everything, ya know, picky genius that I am :). If you like Kid Koala or Add-N-to-X or maybe some Beck/Dust Bros. sounds, you should like this. Not bad for what I assume is a first CD by this artist."
1,CDR,"Iwas disappointed because I thought I was to receive 10 CD's in a package, but only one CD arrived. I returned it, and went to Best Buy instead."
5,Great great book,This is an excelent book for anyone who embraces the catholit religion. It is a very beautiful narrative of the convertion process of a protestant couple. Great time reading it !!!
1,Intellectually dishonest,"Having read Scott's book, it occurred to me that Scott missed the true meaning of the central points of reformed theology. I researched Dr. Gerstner's follow-up comments to Hahn's book, and indeed, Gerstner feels Hahn was rebelling against something he never completely understood to begin with. Furthermore, there was no hint of humility in his writing. His attitude was, ""I was right then, and I am right now."" Sadly, he has turned away from a personal testimony that was rich with witnessing and sharing the gospel to a practice of self-serving theologizing. I feel sorry for Scott and Kim."
1,A sad tale from a man who turned his back on truth...,"Mr. Hahn's book reads like a biographical infomercial for Roman Catholicism, but astute Protestant readers will be able to conclude that Scott never really understood the Reformed Evangelical faith he once claimed to embrace. Sadly, he left the truth and embraced a false theology, since that time he has become an active apologete for the Roman Church.Don't be fooled by the rhetoric, Mr. Hahn was convinced by his own presuppositions and his own faulty understanding of what Reformed theology teaches. The tale of struggle and transformation that Hahn weaves comes accross as a saccharin icing for that sad process. God willing, someday he'll write another book entitled ""From Rome to the Truth"".My advice? Buy Sproul's ""Faith Alone"" instead!"
5,Spectacular book that hits the heart of Catholicicm - truth,"Do not...I repeat DO NOT read this book if you have any intention of NOT converting to Catholicism.This book, written by a professor of theology will tell you why you should be Catholic and answersvirtually any question a serious doubter would ask...buy it for your friends and relatives. This book isan excellant Christmas gift."
5,Excellent book on journey to the Catholic Church,"I bought this excellent book a couple years ago. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Opened my eyes to the beauty of the Catholic Church. Being a Catholic of some 25 years I didn't know what I was missing until I devoured the book. Since then, I have bought and given many copies of the book to friends and relatives. The book is still a favourite read of mine."
5,Rome Sweet Home,Awesome book. Helped me to get re-excited about my Catholic faith. Also gave me some great background on defending and promoting my faith for my fallen away family members.
3,Pretty good,When they learned of my conversion a number of my Baptist relatives were horrified. At the time I was neither willing nor able to explain to them why I chose another way. Rome Sweet Home has come in handy. Although the Hahns frequently get too gooey for my taste the book does a pretty good job of explaining why a hardcore Baptist could even think of looking into the Catholic faith.
5,A great book for RCIA programs and non-catholics,"Scott and Kimberly Hahn's journey was so enlightening to one is in the process of converting to Catholicism. Dr. Hahn manages to tell a great story and educate at the same time. I learned more about Catholicsm in this book than I had in 10 RCIA sessions! A great book for non-Catholics, as they will see the Church explained in simple terms."
5,The Truth Will Set You Free,"Former Presbyterian minister, Scott Hahn lays it all on the line in this wonderful book. For those who have heard Hahn's audiotape of his conversion (available free from the Mary Foundation) much of this will not be new material. But it's well worth reading anyway.Hahn's story tells how he came to realize Luther's errors and discover the Truth of Catholicism. A voracious scholar and reader, the reader finds himself being as convinced as Hahn along the way. If you enjoy exciting conversion stories this one is for you!Hahn's wife Kimberly later converted to Catholicism as well."
5,ROME Sweet Home is a eye opener about how Protestants view Catholics,"This book is an easy read, because it is in a unique format where the husband gives his view at a particular time in their mutual journey of conversion to Catholicism, which is all positive, and then it is followed by all of her fears and out right horror as to the direction he is going. I recommend this book because it gives Catholics a better understanding of their own faith, and also a deep appreciation for the faith of protestants, and how Catholics have much to learn from them."
5,beautiful,"This book is beautiful and awe-inspiring. It has made me appreciate my religion on a whole new level. As a cradle Catholic, I realize that I have been taking many things for granted. Mass is an amazing thing. There is a guaranteed miracle everyday! Anyone who reads this with an open mind and, more importantly, an open heart will soon find themselves reading his other books."
5,"The Church, pillar and foundation of the truth","It's hard to describe the sentiments that fill the soul upon reading this book. I am just simply awed. It confirms what I have sensed all this time. For years, having studied theology on my own just for the interest it arouses although I'm an engineer, I've always been amazed at how the Catholic Faith demonstrates cogency and is intellectually fool-proof. Nothing in it goes against reason although much of it leaves reason breathless as it discovers truths which it could not have discovered by itself alone. Scott Hahn's story strikes me to the core as it shows how any person who makes an honest inquiry into the Catholic Faith is bound to see it cogent and intellectually compelling. And how it fills the heart with hope. It may not demand an immediate submission of the mind but it is certainly a preparation for the reception of the gift of faith. This book is a must for all those who would like to begin this inquiry into the Catholic Church."
5,A MUST READ!,"Each time I feel ""dry"", all I have to do is to pick up this book and read Scott Hahn's journey to Catholicism. This book has never failed to ignite my soul. A MUST read."
4,Scott Hahn's moving conversion story to Roman Catholicism,This is the story of Scott Hahn's conversion from outspoken anti-Catholic Protestant to defender of the Catholic faith. It is a moving conversion story.
4,Easy reading,"I'm a convert from Protestantism to Catholicism so I can relate to many of the themes found in this book. It is an inspiring journey written in plain English, however don't expect it to get too technical. It is not an apologetics book."
3,Good place to start,"This book is a good one to start with if you are seeking stories of those who have converted from Protestantism to Catholicism. As one in the process of making the journey back to Catholicism this book provided me with encouragement for the struggles and conflicts that lie ahead. Kimberly's act of journalizing her thoughts, questions, fears, frustration and anger during her journey is perhaps a good idea for anyone going through the process. Her journal of prayer and conversation with the Lord were the most precious parts of the book, to me."
3,A delightful read of a difficult if not tumultuous jorney.,"Scott and Kimberly Hahn have provided a guide to the turmoil that a conversion of faith can cause an individual, family and friends. This book maps the jorney of each partners struggle to a truth that they knew would eventually overwhelm their lives and livelihood. After reading this book I think back to their trying times and commitment to God often and with great respect. It is a must read for any newcomer to the church."
2,Written Too Much Towards Evangelicals,"Although Scott's story is interesting, I had a hard time relating to it (even as a Protestant who is going through the process of converting to Catholicism). He assumes the reader has a thorough background in Protestant theology and will be familiar with the ins and outs of delicate biblical arguments.Each chapter is split, with 3/4 of the chapter being Scott's story and the last 1/4 being Kimberly's version. This can get confusing when trying to remember who is talking.Personally, not recommended."
2,Preachy?,"Interesting, but rather preachy. I think it's a well written description of a 'coming of age' of a sorts..."
3,Why so much anger?,I am amazed at the anger of those who give this book one star. I haven't read this book. Hahn must have hit a nerve with this one. I think I will need to read it.
2,Shallow,"One couple's story about their spiritual journey from the evangelical protestant church to the Roman Catholic church. This book reads like it was taken from transcripts of speeches by the Hahns. There's not much meat to it. The book seems to function more as an advertisement or PR tool for Scott Hahn's books and tapes, than anything. The book briefly goes over how, one by one, the Hahns overcome difficult issues of the Catholic faith until one day Scott, then later Kimberly, each convert. The reader is provided with very little explanation of how their minds and hearts were changed. For example, Scott talks about one day just picking up a rosary to pray. How does a ""former Anti-Catholic"" make that leap? Another example is how he comes to believe in the power of a relic of a dead person, which he implies (but does not explain) was instrumental in his wife's conversion. Lots of similar leaps are made and in the end, the book is merely an unconvincing collection of vignettes and anecdotes."
4,God reveals Himself to those who search for Him in TRUTH.,"The Hahns sharing of their journey to catholism has moved me a lot. It is sad to see those who are most critical of the Catholic faith have not really taken the time to study and understand what catholics believe in. Thank you Scot and Kim, you have made me love the Church more than ever. God bless you both!"
4,Nice story,It was a nice story of how a couple found Catholocism. In their quest many aspects as well as comparasins are made of Catholic views. It shed light on some questions many Catholics and non Catholics may have about our faith. It is hard to relate to their lives however beacuse they were exrememly religious people but the stroy was nice. It left me feeling lucky to be a born Catholic so I am going to have to recomend this one.
5,Loved it,I met Dr. Hahn at church when he was speaking at the request of our Life Teen group. THEN I bought the book. I think it was the fastest I ever read a book. I couldn't put it down. I just loved it.
5,Rome Sweet Home by Scott & Kimberly Hahn,Awesome book! I've ordered multiple copies and have been lending them out to family and friends. Dr. Hahn was a staunch anti-Catholic Presbyterian minister and is a biblical scholar who went on a quest for the truth. He is a modern day St. Paul. I highly recommend reading this book!
5,The Hahn's testimony is a true treasure,"I am so thankful for Scott and Kimberly. I know I'm not alone in owing a great deal to them for my own conversion to the Church. Captivating and emotional prose, everyone will experience their story first hand. This book will give courage to all those considering conversion, especially those who have family members that have already converted. A must read and a Catholic classic."
5,A superb and inspiring read,"I found this book an absolutely compelling read and finished it in one day. Once I had picked it up, I could not put it down. It has left me with a deeper appreciation and love of my Catholic faith, for which I am grateful to Scott and Kimberly. I can't wait to get my hands on some of their tapes.I find the sort of Bible punching, blind faith, muscular Christianity from whence the Hahns started their journey deeply unattractive, as I suspect do many. It is the face of the Reformed faith which I believe has contributed much to the collapse of formal religion in the West. As the Irishman said when asked the way to Dublin, ""If I was going to Dublin, I wouldn't have started from here.""However, I made a similar journey to the Hahns forty years ago, starting from agnosticism. I have not once in those forty years regretted my decision to become a Catholic."
4,How an anti-Catholic becomes pro-Catholic,"An effective tool for Catholic apologetics. If you are an anti-Catholic Christian, you must check this book out in order to determine whether you really want to remain anti-Catholic or not"
4,ok,"I bought this book after being interested in Hahn's story after reading an article on the internet. One should realize the scope of this book before reading it. It is a nice inspirational testimony of Scott and Kimberly's journey to Roman Catholicism from a prior protestant understanding of Christianity. That said, if one is looking to see the great arguments laid out in details for why one is better off in Roman Catholicism, then you should look elsewhere. For what the book attempts to lay out and present (the difficulties and happiness that comes with a conversion process to Roman Catholicism) it does a good job. 4 stars."
5,Very good book,"""Rome Sweet Home"" is the best conversion story I have yet to read. One reason, simply, is because its easy to read. As a woman who is studying Catholicism myself, I identified with Kimberly Hahn's emotional struggle. Anyone who thinks she is being melodramatic, hasn't been raised in a devout Protestant (anti-Catholic) home. It is a roller coaster of emotions. This is the first Catholic conversion book I've read where I didn't get alittle bored before I got through with it. I highly recommend ""Rome Sweet Home"" to anyone looking into the Catholic Church."
5,Inspiring Tear Jerker,I loved this book. As a recent convert myself it really spoke to me. The info on how scripture aligns with the Church was very informative. I am getting copies of this for my non Catholic friends!
5,A Book Everyone Should Read.,"This book is the best at presenting major Catholic beliefs and the scripture that defends them. It is told by relating the personal conversions of Scott and Kimberly Hahn. It is a story of prayer, struggle, and enlightenment. A wonderful read, very thoughtful and thought-provoking."
1,Triteness and anecdotes,"Married to a Catholic it was suggested I read this book. I don't know if someone thought I would instantly convert after reading it, or if it was merely a recommendation from a fan of the work. Either way, I read it and was underwhelmed. I found it filled with trite anecdotes and personal observations but nothing of substance. I quickly tired of the emotionalism the Hahn's keep piling onto the tale of their journey. It becomes boring, maudlin, and very unconvincing.I also have to say that Scott's observations on the Catholic Church before his conversion left me shaking my head. For a supposed religious scholar, his knowledge seems incredibly shallow. And even now, his arguments are unconvincing and quite flimsy.I have to say this comes across as more of a PR piece for the Catholic Church than any kind of honest exercise"
3,Too Much Potatoes -- Too Little Meat,"This book does take a different tack in that it addresses US and Canadian (especially the latter) roles in the Battle of the Atlantic. However, it fails to address in a meaningful way the personalities and characters involved. Walker, Horton, Gretton, King, Doenitz -- they need to be probed in a narrative that isn't a pure biography about a single person. The battle is about them, and those they led. Too much weather, tactics and technology. Too little about the people themselves."
1,No Husker Du?!,"I was totally disappointed, mainly due to my being mislead. I had intended to purchase a Husker Du CD, but... My mistake!This CD didn't make up for it though. Not impressed. Heard 1 or 2 decent songs, but nothing spectacular."
4,Masterpiece!,What more can be said about this collection that hasn't already been said? Wonderful collection of entertainment. This books' only downfall may be its small typeface... Otherwise a great compilation for a great price.
2,difficult to read,"This book is condensed, I mean two pages printed on one page so the lettering is very small and none of the original art work is included. I did not realize when I bought it that the letters would be small. I also thought the original art work would be included. It's not bad if you want to read it with a magnifying glass."
4,Oz series L. Frank Baum,"It's a great book, and appears unedited for the movie, following more closely to the original writings. Only problem is the stlye of print is very small, I would not recommend this for older readers, or people with bad vision. The two column printing does make it a bit better to deal with though. All in all, a great buy, and nice for all types of home libaries"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Although I was thrilled to see the entire Oz collection together at last, I was terribly disappointed with this edition.The print is too small and the book seems to be ""all work and no play."" I mean that it is so intent on getting the stories together that there is no time for little things that make children's books good, i.e. pictures. The binding is rather cheap looking and the page quality is see through.Save your money and buy a good hardcover collection."
3,"Oz series is awesome, this book not so much..",The stories of course were great but I think the book shoulda been a hardcover especially since its so long and a bigger size then normal. I also didn't really care for the way they had the words so small and how they had two columns on one page. It was basically liek they were combining two pages on one which woulda been ok if the words were bigger. I also felt like there were some details and parts of some stories missing so they could make it shorter. I feel that way because I have read all of these books in the Oz series before and I felt like there were parts missing. Otherwise it was great reading!
2,Oz books,I was disappointed in this book. All 15 books are squished together with tiny print and no pictures.
3,Complete Collection in very tiny print,"I purchased this book for my mother as a Christmas gift. After it arrived in the mail, I noticed that the book's print was in a small font, smaller than a normal book. The chapters also weren't separated as in a normal book with a separator, they kind of ran together and I believe I saw one chapter that began in the middle of a page. Since it was so close to Christmas, I went ahead and gave it to my mother but told her that I would send it back and find her another since the print was so small. She was so thrilled to get the collection that she refused to let me return it; however, I know she's going to have a tough time reading it. If I had purchased the book for myself, I would have definitely returned it. This is a soft back book and I was not impressed with it's quality."
5,Great collection of Oz stories by Frank Baum !!!!!!,"For years I thought there was only the Wizard of Oz book but I was talking with a friend who said there were many other stories. So I went to Amazon and found this collection of 15 books by Frank Baum, the author of the Wizard of Oz. Each story is as unique and well written as the Wizard of Oz. The movie captured the essence of the Wizard of Oz but you get a lot more detail in the book story. And you get a great cast of characters like Ozma, Mombi, Tip, Thing, and so many more. Great uplifting stories for children (and adults too) I am very glad I bought this book."
1,Be Aware of Printing Error,"The book I received (hardcover edition) seemed fine, but once I opened it I saw that the first five or six pages were the title page, copyright, dedication, and table of contents from a completely different book, ""The Biggest Bangs"" by Jonathan Katz. The correct book start just after than and the rest of it seemed fine, but be aware of this printing error because I'm sure mine was not the only one like that.As others have mentioned, the printing was a bit small but I did not think it was difficult to read. It did have the look and presentation of a textbook, so it probably would not be enjoyed being read by young children."
1,A first for me from Amazon,This is the first Item I have every purchased from Amazon that I have not been satisfied. The book is very difficult to read with extremely tiny font. The book is written in two to a page columns similar to newspaper printing. There are no illustrations which are normally in any edition of Frank L. Baum books. The book is of poor quality including binding and paper. This book is not up to the normal Amazon quality of books. I hope they will allow me to return it.
5,Garfield DVD and Pooky Toy,"My daughter loves this DVD and expecially the Pooky toy. The Pooky toy is softer than I had expected and is great. The DVD is of mostly Garfield's dreams and were alot that we had already seen on the Garfield season 1 and 2 DVDs, but there were also some that we hadn't seen. However, it is good to have the dreams and schemes grouped together like that. I would definitly recommend this product if you love Garfield and Pooky (of course)."
4,"Garfield & Friends ""Dreams & Schemes"" DVD w/Mini-Beanie Plush Pooky toy",A great bargain price for a future collectible!Arrived in perfect condition & in good time!
5,Tragic Injustice,"This is a tragic story of injustice, especially of the law, lawyers. It is really hard to believe that something like this could happen. I am glad that justiceand truth prevailed even though it took a terrible lone time and a devastation of lives."
5,A great loss at an early age,If your love gentle country rock - this guy's the real deal.......Safe enough to buy - even if you haven't heard of him.
3,"Where did you go, B. W.?","Most of the songs are run of the mill, but there are two songs that will reverberate over and over in your mind, drawing you back to just listen to them. B.W. might be mundane, but these two need to be in the Hall of Fame. I won't say which two, just listen....."
1,Not good,"I did not buy this here, but from another distributor, but I am SO disappointed with the Soho spice board. They canisters are VERY hard to open - the little plastic band in between the top and bottom is too tight. If you remove the plastic band, the canister doesn't stay closed. IMO the band could have been a retrofit for improperly manufactured canisters. I like to cook and wanted to love this - it is beautiful and you can put it up right by your stove or wherever you need them, but for people with even normal strength in their hands, the canisters do not open easily. If you have any hand problems, such as any arthritis it will be near impossible to open them to put in more spice.The metallic wall panel is fine, so I may try to get some magnetic canisters from another company to use."
4,"Comedic, Neurotic Love Dance","This show was one of the most enjoyable & entertaining shows in the late 80s-early 90s era. It had two strong, well-matched lead actors in Jaime Lee Curtis & Richard Lewis--who exuded an endearing & powerful romantic chemistry and charm together. The show also had a talented supporting cast that provided the icing on the cake for this show. The dialogue was sharp, funny, & often surprisingly poignant. I am looking forward to the rest of the series coming out. This show is a winner!!"
1,not pleased,second time I purchased this dvd and second time it does not have all episodes on it. won't do it again!
4,Good for families with tween girls,"I gave this to my sister (age 12) for Christmas and she really enjoys it. The dancing, music, costumes, etc. were very popular with her. It was a movie our whole family enjoyed together."
3,movie,i am sorry i cannot review this item as i haven't received this shipment of the 2 dvd's as of today and am not pleased.
4,Family,I received the movie the Cheetah Girls 2 within a week in great condition. I'm very pleased with the movie and the service.
5,Cheetahlicious,This was a great deal it came in a weeks time. It was well packed and the movie is fabolous. I really enjoyed my purchase from Amazon.
1,missing movie,"When my granddaughter opened the sealed packet, there was no movie inside. The box was empty."
2,Just Doesn't Live Up To Expectations,"I have been a very huge fan of Toto since thier wonderful debut CD right up to thier last studio effort , ""Mindfields"" , and when I heard that a new Toto CD was being released in March I was very excited. Well , I have listened to ""Falling In Between"" at least 4 times now in it's entirety and I must say I am a little disappointed. Sure , ""Bottom Of Your Soul"" and the title track are vintage Toto , but the rest of the CD is just nothing what I have expected from Toto the past 26 years. I had read reviews before the CD was released that this was a great CD , but I just can't see that here. Hopefully on thier next outing we can expect Toto at thier best instead of music that fans are not accustomed to. Sorry guys..."
3,I enjoy Toto however,"I thought that this cd could have been a little better. This cd does not have the Toto sound, its almost as if they tried a new sound. The cd is ok."
4,Almost perfect,"I've enjoyed this labor of love for several years now. The musicianship is journeyman-grade throughout: repeated listenings open up the ear to lush changes, and complex textures to match. There is old-school talent and chops at work here; nothing was phoned in. They are a better band now than they were at the time of Toto IV.Still, I can't bring myself to award the album a full five stars. If Toto only had equally sharp instincts to sidestep wince-inducing lyrics, like ""I'd crawl across the water just to get away from you."" At other times, the lyrics amount to latter-day protest music, which may explain why it was available overseas far ahead of its release in the US.I'm willing to forego all this, and just let the music take me where it will, to some beautiful places indeed. I'd encourage you to give it a chance as well."
4,TOTO WITH AN EDGE,"Man, these guys are good! Everything from the songwriting, arrangements, production and musicianship is in top form. This CD has a great marriage of styles and still carries a strong and unified sound that doesn't veer off course into chaos - it's a very cohesive yet diverse album.Really solid, and sounds great cranked up. Some cool special guest musicians make for a bonus treat also. Highly recommended."
5,Toto-Reclassified,"It's really difficult to categorize Toto's style of music but to tell you honestly it takes a wide sense of musical appreciation to understand the complexity of their music. In fact, there's nothing complex in their music. They're just having fun!!! These men are truly, great experienced session artists and have a vast array of musical styles in their repertoire. Their resumes are outstanding in the world of music. From blues to rock, from jazz to fusion, from r&b to funk, these guys are the elements of what they call ""progressive."" To call this a ""bland"" project is demeaning. In my opinion, this is an excellent record. Welcome back, boys!!!"
3,Toto in rock mode...,"This is certainly not an ""instant classic"" as another reviewer put it. If you're looking for power ballads and the older Toto style, this CD will likely be a let-down for you. If you're into the drift torward the harder rock-edged stuff Toto has done more recently, you might enjoy this album..."
3,Pretty good product,"I quickly lost interest in reading this book. It is a bit too complicated for my understanding, so I didn't read very much of it. Maybe someday I will, but not any time soon."
2,Outdated,"May have been a first class book, but the kindle edition is outdated and urgently needs updating.While much of the stuff in the book is useful, some links are hopelessly useless, and for 2012 a lot of GPS stuff has improved a lot since the book was written.It is also very US-centric, and that needs clarifying. For example, the book is not clear that the WAAS is ONLY available for the US and nearby areas, so much of the accuracy claims are irrelevant for most of the world.However, for newcomers it does provide an electronic option and is written in an easy to read style. Like many electronic books it suffers from a poor ability to move/ flick quickly back and forth over more than a few pages to recheck material or come back to reread areas to recheck how to do stuff. A hard copy book does make that easier.But overall, a lot of interesting information that is, useful. There are other books around on GPS usage, so this is just average."
2,An entire book on GPSs?,"The actual GPS is so self explanatory, couldn't believe a full size book is needed to use one ! For 1 cent I just had to see it.... garage sale or blue can soon."
4,not for dummies,The Book is for dummies. You have to have a pretty good understanding of maping and electronics to understand what he is trying to tell you.Uther than that it is well written.
3,Bought it years ago and not very useful,"I have bought many dummy books and still have many. This was not one of the best, but okay for those not current on tech."
2,Not for outdoor beginners,"This book sends people out in the field with a GPS but without the knowledge of what to do when the batteries die or the electronics fail (it happens!). If you really are a ""dummy,"" you should also learn the basics of navigation before relying on an electronic device that can leave you stranded. Better choices that are very readable: The Land Navigation Handbook (new edition includes GPS info) and Wilderness Navigation (less detailed)."
3,UNC Children Set - Be aware,"I bought this set because number one I am a huge UNC fan and this looked perfect because my nephew can only use the sippy cups with handles. When I got the set however the cup did not have handles, nor was it a sippy cup as pictured. Please change the picture you have for this item. Over the quality was fine, but was extremely dissapointed in the misrepresentation."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"The material is black with a FLOWERY DESIGN. Picture is very misleading. They appear to be sturdy. Returned with no problem, except after 2 months STILL NO CREDIT."
3,Black Parson chairs,The picture is very misleading. The print in the picture seems to be satiny but it is actually not and the design is also different. It was very hard to assemble as the screws were not matching up with the holes. So was not able to screw all of them. One of the chairs is wobbly. Although it does not look bad when I put it around the dining chair.I have ordered 2 more sets and hope they don't have the same problemFor the price though not a bad deal. I could live with these issues - Made in China - What do you expect?
5,An excellent CD from a great trumpet player!!,This is an example of a great trumpet player doing what he does best--jazz trumpet playing with a latin flavor. The result is listening pleasure for those who have been fans of the Tijuana Brass...including me. I highly recommend this CD!
3,Good Background Music,"This fairly recent CD by Herb Alpert is basically good. The mood is definitely right for those moments alone with that special person. Herb mixes some of this trademark trumpet souns with some captivating flugelhorn solos as well.However, the disc as a whole just does not distinguish iself on a track to track basis. In the background, its very nice music. On a song to song basis nothing really stands out as overly spectacular except for the style. Consistent yes, but not quite at the level of Tijuana Brass releases or his disco flavored Rise CD. Fans will like it but new comers might want to start with the Whipped Cream, The Lonely Bull or A Greatest Hits Compilation."
5,One of my favorite recording no one has ever heard! :),"I love this CD, makes me feel good when I listen to it. Great vibe throughout and two REALLY good songs that I can listen to over & over and never get sick of - ONLY GOD KNOWS and PICTURE HER BLUE. But it's ALL good :)"
3,"The Game of Slipknot, Contrast and Critisizm","Countermodernism and Francophone Literary Culture : The Game of Slipknot (New Americanists) by Keith L. WalkerThis book, was not only interesting but also puts you into a better perspecive to look at modern culture. How the world's beliefs and feelings have changes drastically. The main point of this story is about a heavy metal band Slipknot, and angered heavy metal band highly popular by rock/heavy metal fans, as they are considered as Maggots. As a huge fan of them I believe, I may have a different opinion than someone oblivious of the band. Overall I think this book is worth its money. So, if you are ready to take on a farely challenging book and enjoy criticing the modern art of music and culture this is the book for you."
5,Perfectly describing how I feel about kids,"I not a big reader but I just got it tonight and finished it. I am touched by what he says in his book because it's how I am feeling.""...I had this incredible envy of other dads. I would watch them with their kids and wish that somehow I could have that role. It was painful at times because, being gay, I didn't think parenting was in my life plan.""Thanks for writing this book Kevin McGarry. This really helps me."
3,Different than anticipated,"If you are looking for beautiful and pure flute playing as on the Hoppe albums, this is not the album for you. It is like an opera, much of the CD is vocal with no flute whatsoever. Please amazon, put up some sound clips on this one."
5,Cathartic music. A must for the visonary warrier.,"This music was presented as a gift to me by a dear friend. In the mountains of Mexico I finally found the space to listen to it's message of healing....I inturn, presented it also as a gift to a dear sister who could only cry through the whole epic. I took the music to Machu Pichu in June of '98 to experience it's deep resonnance within a sacred site. Tim Wheater brings us a message of surrender and joy..."
1,Tim Weater CD,"Very disappointed with the purchase of this CD. I knew I was receiving a used CD, however, when it arrived it was a demo with 3 songs on it. Also, it smelled like it was sitting in someone's old musty basement for a few years."
4,Better than the First,"I really enjoyed this book. Each Author took you to a different place in the hood.Kashamba Williams story ""The Life of Juicy Brown"" was off the hook. My hat goes off to Kashamba for this one. I never thought that Kashamba could drop such a gritty story about a female. I LOVED IT. Juicy Brown is your typical Around the Way Girl strugglin day to day to make a dollar. But, Juicy has a team of kids that are down for whatever.Thomas Longs story is about Precious Paine. Precious has been through a whole lot in her young life. Everything from losing her mom to trying to find acceptance from her family. Until Precious finds real love her past will always haunt her.LaJill Hunts story is about two friends Lyric and Alicia. Alicia is a good girl gone bad and Lyric is a bad girl gone good.Step into these ladies lives and you'll really get an idea of what it is to be an Around The Way Girl"
4,Around The Way Girls 2,THIS WAS A MUST READ. THIS BOOK WAS BETTER THAN THE FIRST. THE FIRST ONE GOOD BUT THIS WAS EVEN BETTER!!!
5,Chicks with Issues,"This was definitaly betta than the first one. Juicy doesn't care what her kids do, what she does around them, or what they do with their life. As long as she gets money, and they don't hate on her game. Precious had it all, until her mother and father got hooked on drugs. Now she's boostn til she can't stop. Lyric has had her heart broken twice. She trusts no man and plays them all the same. Her father and mother are the only two people she feels know true love. She becomes friends with Alicia and that's where her life changes."
5,A wonderful mystery for children and adults,"This is a truly wonderful book. It is a sweet, descriptive tale of the changes in young girl's (Lucy's) life after her aunt dies, and when she is sent to live with her cousins. She feels as though she doesn't fit in there, and only has one friend to keep her company. Lucy is haunted in many ways, and she feels her life spiral away from her new family and towards her new friend, until she has to choose betweent the present and the past. It is a wonderful read, I loved it as a child and I wish I could find it again."
5,"A huge talent, but got to less attention","Hi. I'm A huge Billy Yates fan for years. His first album is a must. The songs goes straigt to your heart and you gonna love it, even if you isn't a hardcore country fan.Go and buy it!!!!"
2,Dissatisfied,This is more like a pamphlet instead of a book. I will have to do more research regarding this things noted in this book. Mr Hammond is generally a very noted author and advisor on biblical & spritual knowledge.
4,"Very useful for children, much cheaper than an ear thermometer",I bought this as a placeholder when our ear thermometer died. I did not expect that we would continue using it for the next year. It's really easy to tuck under their arm and you don't have to worry about it shifting out of place like a straight thermometer does. The price is reasonable as well. My only complaint is that I wish it had a light.
1,Not accurate.,This was the biggest waste of money. It is waaaay off every time I use it. It's a good thing I double checked with another digital thermometer because this one showed no fever. Even though my daughter was burning up. It happens every time. Even after repositioning it.
1,Beeps aren't accurate - don't buy,"The thermometer beeps quickly, but it's not actually done. If I keep hitting the button it finally reaches a more accurate temperature. My son's fever has been up to 102 but this thermometer will go up to 99 and beep, then after three or more rounds it will finally top out near what my forehead thermometer says. The first beep does come quickly, but it is NOT correct."
1,Do NOT buy this!!!!,"I am a daycare provider and I could tell one my the kids was sick. I took her temp it showed 101 I knew that could not have been right, she felt much hotter. Her mom came within 5 minutes and took her straight to the dr. Her temp was 105!!! It was WAY off! I tried to also use it on my own kids and it does not read accurately either. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,It was never sent. My money was refunded and the order was cancelled.,"Just like I said. They canceled my order for come reason, and I got my money back. No explanation. Weird."
5,loved it,"I just loved it, one of my favorites by Stuart. The hero is just superbly well written and his physical description is great, even the deformity lends to his attractiveness. A modern day gothic in my opinion. wonderful."
2,save your money,"I bought this software hoping to back up my many movies and put some on my hard drive. The software is buggy and in some cases will take close to 6 hours to rip a dvd movie. Any DVD with episodes will not be able to copy and you can forget about copying to a dual layer disk. There is an upgrade for the software that takes away all the options for copying to your hard drive and decreases the chances of a good burn when doing a strait copy. I ended up going with 1clickdvdcopy and have had no problems, it cost a little more but it was worth it in DVD-Rs that i will save from bad burns because of 123 copy dvd."
2,potentially good but no documentation,"Just for the record, I have 123 Copy DVD Gold 2011.If you're a pocket protector wearing nerd like me you can probably figure out how to get it to do whatever you want it to do. If you're normal, stay away.Why the programmers/distributors didn't include a PDF file with how-to instructions befuddles me (or at a minimum have a downloadable instruction file on their web site). Maybe they're alergic to money and profits??"
1,I agree worst ever!!!!!!,"Pass the word to stay away from this product. I have been trying for a week to get this program to work (hours I will never get back)!!! No help from the tech desk. At least anything helpful!!!! They say ""100% Satisfaction Guaranteed""...what a joke! Good luck trying to locate the address to return the disk and receive a refund. Even the tech desk can't seem to answer that question correctly. Guess I have a new $50.00 dollar coaster for my glass!"
1,Worst garbage rip of $50,"I purchased this software and it didnt work out of the box. told me to try a new version. 3 days of battling with them i finally tossed it in the garbage and wrote off the $50 because they were not going to make it easy to give me my money back. The program is full of bugs. I tried it on 3 different computers. same problem - didn't work. There arent any help menus, nor is the support any good. crooks selling crap!"
1,Like Reading the Health Care Bills,"1-2-3-FIRE! This is most useless, confusing junk I've ever wasted money on. First, there is no user's manual, which I believe is due to the fact that its developers don't know how to operate it either. Please don't waste your money, time, or blank DVDs on this. Next, I cannot figure out how to copy previously decoded movie files from my external hard drive. I can use the hard drive to view my movies on my laptop, but would like to create DVDs for backup so my whole family can enjoy them without worrying about scratching or losing the original. At least I will get some use out of the disk when I use it for target practice."
1,'Note for Note' Transcription? I think not,"Frankly, this book is somewhat of a joke to me (and should be to anyone who isn't completely tone deaf). There are omitted riffs and all sorts of inconsistencies throughout the entire book. Somehow the transcriber managed to BS his way through every song, completely overlooking the fact that Stone Gossard employs several open and altered tunings. Some of the leads aren't too bad, but there are some transcribed in completely the wrong position (IE 'Even Flow', which is transcribed in E when it should be D). And what's up with that transcription to 'Deep'? What an incoherent mess! Don't waste your money. This TAB book isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
4,Pearl Jam music!,"Good for some of the notes missed by sounding out, some lyrics are incorrect. Overall pretty good."
3,The publisher should be embarrased.,"All I had to do was look at the Lyrics for Black and I could tell right away little was done to verify the author's work/accuracy.To wit:""Her Legs spread out before me, as her body was there""Ok, Eddie can get a little deep, but give me a break. That makes zero sense whatsoever.The correct Lyric is:""Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay were laid spread out before me as her body once did.""This tells me research was done using internet Lyric sites, half of which or more have this lyric wrong, instead of proper research.I give it 3 stars because I'm sure it has 3 stars worth of info, but damn. Hal Leonard should be embarrassed."
5,Fun for you and the kids,We were looking for something to do with our twins the other night and made a recipe for Chinese new year from this book. It was delicious and lots of fun to do together. Plus the kids loved doing the activities. Highly reccomended.
2,Kids Around the World Celebrate!: The Best Feasts and Festivals from Many Lands (Kids Around the World),My daughter and I just made date nut cookies from a recipe in this book. They ended up being disasterous and a rather expensive mistake to make. The ingredient proportions and the oven temperature we obviously incorrect.
3,thule 914,nice product a little disapointed on fit into reciever and the fact that you can't use a standard hitch pin or lock
1,Misleading advertising and hostile customer service,"This was my worst online shopping experience that I can remember. The advertisement for the rack was misleading and false when stating ""...The bicycle rack features Thule's Hitch Switch dual quick-release levers for rapid, rear vehicle access..."". But it purposely does not disclose the fact that the rack can only be tilted ""without the bikes on the rack"" making it virtually useless. Upon trying to return this product and requesting shipping charges to be paid by the seller due to the fact that the item is not what was expected the customer service rep and the manager were very hostile and unpleasant. I would never order anything from Autobarn again."
2,"Great product, but...","Great product. However when usually I receive stuff from Amazon, they always arrive in perfect condition. Not this one, it was pretty scratched up and almost looked like used. Since this is heavy and lot of effort to return, decided to keep it."
4,Nice Bike Rack,"Nice Bike Rack. It is a bit heavy and hard to lug around. The screw is a pain but I guess that is why you don't hear noise from it. Heavy to hang on the wall. But have had it a few years and it works well, although the cradles get very hard to twist."
5,Nice rack,"I put this on my Jeep's tow hitch and don't even notice it's there. It clears the spare tire nicely and can easily be pivoted down so I can open the tailgate. I have loaded up 4 bikes on this thing and it holds great. Our family bikes have all different formations but they can be easily manipulated to fit securely. I have no idea why there are more expensive Thule models, this does everything I need it to do."
2,Could have and should have been better.,"No. This is all wrong. Each one of these stories should have been a full novel or a shorter story. Shawshank Redemption is an okay story, albeit dragging at times, but Apt Pupil is the most disgusting story I have ever read...it should be a novel in itself though...too short for what it is..The Body seemed more like Mark Twain than King until the end, but I did like The Breathing Method. Shawshank Redemption was merely okay, with nothing standing out about it. Apt Pupil should have been a novel, to better show everything, with some things omitted...that story was plain disgusting...ugh. The Body should have been a short story, maybe half it's size...too many details that don't matter!!! And last, The Breathing Method should have been a collection of the tales told at the club, not just one story. Overall, good ideas, but bad usage."
4,"Two brilliant stories, two o.k. stories","The first story is Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption, which resulted in the film entitled Shawshank Redemption. This is an excellent short story. Apt Pupil is second in line, and isn't a patch on the previous one. Simply, it is too long. The body is the best, and was made in to a film called Stand By Me. Excellent. The last one is The Breathing Method about a strange club and old men who tell stories. Top notch, but not as good as The Stand Complete & Un-cut Edition, 8.99 at all good book retailers."
5,The Best of King,King has written some really great short stories as well as epic novels (The Stand being the best of that lot). This however stands out as Kings best work.King has gotten his touch back with the last 2 novels but the novellas are his best work. Here's to hoping he has a few more of these hiding under the typewriter for us!
4,What do you know? Even good in Spanish!!!,"I am in a spanish-speaking country currently, and happened to pick this title up at the nearest outraegeously overpriced book store. Too bad I didn't buy from you guys, huh. Anyway, although the edition I bought was in spanish (meaning I did miss out on reading king's own crucial words), I loved it. And I have to admit it lives up to the King reputation; or legacy, if you may."
5,Some of the greatest stories of my adolescence!,"I read this book not knowing that the book included the story, ""The Body"", which growing up was one of my favorite movies, ""Stand By Me"". I had bought it to read ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and was completely taken in by all four of the stories. One of the greatest books i've read in my life. A truly great find."
4,"Apt Pupil was ""OK"", the others were ""da bomb""!","As a reader of most of King's work, I can say that this collection rates in the top 20 percentile of his work. I found Apt Pupil to have some flaws in character motivation, and other flaws. Shawshank might be King's best work, and the Body and Breathing Method were flawless and fast-paced. This is a good book for anyone, even if they don't read King."
4,King at the top of his game when keeping it short & sweet,"Stephen King can scare people with the best of them and few other authors have proven to be as prolific, but this collection of novellas shows that when he chooses to largely dispense with the supernatural and simply tell stories of humanity, he is truly a gifted writer."
4,2 stories caught my eye,i read only 2 of the stories and they both were awesome. i reccomend this book to young adults and old ones. its really good and i would also watch the movie for a full understanding.
5,The King Has Just Entered the Building,"I remember reading this book back in the eighties when I was in college. Then, as now, I was a big, big Stephen King Fan. I had all of his albums and had been to all of his concerts, so to speak. I kept telling my friends that Stephen King was more than a horror writer, and this is the book I used to convince them finally of how correct I was. I am not aware of how this book's sales compare to that of his other works, but the four stories in this collection, including the Breathing Method, are among the best ""stories"" of any genre in the past 25 or so years. I am not surprised that three of the four stories have been made into movies (two of them successfully)."
3,"""The Body""","Reading ""The Body"" makes you feel thoughtful and some incidents are realy ugly . Four boys who live in a problematic situation are between childhood and adulthood and on their journey to find a dead boy they find themselves . If you want to read a novel which connects horror with big feelings like frindship you are right to read this story ."
4,Book,I bought this one for my mom at her request. She got it and enjoyed it. She had read it before and forgot what all stories had been in it. She was pleasantly surprised.
5,Different Seasons by Stephen King,"So far, I've only read the first two novellas in this collection, but they are truly excellent examples of King's storytelling and character development. Even though I have seen the movie version of Shawshank several times, I still enjoyed reading Red's narrative including his inner thoughts. I have not seen the movie, Apt Pupil, but now I want to; shorter books or novellas, especially by King, make excellent movies."
2,Only liked Shawshank Redemption,"The first story was superb, and worthy of an award. The Body was barely decent. The remaining two? Totally depraived, utterly dreadful, and without any of King's charm or wit. The first story could have been published alone-- many novellas have--and there would have been no problem."
2,Inferior Really really long collection of short stories,"I felt that this is one of the lesser King efforts. Everyone likes the Shawshank Redemption but it infuriates me due to the writing flaw of too much coincidence and luck. Frequently King wraps things up too neatly, his characters SUDDENLY know exactly what to do as if a lightbulb goes off or something. These stories are really long, which is not a flaw in itself, but they just aren't interesting or exciting in any way. Its a weak effort at best, and one should read Night Shift or Skeleton Crew instead."
1,NOT A TRADITIONAL STEPHEN KING BOOK,"It is written in a slowly and tedious language, which is not the typical used by S.K.I do not recommend it. I did not even finish it."
1,zzz,"this book was very boring...especially the story ""stand by me"", which was the only one i ever heard of, made me sleepy a lot of times. i even slept more time than it took to read it.i wouldn't buy it!!!"
5,just buy uit,"stephen king is just the master of filling a small space with so much, his short stories always amazing you wont be dissapointed with this book"
3,Kindle Edition Riddled with Typos,"GREAT BOOK! However, the Kindle edition has typos on nearly every page. It doesn't look like anyone took the time to proofread this at all."
5,READ IT IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!!,"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption is THE BEST NOVEL King has ever written.The movie""The Shawshank Redemption"" is great too."
5,That ol' boy from Maine writes pretty good.,"Stephen King knows how to find a story and he knows how to tell it. I began reading ""Shawshank Redemption"" late one evening, and I read and read and read, and read it all that same night. Wow, what a story! I decided the lesson was nonrevenge. You see, Andy Dufresne had every reason to get revenge on the warden, and he could have taken some papers and dropped them in the mail. But that would have split his focus. It would have taken up some short-term memory spaces. And that may have made the difference between escaping and not escaping. So Andy just escaped. He focused on his beach, on the seaside town that he wanted to escape to. And escape he did."
4,"Interesting, hope filled, yet twisted","I bought this for ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" which is the novella that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is based on. That short story was just as good as the movie. Not a fan of King in general though and the other 3 stories were pretty twisted. Not for the faint of heart."
3,My Big Mistake,"Basically, I can just offer you some advice. The best time to read this book is before you have seen any of the movies from which were based upon these stories. My favorite movie of all time is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" so I expected the story to be a million times better. I spent the entire time I read, comparing the two. The story and the movie are nothing alike with the exception of a handful of names. I found that to be true with the other stories as well for the most part. The most enjoyable story in the book (and possibly the most grusome) was ""The Breathing Method."" It starts out slow but ends very strongly. But overall, only read this book with the intention to watch the movies afterwards or not at all. That way it should be more enjoyable."
4,"IF YOU JUST READ ONE STORY, READ 'THE BODY.'","This book was ok, some parts were very boring and tedious. It took me longer than normal to read because it's the type of book you want to leave and say ""ill get back to it later..."" I was glad it was over. AND you have to see the movie 'Stand by Me' based on 'The Body!'"
4,Two really good stories and two O.K. stories,"The first two stories where the best!!!! The next two will keep your interest. All these stories are nothing you would expect from King. I was quite suprised after finishing the book. This book is for all those people who think that King only writes scarey, horror novels! Those people would be really suprised, just like I was."
5,BUY THIS BOOK!!!!,"""The Body"" is one of King's BEST works.(If your not familiar with the story, the movie ""Stand By Me"" was based on it). I loved the movie, but the book is worlds better.Definately a story you never want to end. My favorite story of all time!The rest of the book is OK. I liked ""..Shawshank Redemption"", the rest I could take or leave."
4,One of King's best works,"""Different Seasons"" is a compilation of four King novels. Three (""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", ""Apt Pupil"", and ""The Body"") have been made into films, and it easy to see why. All three are outstanding stories, especially ""Rita Hayworth"" which tells of a wrongly convicted man trying to survive and keep his sanity in a brutal prison. The weakest of the four stories the last one, ""Breathing Method"". Everyone would be well-advised to skip it and only concentrate on the first three tales.For anyone who loves a good story, this collection is a must read."
4,Master Review,"""The Body"" is a novel written by Stephen King which shows the growing up of 4 boys from childhood to adulthood. The 4 boys go on a trip after they heard from a dead body lying in the forest. They think that they become heroes when they find the dead body, but in the end they did not become heroes , they become men.On the trip the characters are confronted with many problems and Stephen King shows us that the 4 boys stay more and more together when they solve a problem. This story is written in a real way and the reader can think themself into the novel because everyone of us grew or will grow up from childhood to adulthood."
1,Temperature Rising,"This is the second Vicks digital thermometer in two years that's failed to deliver.During a recent bout of the flu, it worked three times before giving up the ghost. NOT what you need when someone's sick."
2,Consistently low,"I have several different thermometers have have tested them all against each other and a glass mercury thermometer. This thermometer is consistently between .2 and .5 degrees too cool. Other than that, it's quick and comfortable, it's just wrong."
1,Battery died quickly,"Battery died after less than 5 uses. It takes a CR1225 battery which for whatever reason seems to be the one size of button cell battery NOT commonly found in stores (CVS, Target, Fry's, Walgreens, etc)"
1,Alwaysconsistently wrong,"I love the visual readout of this, really a super design. Too bad that the main function of this thermometer(taking temperatures) was NOT well designed. It always reads very low, but not always the same. It would be one thing if you knew that you always needed to add 2 degrees to be accurate, but sometimes 2 sometimes 3. Not what you want to be worrying about when you have a sick child. Too bad. Buy something else."
1,Useless,Reads consistently low. I was quite sick and the thermometer never read about 97.5. I'm going to find the person who designed it and see if it works rectally.
1,Essentially useless; reads way low,"Either the thermometer reads 2.5 degrees low or our family's normal temperature is 96.1 degrees. I just talked with customer service at the 800 number and the guy basically told me that I could ship it to them for a replacement if they found that it's not working correctly. I told him that this is ludricous; especially for something needed now. He basically said caveat emptor. If you buy, I would take it out and test it right in the store after you buy it and immediately take it back while you are there. We have had digital thermometers that seemed to be accurate within .1 to .3 degrees F; this one is useless if you don't establish some kind of baseline temperature over time for each member of your family."
1,"As with most digital thermometers, this one is junk too","Out of six digital thermometers I have had in my life, four were completely inaccurate right out of the box (by a few degrees!), the fifth one failed completely after three months of intermittent use, and the sixth one's battery died just when I needed it. This Vicks digital thermometer read three degrees too low (which would indicate on the thermometer's display a normal 98.6, when you or your child actually had a temp of 101.6!!). While we may be in the ""Digital Age"" of the 21st century, if you want accuracy and 100% dependability, buy a simple mercury thermometer or, if you are worried about mercury (as I am), purchase a ""Mercury Free Glass Oral Thermometer""."
1,Worse Than Useless - Underreports Temp Significantly (Clinically),"I purchased this one rather than the house brand from the drug store thinking that the national name would ensure some kind of quality. There is no freekin way I can be sitting here with chills and a forehead hot to the touch and have a 97.5 degree temp. I bought this to not have to deal with mercury, you know, the old fashioned kind that ACTUALLY WORKED and didn't need those stupid fussy plastic sleeves that stick to the paper they're mounted on. Sure enough, the mercury reports 101.8. Would love to know how much detail went into the FDA device filing for this unit. Hmmm, a simple call.Never never never buy this."
1,awful. do not buy!,"I don't know if giving a zero is possible, but if it was, that would be too generous. it consistently gives me a reading WAY too low. even when I have a fever, it says my temp is 95. impossible. do not buy this product."
1,junk,"when i bought this item i knew what i wanted.when i finally got the thermometer,i was very disappointed with what i had in my hands! A totally different thermometer that didn't even work and i couldn't find a new battery for it. So in the garbage it went."
2,Grab bag,"A good selection as a guide to the history of science if your interest is on the 19th and 20th century with a strong focus on the philosophy of science.I was very disappointed when I discovered that it lacked an entry for Ptolemy, but included one for Michel Foucault. It's the first book I've ever sent back to amazon."
1,Poor Recording,"I realize these are oldies, but with the advances in technology, I am very surprised at the quality of the recording. Dreadful."
5,A valuable read,I studied this book with a group of educators. The ideas and messages that this book conveys all stem from a positive/strong image of both children and educators. This book offers the opportunity to practice your observation skills. A skill that for those of us who want to know children full well and respond to children with respect and intentionality enjoy practicing and refining on a daily basis. I appreiate the framework of this book as a tool for reflection and connecting our thinking to our values and beliefs about children and childhood.
3,The History of the SS - G.S. Graber (Authur),"The History of the SS is a story following the life of a man named Heinrich Himmler. Heinrich Himmler was to become the greatest mass murderer the world has ever seen. Heinrich was responsible for the production of the Nazi concentration camps. This book followed the life of the SS German officials in the Nazi regime. In the book the reader became aware of all the organizations the SS controled. Heinrich was second in command only to Hitler at the heigth of his career. He was responsible for all the activities the SS oversaw. Since the SS was the major governing body in Germany during the war, it was a very active corporation. The book was very detailed in the descriptions of camps, organizations, and people involved. Through Graber's accounts the reader became more informed on the regime that has become the most evil the world has ever seen."
1,Worst RJ45 Connectors I've Ever Used,"I work in IT and I am sometimes required to terminate Ethernet cable. I bought these, but I am very dissatisfied. They are very cheap. My specific grief are the clips. They are very ""bendy"" and they don't lock the connector into place when you connect them to a port. I am constantly having to reseat/push in the cables I made with these connectors. I only used about 8 of these, but I plan to order some different RJ45 connectors and throw these away."
1,3 of 4 Don't Work,"I am finding that 3 of 4 don't work reliably. I purchased a crimp tool from the same dealer so that should not be the cause. I am finding that the connection may or may not work and nothing is visible to indicate the problem. Plug the connector into the computer and then see if it works. If not then cut it off and try again, and perhaps again. I make them fine with another tool and connectors so it is not user-error. I just have not tried some other connectors with this tool yet to validate the problem with the connectors, but at this point I would not purchase these again."
3,Great Item,Don't buy from PC Small they ship it in a large box 3 pounds was the shipping weight. This resulted in excessive charges on my end. Otherwise the product is great.
2,"AV480 is great, except.....","After I did a firmware upgrade, I have had issues with the 480 not remembering my last settings when I turn it off. I send it in to their customer service, that's where the nightmare begins.I get an email asking for proof of purchase (which UPC code counts for most companies), they require something with date of purchase (real handy for a B-day present) and are not swayed by the logic that it's been out for a year, maybe it falls within the 1 year requirement on the warranty.I ask for a manager to call me back, that never happens.I finally call back after 2 weeks and get a manager, he tells me that it will get sent back immediately.I call back 2.5 weeks later, still hasn't been shipped, no one knows what's going on."
3,"Terrible Customer Service, and I don't even have it yet!","I ordered this awhile ago and it took them 3 days just to send me the UPS tracking information. When I clicked on the link the UPS site had the following error: ""UPS could not locate the shipment details for your request."" So I waited a day to make sure it wasn't a case of the number not being entered into the UPS system. Next day it still didn't work.I emailed Archos Customer Service and I still haven't gotten a response. I want my money back! This is unacceptable service.If you can buy the product in a brick and mortar store, buy it, but avoid the Archos site at all cost for anything other than product information."
1,The AV400 is seriously flawed and ARCHOS service is horrendous,I whole heartedly agree with other bad reviews: my AV400 was seriously flawed - from an engineering standpoint - from the day I bought it and it is still not repaired (and most likely not repairable). Bad battery!!?! The battery has started to expand destroying the whole unit. It doesn't even boot now. For the amount of money I spent I would hope that the unit would last at least a year. It didn't. I would never spend another dime on Archos gear having dealt with their horrendously bad customer and repair service - you can forget about an ARCHOS warranty completely! What use is the warranty if Archos makes it nearly impossible to get something repaired by them?
4,Firmware upgrade,"I have really enjoyed the AV420. I have been able to burn any DVD. I recently upgraded the firmware to 1.8.01. Now I am encountering copy protection issues. Is there a way around this, maybe a MPEG4 ripper?I talked to tech support and they admit to adding the copy protection recognition into newer versions of the firmware. Of course you can't back rev or can you?please help."
1,Should get a ZERO,Don't buy this company's products....They SUCK!!!!!Pick from a more competent company to do business with.Unsuspecting buyers avoid this company at all costs because I have NEVER seenthis level of incompetence with a company. It's the customers that allow themto exist ....but they seem to forget that most important concept.
1,Worst media player ever,"My comment on this product is simply, DON'T buy it. This is the worst piece of electronic I ever bought. They need a way better QC for this product. I have gone through 4 different units and they all fail to read the hard drive after a couple days. If you plan to put two or three files in your 80GB player, it will work fine, but when you start putting more files to the player, it will break. I know someone get a unit that works, but tons of people have problem with this player when I ask the customer service lady about this. Do you really have the time to do the mailing exchange for a few times? If you do, you can think about this product. If not, get something else."
1,Very disappointed,"The AV400 worked fine for me for about a month or so. I saved all my very important files onto it and then, after about 50GBs were used up, it was unable to establish a connection with my computer. I figured it was my computer that was causing the problem so I rebooted it without saving any of my files to CDs or floppy disks. This was a very bad idea because after that I still couldn't establish a connection between my computer and the AV400. I emailed the archos website and told them this exact story and they just told me it needed to sent in for repairs and they couldn't even garuntee that files would be saved. This really made me mad because I spent $700 on this thing and it doesnt even work and I'm going to lose all my files. Does anyone out there know of anyway I could fix this problem and save my files? IF there is please email me at Smojo245@yahoo.com Thank you."
2,Not sure what it does,"Not sure about the effects of this supplement. I have tried different products and some have had noticeable effect (e.g. depressed nerves, yellow urine). Not much to say about this one. Maybe I am not sensitive enough"
4,"nice, but not exactly as described","This is a very pretty, simple napkin holder. It does not, however, match the description. There is no hinge -- the sides are fixed. I was a bit disappointed when I received it, but it's still quite nice."
4,Nice match,"The napkin holder was ordered along with the turntable; arrived on time and wood is a nice match for the turntable. However, the napkin holder arrived broken - didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it so got out the superglue and was able to glue it together so the break is not terribly noticeable. Packing is not good enough to prevent breakage and did note that another person had received 2 of these, both arriving broken. I was disappointed but the glue was adequate to make a strong bond so I have the broken side facing the wall. Gave it 4 stars as it is a nice looking napkin holder (when put back together)."
4,If You Like Hammered Dulcimer...,"You will surely love this album. Classy, tasteful and never boring. It's a shame that so many people are never exposed to music like this."
1,A book that belongs on the back shelves of the library,"I was looking in this book for some answers about the harmful effects of marijuana. But rather found what amounted to outdated propaganda (1970's) from a doctor that never used the drug and never came to any definitive scientific conclusions regarding its so called ""disastrous"" effects.Throughout the book he consistently mentions the weaknesses in the studies he sites that purport weed as being harmful. He also mentions studies such as the large scale Jamaican studies that either report no harmful effects or improved abilities. Yet the good doctor continues to to evangelize weed as being extremely dangerous to our society. Maybe the danger is that if more people smoked there would be less starch shirted, inflexible, egg heads like himself."
1,got full sugar with rum not sugar free,I GOT SUGAR WITH RUM NOT SUGARLESS . I CALLED THEY WERE VERY NICES AND KEEP IT AND WE WILLSEND YOU THE CORRECT ITEMS . SO JAN 2 20O13 NO NEW ITEMSO THATS THAT.
2,Cyclops Bear,"After spending time making the patterns, cutting fur and sewing the pieces together, one of the bear's eyes broke while being hammered to the fastener. Now I have only one eye left!! If the pieces were better made or instructions were better, maybe this wouldn't have happened."
1,Absurd shipping cost,"The floss heads which I have used for some years are excellent but the shipping costs weren't clear to me and it actually made it more expensive than just buying it in a local drugstore. This is another example of small light products being shipped with environmentally damaging excess packaging which, to add insult to injury, unnecessarily increase the product price. We should push for EPA regulations barring this entirely wasteful excess shipping and replace the incompetent company managers who don't make a better and more economical choice."
5,Wonderful read!,"A lovingly crafted novel that combines the best of mystery and romance. Strong plot with ""gotcha!"" twists and characters we care about. I'm ready to fly to Norway to see the places she describes so beautifully.Don't miss the autobiographical note at the end that tells the remarkable journey the author took to get this book to us."
5,Yum!,"It's the only creamer I use .. they have had the large box of French Vanilla for so long, I knew it was just a matter of time before, they came out with this! It's about time!!!"
1,No so good,These are not as good as the Carnation Hazelnut creamer and they are more expensive. I don't think I wl be buying them again.
3,A disappointing beginning,I have just begun to read this book and the first chapter begins with sniping at General Tommy Franks and the Bush administration. I recall a few comments in Franks' book about the Joint Chiefs but I don't recall them setting the tone for the story. It's a disappointing way to begin. Maybe this is the result of a marketing strategy but the people who hate George Bush probably don't buy many military memoirs. It may improve and I may edit this review later but be warned. It begins with a negative tone. Maybe that's why General Zinni liked it. It's not a great way to start.
3,"Meh, good for the price I suppose","The Nylon webbing was a but frayed and clearly had been cleaned up by using a heatgun. It's pretty low quality stuff. The ends are not leather, they are some sort of vinyl coated fabric pleather stuff. They'll hold your guitar up, but I'm not sure for how long. For rocking around the bedroom or other casual use I guess they are fine but if you're gonna actually play live, maybe you should spend a few more bucks."
3,Use only as a monitor,"I'm not a techie, but the audio and video quality is acceptable only if I hook it up my satellite/cable box and use it essentially like a monitor (just like the display model I saw at Target that used cable input). However, totally unsatisfactory when I tried to use it as a stand-alone tv with an external antenna (even a high quality ""amplified"" antenna), especially the ""chirping"" noise noted by another reviewer. Significantly worse audio and video than my old tv with rabbit ears in the exact same location in my house, which I was trying to replace. I like it, but I guess I'll need to buy some coaxial cable, a splitter, and get out my drill."
4,I really like this tv,"I bought this in the states at Target last summer (august 2007). I hooked it up to an external antenna and it works very well. (I live in Toronto and can pick up Toronto and Buffalo stations). In fact, my 40 inch Samsung HDTV doesn't pull in as many channels as this little baby while using the same antenna. I just use it on the back deck. I haven't experienced the chirping problem mentioned by others (and I hope I don't)."
1,Chirping problem like most others,I also have the very annoying chirping sound in the audio on most channels. Unacceptable. I'll be returning this TV today.
1,This book was a waste of my money and time.,Didn't know Hoover was to blame for all the problems of the world...Thank God for people like President Clinton.
4,Not as bad as some people say it is,"I bought this with low expectations after reading several reviews. I wouldn't use this for listening to music as the blackjack seems to output a lot of white noise (that hissing noise you used to hear when you played a tape and there was a silent part).. but that isn't the fault of the headphones. When using it for calls, it works well, and it's not uncomfortable, but they're earbuds afterall and they're just a little bigger than iPod headphones, so maybe some people don't like that. It does what I want it to--make handsfree calls without having to recharge my bluetooth all the time, and without having to look like a huge nerd with a bluetooth thingy in my ear!"
1,too big,"if you have a size of a dunkey's ear, this headset will be perfect for you. the earbuds are so big."
1,Annoying click,"This product, although it's OEM by Samsung, has an annoying click that can be heard between function - whenever it goes from playing a sound to silent."
3,FALLS OUT OF UR EAR...BEWARE,I have some big ears and they fall off everytime u move ur head. Grerat sound quality.Overall OK
4,Good piece,"Overall, I rate this well. I don't like that there are two ear buds because I only use it for the phone, not music. It's not the most comfortable handsfree that I've ever had, but for the price, it's unbeatable. The product works well, I've never had trouble hearing or anyone hearing me. Again, for the price, it's great."
4,Works great !,"I was really skeptical reading the reviews on the handsfree, but decided to give it a shot. The handsfree works great, fits nicely , sound quality is great for both music and calls. No issues so far. FYI.Got the product from CCMAccessories for 9$(incl shipping). Hope this helps"
2,I think they blew it,"Yes, the design is too large for normal ears, and there is no way to get these things comfortable. In addition, there is no volume control on these which is a real disadvantage on my Sync where the only settings are too darn quiet and way too loud. I am still searching for a better solution, but like others have said, Samsung has limited choices by using a proprietary plug. Too bad, because the phone itself is pretty good."
4,Great for the Price,"The price is so cheap you cannot lose. I read the comments before buying this and was worried. I am happy with it. The sound is great. I had a hard time getting the clip to attach to the cord...I finally resorted to a screwdriver to lift open the tab. The left ear piece has a tendency to fall out, it seems to stay in best when I clip the cord close to my neck. I like it, don't feel like an idiot walking around with a bluetooth unit."
1,earbuds way too big,"The earbuds on these headphones are WAY too big. I consider myself an above averaged sized person and I still can't get these things in my ears without total discomfort. I would have returned them, but threw out all the packaging and receipt. They are now in the garbage."
1,Ear Buds,"I have never met anybody that has ear-holes big enough for these! I even tried SuperGlue to put the things that fit inside the ear! That didnt work, so now I have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound & talk sitting in the seat next to me. I would not reccomend these to anybody. Truth Hurts & these Hurt My Ears!"
2,2good2btrue,"if something seems to good to be true it is the price for this prodcut was so great, i should have known better. it did not work and wold have cost more to ship it back"
3,Its ok ..,"I used it for a year .. I did the job .. but I doubt that it is made by Samsung .. Plastic quality is poor, sound it ok .. but as someone said, they don't stay in the ear ..that was the main reason I stopped using it. For the price, its a good deal .."
2,Not Compatible with Samsung Alias 2,This headset will not fit the Samsung Alias 2. I am goning to exchange it for the correct one.
4,Not bad...,"The ear piece worked great and has been since I got it, the only problem was the little clip that clips it to your shirt broke the first time I squeezed it lol. Not a bad buy at all."
2,not satisfied,After having for one week the earpiece does not work. do not recommend to any one for that u buy a bluetooth.
2,"Poor quality, you get what you pay for.","I was very excited when I found this item. Seemed like a great deal. I was even more excited when I first got it... sound was good, didn't have any with the earbuds (unlike many reviewers). My excitement didn't last long, however, because the thing just fell apart after a few hours of use. The flimsy little pieces of plastic do not stay together even with gentle use. At first I was able to get them back together, but it wasn't long before I lost one of the pieces some where. My suggestion: if you're gonna get one, might as well get two or three for spare parts."
3,"Sounds good, but no adjustments!","Originally ordered this set that says it fits for the I-607. I was sent a headset that had a smaller connector that did not fit. Fortunately the seller responded quickly and sent me the correct headset free of charge. Sounds good, but the cord is not adjustable - the left side is much shorter than the right, and it seems like it'll get in the way a lot. For the price, though it does work as expected. I'll probably upgrade to a bluetooth stereo headset soon."
2,"Sound is good, but they keep falling out of my ears!","I don't know about you folks, but I have small ears. Though the sound on these ear buds are good, I can't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they're too big for me, and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears. Unfortunately, this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords. Good idea, badly designed for size differences."
3,Not for a Blackjack 2!,"Even though this will show up in a search for Blackjack 2 accessories this will NOT fit in a i617 Blackjack 2! I accidentally ordered this for my new BJ2 and couldn't use it. Also, Eforcity was the merchant I got mine from and they were most unhelpful in getting me the right item. Their only solution was for me to wait 2 weeks turn around. Unacceptable for a 3 dollar item. Email they sent was also semi rude, short, and blaming. I can say that these things are very big and wouldn't stay in my ears either. Don't know why they made the ear piece so large..."
5,Great Product,I use this product to listen to music and talk on my phone. The sound is amazing and I would recommend it to everyone who has a compatible phone.
5,Works well,Although the i607 (BlackJack) was not listed on the packaging as a compatible device it works perfectly. The earbuds sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a button to answer a call. Even on the call you hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly.
1,Samsung stereo headset for cell phone,"I hate it! It's messy, cords everywhere and the earbuds are very uncomfortable to my ears. Don't use it because I have bluetooth head set."
3,Some Design Issues but still Good Quality,"I only gave this product 3 stars because of the sound quality. There are a number of design issues with this headset:1) The single earpiece you would use to talk on the phone is the very long piece and so the piece you speak into is far far away from where you are speaking.2) You cannot adjust the length of the cords (e.g. if you wanted the speaker piece to be anywhere in the vicinity of your mouth) and so you must tie it similar to what you see in the picture3) The ear piece is HUGE so either you have to wear it uncomfortably shoved in your ear or it will fall out (Side note: I haven't had issues with this with other headsets, so I think it's just this headset)I do like the sound quality and people I'm speaking to comment that it is clear. I also like how the phone can be answered by simply pressing a button on the speaker piece."
1,Too big ear buds,Everyone else was right - the ear buds are too big and are not comfortable. Two thumbs down.
4,Great Sound Quality,I have to say I was quite shocked at the sound quality at such a low cost. I use this Samsung hands free headset more for listening to music than mobile talking but both provide clear crisp quality. The only drawback to this item is the size of the ear buds; they are not as comfortable as I would like because of the size.
1,"Uncomfortable, keeps falling out","This is a poorly designed product. The earbuds don't fit well, and to make things worse have a long rigid piece that is easily bumped."
2,Eh,"Well, perhaps it was my fault for not noticing that the microphone on the headset is a little bulky. It's hangs by the back of my jaw and swings around everywhere. It's no surprise that I've had it for a very short time and it already broke. But, I think I paid a few dollars for it which is worth it, but the shipping is what makes me feel ripped off because the item is so inexpensive which wouldn't bother me normally if I had just bought it at Walmart for about the same price. Maybe $4.99 which would have been cheaper than what I paid for it on Amazon after shipping. So, that's my fault but the item really is a piece of junk. If you buy it, then only expect it to stay in 1 piece for a short time. Maybe that's all you need it for and in which case that would be perfect for you. Otherwise, save your money."
4,FAME FATAL E,"The late Bob Randall has written a compelling story of an overzealous fan and the actress with whom he obsesses, to the point of cold-blooded murder. Told with a series of exchanged letters from different points of view, the plot moves along quite briskly while never loosing focus on characterization and style. The topic, avant-garde at the time, is still as fresh as it was more than twenty-five years ago. Original and narratively impressive, THE FAN should please those seeking suspense with an edge.-----Martin Boucher"
4,Carried by a kook,"_The Fan_ is an epistolary novel chronicling a fan's descent into extreme nutliness and eventually violence, and the effect he has on the object of his affections - Sally Ross, Broadway star - and those around her. The story progresses much as you think it might, and the ending isn't anything unexpected, but where this book really shines is in characterising the obsessed fan. His exquisitely kooky personality comes through in every word he writes, in his casual arrogance, the way he puts some phrases in apostrophes as though they hadn't passed into common use hundreds of years ago.. he'd be perfectly at home on alt.usenet.kooks."
3,"Ok, but another book with no ending",I am beginning to see that most of this authors books do not have a proper ending. He leaves the reader guessing as to what might happen. It's not like he has a sequel coming out that answers all of the questions he leaves the reader with either. On the plus side it wasn't as boring as some of his other books and did keep me interested but I prefer stories with actual endings.
1,Poor planing off the cuff.,"Well what can one say. Don't buy this one. If you have to read it go to the library. (Don't worry it'll be there.) This is the first book I've read by Mr. McDevitt and as you can probably tell I found the book to be a bad read. His charter development was very basic. Once he began developing a charter he killed them off. It almost seemed like he was afraid to take his charters to the next level or lacked the ability to create depth. The story line was predictable the only unknown was which charter was going to live through the adventure. And after dragging the story for 335 pages he concludes with a 2 and 1/2-page epilogue. I've seen other reviews liking Mcdevitt to Niven so I'll give one of his other books a try, yep from the library."
4,Enjoyable Read,"Light fare, fun story, PG rating, enjoyed a couple of characters--Avila and Chaka. I made it to the end of the book which is not always guaranteed with my reading habits. I probably stop reading midway through a novel 50% of the time."
4,Entertaining Book - Interesting Read on the Future,"I finished the book today, and I really liked it. I think the premise is a nice one, clean and easy. I liked the characters very much and I thought they were realisticly done. I also felt that the sci-ence fiction parts really have aged well, the future seemed believeable even by 2007 standards. And that's hard to do. OK, and I liked the ending, it was good, appropriate and wrapped it up. All in all, a good book."
3,"They Found What They Were Looking For, But I Didn't","This was my first Jack McDevitt book.It will not be my last.I truly enjoyed reading this novel. McDevitt's style is smooth and his imagery is vivid. The environment in which he has placed his characters is very well realized. Loved the character of Avila.But ultimately, this book was a grave disappointment. I don't think that I'm spoiling anything to say that the heroes find what they were looking for, but the end of their quest just failed to satisfy me. I don't know if it was my fault for expecting too much, being a sloppy reader, or what, but my building expectations were not met. I suppose I was expecting a major epiphany, a revelation of some import or even an O'Henry twist, but instead was greeted by the same feeling as receiving socks for Christmas...Definitely an author I will try again, but with lowered expectations."
1,"Jack, what happened dude?!","After enjoying McDevitt's well written, exciting, and imaginative ""Deepsix"", I was shocked and dismayed at the ineptitude of this book. It has an interesting premise and starts off ok, but then goes downhill fast. The reader is told, not shown what's happening in this poorly written book, and character development is virtually nonexistent. At one point I was informed that a couple of the characters had ""changed"". Well, I had to take his word for it since they kept going through the motions the same way as before. And two of the characters fell in love even though they had barely spoken or interacted! Also, mundane details kept getting described in detail while important/interesting stuff was completely glossed over! Ugh. I skimmed through to finish but it was a chore, I didn't really care what happened. If you want my advice, avoid."
4,Generally a good read.,"Some clever ideas. Likable characters. Interesting adventure. Problem: it might have been better if it was longer, i.e. it spent more time explaining its people and travels. Generally enjoyable."
2,Abrupt ending; not up to the quality of his previous work,"The problem with the ending of this book isn't that it isn't ""heroic"" or upbeat, but just that it is poorly developed. It's almost like the author was suddenly told he had to wrap everything up in 15 pages, and just dumped off the characters and wrote a quickie ending, without much detail to back it up. The final 'chapter', reads more like an outline than anything else - X goes off to get married, Y set up a shop.. I would rather have waited for a sequel that dealt with the rest of the story more fully than to have the ending that this book has."
3,"good read, some minor problems","This is a great beach read, quick, interesting, thought provoking. There are some problems with believability, not sure how a society that is so backwards still has zippers for instance. And several plot points don't seem to make sense. At one point the characters do away with what might have been an invaluable source of info just because they are asked too. For some reason that really bothered me.But, overall the tale is ingrossing and imaginative. Don't think too much and it is a fun read."
2,"Decent idea, poor story","Eternity Road is a novel set long after the End of the World As We Know it. Civilization is coming back, and wondering at the ruins of what came before. One young woman gathers up an eccentric group of explorers and sets out to find a lost library, guided only by some sketches and a thought-lost copy of A Connecticut Yankee In King Arther's Court.A decent setup. But the book completely fails to live up to its promise. Stilted, flat characters, a world you can't bring yourself to care about, odd little side lectures about society told half from a narrator's perspective, half as if it was a history book, an abrupt ending that changes NOTHING in the world despite the promise of changing everything..Skip it. This book is a poster child for ""Good idea, bad execution""."
3,Failed to Deliver on a Great Concept,"I, like other reviewers, thought that the novel had a terrific beginning but went downhill from that point. McDevitt is not at his best when not in space. This book, though, is very, very similar to the ""Hutch"" series in many ways.Both works contain strong women; both works involve exploration of an unknown area; both involve science and both touch on the meaning of humanity, civilization and the future. The ""eye"" was a good touch but the book seemed to meander while the characters failed to grow. McDevitt is a rationalist whose characters reflect his own philosophical outlook. For this reason, we never have mass murderers or people going berserk and shooting everyone in range. No, his characters have purpose and plans - not totally realistic but certainly better than the nihilism that seems so prevalent in much of the ""literature"" published these days. The ending was particularly weak, especially when compared to the high hopes at the beginning."
3,A Thin Story... Not enough meat...,"I like Jack McDevitt's books. I've read most of the ""Priscilla Hutchinson"" novels (up to Omega) and I have been really impressed. so when I read ""Eternity Road"", I have a certain level of expectations.It was a good story, however it just seemed ""thin"". It kept me interested enough to read more, but it left me wanting to know more about the world of Eternity Road and all the characters I was introduced to."
4,End of the world in a different light.,Although this book started off a little slow (I must admit I almost put it down several times during the first several chapters) it turned out to be an enjoyable read. Jack McDevitt throws a different twist to the end of the world genre. Worth reading!
2,Not a bad little picture,"An agreeable time killer that mixes comedy and suspense, although the latter element is cut off short by an abrupt ending. Nice to see Joan Woodbury (""Brenda Starr"") in a starring role, albeit on Poverty Row (PRC). Print quality and sound are acceptable, but nothing more."
5,British sketch comedy at its best!!,"This is by far the funniest comedy show I have ever seen, surpassing even Monty Python and Rowan Atkinson. I'm so glad it is finally being released on American DVD. Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are not to be missed!"
1,major disappointment,1st part of the 2 dvd set does not play at all in the dvd player or the computer. Major dissappointment.
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed overall with both Seasons one and two. . Perhaps I expected too much, but since you asked for my review I am telling what I thought. Each actor, in my opinion, is capable of a much better, funnier performance."
3,worth the price,"For some reason, the computer is not showing the full memory at start-up. But it seems to improve performance some."
4,"Right Specs, Wrong Card.","All of the specs were correct with this RAM card, but it looked different (it was smaller) than the one in the picture. Also, it was not being recognized by the PC and it was very tight-fitting."
4,British Thriller Actually Understandable to US Reader,"It's not that all British writers write well; it's just that so many of them do. The how's and why's of that are up for discussion. I've often found that UK thriller/procedural writers in particular leave waaaaaaaay too many blank spots, e.g. the actual lives of the characters they parade across the pages. Mark Billingham does not do this. He's created a believable and interesting character in Mr. Thorne. Yes, there are gaps. But that's for the reader to fill in. Reading needn't always be an entirely passive activity. This book is a solid, interesting read. Plenty of ""ah ha"" moments, pathways (both productive and of the dead-end variety) to explore. Basically, Billingham is a subtle writer---but not so much as to be beyond the reader's understanding. Excellent detective fiction with plenty of interesting character sketches."
2,Lazy Bones,Just couldn't get into this book. Nothing to grab or pull you into the story. I prefer a book that doesn't let me put it down.
5,Great mystery thriller,"Billingham's Thorne series is awesome if you're into crime/suspense novels. His writing includes elements of mystery, suspense, humor, and unexpected turns. I may have enjoyed this book more than the first two because the end had so many twists that my heart was actually pounding. Very good series, can't wait to read them all!"
3,Thorne becomes more likable in later books,"In Lazybones and Sleepyhead, both early in this series, Det. Insp. Thorne is simply not a terribly likable character. It's the story and his supporting cast that saves the books. If I hadn't skipped ahead and read the most recent release and seen how the character evolved, I wouldn't be back here reading the cases mentioned in the later book. That said, it was nice to see how the story showed just how not like the silly tv dramas real police work is. It showed how cases can grind along where nothing happens for weeks that leads to the capture of a killer. The climax of the book, while quite brutal, was a good ending that brought together all of the strange bits of information that pop up throughout the book and bring them together."
3,"Good, but could be better","I love the fact that this is a soft thermometer - it is so easy to keep it in place, especially when you could easily fall back to sleep!I do wish that the following things could be either fixed or added:1) The battery cap is right at the end of the thermometer that sticks out, so if it is tight in the holder, you get only the endcap and not the whole thermometer when you go to pull it out.2) I wish that the display was lighted so that I could more easily see the results without having to turn on the light and wake up my sleeping husband.3) I wish that it kept the last temperature taken recorded just in case.Quality is good - Very accurate readings - Comfortable to useJust could be better"
1,Frustrated,"I have used a BD Basal Thermometer, but lost it. So I got the Vicks one to replace it. I am frustrated that it doesn't save the last temperature - so I have to read it in that bleary eyed half sleep each morning with a flash light. I am tempted to buy a new BD thermometer, cause this one is a pain (Toni W. of Taking Charge of your Fertilty fame recommends the BD Thermometer, so I recommend you take her advice)."
3,Not very accurate in my opinion,"I bought this thermometer and the BD basal thermometer and tested them both. I took 3 temperatures with this thermometer and 3 temperatures with the BD thermometer. The BD thermometer had all 97.5's and the Vicks thermometer fluctuated by .2 degrees on all three temps. I tested them again by taking 3 more temps with each thermometer and the BD was still consistent with two temps reading 97.5 and one reading 97.3 and the Vicks was still fluctuating by .2-.5 degrees on all readings. I didn't realize that this thermometer was also a 1/100th reading and the BD thermometer is a 1/10th reading. I read in one of the learning books for NFP that the 1/10th one is the best one to use since you should be recording your temps that way, and since the BD seems more consistant I will just use that one."
1,Don't Bother,"I bought this item needing a laptop cooler. It looked good on paper and the website. I have used it for 4 days with my Gateway MT6451 laptop and have used SpeedFan utility to check internal temps of hard drive and CPU. The cooler has not changed the settings of Speedfan, period. My computer fan still comes on like usual. The problem is the fans in the unit are too small and they should be blowing up not pulling air down. My system pulls air in from the bottom of the laptop and expels it out the side. I need more air coming in at the bottom. The cooler is taking away the air I need. Lesson learned the hard way. I would have given it a 0 star but it was not available."
2,"Fine cups, but typical small cups","I bought these based on the other review stating these were larger cups. They are not. To the brim, they hold 3.5 oz, so they are really standard 3oz cups. They are fine for what they are, but not worth $4 each, as you can get 6 or 8 cups for the same price elsewhere.In other news, they are dishwasher, microwave, and oven safe."
5,Cuter than picture shows!,"This is a very cute, well made little espresso cup. It's edgier and more sophisticated than the picture shows. It is small and not a cappuccino cup. The saucer is thin, however it's indicative of such type of cup, it's small because its espresso, and not grandpa's big coffee cup."
3,A 5 OUNCE CUP,"I just got my set of 4 cups today; so my rating is temporary of 3 stars since you have to give stars. It is incredible how they can put a cup on for sale & not tell you how many ounces it holds! One reviewer warms it is small; another that it is big -- but no one tells you the actual capacity.Filled to the brim it holds almost 5 ounces. Since legally 8 ounces = 1 cup, that means this cup is a tad over half a cup. But it does not look like 1/2 a cup. That is becs many of us are used to a 12 ounce cup, which seems to be the standard. So you won't feel like you have half a cup.I cud not find an 8 ounce ceramic white coffee mug anywhere thus far. Actually I haven't found a plain white ceramic cup under 11 ounces or less. I found one called ""10 ounces"" which turned out to be 12 ounces filled to the brim, a standard coffee mug."
2,expresso cup/saucer,The shape and size are very pleasing to the eye. The handle could be a bit wider as the cups are somewhat heavy and difficult to hold with fingertip when full. For the price they are a good buy. They stack well for storage.
2,should have known better,"Despite the warnings about the cups arriving broken during shipping and that they are too wide, I ordered this product anyway. Big surprise, one cup arrived totally smashed. I was okay with a wider cup, but this is much wider than I thought based on the picture. My coffee will cool far to quickly with these guys. Sending them back ASAP."
4,Very Nice Cups,"Bought these cups to go with my new espresso machine. Good quality construction, don't stain from the coffee. Only broke one saucer so far(which means they are tough), and it glued back together flawlessly. Very good size for extracting a double shot for yourself, or for mixing up an Americano for those who can't handle it straight. Great product."
3,A little bigger than expected,"Picked these up as espresso cups based on reviews. These cups are quite a bit bigger than I had expected. Based on reviews, I was expecting them to be tiny -- like the ones we drank espresso from in Italy... (imagine sipping from a tiny cup with your pinky up!) but they're really big for espresso cups... maybe good for a quadruple shot espresso. As far as quality goes, they seem sturdy, stack neatly, have a deep dish to catch any spillage. Pretty much what you'd expect from a cup and saucer, I suppose."
2,Cute cups broken saucers,"The cups are the right size for espresso and I bought them to use in that capacity. When I opened the box, the top saucer was shattered. I called Amazon and they shipped me out another box and when I opened that box, the top saucer in that one was shattered as well.Needless to say, I have 8 cups and 6 saucers. More cups and saucers then I need, but not enough to make 2 sets.The most disappointing thing was that these were on back order. I ordered them in January and finally got them in March.Amazon obviously has nothing to do with broken saucers, the manufacturer should package them better. A+ for Amazon, C for cups."
1,COOLS WAY TO FAST,SET ARRIVED WITH NO BROKEN PIECES SO THAT WAS NOT A PROBLEM AND FOR THE MONEY ITS NOT A BAD PRODUCT (THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA). THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THEM IS THAT THE ESPRESSO COOLS WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY TO FAST. I ASSUME WITH THE WIDER CUPS MORE HEAT IS BEING LOST IMMEDIATELY. WILL START LOOKING FOR A SET WITH NARROWER AND TALLER STYLE CUPS.
4,Tim Burton meets Lewis Carol,"Wow. This game is incredible. The worlds are facisinating, and the characters the same. Alice's little wonderland from her childhood has been twisted and tortured into a dark land of misery and death. The Queen of Hearts reigns down upon Wonderland with such malice as one would expect in a biography of Hitler. But enough about that. The only problems with the game are 1)It's annoyingly linear 2)The controls are bit tricky to get used to and 3)IT NEEDS A LOT OF HIGH REQUIREMENTS!!"
2,Memory Stick Pro Duo Battle!,"How do the SONY Memory Sticks stack up against the offerings from SanDisk?Depending on what you use your card for, you may not notice a difference. However, the SanDisk cards are clearly faster (almost 3x). The SanDisk cards are also cheaper. See the comparison and decide for yourself: <a href=""http://hardware.gamespot.com/Story-ST-20872-2229-x-x-x"" target=""_blank"">http://hardware.gamespot.com/Story-ST-20872-2229-x-x-x</a>"
1,Beware of counterfeits!!!,"I purchased the M1GN through an Amazon associate and received the expected red and black card in the Sony M1GN packaging. The card looks legit however the rear of the card was stamped MSX-M1GST (their low speed model). Software analysis of the file transfer rate shows 15-20 m/sec consistent with their low speed cards. If you are purchasing this for a digicam or camcorder to get the higher frame rates provided by the high speed version, you won't. I contacted Sony and they are aware these cards are a serious problem. Google ""MSX-M1GN"" and ""fake"" and you will see how huge this problem really is. If the price is too good to be true, it probably isn't true (as I have just discovered)."
1,disappointed,"The book was not in good condition it was acceptable, I was disappointed in the description as it was not accurate."
3,Not quite as described.,"Pages were missing and the overall condition of the book was worse than described. I need it to study, so it's ok, but it certainly shouldn't have been described as ""good"". Shipping was fast."
1,Plush? Look Elsewhere,"I ordered this for my wife because she needed a robe to wear at the spa she's going to in May. I was expecting, due to the description, a real, heavy-duty terry cloth robe. What I got was a wash-cloth thickness material that I was embarrassed to give as a gift. I returned it, and will be looking elsewhere."
5,This book is more true to life than most,"Having read most of the small selection of books relating to EMS.I found this book to be more true to life. In my 16 years experience the last 10 as a Paramedic. I found that I could relate to almost all the stories presented in one way or another. One thing about EMS, We like to tell our stories and listen to others tell there's.These folks did a good job at that."
5,Alot of work went into this one!,"Theisen did her homework--interviewing hundreds of ""angels"". I have a greater respect for paramedics and Emt's now. I'm glad there are people like them in this world!"
5,"A misnomer, but what a book!","I picked up this pounder in hopes of gardening on the cheap, but little did I know what pleasure I would find delving into this well-written account of a fertile time in our nation's history that doesn't get much play in the schools. And, so informative for any one interested in history, and history of the US. Even the garderner in me was gratified: I never knew that hickory needed a split to thrive. What's the sequel?"
3,"More ""Lilo & Stitch"" than A-Teens","Includes three tracks: 1. A-Teens cover of the titled number; 2. ""Hawaiian Roller Coster Ride"" and 3. ""He Mele No Lilo"" with the latter two by the North Shore Children's Choir. If you're looking for remixes of A-Teens ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" you'll be disappointed because there are none (at least on the Australian version of this single)."
3,It is what it is,"I don't think it would be fair to rate this product by modern American standards. It is what it is, an old-fashioned Indian instrument. There are sharp edges that can cut you if you are not careful, a household screw-on hook that holds the chords in place, tacks to hold the unit together (which are not spaced evenly or hammered in flatly), and the reddish paint rubs off onto your hands.It could be a nice decorative item and conversation piece but really has no practical use."
2,Not really detailed enough,This book is ok for general useage but is not detailed enough to go through the bike and trouble shoot ANYTHING on this old a bike
4,Shovelhead Repair Manual,"The Clymer Harley-Davidson Repair Manual is a typical repair manual. Not nearly as much detail or information as a Service Manual but does cover most of the basics. Would like to see more specifics on my particular model, but I suppose sales of manuals covering only one model would not justify the printing costs."
3,I-m sure this is an interesting book to Ark believers!,"This book was written by Rene Noorbergen, not Noor Noorbergen. Rene passed away in 1996 from a heart attack. To my knowledge this book was never released due to a pending lawsuit. It was published by Morrow Publishers, (William Morrow & Co). ISBN 0-68806456-6. Rene had participated in several searches for the ark. I'm sorry that his book was never released."
2,"Pricey Treat for my dog, but he likes it.","The shedding doesn't seem to be any different but my dog does like the treat.I would suggest just using the Furminator brush, no need to buy this unless your dog really likes it.Mike C."
3,FURminator deShedding Dog Treats,"Sounded like a good idea, but my dog doesn't care for them. I do break them up and add them to a meal that she really likes, and therefore, will eventually use them up. I'm not too fond of the smell of them, but could get over that if my dog would eat them as treats. Too soon to tell how effective they are in eliminating or lessening her shedding. She's a labX."
2,Too complicated and violent,"I was really looking forward to this sequel. I read the Seventh Seal and loved it. The Seventh Seal had a great plot and interesting characters. I especially liked Merry, one of the primary characters in The Seventh Seal. Unfortunately, Merry is mentioned only a few times in passing in this book. Too many complicated story lines are riddled with violence, hate, anger, and hopelessness. I'm not one for violence and some of the violence is described quite graphically. To be fair, I must say that the final days will probably be as wicked as they are described here. But I think I prefer not to read about the wickedness in quite so much detail. I cared about only a few of the characters in this book, and persevered to the end reluctantly. I was quite disappointed."
5,A must have for anyone considering or involved in a merger.,"The latest volume from Alex LaJoux is another well-written, comprehensive book from a thought leader in the M&A field. The book not only covers areas of concern and study for companies considering a merger, it also presents information on the post M&A period, a topic that is not covered enough in the currently available materials. Whatever stage of the M&A cycle you are in right now, this is a book you will find useful and insightful."
5,Practical check list for M&A integration,This is an excellent check list for M&A integration with down to earth counsel and how to's. I was impressed with the thorough research and the extensive input from numerous experts with hands on experience in M&A. Post acquisition work is the decisive element in M&A success. This book provides outstanding insight in this critical process. An excellent reference book.
2,The Art of M&A Integration,"Don't waste your time. Purely academic look at M&A integration. Author may have talked to many people, but not enough who've actually been in the trenches doing it."
2,Misleading Title,"The Art of M&A Integration is indeed an Art Book. It might help you in choosing your watercolors, but will not teach you how to paint."
1,Superficial,I found very little useful information in the book because the treatment of the issues is superficial - despite all the footnoted references. At least in one case the information appears to be incorrect - the author states that for a pooling of interests both companies must be publicly-traded (please e-mail me if I am wrong on this issue). I returned the book.
1,Not what I expected...,A very broad list of questions with high level answers. I wouldn't buy this book if I were looking for a deep framework to handle this topic.
4,A great buy!,"Sailor Moon SuperS is the fourth season of the Sailor Moon series. It is also the last season to be dubbed in English. Personally, out of all the seasons, this is my least favorite. In this box set, about 5 out of 7 discs have barely anything to contribute to the plot. Most of the episodes are the same; the Sailors meet a new person, the enemies target that person, the Sailors fight the enemy off and the episode is over. I would say the plot doesn't actually develop until the 6th disc. Many people say this was the last season in English because it was so terrible (which it wasn't), but the real reason is because Cloverway's license over Sailor Moon ended in 2004, which is why the 5th season never got dubbed. I spent about $120 on this box set, and I am very pleased with my purchase. Like I said, not my favorite season but it does have some really awesome episodes! Any Sailor Moon fan should save up their money for this! (:"
5,Old fan approves,"I was a little girl when sailor moon supers aired in Japan but couldn't watch half of this season's sailor moon because my parents decide to move back to the US. While the dubbed voice of sailor moon is annoyingly bad it grows on you. It also helps that Rini/Chib-Usa's voice dubbed is cute. I loved everything about this edition, and squealed with joy knowing they had the original subtitled. I would definitely reccomend this to any fan out there, but if you want to test out what you're getting you can rent from Netflix first like I did. Oh and FYI, there is another season after supers. It hasn't been dubbed yet but it's called sailor moon stars. If its ever dubbed I would just want younger voice actors."
4,One Of My Favorite Seasons,"Great Season, DVD Menu's Were Kinda Lame, Quality Wasn't As Great As It Could've Been, Hate The Dub Version So The Dual Audio Is Great! Geneon/Pioneer Did A Horrible Job Of Dubbing The Voices Are Just Awful, The Only Good Thing They Did Was Keep The Original Japanese Background Music, Besides That Watch The Japanese Subbed Episodes Theyre So Much Better, If Your Used To The English Voices Once You Adapt You'll Love It Soo Much More!"
1,Sailor Moon Super S - The Complete Uncut TV Set,I pay for it and i thought it was the real US one but i receive a bootleg. I try to contact the seller for a refund but one respond i will never buy from this seller.
5,predictable,"its a must have for all sailor moon fans. even though this season isnt their best but it is cute and funny. the episode with mina dating two guys is hilarious.warning: every episodes, in this box set, are very predictable, rini can be and will be a pain, and the last episode is a cliffhanger."
1,Bugs in the herbs,We got the herbs and put them in a closed plastic container. Within days there was a bug farm growing. It was disgusting. Probably the cloth bag allows infiltration.
3,Club Mix 80's,"This is a good 80's cd, there is several 80's songs that are rare,hard to find, and not you probably couldn't find in the store only on Amazon, such as Regina, The Jets, and When in Rome."
2,"Well-written, poor plot","I love John Saul's books, but this one was not worthy of my time. I found the plotline extremely silly. I mean, people turning into insects and running off to the hills? Come on, John Saul, write something along the calibur of Second Child and Hellfire."
1,Horrible,This is the only book that I've ever read that I wanted to burn to get rid of. It was the worst book I've ever read and that includes all the books I had to read in school. I kept hoping that it would get better. It did not. If I could I'd give it negative stars.
3,My least favorite...,"When I first started reading this book, I found that I didn't get into it as quickly as I've gotten into his other books. However, by the time I got to page 100, I found myself speeding through it and getting really interested. I didn't really like the whole bug theme b/c I just can't stand bugs. There were a few pages that I just had to skip over where he talked about spiders - uggh! The last 100 pages were a little hard to get through. The one disappointing thing about this boook is that there was no secret to find out about in the end like most of his other books. It was disappointing to know what was going on the whole time. This is definitely my least favorite John Saul book. I don't recommend reading this if you hate bugs and insects because there is a lot of detail!"
2,Average medical horror,"This is the first Saul book I've read, and up until this point, the only Saul book I've read. While some of the book was entertaining, it certainly wasn't frightening, and honestly, not riveting. I almost gave up on it early on. The serial killer subplot seems to be worth it, but even that becomes ludicrous when we find out more about who we're dealing with.The whole problem with the book comes down to implausibility. If you like Saul, you'll probably get into it."
4,Bee-Zarre!,"John Saul spins a ""queen"" of a tale with this one. I've read plenty of Saul's novels, this is among the best.It seems all of Saul's works include children, secret medical experiments, and the tearing apart of families becuase of it. This one is along those lines, but the experimentation is not necessarily intentional. I'll leave what happens to the reader. It's WICKED GOOD!Although there isn't as much suspense in The Homing as I'm used to out of Saul, there is more horror that I like to see in his writings.If you are a fan of John Saul, check this one out. You won't be disappointed."
3,Better than Average,"I just finished this book - it was my first John Saul book. I can tell from the other reviews this probably isn't his best work. Since I knew nothing of Saul, from the beginning I thought it was a book about a serial killer. Then, it suddenly switched into a horror/sci-fi thriller, which came as a surprise. I enjoyed reading it, but parts of the book were quite redundant, such as the symptoms each victim experienced were virtually the same and yet described in full detail each time. And I wasn't crazy about the ending, either. However, there is more good than bad in this book, and thus the 3 stars."
2,Lacking,"So far I've enjoyed John Saul's books (Second Child, The Unloved) until I read the Homing. I won't say that it was a total bore yet it was lacking. I kept on reading just to see what might happen in the end and oh how disappointing was the end. Just left you hanging. I will keep reading his books cause I love his style but this one will certainly remain on the shelf for a long, long time."
4,Great!!!,"I have begun to read more and more John Saul books, and this one, by far, is the best I've read yet. As I read it, I kept recalling scenes from the recent movie ""The Craft,"" especially the part when insects, maggots, and other creatures mentioned in this book are everywhere. It took me only 3 days to read this. I couldn't put it down. I've found, though, that John Saul books are somewhat repetitive. In the end, the culprit is always caught and punished in some way or another, and a few ""good guys"" usually die before it's all over. I definitely would not recommend this book to those who shudder at the sight of a cockroach. It would make a great movie, though."
2,More children in supernatural danger.,"THE HOMINGby John SaulFawcett Crest, ISBN 0-449-22379-5, $6.99Sometimes coming home is a good thing. Karen Spellman is returning to marry and make a home for herself and her two daughters. Little did she realize that her dreams could turn into a nightmare that she couldn't fight.I used to read John Saul's books when I was younger. I quit when I got tired to reading the same theme over and over -- usually children in danger from ancient evil. Then he brought in tech as a method of endangering them. I am a mother and have nightmares enough about my children's safety.I enjoyed this book -- kinda. I would have enjoyed it more if he could have decided on one plot and stuck with it. Dealing with the serial killer should have been enough -- some of that was chilling. However, I found much concerning the homing silly and hard to suspend disbelief. The ending seemed too much a relief and a let down.--Reviewed by Elspeth Sapphire199"
5,Great read!,"I have never read John Saul's books before, but the title had me wondering what this book was about, so I gave it a go.Classic!!!!Once I started this book, I could not put it down.Creepy, chilling and entertaining to the very end!"
4,Concentrated Goodness,"I'm going to save the 5-star rating for something that really is the cat's meow. This is merely very good so it gets 4 stars.Since the company who sells this says it's more potent than most of the Alpha Lipoics out there, and since I'm a low-dosage kind of guy, I wound up taking one of these per day (in the morning) vs. the two of the synthetic variety (one in the morning, one in the evening, per the ""Packer Plan"" found in ""The Antioxident Miracle""). It has worked out well; there is no difference to my health from taking fewer milligrams, and I feel I'm doing right by taking antioxidents such as this.The price is competitive.I'm re-ordering now and thought I'd take a second to share that simple observation. But as ever, your mileage may vary."
5,The Shield - Season 5,"What a fantastic series! The drama kept me riveted from the first and episodes 8 to 11! Wow!!!!!!!!! I watched it all in the one sitting, couldn't tear myself away. Would you believe that Channel 10 in Australia canned this after three episodes?"
5,Amazing series...thanks to my son who got me hooked.,"A couple of years ago, before my son graduated from college, he made a parody skit of The Shield to present to a committee at school for a job he was up for. He showed it to me and I busted a gut...I had no clue what The Shield was but it got me interested enough to watch. I rented the first couple of seasons from Netflix and downloaded the rest from Amazon Unbox. Loved it.It ruined my T.V. viewing habits though. It is so realistic and the acting is amazing. It is edge of your seat, sad, disgusting and joyful all at the same time. It definitely makes you think about that line that we draw, in terms of right and wrong. Is it necessary to ever step over it in the pursuit of justice?I highly recommend this series. Just watch the first episode of season one and you won't be able to turn back. I promise."
4,Hard core cops on the edge,"I admit I am a Shield junky. I love the show and think it is one of the best on TV. The players on this show get in some crazy situations and get out with their coat smoking. That being said, this was not my favorite season. We loose a key player and Forest Whitiker (the I.A.D cop with a serious jones for taking down the strike team) is not my favorite actor. Maybe it is the ever present spit at the corners of his mouth, or it could be he seems to always be hunched over. I can't put my finger on it, he is really hard to watch in this show. I saw the bonus features in this set and Shawn Ryan thinks this is their best season. I disagree. The strike team is at their best when they are all together and working the streets. I know they are gearing down to end this show, but this season was one that did not quite carry the same punch as the others before it! I still love it and will watch whatever they give us, but I wish they would have left an amazing cast and format alone."
3,sheild season 5,dvd is fine - amazon shipping is an expensive joke - i paid for expediated postage and the item took over 2 weeks to arrive - i suggest buying elswhere or at the local shop!
4,can it get any more intense?!,"FIRST OFF, you can't just watch this season without having watched...nay! i mean OWN your own copies of the other previous seasons. That being said, each season deals with a theme conscience and the destruction that follows after every action to heal it. Im not going to give a synopsis of the show, cause i'd only be remiss. WATCH IT! WATCH THE WHOLE SHOW! Its not that many episodes to catch up! NOW!"
5,A Show That Has Never Let Up,"My two favorite shows of the past ten years have been ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Shield."" As ""The Sopranos"" limps into its final season--let's face it, that show hasn't had the same compelling intensity since its first three incredible seasons--""The Shield"" is still kicking major butt.The quality has never let up and I would highly recommend that you watch every season from the very beginning. The writing is so inventive and the acting is just dynamite.I can't wait to see where they're going with this!"
5,Wow Cacao,"What a great book. Explains all the history and details of cacao. If you want to try some raw organic cacao for yourself check out www.naturalzing.com, Natural Zing.Wow Cacao!"
3,We're fans of DK books,"They're simple. They're informative. They're cheap. If your child is too young to read, they're perfectly good read-aloud books.What more can you ask for when stocking your kid's library?This one is not my favorite, probably because neither niece has shown a real interest in space yet. It's full of facts and well-done pictures, however, it does jump around a little. It might have been written in a more coherent manner.Still, if your kid is very into space, I would recommend this book."
3,major hit for gift,8 year old nephew loved it! but too small for anyone older than that. looks great but quality of construction not worth the price i paid. more like a toy than furniture.
2,Keeps peeling off,"I've had not-up-to-expectation products in the past but never a disappointment like this one. Sure it was affordable, but after only about 10 uses, within 2 months of getting it, the black non stick coating in the scoop started chipping off. I just rub it with my finger and more keeps peeling off. To avoid digestion, I've thrown away the item. It's never been dishwasher as I only use the ""soft"" side of the sponge to hand washes this baby. Just wanted to let folks know what risks they are dealing with in picking this up. I'm going to shop around for a metal one starting today."
3,Seemingly trivial book that tackles important issues,"Admittedly, the main plot of the book, both trite and unrealistic, involves Stephanie Tanner's quest to both usurp the righteousness of the Flamingos and destroy what she believes to be her new rival in the school. However, there is a fantastic subplot involving one of Stephanie's friends pained (for both her and the reader) decision to ultimately terminate an unwanted pregnancy. I found this aspect of the book both powerful and empowering for other young girls who are forced to deal with the stigma that accompanies an abortion."
3,"When I first heard the song ""Tequila""...","...I was a cub scout during the mid-'50s. The Cub Scout Motto, as best as I can recall, went like this; ""The Cub Scout follows akela. The Cub Scout helps the pack go. The Pack helps the Cub Scout grow. The Cub Scout brings good will."" Until I was told otherwise, I thught it was ""Akela!"" that they shout at the end of each verse of the song. Thinking back, it would make an interesting paper--""Alcohol Abuse In Early Scouting"". I get this picture of a bunch of boys standing around in their neckerchiefs and beanies--one of them pulls a bottle of Cuervo out of his backpack and the others go; ""whoah!"""
2,Not Recommended,"I have a shih tzu and bought this groomer clipper kit to keep him shaped between visits to the groomers. Unfortunately, I wasted my money because the clipper will not even cut through his hair. I think I would do better with a mustache trimmer than this clipper. Do yourself a favor and save your money, this clipper isn't strong enough to cut through short hair."
1,Big Disappointment,I've tried 3 times to trim up my 2 pekepoos and the only thing I've accomplished is wearing the dogs and myself out. It's like I'm combing my dogs with a huge comb. I'm so disappointed in the trimmers and have wasted my money!
1,Junk,I bought this last year. It wouldn't cut any hair on my lhasa poo. I had to use my old one instead. What a waste of money.
5,pet groom,"The Oster pet grooming kit was a gift. It was packaged nicely, delivered on time for Christmas. The person who I bought it for likes it. It is a good price. He is pleased with it. Thanx. I'll refer it to someone else if asked."
1,"Oster Home Pet Grooming Kit, 16-Piece Deluxe","These clippers SUCK. I've tried for quite awhile to get them to cut my dogs one inch hair with the shortest guard and all it does is comb the hair. I took the guard/height guide, started with her legs and now they're BALD. I want my money back. Marsha"
5,Ultimate Comfort THERE IS NO EQUAL!,"For everyone of you guys & gals out there, who have never heard of helly hansen, let me welcome you to the brand. It has been around for 100 or so years.Helly Hansen products are superior in quality, design, packaging and innovation. Most of the materials that have been used in their products have a very very good reason for being there. The design of the products has also been tactfully done keeping the comfort in mind. The photograph does no justice to the actual product.Each shoe is individually wrapped in a soft bag with an extra pair of show laces (which are in their own bag) The box itself is also worth mentioning. Opening the box is like unwrapping a gift instead of removing a show. The detail which has been put on the show is also great. Trying on the show brings an immediate smile on your face because of the comfort.Well, if you have never had Helly Hansen products before, welcome and enjoy!"
2,OK,"I just finished Luthiel's Song, and it's an ok story, but it lack fullness.The main character Luthiel is nice, but somewhat bland, the other characters are also on the bland side. Each of the characters seems to sparkle a bit when they are introduced and then fade quickly into the vanilla background. The story has a good pace from one sequence to the next, but at the end I didn't really feel like much happened.The only major flaw I can find is the abundance of made-up words, many of which are too similar to each other, and a few of which serve no purpose and shouldn't have made it to the final draft."
4,great book,"robert fanney came to my school and told us about this book and how it took him nine years to complete it. when he told us that luthiel took her siters place for the vyrl i automatically thought about the hunger games but it turms out that this book is different from what i expected when he read a part of it for us. he says that he is currently working on the third book. so for all those who like fantasy novels with supries around every corner, this book is for you."
3,Luthiel's Song: Dreams of the Ringed Vale,"This is a great tale for young women. It let's them know that they can do anything if they put their mind to it. There are some gruesome parts which I hope will be explained in the next book. There are other parts that were vagely explained which too, I hope will be better explained in the next book.Otherwise, it is great to know that girls rule in this adventure."
2,Tolkien wannabe,"I can appreciate that this book has good pacing, showing not telling, and a female lead. Still, my impression is that Fanney took a pair of scissors to Tolkien, Buffy the Vampire slayer, and a dictionary and then filled in a story around the ensuing collage. Worth 99 cents, yes, but not compelling enough to make me buy the sequel."
3,"OK, I've waited long enough.","I liked the story but there was no ending and I've given up waiting for the next book. It's turning into years not months. To write a cliffhanger with no next book in sight is inexcusable. If I find out the author died or has a terrible sickness or something, I will feel bad for writing this. However there has been no explanation and his webpage and blog is still up but no updates for almost two years that I can find. I would not advise starting this series until the final book is completed, if it ever is. Then I would recommend it and change my rating somewhat."
2,Not the best,"My favorite sentence in the entire book, ""The wights hesitated at first as though considering some silent instruction and then went to work on the wenches."" I'm still laughing!"
4,Something new and interesting,"First off, why 4 stars and not 5? 5 stars is for the very rare and exceptional books. Those are very few and far between. I'll be honest and say...This series is almost there. I started the series and the first book was a little slow to start out, but once I got about 1/2 way into it, I didn't want to put the set down, and finished the last 1/2 and the second book in a day. Very well main character, very interesting plot. I really hope that more comes of this, as well as more development of secondary characters. There's much that can be explored here, and a lot of potential for the series. I'm very glad I found these in the sale section for the Kindle, and I will defiantly watch for more by this author."
4,A good action story with a strong heroine,"I found this a very interesting book.One can read this book by itself, although I must admit I immediately spent the money and read the second book too.Now waiting to read the third, whenever it becomes available.Here we have a very interesting set of premises.And a very strong-willed and brave young woman.Robert has done a very good job of describing a young woman, whom I think is very womanly, but who is also a strong character not just a pretty face."
5,Beautiful and Original,"The first book in Luthiel's Song is an epic fantasy about a young girl with undying devotion to her adopted family - and just about anyone else that she comes across. She is compassionate and wise beyond her years. The landscape that Fannéy creates is equally dark, beautiful, and sometimes terrifying. The lore that Fannéy has created around Oesha is original though he still sticks to the norm of elves, dragons, sorcerors and the like. This is a must read for those who enjoy fantasy books and simply want to read a good story with a well-developed plot and characters. Fannéy leaves the reader in suspense for the next installment. The end of the kindle edition also has extras regarding characters and places from the book. Great buy!"
5,Amazing Book,I just finished reading Dreams of the Ringed Vale....excuse me while i take a minute to catch my breath.....WOW what an amazing tale!!! I love a book tht captures me within a few paragrahs of its begining.....I could not put it down......Luthiel has truely captured my heart!! it is amazing!! How her tale just takes you in and makes you a part of what is goin on in and with her journey....so needless to say i have already ordered The war of the mists.....and CAN NOT WAIT for it to arrive :O) Robert Marston Fannéy is an amazing writer!! His writing style captivates you within seconds of reading ....I anxiously await with great anticipation the future writings of this author!
5,A great book for anyone looking for more inner peace,I have really enjoyed reading this book because it offers wonderful information on many different aspects of relaxation and theraputic concepts. Daily meditation is challenging to adhere to but it is well worth the effort. This book would be very beneficial to anyone looking for natural stress relief or to strengthen your faith or spirituality.
2,"5* debut song, but 2* overall album - a bit sad","When I first heard Reina's debut single ""No One's Gonna Change You"", I was hooked! What a great song, lyrics and totally catchy beat. I listend to that song for a long time and finally decided to get the whole CD. Uh oh...What a disappointment! I still can't believe how weak the material is. I kept listening in disbelief as song after song played. It was hard for me to believe, but true. The rest of the CD isn't even a good party/dance CD to throw on during a get together.Bottom line: Such a sad fate for post-No One's Gonna Change You. If you like that song, buy the CD single because the album isn't even close to the quality of that song."
2,Used Book sold as New BOOK,I did not check the book until I had to read it for class. The first 14 pages were annotated in blue ink.
3,Spice up your Chinese takeout dinner,"This clever little ""box set"" contains just enough to spice up an otherwise dull Chinese takeout dinner. The set contains two placemats printed with the Chinese astrology animals and descriptions, two decorative paper lanterns, two pairs of mini chopsticks, two ceramic chopstick holders, a dozen or so fortune cookie fortunes (minus the cookie), and a small booklet with ideas on how to make the most of your takeout experience. The booklet explains some of the main Chinese dishes, secrets for ordering Chinese food, recipes for making your own ""takeout,"" the art of serving, and a section on teas. Overall, the package might be novel for enough to use for a novel date or two, but don't expect repeated use. While you can save the lanterns and chopstick holders, the remaining items are unlikely to stick around long. And don't count on using the mini chopsticks included in this set. They are for novelty only -- there is no way you can eat with them."
2,DON'T BUY,after the newest windows update the software docent work so you cant use any keysets. customer support takes weeks to get back to you after each response.bottom line: DO NOT BUY
4,"fun and easy to use, but a little difficult to set up","Overall, this keyboard is great. The software is easy to use, and it doesn't take that much effort to become comfortable with the layout. Ideazon also lets you download key setups for several games which is nice.It was a little difficult to install the drivers. Don't waste your time using the cd that comes with it, you'll just end up wasting a couple of restarts uninstalling it and downloading the latest version from [...]. Other than that, it is worth the money. I'd buy it again if I had to do it over."
3,Cool but not necessary,"I bought this hoping to make World of Warcraft easier to play. It does but for the life of me I'm not a macro programmer so there's lots of features that I still don't use like the extra row of buttons to the top edge of the board. And I use print screen regularly and I haven't figured out how to program it into the board.The Technology is cool but a bit delicate so take care switching the keyboards and Z board takes great care in the manual it state this fact. It seems well enough made if you take this precaution.I also bought the WOW board and found that although it moves the quick links into groups and marks them well enough, that really doesn't matter to a person able to use a regular keyboard well.It's a good product just not really my bag."
4,cool but a little flimzy,"nice keyboard, the plastic is a little cheap. Had to rma the main key set the enter key was defective. their tech support was nice and quick.The gaming key sets rock. If your a gamer of even a mild set, get one of these for some frag time."
1,Cost vs. Value,"$40 USD + $20 USD for customized keys just for a game? I thought I would like the product, but then when I saw the price, I jumped out of my skin. I picked it up played with it for a day, and realized that it takes some getting used to. Save your money and simply customize your own regular keyboard - because this is just the same thing, but it just has a graphic yet takes up RAM and is a bit awkward."
1,Not received,"I never received this item from Amazon/Ritz Camera. I had to send 2 emails to even get an answer from Ritz, which was that it was not in stock. This happened 1 week before Christmas, and it was the top of my Grandson's wish list. Fortunately, I was able to find it elsewhere on line, and paid a fortune to have it delivered by Christmas. My Grandson loves it.Recently, Ritz Camera called me to offer me a $15 gift certificate for my trouble, I told them thanks, but no thanks. Then they tried to persuade me to remove my reviews of them from Amazon's website. Not happening, what I said was true."
4,Birthday Gift,I ordered this board for my husband who is to say AVID gamer would be an understatment...he is in love. Great choice for a power gamer.
4,very cool,"I really like this keyboard. I have rather large hands, and the larger buttons have made a big improvement in my gaming. Also the quality was better than I expected for the price"
1,Piece of garbage.,"Great idea. Lousy implementation.I had high hopes for this keyboard. When I received the keyboard, I took note of it's cheap, ""plasticky"" construction. It's built like one of those old G.I. Joe vehicle toys.""W"" key became sticky after 1 week of use. Cleaning didn't help. After 2 weeks, the keyboard stopped functioning completely. I don't believe power is even getting to the board.The only satisfaction I derived from this keyboard was destroying it with my bare, furious hands. That felt damn good.Complete waste of $40.00.Beware!"
1,Ideazon Zboard Gaming Keyboard not working,"I bought this product, the keyboard, along with a keyset to play Warhammer online. When I got the Keyboard, the key set was not available, was out of stock. So I had to wait 2-3 weeks to get the keyset. Now everytime I turn my computer on, I get a Windows message saying that ZEngine has stopped working. And my keyset does not work. The keyboard just works as a regular keyboard. Ideazon sent me 2 possible solutions to my problem, but none of them worked. They say they are working on a fix, that should be ready in a week. No news yet. I'm very dissapointed."
4,PERFECT GAMING KEYBOARD,"My soon to be 17-year-old son purchased this keyboard and awarded it * * * * FOUR STARS. The ONLY drawback was INSTALLATION and it's a dust trap. Otherwise, it's the perfect gaming keyboard and he's happy."
2,Great but Hard to get use to,"The Z-Board is great. But If you are playing Battlefield 2 and then switch to the ZBoard you are in a fix. The controls are totally different and very hard to get use to. If you start with it, it might be alright but I think the regular keyboard will be just fine."
4,great keyboard,The z-board is an awesome product which makes playing the games we play easier. The only problem I have is that since I installed the keyboard my headset/microphone is not working properly with ventrillo. I think there is a driverr conflict.
1,good idea...,"it's just junk, the thing had potential but it was done terribly, as for hardware it's alright, but it isn't any better than a regular keyboard, AT ALL. the thing that makes it junk is the software, i used if for a few months because i didn't want to waste my money, but i just gave up, whenever i changed keysets it would freeze and i would have to reboot or unplug the usb, i tried using their costomer support but it was worthless, i then tried to download the newest version of the software, while installing it it just froze, then i couldn't use my mouse, so i couldn't do anything, the fact that the keyboard software messed up my mouse is pathetic, i had to manually turn off my computer and do a safe start to be able to finnaly remove the horrible software.save your money, this keyboard is worthless, i'm using a $10 dollar keyboard that i got at wallmart right now, and it is way better"
4,Good Idea Bad Setup for the Real gamer,I love the Idea of the Zboard BUT for someone who Has Played alot of competative games I would sugjest the Merc Stealth as I now have or the Z MERC witch My friends all have now that they have used mine. There are a few issues with them still but the best ones I have found Yet for Gamming
1,Absolute Garbage,"There are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. I fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.It would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install Windows..Overall a very shoddy product. If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard. It's what I'm writing this review on right now, and I've owned it for more than a year, a long time after I've thrown away the worthless Zboard as well."
1,Lots of issues,Unfortunately I had nothing but bad luck with these... The first one I bought had 5 malfunctioning keys and the second on was not working as intended either.I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,My Review ZBOARD,I purchased this ZBOARD 4 to 5 years ago and it was a great keyboard. I had the standard and the gaming keyboards and you could select around 10 games to interface with. Whenever this ZBOARD Company was sold is when it didn't work or software updates any longer. As a matter of fact my hard drive crashed and I had to replace it but I couldn't find my original software disc. I tried down loading the online SW and it didn't work at all It continues to ask for disk one which i dont have. Now this is useless and will not work any longer. They sure screwed this up by not supporting the KB once the company was taken over. I doubt if I will purchase anything from the new company Steelseries???????
3,Didnt fit,The regular key board didn't fit onto the board. It wouldn't snap down making it so some letters didn't work. The gaming how ever was just fine. It matches up the keys differently so its a change from a normal key board. Never got used much.
1,slick but doesn't last,"My boyfriend and I each bought one of these with the Burning Crusade Keyset a few months ago. At first we were very impressed with it and it functioned beautifully. This lasted aboout three months, then mine began to be scrambled, both with the BC keyset and with the normal keyset. I have tried reseting, reinstalling the drivers, and everythiing else I could think of--nothing worked. The same thing happened to my boyfriend's board two weeks later. Have had no help from the manufacturer.In short we had two of these die 3 months after purchase. Not good."
5,Wicked!!!,"The ZBoard is the next best thing to having a voice activated keyboard that writes for you. Its great for anything you want to do. If your a gamer, get this keyboard, it has changeable keypads for all the best new games and it helps a lot! If your new or experienced this is a great keyboard. And the best part is, it works for typing as well. The ZBoard has a layout specifically . designed for typing AND searching on the web so it's good for everyone not just hardcore gamers. I love this keyboard."
2,I would not recommend this product.,"The key board constantly freezed up and then it shuts itself down, causing my son to stop what he is doing to correct the problem. The packaging makes it look very exciting, but it still has not been perfected. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Disappointed,"My son REALLY REALLY wanted this gaming keyboard and was very excited when it arrived.... However, the one thing they do not mention in their notes is that this keyboard is NOT compatible with all gaming systems.... Customer support for this product was slow as well, (need to send an email and wait for a reply), too long! I can say the product looked nice and arrived promptly and safely, but we never got to use it! Actually it's all backed up and ready to go back!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"I cannot overstate how disappointed I was with this keyboard. I purchased the USB version, and immediately ran into problems. No matter how many times I updated the driver and reinstalled the software, the keyboard simply refused to work.Ideazon's tech support is simply abysmal. This is a company that DOES NOT list their phone number anywhere on their website or within their literature. They do not want to talk to you. All their tech support is done via e-mail, which is inherently slow, inefficient, and ultimately pointless.To sum up, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I am packing it up in the box it came in and shipping it back to Amazon tomorrow. What a let-down!"
3,"Passable plot, action, & dialogue","Strumpet-in-distress Luise runs across burly ex-con Brazil while attempting to escape the evil clutches of rich abusive boyfriend. Rich boyfriend resents losing girl to burly ex-con. Trouble for the new couple ensues. Serious trust issues abound.Known for epicurean plot cooking, Hammett keeps 'Woman In The Dark' strictly meat-and-potatoes.He subtitled this 76 page 'long' story ""A Dangerous Romance"". Truth be told, this is about as romantic as Hammett's stuff ever got---rough embraces, lips pressed hard and tightly together. You get the idea...except there doesn't seem to be enough of that to qualify the tale as a romance.Dialogue is pretty faithful Dashiellese, although the 'OGJI'--- the Obsolete Gangster Jargon Index --is as low as I've seen. Less than 1.0 per page.Regardless of my notions of romance and gangster palaver, this is a fast and satisfying read by one of the best writers of the genre. But then, any Hammett is better than none."
3,"Just a Sketch, Nothing More","Freya Stark, the unlikely traveler, takes us on a casual journal, an anecdote, nothing more. But it preserves an Afghanistan otherwise condemned by its own history. A knot in the tapestry of too many empires, victim of its own past projected onto the present, Afghanistan, except for sketches like these, has vanished, and only remains in the personal stories of isolated members of its populace, who for better or worse have managed to survive."
5,serious workout,"This workout will not waste your time. I have only just begun using it, but I can tell it is going to yield the results I am looking for. It is challenging and yet flexible at the same time. The different workout options allow me to do some level of exercise daily. Teddi combines moves so that you're working more than one part of your body at a time (holding in your abs, working on balance, etc.), which makes the most of your precious time. Repeating the moves throughout the circuit at different speeds or intensity challenges your muscles in new ways. She focuses on areas of your body that have been stressed (and stretched) by pregnancy, while also working on muscles that get taxed from picking up children, holding them, changing diapers, etc. That being said, it would be a great workout for any woman at any stage in her life (even if you've never been pregnant). I highly recommend this DVD."
5,Great for all women,"You can get your pre-pregnancy body back and this will help. I've been training with Teddi every week for over two years now and this DVD is as effective as having Teddi training you in your own home. All women, no matter what stage in life can benefit from this DVD."
