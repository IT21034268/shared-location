2,Buy It At A News Stand,The magazine is actually quite good and I picked it up for my mom for a few years. The problem came when I finally subscribed. They haven't sent one issue! Repeated correspondence with the magazine has gone unanswered.Buyer BEWARE!
5,A top pick for any serious exercise DVD collection.,"This low impact cardio workout by a Hollywood stunt woman comes from a woman in her late 60s who stunt doubles for stars young enough to be her children, so the insights are particularly revealing. Stretches and kicks blend aerobics, yoga and ballet and a bonus segment includes clips of several of her stunts. Her regimens are fun and easy to duplicate for all ages and fitness levels, making STUNTBLASTERS WORKOUT a top pick for any serious exercise DVD collection."
3,good and a half,"It is hard to believe the band Peter Green formed came out with Rumors and took over the world--even if by than Fleetwood Mac had a whole newe crew.After a lot of blues and a lot of acid, Green came out with this free form guitar album--him swooping and swirling over great backing tracks.And for a 1960s experiment, this is great--a lot better than the description may lead you to think. My only issue is that the guitar is so far mixed back, Green's excellent improvisations are obscured.Perhaps that is the freak out point. But a different mix would have made this a better album"
3,Average is the new Good,"Criticising a Peter Green album is a bit like kicking a puppy, but here goes.This record would have been best suited as part of a box set, or as extra CD to accompany one of his studio albums.There's no denying the quality of the musicianship, but it's just a series of jam sessions, very good jam sessions, but they still have only has a limited appeal.But saying that, even a half-decent Peter Green record is still an interesting listen.Sorry Peter."
2,May be Peter's Weakest Album,"This is Peter Green's first solo album. It was recorded and released a few months after he left Fleetwood Mac. The album is instrumental. Unfortunately, if your expecting ""Albatross"" or ""Slabo Day"" you will be much disappointed. This may be Peter's weakest album."
3,Not as good OR as bad as they say.,"This is what often is labelled ""a spirited oddity."" Peter Green, having left Fleetwood Mac after ""The Green Manalishi"" single, spends a weekend doing an alternately inspired, alternately tired series of jams with several close acquaintances from other British bands of the time. The best analogy I could make is to Miles Davis' BITCHES BREW, except that that album had a certain energy to it, or seemed to at any rate, while this one seems to keep throwing things out to the listener in the hope that something will stick. It's not a bad album by any stretch, just a little more meandering and diffuse than might be desired."
2,A Sad Foray into Mental Illness,"Which fortunately, Peter Green has overcome now. I hung on every note of the album then play on ( which i later found out a lot of which was danny kirwan).i LOVED the live Boston Tea Party, ANYTHING with Peter Green on it. Then i found the casstte for ""End of the Game""...for 10 years I have tried to justify this album, listening to it in cycles and different mind frames, and I keep hearing a futile effort by a twisted genius to fulfill a record contract with an album of meandering noise...very few places do i hear the ""tone"" i crave. I'm sorry that it is this way,but a LOT of us got lost in the fog in the 70s, myself included. and so did my favorite guitarist of all time, Peter Green. I imagine he would agree with this review himself."
2,Squalid structure,"Despite pockets of Hendrix-esque technique, Green's first solo release was so lazy composition-wise even classic jam fans may be shaking their heads in arhythmical disappointment."
4,Not For The Faint Of Heart Or The Noninitiated,"Reviews of this album are, to say the least, all over the map. If in fact you're expecting Over My Head or Rhinannon or even Black Magic Woman, then you've come to the wrong place. End game marked Peter Green's first solo effort and came out sometime around Then Play On, his last studio recording with FM. That said, this is primarily free-form jazz guitar improvisation, along the lines of Hendrix meets Mahavishnu John McLaughlin. Warning!!!!Not for the faint of heart or the noninitiated."
2,Great performances but still a rip-off !,"I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like ""Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967"".It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!"
4,enjoyable album-one reservation,"I really did enjoy this album -my first Boz Scaggs purchase but for the track""But Beautiful""I would have rated it 5 stars.The excessive drum beat on this number really ruined this beautiful song.The remaining tracks were breathtaking - wonderful sound."
3,Boz,I have always liked Boz Scaggs so I wanted to add to my collection. This is not one of my favorites though. All the songs seem to drag a bit. I wish he would have had a few more up-tempo oldies stuck in the mix. But I am glad to have it as part of my collection.
2,"Nooo, sorry. Strangely empty of emotion, uninvolving.","I picked this up because a) it's Boz Scaggs, a guy whose records I wore out when they first hit, and b) it's full of great old songs. BUT: Boz sounds like he's doing something else, maybe surfing the internet or looking out the window, when he sings. Hard to imagine that the man who punched out ""Lido"" can sound so half-asleep performing great material. A washed-out, almost depressing performance. There are many much better renditions of these classic songs. I imagine it's hard to come up with new material, but please, if you're going to do these songs at least sing as if you're awake. No emotion, no involvement. And to add annoyance to injury, Boz somehow found the world's worst drummer for this session. If you can tap your fork on a tabletop you can play the cymbals and traps as well as him, incessantly dopey and grindingly repetitive. Pass on this one."
3,"""Handydandy"" doesn't get it.","Tom B ""handydandy"" missed the point entirely when he wrote his review in 2003. Listen to ""I Should Care"", the man is sad and he is probably looking out the window as he sings thinking of what was, could have been, but alas, wasn't meant to be. By the way Boz is not one of my favorites and I must commend him for this track at least."
1,Crass Saxaphone,"l live in Australia and eagerly awaited this C.D. Have been a fan for many years and have always felt Boz to be one of the pioneers of Smooth Jazz.The intimacy and subtlety of Boz's voice is overshadowed by the terrible saxaphone playing (shrill tone and obnoxious solos)The C.D is superb otherwise, but unfortunately l consider it unlistenable as is. It would have worked better as a trio or perhaps with some orchestral support.Boz's own ""Harbour Lights"" and ""Night of Van Gogh"" is indicative of the true potential this project could have had.Five stars for effort - Zero for result!!"
2,"Wrong voice, right attitude","I love Boz, but I don't think he has the right voice (tone/timbre) to pull off these classics. I just saw him in Aspen, CO, and that only confirmed my feelings. He's got the band, the phrasing and the attitude, but he just can't pull it off with his voice. He has a distinctive spot in the blues/rock genre and should stick with it!"
2,Uninspired,"I am a Boz Scggs fan from 1971. I am also a jazz fan with deep appreciation for the old standars. It seems that more and more, everyone, from the new jazz crooners and divas, to the vintage rockers are covering the standards. I have found many of their interpetations interesting and intertaining. I am not a big Phil Collins fan, but his cover of ""Do Nothin' till you hear from me"" on Q's ook Joint (Quincy Jones) is a prime example. I anticipated that Boz Scaggs, with his voice and past productions would be the ultimate to cover the old standards. Disappointingly, I found his interpetations uninspired and totally lacking soul. It was an unexpected disappointment of a fan who has almost all his releases back to the days od vinyl."
3,Pretty Good,"while I don't usually like Modern Day Standards takes because Rod Stewart's try at it last year stunk this one is actually pretty good.Boz Scaggs does a pretty good job at doing certain standards&maintaing his vibe.I like how He does ""What's New"".i dig Boz Scagg's laid-Back Personna on Record."
2,LIFELESS AND UNINSPIRING,"Countless pop stars have tackled ""Standards"" in the past twenty years: Linda Ronstadt; Rod Stewart; Leon Russell; Crystal Gayle; the list goes on. Unfortunately, Boz does so with such little enthusiasm that this set is ultimately lifeless and tedious. Boz has a great voice and I had hoped he would have been more emotional in his delivery of these great songs. But his ""lounge"" accompaniment is too redundant, and all the songs sort of sound the same. Nice try, but Boz is better with his own material.NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Item shipped not the same as pictured.,"Although the computer mount is made by safco, the top mounting plate is not the same as pictured. I purchased this specifically because of the design of the mounting plate. unfortunately that is not what was sent. on the plus side, the shipping was really quick. I have added a photo of the plate shipped."
1,this didn't work on any of the platforms,I purchased this because I work with Three and Four Year olds and they have the Dr. Suess one. They Loved to play the Demo of this one one the other so I got this for them . It will not work on any computer I have put it on and I have tried like ten no computer will even acknowledge it so needless to say I am disappointed and so are 12 three and four years olds
1,Where is the Game,I bought this CD for my four year old and after putting the CD into the drive. I only got music. This disk looks as if someone tried to do a bootleg copy. I am very upset because I paid almost $8.00 for this and my baby was waiting to play the game. How disappointing.
3,Good Reference - Not a How-to,"I gave this review 3 stars, because this book is really not what it claims to me - a guide for caregiving. What it *is* is an excellent reference that describes cerebral palsy fully, the medical implications, and treatment options. I does not go into detail about caregiving - things I would be looking for with this title are safe bathing techniques, how to administer meds, safe feeding techniques, transporting, etc. I think it's a decent reference - although you can probably find most of this info on the web these days. But if you are looking for specific caregiving information, this is not it."
2,"I Love This Album, But.....","...somehow Sundazed screwed up the remastering. Several tracks sound overmodulated. It's the same sound you get when you overload a digital recorder, and I suspect that's what happened somewhere along the line when this CD was made. It is a loud CD. It's frustrating because it's obvious that Sundazed used the session tapes. If not for the added distortion, this would be a great sounding CD from start to finish. If this had happened to one of the Beatles CDs, the problem would have been corrected by now. But since it's ""only"" a Raiders album, I guess we just have to put up with this sloppiness. By the way, Sundazed did do a ""fix"" on their ""Revolution"" CD, which had the same problem. The noise was very obvious on that release, so I guess Sundazed felt they had to redo it. As for the other PRR CD they released in '96, ""Something Happening"", it has the same problem and apparently no fix has been done. Luckily, some cuts on ""Happening"" are totally free of the noise."
5,Thank you Hermie!,The Hermie series consistently offers light hearted fun and a solid message. Webster is one of the funniest characters they have created. The voices and script are top notch and it's wonderful entertainment for the entire family. My kids keep asking to pray like Hermie does to God. That's the real testament to the video. That it impacts the children more when it's off then when it's on. Keep cranking out quality!
4,Webster the Scaredy Spider,"In Max Lucado's ""Hermie and Friends"" series, bugs deliver a message to kids. They enjoy the story and parents know they can trust the publisher. The series is popular at this library!"
1,"low price, low quality","the microphone is poorly made, buttons are difficult to push, recording quality is poor, software was entertaining for about 10 minutes but it's inflexibility rendered it useless. Even if you get it for free, as I did, it is not worth the hassle. Mine sits in a drawer, unused for many months, after only about 30 minutes of use."
2,wierd little gadget,"I got this device at a Goodwill for a buck. I had no idea what it even was, but thought it looked cool. I knew it must be some sort of voice recorder, but its kinda hard to work with, and the quality is rather poor, reminiscent of the old YakBaks in the late 90s. I got on and was surprised at the price on Amazon, but reading the reviews, it doesn't sound like a too great of a piece of equipment. But, for a $1, its kinda cool looking, and makes a heck of an alien communicator prop for an Indy film, which is really the reason I got it in the first place!"
3,READ THIS,I BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON AND I JUST WANT U TO KNOW THAT IT IS GOOD BUT IT IS WORTHLESS IT SO DIFFICULT TO WORK AND EVERYTHING ELSE
5,Incredibly helpful,"I read this book four years ago, before my divorce. I credit the book with giving me a fairly level head throughout the entire separation/divorce process. The focus on how you and your ex will be joined at the hip for the rest of your lives for birthdays, graduations, weddings, etc. coupled with the authors' pragmatic advice made me realize what a long haul it was - I had to just get over all the emotional baggage and look forward to a life as a different kind of family, but a family nonetheless.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is having trouble in his/her marriage. My ex-husband was also willing to read it, which helped a lot. I really think this book helped me and my ex-husband figure out how to co-parent in a friendly, non-threatening way."
5,Excellent guide,Excellent guide for parents. The book gives a series of practical advice. It is honest and realistic.
5,Thoughtful short work,"more of a compendium of short interviews than indepth analysis but once again provides some thought provoking ideas for anyone interested in the world around them and if your're not, WHY NOT?"
4,short interesting books on foreign policy and trade,"The chomsky trilogy consists or three books from chomsky. They cover issues that really brought out by the media. They focus on U.S. foreign policy that many people may not be aware of it like nicauraga and hati. He deals with how coporations and strong anti-communist feeling influenced the policy. In addition, the books cover trade agreements like NAFTA and GATT and how they are influenced by corporations and turning parts of the industrialized world into the third world."
2,One of the craziest mixes of music you'll ever hear on 1 CD,"Chaco is not horrible. It's just one of those CD's that I only listen to a few tracks, once in a while. I find them funny, not because I understand their lyrics (I speak very little Spanish and the whole CD is in Spanish), but because of the emotions they put into their music. It's definitely one of those crazy music mixes, using sounds from the decades of the 70's to the 90's, to the soft sounds of R&B, and to the ruffer sounds of hard rock and disc jock. If you've got a few bucks to blow, and you like to amuse friends with sorta stupid music, then it's worth the doe."
1,Aún peor,"Como completista de todo aquello en lo que participa Robert Fripp, compré hace algunos meses el disco ""4 5 6"" de The Grid. El disco me pareció francamente malo. Este lo adquirí por el mismo motivo...y es aún peor. En algúna ocasión he leido que se pueden encontrar influencias de Tangerine Dream, Pink Floyd, etc. Por favor.....¿dónde?."
4,A Regency Romance set in war time Spain,"Dawn Lindsey's book is a little different from the normal Regency, as it is set in Spain as the French occupy and later the British drive them out. The heroine Regina Alderstock's father died leaving her mother to wed a Spaniard. By the time the story is told her mother has died as well but she remains in her step father's household. Her step-brother is leading one of the guerrilla bands. Major Adam Canfield puts himself at risk to save a child, Regina has his injured body brought back to her step father's house. There are some interesting descriptions of camp life and the hardships of war."
1,killed my inspiration to sew,"I was not making anything crazy - mostly straight stitches for a doggie bed cover and an apron. The second day of use, the automatic threader didn't function right anymore. The bobbin gets jammed a lot. Perfect for muslin, but if you are planning on using anything thicker than that then it will just drive you bonkers. Got it last friday, packed it last night and will be returning it today."
1,Wouldn't ever recommend,I have only sewed on my machine a couple of times and it has already gone to the shop! Service guy worked on it for three hours and told me to come get it! Can't be fixed!!! The bobbin casing was defective and several other problems. I feel like I just threw my money away. Won't buy Singer again!
3,great book,"This book was great! it made you feel like your own child was going to be givin away. Jeannette Eyerly did a great job on describing the charecters, it was like you knew them."
5,Real McKenzies Pissed Tae Th' Gills: A Drunken Live Tribute to Robbie Burns,"Great DVD! If you are a fan of the Real Mckenzies...you must buy this DVD! They cover many of their hits in this live show including ""My Bonnie"", ""Scots Wha' Ha'e"". If you don't know the Real McKenzies and think you might like crazy Scottish music that really rocks...check it out!There is also a great music video of the song ""Mainland"" included as a bonus."
3,Still have squirrels,"Not many birds....squirrels spend a lot of time on it but can't get to the ""food"" as easily as other feeders. In my opinion, it's still not ""squirrel proof""!!!!"
4,Purchased for a gift,The gift receiver has thanked me twice for the book. He has enjoyed it very much.
4,"A special look at American history and culture, through the eyes of the people","This book was pretty good. It did at times seemed a bit vague and I felt there could have been more to it. It was very interesting and a great way to see how people put their emotions on paper to our presidents throughout history. It really shows how people were feeling in times of great struggle and great triumph and how by writing a letter to the president, they were taking part in their nation and trying to make an impact. It was an amazing way to look at some of the National Archives treasures."
3,Unchanging plot made my feelings of this book drop.,"I have to admit that during the period of reading My Name Is Asher Lev, I was interested, and I continued to turn the page. Maybe that was only because it was an assignment for summer reading. Anyhow, the unchangable plot made this assignment more of a burden to continue. From reading the first part of the book, you can get an idea on how the whole book will go on. I did learn values of different cultures from this book, namely, the Hasidic Jews, but I was disapointed to find out at the end of the book that nothing was accomplished to better the relationships between Asher and his parents. There are many out there who would like reading this book, but for me, it is one that I wouldn't have picked out for myself in the first place."
5,"wonderful,lyrical and sweet","Mr. name is asher lev tells the story of a young Chasidic Jew in Brooklyn who is beginning his lifelong oodyssey of artitic longing and adventure. His parents being good pious people are at times mystified and eventually mortified at the result of his art. Mr. Potok is perhaps my favorite novvelist because he writes ,so well, about things that matter:God,life, children and parents,art fun and love.In this book{which though it stands by itself, should be read with its sequal, THE GIFT OF ASHER LEV},Mr. Potok gets will ionto the creative mind. Asher Lev is faced with the torturous decision of art or conscience{well, family}. His decision and the conclusion remind one of Marc Chagalls white crucifixion. Superb writing,excellent story."
4,Chasidic? - Loyal to what?,"This is the story of a Chasid whose only true loyalty is to his art. Everytime he has a choice to make whether it is between his art and his family or between his art and his G_d, he chooses his art. Asher Lev makes an idol, not of the images that he paints but of his talent for painting them. The book gives a rare and rich look into the world of Chasidism and is worth reading for this alone. As a Christian, I would recommend it to any non-Jew who wants to understand more about Judaism. It is a great work of literature but it smacks of Jewish Reconstructionist tendencies. To paraphrase one of Potok's characters in another work of his, ""I don't like his answers."" ""Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the L_RD. For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water."" Jeremiah 2:12,13 (KJV)"
5,Wonderful thought provoking book,"I can only say amen to all the wonderful reviews of this book which I have been meaning to read for years but there was always some new best seller that got in the way. This is truly great writing. Asher Lev's struggle with so much internal conflict is heart rendering but not depressing. The ending of the book left me with so much conflicted emotion.Although to many this might be considered a ""Jewish story"" - it is so much more than that. Cultural differences, family love, artistic talent, doubt, faith, tradition, and church codes of belief are all explored. This truly is a classic."
1,"Wooden, cold, stilted","This story is about a little Jewish boy, Asher Lev, who is from a severely conservative Hasidic family and neighborhood in New York.At a very early age, he becomes obsessed with drawing and he is exceptionally good. Long story short - he's an artistic prodigy, which disturbs his parents to no end because they believe art to be anti-Jewish and a sin.Asher said the world was not pretty and he wouldn't paint it pretty and, boy, he didn't. I think the moral of the story is that sometimes, when you choose your own path, it hurts people.My biggest complaint about this book is that the boy was so wooden and unlikable. He talked in monosyllables, if he talked at all. His personality was cold and stilted and his mother's personality was just as unrealistic and empty.I do not understand why people loved this book."
1,Save Yourself,"Here is my recommendation. DON'T read this book. No, it's not horrible and I didn't cringe when I read it. But neither did I walk away a changed man. The character of Asher is so cold, static, and most importantly immature. The choice Asher makes in the end is in my own opinion the right one of course (especially since religion was the alternative and i hate religion, another factor that added to the insipidity of this book). Yet after being exposed to Asher's thoughts throughout the book, I'm not convinced his ultimate decision was righteous.I'm tempted to just say, ""read the book so you can see what I mean!!!1"" but alas, no. You will make the right decision and you will not read this book. Potok's writing is fluid and borderline enjoyable but this does not save the novel from a 1-star rating. Again, the concept behind the book was alright but the deliver, in terms of plot structure and character development, was very unsatisfying for me.My Name Is Asher Lev: A big 1 out of 5 stars."
1,explanation of this book,"yes, i read this book; and it was very gary! yes, i mean gary!!gary meaning gay.. this had no relavance to society, i am an artist, maybe not as big as pottock, but hey! i would say, that in a way its only good how it refelcts jews, but im a jew, and my parents were not like that, nor was the family arond me or my friends...please e mail me at Rico2030405@aol.com..."
5,I can't stop thinking about it.,"I feel so close to Asher Lev that I feel upset that I will never meet him. I will never see his paintings, never see his parents or Yudel Krinsky. Potok has a way of allowing the reader to have such an intimate knowledge and understanding of his characters -- I know why people have cried when they've read his work. I also really liked getting to feel like I was learning a lot about Judaism while I was reading it. I even had a dream that I met a Jewish family and I asked them if I could possibly hear their Krias Shema. I can only imagine what it might sound like, and I imagine it's beautiful."
3,Definitely Not His Best,"As expected, Asher Lev was definitely a well-written book. However, in comparison to Chaim Potok's The Chosen, the book was mundanely slow-paced, repetitive and wasn't gripping. The story line didn't move at all for the first half of the book! I found myself falling asleep at times due to the gloomy and depressing atmosphere of the book.The book is enriching, but certainly NOT entertaining. It doesn't come out and grab the reader by any means; I wouldn't recommend this book to somebody looking to read outside of the classroom. Again, if you read or have read the Chosen, you will see how good of a novel Potok creates when he combines sophisticated writing, with a captivating storyline."
4,My Name is Asher Lev,"When a little boy watches his mother struggle through mental illness, it can't help but have an impact on him, which ofcourse it did with Asher Lev.Asher is an artist and draws his emotions - unfortunate for his parents, since they don't want to see his emotions, nor do they want anyone else to see them - yet it is what keeps Asher alive.""No one says you have to paint pain and ultimate anguish and torment. But if you are driven to paint it, you have no other way.""Chaim Potok is a gifted writer."
3,A Cultural Classic,this novel is a classic. the words are beautiful and well chosen. great story that takes its time to develop. gives insight into ladover hasidic jewish culture. a powerful ending. a very good read
4,Art vs. Religion,"Loved this book despite the slow start. Very deep, intellectual, and thoughtful. I'd recommend anybody looking to delve deep into the art world (visual, musical, or literary) read this book.My favorite quotes:""You should make the world pretty, Asher,"" my mother whispered, leaning toward me. I could smell her breath. ""I don't like the world, Mama. It's not pretty. I won't draw it pretty.""""Then help me with the brushes,"" he said. ""A Jew should not only talk, he should also do.""Sometimes I think the Master of the Universe has another world to take care of, and He neglects this world, God forbid.To touch a person's heart, you must see a person's face. One cannot reach a soul through a telephone.""""So life would be precious, Asher. Something that is yours forever is never precious.""I stared at my reflection in the train window. Come, journey with me through the centuries, my eyes said. One learns to walk decades."
3,Good for kids,A really cute and creative story. It's a quick read with good morals and each chapter could be used to teach a lesson to children.
5,"Manual for life, and savoir vivre","My best friend once told me, about a person without manners: ""S/he doesn't know how to restrain her/himself - we need some repression for civilization to work!"" My take on that is a bit less psychoanalytic and more philosophical. I believe that beauty comes from the tension between discipline and creativity. This book from Emily/Peggy Post allows us to live in this state of grace, or savoir vivre: automatizing some little rules of consideration, in order to be more and more spontaneous with our fellow neighbor and dearest beings. Thank you for writing that. This book is helping me to be a better person and should serve me in becoming a better mother."
2,Kindle version NOT easy to reference,"The book itself is very good, as others have said. But the Kindle version is very awkward to use. The Table of Contents is too broad, so you can't go directly to the particular situation you're interested in. There is an index of sorts, called 'Searchable Term's, beginning at location 16438, but it's not set up with hyperlinks."
4,A Must Have Reference for Any Family,"Wish I had this when I was a young man.Impress your boss, friends and family."
2,Disappointing,"I have an older copy of Emily Post's Etiquette that I think is much better written than this version. Yes, I do admire the idea of updating the book to recognize changes since the 1980s, such as the rise in the use of email and cellphones. Nonetheless, I think the book raises these issues without giving much in the way of practical etiquette advice. Want to know something surprising? Letitia Baldrige's new etiquette book does a much better job on this front. Frankly, I'll probably donate the new Post book to clear space on my crowded bookcases."
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this CD and listened to it on the drive home - I thought my ears were playing tricks on me! I couldn't make out the vocals. They were mixed very low, and were murky. Well you know, sometimes you need headphones. But at home I tried headphones, in vain.The only songs with audible vocals were Family Affair and Running Away.Wish I would have ""ran away"" from the music store that day."
4,Feverish climax,"An easy to read, fast-paced, page turner setting the stage for two women with inquisitive minds yearning to know; ultimately satisfying a Gone with the Wind attitude with a feverish climax."
5,A & P made EZ,"This book is really a great book. It really explains difficult concepts clearly and concisely. I have never taken A&P before, but after reading this, it probably won't be so hard. Some of the pictures are taken from Grant's (I have this book too and it's really good)and are very clear. I would highly recommend reading this book if you are going in to the medical field. It's so interesting and easy to understand."
4,Simple and Sturdy wine rack,"Oenophilia 60 bottle wine rack is simple, elegant,Oenophilia Alexander 60-Bottle Cellar Wine Racksturdy and takes a minimal amount of space. Anchoring to the wall with at least two screws is all it needs. Only problem is that the design does not accomodate the occasional long bottle, which is not at the optimal angle because its shoulder rests on the front wire support."
3,It's ok,"I do like it... for what it is. it really isn't very sturdy and there are improvements that could be made to make it better. But for the cost of it and the need I had, it works."
4,"Attractive, useful, strong (we have purchased 2 for our garage)","It looks quite nice when up and will hold splits as well as full size bottles of wine, and 5 cases of full size bottles.It took 2 people to mount on the wall since the rack itself is awkward to hold and position against the wall while putting the screws in.I recommend that you use an electric drill. Also have a stud finder, yardstick, level, and painter's tape, and a pencil available to facilitate positioning the rack on the wall.We're quite happy with our purchase, and are in the process of purchasing 2 more of the same rack.I took away one star, because no directions for wall-mounting are included. Be sure to save the box, because only the picture on the outside provides a clue about positioning the cross braces and there are no directions about how to screw things together, nor how to mount the rack on the wall."
3,Works Fine But Expensive for What It Is,"The Oenophilia Alexander wine rack works fine, but is rather expensive for what it is. The rack is very simple and looks like it should cost no more than $15 if it were for a purpose other than holding wine. It is very flimsy if not attached to the wall, so it must be secured as it is designed to do in order to hold bottles safely. But once secured it is nice and compact and can hold a lot of wine. I would give it 5-stars if it were only priced appropriately."
3,Just okay,"I got this wine rack for my BF as a x-mas present. Let's be honest here, it is ugly (1 star deducted for that) but I was having it installed in an unused closet so that really didn't matter to me. The rack is functional as advertised and mounts to the wall easily (especially when you have the guy who is replacing your kitchen backsplash do it for you, lol). However I believe that the rack I received was assembled backwards. The downward slant towards the cork end of the bottle faces the wall. My guy was able to put some shims between the mount and the wall to make it work so it really wasnt a big deal but I did deduct 1 full star for this issue. I will say that I think leaving the rack free standing is a very bad idea because it doesn't weight much and I think it might tip over when half full. Other than the backwards thing, the rack is as advertised and as long as you don't need it to be pretty, it is a good deal for the price. I would rate it as a buy but keep your expectations low."
1,Waste of money,This rack is completely useless...it has a cheap build and feel to it and no stability to it. I just wasted my money on it and can't use it.
5,Great value wine rack,"This is a great wine rack for the price. While perhaps not as nice looking as the wooden ones, the price per bottle is drastically cheaper. Basically no assembly required unless you mount it to a wall, it's sturdy and looks fine. Mine is in our cellar so not really on display, and holds a lot of wine for the footprint. All bottles fit, including my thickest Burgundy style bottles, except for on the edge slots, where they're too fat. Rhone style bottles, however, fit there fine. I'll probably be buying another one soon, I got my first as an open box return for only $60, even if the second is full price, I'll have 120 bottle storage for a little more then $1/bottle. I'm very happy with that kind of value."
4,wine racks,These racks fit the bill. I put them in a storage area and was able to attach them to the studs to make them secure. Good deal and right price.
5,Oenophilia Alexander 60-Bottle Cellar Wine Rack,"Nice wine rack for a closet or cellar, nothing fancy, pure utility value. Once attached to a wall, it is sturdy and stable. I did not try magnum bottles, but standard wine bottles fit without any problems."
5,Wine rack,This is just what I was looking for. A substantial rack that could be secured to a wall for a reasonable price.
5,GREAT RACK!,Great little basic metal rack that fits well into any space. The rack is pretty sturdy whether as a stand alone or attached to a wall. I am liking it pretty much.
5,Perfect quick wine storage,"This 60 bottle wine rack is perfect for quick storage even without fixation to the wall if it is slightly balanced against the wall using the bottles. It is stable and there is no set up and makes bottle storage simple. I'm using it in the basement against concrete and worried that I couldn't screw it into the wall, but that is not needed for stability."
5,Stable and serves its purpose,"I ordered this wine rack to hold the wine we recently purchased in wine country. This was quite an investment so I wanted to make sure this was sturdy in our unfinished basement. We set up very quickly and is quite stable without attaching it to the wall. I feel comfortable this will not tip over. I'm pleased with this purchase and should I need another, not hesitate to buy it again."
5,Great deal for a good price,"Everyone's reviews are pretty spot on. This is not a standalone wine rack but really sturdy when you anchor it to the wall with the anchors and screws provided. It fit the bill perfectly for me in the end of one of our closets. I would suggest mounting it off the floor on a sturdy platform otherwise you are down on the floor looking for wine on the bottom shelves. About 16"" off the floor worked great and gave me room to store a few bottles or a box of wine underneath. I built a simple shelf out of 1/2"" plywood and 2x4 legs - I was not concerned about appearance since in a closet. I used washers under the screws before I mounted the rack to the wall. As noted, the rows are a little close together but this does not seem to be a big deal. I priced plain-Jane pine, unfinished wooden racks and they were $40 or more higher for the same amount of bottles."
4,Good Wine Rack. Bad Shipping packaging. Weak wall mount,Sturdy. Easy to assemble. Solid and holds 60 bottles without bending. Wall mounting hardware provided was very undersized for the weight of 60 bottles. Packaging was HORRIBLE- cheap Chinese cardboard that arrived ripped and punctured in multiple locations. Rack somehow managed not to have any damage.
4,Must Read Book for Nice Guys who want to change!!,"I saw this book at a used bookstore last week and I bought it on a whim. I'm glad I picked it up.As one who is a recovering CNG, reading this book has become the cure to our disease.Jesus wasn't nice, He was good. He was assertive when he needed to be and gentle when he needed to be.Coughlin writes how the church has skewed it into the extreme that following Jesus means you have to be nice.So untrue!!Mr. Coughlin, thank you for writing this book. I hope the words of this book will cure other CNG's from the disease of niceness.Bravo!!!"
4,Difficult read,"This was pretty much on the mark. To fully understand I will need to read it again and break it down. Before reading you should understand that Jesus used humor and sarcasm, felt pain and got angry in his short time here among us. This book really needs the reader to understand this and to learn to act as Jesus did instead of just being a 'Nice Guy."
4,Good Review,"I had to purchase this book when I saw the line: ""Jesus the Bearded Woman"". This book challenges the contemporary view that Jesus was a push-over and therefore all Christians should be push-overs as well. It had some original thoughts. Although it isn't in my top collection. I am glad I purchased it."
5,Book Review,Excellent book on how a Christian man should behave in relationships with other people in the church and with the world.
1,Don't buy it!,"I think I would have to say, that this was one of the worst books I have attempted to read. It was hard to keep track of the characters because they were hard to warm up to. They were just names on paper. I could not finish it. I had to put it down, which for me, I have never done before. I usually love this type of novel, but while reading this, I just wanted someone to shoot me and put me out of my misery."
1,Took forever to get working,"My 4 yr. old son received this as a birthday gift. My husband (who is a computer director) took several hours to get it working, we tried it both on a PC and a Mac. It is very sluggish and doesn't seem to be working correctly."
1,unstimulating for any child over 3 years,"This was purchased for a 5 year old, but has proved to be very boring for him. Though there are various scene and vehicle changes available, it is the same old thing over and over. Even at the highest skill level, the treasure hunt is anticlimactic. My 2 year old is enjoying it however, but at any price, this is not worth it."
5,Easy Installation,"My 4 year old installed this all by himself on our pc. At first I was angry he tried to do it by himself, but because it was soooo simple that even a 4 year old can do it I thought it was kinda funny. Extremely plug and play friendly. And he loves the game too."
3,"A good start, a promising future...","It's good to know there is another good latin pop/rock star beside Julieta Venegas. This is the Spanish version of ""On Nights Like This."" The Colombian singer (by way of New Jersey) does very well with light pop, and puebecito viejo is a tribute to her heritage. All in all, a good start."
5,achingly beautiful from start to finish!!!,"...it's a pity that Soraya is often overlooked in today's music scene full of platinum blonde latina divas...here's a true musician..she's not just a beautiful face (although she's got that too)...she is refreshingly latina in her style...she plays instruments, writes her lyrics which reflect a deeper soul...the music is moody and beautiful at times...the opening track is catchy and draws you in...but the rest of the tracks are the real meat, with exquisite chords played beside her enchanting voice which invokes strokes of passion and confession...the last track : pueblito viejo is simply exquisite!!! It invokes the a small latino town with romantic lush orchestrations behind a song of aching simplicity....Soraya has poured out her heart here..some of the songs are catchy but it is with repeated listenings that the beauties of the other songs come out..."
5,A tribute to Soraya's mother. . .,"The CD was released shortly after Soraya's mother died after a long struggle with breast cancer. The title song ""En Esta Noche"" and its English version ""On Nights Like This"" were written by Soraya in tribute to her mother. I thought the song was about a romance between a man and a woman. After I learned that it was about Soraya's love for her mother, her mother's long battle with cancer, and the night her mother died, the lyrics made more sense to me. It brought tears to my eyes."
2,Disappointing,"I really enjoyed Ron White's Drunk In Public. This, however, is a release of an older routine from 1990. Thankfully, he has gotten better with time. The older material is funny but the sense of timing and delivery is just not there. I will purchase any new releases of Ron White's, but I would not recommend this one."
2,Not really necessary to go with the CD,"I didn't find this book all to useful or helpful. It tells you to do specific activities that coincide with the paperback book ""Preparing for Adolescence"", but it also suggests use with the CD. Then the workbook breaks down each activity to a coinciding page section of the paperback book. In other words if you have the CD you won't know which lessons apply to what. Also, it didn't seem to match up really with what the CD's were discussing. I suppose if used in a group setting this book would be more helpful, but for me and my parent/homeschool use it simply wasn't worth it. I wish I hadn't of spent the extra money. The corresponding CD was fantastic."
5,"A True ""Crown Jewel""","Brilliant combination of humor, wit, and sentiment. At first you may be put off by ""Maggie's"" forceful nature. But once you understand her goal of liberating ""Will,"" and recognize her affection is genuine, you really admire her. She is a tremendous example of what strength of character can accomplish, even with the humblest beginning. An intelligent film full of great performances! Can't wait to see it on DVD--soon, please!!!!"
1,Laughton at His Finest,"It is amazing to me how obscure a title Hobson's Choice is. Charles Laughton is again Captain Bly, but he is outdone by his eldest daughter who successfully stages a mutiny against Laughton's no marriage edict. When she marries Laughton's Casper Milktoast bootmaker and gives him the courage to open his own shop, Laughton faces ruin from the competition and is forced to endure and succumb to his mutinous daughter and her husband. The film is absolutely hilarious, and unlike most British comedies which are either excruciatingly dry, or founded upon lascivious humor. All of the characters are extremely believable and overwhelminly endearing. The movie boasts an absolutely superb script, great acting and great entertainment.Whatever can be done to get this movie restored and released on DVD should be done. Who do we write to AFI? Criterion? Where do we get the addresses?"
5,Timex Bodylink T5C391 (with Data Recorder II),"Just received this item (bought on EBAY). Simply incredible value for the cost (I paid around $200 for watch, GPS, HRM, GPS, and data recorder).I considered Suunto, Polar, Garmin, and this Timex. Can't speak about the others but I am SO glad I chose this one. I am a military officer who trains pretty hard (running, ruck march, hiking, biking) and can't believe how much better training is with this device. Pace count and predictive finish take all the guess work out of training. Upload the data to the computer when I'm done and I can see precise routing, pace, elevation, speed, heart rate...at any point or time along my run. Looking forward to putting it on the motorcycle so I can go home after and overlay the exact ride route on a map and see where the heck I just rode."
2,Styrofoam bowling pins and ball,I ordered this item with the hopes of great fun for a school fall festival. The bowling idea was a great hit.Unfortunatley the styrofoam bowling pins DID NOT hold up to this kind of heavy play. The necks of the pins all began to break half way through the festival. It is my feeling for the high price I paid for this fun game The Styrofoam Bowling Game was not worth the money.
3,Drive-By Scholarship,"""the answer lies in providing states with internal organizational structure and, above all, with a culture that enables strong leaders and government institutions to enforce capitalist and free-market values. Since he sees the ""international community"" represented by the United Nations as a myth because it lacks a military, the mantle of leadership must be worn by the U.S., at great risk to itself.""Frankly I haven't read the book, but after reading this comment in the editorial review I'm not adding it to my list. It suggests the author understands neither institutions or cultures. There are serious scholars who have studied these issues for years. Fukuyama seems to claim expertise based on a narrow sampling of the literature.Let's offer Fukuyama a chance to prove his theory by sending him off to, say, Nigeria. We'll look forward to a postive report in, say, about 2 generations?"
4,One of the best karaoke CDs I've heard!,"Last year I was in the play, ""Oliver!"", and they used this CD instead of an orchestra. I bought a copy of this CD to practice with at home, and I was suprised at the quality. While most karaoke CDs sound like they were done with an electronic keyboard, this one sounds like an orchestra is playing along to your singing. It's an excellent CD, and really fun to sing along to. It's much better than you'd expect.However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of one problem: the CD is a little quiet. You have to turn the volume up to it's highest setting to hear it really good. It's not too much of a problem though.I rate this CD 4 1/2 stars because of it's unexpectedly good quality, exceptionally fun music, and extrordinary beautiful orchestra.My favorite tracks are: ""It's a Fine Life"", ""Oom-Pah-Pah"", ""Who Will Buy"", and ""Pick a Pocket or Two""."
4,Good album,"I remember seeing the video for ""More Than I Wanted to Know"" in late 1996 on CMT. I was a fan right then and there. This was their only album. I think one of the girls died a few years ago. It's a shame country radio never picked up on this duo. They have great harmonies. There are nice ballads like ""She'll Let That Telephone Ring"", ""Asking For The Moon"", and fun uptempo's like ""More Than I wanted To Know"", ""Right Plan Wrong Man"", ""Border Town Road"" and more. Definately a talented duo that made a great cd!"
1,Rip-off at ANY price,"I bought this for my 6-year old son, and it was a complete waste of money. One of those Hallmark greeting cards that records your voice is a MUCH better value. This thing records about 30 seconds of sound (4-bit very bad mono quality). Even the 30-seconds of recorded sound is a joke, as it frequently self-corrupted (just clicked) -- so good luck!Save your money!"
2,Hoax,You get what you pay for! The product is cheaply made and performs just as well (which is very poor). [....]
1,Don't get this,Its the worst worst worst thing you can get as a microphone or voice recorder. better off just give me the money instead and I'll give you a rock. you might have more use and fun with it. DON'T buy! its been 5 months and my rebate never came!
1,One of the great rip offs of our time.,"I bought this when there was a rebate making the effective price $0.Of course I never got the rebate, but even if I had, I would have paid too much. It sounds bad, the software locks up your PC, and it stopped working after 1 day. There is no reason for anyone to ever buy this product, unless you want to give it to someone you want to know how much you hate."
5,More than pleased,"I have long been a fan of the McGuffey Readers,and so this little book compiling selections fromthe most popular edition of the Reader in 1879is a treasure worthy of its name."
3,A little overrated,"I bought this book based upon its glowing reviews. I was a little disappointed. This book is fine for the beginning options investor, but I was looking for something more advanced. The author tries to present the information in the form of a story, but he is clearly no story writer. The story uses up a lot of space in a misguided effort to amuse and entertain. If I want amusement I will buy non-fiction. Also, this particular story is incredibly condescending to females, whom the author presents as decorative fluff entirely incapable of understanding something as mysterious and highly technical as stock options. I kept looking at the inside cover, thinking maybe this was a book that was written decades ago -- it reads like something out of the 1950's.I did like the author's method of picking stocks for covered calls, although this entire informaton could be presented in less than one chapter."
1,See Spot Run,"This book is in simple story form page after page after page. Pump high living and how to get rich now. Follow me and subscribe to my software. Nothing you can not get free on the web or make up in a spread sheet/data base yourself. If it was not for the long winded ""see Spot run"" story of friends talking to friends about the money tree the book would be readable in 20 minutes. All this is my opion of course but read a few pages. It is a rip off as far as I am concerned."
1,A child's book on options,This book was horrible. Spoke more about the Rotary club than option strategies. Don't waste your money like I did. If you have never heard of an option before ....you might learn something. This book was an advertisement for their software.chuck
3,annoying writing,The writing style detracts form the otherwise good explanation of what options are and the recommended techniques.
1,Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!,"This has to be the worst movie that I have ever seen. It has a terrible plot and mainly has to deal with a boring love story. The acting is really bad. The only semi-good part was when the older sister finds a dead bird and says "" wow a dead bird"" and then turns around and says "" wow a dead body"". This movie was a mistake to have made and I can see why the director Rick Rosenthal disowned it. In my opinion every copy of it should be burned."
1,Don't Bother...common sense stuff,This book is a waste of time. It tells you nothing that a basic business book couldn't. It is all common sense: Be nice to people... Duh! Call people and...OK? To pay [money]is unreal for a book that could have been written by a high school kid. This tells me that anyone with enough effort can be published.
4,Enjoyable historical adventure mystery,"Captain Cut-Throat is an enjoyable historical whodunit/adventure which has all the elements one expects from the novels of John Dickson Carr (aka Carter Dickson): fast-paced narrative, delicious humour, playful sexyness and, of course, locked-room mysteries. Nevertheless, it is not among the most typical of Carr's works, as it is one of his few historical adventures (of which the best is probably The Devil in Velvet, set in the Victorian England and featuring early Scotland Yard). Swordplay and general swashbuckling and romancing actually seem take more importance than solving the murder puzzles. While Napoleon's armies are getting ready to cross Channel and invade England, a ghost-like murderer begins to stalk soldiers and guards of the invasion army. A young British spy is blackmailed by the French secret service to uncover the murderer."
2,Pure hysterics..... so what if there is no gold.,"So what if there is no gold in Knox? The U.S. has been off the gold standard for decades. This film is so sensationalistic and overblown with weird soundtrack and 3 people who are described as simply attorney, professor and engineer. How lame. Just pure yellow journalism, film to make a buck... and not an ounce of gold to see either."
3,good messages...not so great voice,"I like the messages and the calming music on this CD. The guided meditations are helpful when dealing with any kind of infertility, however, the woman's voice is not very soothing. It almost sounds raspy and is very monotone."
1,it has not been arrived yet!!,"it's been a couple of month since i ordered, and i already paid. but sitll it has not been arrived yet."
1,Talks too fast,I did not like this CD becasue it made me nervous instead of calming me down. I would rather forget I am having infertility troubles than be reminded of it on a CD. She talks way too fast also. It wasn't a relaxing CD for me.
3,Too Sweet,"Just the milk chocolate version was a little too sweet for the adult guests. The second time around I mixed it with the dark chocolate, and it turned out great. The bags are extremely easy to use -- just melt in the microwave and pour into the fountain."
4,Perfect for fountain chocolate.,"Throw the bag in the microwave, turn on the fountain, pour the melted chocolate from the bag into the fountain, ????, profit.The chocolate tastes great, you don't have to cut it up/mix it with oil/anything else.Don't try to heat it in the fountain alone, unless you have lots of time on your hands. In my experience, once you bust out the fountain, people drool in anticipation and making them wait half an hour + for the fountain alone to melt the chocolate causes unhappy guests. It works much better heating in the microwave for a little bit to get it melted and then dumping it into the fountain; maybe a 5 minute ordeal TOPS.Texture: smooth, not waxy at all.Sweetness: high, they added plenty of sugar to the cocoa."
5,This fountain chocalate is amazing!,"This chocolate is so smooth and creamy, perfect for a fountain. I always get rave reviews when I use this product."
1,Continuing Education Units No Longer Available,"After buying all four of these books with the intention of completing the CEU's for recertification of my ICBLE, I read the previous reviewer's comments. I called Jones and Bartlett Publishers (1-800-832-0034) who verified this information. CEU's are NOT available. The set of four books were not cheap. I am greatly disappointed."
3,NOT THE CHIPS YOU THINK THEY ARE,"While these chips are good, they are not the ones I was looking for and thought I was ordering. Don't let the picture fool you. These are NOT the Wheat Thins Chips Veggie that you get out of vending machines. The picutre DOES NOT match what you will receive. You get the Garden Valley Veggie chips that you can easily find in any grocery store. Those chips are good too - but they are not as good as the veggie chips found in vending machines. I called the 1-800 number on the back of the package for Kraft foods and was told that ONLY food vendors received the product that I was looking for and they were not available to the general public."
4,great,good product strong a bit tricky and gets hot if left out in sun but durable and looks nice my pond has green alge that gets in the wrinkles but overall is great product
5,Great deal on high quality item,"This liner has now been in my pond for 3 months. It's very heavy duty but still pliable. The textured side means I can step in my pond if I need to, with less risk of falling."
4,Pond liner by Sunterra,"I just recently purchased the pond liner, so far so good, it was easy to work with. I feel this was a good purchase as I did compariable pricing and size."
4,amozon pond liner,"I used this for a water storage tank for my new solar hot water system that I just built. So far it seems to be holding up just fine. If the time ever comes that I need to expand my system, I will buy another one."
3,"Wrong pan, but excellent customer service from this seller","This is NOT the original finish, as was advertised-- it has that new soy-based coating on it. Supposedly you can remove it by baking the pan, but who knows if it all comes off, and that's not what I was paying for anyway.I contacted the seller, who responded immediately and issued a full refund. No hesitation, no questions asked. Excellent customer service from this seller (Ideal True Value.)If you are lucky enough to find a true Lodge original finish, scoop it up, because they don't make those anymore. Nobody seems to know if the new coating is safe. Personally, I doubt it, and I don't want that residue in my food."
5,beautiful cd!,i actually bought this cd as a surprise for my brother who is a musician and loves flamenco music. i listened to it and was blown away by how beautiful and passionate this entire cd is in comparison to other flamenco music i've heard. every moment of every song is fantastic and i highly recommend this cd to flamenco lovers. my brother aggrees! God has truly given this man a tremendous talent.
5,Eureka! The Perfect Family Tent,We went through four different tents and this one was by far the best to set up and the space available for everyone is great! My daughter's favorite part are the cup holders and shelves just her size.
4,Good 3-season tent,"The tent is very spacious and airy. That may be the reason it can be colder than some of the tents which are smaller and not as well ventilated. A word of caution - make sure it is well staked down or the shape makes it take off like a sail. We went camping in Yellowstone this summer and the wind blew it around as we were putting it up. Also, the size can make it harder to find a good camping site."
4,Good 4 person tent,"Unfortunately our family has 5 people. With duffel bags and winter coats for fall camping we have no room to maneuver. As we are now going to be a family of 6 we'll need to upgrade.However, we've had this tent for 10 years and it has served us well, rarely leaked. Once when we had a lantern hanging it pooled water and leaked. The zipper never snagged. This year, however, a pole broke. We don't like the way the poles don't stay engaged while we are assembling the tent."
3,"good light, bad sound","This thing comes with a glass ball with bubbles in it that has a flat bottom which rests on the electronic part. The color changes from blue to red to green in a continuous cycle. So far, so good. It's very pretty to look at; a bit like fiber-optics. But the sound on mine was lousy. The machine makes a slight grinding noise as it changes from one color to another and you hear that sound over the ""nature sounds"" that it's supposed to make. I just leave the sound part off and all you get is the white noise of the colors changing. The birds/crickets/whatever chirping behind the noise of the color changes just annoyed me, since you couldn't hear them very well. But I like the color part, so I'm still glad I bought it. And if it stops working, you've got this little clear glass paperweight..."
4,better than maximum,i bought the maximum audio biography and was disappointed to hear an english chick talking about reznor's grandpa. I've heard it all before. Trent actually talks on this cd so it makes it worth owning. I reccomend it for die-hard fans.
1,To Darn quiet,"I bought this MP3 player expecticting that I could listen to it on a buss full of people, but the things max volume is about the equuizilent of a whispering ant. DONT BUY THIS UNLESS YOUR GOING TO LISTEN TO IT IN A SILENT ROOM ALL BY YOURSELF!"
1,Not a recommended buy,"I just bought the jamp3 and I have to say I'm taking if back to the store. I had problems loading it on Windows 2000. After following the work-around for this , it was more troble than it was worth. Next I installed it on Windows 98. I had trouble trying to reformat the internal memory. Then for some unknown reason, it would load more than 5 songs. To me it will be worth spending a little bit more to get a better quality item"
3,Average Product,"This product, although average, can be a decent buy for the main reason that it is upgradeable with MMC cards. I think however, that it is still a bit overpriced for what it does and it isn't exactly that small of an mp-3 player. What sort of makes up for it is that it has what seems to be a fairly decent plastic belt clip for those who want to wear it during exercise or other activities. I guess it would make a good secondary mp-3 player for those who would not want to take their primary, more expensive player around with them to some places where it could get dirty or scratched up."
1,Poor choice with so many others available!,Beware of buying this if you have Windows XP!This little item has caused countless hours of frustration. KB Gears website has the e-mail tech support routed to the webmasters address (which I am sure he loves)and their tech support phone number (NOT toll free) has been disconnected. Hmmmmm I wonder why. Do yourself a favor and spend more money on better product!
4,"Why all the ""slam"" reviews?","The thing is reasonably priced, and it works OK.I don't like the PC interface much at all, but the combo of iTunes (which is adapted from Soundjam)and the Mac software works GREAT. I have the 32 meg card and have had as many as 30 songs on it (encoded @ 64kbps) and they are of very listenable quality.It takes a little planning before you put songs in it. So what, you didn't pay $200 for it either.I think it's a great ""entry model"" into mp3.I'm keeping it!!!"
1,This Mp3 player stinks,I originally bought this at [a local store] for $... I didn't know much about mp3s then and I figured that 16 mb's was alot but it isn't. The second this bad about it was the battery level. After playing about two songs the battery life is almost dead. I bought two brand new batteries and they were dead by the end of the day. If i were you I would avoid this mp3 player.
1,Poor volume/ no winows XP,"First used item with windows 98, it worked ok but volume is very low and will not go very loud. I returned item and new Jamp3 has same problem. I just upgraded computers, I now have windows XP, I cannot get software to work with XP. I can find no support from KB gear. Item way overpriced on this web site."
3,Not as complete...,"This set brings welcome CD debuts of the Tchaikovsky #4 and the violin concerto with Campoli (briefly released on CD by the late, excellent Beulah label from England). But where are the Argenta stereo recordings made by DECCA in Spain? Some of these, such as Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez with Narciso Yepes remain audiophile references on LP, as well as the complete Albeniz Goyescas, Falla's El Sombrero de Tres Picos, Noches en los Jardines de España and El Retablo de Maese Pedro among others. All of these titles, plus many of Argenta's zarzuela recordings are only available on CD in Spain.Maybe this set should have been titled ""The Complete DECCA recordings cleared for reissue."""
5,Haven,"I love this show! Can't wait until next season! The quality of the video was excellent, no problems at all."
3,ok,the only problems is that I can't share with my family because the digital recording does not have Spanish audio nor subtitles so this fact is forcing me to bay the actual disk instead. this is very bad
2,Please end this season,"I really hope Haven closes out this season. They are now bringing in a token black detective who has a personality that clashes not just with the main characters, but the whole setting of the series."
5,love this show,"This is an excellent mystery, characters, and acting....love the beautiful setting and looking forward to finding out more about the Colorado Kid"
4,Fun show!,"Fun story telling, interesting characters. Was a blast for a rainy afternoon when one wants to stay curled up inside!"
4,King of story-telling,"Haven captures the imagination. The third season moves a bit slower than the first two as attempts to draw out the series fail to provide adequate resolution to long drawn out plot points. However, taken individually, the episodes are intriguing enough to keep me watching."
5,Best Season so Far!,This has been the best season yet! A great character driven show! The character development is excellent and the more background that is revealed about each character the more interesting it gets... special surprises about Vince and Dave are revealed in the last few episodes. And the double love triangle was an unexpected twist.I just hope they don't jump the shark next season!
4,Nice build-up to the season finale,I can't wait to see how season four kicks off this fall. It will definitely take some clever writing to pull it off.
5,super fun,"This is a fun show. Love the characters. Kinda silly, sweet, a good show. good to watch and relax with."
5,Haven Season 3,Haven Season 3 is a facinating series. I am addicted to watching Eric Balfore as Duke. Clever plot -really different.
5,Great series.,I've really enjoyed this series. Better than average acting and story lines. Great scenery if you like New England coast shots. I've only watched three shows from season 3 but I'm looking forward to watching the rest of them. Too bad that they aren't part of the $0.00 Amazon Prime shows.
5,Love this show!,"Absolutely love this show, I do wish the seasons were a little longer but as long as they keep the show going I'm happy! Yes some things about it can get a little ""silly"" but I think you get that with every type of sci-fi, and it's certainly not beyond tolerable levels like some other shows get. =D"
5,great show,This is one of my favorite shows. Great characters and all the shows have an interesting plot. It is well worth watching.
4,"Great lube, annoying packaging","I love this lube, works just like the toxic stuff and doesn't kill sperm. I do wish it would come in a bottle or some other more convenient packaging. I like it better than the preseed applicators."
1,Not worth it even if it was free,I bought this item at a computer show to see if I would like to use it instead of a mouse for photoshop. I am sure if it worked correctly I would have liked it better.Pros noneCons 1. Software had a virus but I guess that was because I got it at a show.2. Company is out of business and it was hard to get the correct drivers and fixes. I needed to search the internet to get the drivers and fixes. No tech support because of the company being out of business.3. After getting it to work the pressure sensitivity was not good. You needed to press very hard to write.4. Cord for the pen to short for lefties.
1,Junk- Do your homework before buying this one...,"I have had nothing but problems with this piece of junk. From what I have found out, people with XP have nothing but problems with this.I GUESS THIS SHOWS WHY THEIR COMPANY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS!!!"
1,VIRUSES ON MFG SOFTWARE CAUTION !!!,"I did not read the prior reviews, I bought this item & loaded the software that came with it in the sealed box from Target.com. The MFG SOFTWARE disc contains TWO VIRUSES one in Quicktime & the other in Totally Hip files. Target has been notified that the software is CORUPT with viruses & that the MFG has gone out of business. This item is only useful as a drawing tablet thru other software programs like paint shop pro as there is no WEB SITE ACCESS or tech support available for this item."
1,Stay away...,"This thing [is terrible]. KBgear has gone bankrupt and thus no new drivers will ever be made. If you had a prior rebate with them, it will not be honored and legally they are not bound to honor it either! To add insult to injury, no drivers were ever available for Windows 2000, and of course there are none for XP. Stay far away from this and the company that ripped off thousands of people."
3,Drivers for Jam Studio...,"Hello,I had a hard time finding the drivers for Jam Studio, so I thought that I would post them here to help anyone who may need one.Here are a few links to the drivers. I used one and it works great!http://www2.driverguide.com/uploads/uploads17/14985.htmlhttp://www2.driverguide.com/uploads/uploads15/10814.htmlhttp://www.jdr.com/interact/item.asp?itemno=USB-TABLETI thought the tablet was very beginner, but it works. Ya get what ya pay for!Thanks,Anne"
2,Overall: functional.,"This tablet serves its purpose very well, thats it. Once you start to use it, it loses sensiblity pretty quickly. The plastic sheet that I thought would serve as tracking must be for something else because you just cant see what you are drawing. The cable for the pen is not too bothersome, but I would prefer a wireless one. The tablet looks like a cheap plastic toy. Setup is a little bit of a mess because of wires (a tangle of them) and drivers. In fact, now that I have sold this tablet, Ill settle for a Wacom tablet as I originally intended."
1,Worthless...,"Reading the specs, it seemed like an adequate, yet inexpensive way to try out an input tablet. Unfortunately, it's completely useless. It advertises 128 pressure levels of sensitivity, if I recall correctly, but essentially, it seems like you always have to either be very careful in order to be able to differentiate between moving/positioning and clicking/drawing, or you have to push so hard to get it to register that it quickly becomes tiring. Either way, I found it was much easier to simply draw using the mouse, and if the tablet can't beat the mouse at that task, what is it good for? If you really want a tablet, I've heard good things about the Wacom line, but they're significantly more expensive, of course."
1,should have done more research...,"I bought this tablet because of the cheap price. From what i could tell from the specs it wasn't a bad tablet considering it was [inexpensive]. Well, I now know the reason. The company went bankrupt, I had to do a lot of searching to find the windows 2000 drivers. Some kind person was nice enough to place them on their own website after hearing that the company was no longer supporting the product. I cannot recall the URL unfortunately or else i would have posted it. Works terribly with photoshop. The drawing method is clumsy and not well thought out and the drivers allow for almost no customization. If the shipping didn't cost just about as much as the product itself i would send it back. I suggest anyone looking to get a tablet go with waycom."
3,ehh it's ok,"they are great for what your looking for. not knocking the product for what it does or is, but my dog (chihuahua/pomeranian) did not like it. i think its cute when he flips it up on his head like a person but mostly he hates them. i however thought they were adorable on him."
3,"kinda confusing, okay overall","i read this book for a chemistry class, and although it was usually fairly clear, which helped a lot, at times the author broke into the first person and started making jokes in the text, which really bugged me. additionally, the examples of problems in the text were usually much easier than the problems at the end of the chapters, so since i couldn't look in the text for help, i was often stumped.additionally, the text sometimes asked the reader questions like ""why does this happen,"" without providing the answer anywhere. if you didn't know the answer, you obviously weren't gonna learn it, and as a busy college student, i wasn't gonna spend fifteen minutes looking up the answer to these minor questions that should have just been answered in sentence form, as this is a textbook, after all, not a test. my teacher provided those, and thats why i need the text book.all in all, the book was usually clear, which i liked, but it had some structural faults i didn't."
4,Correct book; wrong format,"The book is the right one I needed for class. There is, however, an issue with the book's description on the website - it is listed as hardcover, when in fact it is paperback."
4,Exploring Chemical Analysis,The book is easy to follow and they present the concepts in a way that people will be able to understand easily. Very useful book.
4,Good deal,"I bought Exploring Chemical Analysis at a very affordable price, I think it was around $35 or $40, which was much more cheaper than purchasing it in a hundred something from the school bookstore. The book was in the perfect condition described, particularly since it was paperback. I received the order in a imely manner, which was about a week after placing the order. Unfortunately, due to a change in my major's curriculum, I won't be needing this book as I might not study Analytical Chemistry."
4,exploring chemical analysis book,"This book is exactly what i was looking for, and it was in very good condition; there was only a single waterstain on one of the inside pages, but the material was still very useable and the rest of the book was very clean. The sender sent the book in a very timely manner and i received it very quickly."
3,Decent Textbook,"This text has many of the necessary statistical tests ans analysis for analytical chemistry classes. It does have some odd examples and is hard to follow at times. Overall, it is a helpful book, but could be more useful containing more statistics and better examples"
4,What do you expect?,"This is an analytical chemistry textbook, not exactly the most thrilling of chemical disciplines. (unless you are an analytical chemist). It explains things fairly well, and the problems are at the end of the chapters are pretty similar to what you would find on the ACS test for analytical chemistry. The author has a sense of humor and randomly inserts jokes in some of the material. I believe this is the most popular of textbooks for analytical/quantitative chemistry courses."
4,Very good book.,This is a really good book for someone taking and Analytical Chemistry course for the first time. Detailed explanation and easy to understand statements. Recommend it to anyone.
2,Analytical Chemistry Textbook,"I am not a fan of this textbook for an in depth, upper level chemistry class. The first thing my class did was learn the statistical analysis tests and t-test seem to be a pretty basic subject, however this book only had 1 eqn, compared to the 4 EQNS my professor gave us. This book may be a bit more suited to a lower level, general analytical chem. class."
4,1986 Chevy P30 Chassis,The Chilton Manual - Repair for 1967 - 1986 is very helpful in repairing these older Chevy/GMC vehicles.My vehicle is an Airstream 1984 motor home and it has been diffecult to find good Chevy P30 Chassis information.This manual provides some of the needed info for engine systems. However it does not have steering system info for class A motorhomes.There are many fuel system and electrical system resources. Overall it was a good purchase.
3,"Great content, would be a 5 if had more photos","Chilton is the automotive repair bible for sure. I love the info, the details and the practical step-by-step. For those not familiar with engines (like me) it's wonderful, and would be even better with more photos. I've owned Chilton manuals for all my vehicles since I first started driving in 1972. They helped ease me into working on my own vehicles.Great book for newbies, women, men and teens. Easy to read and very good for reference. Highly recommend it."
3,It's Ok But I Like Their Previous Albums Better,"Their first album was their best. Toxicity was better as well. However, it's better than Steal This Album. If you want to check out some groups that are political try out Skinny Puppy's The Greater Wrong of the Right and Ministry's Houses of the Mole. I think they're better efforts than this one."
5,MORE RADIO\VIDEO PLEASE!!!,This is by far my most favorite System of a down album now! And this was confirmed when I heard Radio\Video As soon as they break into the Reggae\Ska on this song I got chills down my spine because they did it so well! Please system convert more Reggae into your songs because it freaking rocks!!!!
1,I Still Can't Believe,"I cant believe people actualy take this band serious at all, Ive always thought the sounded like Weird Al."
2,So Overrated,"System of A Down has always been one of those bands that has never had to worry about talent because even crap can be popular now too! I guess if ranting over the microphone in what is the worst conceived metal band ever then this nutjob frontman has what it takes. I'm going to just throw a few good rock cd's out there and maybe you'll do yourself a favor and pick one up...Into the Heavy? : the new American Headcharge, Blindside, Hotwire, and yes...Slipknot is still acceptable.Into Rock? : Breaking Point's new release, Cold's ""A Different Kind Of Pain"", or Jonah33's new cd ""The Strangest Day"""
1,Political B.S,Can we please leave the politcal B.S to the corrupt politicians. I don't need to hear this crap in my music.I would have given them 0 stars if it were available. They might be a good band if they could write some decent songs.
2,Don't buy it!,"Man am I upset. Debut album was so awesome, Toxicity was good. Their dubut is my favorite album period. This Mezmerize is such a huge disappointment cause they are much better than this. Old School Hollywood and Violent Pornography are the worst songs I ever heard, made me sick to my stomach. I found 2 songs that are listenable, B.Y.O.B. isn't one of them. I think these guys need some counseling."
2,SOAD at its worst,"That moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true SOAD fan. Ive been a SOAD fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential. SOAD was a great album and Toxicity was sweet and Steal This Album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt SOAD at all. Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better."
2,"Daron, please shut up","Other than BYOB this album is fairly disposable. I wasnt even going to buy this album, but after a few listens to BYOB i thought it could be a pretty good listen. I was wrong in thinking this. Daron Malakian's voice i just cannot take. System of a Down has talent, but they dont utilize it here. They're at their best when playing off-timed songs with good chorus and vocals from Serj (who by the way is in good form on this album) I guess I would like this album a ton more if Malakian would just sing in the background or not at all. It just doesnt work for me. I strongly recommend the self titled or Toxicity over this one, maybe the forthcoming ""Hypnotize"" album will be better than this one"
1,Is This Supposed To Be A Joke?,"Holy s**t, this album must be a joke. The guitar playing totally sucks, and the vocals are just so f**king stupid. B.Y.O.B. is the most played song and the stupid part in it where the singer goes: ""La la la la"" is just hilariously ridiculous. Sorry, but this CD sucks."
1,Bogus,"I could go on for days about how I dislike this album. If you are looking for anything remotely creative, interesting or perhaps different, then this isn't your CD. I think SOAD needs to spend less time whining about politics and more time focusing on making quality music.What is the real joke here? SOAD talks about unfairness, crooked politicans and people just out for money and power. That is pretty funny considering they released an album clocking in at 38 minutes and they are going to release part 2 sometime in November. They could have just made one solid album filled with songs, instead they decided to split the album in 2 essentially doubling their profits. What a bunch of hypocrits."
4,not as good as toxicity but still great,"now, granted this is a really short album, it has good songs and it shows a lil more maturity with some punk influence in it, evident in some songs, maybe i'm the only one that picked up on the punk influence, i dunno but i like the cd...it has its down moments in radio/video and old school hollywood bu.... upsides far outweight the downs. like Question! is a better song, simple yet elegant. B.Y.O.B is a great anti-war song that is one of the harder ones on the cd. Cigaro, which many people don't realize and i didn't until i read the lyrics, is talking about the armenian genocide which is a part of their heritage...just read the lyrics, ya'all will know what i'm talking about. and sad statue is one of the better songs also with a catchy chorus and catchy riffs leaving this cd not as good as toxicity or their selftitled, but still great in it's respects...just hope hypnotize will be longer...."
2,Worst Album So Far,"This album has absolutely no lyrical content to it. Most of their songs have very good lyrics but this cd lacks any at all.Also missing is one of the things I like most about SOAD. Besides the hardcore metal they also make some amazing slower songs. eg. Spiders, Atwa, Roulette. Mesmerize does not have a song close to any of those on this album.Hopefully Hypnotize is actually worth the money."
5,one of the greatest cds ever made,"for me their are some cds that surpass awesomeness i'd say they are ultra-mega awesome those are ""NWA-Straight Outta Compton""""Nirvana-Nevermind""""Rage Against the Machine""""KoRn-Issues""""Mudvayne-Ld 50""""Cypress Hill-Black Sunday"" and of course ""System of a down-Mesmerize"" like all the cds above mesmerize has great songs about real-life problems the songs are even more memorable than all the cds i mentioned above seriously songs like byob,cigaro,statue,violent pornography, hell every song on this cd was stuck in my head the first month i had this cd its the only cd i listened to 5 times in a couple of weeks and i have a lot of cds if you hear someone talking trash about this or any othe soad album just ignore it and buy this great cd"
2,"Stupid people say stupid things,","Smart people outsmart each other, then themselves. Oh those were the good old days. This cd is horrific, i feel like i want to cry. Their debut was spectacular, toxicity was subpar(why every one prefers it over their self titled is beyond me)and steal this album was brilliant in some places. What has happened!!! The lyrics are totaly trite. The same line repeated over and over again. I saw byob on the tele and got all worked up, well ive never been so let down in my life. Daron sounds like a whiny prepubecent teenager. I cant stand hes voice. Hes also to blame for the decline in lyrics. Normaly serj's department. I just hope hypnotise is all serj to make up for this mess. Please!!!"
2,more political rants...can we get back to the music please?,"Well here we have a band that could have been the next great thing but instead did not seem to have enough creative talent to do anything other than spit out anti-american blather. I really like these guys, this band is a great rock band, but their messages just fall short with me.The lead singer's voice is still intense but does not seem to carry the same punch that we saw on Toxicity. The anti-war and anti-corporate messages are felt by many, however, without the wars of past or the corporations of the present, these guys would not even have a job. Toxicity covered a lot of ground and I personally wish they would get back to that format. Still a fan so I'll stick around and see what's coming out from them down the pipe. With the exception of this album I like all of their other ones."
2,The downfall of rating after you hear it for the first time,"After about a month with the new cd I realised how much I really didn't like it. Lots of it is repetitive and annoying. There are only a few good songs, and they're all being ruined thanks to the radio. The first and second albums are the only worth listening to. Thank you radio, for producing disposable music."
3,"Almost Thrash, but still a little nu-metal","Best Soad album yet. BYOB has riffs like Slayer or Megadeth, but has that stupid ""Party Section.""Intro 3/5BYOB 5/5 almost thrash and "" WHY DO THEY ALWAYS SEND THE POOR?""Revenga 5/5 another near thrash songCigaro 4.5/5 starts out like death metal, then states how big Malakians penis isRadio/Video 4/5Coicane 4/5 real fastViolent Porno 4/5Question 4/5Sad statue 4/5Old school holly wood 3/5hollywood 3/5"
3,"the price was mezmerizing,! The product, eh.","I received this product, and I was very excited (C'mon, System of a Down on Vinyl!) I got it pretty fast, but the packaging was not up to par, I'm surprised it did not break in transit. The disc was slightly scratched from sliding around the disproportional plastic sleeve. It was new though, just freshly scuffed. Played fine, except for one track, the first one on the A side, that was scratched the most. Ah well. Otherwise, Awesome find! Love the vinyl sound, definitely a conversation starter."
4,System Of A Down Rocks!by Clay Fillbach,"hi.me.clay again.you may remember me from the my chemical romance review i wrote on 12/14/05.i'm giving mezmerize 4 stars cause i like system of a down...they're just not my total favs.i have 1 cd...mezmerize.my favorites would hafta be ""b.y.o.b."",""cigaro"",""old school hollywood.my favorite bands would hafta be green day or my chemical romance.but still...as i said...system of a down is still a great band.so...please,system of a down...don't come to my house and kill me for only giving you 4 stars.rock on.clay."
4,almost as good as toxicity,the lyrics are wonderful and their message is as good as always. yet the overall feel of the album is just shy of the greatness of toxicity. some of that comes from the fact that Serj's incredible voice is used much less here than before.
3,cd,Ok. This is the second one I have listed too and I really dont like it much. The music is very different then what i am used too.
5,SYSTEM MESMERIZE,"I really enjoy Mesmerize. After two masterpieces and Steal this album, System of a Down was in the top of the metal world. Mesmerize brings the absolutely classics B.Y.O.B, Revenga and Cigaro.All the songs are nice unique metal pieces. Mesmerize and Hipnotize are classic modern Thrash Metal."
2,Overblown,"I was never really a big fan of them, But i did like ""Aerials"". So Mezmerize is the first of a 2 album relese for 2005 from System of a Down, The next album will come out this winter. But man was this a let downHere's why.1. Soldier Side - Intro: Stupid and pointless2. B.Y.O.B.: Sucked, The vocals from serj get a little silly here3. Revenga: Ok4. Cigaro: Funny for the first 2 listens, Then it gets old5. Radio/Video: Yawn6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song: Serj sounds insane on this one.7. Violent Pornography: Same thing here, Man is this song stupid8. Question!: Im shocked9. Sad Statue: This song is ok10. Old School Hollywood: I liked it11. Lost in Hollywood: Best song on the whole albumHope the next one is better"
2,annoying!!!!!!!,"Very short, whiney, gay-rock at its worst! Lyrics are a bunch of meaningless crap, NOTHING compared to older thought-provoking material of theirs. Two thums down! Can't believe people are recommending this album- there's something wrong with y'all! System could have done much better than this after 3 years!"
1,System of a Down forgot how to write songs...,"I listen to the radio (or I used to, at least), and most of what I hear now is just absolute crap. No one seems to have a concept of rythm, harmony, or key anymore. I've seen many new bands that just suck get wide recognition for talentless crap.Though, very rare is it that a band that had a few good albums turn into something that is just awful and get praised for it! SOAD used to be able to write songs that were composed fairly well, but their new album isn't even composed! It sounds like they had a bunch of parts of songs and then smashed them together at random. That's not composision, that's lazyness.This is coming from someone who used to love SOAD. I have every album, I have an unauthorized DVD of their bio, I saw them at Ozzfest. I LOVED this band.But, now they have lost whatever they had going for them. Too bad."
5,cant wait for hynotize,"this album is pure genius, just like in the last albums, hardly any of the lyrics make much sense, but in a way that only SOAD can get away with a make sound great.i bought this album only really because i liked the previous stuff, so i knew i would like this, and i'm so glad i did.i cant wait 'til hynotise comes out i WILL be getting it too.(as far as i know it'll be out September 27th, i could be wrong though, my source wasn't as reliable as i'd like it to be)"
4,an excellent...double album?,"This album is excellent, in some ways better than Toxicity. All of the songs have a great Melodic sound, and all have deep political messages. The infuriating thing is it's just over a half hour long, and yet they plan to release the second half this fall. Why not put them on one CD...is SOAD buying into the cruel cheating dishonest capitalist system, trying to squeeze a larger profit outta this?"
3,Mezmerize,"2 1/2 starsOverall, this is a decent album. For the genre, it is definitely one of the better, most diverse cds around. Either the guys from SOAD are musical geniuses, or just good at making things work. Most of the songs are incredibly interesting musically, particularly Radio/Video, which features screaming metal, polka, and hints of Jamaican influence, all one after the other. Somehow, the transitions are fluent and interesting to listen to, which hides the fact that it's a terrible song. I love it. I'm not sure why, but SOAD is very good at writing terrible music and performing it incredibly well, so we fall in love with bad music. People I've talked to agree, it's pointless music that is impossible to stop listening to. Simple, repetive, catchy melodies make SOAD's music very interesting to listen to, not to mention incredibly hard to get out of your head.musicfishreviews.blogspot.com"
1,Absolute S#!T!,"What the hell has happened to rock if this passes off as metal. I mean, seroiusly, in metal, you don't sing about ""goin' to the party and have a real good time."" Talk about poser, and then they spout a bunch a stupid rules. Anyone who listens to this corporate crap is a nimrod. Every time I see a kid with those damn system of a down shirts, i wanna ring them out like a wash rag. Alright, i guess you know how i feel know, so i guess ill let you in on something, let some fu@$!%ng taste. Here's some good bands: The Sex Pistols, the Ramones, the Clash, Anti-Flag Green Day, Blink-182, Metallica, Queen, and the Rolling Stones. Don't waste your dough."
1,This mother sucks,"Oh my God, I would'nt even piss on this thing if it was on fire.I can buy toilet paper for a lot cheaper than $15.00. If you like this album at all, then you should go ahead and kill yourself because you are of no use to mankind. Oh yeah, they won't let you rate things with 0 stars so I had to give it one. This thing barely deserves my trash talking."
1,"DONT BUY- BURN, OR FILE SHARE",NOT WORTH THE MONEY- DONT MAKE THESE FAKE POLITICIANS RICH- THEY ARE LAUGHING AT YOU- THEY SUCK- THEY CANT PLAY MUSIC FOR CRAP
1,"ignore the 1 star, i cant change it to 5 for some reason","As you may or may not know, i reviewed this disk awile ago, saying it sucked..well, i change my mind alot, and am here to say that SOAD f@ckin' rule, i love all their stuff, old and new.Serj and Daron both have great voices, and the lyrics are hilarious, SOAD are awsome, get all of their s**t."
1,Lame and Lamer,"This group is just plain godawful, I Can't even believe that many people think this is the best album of the year, system has always been a bad rock band, this album should have called the headache, I Despise this band, I Understand they don't like bush and I Agree with them, but enough is enough, this is a tired retread of the 1998 album which was much better than this.This is the G-Unit of the political rap rock world.Thumbs way down for me."
5,SOAD's Masterpiece (pt.1)...,"I am a fan of the old, raw sound of their first outings just as much as any other 'system' fan; but there is no doubt that 'Mezmerize' and 'Hypnotize' far surpass the former discs' musicallity and songwriting. 'Mezmerize' is the first disc in the 2005 SOAD masterpiece, and could easily be tagged as their best. I personaly look at 'Mezmerize' and 'Hypnotize' together as one album because they were recorded at the same time and I am thoroughly impressed. These two discs are metal masterpieces that will most likely never be forgotten...don't miss out."
3,weak for SOAD,"the first real, new, full release since the GODLIKE Toxicity, Mezmerize does nothing but disappoint. it's catchy at first listen. but give it couple more listens and you'll be sick of it. i've been a long time SOAD fan and i must say that this is the worst release yet. especially with Hypnotize now released. Hypnotize is the second half to the 2005 SOAD opus and it puts Mezmerize to shame. Most of the songs on Mezmerize don't even have verses, they are just the same choruses repeated over and over again.The one exception on this album is Question! this is a classic and i can never get enough of it.Another problem is that it has only 10 tracks, and only 9 of them are songs! thats really disappointing. BUT as a loyal fan, own it. add it to the collection."
5,SOAD is the greatest band ever!!!!!,"If you like metal or rock you should fall in love with this CD. It isn't their heaviest album, but it is well worth the buy. I suggest you pick it up NOW if you hav'nt yet. I am a big Hardcore, Metalcore lover, and just because this isn't really that heavy, it still belongs right next to my In Flames and Slipknot albums. This is by far the best album I have picked up in 2005, and I have bought alot of CDs this year.-Metalheads Rule-"
3,Strangely addictive,"I bought this when I was in Iraq, I must have listened to it every day at the gym. The good is the music, its probably the best music wise the band has ever done. Vocal wise its ok...unlike Toxcity its less more outragious and thats a bad thing. Its downright annoying. Some songs are literally ruined by the vocals. Is almost like they aren't even trying. The music and chorus' make up for the horrible vocals but because of this its really not a complete record in my opinion. I remember listening to it at work and a co worker said. This guy is the worst singer, this sucks. Then later another said the same thing. Its hard to enjoy music when the vocals get on your nerves."
4,it's pretty good.,"i originally bought the hypnotize album, but i ended up with this one in the hypnotize case.however this album is worth buying.the best songs are: revenga, b.y.o.b., question, sad statue, and lost in hollywood. it's probably just as good as hypnotize."
3,expected a harder album,I love system of a down and believe me I like this album and it is way better then what is coming out now in days but I wish that daron would stick to guitar because I like serj's voice so much better. This is alot softer then there previous release's but I would buy it again. If you dont have there self titled album yet what are you waiting!!!!
5,AMAZING CD BUT ITS TO SHORT....,"THIS A GREAT FOLLOW UP TO TOXICITY BUT ONLY 11 SONGS AND EVEN A BONUS TRACK, WITHOUT THE BONUS TRACK ITS ONLY 35 MINUTES. THAT IS THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT THIS CD OTHER THAN THAT ITS A REALLY SOLID EFFORT FROM SYSTEM OF A DOWN. I CANT WAIT FOR HYPNOTIZE, HOPEFULLY THEYLL STILL RELEASE IT LATER THIS YEAR LIKE THEY SAID, I CANT WAIT ANOTHER 4 YEARS FOR A NEW CD FROM THEM."
2,What is going wrong?,"System started with a sound that grabbed you, spun your head around, and never let you forget it. Toxicity was a very good album also. Steal this album was good, but you could tell it was scrap tracks.This album.... how do I start......Darin seriously needs to shut up and play guitar. I think hes taking his sweet revenge out on us with his horrid singing.Serj.... what can i say... he is by far one of the most talented vocalists out there. Such quality with no effort at all. This guy is going to shine something fierce.I hope hypnotize is closer to their first to than to this one. A few of these tracks grew on me, but there first album reached out and stole me. Cmon guys, get your sh*t together and rock my fu**ng head off...."
2,Pitiful.,"Mezmerize sounds like the band wasn't even trying. There are maybe two or three decent songs on this strangely short album, and allowing their guitarist to scream and wail throughout half the album was one of the worst decisions in the history of music. Not only is Serj sidelined, but the lyrics are no longer surreal and political in an interesting-if-stupid way like they were in Toxicity and Steal This Album. Now the lyrics have crossed the line to being just plain stupid. They alternate between banal, uncreative political whining and complete nonsense.Skip this album and hope like hell that Hypnotize turns out better."
2,Dissapointed,"Oh man..... Before this album System was one of my favorite bands... This new album angers me... first of all Daron sings WAY too much. His voice sounds like a drowning weasel when compared to Serj. Although his voice is a good addition in some songs, when he sings in every song... its taxing... The guitars, while okay dominate every song... the drums and bass are flat. And short.... 11 songs... 38 min.... why do you need 2 CD's for that many songs? why not put them on one CD? if they have more on the second song... why not release them at once as a dual CD album?CAUSE THEY SOLD OUT.... DARON DRIVES A DAMN HUMMERThey really have destroyed my respect for them... which was great at one point... even their anti-bush anti-corp is getting overdone....I swear if the new tool or pearl jam albums suck.... i'm commiting suicide"
1,I AGREE- Horribel singer,without him id buy this- he keeps me away- god riffs- BAD VOCALS--and the lyrics are kinda stupid- they try too hard.
1,F**K Darons singing,He is one of the worst singers I have ever heard. He needs to stay off the mic and just keep playing the guitar. He ruins pretty much the whole cd.
3,Finally an average SOAD CD :-(,"Well I've been a fan od SOAD since their first CD - before most people even heard of them before. Toxicity was a terrific followup to a flawless debut, and Steal this albumn was great too. So when I heard BYOB on the radio, and Cigaro, I was like ""sweet! Looks like it's time for another killer SOAD cd!!!""Boy has this CD dissapointed! The songs are just lackluster, and don't offer the same interest or songwriting as before. Less aggression (except for maybe 3 songs)...and more singing. I'm not against singing more, but it's just not what I want to hear from SOAD.Anyway...I didn't like their other cd's upon first listen...so MAYBE I'll like this one more in the future, but I've listened to it about 5 or 6 times, and it's subpar."
1,System of a DUD!,"Loved BYOB. But the rest was a complete disappointment. I appreciate your views guys and even agree with some but a little less incoherent ranting, PLEASE! Unfortunately I bought this album because of one song. That didn't even begin to justify what I paid for it. I tried repeatedly to listen to this CD. After a week of several failed attempts I gave it to my nephew. He loved it. Perhaps I am getting old."
2,WHY?,"I love soad and their music but why on earth do they allow malakian to sing so much. They are still good but i think they good be great without so much singing from malakian. Let serj do what he does best and stick to the guitar man. Does he even know how bad he sounds. And as for the live shows, ridiculous. Just play guitar i say."
5,Brilliant BLISTERING Slab of Intelligent Metal - Their BEST,"Tight, blistering guitars and short bursts of angry lyrics reminiscent of ""Sugar"" but more political, insightful, powerful and robust. THIS is the release we've been waiting for! BYOB and Sad Statue are real standouts -- but there's not one filler on the ENTIRE album. Fans of nu metal and old, fans of thrash and punk and hardcore will love it. A MUST HAVE for your collection."
5,"Fantastic, although short","I had been waiting for about four months since first I heard that SOAD was releasing a new album. Two days ago it finally arrived and has been playing nonstop since. All of the songs on this album are energetic, frantic yet beautiful all at the same time. My only gripe is that this album is very short, even moreso due to the fact that one of the tracks is an intro peice, giving them ten songs, and since two of their songs have been on their website for a while (B.Y.O.B. and Cigaro) that leaves anyone who really likes this band and visits their site occasionally, only 8 new songs to listen to. I have read some of the other reviews and yes, this album is a little overpowered by damon malakian doing the majority of the vocals, but I will say that I enjoy listening to him and Serj singing together. Bottom line...Any system song could sell on I tunes for $5 a song and be worth it. Buy this cd"
4,"Original, fun and it...ROCKS!","Much like the legendary DEEP PURPLE, System of a Down is also beyond category.This music is original, fun and it rocks!Quote of the month: ""Look, there goes Jimmy Page, the greatest white thief of black music, ever!"" - Homer Simpson"
4,mad mad music,"it's hard to know if SOAD are serious or trying to make a joke with the direction this is going. which, to me, is what makes this cd so mezmerize-ing. from political lyrics about our nation's actions, to critical hollywood satire, to lyrics that about made me pee my pants laughing. ""my *ock is bigger than yours, my *ock can walk right out the door!"" are you for real!?! ""tony danza cuts in line!"" - not in any metal song i've ever heard!?! ""choking chicks and sodomy, the kinda sh+t you see on your tv"" - which channel is that? gotta give it to them though: i'm hooked. i dont care if you want to compare it to ""steal this album"" or ""toxicity"". for me it's a different animal altogether. after 30 or so listens, i love the switch between scorching screams, super heavy headbanging rock, wierd-electronic rants and transcendant ballad-y preachiness. cant wait for part deux."
2,Biggest Let Down of 2005,"SYSTEM OF A DOWN - Mezmerize-My initial reaction was: They've gone from singing about the Armenian Genocide to singing about Gonorrhea and Tony Danza. That is still sadly my reaction.I tried so hard to like this CD. But they've let me down. Upon over 20 listens this still doesn't grow on me. There are a few good songs. Overall though this album is the decline of Musical Growth and the beginning of contented mediocre nu-metal. Sorry SOAD, I haven't even bothered checking out Hypnotize yet.So long and farewell... Money and Fame has taken creativity hostage.Favorite Songs: B.Y.O.B., Question, and Sad Statue.-2 Stars (And that's being generous!)IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?"""
4,short and sweet,"the first time i popped in the new system record i didn't know what to think. the album was great, but after a while the record stopped playing, shortly after i must add. then, i was like ""what the f#@$?"" i thought the cd was messed up or something, but the album had truly already ended. then, i heard system is coming out with second one soon (which is slated for release on november 22, by the way) and i rejoyced. the album is great at all angles, but i had to drop a star for the lack of length. three years is a long time to wait for a new album to be thirty minutes. i am planning to get the next album as well, but i think the albums should have been docked a couple of dollars. i am curious on what other people think on this subject. if you want to give me a shout, or give me an opinion i would be glad to hear it. my email addres is bcaffeineman@aol.com"
5,I'm now a SOADimite!,"I am more of a classic rock fan if anything, so I usually dispise metal, and I put it into the catagory of screaming into a microphone, but System of a Down is different. They mix loud melodic screaming with soft and beautiful sounding breaks in between. Each song is different in it's own way, which sets it apart from most metal. I admit must rock fans won't like, but if you are willing to give different genres a try, I say this is worth listening to if anything."
3,I love hearing political messages from high school dropouts,"Their sound has not changed though the world has in the 4 years since their last release. The political messages are singularly focused on anti-War, anti-establishment. The songwriting is good, but not as good as Toxicity their zenith.Toxicity is probably the best hard rock album of the 2000s. It is hard to believe it and U2s All That You Wnated are PRE-9/11 as both seemed to sum up something in the air so well, just the opposite feelings. Maybe these artists tapped into an unrest present before it even occurred, like an instinctual foreshadowing.I mention this, because the anti-war rhetoric here is pretty stagnant.It does also not help a song when the lyrics are political epiphanies from high school dropouts. Its just as bad as listening to Warren Beatty or Kurt Russel talk politics.Its like asking your dog how to fix the remote control.There blathering will influence millions of 15 year olds none the less. Who probably wont enlist."
5,Easily the Best Record of the Year,"This is pure visceral energetic creativity and a band that is truly at it's peak. Every second if this CD is brilliant and beyond entertaining (not to mention devoid of filler). Again, many of the lyrics are politically charged and satirical. It might be over the heads of some of you. The whole package is a completely natural progression for this band and I eagerly await Hypnotize."
3,Good But Not Good Enough For an S.O.A.D Album,Let me start by saying System of A Down has been my favorite band since their national inception. I think their self-titled album was amazing and yet was outdone by the brilliant Toxicity. As the release of the double discs approached I became frantic. The first songs released from Mezmerize showed a ton of promise but after listening to the album I found myself bored and disapointed. The album just wasn't what I thought it would be. It lacked many of the great elements that made the band so innovative. I think the perfect score would've been a 2.5 . All in all the album just lacks what makes system great.On a seperate note. I recently purchased Sikth's Death of A Dead Day which was an Amazon recommendation because I am a SOAD fan. All SOAD fans should run out and get this album. It's like System on speed and LSD.
4,I had an out-of-body experience the other day and it was Jesus,"Hmmm.Mesmerize is a good album, there's no denying that fact - it's full of catchy riffs and great melodies, which makes it very accessible. Which is exactly the problem - what happened to the originality and style of their first self-titled album?Compare Suite-Pee or Ddevil to Radio/Video or Lost In Hollywood for example. The latter tracks follow normal song structure a lot more than the other older tracks - System Of A Downs new work is still original, but nowhere near as much as it used to be.I'm hoping Hypnotize will reconcile my view of SOAD - I will be disappointed if it follows the example of Mesmerize.On the other hand, it's great to see Daron Malakian getting some extra vocal time - he's a great singer and it's about time he got a bit of the spotlight. And what's this about his voice being 'too normal', not as good as Tankian? What about BYOB and Cigaro?Overall, a good album, but not as good as their first album or toxicity."
4,Discourraged!!,"I would definitely recommend buying this album. However, there are few things you shoulkd know first.In this album Serj is not leading as strongly as before. This makes you miss his lovely and smart tunes sometimes. Politically, this album's songs have a good point. Being sarcastic about what happens in the world today , yet , telling every one what exactly is wrong with us is just what people are pleased to hear.The bad things about Mezmerize is that it gets you lost sometimes in the middle of a thought. Maybe the fact that Serj is not always there helps that.. but in conclusion, the songs are just not as KILLING as the ones in Toxicity- the album made me become a SOAD fan. Only this time I enjoyed listening to them for MOST of the time and not all.Line bottom is: Buy this album, but don't expect another Toxicity."
3,"Not bad, but not good.","Ehh, I actually don't like this CD a whole lot. It is very, VERY repetitive. Over and over the same words. Sure some of the other albums have done the same, but this is overboard. And I do agree that there is too much Daron. I like him getting more air time but this is just too much. They are much more face paced now too. Almost every song is super fast words to the point where you have no clue what they are talking about. Aside from that, I like the guitar riffs. BYOB is still a good song though, along with Question!. Those are probably the only 2 songs I listen to a lot on this album.The most recent CD I bought that blew me away was Fall Out Boy - From Under the Cork Tree. I remember the days when I bought a new CD from a band, it was always awesome. Just seems like a lot of music is getting worse."
5,IT'S ABOUT GOD DAMN TIME!!!!!,"First of all, these guys are incredible. I have been waiting so long for this release, and it was clear as soon as I heard ""Cigaro"" and ""B.Y.O.B"" that SOAD would be back and better than ever. The creativity and originality of this album is unrivaled. Mezmerize packs an instantly addicting punch of catchy riffs, vocal harmonies, and crazy screeching. Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian are two of the greatest collaborative minds in music today. Hypnotize is going to be amazing and it's coming out this year!Every track on this cd will absolutely ""mezmerize"" SOAD fans and possibly others. It's a must buy! Absolutely 5 stars. One of the best records I've heard in a long time, seeing as Steal This Album! came out like 3 years ago..."
2,"DISAPPOINTING, Hey Daron, shut up and give Serj back the mic!","I absolutely adored Toxicity. It had songs, these tracks sound like scraps left on the floor. None of these songs rank anywhere near their last album. I miss Serj's singing, I CANT STAND Darons 'little girl being tortured' sucky vocals. Once in a while in the background is OK, but his head has apparently swollen so big over sucess that it has cut off circulation to his brain and now he thinks his vocals are just as good as Serj. PLEASE! This CD has a moment or two, but Toxicity felt like songs/epics and these short bursts sound thrown together. The last two songs both have Hollywood in the title and the lyrics, boy that is some imagination. That figures because I read where Daron decided on the track sequence. Oh well, I'll still be curious about the next cd, but I don't have much hope, except that Serj's vocals are featured more, and Daron shuts the hell up!"
5,Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!,A brilliant album! Just as good as 'Toxicity' in my humble opinion. 'Question!' is my absolute favorite off the album and I am guessing it will become a single; Kind of reminiscent of 'Chop Suey!' in its orchestration. 'Viloent Pornography' and 'Sad Statue' topping out my top 3 tracks. 'BYOB' and 'Cigar' are well done too; The whole album displays the artistic and creative talents of this group and I really appreciate their work. They do things I would immagine would make most musicians cringe but they do it and make it work ( most of the time ). I guess that is what makes them stand out from the croud and have a very different and unique sound. I was not a fan of 'Steal This Album!' at all but loved 'Toxicity' and now 'Mesmerize'.
3,Tolerable,"I was really looking forward to buying this album when i heard that it had come out, so i purchased it and listened to it in my car and was very disapointed. There are only a handful of good songs on the album. The only one's worth listening to are B.Y.O.B., Question!, Radio/Video, and Revenga. The others are just ok, they sound like all of the other System of a Down filler songs on their other albums. S.O.A.D can blow you away if they really try on a few songs but can really disapoint as well with others. I wouldn't recommend you buy this album unless you see it on sale for under $10. It really isn't worth anymore than that especially since it's not even 40 minutes in length. i was able to finish the cd before i even got home from the mall. I just hope SOAD's new album coming out later this year packs more of a punch."
1,Can't I give this zero stars?,"May I quote the great Noel Gallagher of Oasis, just after he appeared on a bill these morons: ""After I heard System of a Down, I thought, I'm actually alive to hear the s***tiest band ever. Of all the bands that have gone before, and all the bands that'll be in the future, I was around when THE WORST was around""Couldn't have said it better myself, Noel!"
1,WOW,"i also agree with some of the reviews- THIS SINGER NEEDS TO TAKE SOME SERIOUS LESSONS- SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOYING- I BOUGHT THIS CD- WHY!!!!! IM GONNA SELL IT BACK- OK MUSIC- BAD VOCALS, BAD, BAD VOCALS- THEIR 1ST IS THEIR BEST- THEY ARE PUKE NOW"
1,What Happened?,"First off I want to say that anyone who gave this 4 or 5 stars is a Fu**ing idiot! This is the most un-inspred garbage from a band I greatly respected. SOAD's self titled album was GREAT!! Toxicity was pretty damn good, and this is just B.S.!!! What happened to the band with an edge. The band with inspiring deep lyrical content. Why are they singing about partying in the desert? Why do I feel like MTV hypnotized SOAD and convinced them they were the Backstreet Boys? I downloaded this CD to see if it was worth buying, and suprisingly it wasnt even worth the download! Well I still have the older works of a once great band to fill the void that this horrid album has left me with. WTF Happened!!!!! What the hell are these jokers thinking??GO BUY THE NEW DEVILDRIVER AT THE END OF THE MONTH 6/28/05 I believe......save your money!"
5,Unbelievable,"This is possibly the best SOAD CD. It is up there with Toxicity.Tracks (and my amazing ratings) are as follows:1. Soldier Side- 9.52. B.Y.O.B.- 9.53. Revenga- 9.04. Cigaro- 9.05. Radio/Video- 9.06. This Cocaine makes me feel like im on this songs- 6.07. Violent Pornography- 9.58. Question!- 9.59. Sad Statue- 8.510. Lost in Hollywood- 8.511. Old School Hollywood- 9.0Another great CD from an amazing band. Also, be sure to see them live sometime if you like their stuff because their live performances are even better than the recorded ones!!!!"
4,Pretty good CD.,"Definetly not the best SOAD release, but it has some tracks on here that I really enjoy listening to. (Violent Pornograpy, Old School Holywood, B>Y>O>B, Question!) Like some have said, if you dont own any SOAD CD's yet, get Toxicity before this. Overall 3.9/5."
4,System of a Down still going strong,"I may not have been with System of a Down from the beginning but I'm still a huge fan. System of a Down does not dissapoint with their new album. Though not quite as good as part 2 of the album, ""Hypnotize"", it's a great CD with tracks like 'This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song' and 'Lost in Hollywood'. 'Revenga', 'Violent Pornography', and 'Question!' are good also but get old pretty quickly. On this CD my favorite song is 'Sad Statue' and least favorite is 'Cigaro'. Not System's best CD, but still a great buy."
3,Slow down,"On toxicity S.O.A.D had a number of sick songs, but there's only a couple on this one that are sick. They go too fast in 2/3 of the songs. If they slowed down the music instead of rushing it, then this cd would be a classic. Only buy if your a hardcore fan of S.O.A.D"
5,I expected more!,Well i will start off by saying that this album is tight. SOAD will always find a way for something in their songs to stick to you. BUT i expected more songs and a little more of what they are use to banging out. Yes hypnotize will come out soon but when you are a fan and you know what you should expect from an album then it leaves you a little empty. But dont get me wrong this album is HEAVY and SOAD RULES!!
2,System of Who? Daron?,"Yes, Daron is a brilliant song writer and i think a musical genius, but why does he feel the need to not let any other member shine? i wonder how that convo went through with the band:Serj: Hey Daron, when we gonna get in the studio? it's been a little while since we've gotten stuff out there...Daron: Oh, uh, yeah. About that. Well, we're releasing an album. In about a week.Serj: Wha? What about the rest of-Daron: Oh, no. dont worry about it. I've got everything covered. I wrote all the tunes and made sure my guitar and whiny vocals overpower everything else on the two records that i've decided to release at separate times to insure maximum profit. Because you know how bad gas prices are these days, and sine I drive a Hummer...Serj: WTF?!?! YOU DID WHAT?!Daron: woah, easy. like i said, dont worry about it. As a matter of fact, i need your help. I need you to come into the studio tomorrow and do some backup vocals for me...I wanna hear SYSTEM OF A DOWN, NOT SYSTEM OF A DARON!"
1,Pathetic,I Have Hate This CD WHY!1. You get a mellowed out version of SOAD.2. This album only features crappy singing.3. You have rated there worst CD is good as the first album which is a classic.4. Mezmerize is not anywhere near as good as any of there other albums.5. Its good to know that SOAD can sell out there fans and get great reviews for it.6. The Lead Singer in this album is the guitarist not the lead singer. You cant understand anything that he sings.7. When the real lead singer sings he is to mellow and sounds like has crack stuck in his nose.
1,Do NOT compare this crappy band to Faith No More,"Faith No More is one of the greatest bands to ever grace this worthless planet. And to compare them to System of a Down is downright preposterous and asinine. It's like comparing William Shakespeare to Dan Brown, I mean, you just can't. So do yourself a favor and buy a Faith No More CD instead, Angel Dust to be exact, and forget this one."
2,Yo-Lady-Who?,What are these guys thinking? Are they trying to make a transition like Metallica? After listening to this album after I bought it; I realized that it dosent seem like they will be able to top their last album. Some music you shouldn't have to pay for; this is that album. My advise: DOWNLOAD it instead...
1,Should have been protesters instead of musicians!,"I'm so sick of bands using their musical status and talents to push political agendas. I used to really like these guys and put up with some of the messages because the music was sick but this album reaches a new low. The music is decent but I can only listen to someone trash my country while they make millions here for so long. I'm sure it will sell millions of copies to the sheeple in our evil capitalist nation and I'm so glad that our troops can have such an inspirational album front and center while they fight the real evil. Good morale for America, but wait where is the song that condemns the terrorists and suicide bombers, I guess that was a hidden track... maybe check a country album for that one."
1,You people have your head stuck in your......,"Anyway what happened to real music, this is just a bunch of slapped together riffs, much like all of SOAD's albums with a bunch of lyrics that 50% of the time are gibberish and metphors that dont mean anything. Go buy some real music. Nightrage, inflames, Dream Evil, Killswitch enage, Testament, King Diamond, something anything but this waste of plastic."
1,Just ... freakin ... terrible!,"Please do metal fans a favor a do not call this a metal album. It's alternative, no more no less. This band is in the same category as NIN, only not as good, and I hate NIN. I made a big mistake and bought their first two albums. Well ... buying one could be considered a mistake, but buying two ... that's just bad judgement (or stupidity). ""BYOB"" has got to be the dumbest song I have heard in a while."
3,System of a Down,I must say the tracks for this album is not bad at all.Gave it 3 stars for the following reasons:Pros-Sounds/voice are perfect if your the average system of a down fan. Sounds were wonderful!Cons-Poor Lyrics-They go way over board with political views. Way too much for me to listen to when you have family over there in the mid east fighting.
1,Horrible,"This cd Will Go Down As The Biggest Dissapointment of 2005.. This cd just flat out suxks.. there are 3 good songs BYOB, CIGARO AND Violent PORNOGRAPHY thats it.. i will surely not be buying Hypotize in the fall.."
2,Give me a break...,"System of a Down are unique... yes. They have some heavy riffs... yes. Is it worth my time to listen to 40 minutes of political BS?... After a couple of listens to this new album I am thinking NO!!! How many times do I have to listen to rambling crap about genocice?? Plus Daron Malakian needs to learn that he is a good guitar player, but a horrible singer. Come on, he sounds like a cat with his balls caught in a trap! I would shelf this album and buy a real metal CD like BLS, Lamb of God, or Shadows Fall."
1,Pseudo gibberish passing as astute socio- political commentary,"My title sums up what I think of this album. Cheap, emotionally charged non- sensical lyrics designed to score points with pseudo intellectuals who will try and give meaning to the nonsense. Some of the riffs are great, but they never have a chance to develop into something greater, giving the music a disjointed feel. A particularly unsatisfying release..."
1,Even the name is lame...,"These guys are a sorry excuse for a metal band. The popularity of them alone says the days of good metal(Soulfly, Sepultura, Slayer, etc) are quickly coming to an end and we begin the age of bubble-gum rock. I can sing in the shower (and have) better than the ""singer"" of this group. ""Fingernails on chalkboard"" would have been a more appropriate name for these guys. BYOB is the song getting the most radio play, AND IT'S TERRIBLE!! Beer, Bombs, whatever the B stands for, really stands for ZERO! These guys are WAY to late to ride the idealic coatails of Rage against the machine. A sub-par band for sub-par times..."
2,Will an instrumental version be made available?,I was wondering why this CD was on Sale for $8.99 at my local Circuit City. 3 solid tracks (Serj saves the day). 8 others to fall asleep to. Daron's vocals are so bad that even studio gods Rick Rubin and Andy Wallace could not save this ship from sinking. I would give this CD four stars if there were no vocals. Seriously folks. If you want to hear someone being castrated. This is the CD for you.
2,worst album yet,"Not mezmerized at all with this album. Besides the standout single, BYOB, and a few other tracks, namely, Cigaro, Radio/Video, Question & Sad Statue, the rest of the songs are throw-aways. That's 5/11 tracks, people, not even half the album is worth the price of admission!!It makes me sick to listen to what people have to say about this very bland album and I can't believe that people are actually dishing out between $12-$15 to buy this thing when it's only 32 minutes long. This album is ZERO compared to Toxicity and old System songs which have stood the true test of time. Don't waste your time buying this album for a few songs just to make SOAD richer than they already are!!"
2,Not Mesmerized,"I was really excited about the new System of a Down album when I heard it was coming out, and when I got it I was really disappointed. I listened to it over and over thinking I would eventually get into the CD but I couldn't. The CD does have some decent tracks. Not great but decent. Compared to the previous System of a Down albums this one is crap. If I could get my money back I would."
5,Radio can go to hell,"At first listen, you might expect to be confused about where these guys are going with their music. The lyrics are indeed very repetitive, but listen to the guitars, amazing! If you actually listen to the whole cd, you understand what SOAD is doing. They are taking songs you may hear on the radio and saying, ""you guys really like whats on the radio? Sure we can do that, no problem."" And then they play a song that says, ""Eat this up! radio songs are easy and we are going to blow everyone on the radio away with our sound."" They are fighting the radio in their own way. And for that, I have to give them 5 stars."
4,Middleground between SOAD and Toxicity,"Soldiers Side-3/5.Rather slow for my taste.BYOB-4/5.Nice single that feels like a Toxicity cut.Cigaro-5/5.Fast,pounding track with great chorus.Revenge-4/5.Melodic metal.Radio/Video-3/5.Pretty repetitive attack on mainstream music.This coke make sme feel like im on this song-4/5.Confusing song with Serj's great Biafra impression.Violent Pornography-5/5.Unrelenting riff with great chorusSad Statue-3/5.Completely average and normal,witch you should never have to say about SOAD.Question-3/5.Very similar to Ddevil from SOAD.Old School Hollywood-4/5.Metal Beatlesque sung by Daron with chorus by Serj.Lost in Hollywood-2.5/5.Overrated,slow jam."
3,Finnaly a New Album.... It's ok...not to good....not terrible,A bunch of peeps are saying that this album sucks cuz u can't understand what they are saying. Since when could you understand what system of a down was saying in ANy of their albums... Besides none of their songs ever make sense... the bad thing about system of a down is that they just use words that rhyme their songs don't mean anything... For this album itself its just plain weird. I liked Steal this album! and Toxicity better... (i haven't been able to buy the first one unfortunaly):(
5,Great Album,"I haven't heard anything this good since Toxicity. Though Toxicity is their best album, this album is easily their second best album. The songs on here are great. B.Y.O.B. is my favorite on this album. Sad Statue and Revenga are other great songs. I think Cigaro is one of their funnyest song. At first when I heard this song I couldn't believe what they had just said. But after a few more listens i got used to this song and thought it was very funny everytime. I love how SOAD makes every song on each album count. Out of all the SOAD albums before this one there aren't really any bad songs. This album is no different all the songs are great. This is highly recommended. Buy this album."
4,very NOT bad.,"im not a huge SOAD fan. i recorded their first album from a friend after i heard ""spiders"" and then i heard a few off Toxicity and went and got it....LOVED IT!!! when ""Steal This Ablum"" came out i didnt go get it because i wasnt a huge fan, i still havent heard it to this day. then i started hearing Cigaro and BYOB on the internet a few months ago and fell in love with both songs, so i knew i had to get this new one. Well, it came out today and although i still havent gotten a chance ot hear it all (i will tonight after work) i have heard maybe 4 songs off of it and i dig 'em. so since i cant go thru all the songs, i will say that i can tell already that it is a great album. a lot of SOAD fans bitch and complain about their political views, and you know what? i could care less, i couldnt give a frogs fat ass who they hate, love, support or dont support, i dig SOAD for their music and their sound. although i think Toxicity might be alittle better, this album rocks!!!"
3,Too much filler...,"If you are a fan of System of a Down, you know what kind of music they churn out. If not, they are often considered alternative. Today that word could mean anything. There is a mix of metal, screamo, and twisted lyrics that create their music. Most of the time, this works very well.This CD features a lot of anti-war music. They do it in a way that's just not talking bad about the United States though, they do it through decent music. Not all the songs are anti-war though. So if you are looking for just some good music without the message, it has that as well.The CD however featured far too many filler songs. Some songs like B.Y.O.B. and Sad Statue were great, while other songs just seemed like something they threw in to fill up space. I would suggest listening toToxicityorHypnotizeif you want a more complete System of a Down experience."

3,small light duty tool kit,"Smaller than I had anticipated, but quite complete and inexpensive. Good for college bound student with light duty compact needs."
4,Great Gift for a UT Fan,My friend is a UT alum and rabid fan. I got her this game for Christmas and she loves it. Says it makes her want to go back to Austin.
2,"More ""motivation"" than ""organization system""","My title says it all. There isn't much of a blue print laid out here for you to follow on the path to organizing your life. For the most part, this book seems to beat around the bush by presenting you with a series of actual accounts of clutterers and discussion on why you hoard things and how much better your life would be if you didn't. The author frequently sites his own experience as a reformed pack rat. After reading this book, I felt more pumped up to take action than instructed on how to go about better organizing the different facets of my life. True, motivation is half the battle, but I would have preferred more guidance with the other half."
1,Doesnt' deliver on its promise,"I was very disappointed with this book. It began well, with humorous antedotes of cross-country travels with spare-parts-cars. However, the actual clutter-cleaning content is minimal at best, the bulk of the book is a recommendation for clutters annoymous, with memoirs from reformed clutters. I learned there is a DSMV diagonsis of ""hoarding."" And that's the sum total of the value afforded my reading investment. There was no substantive information to be gained on how to avoid and/or clear clutter. A look on ehow.com for how to clean a closet gave me more valuable information than did this book. PS Dear Amazon: This one will be coming back."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Many books have been written about how to organize your life, your workspace and your home, some good, some bad. We gravitate toward authors that provide practical systems for bringing order to debilitating chaos. This is not one of those books. Mike Nelson instead writes of the psychological reasons that some people allow clutter to overtake their lives. If you're looking for an explanation about why you can't find that important file, start reading. If you're looking for some way to prevent you from making similar mistakes in the future, we [...] advise you to look elsewhere."
1,don't buy it as a how to,"This book is fine for those who want to understand why they clutter, but not for those who want to know how to control it. Lots of empathy/sympathy, but I wouldn't buy it if I were looking for specific techniques."
5,Celluloid Black and White Heaven,"Watch this film and you are immediately one up!! Unlike poor Palfrey played by the wonderfully unassuming Ian Carmichael. If you are feeling down and want a story with a happy ending, thats romantic without being too sloppy, funny without being crudely slapstick and innocent but with a gleam in its eye, then this is the film for you. As ever the performances of Alastair Simm, Terry Thomas, Carmichael and the rest of the cast end up overshadowing the never-the-less delightful plot. Actors of this calibre from this period always seem not to be acting if you know what I mean. This gives the viewer such empathy with their plight that one becomes engrossed totally, squirming with Palfreys plight and chuckling at the Professors ploys and cheering when the baddy gets his and Palfrey gets the beautiful April.Please watch this fim but try not to take the wrong message from it! Remember that finally Palfrey has to open his heart to get the girl. Enjoy."
5,wonderful literature about real music,Here you find a accessible explanation about basic but unknow concepts of learning music. Its worth read each page with atention.
2,Chips easily?,"As soon as this pot came I was happy and ready to make chicken noodle soup,but there was a chip of white stuff missing. A big enough chip in the bottom to make me rethink owning this pot. If it chips this easily in shipping, will it chip this easy through normal usage? The size was just right and it was pretty, but pretty isn't going to hold up to time. We all know that enameled beauty wears easily and becomes ugly with time. So I can not give this pot a thumbs up. Why is the only tag available recommended? I would not recommend this product BUT AMAZON was excellent to work with in the return of the product and a refund. I recommend AMAZON."
2,Large Chip in Bottom,Pot is unusable for its intended task thanks to the finish coming off on the inside.
2,A delta product that does not fit delta products!,This is was prescribed as a replacement for the horizontal rod for a older 25902 faucet. This was what the manufacturer recommended as a replacement. However it does to fit. The clip does not attach to the clevis. The metal projection to hold the stopper is not the right length. This new version has a plastic cap. Which is a better design but the wrong length. The one that would fit is the Price and Pfister which is listed on this page. So a non Delta product will work for the Delta product. Otherwise purchase the whole pop up assembly. That is an rp62472.
2,Scratched,It had more scratches than were admitted to in the description I read. I will order more cautiously in the future.
5,Hymns of Faith: Songs of Inspiration,I love Sandi Patty. As for the cd when I first got it. It wouldn't play after the first song. I have a cd repair kit and tried that. Now it works fine.
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this CD thinking it was going to be a fresh new Sandi from the 80's but I was mistaken. She already had recorded most of the songs but with little difference here. Her crystal high notes seem somewhat dull now. Not as high or crisp as before. The song, The Prayer didn't quite work this time around. The Charlette Church and Josh Groban version was better. It seemed that Patti and her husband did not blend too well as a duo. The Star Spangled Banner newer version is not as powerful as when she first sang it. The song, Shout To the Lord was also off somewhat. This song did not go well with Sandi soprano voice."
5,Works good,Its a little unstable and a little short; but that's the price for portability. I have sat in a soft tilled corn field for about 2 hours and I never sank in or fell over. I carry this in my day pack whenever I go to rally races and I am always glad that I have it.
4,Great Buy,"I highly recommend this stool. Folded, it's about the size and weight of a medium sized umbrella. It's not the most stable chair but it a great buy"
2,"Folds compact, difficult to setup, wobbly","This stool folds very compact and has a nice bag for storage. Stretching the seat to snap in place between the arms is difficult, and I have resorted to getting it lined up on the floor and stepping on it to get it to stretch that last bit and pop in place. With use it may stretch out a bit and get easier.The legs do not lock in the open position, and it can get very tipsy very quickly if they are not spread all the way. Leaning to the sides also causes the arms to flex around, leaving you to wonder if it is going come apart (it never did).It is a clever design but probably left best for temporary use, like when you need an extra seat in the camper to accommodate guests."
3,Difficult to set up,"I bought 2 of these for my parents. One was somewhat easy to set up and the other was extremely difficult to set up. The seat piece was too small and was hard to reach black bar in notch to lock in. It was even more difficult to break down. I was gonna send it back, but the instructions say this is normal and it will eventually stretch out."
2,"whoops, down I go again","Having finished a 4 day backpacking trip with 2 of these stools the results are 1 stool still existing and 7 falls. We had 2 families on the trip and 4 types of stools. Though this stool was compact and lightweight, it was very fragile and difficult to balance on. The 15 year old boy was able to catch himself before falling from this stool, but 3 adults found themselves on the ground frequently. One finally snapped in half while someone was sitting in it. Recommended only for very small or lightweight people (under 125 lbs.)to use as a light, short term seating where you conciously use your legs to stay balanced."
5,Perfection all around,"These are so perfect. First of all they pack light and small. We are going to use them for the Telluride Jazz Festival 2012. They will be foot stools and then hold our food for lunch. We will also take them hiking/camping. I hadn't thought about seating but these make it possible. I weigh 218 and am 6'2"". I sat on one one just fine. No tilting or sliding. They need to be used on about 1 square foot of level ground. They are totally awesome and perfect in every way for what they are."
5,camp stool,"I bought this stool because I have a hip that needs relief from pain after prolonged walking. This stool allows me to continue walking my 9 holes of golf, because it easily hangs from the handle of my push cart. The short time I rest my hip by sitting while the rest of my group hits their shots alleviates the pain."
5,perfect size,"Every year my husband goes to cub scout day camp with my son and every year he comes back and says ""I wish I had a small fold up stool"". So for father's day I got him this one. He said it worked great and it folds up so small he fit it into the pocket of his hydration backpack so he was hands free walking around day camp. My husband said it was easy to open and close and nice and light weight. He said it was perfect for what he needed."
4,A Big Music Fanatic,"This was an amazing album by an amazing artist that would've dazzled the world with his great musical ability, if it wasnt for that his tragic death!The song Mi Historia Entre Tus Dedos is a great ballad with lyrics that any couple can relate to. This is album is definetely a keeper."
1,Uno de los peores discos que he escuchado,"Que horror! Al senor no se le entiende nada cuando canta en espanol. Todas las canciones son iguales. La unica que se salva es ""Mi historia entre tus dedos"". Definitivamente dinero tirado a la basura...."
5,aah!,"i find that there is nothing sexier than gianluca's emotional deliverance of his thought-provoking songs, especially ""ci vuoi tornare con me"". give me gianluca's CD, a glass of wine, and i'm set to go."
3,much better in Italian!,I simply adore Gianluca Grignani and I have every single CD but not this one. I used to own it. The Italian version is far far superior even down to his Curt Cobain screams done in tasteful Italiano! The Italian version is EXQUISITE; I do not know either language.
5,But why the new Revised Edition,"The Second Edition of the OCD was published in 1970; the Third Edition was published in 1996. Now we have the Third Edition Revised published in 2003. So why the revision of the third edition? No one seems to be able to answer that. If there were mistakes made in the 1996 edition why is it still for sale? Don't get me wrong I have used the OCD for about 30 years and it is a great tool, but it makes one wonder why the revision? Research in the Classics is moving at such a pace to warrant a revision. So as one who has all three I feel a little cheated by the Oxford University Press."
3,A resource Book for A Classics Scholar,"I purchased this book, with the hope that it would help me understand more about persons and other topics I was reading about in my Latin course.Although I can see this books virtues, I did not find it helpful for my purposes.The typeface is very small, a real drawback for a far-sighted person.I discovered that I could find answers to my questiions with recourse to far less scholarly works than this.Undoubtedly, this work is a treasure for a classics scholar. I am not one of these.I traded it in in excellent condition."
4,Oxford Classical Dictionary - Review,"After returning the faulty bound copy, the second one we received appears ok. Thanks DWB"
5,Indespensible!!,"As a 1st. year Master's degree student studying ancient Mediterranean civilizations I can not believe I made it this far without the book on my shelf. Ok, so I used a library copy. Now that I have my own I find myself using it more and more. I even find myself causualy flipping through the pages as I eat dinner. I am constantly amazed at the wealth of information provided. This is a ""must have"" volume for anyone with more than just a passing interest in the classics. It may at fist appear a bit expensive but it is worth every dollar, drachma, denari, whatever. I will admit that this is the only 'dictionary' I actually sit down and read, albeit slowly. The volume of entries, their content, and clarity are without equal. A wonderful added bonus is the inclusion of references to further reading and research. For those of us actively studying classical civilizations this is an indespensible aid to scholarly research."
5,I lucked out.,I actually bought my copy of the book at a conference I was at last week right when it first came out. I'm glad I did because Iknow some friends of mine have tried buying it now and it seems like a lot of places have sold out their books already. I read almost the whole book on my plane ride home. This worked really well becaue I was able to figure out the hacks I really wanted to do and then go through them following all of the steps once I got home. I then spent pretty much the whole weekend in my workshop.
5,DON'T GIVE APPLE ANY MORE OF YOUR $$$$,"I was so [mad] at Apple for their iPod battery replacement policy, that I decided to replace it myself. You can get the batteries cheap from lots of different places. I'm pretty good at tinkering with things but I was worried that I might really do damage to my iPod. I was totally psyched when i saw this book covered how to replace the battery on your own. I had found a couple of pretty cheesy things on the internet, but nothing like this. The photos are really detailed and professional looking and the instructions are incredibly clear. I got the book just for the battery thing, but there's lots of other very cool stuff for the iPod in there. I've also now build my own home theater PC system using a lot of the info. from this book."
3,"good, but not for everyone","The title is somewhat misleading since theres a fair amount of console repairing information here. The actual hacking information ranges from simple controller rewiring to completely gutting a pc. The chapters done by the main author are very indepth and maybe out of reach of some but the author knows his subject. The chapters concerning the Atari systems though are quite the opposite. All the information presented has already been published by others before or has been available online for free for years, and the author seems more concerned about promoting his website and selling homemade games. Overall there isn't much information here that is new to justify the price but it's a nice compilation with plenty of nice pictures."
3,Great Music - Awful Quality,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Kenny Wheeler fan and an avid collector of his records. Plus, the music on this recording is great; exactly what I was looking for. However, I travel a lot and spend a lot of time listening to music on headphones, and beacuse of the record quality of this (the other review says its from a radio broadcast?), I find it unbearable to listen to on headphones. Granted, I have yet to listen to the album on speakers, but so far I literally cannot go more than a minute of listening until my ears can't take it. There is this constant whooshing sound which fades between left and right and increases during random parts of the song. It is incredibly annoying and I can't get it out of my head. I'm not even usually a stickler for hi-def audio, I can listen to bootlegs and basic live recordings without a complaint. But THIS, whatever it is, I find absolutely unbearable. So if you're a stickler for hi-quality audio, or use headphones a lot, BEWARE."
4,"Thorough and Overwhelming, But Achievable","Blogging for Dummies innundates your mind with numerous options to select a blogging platform and launch your own space on the net. It's organized into manageable chunks that let you decide how to proceed with confidence.Had I read this book before I launched my blogs, I believe my frustration levels would have been much lower and success much quicker, with fewer problems. The book also reveals beneficial ideas and tools for bloggers, whether new or at the veteran stage.Chapter 8, The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging, is the only chapter I found more confusing than necessary. While blogging is already a daunting process for some, it needn't be complicated by the technical instructions explained here.The topics of Real Simple Syndication (RSS) and money-making options provide a well-rounded look at this subject.Stay with the book's basic strategies for fast and easy setup, and you'll be blogging in no time."
4,"Excellent book to get started, well worth buying!","Blogging for Dummies by Brad Hill is a terrific resource for new to moderate bloggers. I've been blogging for almost six months, but I learned an enormous amount of information from Hill's book. His writing is irreverent and witty and full of what you need to know to really make your blog stand out from the crowd. I still have to figure out how to shrink a picture to 50k, but once I get that down, there'll be no stopping me! The book covers Blogger.com, TypePad, Yahoo360, MSN, and several other sites in detail so a new user can jump write in and get a great site going. His instructions are basic and easy to follow, and he addresses the pros and cons of each site well with pictured examples. It had great info for me to get moving, but I think I'll end up purchasing this book, because he has a great deal of info inside for more experienced bloggers who want more control over their sites."
2,too many jokes hide the info,"I know there's good information here...somewhere...but everytime my eye lights on a page I have to find my way around the author's witicisms to get the information. And I haven't laughed once. If they want it to be funny and engrossing, they should get Dave Barry to write it. Otherwise, it's just annoying."
2,Waste of money,"As a beginning blogger, I was disappointed with this book. I generally like the Dummies series and have found them useful and entertaining. This one is not. The author is sarcastic -p. 3 ""What You're Not to Read - I forbid you to read trashy novels from the supermarket."" Really! The information on Blogger doesn't add anything that can't be found on Blogger help screens. Several blogging services, for example Edublog, are not mentioned at all. Last, The Part of Tens was not as neat as in most of the Dummies books. I want my money back!"
2,Not good or deep enough,"I have already put my comments into Blad's blog. The book, though well written, is too shallow. This is a pity as blogging could be very effective. Instead of telling us how to do the simplest of thing, which we could pick up in a few minutes in front of a PC, a deeper exploration of how to effecitvely use blogs would have really helped.Brad makes a big deal out of using photos in Wordpress. I found it straightforward: all I did was upload the photo and drag it into the post box, thus having it in both open boxes. Although I did not expect a lot out of this book, I did expect a little more. Loks like I will have to put this book on the shelf and spend time trawling Wordpress information sites. This defeats the purpose of buying the book."
2,I'm not this dumb,"This book provides a very basic overview of blogging for someone who has very little knowledge. It does not really tell you how to do it and provides very little information about how to use the any of the available software. On the other hand, it gives a lot of information about relatively esoteric functions such as RSS syndication, trackback links, audioblogging, etc. It does not offer a consistent approach to the subject but seems to go where the author's interests take him."
3,"Love the kimonos, wish there was more info","You have to hand it to Tom Tierney, his descriptions and the information he offers on his paper dolls are first class. Ming-Ju Sun has made really lovely paper dolls, and if I just wanted some paper dolls I'd be very happy. But I also want to find out about the fabrics and layers and traditional fabrics for the season..."
5,GET THIS BOOK!,"This sums things up so well -- not only for physiology, but for biochemistry areas as well. A must have, I believe, for medical school."
4,Great USMLE physiology review,The book is excellent because it presents physiology in a very straight forward and uncomplicated manner.The contents and emphasis is more than enough for USMLE though First Aid says that it is slightly weak in respiratory and Acid Base physiology .I found both to be adequate and Renal physiology particularly enjoyable.The book assumes that you have reasonably good basics to follow its outline format and the books relative lack of explanations. But if you had once learned and enjoyed physiology you will enjoy this book a lot and go through it fast.It may not be useful with the course work as different institutions present material in a different way and a review book without much explanation and a possible different approach may be confusing. Perhaps reading STARS Physiology book( I havent checked it) with the course and then using the review for the USMLE could be helpful.Best of luck with the exams.
3,It could be improved,"If the holes on the sides were bigger, it would give the user a lot more flexibility. The top holes don't match a regular standard rack."
4,Definitely a worthy book for developers and security pros alike,"Hacking the Code is a must read if you want to pick apart .NET Web applications in the name of better security. More people in development and IT need to read books like this. I like how it focuses on ASP.NET - the language that a large portion of Web applications are developed in today. The book covers the important areas of securing applications and shows some good examples. Appendix A also has some good ASP.NET code samples for real-world concerns.I especially like the coverage on authentication mechanisms which is something that's often taken for granted by developers but where I tend to find a lot of the weaknesses in the work I do. Plus it doesn't just focus on the technical side of things with the coverage of users awareness and policies. Overall, very good at covering the root of many of our security problems."
1,Oregon On My Mind,Well really don't know much about the book being I have had 50 on order since April and still don't have all of them. Trickle in maybe 2 or more at a time. Really don't like how you have no information on when this product will be in.I think your CS needs work
4,Pump necessary,After I purchased the tank I attempted to fill a generator. I was told that the 225 pound tank (when full) needs to be higher than where its going into. I needed to purchase an additional pump for about $150.00. Great quality otherwise.
2,didn't come with hose,I have yet to try it as it didn't ship with a hose. Really??? How do you ship this without a hose?
5,Highly Recommend,The only people who won't like this book are fans of Bill Gates. The most dead-on book about geek culture so far.
1,Extremely disappointing.,"Like a previous reviewer wrote, not one laugh in the book. Unfunny, immature, un-clever, and practically unreadable due to the typeface selection. What the heck was the ""Geek IQ units"" about... that went nowhere. Drawings were also incredible ugly. A complete waste of my money, I'm trying not to remember this book."
2,"Ouch. 200+ pages, not 1 laugh.","Not so funny. Maybe my grandparents would think it was cute? I sure didn't.At least it has a cool cover, and an interesting title..."
5,Amazing but true!,I picked up Mean Justice after seeing the recent rave review in the San Francisco Chronicle. What a story! It was the best page turner I've read in a while.
1,One-sided view of Kern County,"Humes hopes that we will accept this book as the final word on justice in Kern County, but it is not. A rebuttal has been posted on the District Attorney's Web page. The rebuttal, Humes writes, ""failed to respond directly to most key issues raised in the book."" (paperback, page 510)This is untrue, because the rebuttal actually addresses all of Humes' important points, and rebuts many errors. It is a shame that Humes avoids any further discussion. On the book's own Web page, with more than eighty links, there is no reference, and no link, to the rebuttal.I read this book hoping for scholarship, but it turned out to be issue advocacy, and pretty sloppy advocacy at that. Prosecutorial misconduct is a major issue, an issue that deserves a better book than this."
1,Criminals Unite!!!,"Finally, a book where all of Kern County's criminals can gather around and bemoan ""unique"" tales of ""injustice."" Everyone knows that the State prisons are full of ""innocent"" men and women. I cannot tell you how many times I have heard how convicted felons were ""wrongfully"" accused and/or prosecuted. However, just because people do not want to accept the consequences of their criminal conduct does not mean this book is either true or accurate. Just because one of the leading characters, Patrick Dunn, a convicted murderer, would rather get out of prison, does not make this book true or accurate. I, for one, like it when convicted criminals are behind bars; it makes me feel safe. This book does an injustice to the community of Bakersfield by creating a false sense of hysteria where none exists. It just seems ironic, though not at all surprising, that this book would find support from Kern County's convicted and admitted criminals; dare I say only the ""innocent"" convicted crimiunals?"
1,"Good story, but not a good book",This could have been a good book if the private investigator (Laura Lawhon?) had written it. I found it to be very repetitive. I also did not care to read about all the other cases. I wish it would have had pictures (most true crime books do)--it makes it more interesting to see who I'm reading about.
3,Kraan 1983...,"I have to agree with the other reviewer. If the late seventies were the era that killed progressive, then the early eighties (with the advent of the Neue Deutsche Welle, sort of the German new-wave explosion) sent more German bands into relative obscurity. To avoid this, Kraan tried to experiment with different song structures (and at one point, drum machines). The music is still timeless as ever, but the subject matter give the album a dated quality, which happens to often when you use political lyrics."
3,LCD Not Working,"I JUST STARTED USING THIS PHONE ON JAN. 9, 2006. MY LCD ONLY WORKS WHEN I PICK UP THE RECEIVER. I HAVE FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS AND REPLACED MY NEW BATTERIES WITH MORE NEW BATTERIES. I CHECKED WITH 2 OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PHONE, AND THEY HAVE THE SAME ISSUES. THE SPEAKER WHINES REALLY, REALLY LOUDLY, SO I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT ALSO. I WOULD REALLY LIKE THIS SLEEK PHONE, IF NOT FOR THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES."
1,It's a great disposal phone!!!,"I bought this phone because of the ""great specs""; calculator, calendar, clock, speaker, caller id, it got it all. It worked great for about 8 months and now I can hardly dial out. The numbers in the middle section (2, 5, 8, and 0) are completely dysfunctional, so the calculator won't work either. Dialing out is a real nightmare; the keys get either stuck, dial doubles, or simply don't work. It takes at least 10 tries to just dial a number. So buy this phone only if you like to change systems every year, if you ONLY receive calls, or just don't need to dial 2, 5, 8 or 0. I know...it's only a $10 bucks' phone!!!"
3,"Nice frame, but sound feature is worthless.","It is a very nice, heavy frame, but the sound quality is horrible. Not worth it."
2,My expectations were higher.,"I had searched the internet for an item that could help my parents and I relive a great childhood memory. It required something that could record a section of a song for playback. This item worked unfortunately the sound quality is not the best. I tried to record it from 3 different sources and various distances. I even tested just my voice, but the items speaker caused huge vibrations or could not be heard. The company that sent it was great they offered to take it back and refund my money. However I can not just go to my parents and take back one of their christmas gifts that has a sentimental value to them even though it could have worked better."
4,talking pic frame great audio!,Excellent gift for a grandparent! Our Dad loved it! the Grandkids voices recorded real well! Good product for the $$$$
3,Beautiful frame - very poor audio,The is a beautiful super shiny silver frame. The recording instructions are easy but the sound quality is terrible. The audio is very garbled. I tried several times to record but to no avail. I had used a recordable frame from Radio Shack several years ago and the sound quality was awesome. This frame is prettier than that one though.
2,geschilderd!!! an ogrepoets Ruprecht turdKnech!!!,"the revenesent raddish said rather much all that concerning this book must be said. the style is the largest problem, which is followed by the tales. a work shouldn't transport you; and there are a fine line between the succulent and overstuffed prose of Turkey. downriver a breaking loose bird is. record this- if some obscure work is constructed as above/below, being the great book nobody's never read of, it are of some critics who try to pull one of the left field simply to print another one for each other. (and they had probably never read it in any way, too much a disturbance)...never forget that the work for a reason was desperately incomprehensible. dumme Dichters."
1,dissappointed,I liked the design. It comes in 3 parts and the middle part is plastic! For $155I expected solid quality all around. Returning to Amazon was easy -- great customer service!
5,Finally!,"Finally a realistic book about stress with biblical principles on how to manage it! As Christians, we are often in denial about stress because we think we are not walking in faith if we have stress. I am so grateful with how Dr. Mendes first explains what stress is, then how to assess the stress in our lives, and finally how to manage it. The ten principles she recommends to avoid, reduce, or manage stress are simple yet profound, and very doable. Thank you Dr. Mendes! Christian or not, anyone can benefit from this book!"
5,Pico de Gallo is the best song ever!,"I'm 16 years old, don't have kids, didn't grow up on the music, but I love it! My sophmore English teacher sang Pico de Gallo on May 5 for us, and I have been hooked ever since! Pico de Gallo is my favorite song ever! If you have never heard these guys, you don't know what you are missing!"
4,Great for Parents too!,"This CD is perfect for the whole family. It has witty, silly lyrics that are equaling pleasing to the parent as well as to the kids. There is some clever word play that is good for young, developing minds too."
4,Big Trouble is great,"My favorite is still Family Party, but that's probably because I've had it for years--I bought it even before my son was born. We enjoy Big Trouble, we just have to listen to it more often to really get to know the songs. We especially like the title song--that poor kid, in such big trouble because the monsters have wrecked his house!"
5,Big Trouble,"This CD is for anyone who has kids and is totally sick of the standard kid stuff. We have owned this CD for 5 years and still are not tired of listening to it! All the songs will remind you of situations you had as a child, ie. Big Trouble, on how to explain why the house is all torn up after the parents have been out for the day. Other titles will have you amazed at Ezra and Keith's musical abilities and kid-like imaginations! Buy this and you will love it!"
5,Terrific music for kids (age 4 up) AND adults--very rare!,"This is one of the best collections of music for kids I've ever come across. And it's satisfyingly sophisticated enough for adults. Music is lively, varied, fun. Lyrics are funny and wonderful. It's a collection to listen to over and over--a real delight!"
5,Excellent,"My first piece of the Carnival Village and I cant wait to set this up. THe seller has alot of good looking products which I wll be purchsing on a monthly basis. packed well and deliverd on time, good seller"
5,Amazing Debut Album,"This is an amazing debut CD. For those of you are unware of this, she is the daughter of Billie Joel. She has gotten her songwriting and musical ability from her dad. I was very impressed with her lyrics and voice. When singing ""Song of Yesterday"" she makes me think a little of Nora Jones but better. This is keeper for your music collection."
1,Awful,"This album is very amateurish and Alexa Ray Joel's voice is a screechy mess. If it weren't for her dad Billy Joel's money helping her out, she wouldn't even be able to get her career going anywhere because she has no talent."
2,Not really for beginners at all,"The book is laid out in the typical ""Idiot's Guide"" fasion, with big fonts, lots of bullets and often simplistic writing style. I appreciate that...that's what you want when you pick up an idiot's guide.The title would imply that this is a book for the first time buyer of a business, or the first time seller. However, A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE is dedicated to the current business owner looking to expand by buying a new business to add to their holdings. It even touches on huge corporations buying businesses. I told myself I would skip over those parts, as I do not currently own a business. I ended up skipping darn near half the book.I'm not saying its a terrible book. It's easy to follow. But it is NOT REALLY FOR IDIOT'S. Afterall, if you're successful enough in your business to be considering buying another business, would you really want or need a book for ""idiots?"""
4,All You Need to Know Quickly,"I'll be leading a class on Exiting Your Business Stage Right: Is It Time to Go for a trade show in January. Despite what I already know, I like to back up my presentation with facts and make recommendations of books, entrepreneurial magazines, etc. This book, like all the IDGs, presents materials to you fast, succinctly and with broad range. Obviously, more digging and work is needed by the reader if they're truly serious about selling their business, but this book is a good starting point."
2,A Poor History Lesson,"It's an audio Biography on the history of Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails up until shortly after The Fragile record. 57 minutes long, we are rarely ever given any short interview segments from Reznor and none of which are necessarily important. I guess I was lucky as I got this for the low price of 2 dollars. I'm glad that I got it for that low of a price as there was no way I would have picked this up otherwise. The only good thing about it really, is the tiny poster and the fact that they do give a lot of history about Reznor, its just that the British woman's voice gets really, really boring and difficult to listen to for the entire 57 minutes especially when someone such as myself has ADD. If you do want this then by no means, pay full price for this thing."
2,You've heard it all before,It gives you a background to Trent's life . That's all very well and good but I have heard it all a million times . Still if you want some posters of Trent then buy it but otherwise don't bother . You're not going to be entertained .
2,just anoher interview disc,"First off there are a million of these out already. no ned to waste your money, all you need to do is go on the internet and check out one of the 10,000 web sited devoted to Reznor and you will find all the information you need on the band. However, if you are a die hard NIN fan then i guess this album is worth having, but god, look at the price! For an interview disc? if you really need this title wait about a month and download it from napster."
1,Where is John Mayall?,"This book purports to be a biography of the father of the British blues John Mayall. Mayall is introduced after about the first hundred pages and even then there is scant reference to any personal data about the man, his early influences and everything one would expect in a biography. The author focuses more on the evolving British blues scenes and Mayall's proteges (Clapton, Green) then he does on Mayall. I suspected that the author never talked to Mayall and this was confirmed when I asked Mayall after one of his recent shows to sign the book. He graciously declined, stating that the book was unauthorized and the author never interviewed him. Mayall also said he would be penning his autobiography so pass up this turkey and wait for the real McCoy."
2,Won't Stay Put,I have a ceramic sink and find the suction cups don't work sufficiently. It would be much more efficient had it been made with larger suction cups or with a material that reacts more like rubber than plastic.
3,rubbermaid sink divider,"Nice divider, unfortunately it does not stick very well to my Kohler stainless steel sink. The suction cups need to be bigger then maybe it would stick better. It does stay in place most of the time and has prevented some of those unwanted scratches to my new sink."
2,Rubbermaid sink divider mat,I bought this item and within 3 weeks I threw it away because it just doesnt' stick to the mat. I even tried rubbing alcohol to get the suction to stick better. If you are looking for a good scrubber holder just stick to the cheap ones. They stick better.
3,Still waiting for a better product,"I bought this product because it was the only black protector I could find for my sink. I like black because white and clear look dirty after awhile. The black has stayed clean looking since I bought it.However, I agree with the other purchasers. The protector is too small. I think it must have been made for small sinks in foreign countries. I need one longer and rectangle shaped not saddle shaped. What were the designers thinking! At first the suckers worked, but now they stick for about 5 seconds. It's such a waste of time to try resticking the suckers each time I am at the sink. I've had mine for over a year and a half. It's probably worn, and I need to buy new ones. Hopefully, Rubbermaid will make longer lasting ones in the future.I also never use the hole, so I want the option of not having the hole on the side."
3,Sweet little movie,"This is a really sweet little movie set in a lovely scenery. Sissy Spacek is great (as always) as hitchhiker Ginger and I have to admit that I probably wouldn't have liked this movie so much if it hadn't had her in it. Anyway, it's a cute little love story, and it also has some very beautiful songs in it (written by Sissy Spacek!). Easy watching!"
3,ANOTHER MIDDLE-AGED MAN FALLS IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG WOMAN,"Joe Maroney (Monte Markham), divorced for three months, is driving in New Mexico from Albuquerque to his home in Santa Fe when he picks up a hitchhiking free spirit, Ginger Brown, played by Sissy Spacek, and the two subsequently become romantically absorbed with each other as New Year's Eve nears, whereupon Joe's former Army comrade Charley (Mark Miller) and, coincidentally, Charley's former wife Sugar (Susan Oliver) join them with many complications as the product. Hoydenish Spacek is appealing and brings life to scriptor/producer Miller's lines, but bland Markham's metabolic rate seems to be constant throughout and Oliver, a talented actress, is given loathsome dialogue and exaggerates it, without doubt to her satisfaction, while the direction is listless and the screenplay lacks imagination, with only Spacek's reactions, although not always precisely matching her circumstances, shining through this frippery."
2,"I Love Sissy, but...","I am a great fan of Sissy Spacek but I found this movie to be a disappointment. The idea behind the movie is nothing new but with Sissy, I thought it would be special. Markham is terrible, so unconvincing, the dialogue is bland and the introduction of Markham's friend is nothing more than a diversion from what should have been more development of the relationship between Sissy and Markham, I guess the writers didn't know how to handle that. Sissy is, as always, a delight to watch and with better support from a co-star and better dialogue, her performance would have been much better. She had to have known she was trying to carry a lame story all by herself. The ending was pure Hollywood sappiness. Why in the world would anyone think the 2 of them would make it as a couple?"
2,Ginger in the Morning equals sleep at night!,"A dull movie with little meaning and point. I am sort of disappointed in Sissy for this role. She is usually seen with her acting top-notch and performances at their peak. But, in this low-entertainment feature she seems listless and sort of, well, bored with her part.Spacek stars in GINGER IN THE MORNING as part of a very slim cast. A hitchhiker (Spacek) is picked up by a buisinessman (Monte Markham) and they fall for each other. In fact, Spacek falls for his drunken friend at one point.This movie lacks energy, pace, and an interesting plot. I would recommend this film only to those who are absolutely obsessed with Sissy Spacek (or any other of the characters) or those who just want to kill time, or money.On the brief pro side, the music is fairly listenable...for the most part..."
3,3 an a half stars...,well to say everything an anything az09...covers it but technically thumbs 3an a half stars as compared to errol flynn classic never say good buy ...seems on a similar parr nice ending slightly unfaired but who cared ...doing a magnamic study in comparison male an a female acting stoogeologized somewhat systematically theatricalized shdfh....ks...
2,Bland At Best...,"This movie is like spending time with four people you're not really crazy about, but you're stuck with them for the time being, & can't wait to get away. A middle aged man (with a nice chest) going through a mid-life crisis, a hippy/free spirit, a loud, obnoxious boozehound/blowhard, & an annoying housewife (circa early 1970's). The film contains some simple yet enjoyable music from Sissy Spacek pre-""Coal Miner's Daughter""."
2,Attitude counts,"Maybe it is just me, but I found the author's attitude to be so negative as to negate some of the information. I have a severe case of sarcoidosis and am going through the steroid and now a low dose chemo drug therapy. It is life changing, but I am not going to let it ruin my life. I am blessed with good doctors and a wonderful support system of family and friends. I continue searching for information on this disease in a positive manner."
3,"A sarcoidosis patient, too","Lots of nice resources appear in the book and the author's story and those of his selected pen pals are frightening ""worst case"" sorts of hsitories. Unfortunately, the book is poorly written: passive, repetitive style and odd gramatical constructions distract the reader from the engaging content. Moreover, the focus on worst case scenarios and incompetent medical professionals is at great odds with my experience: I've been diagnosed with sarcoidosis twice in the past 7 years (I had a remission), each time within a month of odd chest X-rays, and each time in the absence of any symptoms whatsoever. Each time the doctors were very much on top of results and very quickly got me to specialists. Since I've never had a SINGLE symptom, the worst cases described in the book just don't speak to me, and may frighten readers unnecessarily."
2,Better than his first book,"If you have read Barr's other book, ""Me and Sarcoidosis: A Lifetime Partnership"", you already know that his grammar leaves one wondering where his ""editor"" that he speaks so highly of got her training. My guess is that it was a friend who cringed at his errors, and while this is somewhat improved, it still needs much work to flow properly.Being a sarcoidosis patient myself, I dragged through the books in hopes of learning how to deal with the disease, and how to treat it. By the time I got through this book, I was skipping lots of repetition from prior chapters.I agree that there was too much focus on the worst case. Conversely, the writer may feel that he received solace from his religious beliefs, but I felt like he tried too hard to push that while being soft on useful facts.I did think this was an improvement over the first book, as it didn't focus so much on Barr's own case, but I'm still looking for something more useful out there."
3,Underwhelming,"I bought these to replace my several pairs of Sony behind the neck headphones. I was tired of the foam wearing out on those, and these were way cheaper. As much as I'd hate to admit it, the Sony's are better. Here's why:1. Sound Quality. Sound quality is pretty poor, sounds like the band is playing in a cardboard box. Not as good as the equivalent Sony's I had.2. Comfort. Although these seem like an exact rip-off of the Sony behind the neck headphone, they are a little tighter as another reviewer said, and it clips your ears and hurts.Looks like the Sony and the Jensen behind the neck headphones are both a pain in the neck."
4,Love the informal chatty style of wrting and the recipes are pretty good too,"Chatty, warm and friendly this cookbook tells about how to cook and save money while never giving up on flavor. Most of the recipes are thrifty, especially if you live near the sea coast, as there are some frugal seafood recipes included. For me this would not be frugal as I live far from the seacoast. For someone who has cheap access to seafood the recipes will help.I love the various and ""out-of-the-box"" ideas presented for eating breakfast. And I love the traditional breakfast recipes too.This is a thoughtful book about frugal cooking that presents a different, and much needed, approach to this cooking genre.Recommend."
3,"Adequate, I guess","I really liked ""Dining on a Dime"" a lot better. Not much new info, and a lot of info I just didn't need. The recipes didn't look that great, and there weren't that many tips. Nice cover, though."
1,"If you're really frugal, don't buy this cookbook","Save your money. This cookbook is not worth your time. I love and collect cookbooks, so I was very disappointed when I began reading this rather pathetic book. I would say it is probably the worst cookbook I have ever purchased. It went immediately to our local thrift store. Maybe they will get a quarter for it."
3,Enjoyed the story,"Would have been better if the story got hotter between th e cop and the writer. I like that in mysteries. I also like my books to be 400 pages long. I like to sit and have my book for a long, long time."
3,Liking the rock groove...,"...that is, if you can get past some of the endless roll call list of every classic rocker the author has ever come across. Mr. Sullivan does seem to have quite a varied list of rock stories (some familiar, others not so) to share within his sordid r&r; tale of murder, obsession, power and desire.Is there a future book within the faux Peterson rock autobiography he references?"
3,Rock And Roll Murder is a good book for rock fans,"The author is obviously a big fan of rock music as he is in a band. Rock and roll is not a pretty place and the book is full of those references. The detective (O'Connell) and the journalist (Russo) are believable, but it helps if you're from the New York area to understand some of the things he discusses. No romantic interludes either, which might have been interesting."
5,"fantastic and exciting, Barry Gibb is on the money",I REALLY LOVED THE CONCEPT OF THIS VIDEO AND I ALSO LIKED THE FACT THAT BARRY GIBB GOT TO GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES BY USING A SWIMMING POOL AS SORT OF A TRANSPORTING MACHINE
2,Disappointing,"Outside of being rather dry and boring from a presentation perspective, the information provided is at best okay. I read the other reviews and bought the book anyway since I figured it was the NYT staff. Well the other reviews were right."
3,Good Source for Paper,"I had to write a very long paper for my school, and this book helped by giving me many supporting details"
4,Cheap and good ...,"It's hard to find a tray for steaming things made to fit your pots and pans but this does the job. However, not being a professional chef and all, I""m still trying to figure out how to really maximize this tray to steam my leftovers although I know that this isn't what it's for."
5,Can't review. You never delivered it.,I still want the 2 I ordered. You strung me along andhave never delivered to ones I ordered. I gave it a 5 sinceyou guys did not seem to want to give it a chance and delivermy order. K.
3,Good work,"Greenslade has done a great work with this CD, and the songs go perfect with the books, but I'm disappointed he doesn't sing more. Only 2 or 3 songs are vocal, the others are just instrumental. But ""The Shades of Ankh-Morpork"" is very good, and ""Stick and Bucket Dance"" rocks! I slightly miss The Hedgehos Song, but I have it on my computer... That's a song that really rocks!Good album..."
3,good for what it was but not what i expected,"there's a reason i gave this cd 3 stars. it almost feels unfair to have done so because the music is actually quite good and the recording is well done. i just feel that i was in some way mislead. considering the content of the discworld novels (of which i am a monstrously huge fan) i guess i expected this cd to be funny. if not funny, maybe a collection of rock or pop music with lyrics about the disc. don't be fooled!!! there are no words, save for an introduction. if you can get past that, however, the music is actually not bad. it's kind of orchestral, synthesizer, new-agey. in essence, background music. if there was something going on and this was in the background i'd say ""phwaar...not bad"" but who listens to background music by itself?"
2,Not worth it,"As much as I love the Discworld series, this CD was a disappointment. In two words, Theme music. I think that best was the Wizards Staff has a knob on the end but even that was over orchastrated."
2,"Only good for collectable, not very good for CD","I gave this CD 2 stars, only because I cannot in good concience give anything Diskworld only 1 star. The CD is only occasionally amusing, and only slightly even then; I got a biggger chuckle reading the title of ""A wizards staff..."" than actually listening to it. ""Stick and bucket dance"" is reasonably catchy, but the rest of the CD is an awkward blending of Electronic and Folk music, and almost entirely ""Ambient"" style background music. If you love Tangerine Dream, and old '70s psycadelic concept albums, maybe you will enjoy this, otherwise I'd expect this to be a CD you will listen to once, and put on your shelf."
1,"Shocked at what this ""professional"" suggests","I was shocked when my son told me his mother (my ex-wife) would lock him out of her room and keep the other children with her. I asked her about this thinking it couldn't be true, but she told me that the author of this ""book"" says it's a good idea so that the parent doesn't lose control of their temper and do something the parent later regrets! How about the parent gets some therapy if they can't control their emotions? She's not a bad therapist but I would NOT take her advice regarding children! Additionally this therapist had no moral issues with omitting specific records about my son to his therapist because she disagreed with two other therapists regarding my son's condition. I forwarded the information regardless and it helped tremendously, needless to say the my son's therapist was shocked at her actions and found the information to be very helpful."
2,What a waste of time!,"This is a tedious 2-volume video set of a massage workshop. The video quality lacks clarity. The angle that you view the model does not clearly demonstrate what the instructor is talking about. The instructor speaks with a heavy accent and you have to listen closely to understand him.In all the practice seems to be a bit of snake-oil medicine. The instructor encourages these organ massage treatments are most effective, if given three or four times a week. I don't know if any of my clients can afford that much time or money for this modality of treatment."
5,Walk in the shoes of Rose Smith,"The Road Taken takes you on journey through fast changing times of Rose Smith and her family. From the mysterious death of her mother, through the free-sprited lifestyles of her daughter and grandchildren. The novels goes deeply into issues such as early methods of birth control which in today's society would be consider barbaric. To the the taboos of sexualty and virginity way before the sexual revolutions of the sixties and seventies. The Road Taken is a great history lesson for poeple how would like to take it another level."
4,RONA JAFFE BECOMING A FAVORITE OF MINE,"Rona Jaffe has got me hooked! This was a well-written family saga, as we follow Rose from 10 years old to 100. A good family saga, intertwining events in our world that occurred with some affecting Rose's family.After reading The Tea Rose and The Winter Rose by Jennifer Donnelly, it was difficult to find a family-saga book I would enjoy, but this had me unable to put down. I've only read Jaffe's book ""Class Reunion"" and loved it and look forward to reading more books by this great author."
2,nothing special...,"My unhappiness with this novel comes from its rather too obvious historical/sociological research (inserted in great dollops throughout) and the shallowness of the characters. The story such as it is moves along at a steady pace but in the end does not say a great deal. It's a bit like a popular 20th century history (event after event) seen through the eyes of not very significant people. Compared with the witty, observant family-centered novels of authors like Nancy Clark, Jonathan Franzen or George Hagen, this is minor stuff, the sort of novel you buy in a remainder book shop (which is where I bought my copy) and maybe read on a plane. I won't be chasing the rest of Ms Jaffe's output. But - I paid about $4 and got about $4 worth of a novel."
5,Doesn't Get Better Than This...,"After reading just 2 of her books, Rona Jaffe has shot up to my second all time favorite author. I didn't think it could get better than 'The Best Of Everything'...but I was wrong.This book, which covers the 100 years of Rose Glover's life, is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read a lot. We meet Rose at age 10 in the year 1910, after her mother's death. And we follow her straight to the year 1999. We follow her life, and the lives of her brother, step-mother, 3 daughters, and their offspring. This books covers so much, that's it's hard to sum up in a little review.I absolutely recommend this read. Those who like family sagas will LOVE it, and those interested in years past will really take to how clearly Ms. Jaffe paints a picture of life in those days. I look forward to the rest of Ms. Jaffe's books, and can't wait to get to the library to check out the next one!"
2,What a Disappointing Book!,"I read ""Five Women"" which I thought was ok, so I decided to read this. First I want to know how any of Jaffe's books become Best Sellers on the New York Times Best Seller List? Her writing style is like that of an eighth grader (eighth graders write better). I had a hard time connecting to the characters, because I feel Jaffe did not develop them well, the characters were not believable.I basically read this book so I could finish it and get on to something more challenging."
5,A Nostalgic Trip in Time,"I loved this book! It could have been anyone's family, I agree, but it was a trip in time. The author took you through a time capsule with her references to historical happenings and historical inventions. With each time period I was remembering where I was during that time period and how old I was. Even though it started well before I was born, it related to times in history that my family spoke of.I loved Jaffe's characters. She touched on all kinds of different scenarios and personalities in this family. She was proving that no family is spared from tragedy or joys.I found the book to be a very fast read, probably because you really didn't want to put it down. I was sorry it ended. It is nice to know that a story can be told and keep your attention without violence and sex. I have been telling everyone about this book. It has to be one of the best reads I have had for a long time. What a delightful change!!"
3,It's catchy.,"This wasn't a bad Batman tale by any means, considering it jumped on the bandwagon in the midst of the ""Outbreak"" type movies and TV fads about killer viruses. However, it's too much to take up a year's worth of issues for this one tale. Part sleeper and part intrigue, it reduced Batman back to his detective roots, but too many characters besides Batman kind of gives one the runaround. It's a must read if you plan on reading its slightly better sequel, Legacy."
2,It did not live up to its hype.,"Collects the Contagion storyline that ran in all Batman related books. Overall, the book isn't so bad. There were some great moments such as Batman and Nightwing teaming together, Robin's dreams, and... I guess that's it. There were so many letdowns mainly because each writer seems to want to steer the story to his own direction rather than work as a whole. Major letdowns are the supposed major roles played by the Penguin and Poison Ivy, the quest for the plague cure, the annoying involvement of Catwoman and the resolution of the story. I had expected better."
2,A silly mish-mash,"This is essentially what you get if you take an essentially decent idea for a Batman story and then spread it over about seven different comics belonging to four different characters, and several writers and artists. The plot is disjointed and the art varies between excellent and mediocre. That said, it was a pleasant enough inconsequencial read."
2,Ho-hum!,I wasn't reading DC Comics when this storyline was new and this storyline would be a prime example of why. The premise is simple and awesome. I deadly virus that pushes Gotham City to the brink of destruction. A hero who can't let that happen. Unfortunately the execution was pretty off. The art varied from terrible to ok but the main problem was the cornball dialogue and the strange plotting. DC could have had something huge. A swing and a miss.
5,Wow,"I'm glad I'm first. This CD came up when I searched DBT and I'm glad as hell it did. I listened to the samples but they do it no justice. It's very country, and extremely amazing. Every song will touch something from the crickets in the intro until the hidden track. The sounds are haunting and raw. I just wish I could find more info on the band to invite them to Morgantown, WV. Play 123 Pleasant St and you will sell out, guaranteed."
4,1967 [live] maynard ferguson,"maynard is crisp and on the mark. The Canadian band is tight and Maynard excells probably because of the new members. Make no mistake these cats are good. Its nice to have Maynard augment the band with vibes and guitar, Nice solos. If they stayed together for a period of time it would be one of his finest bands. I only wish Maynard would front a BIG band and play some of his older charts"
3,MAYNARD RETURNS TO CANADA,"THIS ALBUM WAS RECORDED IN MONTREAL DURING EXPO '67. THE BAND IS ALL CANADIAN, AND WHILE THEY ARE TECHNICALLY COMPETENT, THEY DON'T SWING AS HARD AS MAYNARD'S BRITISH OR AMERICAN BANDS."
2,misleading ad,sure it a -3an aeroquip line but it sure isnt the 15 ft like the title states....now that i look over the description it does say that its 10ft...very misleading ad
5,Very Resourceful,I found this book to be valuable. It zeroes right in on the major problems of grammar in both writing and speaking. I even have a copy at work.
3,Needed this to access archived data - works well,"I run the books for two little mining companies and the original books were in Simply - I switched to Quickbooks and needed a licence to access the archived data (for audit and regulatory queries), so I bought this and it works like a champ. Doesn't have all the bell and whistles of QB, but what does? Tech support is excellent, and when I needed to renew the license it was just over a hundred dollars, which is very reasonable."
1,Disappointing language from Scholastic,"My 8 year old daughter was very excited to read this book, and I admit, I thought she had picked out a good one. But she never made it past page 19, because she had already showed me 3 instances of cuss words. I was very disappointed in Scholastic to say the least. They advertise this book as a 9-12 year old level story. Use some common sense!"
4,Excellent book but getting a bit out dated,"This is an excellent book but is getting to be a bit out dated. If it was current, it would rate 5 stars contrary to the other reviews. It clearly separates the hype and hysteria from the reality, hoax from real viruses, and provides a good general background and history. This is a book for computer users, not virus creators or gurus."
1,Terrible book,One of the worst books written.Robert Slade is a hypercritical book reviewer.I thought that his book would be decent.But it is a lousy book.
1,Amateur,"Let's get one thing clear ... this guide is woefully out of date. But that's the least of its problems. More disappointing is Slade's demonstrated lack of expertise on this subject. He's simply a librarian, culling some obvious facts and figures and resources from the mainstream without truly understanding it.Worse, he can't write. His poorly constructed sentences are incomprehensible. For example: ""It seems to be related to Cohen's proof, by contradiction, that the problem of identification of any given program as 'viral' or 'non-viral' is undecidable."" Eh? And there's page after page of prose like this! This is a disaster masquerading as a book."
1,skip this one,"I found this book totally inconsistent and boring. Don't waste your money, and more importantly, your time!"
1,A Refund,Astonishingly inept and dull. The book's only redeeming quality was the ability to return it for a full refund.
1,Little Use For Anyone,"I'm siding with the majority on this one. As a corporate IS infrastructure manager, viruses are a big concern of mine and I need to keep current with all practical news. After reading several chapters of this quilt patchwork, liberally borrowed from other sources, I put it aside in frustration. I don't consider this to be the work of a professional -- the writing is simply too awkward. I also question whether anyone would find much value in his advice. For example, what are we suppose to make of this piece of wisdom: ""Sending a virus to a sex-related newsgroup seems to be a reliable way to ensure that a large number of stupid people will read and execute your program, and start your new virus off with a bang.""Give me a break (and my money back)!"
5,Great book,"I'm a long-time PageMaker user (from version 3) and unlike the person who wrote a most derogatory review of this book : 'they were text oriented' and did not like the pictures, I thought they really helped me learn to use the software. As they say, ""a picture is worth a thousand words""... Why would one wade through oceans of text when they could look at the pictures of the various palettes and get an overall sense of what Sandee is explaining. This is an excellent book, better than The Classroom in a Book, which I abandoned after purchasing Sandee's book"
1,Mistaken identity,"I am pretty, very sure that this is not the album you are looking for if you are looking for Imogen Heap and Frou Frou. First of all, Frou Frou tracks are all in english. This similarily named album is all in French."
4,Large Turkey Roaster,This roaster worked well for our 30 lb turkey. It cleaned up easily. The only criticism that the measurements did not descibe the length as including the outer handles.
5,turkey pan,I was so happy when I finally found this pan. As soon as I received it I used it to cook turkeys. I make 15-20 turkeys every Thanksgiving for a soup kitchen meal and this pan arrived at the perfect time. I willing be buying a few more for my daughters and daughter-in-law.
2,Defective Merchandise,"I didn't like my pan due to the fact that it arrived with rust spots in it. Looks as if the paint was chipped in a few spots and those area had rusted. This was extremely frustrating, especially with the Thanksgiving holiday being just two days away when my roaster arrived.One Extremely Dissapointed Customer,Marvin DabneyPS Please bear in mind, I spent over five hundred dollars just last Christmas with Amazon.Com purchasing a 50"" Panasonic flat screen tv."
5,Great pan!,This pan accommodates a 25lbs. bird. It cooked my turkey 90 min. sooner than using the old way of a foil pan and a tin foil dome. The enamal coating makes it a breeze to clean up. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect pan. Well maybe a handle directly on top would be nice.
5,21ib turkey fit,I've used Granite Ware roaster for years but just not big enough for the family get together. Always needed additional meat.
4,Cooking the turkey,"Faced with needing to cook an eighteen pound turkey and not having an adequate roaster, we set out to find one. Rather than drive around spending a day and $30 on gas we went on-line. We had a similar but smaller Granite Ware roaster for many years so we were favorably familiar with the product. One reviewer commented on the light weight. It is considerably lighter than the first one, but after using it twice, this has not been a negative. In fact, saving a couple of pounds makes it easier to manage. The width dimension does not include the handles. Our oven is 22 1/2"" and we still are just able to get it in by placing it diagonally."
3,Size does count,"Be aware that advertised dimensions are overall external size, the actual inside dimension is 16 x 11-1/2 inch. If you need an extra-large pan this may not be what you are looking for. Otherwise it is a medium quality roaster as advertised."
1,"Arrived chipped, like other reviewers said","Not sure if it was the packing or what but it arrived chipped and dented. Returned it, won't order again."
1,Poor Quality!!! Made In Mexico!!!,"This roaster was of very poor quality, Made in Mexico! The edges were sharp and the exterior was rough. I accidentally rubbed my hand over an area which I didn't know was badly chipped and these sharp metal pieces went into my skin. OUCH!!! I returned this roaster and purchased the Granite Ware 19 inch Covered Oval Roaster instead."
2,"Good pan, poor packaging","Looked like a great pan online and we need a nice size roaster for the Thanksgiving turkey. Unfortunately, the packaging is nothing more than the pan directly in the Amazon box - no other protection. There were spots of crushed enamel where one handle was attached to the lid. I didn't go further than that and am going to be returning. I love enamelled pans but not worth the low price to get a defective pan from shipping."
4,"Seems great, but not the stated size","Just received this roasting pan in advance of a large Thanksgiving gathering. The stated size is 21.25"" x 14"" x 8.5"". The length of the roasting pan is 17.5"", at most. Apparently, they included the handles in the length-wise measurement. Looks great, just expected the actual roasting area to be 21.25""!"
5,Love my roaster,"My mother has one like it (although oval, not rectagular) and has used it for as long as I can remember to roast everything from turkeys to beef and vegetables. It's difficult to find a roaster with a lid these days and I was so pleased to find that these were still made. I used my new one to roast my Thanksgiving turkey and it worked beautifully."
3,MADE IN MEXICO NOT USA,"This is an adequate product, has sharp edges and is pretty thin metal, but should suffice. I bought it after reading the description and last sentence states made in U.S.A.. Apparently nobody told the people down in Mexico that prominently stamp made in MEXICO on the label."
5,Granite Ware Roaster,"I love this roaster. Perfect size. Item arrived within a few days. Extra bonus...Lid is flat so it can be used as a pan as well, great for making large batchs of chicken and dumplings"
2,not as represented,Purchased this roaster directly through amazon. It is clearly indicated in the product description that the roaster is made in the USA. It is not. On the removable sticker on the roaster it is clearly indicated that it was made in Mexico by Granite Ware. I would send it back due to the misrepresentation but I needed a roaster immediately and had to use the Mexican roaster. Don't be fooled. If you want a roaster made in the USA this is not the one.
1,Terrible Packaging,"The item was not properly packaged. It had no bubble wrap or any padding around the roaster and so it arrived with large chips in the enamel which makes it unsafe for cooking. I had to return the product and was given a full refund. However, when I asked if I re-ordered the product if it would be packaged better, I was given the answer ""no"" the packaging would be the same. So I did not re-order as it would be inevitable that the enamel would be chipped."
1,discription said like new,"It was bang up and with scratches, but Amazone took it back without any problem. so thanks will buy again."
1,service on roaster,I cannot yet rate this product. I ordered it for my daughter about 8 weeks ago and she still hasn't received it. I'm very disappointed and will not order from here again.
1,"Made in Mexico, and very bad condition","I am having to return this product. The description says its a genuine american made granite ware roaster. The one that arrived was made in mexico, and had about 5 or 6 places where the porcelain coating was missing, and the metal was ridiculously thin and flimsy. Walmart sells cheap granite ware for about 10 dollars that is far superior to this."
3,Poor packaging,"The product is decent, except the lid could fit a little better.When the product arrived, it was chipped in one spot due to poor packaging."
2,Warped,"I just bought a rectangular graniteware roaster with lid at my hardware store. I checked to make sure it's graniteware and not an imitation (it was graniteware). The items are packaged ""nested."" When I took them apart to wash, the components were warped so badly the lid and base did not fit together. I also noted on the directions that it can go through the dishwasher but cannot be used on the top of the stove for making gravy--and absolutely NOT on a glass cooktop. The lid is big enough to be its own roaster. So, although I could actually have 2 open roasters of different sizes, I will return the item and look for another sort of covered roaster. Note: I know most roasters come without lids because it's not really roasting if you cover the meat tightly while cooking. I just want the lid for when I remove the meat from the oven so it doesn't splash."
5,Granite Ware Rectangle Roaster,This rectangle roaster is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone that cooks large turkeys or other large pieces of meat.
3,Shadow of the Green God...,"This disc, finally available to hardcore fans, is what is is... Not to put it down, but the word 'round the campfire was that Mr.Green had very little to do with these sessions and let everyone else do the work and he put in some basic and rudimentary guitar solos as to sate the voracious appitites of Greenie-philes like myself. Clearly, IN THE SKIES is superior, but this has its moments of clarity and brilliance, but unfortunately, they ARE fleeting. Great care was put into remastering and providing bonus tracks on this 4th reissue from his PVK recordings. Really makes you wonder what may have happened if he had signed the Warner Brothers contract back in 1977 and had more work and input from his former cronies in the 'Mac. DO buy this if you're into having EVERYTHING from Mr.Greenbaum. DO NOT BUY this if you are a casual fan, then you can look up the MAN OF THE WORLD compilation from Sanctuary. Hope this helps!!! Peace and chicken grease!"
4,A Rare Find,"I have wanted the music score from the Allistaire Sims version of ""Scrooge - A Christmas Carol"" for some time and finally found it here."
5,The Film Music of Richard Addinsell,"I have been a fan of the book , ""The Black Rose"" for many, many years. The movie, never seemed to equal the book, except for the music! The ""Black Rose"" theme repeats throughout the movie. It is a truly glorious piece of music! I never tire of hearing it. This is a wonderful CD!!! I have nothing negative to say about it. I just love hearing track 13 with the ""Black Rose theme""! Wonderful music!!! Beautiful music!!! I just set my CD player to repeat track 13! Richard Addinsell was a remarkably gifted composer!"
3,the film music of richard addinsell,"The version of the warsaw concerto was a little shorter even though it is the best piece. It was my reason for buying this album although I have better versions of it on an album called 'film piano concertos'. Most of the other stuff on this album seemed a little too flowery but there are moments I quite enjoyed. Its soft enough to put me to sleep and I personally think that is rare, becasue most classical has too many moments of sudden surprises."
3,Only a couple enjoyed,"I guess I expected more music from the classic SCROOGE, with Alister Syms. But, I did like the music from GOODBYE MR. CHIPS. Otherwise, not very much more on this CD."
2,Not quite,"I am a huge Depeche Mode, and I enjoy Vince Clarke's other work with Yaz (Yazoo) and Erasure. His contribution as producer is what drew me to this album. Based on his other work, it's not up to snuff. The synths are good but the songs and vocals lack whatever it is that makes songs listen-able. This one comes out mediocre at best."
3,"Ok, but not great.","I have had this double boiler for awhile now, and have used it to make many savoury sauces. However, today I decided to make some tapioca pudding, which I find best done in a double boiler, to prevent scorching. The good news is that it worked beautifully. The bad news is that my pudding tastes like a savoury sauce. Perhaps spaghetti sauce? I can't quite put my finger on it.This is always washed in the dishwasher on a heavy cycle, and is always cleaned perfectly. I cannot believe that the non-stick coating would absorb flavours, but it apparently has.So I guess my advice would be to purchase two if you intend to use this for sweet things and sauces."
4,Perfect for the use intended!,"This is much cheaper than buying a double broiler which is missing since our kitchen remodel. I like the grooves, since it will fit in different size pans! Definitely recommend!"
5,Yay for peppermint bark!,This double boiler is exactly what I was looking for! It's so incredibly convenient -- fits in just about any sized pan you want to use -- and the chocolate I was melting to make peppermint bark turned out GREAT! I would highly recommend this product for anyone who doesn't want to buy an entire double boiler but still wants to make melted chocolate goodness. :)
5,Awesome!,Received this today and melted some chocolate with it. Fantastic product! The chocolate melted wonderfully and didn't even look like I needed to worry about it seizing. The clean up was easy. Definitely recommend this double boiler!
2,Hard to use,"This is supposed to be a universal double boiler, but it's hard to use because it fits no pan well -- making it hard to stir, and giving you a limited ""surface area"" for use. Also, due to it's curved bottom, it won't stand up on its own if you remove it from the ""boiling"" pan (to set beside you as you mold candy, etc.)"
3,does the job,the product does what it says and is an inexpensive alternative to buying a double boiler set.the few drawbacks are ...the shape is a bit too 'cone-like' where the pot goes too far into the outter pot (when melting chocolate the inner pot shouldn't ever hit the water) and the groves on the outside are also on the inside. they should have coated over the inside to make it completely smooth. the groves just hold alot of chocolate and make scraping the inside of the pot harder.the biggest drawback though is the lack of a handle that doesnt get hot. it's hard to pour the chocolate into molds when holding this with one hand in a pot holder.
3,Hard to Scrape Out Broiler Pan,"I bought this pan because it got some good reviews and despite my sense that the ridges might make it hard to scrape any melted chocolate/butter out of it. I thought I perhaps hadn't understood just how it fits into a pan. Alas! My initial impressions were correct. Melted chocolate IS hard to scrape out of the pan; and, invariably, some gets trapped in the ridges and remains in the pan. I think it's good to have at least one pan like this for traveling and for moments when a regular double broiler is in use. However, I'd be happier with it if the price were much, much lower. By the time one adds shipping, a lot of money has been invested in a product that really could be much better."
2,Hardly non-stick,"I have used this pan for eggs a couple of times and when I add a little cheese to the mix it took a lot to clean it off. Yes, I did coat with oil prior to use. Probably will not use much anymore."
4,Nice Product,"I like this because it is inexpensive and versatile. I am not sure that the non-stick coating will hold up over time. When I am melting chocolate, I really need to use a metal spoon, so I can feel it scratching the finish. It gets very hot (of course), so always be careful when using it."
2,good for clinicians... perhaps family members,The active addict or alcoholic will be driven to use out of their lack of interest. Rather dry but informative for clinician or inquisitive concerned persons.
3,"Good, but lacks content.",I purchased this product in hopes of learning more about human behavior and how the mind attaches to things and how it learns to deattach. Seems to me more of a rating docmunetary that one looking really to teach and inform.
2,Addiction documentary,I didn't not care for this. It was about Steven Baldwin's Cocaine addiction and his persoanl life. It was not educational or interesting. Drama... Boring!
5,the sweetest soul,"Sweet soul music is the deal on the disc. All of the tracks are true examples of sweet soul music, and sound good--crisp and clean.As a Curtis Mayfield fan, i was thrilled to find this cd on amazon, had to purchase it. this isn't just a compliation of Curtis Mayfield, but if features his work as a musicisan, as an impresario, as a producer. this is a prerequisite for anyone interested in soul music,; anyone who is a fan of Curtis Mayfield; anyone who wants to explore the, ""Chicago sound."" But, don't take my word for it. Get if for yourself. You won't be disappointed."
3,Complex Yet Nice,"This product reminds me of Intuit's Turbo Tax. It is wonderful to get you through the nightmare of taxes, but again the subject........business plans..... It is never easy to do a business plan. This package will ease the time required to complete the task and greatly help you with organization."
4,Take this One With You,"This is a great guide to take with you on a trip to Normandy. I carried it with me throughout my tours and was able to read aloud about the events that took place-standing on Omaha Beach and reading about the various divisions that struggled where I stood was of great value to myself and my husband.The eyewitness accounts bring it to life as well.If you plan on touring the D Day beaches and sites, bring this one with you!"
3,That darn skipping rope!,"The information on the DVD is pretty good. The only reason I'm rating it a 3 is because I'm not a good skipper. I've had so many ""gashes"" on my arms from tripping on the rope. Grrr.. The participants make it look so easy, so it is motivating to keep tying."
5,Where can I get more Burnt Taters CDs?!,"One of the best songs on this CD is ""My Wicked Aunt Lavinia."" I have listened to that one and Mr. Molio over and over again!! I never get bored listening to this CD numerous times because the tunes are so catchy!! I find myself humming them all through my day!! Where can I buy more Burnt Taters CDs? You definitely will be singing Mr. Molio after the first few times of hearing it!!"
1,Can I make this a negative star?,"This book is horrifyingly cute and offensively patronizing. The assumption is that the women reading it are stupid to the point of immobility. A paraphrase as an example: In defining and naming the four suits, clubs are ""sometimes known as puppy paw-prints.""We had a huge laugh over this book at our monthly ladies' poker night, but it wasn't a good laugh. It was derisive laughter. We looked and looked for some indication that the book was meant to be funny, but couldn't find it.The (female!) authors should be ashamed. Unless you're itching to get smacked, do not buy this book for the woman in your life who wants to learn poker."
5,"Finally, all the secrets of Poker revealed!","This is an informative, smartly written book that is filled with details and tips on various games of poker. I enjoyed the wit and humor of the prose as well all the games packed into this book. The writers have a real flair and I learned alot from this book. Sometimes the writing reminded me of Sex in the City, very urbane and witty. Anyone (male or fremale) who is clueless about poker could benefit from reading this book. They even show you how to better your luck if you get stuck with a DUD hand.All the women at my Saturday night game had better look out! Momma has an ace up her sleeve and I got it from this book!"
3,"1967, Moe Koffman",This album is good for adding to your collection of Koffman's music. It is not the best of his music.
2,Doesn't Drain into Sink,"Could not find this in the stores so I bought it here. It would be wonderful if it only drained into the sink. They needed another 1/2"" so it drains properly into the sink and not on my counter. Probably would work fine with an undermount sink."
4,"Italian rap CD that's hip, upbeat, and great dance music","Even if you can't understand Italian (I don't) this CD is amazing to listen to. It is the best CD I have ever heard, and I am an alternative music fan for the most part. You will fall in love with the Italian language in no time. I first heard this CD in Europe where it was all the rage the summer of 96, and where Jovanotti still is incredibly popular, esp in his native Italy. If you like upbeat, contagious, feel good music to dance to, this is the perfect CD. It's essentially Italian rap, with a little bit of reggae, and latin beat...a whole medley of great sounds that will put you in the best mood."
3,"Fun, but a little dated","I wish I had found this CD ten years ago. I would have loved it then. Now, like fade haircuts and MC Hammer pants, it all seems out-of-date (ok, maybe it's not that bad). Worth a few listens, but I'm guessing that unless you're already a fan, it probably won't become a favorite CD."
5,One of today's most creative artists,"This is one of, if the not the best, CD I own. I fell in love with Jovanotti in 94 when his ""Lorenzo 1994"" album came out, and since bought all his albums, older and newest, and they are all my favourites. In this compilation you will find a mix of many styles, ranging from pure old-school hip-hop to pop, cutting through funk, jazz, reggae and world music. In addition to his beautiful music, Jovanotti has some of the best and most meaningful lyrics I have ever heard. If you don't speak Italian, it is a big loss, but I am sure you will be able to appreciate the music nevertheless since it is, for lack of a better description, all but perfect!"
5,"Fun, fun, fun!!!","...just make you want to dance forever! Take a minute to listen to it, and you'll never stop!"
5,Great music for tumultuous years,"This set contains the equivalent of several albums plus some rare tracks and a live album (Roma 1972) which was since released on another label. This is intense music produced during tumultuous years for Piazzolla and Argentina in general. It is sometimes sad, sometimes contemplative, and sometimes just rolling. The synthesis of styles is breathtaking. This not tango, just incredible modern popular music. An amazing value given the quantity of music."
2,Too old for new computers!,"If you are thinking of buying this product be sure to check to see if your computer is compatible. We have a Mac OS X and the Tortoise and the Hare is too old a program for it. As far as we can tell it runs only on version 7. Don't be mislead by the fact that is says for Mac versions 7 or higher on the case, it is not true and I suspect it will be a similar situation for computers running Windows."
4,"Toto, I found you","This is a good example of an album where the second side is better than the first. Even though ""Rosanna"" is a great song, the rest of the music on side one sounds exactly the same. The songwriting for each song on side one is so similar to each other, it's not even funny. Of course, it's melodic and enjoyable, so I'm not really complaining.Side two opens with a burning rubber guitar riff rocker, and following that is an almost Electric Light Orchesta-like pop song. There's another song on the second side that sounds like something Stevie Wonder would do (""Waiting for Your Love"") and of course, I don't even NEED to mention the song that closes the album. It's the song that introduced me, and I'm sure thousands of other people, to the band (no, it wasn't ""Hold the Line""- nice try, though!)Well, side two is the clear winner for me. How many times did a band save their better material for the second half of an album? Doesn't happen often!"
4,Afraid of Toto? it can be good for you!,"This is Toto at their peak of popularity. IV contains all-time eighties classic pop tracks like ""Rosanna"", ""i won't hold you down"" and the memorable ""Africa"".Every song could be potencial hit twenty years ago but sadly now the whole album is sounding a bit annoying.the production and aranges are simply sounding old. Well, but still under the whole 80's stuff we have a solid pop-rock album - the melodies are very pleasent and it is a perfect album for a summer holiday or car riding.without any serious lyrics (mostly the lyrics are containing things like ""i saw you yesterday and i loved you"" or ""please forgive me and don't break my heart"" stuff) or ecological and global warnings popular then ""TOTO IV"" can give you 40 minutes of enjoyment and fun.If you like eighties music you will love this album after first listening...if you don't you will leave this propably.well - still it is a pop and rock classic work."
1,BEWARE...there's a multi-channel version available,"I give this SACD version just one star because there's an updated version in SACD that happens to be multi-channel, whereas this is just STEREO. I don't find much reason to have this one, or any stereo SACDS for that matter, cause the change from the CD is not worth it. So there's no reason for you to have this SACD version instead of the Multi-channel, except of course, if you have your player hooked to a stereo amplifier. But even then, you will miss the slightly different sound that the songs have because of the new mixing in the Multi-Channel SACD. It's a little more expensive, but is better. Just look for it here in Amazon. THE SOUND IS COMPLETELY AMAZING ! NOTE: look for it under ""TOTO"" in ""POPULAR MUSIC"". For some reason, the M.CH.TOTO IV is not listed in the search list of SACD's."
5,Excellent Sonud Quality !!,"Tha audio separation of this SACD it's just amazing, i heard musical instruments that i didn't before !!"
3,Solid and listenable.,"Toto IV contains a respectable collection of songs. All ten of the tracks are listenable. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are good. ""Africa"" and ""I Won't Hold You Back"" are my favorite tunes. ""I Won't Hold You Back"" is a very impressive ballad from these guys. Steve Lukather does a nice job with the vocals. The backing vocals are impressive, too. Toto IV is a good pop rock album. Worth a listen."
2,"Some of the tracks are good, but CD is boring as a whole","I remember when ""Toto IV"" was one of those albums everybody had to get, or at least was familiar with because of the radio play. So it was a favorite at the dances. ""Rosanna"" still resonates as perhaps the group's best song on any disc, and ""Africa"" was a lot of fun, too, for a while. Otherwise, what is there? Overall, this is a collection of unremarkable songs that start out OK, but become repetitive after about the first minute or so. ""Afraid of Love"" is the only other song that stands repeated listening. Tracks 3 and 7 work if you're in the right mood to put up with the lyrics, but that's about it. ""Hydra"" still stands as the group's most interesting album, in my opinion, even though it's pretty much overlooked and gets mixed reviews. It only produced one Top 40 single but, where ""Toto IV"" fails to be anything memorable after the first song ends, ""Hydra"" succeeds as an entire CD worth listening to repeatedly."
2,Two Hits With Nothing In Between,"""Toto IV"" can be summed up pretty simply. The album kicks off with the massive hit ""Rosanna,"" and concludes with another massive hit, ""Africa."" In between it contains scarcely a song worth hearing. The strong pop hooks that make the two hits so appealing are utterly absent. The rest is merely midtempo filler material that no one other than an ardent fan will likely ever want to hear more than once. This stuff is the very difinition of soulless professionalism.Still, there are those two big hits, and given that Toto's only other successful single was ""Hold the Line"" from their first album, buying ""Toto IV"" makes almost as much sense as buying the band's greatest hits album."
4,"Wild Sea, Indeed","Redemption, grief, recovery and the challenge of a new lover -- these are familiar themes. But their familiarity needn't be a barrier to a good read, and but for one flaw, ""A Wild Sea"" is a good read, indeed. The flaw? It's too short for themes of such depth.Montague does a very believable, moving job with characters and plot, but it just seemed to wrap up too neatly and quickly toward the end. ""Watermark"" -- which for me sets the standard for romances dealing with grief -- is probably a third longer than ""A Wild Sea"" and delivered that much more high impact characterization and depth of plot. But for its relative shortness, this was an excellent romance. I will be pursuing all of Rebecca Montague's other books and crossing my fingers that they will get as long as they need to be and the writer's talent will be allowed to flower to its very fullest. Women of Cape Winds Press please note: readers have a longer attention span than you seem to think."
3,The main protagonist's conflict is needlessly drawn out.,"Perhaps it takes a Radclyffe to elicit credible tension from a heroine's excessive reluctance to commit her heart--the emotional conflict at the center of A Wild Sea goes slack well before the book is ended, perhaps because the physical action is relatively uneventful, and the younger love object does not seem particularly magnetic, just wholesome and even-tempered."
1,Absolute Garbage!,"My students have more elevating literature to read. This particular piece of ""literature"" belongs rolled around on that little cardboard roll which one finds at the middle of a toilet tissue roll. Nice name - ""Tookie."" It figures this book is raved about by every neo-socialist NY Times reading liberal out there!"
1,A real inner city folk hero....,"I find it interesting that the author would make such a wonderful effort to help children, after having murdered parents. I wonder if he sent autographed free copies to the children of the people he murdered.I also find it interesting, that in over 20 years on death row, he was only able to write a handful of ""children's books"".That these books would find their way into our public school systems, where this man takes on the role of Martyr and Folk Hero, speaks volumes about our schools.The book is as shallow as the man who wrote it."
2,Not Much for the $$$,"The legs were bought to mount on a Kozy World KWN191 18,000-BTU Vent-Free Natural-Gas Infrared Wall Heater. Legs are pieces of plastic much the same as the ones included with a standard box fan. Two pieces of plastic that should come included in the box by Cozy World. The cost of $18 is ridiculous for no more than what they are. The Kozy World heater is not that impressive to begin with but for the price they cost, they need to include not only these legs but the fan and any other accessories required to make them work 100%. After I purchased the legs and the fan, (which you can't buy locally at the same store ---Lowe's), with shipping cost AND the kit required to hook it up to gas, I had to shell out another $80! BIC Superstore shipped fast but the cost was high to ship to TN."
1,Not needed legs,This was dissappointing as we ordered the heater that these legas go to and the legs did not arrive untuil ten days after we needed them. Our plumber used the legs from the previous gas heater and they worked fine. These legs are plastic and cost 19.00 dollars. A pure waste of money. Now trying to figure out how to send them back without being chardged for the shipping.
1,Extremely Biased,"I just completed a college course on American government that used this book. It leans extremely to the left and attempts to portray opinions as facts. To young people with no prior knowledge of politics, this book can be very influential, with inaccrate portrayals of many key events and Constitutional Amendments. An example is the extremely biased interpretations of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. For every clause and amendment, this book gives its own opinions of what it means. One blatant example is how it says the ""militia"" in the Constitution is the ""National Guard"" today. I believe that the only thing this book is good for is for use as an example of how bad and biased textbooks can be!"
4,More 80s Euro dance from Blanco Y Negro!!!!!,"I cannot praise Blanco Y Negro more highly for the incredible work they've been doing remastering and releasing rare, out of print 80s dance music to a starved audience. The selection of songs is spot-on, the sound is great... and they are well over 60 titles to choose from.If you enjoy European synth dance 80s.... look no further. The price tag may be a bit steep, but it's worth every penny!"
2,CD Player Problems,"I have had this system for 2 years - CD changer broke just before 1 year warranty expired, sent to Onkyo and was repaired. Recently started experiencing same problems as before - won't eject CD's - have had to shake the player while holding it vertically to recover my discs. This is too bad as Onkyo generally has a good name in audio."
1,big disappointment,"CD player skips. Check Onkyo web page, most reviews posted there have same comment. Also CD unit way too deep to use as bookshelf system. Wasted almost $60 in shipping. Bought TEAC mini last Christmas as gift, much more satisfied."
2,Bad CD,"Big problems with the CD player, just makes noises all the time, doesn't work at all, won't open. Nice small system, CD kills it."
1,CD Changer (C-707CHX) Defective,"Six weeks after purchase of the product, the CD Changer component (Model C-707CHX) failed. Basically upon loading a CD, the changer would not play, nor would it open back up to remove the CD. Upon doing a Google search by the model number, I found that C-707CHX has a long history of this particular problem. Also since Amazon only provides a 30-day return policy, at 45-days I am forced to deal directly with OnkyoUSA for warranty service. Sadly their customer service was most notable only for its indifference. While I am attempting to coordinate warranty service with one of their authorized service centers, the results are still unknown."
2,"Great sound, poor service","Used the MC35TECH in my office at low volume. Very pleased with this unit for first two years: great sound, terrific reception. However, after the power unit on my receiver died I learned that Onkyo does not sell the components of this system as replacement parts. The only way to replace the receiver is to buy an entire new system. So I sent in to Onkyo Service Center. Long story but $200 spent and 3 weeks later the unit is still not repaired and now I am looking at buying an entirely new system. I've been a long-time fan of Onkyo and have several Onkyo systems but after this experience I'm not sure I will buy another Onkyo."
1,CD Player has many problems,Great little reciever. CD player has many problems. See discussions about problems. Do not purchase this system.
1,WAR STORIES RIP OFF,Save your money. Same old WW2 vids we've all seen before. If I had seen this same video when it came out on TV the first time I would have changed channels. Boring!!
4,SI,"Este libro reune los textos de uno de los mas grandes estilistas del cuentocorto latinoamericano. Con su penetracion sicologica y su deshinibicion para retratar al olvidado, al perdedor, al que siempre esta fuera de la historia."
4,Mostly awesome,A couple of awesome tracks Revival Reggae and Pee Pee Cluck Cluck. Others are good too.
2,Sensationalist fearmongering,"This book consists primarily of sensationalist fearmongering. It is a heavily one-sided picture, attempting to stir in the reader a sense of fear. The book also gives credence to virtually every rumor, half-truth, or conspiracy theory of the last century.The book also contains a reasonable amount of basic information, but the breathless hype with which it was delivered leaves me wondering how much of even the most basic information is true.This book might be useful to a small extent if read in counterbalance with a more sober account."
3,Just a good software,"I honestly thought this would be a great software based on the only review that appears and the rate this product has, however I was disappointed, I believe that this is a good product but does not deserve 5 stars.It has beautiful graphics but there are not a lot of them, many graphics are from Microsoft Clip Art Gallery.The fonts are almost the same we can found in Office, except for a few of them (10 at the most).On the other hand I find it easy to use and not a lot of computer skills or knowledge is needed. Besides the craft section I found it really good, you can do party hats, baskets, boxes for gifts, envelopes, doorhangs, etc.It is a good but not outstanding product."
5,Excellent greeting card software,i had another one i did not like was too confusing to use this one art explosion deluxe it so easy. I only use this one from now on for everything. Try it!
2,Photosuite is better,"I have used Roxio's Photosuite for a couple of years and while Art Explosion offers greater variety, it crashes more often (WinXP) and is very time consuming to insert photos. The program default directory is embedded deep in the Progam Folder, while my pictures are all in ""My Pictures"" folder. I couldn't find a way to change the default and the program doesn't recognize shortcuts.Tried to get customer support, but the rep. was not very knowledgeable - kept telling me they were following Microsoft's recommendation and there was no way to change the location of ""My Pictures"" folder."
2,good but not great,"This program was easy to use and had nice graphics, but I can believe it had no calendar section! You could make a party hat, but not a calendar! Go figure. It was a waste of my money."
4,"Great game, lousy Product Description","This is a great combination of games if you're looking for a dose of Crash to take on the go, but...whoever wrote the Product Description for this entry only has half a clue what they're talking about. The cartridge does indeed contain Crash Nitro Kart, a rather decent portable port of the console Kart racers. But I'm not sure where they got that 'N-Hanced' thing from--as even the box image itself tells you, the other game on the cartridge is Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, which is a 'normal' Crash game with platforming and other elements. Though to be honest...waaay too many of the 'hamster-ball' levels compared to the classic platforming, IMHO."
2,The worlds greatest idea on the world worst shirt,"I love these shirts for their design, but something needs to be done about the quality of the t-shirt they are printed on. They're ridiculously light-weight, with a uncomfortably thin neckline and bad stitching.I'm sure it would wear out quickly, if I could bring myself to wear mine for very long. The shirt is simply the worst quality garment I own.Switch to a better quality, heavyweight cotton shirt and you have a winner on your hands. I hope someone takes notice!"
5,"Fresh, funny text and hilariously appropriate illustrations","Based on a traditional counting song, Steven Kellogg's fresh, funny text and hilariously appropriate illustrations engage young readers preschool through second grade on a rollicking good time as the popular nursery rhyme escalates into a slapstick adventure involving cobblers, cats, chickens, sled dogs, even velociraptors. The ever-increasing number of clever companions adds up to a unique counting book that ends with the last old man surrounded by a lovable crowd of canine friends. Give The Dog A Bone is an original take on a childhood classic and highly recommended for family, school, and public library children's books collections."
5,knob lover,"What a deal! The black knobs were just what we were looking for, and we paid less than half of what we would have paid at Home D. We're very pleased."
1,Beautiful knobs.,"I looked at many sites and stores for knobs that weren't too exspensive, but didn't look cheap. These knobs fit the bill. They are beautiful and excellent quality."
1,Avoid 'High Dive' and buy McKee's earlier work,"What a disappointment. I've been a Maria McKee fan for 15 years-yet after one listening I sold this CD to the used-CD store up the street. The album is a mess-its mood is inconsistent and its lyrics uninteresting. And Mckee's voice, so lovely, is little more then background noise. What happened to the Maria Mckee that appeared in her first solo albums-the southern savant with the haunting voice? This is an unmotivated offering from a woman who can belt."
1,Wow.....What a mess,"I will start by saying that there was a time when I thought anything this woman wrote or sang was gold. I have listened to this album three times now and, at best, it is sounds like ""B"" sides and throw aways from other efforts. A few times, I thought I was listening to a bad lounge act. Maria, you can do much more! I wanted badly to like this album. Instead, I got out her ""You got to sin to be saved"" CD and remembered happier times."
3,"Nice try, Little Diver...","The Little Diver (fans know that this is Ms. McKee's nickname) makes a good try, but the cd is a bit cluttered. Also, she didn't record ""Jason and the Idea Box"", a song my band, Life's Hero, sent for her to record. Oh well, maybe on the Little Diver's next cd."
2,"Overproduction, Overproduced, Yikes!","I guess Jim Akin the producer of this project was so excited to finally get to do something that he made the biggest mistake that most young producers make. Put in everything but the kitchen sink! The overboard production takes away from Maria Mckee's beautiful voice, artistry, and mystic. True genius knows restraint and that's not demonstrated here. I guess he never heard ""less is more"", especially on his bass playing which totally takes center stage on this record. I'm a big fan of Maria's and think a different producer on this project would have really been a better choice. Some good songs, some great moments, if again you can hear past the ""notice me"" production. Don't get me wrong there are some great moments, but those are quite dirivitive of lots of obvious acts.Still worth a listen though!"
1,not my cup of tea,"To quote Kasey Kasem (about something else): Ponderous, man, ponderous. Over-produced, overly long tracks keep Maria McKee's long-awaited CD from settling into a groove. Instead, self-indulgent arrangements like ""Be My Joy"" and ""From Our TV Teens to the Tombs"" (eh?) defy listeners like me from getting through this CD. Me: I like the Maria McKee on the first Lone Justice Cd, ""If Love is A Red Dress"" and ""You Gotta Sin to Be Saved,"" don't like the second Lone Justice Cd and ""Life Is Sweet."" Does that sound like you? If so, I bet you won't like ""High Dive."" Doesn't sound like you ... dunno how you'll feel about this one. I didn't ""get"" those recordings, and I certainly don't understand this one..."
3,Uneven Effort,"""High Dive"" is an uneven effort, one where Maria McKee the singer greatly outshines Maria McKee the songwriter. As a singer, Maria is a great vocalist who packs emotional wallop. Her band on this CD does a decent job of giving her support. However, the lyrics to this CD strain and come off as just plain odd rather than effective or creative. Maria appears to need some strong guidance to rein in the material. The disc sounds much better when you don't pay attention what she's singing. The opener ""To the Open Spaces"" has a buoyant feel with a great sense of freedom. ""High Dive"" sounds like she was channeling Burt Bacharach with somber lyrics juxtaposed to the lush melody. ""Non Religious Building"" is a bizarre anthem to suicide. ""From Our T.V. Teens to the Tomb"" has a busy theatrical melody but somehow needs a plot to support the lyric. This set has grown on me with repeated listening, but is still an uneven effort with hidden charms."
3,"The Shift, an interesting view","I have read many books on the evolution of Earth and the difference of vibrations taking place. This is a fairly simple book, nice because it is simple, but leaves you a little hungry for more. Interesting if you are new to the subject."
4,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR...,"FASCINATING APPROACH, YET A BIT MORE TECHNICAL THAN NECESSARY. IT WAS EXACTLY WAS I WAS LOOKING FOR ON MY JOURNEY.THANKS...."
3,The Shift,Book was smaller than I expected for the price. Some interesting conccepts - not quite what I thought I was getting.
4,Simple explanation,"Owen has very simply put into words the easiest explanation of what is happening in these changing times. This is a very easy read with all of the data backed up by such best selling authors as Dr. Wayne Dyer, Neale Donald Walsch, Dr. Deepak Chopra and others.Owen Waters is certainly doing his part in helping to change and save the world. His website and Infinite Being group is growing and anyone involved in their own spiritual growth should definitely read this book"
5,The Spiritual Revolution,"I have had various spiritual experiences to date, but it wasn't until I read 'The Shift' that things really started to make sense for me!! Owen Waters has hit the nail on the head, this book will help navigate many people towards the new awareness....life's changing....we're changing....its just a matter of time!!!"
2,Olympus Stylus 750,"1) A view finder is a must! Cannot see the subject in the LCD screen in bright light and is totally worthless outdoors. (Olympus says to change the screen contrast. No measureable improvement.)2) Battery does not last long, especially if using the flash much.3) No 12V auto charger available.4) Exposure button pressure is too high increasing rate of shake, blur and out of focus.5) The price of the camera has dropped 50% in less than 4 months. Is this a testament to poor customer satisfaction?Sadly, the bad points outweigh some really fantastic features, e.g., 7.1 megapixels, 5X optical zoom, size, weight, etc.It's a bummer to have purchased a lemon. Nothing to do but move on. For now, it is back to Cannon for me."
1,I do not recommend this camera,"For the money (I paid about $300) and have been using in for about 6 months in a variety of situations, it is not a good deal. I bought it for the water resistancy, which is about the only good thing besides the size. The LCD is impossible to see in bright light. The icons on the buttons are wearing off already. In very bright light, there is often a white circle near the center of the photograph. I have a 2G card and shoot at high res. At this setting, I get 1163 photos. When I get to about 700 images, I get card error messages. Once I download the photos and re format the card, it was fine. I have used an Olympus C3000 for a long time. An excellent camera, just too bulky. I am so disappointed in this 780!"
1,outdoor photos over exposed,I owned a kodak- then a canon - and was happy with my photos- I bought this becuase of the greater zoom capacity - but the photos SUCK!!! the outdoor ones have a white glare to them - and in a multipurpose room -(at my grandson's promotion ceremony)- I could see nothing - too dark -I wish I had never bought this camera ( I paid $349)I readusted settings etc. - reloaded into a different import software programsStill BAD- do NOT BUYPs - my daughter bought their underwater one- and loves it -
3,A little tedious,"Randal Malone plays it straight in this one. The mask is a great idea and is obviously inspired by 1960's Black Sunday. The murders seem to drag this one down, I don't know how, but they do. Cute girls. There seems to be a whiny notion that every horror movie needs nudity, but as someone who has seen horror movies as far back as the 1910's I can tell you that story trumps nudity; sure. nudity is always welcome but I want a story, too; this movie has a story, a bit dirivative, yeah, and a little tedios to getting to its point, certainly, but it had a plot that hasn't been used to death. Fine B-Horror, just a bit monotonous."
1,Uniden will not repair this!,"I purchased this phone and it was defective. Amazon has been great to work with. They offered to let me return it ... but I decided to send it back to Uniden to get it repaired. They made me pay to ship it back and then sent me a bill for the repair and the cost to ship it back to me. After 30 minutes on hold I was told they would pay to ship it back to me, but would not cover the cost since it was refurbished. I only sent the item back because their customer service department told me they would fix it.I would NOT buy this or any Uniden product. Thank goodness Amazon is so easy to work with at least I'm not going to be stuck with a brand new phone that never worked."
3,"Simple language, good photos, well organized","I bought this book as a resource to address whether I wanted to keep a seahorse aquarium. The book is neatly organized and the pictures are glossy and bright. They are really the highlight of the book. The material is presented with simple language that appeals to those just starting this hobby. There is very little technical information: Aquarium design, filtration, or ecological considerations, so that is why I gave it an average rating. This book provides a nice overview of seahorses but you will need to consult more comprehensive sources if this is to become a serious hobby. Respectfully submitted, K."
2,asian x-men?,"It could be the worst tsui-hark's movies i've ever seen. I don't kno why, i'm sure he could make it better if he had more bugdet. The movie looks so cheesy, bad fx, bad make uo and bad acting, and bad dialog. The selling point of this movie probably is the action, however i found nothing interesting, it just similiar with other asian martial art movie. The story is not original, even i can say it is just asian version x-men, where you can also find wolferine, mistique, etc. I think Tsui-Hark might have lost his idea. Indeed, if you want to watch asian martial art movies that are directed by Tsui Hark, better you get these titles; once upon a time in china 1-4, swordmen 2, and black mask 1."
1,Worst ever!,THis movie is pure evil. Ive never been so bored in my life. THis was such a ridiculous piece of filmography. I cant believe I forced my eyelids open for this. This should be used as punishment for bad kids.
1,AMERICA'S CRITIC,I GOT THIS FOR XMAS PRALLY WORST GIFT I EVER GOT!!!! ITS LIKE POWER RANGERS LOW RENT TV SHOW MADE IN THE BACKWARD OF MY GRANDMA'S HOUSE HELL I TELL YOU WHAT GIVE ME A BUDGET I COULD DO INSAINLY BETTER IF YOU BUY THIS IT WILL BE A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT AND A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE GO CHECK OUT ANOTHER FLICK LIKE ONG BAK!!
3,Not what you might expect,"okay, i have watched this movie a couple of times, and i cannot disagree that it is terrible. however, i think it is one of those movies which is so utterly pitiful that it becomes comical.there really isn't any redeeming quality to this whole movie; acting, special effects, choreography, character development, plot, ect. - all bad.Thing is they are over the top bad, so when you watch it the first time don't go into it thinking that it will be some great martial arts movie like the first, otherwise you'll just be bitterly disappointed. Instead, you should watch this for the goofy action and ridiculous storyline, then its entertaining. I like to get a large group of friends together and watch bad movies like this to laugh sometimes."
5,A great terrible film to watch.,"If you love bad films, this one is a must. If you don't, don't bother reading this, just forget this film ever happened. Ok here is what happens; Black Mask dude doesn't like Goggle Guy. Goggle Guy doesn't like Blask Mask dude. They fight. People who couldn't make the grade for a WWC league appearance take hormone injections that make them into power-ranger monsters that fight Black Mask dude. Goggle guy is eventually defeated, after a great scene where he is hanging in the middle of a room by wires for god knows what reason. Queen of Porn leftovers Traci Lords makes the film all the funnier. Surreal, bizarre, awful. Enjoy."
5,Great read,"This book had me gripped from the start - you don't have to be a sailor to enjoy it. The historical sections are lively and interesting, and the accounts of the author's journey make you wish you were there. I particularly liked the account of his visit to Tikopia."
1,Dont buy it,"If you ever played top spin on the console, just stick with that, this portable verison sucks, the controls arent that responsive and it doesnt play like the console with the holding the button to charge your swing and etc. If you like tennis games and want to play on GBA then I suggest you play Mario tennis power tour, its really fun, tops spin 2 for gba is not"
5,interesting take on single life,"When I bought this book-I wasn't sure what to expect. I generally dislike romance related books, so I wasn't sure why I'd picked this up. But, the humor is genuinely funny. And after a few chapters, you also realize this is also a salvation story-I was engaged through the whole book. I try not to finish books too early to make them ""last""-but; I kept wanting to read more of this book & eagerly anticipating the sequels. The characters are quirky & deep at the same time. You'll be glad you picked this up."
5,A Flabbergasted Reader,I ran across this book purely by accident & was blown away by how up beat & happy it made me feel! I would recommend it for anyone looking for a lift in their day. Ray Blackston does a great job!
5,Loved It!,"Read this book as a fun summer roadtrip story, or open the treasure chest of clever prose, lush imagery, and valuable life lessons. Either way, you can't lose."
2,Beware - very preachy,"This harmless piece of fluff is ""Christian fiction"" disguised as a comedy. It fooled me and I bought it. As a non-church goer, this book had way too much preaching and spiritual discussion. If that's your thing, give it a shot, otherwise steer clear."
1,Wish I had read these reviews first...,"I picked up the book at a discount bookstore, but sure wish I had read these reviews first. The novel starts off pretty well, but loses steam as fast as it picks up its Christian-focused message. It's as if the author changed his plot mid-story from a summer fun fantasy story to a personal spiritual exploration. Perhaps the two could have blended better to create a more compelling story, but the end result lost me as a reader."
5,I'm flabbergasted by this fantastic story!,"I met Ray at a writer's conference this past April and bought his book as a way to return the favor of him being so kind and helpful to me. What a nice guy!Anyway, I was immediately surprised at the truth and freshness to his writing and style. I was blown away, really.I thought that it was a great, wholesome, escapism type of story, which I thoroughly enjoyed. But, then I got to the end and was blown away again by the beauty and deepness of the underlying message.I was touched in a surprising way by his faith and was reminded that God's will for my life is so much greater than anything I could plan for myself. If only I'll let God lead me. I actually cried.I put this book in my top five favorites. Wow.(...)"
4,Characters you'll miss,"This book is filled with wonderful characters that, when you close the book, you'll miss. The main character, Jay, comes of age when he takes a stock broker's job in Greenville, SC, and goes to church to meet women (not too uncommon, but difficult nonetheless). Three weekends later, he finds himself on a beach trip with fifty odd single Christians. Later, a chance event has him thinking about death and what comes after, and he finds that his Christian group has answers for more than just his loneliness.Some of his characterizations are a little trite (""the numericals"") and so is some of his dialogue (""Commas, please, Allie!""), but all in all the pages turn themselves and the characters are burned very clearly in your memory. I was left wanting to know each of them more, and wanting to know how it turned out. I miss Allie and Jay, and Steve and Lime Sherbet.I'll buy his next novel, and that' the true test, isn't it?"
4,Refreshing novel,"I am not much of a fiction reader, but picked it up and couldn't put it down. For anyone who has ever been in a Church youth group or a singles group, you can put yourself right into this story. Each character is quirky yet real. The author has a knack for writing like one thinks, without getting confusing. I look forward to his next book. This is a fun, entertaining read without too much fluff or too much preaching."
1,Flabbergasted is what happens when editors don't edit,"Shame on the editors at Baker Book House and Fleming Revell. Flabbergasted is what happens when editors don't edit and when they don't tell a novelist that he doesn't have enough material for a novel.When I saw that Blackston had the Christian dating and the so-called ""singles ministries"" scenes in his crosshairs I wanted to like this book. Trouble is, he never pulled the trigger. This is just another silly road trip book that could have been so much more. It's a novel with only enough plot and character development for a short story."
4,cute,"I liked the fresh angle of this book. Imagine this... a book from a man's perspective with almost no reference to sex or violence. (Unless you consider discussing impure thoughts or bloody head injuries, I suppose...)I've never read a book like this. I really liked it and I walked away wanting to smack Allie upside the head for her self-righteousness disguised as good-doing. I just wanted Jay to get somewhere besides holding hands with Allie. And I can't even believe I'm saying that about a Christian-themed story, but there you go."
4,syndrome x,"VERY INTERESTING BOOK, IF YOU WANT TO ALTER YOUR WELL BEING.VERY WELL WRITTEN, GO FOR IT."
4,Great understanding on insulin resistance and sound strategy,"I have type two diabetes and have found this book helpful. The diet in here matches the original diet I found works best when I first got diabetes II. I've been trying to steer from out of control sugars recently to back in control and this book has provided the insight necessary to start changing my diet back onto the right track. Also, I would recommend following the nutrient guidelines on antioxidants that the authors give. I would get ""needles"" from my polyneuropathy every time my sugars got high 200's and above. After I started taking vitamin E along with some other antioxidant supplements, the ""needles"" and ""burning"" have almost all gone away. (I have a mild case.) This book is a must read!!!!!!"
5,The best book I have ever read on nutrition! Ever!,"I had been struggling with understanding what sugar does to someone who is intolerant to sugar, and this book instantly got rid of all the mystery. I know what foods make me feel good, and which ones just dont sit right afterwards, and the common factor was always sugar or foods with a high glycemic index. As a healthy athlete, I wanted to learn the best fuel to put in my body, and I stick to this diet, with predictable results. What I really enjoyed about this book was the proactive approach to help me increase my energy, and to understand the supplements to take. I am now very mindful of high glycemic foods, and plainly just avoid them, to keep my mind, body and spirit operating at the optimum rate. Thanks for educating me!"
1,Diet is Totally Impractical and Unpalatable,"I thought the title of this book was intriguing and I also liked the explanation of Syndrome X. BUT, the diet part was ridiculous and impractical. Plus it didn't make any sense. Seems it was much too low in even the beneficial carbohydrates..I showed this to my nutritionist who really was up in arms. Too Bad."
2,Not a true flash drive,"This is not really a flash drive and Amazon should not be calling it one.Quite an interesting little device. Very small and weighing less than 2 ounces, and running at 4200 RPM. Has full USB 2.0 performance. The USB connector is quite fragile though. Made in two, four and six GB capacities, they cost over $100 back in 2006 or so. Obsolete now however, since true flash drives with higher capacity now available at very low prices.""Flash"" has a specific meaning. Flash drives contain only flash memory chips, and a flash drive does not contain a spinning hard disk. This device contains a spinning hard disk, not a flash memory chip. There is a difference in reliability."
2,Disappointed,"PROS: Looks great, seems sturdy, cheap.BUT, shoulder strap is permanently attached (wth) and NO space for documents or papers (not even one, unless you fold them). I understand wanting to keep it small, but literally they could have made the front pocket 1/2"" bigger and a file folder would likely fit.OK, so you don't want to carry ANY documents? No problem, get a SLEEVE instead of this hybrid sleeve messenger.The bag tries to be more than one thing and fails at both unfortunately. The bulk and stupidity of a non removable shoulder strap on a bag this size makes someone wanting the ultra compactness of a sleeve go that route, while anyone wanting space for at least ONE sheet of paper will need to look elsewhere.Really wanted to like this, but just not practical so cannot recommend."
2,Smaller than expected,"I have the 17"" CityGear Miami for my 17"" MacBook Pro, and love it, so when I got a MacBook Air I bought the CityGear Atlanta bag for it. No go. The bag seems well constructed (as I'd expect given my experience with the CityGear Miami), but the MacBook Air (which has a 13.3"" screen) is too wide to fit in the bag. Disappointing."
4,LOVE it!,"I also have the 12.1"" Dell laptop, and it fits quite nicely in this bag. When I first received it, I almost returned it because I thought it was just too small to be useful, but then I decided to give it a chance. While it's not large enough for taking on extended work trips, it's PERFECT for just back and forth to work. I have the CityGear Los Angeles case for traveling, and that one is just too big and bulky for me to carry just commuting, whereas this one is AWESOME. It fits my (small) purse, power cord, a few pens and pencils, and on the little key ring that's inside, I keep my flash drive and a monitor-cleaning cloth. It's been a great bag! I also only gave it 4 stars though for lack of a water bottle holder. It really wouldn't have been *that* difficult to fit one on. I solved that by getting a clip-on one to clip to the strap, but it's still somewhat awkward.But yeah, I'd totally buy this again."
4,Targus review,"The bag is worth a solid 4 stars in my opinion. The only quam I had with it was that even though it is designed for a 13.3 laptop I initially could barely get my new Macbook to fit. After a couple weeks it did get better and it is no longer a struggle to get the laptop in and out. I am thinking though that my new Macbook is pretty slim, and someone might find it nearly impossible to fit an older model (thicker) into the bag."
4,Don't miss this passionate romance.,"In 1864 during the Arizona Territory days, a young man disappeared into 'The Hoyo del Diablo Cavern (The Devil's Pit) never to be heard from again. The Indians say the cave is cursed but that didn't stop those who created what is now called the BioCave. A chance to be a member of the BioCave team could drive a person to do just about anything. At least that's what Liz Madison and Ethan Winslow are about to find out. When the team goes underground to live in the BioCave they experience something more frightening than the resident ghost. Nothing puts the chills down my back quicker than hearing my name and not knowing 'its' source. You will hold tight to your book and refuse to put it down until you know what 'it' is. The mixture of romance, ecological science and the paranormal makes for an explosive result."
5,Read the book before they make the movie!!,"SHAKER DAYS- from the title to the very end of the book, Don Terbush takes a creative and engaging look into the life of a young boy growing up in Southern California during the 30's. The relationship between Joe and his sister Katie unfolds with each turn of the page and takes you on a journey of love, heartache, and triumph. Once I began reading, I carried the book with me filling gaps in my day with the chronicle of Joe's ""coming of age"". This book is deeply moving, making you wipe away tears one moment, then smile the next. ""Caring"" is the tread Don uses to weave a beautiful tapestry which envelopes you with a feeling of contentment and satisfaction regarding the outcome of the characters you have come to know and love through the penning of the author. What a great movie this story would make!!"
1,Terrible,"I hate to rip on items, but this bag is awful. I wound up giving it away for nothing and buying a much nicer bag for less.Disregard the picture, this bag is not the well-constructed, rugged leather bag you think you see. It's light, flimsy and feels very cheap.The worst part is the main zipper that (allegedly) holds this bag closed, supposedly securing your valuable camera. I had this bag less than ONE week before the zipper quit holding. You know the deal, the teeth come apart and the zipper is hopelessly stuck in the middle. Tug it back and try again, same thing. Why, why, why do companies make products this poorly???Stay far away from this bag. I hate to give this type of review, but I got burned on this one. Don't make the same mistake."
1,"i could not get into the writing style, too odd","it was a poorly written book. i was so excited to read it, it sounded so good in the over view. it was disappointing to me, especially since i bought it in hardback"
4,Definitely one of Lee Morgan's better discs.,"I go hot and cold on Lee Morgan's music, but I thoroughly enjoyed this album. Some may consider it a bit light weight, but it will leave you with a smile on your face."
1,Don't buy it!,"Didn't work and it is also discontinued....However,they replaced it with another one (different model and much smaller.)"
2,Kinda disappointed,I bought this for my best friend as she loves the real life slots...of course she called to say thanks that it was cute but hoped I hadn't spent over $20.....
4,Great storage bag!,"I keep play balls for my grandchildren to kick around outside when they visit. I needed a way to store the balls when they were not in use. This bag is perfect! Easy to fill, and keeps the balls corralled until they are needed. It will also make it easy to take the balls outside and bring them in again. I did not give it five stars only because I have not had it long enough to comment on how well it holds up."
4,A decent quality gear bag...,"...but the slide buckle is a little flimsy. Bought it for my son's beach stuff and it all fits inside with ease. Overall, a great deal for the price."
5,Gischler on a roll ...,"When they won't let you (retire), they won't let you ... what you do, between making wine, you take a stand ... and when they throw something extra hot your way (albeit a hit woman), you load up the double-pump and make do ... Victor Gischler is one of the best around ... like his Edgar award nominated Gun Monkey's, Shotgun opera is no fluke of greatness.For my money consistency is what distinguishes the great ones from the chaff ... and Gischler never disappoints ... go read this baby soon."
2,Historically Important and Interesting Music...,"Unlike other reviewers, I have no problem with the fact that many of the tracks feature Charlie Poole's contemporaries. Arguably, these serve to highlight his stylistic innovations.However, the non-standard packaging is truly annoying. Unless they have very narrow musical interests, most people purchasing these CDs will have fairly large music collections. Although wonderfully written and informative, the way oversized booklet is doomed to be lost on a back shelf or perhaps in the dustbin of history. The oversized cardboard cigar box that replaces the standard jewel case is a cheesy gimmick that must either be enshrined or, more probably, thrown out. What you're left with is 3 CDs in paper sleeves that will become lost among your other CDs once they're no longer in the immediate rotation on your CD player. For these reasons, minus three stars from the five this compilation deserves."
3,Unusual approach to presentation,"The first volume of this 3 disc set contains some wonderful selections. The second and third volumes perform a laudable job of attempting to present influential or similar works by other artists that were reworked by Poole. However, it takes only a few examples to realize what an exceptional innovator Poole was. I quickly lost interest in hearing the extraneous works and found myself wanting more of Poole's performances. I already have a substantial collection of music from this era and found the presentation of the Poole material to be first rate, despite my lack of enthusiasm for CDs in general. In summary, this collection is a stretch for 3 CDs and I think only the first disc is truly worth purchasing for most people."
5,Like running a garbage can lid through a band saw...,"This CD is not my favorite Autechre album, but for some reason I cannot for the life of me get ""v-proc"" out of my head... I have had to play it once a week for the last few months to keep my sanity. Just for that this album deserves 5.But, there are other good songs on here too; unless you have ADD you can probably appreciate this album."
4,a style of its own,"This album is amazing. If you like the new autechre style then you should invest in this album. The sounds of each song progress into something else that gets twisted up, mangled, and re-tempo'd. A lot of people dislike this album because it does not have the accessable sounds such as Incunabula or Amber. People need to realize that artists like to explore new areas, and that is what autechre has done. This is a personal listening album, and it does take time to appreciate, don't expect to pop in the cd and expect to love it immediately, it could take a few weeks, but the album is genius. If you are new to autechre, don't get this first, get Incunabula or Tri Repetae++. My favorite on this album - 6IE.CR - just amazing."
4,Very good,"In terms of style, Draft lies somewhere between Confield and EP7. It is very progressive nonetheless and brilliant work. My two favorites are Draft and Confield. I like this direction.This is music to be understood. It is a 3D stereogram. It's a mouthful of jellybeans. After time, you will be able to pick out each flavor individually. Once you have the key - you gain the understanding of their other works."
5,Newest evolution of Autechre's sound...,"...is incredible! Autechre never seem to disappoint (even with confield). Standouts include: ""SURRIPERE"", ""THEME OF SUDDEN ROUNDABOUT"", and ""6IE.CR"" - especially ""SURRIPERE"", though; hands down one of the most unnerving, yet beautiful, pieces of music ever released. I highly recommend this CD to anyone fed up with the leftovers dished out to us by the CORPORATE World."
2,London is messing with their headz...,"I don't know what happened with these guys... Chiastic slide was the start of something new and interesting, but ever since then, it's been downhill from there. Seriously, they need to get in touch with their roots and dial back the chaos a bit. What made them enjoyable before was the BALANCE between melody and chaos. You could go on a sonic journey, from the delightfully subtle to overloading noise in the span of a few minutes, and it all made some kind of weird sense. One or two songs touch on this, but hopefully the next release will show more balance and less BS noodling and over-intellectualization."
2,Not as good as the Vault series...,"I went in to listening to this with somewhat high expectations, seeing as how Skinny Puppy released such a great Vault series and Autechre could no doubt kick their balls. Instead, all this consists of is a bunch of electronic instrumental music. It's not even good instrumental music, mostly just a bunch of noises. Atleast when Skinny Puppy were noisy, they had vocals. Ogre fails to make an appearance on this album and overall, it's a letdown. Hopefully the forthcoming limited edition Autechre Vault series will be better."
3,Dreaming versus dragging,"3 1/2It sounds like this highly influential IDM group, at this point in their career, approached building their tracks in two ways. Either embracing all discordant electronic elements- coming together to overpower the listener in robotic rapture, or consciously producing anti-rhythmic work at its core that felt more like theory-work then anything truly powerful. The album mixes these conflicting goals more smoothly then Autechre's previous, more clunky introduction into evolving fractures."
5,Yesterday and Forever,I read it in 2 hours and couldn't put the book down. I was hooked. I was sympathetic to Daniel's and Miranda's plights-and Sophie was a riot. At one point I nearly cried. You(Sandra)have a knack of getting your characters to show their true selves with words and deeds. Keep writing! Reading your books are great inspiration. Keep writing those wonderful books. They are great reads and I often read them again and again.
2,Don't Break the Carafe...,"...or you're screwed. Mine didn't leak like other reviewers have mentioned, but I broke mine and have been waiting over two months for a replacement. Delonghi is of little help. If any unsatisfied reviewers are ditching their coffeemaker I'll buy the carafe!!"
2,Please try something else.,"It does make a great cup of coffee and it looks good, so one star for each. However, the carafe is a waste of time. It's poorly designed and we were disguted with it within two weeks...and that was before the glued on top came unglued. Without the carafe there's no use for the coffee maker. We called DeLonghi for a replacement carafe and they informed us they were not yet available but they would call us when they were available. That was 4 months ago, and 4 months after we returned the coffee maker, and we still haven't heard from DeLonghi. I hated the swivel control center also. It looked out of place and the clock was virtually useless being on top of the control center. Unless you're looking directly down from above you can't read the clock. I will however give 5 stars to Amazon's handling of returns...but try a Krups coffee maker."
1,Worst coffee maker EVER!,"After purchasing this coffeemaker for Christmas I was very pleased...at first. After spilling coffee all over the place on the first pour I learned that you had to either pour REALLY fast or hold the top shut with your free hand. Annoying, but it did make a good tasting cup of coffee. After a couple of weeks water started leaking out of the reservoir. A few weeks later the red light started blinking constantly. Within two weeks after that it was completely dead. For the price this coffee maker is a complete rip-off. It really is as cheap as it looks. For me it was not even worth it to have it repaired. The people at Delonghi should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such an inferior product. I have their Retro toaster and I love it, but this coffee maker is pure junk."
1,spillage,"I bought this coffee maker and only used it 3x before deceiding to sell it in a yard sale for $5.00. Actually I should pay someone $5.00 to take it away. The seal around the lid and the glass pot is extremely poor. Every time you pour a cup of coffee it goes all over the counter, not in your cup! I missed placed the receipt so I'm stuck with it..."
1,"Great coffee-maker, terrible quality!","I bought this unit 3 months ago from Amazon. It is great looking, has great features, and makes great coffee. However, the quality is totally unacceptable, and customer service is deplorable. The top of the carafe came off after only one month. I called for a replacement, and they said I had to purchase another for $20 plus shipping. Ridiculous. Then the unit sprung a leak and soaked my counter top, warping it in the process.Overall a great design, but a terrible piece of equipment. Do not buy."
1,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,I read so many reviews on other makes & models of coffee makers and bought this one because of all the features. What a big mistake!!! I should have waited for the product to be reviewed. If you buy this expect water and coffee dripping out of your carafe everytime you pour. After only three weeks the seal inside of the carafe starting coming apart. After only a month of owning it the coffee maker would not turn off by itself and the programmable features would not work. So now we are stuck with an overpriced coffee maker that we have to unplug in order to get it to turn off. And no pot of coffee waiting for us in the morning. It makes me think twice before buying any DeLonghi appliance!! What a rip off!!
1,next garage sale to this goes.................,"ulgy, cheap and how did they ever get all those tones and textures of plastic ""chrome"" on one appliance. I feel like i should dye my hair blonde, paint my nails red and chew purple bubble gum whenever i'm near this thing. Its affect on one is really scary and makes Linda Blair in the Exorist look like an angel. Plastic shavings from the lid have accompanied several cups of lukewarm coffee. Yes,yes,yes the ever flashing red light and I could clean my entire house before the pot was filled. Total trash."
1,I'm just trying to help ya here.,"Yes, it makes good coffee. And in my experience it doesn't overflow as easily as most coffeemakers. I thought these were my only requirements. I was wrong.Everything about this thing is super cheap.The carafe is coming apart after 8 weeks, as mentioned elsewhere.The display barely works, as mentioned elsewhere. The red light blinks, as mentioned elsewhere, and indeed the only way to turn this thing on or off is by using the plug.Yes, it's impossible to pour a cup of coffee without getting coffee on the counter, as mentioned elsewhere. (I know, that sounds silly, but it's 99% true.)It only looks kool in a photo, or from greater than 10 feet away. Get close, you see nothing but cheap."
1,Bad coffee Maker,"I purchased this coffee maker and while it did make good coffee and was very easy to setup and use; it didn't last too long, only 2 months, I called the company and was told that I would have to take it to the service center in Dallas, I called the service center and was told that I could bring it in for service. This is the bad part, I live over 100 miles from the service center and I wouldn't drive to Dallas for $100. I ask if I could ship the coffee maker and was told by the service rep that they only took items brought to the center. I made the decision to purchase a Brun coffee maker and am very happy with my decision.I will not purchase another Delonghi product."
4,A Trip Indeed,"In addition to being my first Kitaro purchase, Astral Trip is still my favorite album by Japan's synth maestro. And though he's now become the doyen of new age propoganda, Astral Trip still has the ability to transport one almost literally to another dimension. Virtually every song on this album is worthwhile and a few (particularly ""By the Seaside,"" ""Soul of the Sea,"" Microcosmos"" and ""Endless Dreamy World"") are simply breathtaking excursions into the soul of the Buddah. The variety of instruments Kitaro uses on Astral Trip is also an indication of the experimental quality of his early work--quite different than his later work, which is mostly mood music for wealthy convalescent casualties of the acid wars."
2,you get what you pay for...,"First of all, there are no stripes, it is all over- patterned. The bag it was delivered in (super-saver shipping) looked like it had been run-over. It was all dirty and it smelled like cat urine. The set inside was clean, but there was threads comin out already, and it seemed cheaply made... it was very thin and not at all worth the retail price. If you are looking for a cheap comforter taht may wash once before coming apart, then this is for you. I sent it back as soon as i received it. Yuck!"
3,Good,"I am happy to have those. But I cannot say excellent. It is good for the price, to be frank I expected something more elegant."
4,Surprisingly Different,I have seen worse.A good attempt with some ok graphics.The story line might be a bit ancient or mythological when viewing.It somehow captures your attention you would want to see what happens next.Better attempts with better graphics would be forthcoming I hope.
1,Definitely different kind of movie mindset,"Good gawd this was bad. In a MST3K kind of way. I know India's bollywood produce way more pictures than American studio's, but 1) they do not know how to produce a good movie or 2) their tastes are very far removed than other cultures.The CGI was OK. Sci-Fi channel OK. The lead actress, Mallika Sherawat, was absolutely stunning. Bad actress, but amazingly beautiful.The other actors were OK, but still pretty flat. The directing and editing was horrendous. Long, long shots that should have been edited down. Very little dialogue (and in hindsight, that's a good thing). The story was, well I guess, a myth India is familiar with and make many assumptions for the viewer. Many times I had no idea what was going on or why. I am absolutely blown away, this had a bollywood dance scene thrown in. Why? I have no ****ing idea. Just a filler and weird. The dollar was good to watch the sexy snakewoman - Mallika"
2,Overdone,The Movie despite its good cast wasnt eyecatching in the least.but can be given a try if one watches it without any expectations.
1,Simply Misleading,"It's not that Chomskey's intellectual prowess is under attack in this review or even that his ability to think about complex issues concerning Capatalism and its destructive effect on humanity is just ""intellectual snobbery"". No,no its simply that...well...he's wrong. He's a neo-socialist and definitely an idealist and his arguments are a testament to the fact that he does not understand human nature, the intentions of James Madison, or the irrelevancy of Plato's political thought in modern America. (Not that Plato wasn't a brilliant philosopher and thinker. Chomskey's arguments and theories are just not very parsimonious and he assumes to much!)"
5,Can't wait to see it again!,"The person who wrote that ""The lead role was poorly acted"" just doesn't know a good act when they see it. I consider this one of, if not the finest performance by Sarandon, a talented actor. He played a double role, but really seemed to be two different people. It's been years since I saw it, but I never forgot how much I enjoyed it and thought Sarandon should have won an award. I saw the 1935 version on tv just last week, and it made me want to search for this version. I'm buying it today. Should my second viewing change my mind, I will leave a comment here."
3,READ THE BOOK FIRST,I have to read the book for an English class and I think that everyone should read the book before they watch the movie
3,not bad at all,This video is fine for understanding the basic issues of the French Revolution- I disagree with the above reviews and feel it is a decent follow up to a unit on the Revolution or the book itself. Of course its not as good as the book- movies rarely are!
5,A Tale of Two Cities DVD,I teach French and ESL and found this depiction of Charles Dickens' tale of the French Revolution an excellent addition to my personal video library.
5,great service,We used this movie to get a feel for the French Revolution while we were home schooling. It was very effective.
2,A Tale of Two Cities,"I was very dissappointed with with this film version and it just did not make the grade - the film is flawed, and the people are flat. I don""t get the feeling I got when watching the original version. Something is wrong...The story line is not right, the people in the roles are not right and therefore are not able to portray the right feelings/emotions. It was all flat and I did not beleive in the people I was watching. I'm sorry, but the best film adaptaton is the 1935 version and I think will always will be!"
2,"Yep, 1980-ish","The movie is OK, I suppose, if you read the book and want to now watch some images to go along with that book. And that is the crux of my criticism; given the dated production, one can only watch this movie and not partake in it.More specifically, compared to today's productions of Austen, Dickens, etc. from the BBC and elsewhere, this production is rather bland.The lines are delivered as if they were being read, passion is reserved to the level that one wonders if it exists that all. There is no heated exchange, no believable human interaction, the scenes are devoid of the dirt and chaos of reality.In total, compared to today's productions, there is no ""suspension of disbelief"".The best I can say about this production is perhaps it would have gotten four stars back in 1980 when he was released.For now, I'll keep it on a shelf while I live the most recent realistic renditions of Austin, Dickens, and the other classics.Regards,"
2,My $.02,"The first set was pretty cool. It really brought me back to my childhood days. However, this second set is a real let down. I'm not the kind of person who usually does this review stuff so I hope you take this seriously. The episodes provided in this latest 3 pack are some of the wussiest shows they could pick. They are very girlish (all the shows have one or more female joes or friends as the main protagonist). I'm not saying anything against females but rather, I spent my money for some gun fighting and action that the typical Joe stuff had. This is not that kind of a video set. If you have to have some more Joe videos, by all means get a copy of this. However, if you are like me and enjoy the action and excitement of the show, you may not enjoy this set very much at all."
3,Huh...,I suppose that this product would work well but I couldnt figure it out. I am not a professional installer but am handy around a car. The instructions werent very clear. I uninstalled this and my wife just uses seperate remotes for remote start and keyless entry.
3,"The book's alright, but could be better","When I've first read reviews about this book, I figured that I would achieve an abundance of information out of it. After purchasing and reading the book, I found that it does contain some basic information about the subject of psychic phenomena.However, reading this book would feel more like reading children's book to those who prefer intellectual reading. I guess this is why the series is called ""The Complete Idiot's Guide."" For all of those who know little or nothing about psychic phenomena and have trouble understanding other books that cover it, I would recommend this book."
5,THE reference book in its field.,"The integrity of this book is remarkable. Besides the clarity of its message and the humor with which it's delivered,what surprised me most was the way the science was treated -- cleanly and accurately. This is a singular accomplishment for a lay author writing for a wide audience. My guess is that ""Being Psychic"" will quickly become the preferred reference book for its subject. Congratulations to Robinson and her colleagues for giving us this important work."
1,A book that can only be appreciated by it's target audience.,"This book is loaded with enthusiastic endorsements for topics ranging from the highly dubious to the abjectly false. The authors offer us their uncritical acceptance of firewalking, Kirlian photography(as proof of auras), therapeutic touch and a host of other such frivolities as genuine paranormal phenomena. Praise is also given to obvious charlatans such as Uri Geller, Jeane Dixon, and the Fox sisters(admitted frauds). What can we expect next from these authors, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Purchasing the Brooklyn Bridge?"
4,GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA of PSYCHIC INFORMATION,"This book is chock full of information about all things Psychic/Intuitive. It is a great overview of many things and gives practice ideas to help the beginner. It is a great resource to have on your shelf. It takes the mystery out of intuition, which is a gift we all posess, and shows you how to begin to put it to use. Even if you just want to go to a psychic, this book will give you enough knowledge to make the right decision."
5,"fun, informative, properly cautious","I am wary of books purporting to reveal easy, instant knowledge of mysterious powers. I am especially wary of popular books on psychic development, because so many are filled with nonsense. This book is an exception. The title may ward off some potential readers, but that would be a pity, because this ""Idiot's Guide"" isn't. It's a fun, informative read. The scientific information is surprisingly up-to-date, the authors are properly cautious about many things psychic, and the exercises they offer are quite reasonable."
3,Not as Good as I Hoped,"I've read everything by the sisters writing as Perri O'Shaughnessy, and this story was not as good as past works. If you like this author though, I still feel the book is a worthy read. My expectations of the storyline were a little higher than what I was presented with. It also took a little longer for this story to grab hold of me, but it finally did. I definitely enjoyed seeing the other side of the gambling industry, and was quite taken with Jesse's and Kenny's individual plights. The Nina and Paul saga, however, is becoming annoying, which you'll see when you read it."
3,Disappointing beginning and only okay story,"I feel like I was set up after the ending of the last book when the rendezvous between Nina Reilly, lawyer extraordinaire and Paul von Wagonner, private investigator and white knight, was cut short by the new case in Writ of Execution. After keeping these two apart for so long and then finally having them see into each others hearts, I was looking forward to at least one night of no bickering. Unfortunately, that was never the intent of the Shaugnessy sisters. Even worse, the background characters, especially Sandy, Nina's secretary, were hardly in the story line at all. We were exposed to more of Reisner's dirty dealings, but what else is new. I will definitely wait for the next book to come out in paperback to see what happens to Paul and Nina in the next installment. I will never again waste that much money for that kind of disappointment."
4,Loved this book,"The characters seem like family after reading the previous Nina Rielly books. It's hard to put down but equally hard to finish, knowing it will be another year before the next one. It would be a plus to have the Nina-Paul thing make some progress. Are these two going to be chasing each other down a nursing room corridor in their wheelchairs?"
4,I adore this series,"Well, Nina and friends are back. I have reviewed quite a few of Perri Ò'Shaughnessy's books and in most cases have thoroughly enjoyed them. The main character, Nina, is a wonderful contrast of hard professional, soft motherly instinct and confused woman. Although I do enjoy Nina, what really blends this book for me is the thoroughly well presented legal battles in which Nina is involved.The author's have an excellent way of incorporating all of the characters into the plot. I, once again, am left wishing however that the son would figure more prominently in the story and that we could have SOME resolution on the Paul Nina front. Still though thoroughly enjoyable."
2,poorly writ,"as in their other works, the style is bumpy, the phrasing is fuzzy and the characters interact in facile and stereotypic ways. the setting, lake tahoe, and the plot, touching upon the psychology of gambling, remain sadly underexplored."
2,PLEASE READ- THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH MY BOOK,"My book does not include the appendix at the back. It stops right after chapter 8. I bought my book new on Amazon and it came in shrink wrap. It is not an international addition. I found at least one other classmate who had the same problem as me. If at all possible, please send me the pages from the back appendices."
2,Full of errors. There are better books.,This book is a terrible statistics book. It is full of inconsistancies and mistakes. Believe me there are much better books out there.
1,Terrible,"This was the assigned text for my class and the book is just awful. Examples are not informative and formulae are not clearly expressed. As everyone else has said, the answers in the back can be wrong. Steer clear of this book if possible and be advised otherwise that this book truly blows."
3,Many mistakes in the solutions.,"I am sure the book is decent, I tried using it but found the teachers lectures much less confusing. Unfortunately she assigned many problems from the book and many of the answers were incorrect making it difficult to be confident in your work. In addition some answers were just missing or mislabeled. More of a side note than a complaint they used the tables in appendix A to solve problems rather than the true values using a calculator which can create some confusion if you are unaware of this."
2,Crap,"It doesn't look like the one in the picture, and it's just plain garbage.-It doesn't fit on your ear well-It's cheaply constructed-Sound quality is garbageI could probably go on and on about the negatives, but I think you get the picture here. Don't buy this, get a wireless mic. You can pick up a wireless for less than 35 bucks now.-Kyle"
2,Is not what's seem!,"I buy it, because it cheap and I need a headset real bad. But what I got was different from the picture I saw, It was cheaply designed by madcatz, hard to put on and it hurt you hear, beacuse it was a hard plastic like a rock on your back-yard. It seem to work fine, but once you turn on the microphone, it will stay on forever, even if you don't talk it still turn on with a sound like this sssssssssssssssss.... You have turn on and off to stop the sound. You won't heard ssss... sound, but your online friend can heard it, it very annoying for them and they will complain about it and give you a bad-rep. Don't Buy it. Buy the microsoft one, but it won't last more than a year. To buy a good microphone is the one from old xbox, but you need to buy adapter for $10 more, buy it last very lost."
1,Beyond Crap,"This is anything but what is pictured. It is awful, extremely uncomfortable, and no refund is offered once you realize you've been had. I believe this seller doesn't need to be able to continue to sell on here. Anywhere else they would be legally liable for misrepresenting the product by picturing something they are not selling. Just wasted the money because the trash can is the only place sensible for this item."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I got this game at a great deal, and was still surprised at the bargain. It's difficult to find other card sets when you've completed your board set, so when I find one, I try to get it.I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, so I don't know a lot of the detailed questions. But it's still a fun family game, and a terrific Saturday night activity (just add pizza) for when you want to get away from the TV.The game pieces are quite intricate and the R2D2 random number generator is a hoot. My only complaint is that there are only four game pieces and there is no die to substitute for the sometimes-annoying R2 beeps. But you can just take those pieces from another game set. (I particularly like to use the card-holder from the Millennium Edition). All in all, great fun, but I wouldn't pay full price for it, even if it is a collectable."
3,Caselogic PMM-3 Medium Compact Camera Case (Black),"Overall, okay, but not enough padding to protect the screen which is why I purchased it. Screen on camera broke, so needed fairly thick padding for new camera. Wouldn't recommend if you need thick protection."
5,True to the ORIGINAL,"Excellent Table of Contents / Index.This book is recommended for reading BEFORE you do the 33 Day Consecration.It is St. Montfort's original writing and contains many profound insights.This is the same writing that Pope John Paul II wrote about in his biography, saying it formed his view of the Blessed Mother.Don't forget to see your priest on Day 34 to make the Consecration complete! =)"
1,No TRUTH in advertising here. Way too expensive.,"I spent $60 on this toy for my son. The box made it look like it had missiles and two other kinds of weapons it could fire. It didn't have any of these things. It also made it look like it could light up and make sounds, which it could not.$60 is too much to pay for a plastic box.BORING BORING BORING! Don't waste your money. My son didn't play with it for more than 15 minutes.Whatta Rip off."
4,"Cool toy - but no ""lights and sounds""","This megazords has three, well really four different modes. It is huge! But it doesn't have any lights and sounds as it says in the desciption, so don't order one thinking that it does."
2,Overpriced,"This toy is highly overpriced...it is not worth the money, especially since you have to purchase the other vehicles to go with it!"
1,What a disappointment!!!,"Before Christmas this was the only thing that my son would talk about wanting Santa to bring him. How exciting to see my little boy's face when Santa left it by the fire place for him. Within the first 10 minutes of playing with it the pieces started to pop off. It was a piece of trash!! My son was heart broken and still is. Not to mention the directions were too complicated for even an adult to figure out. We still do not know how it changes into the different things. Hopefully we can find something else for him, this one is going back to Toys R Us."
4,had a feeling that this guys would have to come out.,"well since me and my friend like to comapre america toys to their jap versions this toy by looking at it is better and more improved than dino thunder.this guy had to be released here just like all the others.all i can say is that this toy isnt like the DX dekabaserobo,almost the same to it which isnt that bad.least it can hold the delta runners in it which is pretty neat.this toy has a really improved paint job to it and much better quality to it than the mezadon which pissed me off since cephalo wasnt released here in america and mezadon had some really i mean really horrible paint job to it.yet bandai really has the time to make these toys better than they did last year and also with dekarangerrobo,dekabikerobo,and dekawingrobo all out now this is gonna be a real collector item when they all are gone and magiranger comming out next year hopefully bandai will continue to make the pr toys almost identical to their japanese couterparts."
3,Message to pizzant36 (Command Megazord),I saw your son did not like the delta command megazord. Can we help each other out? My son wants the megazord and yours does not play with his. Would you be interested in selling?
2,Very Disappointed.,I want to know why in the world I paid over $60.00 for something that does absolutely nothing but take up space in my son's room. (*And that was not including tax and shipping charges)I could have bought him at least 2 PS2 games instead.I cannot believe this was an EXCLUSIVE! WAL-MART would have sold this item for about $20-$25 bucks at the most.DO NOT BUY IT. It is only 2 weeks after Christmas and now it just sits in his room.Thanks for nothing TOYS R US!!Laura Carter
5,i wonder though...,"as you may hve read the command base mode holds the delta squad megazord, but beig a collector I must ask if it can hold both the delta sqad zords and the surpreme zords at the same time.I'm buying this for myself for x-mas and this is an issue i wold like to resolve before buying. other than that i cant see any bad point to buying this toy, it holds zords in it, as if their damaged and need repair, and forms a megazord to continue the fight! also, if it can hold all zords, excluding omega, then it could even swap battle strategies and throw out the supreme swat flyers!"
4,good introductory text with wide subject range,"This is a great book for those involved in materials science to review the basics quickly, but thoroughly enough. My college used the famous Callister introductory text for the introductory materials science course that engineering students are required to take. This book, in my opinion, rivals Callister as a good introductory text because not only does it cover the basic core topics of materials science, as Callister does, but goes into broader subjects and more modern topics, as well. When I search through the book for something specific, I often get side-tracked on another topic along the way because there is so much material covered."
4,Book Review,"This is a good book overall covering many areas of the science of solids. More specifically from the nuclear level through phase diagrams, crystallography, metals, chemical reactions and physical properties. It is recommended for people with a grounding in these areas and is good up to college level. It is also suitable for those (like me) who wish to refresh their memories. It has been well reviewed by at least one scientific journal that I have seen. A very good book."
2,It's ok.,"The book was delivered earlier than expected. But it is not really good because that book got a little bit dirty. I always keep my books clean, therefore that makes me disappointed though."
4,Who Owns The Land?,Easy read if you want a quick overview of the national events that imposed their policies and treaties in current day Israel. The author does not take sides but provides a simple chronological list of events. I recommend this book for anyone interested in Israeli - Palestinian issues.
2,Not very erotic,"That's why I ""rented"" it. To see beautiful, naked Thai women. The preview is them pillow fighting in lingerie. The ""movie"" is a lot of footage of Thailand, and very little nudity."
2,They said it was a travelogue.,"That's what it is. With some beautiful, young. Asian women. Plot, no. Acting , no. Cinematography, no. You decide."
2,Nice tour tape,"This movie has a lot of tour pictures, but that is about it. The music is annnoying, and the acting is poor at best. Saveyour money, I would not sugest it to anyone"
2,Do not waste your money,"This is just a terrible movie. The plot, if you want to call it anything, is very shaky, some porn movies have a better plot than this movie.If you like watching 3 girls go to a resort for a vacation, there has to be a better movie for that than this. If you like watching movies with lots of nude t&a;, this movie has so small of an amount, that it could almost pass for barely an r rating.the quality of video is grainy, the audio is very weak and overall, the movie is just a waste of time, money and even a waste to review."
3,Hot Thai women,This film is more like a photo shoot for three very beautiful Thai women againstsome nice background scenery. The three girls are all very pretty and take offtheir tops about every two minutes. This is dubbed into English with not much ofa plot but did I mention how hot the babes are?
1,Just three women,It's just a movie about three women in scantily clad clothing - it's not even a movie. Plus it's not even a documentary about Thailand.
5,"Rebus is at it again, irritating the powers above him.",I loved this book as I do all of the Ian Rankin books. This time John Rebus has to choose between right and wrong and identify which is which. He comes up with a surprising conclusion and makes it happen.
5,Guaranteed,"Just love all Rebus stories - everything about them appeals to me. The locations, the characters, the humour - it's all there."
4,Charming new version of the Ugly Duckling story,"Mrs. Hen yearns for a baby chick to love. To her delight, one day she discovers an egg in her garden and realizes now she can have a chick of her very own. She takes the egg home and sits on it as any good hen would and dreams of her little chick-to-be. Mrs. Hen's friends think she's crazy -- the egg is enormous and polka-dotted and they don't think it will ever hatch. For a long time, it doesn't. After a year or so of sitting on the egg, Mrs. Hen gets frustrated and jostles it, rolls it around, and hits it with a broom in an effort to get it to hatch, but with no luck. She decides to roll it back down the hill, where it cracks at the bottom and out comes her chick -- which turns out to be a dinosaur. She doesn't care that it looks funny for a chick -- she loves it anyway. The illustrations of Mrs. Hen, particularly of her excitement on finding the egg, are charming and full of life."
4,sylvania 32-inch tv,This is a nice tv. It works fine with my video games and I hook up my laptop to it to watch movies and shows. Its a nice size and has a good picture.
4,excllent primer on leadership,Andy Hill does an excellent job of applying Coach Wooden's winning philosophies to business and personal life. Makes an excellent gift to first-time managers.
5,Great read,Principles seem logical and common sense but the stories related by the author makes it an interesting and quick read
5,"Finally, Wooden's magic is nailed!","As a former UCLA basketballer under John Wooden, I have been waiting for someone to summarize his ""secrets."" In a quick and articulate read, Andy Hill has done it! Now when someone asks what made Wooden so great, I can tell them to read this book. Former Wooden players are honored to have played for him, but more importantly we implement his philosophy daily. I suppose many college athletes are influenced by their coaches, but everday in everything they do? Interesting, sitting on the bench and thinking he did little, Andy Hill now stands tall among the former Bruin hoopsters. Lynn Shackelford 67-69"
4,extreme hilarity,"I've only seen bits of episodes of survivor but this was still incredibly funny. The characters are all caricatures, but still somehow real (too real!) I think the authors manage to insult every stereotype (earth momma, michigan militia, corp exec. etc. etc.) but keep you reading. Oddly enough, most of this romp could be believable, given what goes on T.V. and that just makes it all funnier. Touch of romance and tenderness and hot monkey sex adds, well, maybe not balance, but perhaps variety.Read it and prepare to laugh!"
4,"A bully read, but patience helps....","Roosevelt does quite well to capture the essence of what went on during the period when the colonists began westward. The point made by the editor that it is indeed a wonder that this work was ever created at all is well taken when one considers Roosevelt's involvement with so much else in his life while he produced what, for the time, was a very scholarly opus.One must be patient with the narrative; it tends to be choppy. One must also be patient with, or at least understanding of, TR's view of the world and especially his notion of upon whom the greater glory of the westward expansion rests.All in all, it is seemingly a must read (as is the entire series) for anyone having either an interest in the history of this time, or an interest in TR and his works."
1,Yikes! - Mind your Equipment and your Clothes! - Bad QC,"Right out of the box, the strap loop was not sewn onto the bag, causing the strap to immediately fail and my equipment slamming to the GROUND!So I get a repalcement bag from Vidpro. They require a very healthy advanced payment in order to ship me a replacement. They have NONE in stock, so I have to wait a MONTH for the replacement to come.After being inconvenienced for a month not having a bag, the repalcement bag has a sharp tab jutting out from the strap buckle, TEARING my shirt!Apparently Vidpro has no effective product Quality Control and ineffective logistics to keep products in stock."
5,comfortable camping cot,After I went on my first camping trip. I want to purchase a camping cot to compare with the air mattress. I like the camping cot much better than the air mattress. It has a comforable two and half feet wide and longer than six feet in length. I tried to sleep on it overnight at home. When I turn it doesn't make noise like the air bed and doesn't bother the next person who share the tent with you. I am looking forward for my next camping trip to use the cot. I am highly recommend this product.
4,Good impresisions,"I am very impressed with this cot, I was looking for a simple and entry level cot for camping. I needed a lower model as I prefer steep angle tent walls and wanted to get the most for the room. The Byer is only inches off the ground, yet gave me great support (5-10 at 190lbs) so I have nothing in function to complain over.If I was to voice a concern, it is that a cover would be nice, instead of the velcro stips they use."
5,Very well made Allagash AL Camp Cot by Byer of Maine,"I purchased this cot with the intention of using it for ""tenting out"" as my grandchildren call it. (I certainly could not function if I slept on the ground.)In my opinion it's very well made and sturdy enough to accommodate most adults. It required quite a bit of strength to attach the legs, and the gripping tool enclosed was a big help. Those with limited arm/wrist strength should probably look for another model."
1,RIPPED!,I took this cot camping and it ripped on the first of 2 nights. I don't know if the one I received was defective? The reviews for this product were great but I am really disappointed.
3,Nothing special,"I'll make this quick. Not the best build quality, but for the price what would one expect. It was good until he middle section started to sag. Once that occurs, it will no longer support the lower back; hence, screwing your sleeping posture and many sore-back-mornings."
2,Weak support,We bought 2 two of these to use on an extended trip that including considerable overnight camping. The cots set up easily but my wife was not strong enough to insert the supports. The rating of 225 lbs. is too high. We both hit bottom with our hips and one began to rip its fabric. I'd say they are good for people under 150 lbs. We will use them for our grandchildren to sleep on.
3,works for kids,"My grandkids enjoyed sleeping on this cot. The 4-year-old and 6-year-old fought over getting to sleep on it. It is close to the floor and safe for them. However, for an adult it is not comfortable."
4,Good,"I have two of these cots that I use for camping with my Cub Scouts. They are nice because they fold up and store compactly and will keep you off the ground in case your tent gets flooded! Unlike some reviewers, I thought the cots are pretty easy to put together (I turn them upside down, place one leg of the bar in the hole nearest me, then pull the other leg into the corresponding hole) Like a couple of the other reviewers stated, the material does relax after use, and your rear will sink and hit the leg bars. Fortunately, I can scoot up or down a little on the cot so that this is avoided (I'm about 5'9"", I don't think someone 6'2"" could do so without their feet hanging off the edge)."
2,Defective - Not cut straight,"I didn't notice immediately since my 3 year old was sleeping on it, but after a few days I noticed that the entire cot was not square. The fabric was not cut parallel to the weave of the fabric. This causes the side beams to be slightly closer to each other which means the fabric is not stretched enough. As a result my 150lbs body touches the cross beams when I lay on it.I like the simple system. I like the fact that it is light weight and compact. But the design will only work if the fabric is cut straight. I'm going to return mine and try again."
5,Great 4 my tent,"I was looking to get up off the ground.. but read all the reviews of failed air mats extra pumps ect...(I've had a few in the past) This cot hasit all for me,good support EZ to erect (read the instructions) Perfect here in Florida, it will need a pad under the sleeping bag for hunting up north.After great consideration this was my sleeping solution."
4,Better than an air bed.,"It's not quite a 5 as the bars are a little short & you'll hit the arch of the middle bar as you sleep, Still, better than an air bed!"
1,not good at all,"This cot would be worse than sleeping on the ground,very flimsy to say the least.very low to the ground too."
3,Cot,"Pretty cheaply made in my opinion. The supports underneath are like a 6 GAGE ALUMINUM ROD. Great for the kids, but not so much adults."
2,not lightweights,"yeah, if I'd read the description carefully, I suppose I'd have known. but this cot is NOT a backpacking cot. It's way too large and heavy. it's basically the same as the larger version I have (army style aluminum cot), but without the legs. it's HEAVY and also quite large even when folded up. way too large to attach to a backpack. I didn't expect a super lightwight cot, but I did expect something a little smaller when folded.given what it is, I'd rather have the full height version!"
3,With reservations,"This cot is not for ""side sleepers"" over 200 lbs. I'm 6' 1"" & 210 lbs, and within 5 minutes of trying it out the center of one of the metal support legs was touching my hip. By ten minutes, the metal ridge was digging into my hip. If you are less than 220 lbs and sleep on your back this cot may be fine for you provided your physique is disbursed evenly and not in your mid section or rear. Be forewarned, the legs are difficult to insert into the frame and will bend/give a little during assembly. Start in the center and work your way out. This item is lightweight and easy to carry."
4,Camping Cots,"Once I was able to put them together they did perform excellent. In all honesty I think it was more frustrating dealing with the main frame posts than with the support brackets, and the fact that it was the first time but now that I know what I'm dealing with, I truly believe the next time around will be a lot easier (Tip: start in the middle and work your way to the ends)"
1,"oops, comfortable until it broke.","A comfortable cot, until a design flaw <side bars made of metal, not wood> made the wire support structures fail. I retured it. Not a lot of use before it failed."
5,js1234,I purchased this cot to go camping with my son's. Boy Scout Scout troop. This cot is AWESOME! EASY TO SET UP!! and take down. Very comfortable!
5,Do a nice job,"Good: relatively light and compact, simple to assemble, low profile, 5 inches wider than most other - more comfortable.Not so good: takes extra muscle to put the legs in the holes the first time, but not a big deal thereafter."
3,Not a big hit here.,The artwork was okay. Some upfront nudity. It did have a homemade feel and the cups suit should have stayed cups as opposed to dishes since there isn't a dish one among that suits illustrations. It is hard for me to connect to the imagery since it is about a people who lived in another time and place and the history of them seems so minor but for something differant and 'homemade' or 'handpainted' this deck will do nicely and itsn't your run of the mill standard deck.
1,igital Concepts PG-100/ESOSXT Delux Power Grip For Canon Rebel XT Digital Camera,"This item is high quality and well-built. It arrived very quickly from the dealer. However, I don't recommend it! The main problem is that it doesn't fit the Rebel XT Camera, so it is completely useless to me.Also, it comes from an associate Amazon dealer, not directly from Amazon. I will not order any more Canon, non-proprietary items from Amazon.com. Buyer beware!"
2,Great for the price,"It's a great product for the price, but if you are looking for a high end or professional use battery grip this will not cut it. This grip will best suit someone who is looking for extended battery life and not the features of a high end battery grip."
2,doesn't fit batteries made for camera,It does fit well with the 6 AA battery adapter which is cool. The factory batteries for the camera do not fit in the adapter. The batteries are 3 prong and smaller than the holder which is 2 prong. Not sure what happened there but it's a keeper because I can replace the AA batteries on the fly.
1,Don't bother!,"So the other reviews that state that you must do sanding are all true, and than it fits....but it's just a toy with which you will just waist your battery power. Fully charged pair of Canon batteries will last something like 10-15 exposures if you are not using flash, else you don't have a chance, just pull them in one at a time and they will do their job because they have their capacity. If you are using some great standard AA rechargeables, I use Eneloop by the way, than you can do something like 50-80 exposures depending on flash use, again this doesn't mean that the batteries are dead, they still have 90% power left. So at the end this toy report only if batteries are at least at 90% of their capacity, else the camera shuts down.The only pro fact....price, but even this it's deceiving because its luring you in buying a stupid useless product...so at the end....just save yourself the moment about being pissed off for such a crappy buy!"
4,Mrs,This item worked for me when I took out my camera for a long day taking many pictures. It was not too expensive to try it out.I would say on a scale of 10 it deserves a 9. It does the trick. I would have liked it better with a rechargable devise hookup. A solid battery in this form and plug in.
3,Needed more instructions,"This book has some good ideas and some not so good. I was disappointed that there was not more detail on how to complete the projects. The book is mostly good for ideas, but not good in telling how to use those ideas."
3,Beware! Not a hardcover,"I love this book and was excited to finally find a hardback version. However when I received it, it was in fact a paperback version. Maybe the price should have clued me in on the binding but I assumed that Amazon was being truthful in their description. I have never had a problem with Amazon before in their product descriptions. If you don't mind a paperback version, this book is great. However, don't buy this assuming you are getting a deal on a hardback version."
3,review,"It is pretty helpful book for guiding the solution, but needs more clear statements of mathematical expressions and conclusions."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Second revenge.Having disposed of his first target, Gersen is working as a sort of cop to improve his chances and learn new stuff. This leads to a mission that may involved Hekkus, his next chosen Demon Prince to bump off.This eventually leads him to track down the bizarre feudal style existence planet Hekkus has set up for himself, complete with barbaric entertainments. The Demon Prince has a surprise of his own, however.3.5 out of 5"
3,interesting re-working,"This single contains the re-worked version of the very odd song that David recorded with Tin Machine in 1989. It's an acoustic version. I think that the lyrics in ""I Can't Read"" are pretty good, but the music is weird. ""This is Not America"" is a song that David recorded in 1985 (?). It's better than ""I Can't Read"". I'd recommend this single to anyone who enjoys Tin Machine's version of ""I Can't Read""."
2,Attack of the Mutant Flies,"The script outrageously lifts the opening set up from "" The Big Chill"" until the swarm of mutant flies shows up and attacks the cast. Thats right MUTANT FLIES! The problem is that flies are not scary at all they do not have the shriek factor of spiders, scorpions or roaches. The terrible CGI effects do not help- there are a couple of effective suspense moments-but most of the action takes place in daylight which deminishes the scare factor."
1,Can't believe I bought it !!!,"I cannot believe I actually bought this DVD after reading everyones ratings ! lolI live in the uk and ordered it from Amazon.com... I put it on last night and fell asleep after 30 mins (can't believe I lasted that long).If you want a funny film buy Camp Blood or Killjoy (both are really bad films but contain bad acting), this film has good actors and tries to be dung and funny and it does not work, its just boring.Sorry to seem a bit of a killjoy myself but wouldn't want to see anyone step into the same trap as me, I do enjoy dung films but I have started to try and improve my collection as I have had enough ribbing from my mates for a bad collection, this is bad !I have Bloody Murder 2 on order ! Didn't realise it was related to Scream Bloody Murder (how thick of me!), can't wait to watch that !!!"
1,Does RAID work on killing DVD's too?,"Ha! Ha! Ha! (i'm really laughing, it's not sarcasm!)Maybe it's because i didn't pay to watch this movie (if that's what you wanna call it..a movie!) and my friend did! Ha! ha! HA!Okay, i'll try to be serious and tell you what to expect from this piece of garbage film...terrible acting, terrible story, the worst special effects i've seen since the 1980's , and what else...hmm..let me think...oh yes, 1 hour and a half of looking at your tv screen wondering ""What the hell is going on?""That's all for me, if this review doesn't convince you to not watch this movie, then nothing will..ENJOY this stupid bug film and when it's done, watch it again and again and again and again and...."
2,pink rangher,"ok guys. not for a second am i scared of this movie. we know kimberly can morph into pink ranger a nd win. but she won't? trying to preserve her secret identity apparently. very unrealistic. im watching it now. this movie is cheap. then again it is very ethnic. the suvtitles have many options, such as spanisch, thai, and chinese. so you could easily watch it with vega, sagat, or chun li, respectively. I was surprised at such feature items and therefore give it two stars, there doesn't seem to be a john character. yet. We miss you binzie come home safely from the peace summit with zack, trini, and tulio. over all a kind of boring movie just like clint howard's ""ticks""(co/starrin alfonso ribiero)ans gunnar""leather face"" hansen's nature-gone-awry-epic, ""mosquitot""Also if you do like this picture may i reccomend something? frogs with jada pinkett-smith."
2,GAG,Was it the video quality or something about the way this was filmed....ug ..Trying to watch the beginning...i taught i had my tv on the wrong channel..it really felt like i was watching a soap opera. Movie starts with a funeral...ug...fast foward. Then we get boring people talking...talking... ug. Then we get the flies and effects and horror........even that is not fun anymore due to the impact of the beginning.... Im shutting off the DVD..ahhh pain is ended.Ill try watching it again..but making sure to bypass the first 30 minutes...Sorry..i really could'nt finish this movie.
1,Merchandising Error!,"This company felt the need to put the picture of a super nintendo controller on its site so that when a buyer selects the item for purchase he/she is actually selecting a NES controller. As you can see this is a huge problem, it isnt that difficult to google a picture of a NES controller and post it rather than submitting a incorrect picture that could be construed as false advertisement."
1,don't buy,"i can't believe i paid 17 dollars for this piece of junksmells like 1 dollar fragrance from gas station and thereare hundreds of scratches on dice.it was supposed be a new item but it looks like ve~~~~rrrryold one. package was opened and actual package of the dice wasopened. i would feel better if the seller put that junk in awalmart plastic bag. if my friend gives it to me for free, i wouldthrow that away to the trash can. i put that on the dash board todayi couldn't even smell it. please don't buy it."
4,College bar blues,"Vintage Bryan Lee. If you get to New Orleans, see him live at the Old Absynthe.A blind man who feels the blues."
4,Theory of Dual Earth,"For a normal eye, our human limitations in every way prohibit such theorizing. However, if one looks at this from the Cosmic Truth, it may be possible. Just because we don't know it, can't see it or it is NOT on the internet, doesn't mean it's not true."
2,Crappy edition,"This book was poorly bound and printed. Looks like something done at home with a copier. The type is really bad, looks like it was done on a typewrier (an old typewrier!) No proper editing, layout etc. really not worth the money even if you are interested in the premise, (or just want a good chuckle)..Relies heavily on the discredited diary of Robert Byrd and has so many scientific inaccuracies that it is not really a good yarn. Nobody withj a brain could accualy believe this nonse3mse but it is interesting to read it and wonder if there are people so gullible."
3,Good information badly presented poorly written,"This book is, to me, filled with vital information, but was hard to read as it was very poorly written, disconnected and boring in its presentation. Otherwise, the information, as I said, is important for all of us living on the earth to know at this time of transition and awakening to what has been concealed from the main stream."
2,I Actually Read This All The Way Through!,"I had this book on my shelf for years before I finally bit the bullet and read it. It wasn't easy. This is one poorly written book. As anther reviewer points out, it is mainly the same sentence typed over and over again. Apparently Dr. Bernard believes the real way to make your case is to beat the reader senseless with the same statement, over and over. Well, it worked for the KGB in Russia. I'm not going to pretend that much of this book stayed with me. I've forgotten most of it. I'm just very proud that I had the self discipline to sit down and actually READ this awful thing from cover to cover. But hey, that's nothing. I read ""Melmoth the Wanderer"" all the way through TWICE! Beat That!"
1,A better moisturizer after shower!,"I don't know why the word, Miracl""! The only thing I can say about this is that it doesn't do a "" thing "" for the "" thing""! No good - stay away!"
1,Does not work,I try the cream and it did not work. It is a waste of money. I would not recommend this product
1,Don't waste your money,All this is is a lube that dries out quickly.Does nothing for the size or girth.You'ld be better off using regular skin moisterizer or good old soap and water.Not worth the $25.00 I spent on this useless stuff.
5,Great program for making cards,"Easy to use and features a nice selection of cards and other publishing projects. Used the program to make birthday cards, invitations. Good variety of graphics and fonts included."
5,MUST-HAVE for Embedded Engineers,"If like me you need to take control over the math library that comes with your compiler then this book is for you. Whether you need more speed, more reliability with a total understanding of what's going on inside your code this book is for you. It is definitely on my top-five for embedded engineering. This is pretty much the stuff they don't teach in university but makes a trememdous performance difference at the project level. Do yourself a favor and get this book, even if it's just for reference... you will need it soon!"
2,Math Toolkit for Real-Time Programming,"This book showed some good points. However I felt it is a little bit out of date. The author might know the contents earlier, but he released too late."
3,Good book but needs editing....,"I started reading the book and very soon realized that even though I was learning a few things about RDF, I was getting stuck with mismatch between text and graphical representation, and other editing problems that can and should be fixed... may be in a new release or in a revised printing. I am happy to have a book to read but by no means I am happy with the quality of presentation."
2,Incoherent rambling,Very disappointed. Tried to read the first few chapters multiple times. Still do not get the purpose for RDF.Sort of like looking up a word in the dictionary and having a recursive definition.
2,No Better on Second Read,"In June 2012, I re-read this book, copyrighted in 2003. When I first read Practical RDF in mid-2000's, I noticed inconsistencies among text, examples, and graphics that threw me for a loop. I've read the earlier reviews and these inconsistencies have thrown a number of other readers.I would, however, heartily recommend part of chapter 2 RDF: Heart and Soul, pages 14-21 (before author engages in URI). I less heartily recommend chapters 5 and 6, pages 83 - 131 on RDF vocabularies. The last 60%, Chapters 7 - 15, pages, 132 - 318, refer to old tools and the like. The book could be re-written & updated in a longish article.On a lighter side, I can confirm the author's last statement:Google still returns the author's article in response to the search terms""giant squid legends Nessie""."
3,Good book,"This is a fairly readable introduction to RDF - however, you will need an RDF Reference open while reading. My only complaint is not with the book but the nomenclature adopted by RDF. Some terms used in RDF are excellent, descriptive and contribute to understanding (e.g., subject-predicate-object). Other terms make simple concepts confusing (e.g. ""Striped"" syntax). RDF is not a new technology - it is an extremely interesting and useful technology that is handicapped by an needlessly ambiguous and unclear nomenclature.Bottom line - use [...] while reading or buy a supplemental reference."
3,Practical RDF,"This book seems to have it all there, but unfortunately I don't ""click"" with Powers' writing style.I had to read the initial chapters several times before I finally managed to get my head around the concepts.If I were asked to recommend a text, however, I would probably still suggest this one as I have not seen anything else better."
2,Not impressed,"The best photograph in the book was used for the cover. Many of the photos, as portraits, seem rather contrived. The 'techniques' are kind of old school, and frankly the author uses the same set-up again and again. I was disappointed in it as both a book of portraits and a book discussing technique."
3,so-so strategy guide,"I was rather disappointed in this strategy guide. There were numerous places where the book was just no help at all, particularly on the final level. Now, to be fair, some of this is due to repetitive level design on the part of the game's makers. Still, there were too many instances of the guide saying, more or less, ""Now go over a hill and find the thing and blow it up."" Every hill looks the same! Which one?!"
3,marley fan,"I have this exact same marley concert except on this on they just cut off some songs from the other cd from the same concert, so I just got the same cd i already own except this on is worse with sound in a way, if you get the BOB MARLEY and The Wailers Germany'80 its the same exact concert, except this has the full concert set, Dortmond Germany '80 is the same as Germany'80 so beware, one has better sound and more songs then the other and its the same concert. GERMANY'80 is the better one"
1,Very Poor Sound Quality,"I can't believe anyone would produce and/or sell such poor sounding recordings. What a waste of money! Sounds like they put a Bob Marley CD inside a cheap boombox and put the boom box in a garbage can, put the lid on the garbage can, lit a fatty and started recording!"
3,Love/ hate relationship,"I have no complaints with the sound that is delivered from these headphones. I do however have a complaint with the length of the cable and the lack of outside sound reduction. The problem I come across is that from the cable being so short that when I place my iPod into my pocket it pulls the buds out of my ears. This would not be a problem if I was 2 inches shorter, but I am not capable of getting shorter for my headphones. Also, they do reduce sound but not enough. I am in the library right now writing this and slightly hear the librarians 15 feet away having a discussion. My volume is set halfway up and they are trying to be quite. For each one of those complaints I deducted a star."
3,"Detailed, but too clinical for my tastes","These headphones have pretty good detail, and good bass, but the trebles are extrememely hot and the mids are almost missing. Even after letting them burn in for about 60 hours, the mids just were not there and the highs were still too hot. If you like very deep and dry sound earphones, these are the ones for you."
3,Audio Technica ATH-CK7,Certainly decent but not worth the money. Most of the other reviews I read on these earphones exceeded the experience I have had with them.
2,Disappointing...,"I've been using Sennheiser CX300's with my iPod for a while and just love the sound. Then, on an impulse I picked up a pair of ATH-CK7's, thinking that the good reviews and higher price would surely take me to an even higher level of audio enjoyment. How wrong I was. The first thing I noticed was the lack of power - compared to the powerful CX300's, these things have to be cranked way up to hear anything. Next, the bass - what bass? Very poor indeed, and the treble was annoyingly sibilant, too. Overall the sound is flat and thin. I thought it might just be a case of getting used to them, but after a couple of days nothing improves and I gave up. Thought it might be a problem getting a good seal, but nothing I tried would improve the poor sound, so now I'm back with my trusty Sennheisers. Should have stuck with them all along. I know tastes in sound vary, but I really cannot fathom why people rate these things so highly..."
4,very clear earphone,"I have used this athck7 earphone for about one year. Overall I am pleased with the sound quality of this device. It is very clear in high and mid range frequencies. The base is there but not heavy or muddy, even though it may not be the best. The biggest complaint, hence the 4 stars, I have is the static noise when moving the wire around my clothes. I tried but failed to eliminate it. Other than that, I am happy with it overall."
2,Fragile design,"These worked so well, except that at the slightest tug at the cord, the whole thing just completely snapped in two. The cord and wire are both extremely soft, so any accidental tug will probably break it. If they would only add some protection so that the cords aren't so fragile, this would be an amazing set of high-quality earphones."
1,Not for cars with headrest,These seat covers could not fit my regular sedan seats with headrests. Headrests are standard equipment for cars these days. This product is also very cheaply made and started to rip when I was installing it. I returned them.
3,Not what I expected,"This item does not have much ""control"" feeling to it. However, it does eliminate all lines which was mostly why I ordered it."
5,world war 2 fighters as deadly as they are fun,"This toy is very fun, but I had problems with the wings, because there under the fuslage they came off quite easly, other than that the only other porblem I had with it is the landing gear dosen't stay down as well as the mustangs, and the piolt has a little gun hostler witch I lost easly.Other than that this is a very fun toy with exelent detail. I think the plane is great for indor or outside play. with this your kids can learn the technology and history of the plane, at a good price too."
1,"Product is not as pictured and not as originally described,","I purchased this item for my young adult daughter as a Christmas gift. She lost her Super NES power cord on a move out of state. When I originally purchased this item, the product listing described it as a ""SNES AC Adapter"". What we received was an RF Adapter. The picture even showes it as a wall plug, but there is no wall plug on what I ordered. I did notice that the description of this product listing as since been updated, but now I am stuck with this because the only option on returns is ""replacement only"". I really don't need another wrong cable. I just wanted a wall plug for my daughter to be able to play here SNES. She's really homesick because she can't come home this Christmas."
1,WARNING: NOT THE PRODUCT PICTURED!,"Apparently, this item has changed. It is not longer a power cord as described and pictured. It is an RF adapter, which connects your system to the TV. DO NOT BUY looking for a power cord. You will still be disappointed and without your favorite classic system."
4,Great Adapter,"This adapter does just what it says. However, the title is a little misleading. It is not only a SNES adapter, but also a NES and Sega adapter. It will work with any of the three systems. It does tend to overheat a bit. However, it powers the SNES just fine. Because of the overheating and misleading name, I give the item four out of five stars."
2,Causes Green Lines on Screen (SNES),"I purchased this item to use to power my SNES unit. Unfortunately, when I went to play my favorite old games, there were large, blurry, green lines running down the screen. I thought the problem was with my RCA cables. I searched online and found out that these ""aftermarket"" AC adapters cause this. It DID power the unit, at the cost of obnoxious green lines. Buy the Nintendo brand power source, not this one!"
1,Didn't last long.,"I have had one from thermos brand so was hesitating to buy this one. It perfectly works well. My tea stays hot for upto 9 hours. Haven't used beyond that time so maybe it works for 12 hours as the label says. Pouring is very easy and safe as it doesn't let spill.Update: 05/24/2012After using it for almost an year, it started acting weird. When I would wash it after using it for tea, dirty water would keep coming no matter how much I would rinse it. It was driving me nuts. Eventually I discovered that the content was leaking into the vaccum space. I realized there was corrosion in the bottom which I had been thinking was dried stains. Thats why the trapped left over tea would leak back to contaminate the rinsing water through the corrosive holes. Obviously its of no use anymore. Very disappointed."
3,You get what you pay for,"For a little over $10, when I bought it in June 2011, not bad value for what you get. It just recently developed a leak which I can only determine is due to the rubber gasket having gone past its useful life. Too bad you cannot just get a replacement gasket, because it does do a good job of keeping my coffee steaming hot till I'm ready for that second cup.It was good for what I needed it for when I bought it, but I think I'll try a different model/manufacture this go around to see if I can't get a little more life out of the next one."
3,Size is not accurate,"The description says it's 2.5 inches but it is more like 2.75 inches.I am trying to fit this into my backpack side pocket but with the extra .25 inches, it would not fit.But overall, it is well built."
3,Average...,"The case fits well, has a good texture and protects the sides and back nicely. It does make it slightly more difficult to adjust the volume as it's tough to feel the buttons on the side. I also seem to accidentally turn it off more frequently as the skin is very close to the power button. My biggest complaints are how long it took to ship (said ""delivery in 3 to 5 days - actual was 9) and the case detracts from the overall appearance of the iPhone. Overall, decent case."
4,Great fit,"Great fit for my iPhone 4. The material is perfect to prevent slipping yet it is smooth. I don't give it five stars because it only has the back camera, the mute switch and head set openings. I wish the screen lock and volume areas would be opened too."
4,great,"3 year old daughter loves it.. and it has a subtle message about the pitfalls of procrastinating... good illustattions, nice rhyme."
3,An easy book to read,"The book A Tackle without a Team by Matt Christopher and Margaret Sanfilippo is a sports and a little mystery book. This book is about a boy who loves and plays football and gets kicked off his team for marijuana found in his duffel bag. And now he tries to find the person who set him up. The main character, Scott, is a thirteen-year-old boy. He is so nice to everyone, so that's why he can't understand why someone would want to frame him. My opinion about the ending it was good but what happened was expected. I recommend this book to anyone who doesn't like to read very long books. I think someone who likes and understands football would enjoy this book."
4,A must read,"A perfect balance of heart breaking and heart warming. This book has all the elements required of good fiction; sincerity, humor, and insight. A must read."
4,Seminal work at a vintage concert,"Brubeck's quartet had been in full swing for several years when they played this set at Newport. The band is tight, the sound is great, and everyone is swinging.Desmond's solo, especially his blues on ""Things Ain't"" have been considered some of his best. In fact, it was later transcribed by Luckey ... one of only 5 solos of that era that Luckey chose to transcribe to illustrate Desmond's style to future alto players.Sound is good in this recording to, having been remastered for this release."
4,Concept version.,"Once again, Pocket Songs took the lead in creating this disc, only to have Frank Wildhorn change the musical when it went to Broadway.This version is based on the Concept/Pre-Broadway run. Some of the music was not changed at all, but ""Where's the Girl"" is vastly more powerful on the Broadway version.Orchestration is good. Personally, I recommend ordering this disc in combination with the Broadway version."
5,Still Rockin,"I've recently dug out my massive lp album collection, and listened to ""Rockin"" just today. It is still in my all time top ten favorites, out of thousands. Nashville Sneakers is a real classic. My daughter's friend was here, a hard core rap/metal fan, and heard Nashville, and started snapping his fingers. He thought it was a catchy tune, so to me, that speaks volumes. I agree with the other reviewer, a sealed lp would be much better than the mess of the cd. They should have remastered it."
4,Undiscovered Gem,"I bought this on vinyl in the late 70's. It was in the discount bin and being a Guess Who fan I figured $1.99 was worth risking. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is a terrific album. Unfortunately there are no ""top 10"" hit type songs on it so the unwashed masses passed it by. For fans of good music who would rather listen to something that they havent heard on the radio a million times this is an excellent buy."
5,Guess Who at There Best,I own this recording on vinyl.Have an engi.friend who put it on CD for me.Anyone want a copy?One of my favorites from the 70's.
5,Got it for my mom...,"Everytime my mom comes to visit me she loves doing the crossword puzzles in my TV Guide's. So, I got her this for Mother's Day."
4,Mulit-layered horror from a master horror writer,"Rick Hautala never ceases to amaze me. Shades of Night is more than just a simple ghost stary, so much more. Hautala has the enviable gift of being able to place the reader in a shared intense emotional experience with his characters. The reader feels and fears for their plight. This is one of his best. An excellent book from an excellent writer. Recommended."
3,Overwhelming,"I think the ""Beginning"" part of the title should be removed. Having minimal Java experience I purchased the book with intentions of fortifying my Java knowledge. But after chapter 3 it became overwhelmingly detailed and extremely math intensive. Nearly every example (or ""Try it out"" code)involved some sort of mathematics. I understand math to be an extremely integral part of programming but the examples were a bit much for the beginner. The layout and explanations were great (had you been exposed to OOP and programming in general before)but for the beginner, it can be very frustrating. After reading the first 6 chapters 8 times, I've learned quite a bit, but wish I'd used the time more effectively with another publication. I'll hang onto the book until I've reached that level because I believe it will be a superior reference source in the future. Excellent book but too much for the Java beginner."
5,An excellent Java programming book...,"Before reading this book I had no idea of what Java really was or how to write one line of code. I am currently taking Java in school and this book simply blows away the book we are using in school. This is the perfect book to learn Java from. The first part of the book covers the syntax in great detail. This is a necessity for any beginners book but the author explains it in an easy to understand way. The book then goes on to touch on all of the important aspects of the Java language, such as classes, threads, components, file handling and database access. The author doesn't assume that you know Java but does assume that you've programmed before in another language or are at least familiar with another one. If you are looking to learn how to program this book isn't for you but if you are familiar with programming and want to know what's Java all about definitely buy this book. Worth a buy!"
4,"Great book, but could be better","I am new to Java and object oriented programming (OOP). Chapters 1-4 were excellent, providing clear detailed explanations of every example -a real confidence builder. But on Chapter 5, ""Defining Classes"" the author fumbled, which is a shame because classes are fundamental to OOP. He failed to adequately explain ""Final"" class constructors, and his example of Packages did not work, and seemed out of place. The end of the chapter left me a bit bewildered. I think he should have broken this chapter into two or three separate chapters to really get the reader comfortable with classes.That being said, I still highly recommend this book. I just hope he will take some time to work on chap. 5 for his next revision."
2,Boring and abstract examples...,"The book looks good but it is clear that the author is not a Java programmer but rather just an academic. What I mean by that statement is that he presents JAVA as you would expect to view in a lab. So we have lots of mathematical equations to illustrate concepts instead some 'real world' examples. This may not sound too bad, and I guess it isn't if you are interested in learning Java to teach it, or if you are already well versed in OO concepts but if you want to learn the real world use of JAVA avoid this book or wait until Ivor actually uses JAVA to write a commercial appication for a client! The book reeks of soemone who never actually used the language in real work.Stefan"
1,Do not buy this book,"This book is horribly written. I plan on burning it when my java class is finished. Chapters 8, 9, and 10 are exceptionally bad. They cover file io, and it tells you how to instantiate a class, but not how to use it. Amid the maze and jumble of words, some have been able to glean a meaning from the examples he's given. Most of us weren't so lucky. Rest in peace, Java class.. rest in peace.More than 2/3 my java class is failing because the book isn't worth the pages it's printed on. He could not have chosen a more obtuse way of wording things."
3,Beginning Java,This book is great if you have programming experience in one language or another. Knowing C or C++ is a big help with this book. It starts out slow then move very fast. Deffinatly not for a beginner.
2,Don't know why this book got 5 stars,"Seriously, As a Sun Certified Java Programmer, I don't recommend this book. I don't know what it is with the author, but he seems to love to write code that computes primes.A good book is one that is informative as well as explanative and easy to follow. Most of this book is easy to follow, but the problem is that it doen't take you anywhere.Not much to be learned about the language and the rules of Java from this book as a beginners book should concentrate on.The author writes code and explains 'Heres how it works', with an explanation not easy to understand.It seems like a modified version of the Deitel, Java How to Program book.Sybex or better yet Addison Wesley have some very good introductory Java books that may be a much wiser choice."
2,Mr. Sandman wrote this book...,"It is not the sheer amount of pages that makes this book an efficient sleeping-pill, nor the sometimes unexiting programming-language Java. It is the remarkably unpedagoghical way that Horton presents that puts your lights out.I wish I could say that the book is atleast a good reference, but since the code is so entangled in the text and the subjects so badly explained, I would be lying."
2,Lack of motivating examples,"The title of this book is misnamed. It should be called ""Growing Old With Java."" I believe the first programming example where you might input your own data is somewhere near page 370. This is fine if yu're interest is piqued by the intricacies of function scope, data allocation, and polymorphism-- but what of programming? What of INTEREST? JAVA FOR THE WOULD-BE EXPERT: DYING OF OLD AGE BEFORE ANYTHING PRACTICAL IS SAID. By Ivor Horton. This book makes an excellent doorstop or instrument to break a window in case of a fire."
2,Ivor : master of polysyllabic babble.,"Ivor Horton is probably a great mathematician , but he is not a great teacher.He starts of well , but quickly gets bogged down in prime numbers.A Student would benefit far more from a ""real world"" example ,than from an enigmatic one.The book comes to a grinding halt , when Ivor tries his hand on ""utility classes"". Full of messy ""try it out"" examples and bad programming habits (excessive use of the static variable , because he programs a lot in the ""main"" method), this book will only satisfy programmers with previous experience , who are willing to put up with Ivor's sence of humor.A word on ratings , ""*****"" should be reserved for books of extraodinary quality and this book does not fit the bill , by ANY measure. Most user ratings are grossly inflated, making them useless."
3,Book is NOT for beginners with no programming experience,"I rated this book a 3 because I believe the title is deceptive. I usually learn things, such as software programs, quite easily but when it came to this book about Java programming, I simply could not grasp what it was saying. My conclusion is that it is for people with programming experience just starting with Java, not beginners.Then I read the Sun Microystems' The Java Tutorial, 3rd Edition -what a relief! My brain is still functioning!!I recommend that anyone without some programming experience start with the Sun Tutorial, then go with Beginning Java 2 if you want to become a Java Guru. I can now see that this (Beginning Java 2) is actually a great book - I just wish the title had not lead me to think it is for beginners. I shudder to think how complicated one of his books on Advanced Java would be."
2,Page 600 and ready for the dumpster!,"""Keep it simple stupid"" is the mantra for most experienced instructors. Horton seem to take an opposite approach. The thing that bothers me most about this book is the examples. Some of them can span over several chapters with Horton making tweeks to code fragments as you go. If you would like to step through the code, you're in for a major page flipping session. So what should have been a simple 5 minute explanation, turns into a two hour ordeal."
1,Misses the whole point,"As with his other books Beginning Java2 and his Learning Visual C++ his books miss the mark as a good tutorial or a reference guide. I am sure Mr. Horton is an excellent programmer, but the code examples are to spread out and incomplete. I do not want to see how he solves a problem but would rather he imparts the neccessary information for me to be able solve the problem using the language. So instead of wasting $40.00 goto the sun site and use their tutorial for free and then get the Java core books(available at Amazon). You will find this a much more rewarding experience, and save some space on your book shelfs because this is where this book will end up collecting dust."
1,Bad Bad Bad for Mac OS,"This Book does NOT respect the Mac OS... it s too Abstract... No CD... No Solutions for its exercices... it does Not discuss several Operating systems ... More than 20 monthes in learning java by it... But : i have NO Power to write a convinient code in my OS... for (int i=0; i<BeginningJava2.length; i++) System.out.println("" This book is very "" + (ivor[i].RespectMacOS( ) ? ""Nice "" : ""BAD "") + ""work ""); return;DO NOT BUY THIS BAD BOOK"
5,A very nice book,"The author has covered almost all the important features of core Java. The contents can be easily digested by beginners. Programming concepts, Object-Oriented principles and the recent entrants into Java have been meticulously depicted in this book apart from a nice introduction to Java in the beginning. The interesting and valuable subjects such as Swing, I/O and JDBC have occupied a major portion of the book."
2,Too consusing for a learning text,The book tells you too many things you can do but shouldn't do and not enough of what you should do. It leaves you wondering what way is the right way. It should tell me what to do and why and leave it at that. The examples he uses are not helpful and would be easier to understand if they were real-world. He even makes simple things such as variable definitions and casting complex. The book is so thick because over half of it is there to confuse you instead of getting to the point.
2,Hard to understand writing style,"The book is comprehensive and explains things in detail however, the writing style is very hard to understand. I found it hard to stay awake while trying to decipher the many, many run-on sentences. In order to understand what this author was trying to say, I finally had to supplement this book with the Java tutorial found on Sun's website."
2,Two And A Half Stars - Disappointing.,"I start with the premise that I am experiencing a recent loss and have lost many people in my life over the years. When they label that this is from the 'History' Channel - they aren't kidding, almost Nothing about current experiences and anything other that pure relegious reinforcement - if you are already convinced and locked into your faith of the afterlife. Lots of babble about what releigious leader - name and so forth of who came up with which concept. A child who saw the otherside from a near-death experience is inspirational - they go a bit into the angle of terrorists and If they go to Heaven (too much time spent on them).I also bought and watched the Barbara Walters Special (DVD) on Heaven - and it was less disappointing than this one. Still looking for something deeper and clearer - on a pure spiritual level.Sincerely, Scott M."
2,"Entertaining, at best...","If you've read any of Douglas's non fiction work, you will be really let down by this book. I almost hate to admit that, but it's true. He covers all of the bases and the story isn't too bad, but all of it is way too predictable. There's no mystery in this book at all! The reader has if figured from the beginning. If you are a fan of Douglas's previous works, you probably won't like this book."
2,Predictable and Uninventive,"In this highly touted collaboration between author Mark Olshaker and former FBI profiler John Douglas, the storyline seems secondary to the ruminations of a former career-focused criminologist. While the information that the authors impart in telling this story is somewhat engaging, the language used felt flat and unimaginative. Even the emotional makeup of the lead characters, Jake Donovan and his supporting crew, seemed as if they were filtered through the same electronic surveillance devices used by the Agency in gathering evidence. Had the story been told with more dynamic flair for the material, it would not have resembled a walk through a garden papered with cut-out impressions of real flowers. The ideas were intriguing, but not enough to carry the idea through to a satisfying end. It is as if this book exists primarily to cash in on the popularity of the science of profiling, as done so well in ""The Silence of the Lambs""."
5,A Long-time Douglas Fan,"This book was great. Typical Douglas, keeping you tense all the way through. Seemingly autobiographical, the plot is very real and beleiveable because it's backed up with actual cases and methods and behavioral models. Only an author with the experience Douglas has could compile such a suspensefula and real story.If you've ever enjoyed books about crime and behavior, read this book."
1,Disappointing,"An interesting story, but terrible writing. Disjointed, jumps around chronologically like a kid with ADD, and generally writes like a modern academic. Interspersed with politically correct garbage projecting 21st century anxieties about Halley's attitude to the poor and everything else. A particularly egregious anachronism is the author's reference to the position of Astronomer Royal as Halley's ""dream job"" - a grating reminder of the author's inappropriate use of flip modernisms at every opportunity.Worth plowing through if you are interested in the era - just hold your nose and ignore the clumsy and graceless writing. The author seems to have done the necessary research - unfortunately the facts are sprayed around randomly like the stuff on the walls of a casual restaurant. The editor and the people who read the book before publication should all go into another line of work."
4,Super cute book.,"I was looking for a light, enjoyable read and I got more than expected. It was a light read but also well, written and the characters were well -developed. Although some people may find the email only approach to this book annoying, I thought it was an interesting approach."
3,hated the format,i thought the email format to be too choppy. i couldnt get into the story. i felt like i was at a tennis match.
3,I perfer The Mediator...,"When I first got my kindle I accidently ordered this book. I got it for free so no biggy. :) (lucky me. My mom would`ve killed me)I have to say though It isnt one of Meg Cabot`s greatest. First off it was emails all the way through. These emails were not very organized either. I was like wait why is Amy Jenkins (You`ll know if you read.) emailing John, and turns out she was`nt. :P I got very confused through the whole book. But besides that it was OKay. I still perfer The Mediator. :) Best Meg Cabot series EVER!"
3,its ok...,"I liked the story, but I was constantly annoyed with the format of the book. The story is told through emails to/from the different characters. I've read some of Meg Cabot's other books and the way this book was written was definately a disapointment."
4,Funny & Cute,"I thought this book was really cute and funny. I actually laughed outloud at several points. If you're looking for a light,easy, breezy read...this this book will be good for you."
2,Slow,"Melissa was just an average gossip reporter for a NYC newspaper looking for love in all the wrong places. Fortunately her elderly next door neighbor was attacked in her home and left for Mel to find unconscious and barely breathing. Mel, being the kind, neighborly girl she is, took to taking care of the woman's pets and set to getting in contact with her only living relative. Her heinous, photographer nephew, Max. After hearing of his aunt's accident, Max decided it was more important to spend a few weeks in Florida with a supermodel. In his place, he sent an old college friend who owed him a favor. John Trent, a trust fund millionaire, was called in to stay at Max's house and pretend to be Max. After spending time together Mel and ""Max"" begin to fall i love, creating quite a mix up. All in all it's a cute book, but I hate that the entire book consists of correspondance through emails!"
1,Just couldn't get into it...,"I just couldn't get into this book. I kept reading and reading until I could read no more. The entire book takes place in email format...emails from the main character's friends, co-workers, boss, etc. Maybe it gets better as it goes on but I couldn't get more than 25% through before I had to put it down."
1,"""Friends"" and ""Sex & the City"" meets BAD WRITING","I wish I could say that this was a really great book and Meg Cabot has done it once again, but I can't.Melissa is the Gossip columnist for New York Chronicle. She lives in Manhattan and one day she finds that her next door neighbor has been hit on the head and is unconcious in her apartment. While her neighbor, Helen, is in a coma at the hospital, Mel takes up the responsibility for Helen's animals, which she clearly does NOT have to do. Then she contacts Helen's famous photographer nephew. Instead of the nephew, someone posing as the nephew shows up to take care of the animals.This whole book is written through emails, which gets EXTREMELY irritating to read.Who actually emails anyone this much? PUH-LEEZ. This book is dumb and just not written well.All of Cabot's other books are great. NOT this one.~Atalanta"
1,KELLY KELLY KELLY,LOVE THE GIRL ON REGIS BUT DO YOU THINK MAYBE ONCE SHE CAN REVIEW A GOOD BOOK... THIS IS BORING BORING BORING..
2,"Predictable, silly, a waste of time","The Boy Next Door is just another chick-lit novel, a genre I am not a fan of, but I wanted to read something light and romantic for a change. The only thing that separates this book from many, many other similar novels is that it's written entirely as emails sent between the main characters. It is an annoying gimmick, but the author does a fair job of making it work, despite the fact that most people would (hopefully) never dish about their sex life using their company email address. This book is completely predictable and pretty much a complete waste of time. Cabot should stick to writing Young Adult novels. If you want a QUALITY romantic read, I recommend either Bridget Jones Diary or Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"Great book, and a great ending! Hated it to see it end. Even though the book is ONLY emails, I LOVED IT SO MUCH! MUST READ!"
5,Original and Fun!,Loved the way it was written as a series of e-mails. It was refreshingly different. Couldn't put it down.
3,Cute....,"but predicitable. I really don't write reviews for books that I don't enjoy, so I did enjoy this book. I just didn't love it. It's a great, easy read with likeable, funny characters and lots of humor. The format is in email style which is a nice change of pace. Get this book if you are looking for a funny, light beach read. If you are looking for literary genious.. well, look somewhere else. But hey, what's wrong with having some fun once in awhile?"
3,"Entertaining, but unnecessarily long","This book has its share of cute and humorous moments, but in my opinion it was at least 75 pages too long. Since the plot isn't exactly hard to figure out and the writing isn't exactly Pulitzer-worthy, I found myself skimming through the last 1/3 of the book. At that point I was over the humor and banter between the characters and I just wanted it to end already."
3,Interesting but not compelling,"I thought this book was really cute. I love how it was written in email format because you could hear the story from everyone's point of view. It was fun to read, however it was extremely predictable. I mean, there must be dozens of books (and movies) with slightly different variations of this plot...the whole person pretends to be someone else and falls in love thing. Meggin Cabot threw in some new aspects, like the mystery and such to keep it fun to read. I'd reccommend getting this book from the library, it's not the type of book you would want to read numerous times."
5,Totally Irresistable,"""The Boy Next Door"" is full of wit, creativity, and charm. The main characters were totally irresistable. I couldn't put the book down, and therefore finished it in two days (Yes, I have a life and a full time job.) If you enjoy witty humor, some romance, and tons of sarchasm; this is a must have book."
3,Entertaining fantasy but predictable ending,"Mel has fallen in love with a boy whom she thinks is the philandering nephew of her elderly neighbor. Said boy is really the super-rich college roommate of the philandering nephew who couldn't be bothered to come back to New York to take care of his aunt after she was attacked in her apartment. The nephew convinced the friend to pose as him so that the aunt wouldn't write him out of the will for frolicking with a supermodel while she was in a coma. By about page 50, you can completely predict the ending. You might even be able to predict the ending from my little plot summary. The book is enjoyable enough to read though. The email format reminds me of similar conversations with friends. Even though the extra characters (the boss, the gay co-worker, the slutty co-worker) are stereotypes, they add humor and interest to the plot. If you want something light and fun to read but don't want to be seen with a romance novel, read this."
5,Written entirely by email!!!,Meggin Cabot shows her creativity when she writes this novel using only emails between characters. It's hilarious and extremely tounge-in-cheek at times. I enjoyed this style of writing and I'll certainly be checking out this author's other works!
2,mindless no brainer--cute at first--then annoying,"I really enjoyed reading this when I first began because it was written in ""email"" format between all the main and supporting characters. It began as a fast, couldn't-put-it-down read and then it just got to the point where the supporting characters were just annoying, nosy and didn't give me a reason to care for the storyline. While it was unique to formulate the story in email form, the length and details of the email conversations (most of the time took place at the characters' place of employment) were at times ridiculously long and too detailed-no one usually has that much time to write emails like that unless they really want to jeopardize their job standing! The motives for the actions between the two main characters at times made no sense---it was very drawn out. But if you like no brianer, romance novels then try it out. COnsider borrowing it from a friend and don't waste your money!"
1,Very disappointing,"I was very disappointed with Muppet Babies - Toyland Train. First there is a very long introduction that no toddler is going to have the patience to sit through. Then the activities are rather boring, they are not so imaginative or playful. I was also shocked when I tried using it and Kermit the Frog told me I had answered wrong, please try again! What a blow to a toddler's self-esteem! So don't waste your money on this program, get Reader Rabbit Toddler instead, it's much better."
3,Windows 2000 problem,"Good and educational for childs. I have this software, but bought a new PC with windows 2000. Now my child is not able to use it anymore, because there is no sound.Make it compatible !!!!!!!"
2,i agree,"i agree with the other review. who in the world picked these songs? how is ""we came to rock"" not on here? there WAS a video for it. i only know their first album. the first 5 songs on it should be on here. when you are trying to sell a hits album from a band that was never huge (especially in america), pack it was all of their good songs. when i saw this cd, i was hoping to get it to have any of their other good songs from their other 2 albums. but apparently this is not the case. not sure how ""barricade"" was chosen over others off their first album. very disappointing."
5,"Canton's ""Kingdom Business"" CD - WOW!!!","This CD is on fire...I can't get enough of it...it's been in my CD player for 2/3 weeks and I'm not tired yet. Every song is HOT...full of the Word...every rap is thorough, better than any secular hip hop rap artist out there. This project is all that...the title says it all...it's without a doubt ""Kingdom Business"" I encourage everyone to check this out and be sure to get it for your children, especially your teenagers...I guarantee they'll love it. Canton, I thank God for you and your gift. Stay encouraged my brother and continue to represent Christ. I love you with the love of the Lord! Blessed!!!"
4,Good album to add to the collection.,"This is a good album to have. I'm listened to it over and over again. I gave it four stars only because there's one song on the album '24's' which in my opinion can rub people the wrong way. If Jesus wasn't thrown in that song a couple of times, it would really just be on any rap album in the world. Just that song is very unoriginal. Being a worship leader at my church, it' important to really get all forms of Christ worship to reach the masses. I would also strongly recommended Da' T.R.U.T.H."
4,Take the good with the bad,"Overall I enjoyed this project. The flavor is def there but it does lack consistency. Sometimes I forgot I was listening to Christian music. The one song I could do without was 24's. No matter how much we love God, how long we've been saved we should never glorify material things such as the size of our rims or what kind of whips we drive. I could hear this all day in secular music which I choose not to listen to anymore b/c of this very fact. Cajo is gifted and I know my unsaved friends would be feeling this, but I wouldn't want to portray my new found faith as a ""have it all; money and Jesus"" But you have to take the good with the bad and overall I enjoyed this album."
5,Best Gospel CD Of The Year!!!,"This was one of the best (if not THE best) cd I've gotten this year! The lyrics, production, and singing are outstanding. Canton could easily be a superstar if he went mainstream which makes me admire him even more for doing the gospel music thing. My top 3 songs are ""Hater Day,"" ""Kingdom Business,"" and ""My Day"" but all of the songs are definitely worth a listen. If you're in to good hip hop and r&b you definitely won't regret getting this one! Positive message + positively good talent & faith = a hit cd."
5,Canton Jones handing his business,If you love hip hop and want something positive to listen to with the whole family and get your worship on.... then Kingdom Business is the cd to have.
5,A great flag,"I bought this flag for a prop in a cosplay. All of the characters carry flags of the countries their from. The flag stayed in great condition being high winds near the water to inside. I would buy from this company again. In fact, I did. For the nest time I am playing this character I wanted a larger flag, so 3 X 5 I choose."
2,POOR PRODUCTION,"WOW, I LOVE MY OTHER BRYAN LEE CD'S WITH GREAT BACKING MUSICIANS AND WONDERFUL PRODUCTION VALUES. THIS CD IS MUDDY SOUNDING AND BRYAN SEEMS RELUCTANT TO PLAY HIS GUITAR. IF YOU'RE A FAN, SKIP THIS CD. IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING A BRYAN LEE CD (AND YOU SHOULD) BUY ANY OTHER."
5,Poet has many veteran fathers...,"Linh is a young poet who has tasted many things during his young life. He is one of America's adopted sons who is grateful for being an American. He is sincere in his approach as a young child leaving his country of Vietnam to come to America.Linh's gratitude is remarkablly innocent in that he believes all who fought to bring freedom to his Homeland are heroes and they are his fathers. I have been called his ""papasan"".It is a shame that those born here don't have the same sense of love and gratitude for being born here. His poems are rich in praise of the soldiers, fathers,sons, husbands, children of those who fought but were forgotten. It is as if he were a one man machine who refuses to let anyone be forgotten."
2,A gentle rain,"This showerhead would be fine if all you desired was a relaxing shower to take away the stress of the day.If you wash your hair with shampoo or use soap to cleanse yourself, you may want to think again. In a house with rather strong water pressure I was frustrated by the showerhead's complete inability to rinse shampoo out of my hair in a reasonable amount of time. Note that I did, in fact, remove the restrictor washers that limit the output of water...Find another showerhead."
1,No Good - broke,"I had my plumber try to install this in the course of putting in a new bathroom. As he tightened it on, it broke right off."
1,one of the worst movies made,Hey wanna see a good movie. rent star wars THE FIRST ONE. Not that episode 1 trash. this is pure trash.
1,The Jury Has Reached A Verdict:BUST!!,"This movie is incredibly gut-wrenhing.I hate all movies where the whole story revolves around men dressing up as women,so it's kind of obvious why I hate this movie.Do you wanna know why this movie is bad?The movie is about someone who dresses up as a woman to play basketball.Nuff' said.Peace Out."
3,Reasonably funny comedy if you don't expect too much,"This is good for some laughs and has a heart-warming story in a rather low-key way. But it will disappoint some. Pared-down to a PG-13 rating for whatever purpose, it seems a movie more suited for R-status. Those hoping for nude scenes in obviousplaces will be disappointed, for example. And gender bending issues are treated neither with aiming for depth or with the zaniest humorous effects, though they work somewhat more in the latter sense. Still for undemanding viewers it isn't the worst way to spend an hour and a half."
4,Better than anticipated.,This film was one that I at first hesitated to see but was quite impressed when I did. I think Miguel Nunez Jr.(not Orlando Jones) was very funny in this comedy film. Vivica Fox was as lovely as always. In order to see this kind of movie one must come with an open mind and understand it's something not to be taken too seriously. I have to say I'm happy to see Miguel Nunez getting more work and recognition than usual. He's truly a very talented actor and hopefully we'll see more of him. I have to say that I'm a little disappointed that so far there's no soundtrack for the film. It has great music in it.
3,A semi-funny comedy but overall a good movie,Juwanna Mann isn't a horrible movie just a by the numbers comedy. The film has the same jokes that most gender benders comedy's do which get tired after a while. Miguel A .Nunez does good carrying the movie by himself but Tommy Davidson and Kim Wayans steal every scene their in. Ginuwine does a great acting job in his first movie and Mrs.Fox is good as always. While the jokes in the gilm are the same overall the film is good and has a nice message. If Warener had a soundtrack to back the film then it would have been better and Warner could have had a sleeper hit on their hands.
4,Grate!,"I really like this movie. Juwanna Mann was really funny and I will watich it over one or two, maybe a thard time. Grate movie."
2,Classic Rasheed Wallace Cameo,"Marginal movie at best. I knew it was going to be dumb, but I watched it anyway. I don't know how anyone can really be upset about this movie, if you read the back of the box you know exactly what to expect. Gender/Racial stereotypes are the driving force behind the humor and, as usual, these don't add a whole lot of value to the movie. I thought the Rasheed Wallace cameo was surprising and funny, but the movie overall is fairly predictable. Rent it if you want to switch your brain off for approximately 91 minutes, but don't expect it to win any retroactive awards."
3,funny but completely ridiculous,like everyone said - it's ok if you expect it to be terrible i.e. satisfaction = experience - expectationsbut the plot is so totally unrealistic that it works against the movie - and not for it - if it could have been a little more believeable it probably would have been funnier - but it was funny..
4,Fun Movie,"JUWANNA MANN! I can enjoy this movie any day, it's a really funny and laidback movie. It has the feel of Big mommas house but not fat lol. I think everybody can enjoy this, it's not just a black comedy."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"This book suscribes to the usual retirement formula of needingpiles of money to retire. It pretty much adheres to the ideathat one needs to replace 70-80% of pre-retirement income in orderto retire. The best books on this subject focus instead on usingthe approach of how much income do you need to retire with what youneed? In other words, what will you need to maintain a decentstandard of living?"
1,Pirated DVD of low quality music videos.,"I bought this DVD as a gift. When I opened the shipping box I looked at the DVD. The DVD was not a fully licensed DVD for the pussy cat dolls. This was a low quality collection of female groups and artists music videos. There is Britney Spears, Christina aguilera, Jessica simpson, ashley simpson music videos featured in this pirated dvd. I am very disappointed because this was suppose to be a Xmas gift, but unfortunately I had to find another gift due to this mislead purchase / false advertising / wrongful portrayal of this being the Pussy Cat Dolls music videos DVD."
3,Good book,Good book but I would have loved it if the story and characters had been explored in more detail and depth.Otherwise I really enjoyed this book.
3,Photo isn't correct,Item doesn't look the same as the picture it's OK but not what I ordered.I will keep it but want to warn others
4,Book 2,"I enjoyed the book. But I would have loved it, if the end had been a little more dramatic. Even so it was still a good read."
4,Glee and Mr. Blankenship,"As Book 2 in the Brides of Bath Series, this story includes most of the characters from the first novel (The Bride Wore Blue) and adds a few new ones as well.Glee has loved Mr. Blankenship...aka Blanks....for as long as she can remember. The dashingly handsome best friend of her older brother, though, still thinks of her as barely out of the school room. When terms of his newly deceased father's will dictate that he must be wed before his 25th birthday (a mere few months away) to inherit, Glee proposes an ""arrangement"" to Blanks.Knowing he has no desire to wed or give up his lifestyle of debauchery, Glee tells him that she will be his wife in name only, and not expect him to reform in the least. In fact, he doesn't even have to give up his mistress!Glee is convinced that if just given the chance, she can win Blanks over and become his wife in every way. It is a most enjoyable read following them through the journey."
3,Misses the Target,"Editing was lacking. Spelling errors made this book frustrating to read. Occasionally the wrong character is listed. Storyline is weak. I found myself skimming several pages at a time. Ms Bolen seems to get close, but often just misses the target."
3,Nothing special,"This was an okay story. I enjoyed the read, but it was a little ridiculous the way the main character acted. I don't regret reading it and it filled the time I needed filled, but I doubt I'll continue with the series."
3,A flat and dull story,"So why did I buy the book after having read the sample? Well, the story starts out well enough and generally I like Ms Bolen's books and to tell the truth it's a well written story. My only complaint is that after the first few pages nothing much happens. It's not funny, nor heartbreaking or anything else, just plain dull and then it is full of spelling mistakes etc. You do not always know who is speaking and to whom."
1,too long,"it was too long and boring. the hero was nice. the heroine did whatever she wanted and when her plans did not work she gave up. she knows what people are like, but she trusted them."
4,nanakindlebooks,"This is the second in the series and a fun continuation of the characters first introduced in ""The Bride Wore Blue"". I is also a very different and unique love story."
5,Beautiful ... Am now a Cheryl Bolen fan!,"I'm always a fan of ""childhood friends fall in love"" romances, and this one is so lovely. The main characters are attractive; the secondary characters very appealing. There's humor, authentic emotion, and a nice bit of passion to keep things interesting."
3,Too busy,"It was not clear from any of the pictures I saw of this flag on several sites, but the yellow field has a repeating pattern of the Notre Dame leprechaun. It makes the flag too busy. Unfortunately, there are not many choices for Notre Dame flags. Also, the material is pretty heavy. This is good and bad. Good because it should hold up well. Bad because you need a pretty strong breeze for the flag to fly. This is a 2-sided flag so there are two layers of pretty heavy material. I have this on the yardarm of a nautical flagpole so it hangs open a little, enough so my neighbors who went to Ohio State and Purdue notice it."
5,Excellent company.,"Excellent company to do business with, good prices, prompt shipment and return policy. Quite satisfied with this company. Lloyd Pearson"
3,"Nice watch, but...","I like the watch, because it has both gold and silver to wear with any other jewelry, it's light and good-looking, and the band is open-able on any link. However, the date window is so small that I can't make out the number in it, which kind of sucks, because that was one of the features I was looking for. Why didn't I return it?....good question. Maybe because I got a ""free"" tote bag with it. 1/2013: After having this watch for awhile, I realize the date feature isn't so important...I usually know the date, anyway. And I do like the watch, even though I sometimes have to fumble around with it for a minute or two to get it off, because the link occasionally gets caught on its other ""half"" and won't let go."
5,perfect product/ fast shipping/ great communications,Thank you so much. Item is in perfect condition and is the right one for the job.
1,No UL approval,"The product does not bear any UL, EU, or TÜV markings. It works, but I will be getting something else."
2,Cheap,This adapter is cheaply made and I do not expect it to last very long. I ordered in too big a hurry and didn't notice that this was not a NES product. My bad!
4,Works well.,"Does everything I want it to with my SNES. The only negative is the quality of construction. It is strangely light and feels flimsy. Oh, well. I'm playing games."
1,Not really a good product for NES,"I had high hopes for this item. But like with most things in life, you get what you pay for.First off, this AC adapter is not only specifically for NES, it has the SNES plug on it too, that's cool and all...maybe useful for some. The problem is the adapter is rated at 10v, which might have been okay if that's what the actual output was. My multimeter says its outputting just over 15v though! The NES does not like this, it constantly emits a humming noise through the TV speaker. I ended up buying a 9v 1000ma adapter from the second hand store and it works perfectly.I do not recommend buying this product for the NES."
2,Faulty construction,"When my adapter arrived it was actually open - the two pieces don't fit together entirely and there's a corner of it that's always slightly ajar, letting air (or anything else) inside the unit. If I had any faith about the construction of this piece I'd get a replacement, but the whole thing seems so cheaply made that I'd rather just find a different product and throw this one in the garbage. On the plus side...it did actually work for the short time I used it."
5,great,a great addition needed to play NES or any older system that you might want to revisit for nostalgias sake
4,The Inside,"Wow, this is a great album. For those of you unfamiliar with Jasmine Cain this is the best first album to sample her music. There are so many great songs to experience. There are rock songs as well as ballads. Listen to a few of the song samples and make up your own mind. I was able to see Jasmine in concert in Deadwood a few years back and have been hooked ever since. ""The Inside"" title track is a great track but really just an intro to the entire album. I personally love ""Help Me"" and ""Sweet Euphoria."" If you are a fan of great rock music you won't be disappointed."
5,"Hard keys to play, but I love the music.","I am musical theater singer who loves to buy sheet music and sing through all the songs I love. This past year I have purchased Avenue Q, Wicked,The boy from Oz, and Assasins on sheet music. Unfortunately I am an intermediate pianist, so I often find myself player the right hand melody line and adding in as much of the left as I can. All these new musicals have such difficult keys, and they change constantly throughout the songs.I can also recommend ""Voice Lessons To Go"" by Vaccarino. They are voice lessons on CD. They have saved me a ton of money in voice lessons. I may need the money for some more piano lessons to play these scores!"
5,Such great music,Used this for a few auditions (and hope to be in a production next year!)Great music; very funny! You won't be disappointed.
4,Don't Believe Every Review You Read,"After reading the reviews availible here and other places online I was concerned when I ordered my score of Avenue Q. To read some of the comments of other customers one might thinks this musical score to actually be quite challenging to play.This is a very nice arrangement for a simply wonder musical!! There are a FEW places where the timing might take a second to figure out but words like challenging, difficult, and hard certainly do not discribe any piece of this arrangment.I was able to sit down and play through the musical this afternoon when it arrived with out any trouble. A Mixed Tape has to be the most challenging and even that once you see exactly what is going on is easily understood. That said, I am a studio musician here in Los Angeles so easy to me might not be easy to every one, however this score is VERY PLAYABLE.I encourage anyone who has enjoyed the musical Avenue Q to also purchase the score for their piano."
1,Not as good as the description,"I have dry hair type and wanted to buy something to make it healthier. However, after using the product, my hair gets worse. I have purchased another Paul Mitchell conditioner which is much better than this and would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Leaves residue,"I tried this when I ran out of the product I usually used. I picked this one because Paul Mitchell is usually a good product and it said it was lite and didn't weigh your hair down. I'm dragging my brush through my hair when I I'm drying it and it takes forever to dry my hair. This is unusual because my hair is thin and usually dries very quickly. My hair doesn't look natural when it is dry because it feels like I never rinsed the conditioner out. It's heavy and if I run my fingers through my hair there is a terrible waxy residue left. I still use their Shampoo One on occasion which is a great product, but I would have to say I really was dissatisfied with the conditioner."
3,dont buy this game,dont waste your money on this game i bought it and it was just ridiculous. if you want a good game buy rocky legends. i only give it 3 stars cuz they did a good job on the characters
3,tedius,"Cute graphics, some historical inaccuracies (e.g. saxons dressed like romans wielding celtic shields and fighting like roman legions). Game play is simply too hard for 1 player as you reach higher levels, feels more like gang rape then video game (you're the one on the wrong end),Want to experience saxon gang-rape? Play this game."
1,Sensitive Skin WATCH OUT!,I was introduced to this products when I went to get a facial. The gel gave me a horrible allergy of swelling on the face and neck and eyelids even though she said she put water on the cotton balls that she put on my eyelids. I thought that I am allergic to gels. Then I used the Credentials bisabolol nutrient mask three weeks later. I got itchy skin on my face and hours later another allergic reaction. This is my third time having this allergic episodes after using Credentials. The only one that have worked fine is the cleansing milk for sensitive sking. The other sensitive skin products gave me allergy. I found a bad review about the gel.Credentials New Skin Retexturizing Gel 2.5 fl oz.
4,What's with all the complaining?,"I gave this 4 stars because you definetly get to see the real Kelly, and learn some new things about her you probably didn't know. I did not give it 5 stars because it would have been nice to have more special features. However, I don't see why everyone is claiming the DVD is decieving...they CLEARLY show it is a documentary of her life. What did you think it was going to be when they said ""Go behind the scenes at her Highschool etc.""?"
2,Was not new,"I bought a new DVD, and the DVD was used. The cover was broken and the box open. Yhe dvd is perfect for fans of Kelly Clarkson, very funny this documentary!!! But dont buy here, because I how I said, I pay for a new, and was not!"
1,Deceptive. No music videos = boring.,"I bought this because I thought it had 5 of her music videos included. That being said, it doesn't contain 1 of her music videos, and I was extremely upset. A 60 minute documentary is basically the only thing on this dvd, and that is for die hard Kelly fans, not for people like me who just dig her music videos."
3,"O.K., Could be better","I bought this dvd for my sister for her birthday, i was hoping it would have videos or something. turns out i didn't but it had the songs as background music. However if you're a fan you should buy this, because it shows stuff that you wouldn't see on T.V., not to mention she's a hottie, so that's cool. The special features kinda suck though. I liked this dvd because she's hot, but if you're a real fan you'll like it because it's her"
1,boring,The back cover represents content includes several songs which are not on this dvd. This is only a documentary with no music.
3,enjoyable but wheres the music?,"we bought this dvd for our daughter and even tho it was cute we were dissapointed that they did not put any music videos or live performances on it.we read the back and expected more, our daughter will probably like it but she will want the music also"
1,Boston,The advertising on the box is as deceptive as it gets. Leads you to believe that the DVD has 5 music videos which it doesn't. This reminds me of a home video on Kelly Clarkson. I would have no problem with the DVD if it told you that it was a compilation of the Kelly Clarkson life story and eliminated the reference to the five songs on the back of the box. You would then get what you bargained for - BUT to list the songs as though they are contained on the DVD is the worst
1,This was a RIPOFF,"I love Kelly, that is why I bought the video a month in advance.... I thought there would be videos in addition to her biography... This is a Bio ONLY!!!!!! No Videos!!!!!!! Poor representation of what you get. And why??? Kelly why no videos?????? To me a waste of money totally..."
3,Missing an important element,"this is missing the greatest new christmas songi've ever heard....the song is ""just in time forchristmas"" by balladeer Mark Milovats....What a pity the producers didn't include thisperfect song for this album. how could they have missed this one ....so aptly titled."
2,Shower Fanatic,"The book has beautiful pictures & ideas however it is not reaslistic for the average person. There are no recipes or menu ideas. The instructions for favors and decorations are minimal. Not worth the money. Everything I got from this book, I could easily get off the web."
1,avoid grover,"I have been working in the design field for over 10 years now and I have yet to see a worse ripp off then this author not only are there no directions to her projects, but who would want to engage them selves in anything that turned out so chic and cheesey. I have personally met the author and her family I knew them for quite a while infact and never did I find that she could creatively enhance a project. she has some small skill in putting together junk so it doesn't look so much like junk. butlets face it - it's still junk. not something I would put in my house nor in my clients homes."
3,greatness and uninventiveness,"some of his stories are truly great. the monkey's paw and toll-house. some pretty good. his brother's keeper and jerry Bundler. but when he doesn't have much of a plot, the result is sad. uninventive. and awfully obvious. at his best his plot is excellent, his descriptions good, the suspence of the characters marked well."
5,Ibn Ishaq biography is great,One of the best biographies of the most influential man ever to live. Muhammad (Peace be Upon Him) is a Prophet of God and people need to read about his life to know. After learning about him from authentic sources one knows that indeed he was a prophet of God.
2,Most Unfortunate,"It seems i must agree a hundred percent , if not more, with our good friend mrashdan_mradzi who has written his long review on this book. The simple fact that at least one of the incidents in the book is false clearly shows that this book is a danger to a new believer or anyone even curious about the Islamic Religion.If mrashdan_mradzi happens to come across this review, please contact me ... and let me know if you have come across a better book."
1,Beware of Guillaume's Distortion of the Sira by Ibn Ishaq,"Guillaume resorts to dishonesties too numerous to mention; among them is the insertion of two pages from one of at-Tabari's works, in which at-Tabari recounts a spurious tale (Page 165). Guillaume never indicates his external quotations clearly, flanking them with parenthesis instead of setting them apart from the main body text, and preceeding them with a ""T"" which is vigorously employed but never explained. A lay muslim can fall in the trap and swallow truth with polytheistic fiction and unwittingly accept the tale as a definitive part of Ibn Ishaq's serious historical work.The sad part is that this book has been published continously in muslim countries since 1967"
5,My review,The book is very detailed and i believe it to be a must read for those interested in the Life Of the Prophet(SAW)
3,Informative,"Very informative. Given that the Koran is not in chronological order, this book helps put the Koran's chapters in a historical context.The print was a bit fine. However, I suppose that if the font size were larger, that would mean more pages - and it is a relatively thick book."
2,A classical work but not history,This is a book mostly for the layman who is not fussed about getting the facts right but who just wants to enjoy a good story. The work is centuries old and so it is better to read a more critical work on Muhammad (if such a book exists at the moment) before reading this book. This is because it is written by a devout Muslim and it would be fair to presume that it is concerned mostly with religious issues then the historical truth (like trying to learn about the Historical Jesus from the Gospels).
2,Most Unfortunate,"It seems i must agree a hundred percent , if not more, with our good friend mrashdan_mradzi who has written his long review on this book. The simple fact that at least one of the incidents in the book is false clearly shows that this book is a danger to a new believer or anyone even curious about the Islamic Religion."
5,the Voyage of the star wolf,"I love all of davids books they all are well written and alot of work put in the back ground,they grab you and take you along for the ride."
2,"Can you say ""editor""?",Hard to read because it was presumably not proof read at all. Story is good but hard to enjoy. Send it to me or any grammer school student for free editing but don't publish like this one was.
3,Needs serious editing!,"This book needs serious revision! It contains hundreds of missing words, punctuation errors and capitalization mistakes, sometimes four or five per page. It looks like it passed a basic spell checker, but that was all. The story and writing style were very good, but the many errors and omissions detracted from the finished product. If you can overlook the editing inaccuracies, go ahead and read it, if you can't, forget it!"
4,SciFi Good un.,"This book was a conglomeration of two worlds. The Navy Seal who suddenly finds himself in a spaceship with two aliens, and two aliens who find themselves with a human who is able to do amazing feats of strength. The plot is a good one and the ending leaves you wanting more. It has all the good stuff of SciFi like ray guns and space pirates, and I enjoyed it immensely."
3,Fun but no meat,This was a fun read but I kept waiting for more characer development and more science. Perhaps follow-on books will be better and fill in the gaps bt I don't think I will be reading them.
1,TERRIBLE editing!,"I certainly hope that the hard copy version of this book is not this way. I recently bought the Kindle version though, and it is seriously almost painful to read. Whole words are missing, words and phrases are truncated, descriptive verbs are simply not there... you have to GUESS at what the author meant in that phrase in that particular position in the storyline. Seriously, it's almost as if the Kindle version editing was performed by someone who had almost zero understanding of the English language.About the story - if the editing was better I would give it 4 stars."
1,"Terrific book, horrible ebook","Missing words every other sentence. It's an exercise in English syntax just to guess what the story should be at times.This is a terrific book, and a shameful example of an e-book."
3,A decent pulp sci-fi read,"A friend suggested this book, and it turned out to be entertaining. It feels like pulp military sci-fi, and since Gerrold's background is Star Trek TOS (The Trouble With Tribbles) & TNG - you can immediately see references and character traits similar to Star Trek. The storyline was quick paced, and kept me engaged. There are no strong, developed female characters though - so it is definitely geared for guys.After reading this 1st novel of the Star Wolf trilogy, I'm eager to continue reading the series."
5,The Voyage of the Star Wolf,"I first read this book about ten (10) years ago. In the past,after I have read a book, it becomes my friend and I put it in my personal Library to read again. However, somewhere in the last few years I have lost some of my books while moving. Once I found this book again through Kindle I immediately bought it to read. I have enjoyed it more this time than the last. I have also been able to obtain the whole series and I am in the process of reading the rest of it. So if you enjoy a good story with a believeable plot and interesting characters, this is the one for you. Mr. Gerrold is a teller of stories. And there is nothing like a good Story."
2,Missing (words) in action,"There are a lot of missing words in the eBook. Mostly little words, like me, I, us, the, etc. Makes it pretty difficult to follow. I don't know what happened, but something isn't right. The low rating is based mainly on the bad editing."
3,SLOW!!!!!,I read this book years ago and while the setting is interesting and the idea of the plot and premise is cool the actual book itself is painfully slow! Most things happen at a snail pace and while the characters are interesting and kept me reading till the end the overall book could have really used a faster pace with more action and a lot less mental introspection.
1,The Editing Killed the Book,"I managed about a third of the book before the poor editing made me delete it. The story was very good but I couldn't get past the editing. If you feel that you want to read this book, I recommend you purchase the paper edition."
1,Rippoff,I feel sorry for any author whose publisher would release such shoddy crap as this ebook. It's unreadable and not even worth the ninety-nine cent cost.
2,Kindle version incomplete / poorly made (Voyage of the Star Wolf),"To quote a previous commenter, ""It's still a great story (four stars), but the Kindle Edition sucks (one star). Many, many, many sentences are incomplete or missing words.""I'm enjoying the story. But as the previous commenter noted.. many, MANY sentences are truncated, leaving the reader to infer what the author wrote. An example, ""We did an exemplary job, we brought back intelligence that no one else has ever accomplished. It's wrong to punish You not only deny us, but you deny the fleet the benefit of a crew has proven itself under fire.""Some chapters are in pristine condition, but many of them are full of incomplete text. It's a shame."
1,Buyer Beware/exploding glass!,"I purchased three of these for my teenagers. They are not dishwasher safe, but also become submerged inside with water when hand washed. While attempting to remove the bottom lid to drain it, the vacuumed glass exploded in my face sending shears of glass across the room. This product is unsafe!"
1,ITEM NOT SAFE,I WAS LOOKING FOR A GLASS THERMOS...BUT THIS IS GLASS COVERED IN PLASTIC THERMOS!!! NOT WHAT I NEEDED. WHEN I RECEIVED AND OPENED IT THE THERMOS EXPLODED IN MY HANDS.
1,Not For Genesis,"This is NOT a Sega Genesis II plug. It is for Game Gear, and will not work on the Sega Genesis.Attempts to get the proper plug from Beach Audio were ignored. They asked me to return the product, but never sent the label for me to do so.Just be warned if you're getting thing for anything but a Game Gear."
2,For Game Gear *AT YOUR OWN RISK*,"I hate two things about this adapter, firstly- it doesn't fit. It definitely looks like it should, but it's just a liiiiiittle too big. I left it on my desk for about five days (intending on returning it), but first I looked at some other information online... Frustration must have gotten the best of me, and I decided to physically jam it in there... (nothing broke, it actually fits, probably not how it should, but it does fit). Secondly, the volt output of the adapter is DC 10V ... the Game Gear only needs DC 9V. I don't know if it's too much volts where it will cause damage, but I turned it on for a second and it does work... However, after potentially breaking my Game Gear twice, I think I'll just go back to using batteries. ~thanks"
2,Doesn't Quite Fit,"It is the right voltage and amperage to work for a Generation 2 Sega Genesis, but the damn thing doesn't quite fit in it. You can make it work by jamming it in there, but you feel like it's going to break. It's just a little to big"
5,Works great.,This Sega Genesis cable works great. Now all we need is one of those cable TV things so that we can get channel 3!
4,power cord,it was all i hoped 4. it made my system work. i enjoy sega genesis so i got my power cord
1,will not work,"bought it for game gear, plugged it in, tried turning it on, turns on for a second, then shuts off, with all my games.game gear works with batteries, but not this."
3,It was ok,This was my first time reading from this author. It was ok. I was a little disappointed. I don't think I will go to the next book. Maybe I will try another series from this author. The writing was good; I just don't think I liked the story line.
2,Not at all what I expected,"Sadly it was boring. I realized later that this is the third book in a series. Maybe there is something I missed but everything seemed to be explained; however, while listening I simply assumed a few things. Boy was I disappointed. This book was separated into two audio files. The two characters don't meet until a little ways into the second part leading me to believe you are nearly three-fifths of the way through the book when John Falconer actually appears. Something else that bothered me was the endings... mystery. To me the book didn't end... and from what I've read of books that follow... the story is altogether disappointing. I can't decide if I want to know what happens or if I should give up on it all together!"
3,A Respectable Introduction,"John of Damascus is one of the most valuable of fathers given that his works, especially ""The Orthodox Faith,"" serve as a compilation of what the Eastern Fathers believed, as if John were summarizing Eastern thought for the ages in his works.As far as it goes this is a fine introduction to the Damascene, but Louth does not tell you much that you could not glean from reading John of Damascus's own writings yourself. The material is presented in a scholarly fashion but I was disappointed by the lack of real theological insight into the Damascene's thought.Only recommended for Beginners."
2,Contrived and biased,"Attempting to answer the heated DC v Marvel debate, the artwork is the only reason this book gets 2 stars in this review. I'm sorry, but the writers gave way too much favour to the Marvel stars, where obvious DC heavyweights lost to their Marvel ""counterparts"". (((SPOILER))) How is Storm able to withstand a kick to the head from Wonder Woman????? And even if Spidey is a worldwide favourite...come on Superboy could break Spiderman in half!(((SPOILER)))Other than the obvious Marvel bias, the story premise is very thin as if no effort was taken in dreaming up the reason why the superheroes would be fighting each other.If you skip this book, you aren't missing much..."
3,An ok read. I don't agree with some out comes.,First off. The art is great. True eye candy. But the story line was confussing and dull. The fights were way way to short for there own good and the book tried way to hard to constantly bring back a dieing or dead plot. I think they should of cut out the whole DC and Marvel cross over part to make room for what people picked this up for in the first place. THE FIGHTS! I don't really want to see the new hero try to bring balence to the two worlds. I wana see LoBo and Wolvy fight to blood and gutts glory!!! and I want it to last longer than. I hit you. You hit me. I fall. you win. Pick it up and take a read. Put don't get your hopes up. Your not gonna see The Hulk and Superman leavling mountains or bat-man and Cap. Fighting all out over the streets of gothem. It could of been alot better.
3,Mindless fun but ultimately not deep enough,"Alright. This book is very shaky in terms of why these universes are coming together. I just thought that instead of developing this huge overdone story behind why the two universes cross over, we should have seen just the fights and made them longer than they are. Hulk vs. Superman was four pages, I kid you not!!! I also think that the fights should have been better thought out. Namor vs Aquaman? Namor would totally win, but this book decided to not face the facts. I also didn't understand that this was part of that whole Amalgam stint that was going on, where the characters meld into one another and form new ones. Overall, if you like mindless action and a subpar plot, go for it. Oh yeah, the art is done by someone new on almost every page, so don't get your hopes up, it kind of stinks all together."
3,INTERESTING YET CONFUSING,"This selection is interesting yet confusing. The story line, itself, really doesn't make much sence, but it does make for some interesting match ups.It was cool to see some of your favorites face off against each other, though the results were questionable.Superman vs Hulk - Silver Surfer vs Green Lantern - Capt. Marvel vs Thor - Just to name a few.The story line may be bad but this is still cool."
1,Greatly Dissappointed,"Hello EveryoneI've just finished reading DC Vs Marvel I and I have to be honest, It totally sucked and made zero sense. The entire story was idiotic and boring to the tee. I mean the fights between the two different superhero factions were boring especially Wonder Women Vs Storm. I have already forgotten if Thor fought anyone in this issue. When I was a kid certain comics were so great that I must have spent countless of hours re-reading each issue, this comic I already tossed it in the closet. What were they thinking? Even the Characters looked different, Batman and Captain America looked off... What a shame, I hope they pay closer attention if they ever decide to make a Superhero movie involving both comics."
3,Too Short,"The idea is great and the artwork cool, but overall I have to agree that this is much too small a format for such a sprawling concept. In order to cram everything in, what should be epic confrontations are mashed the smallest possible space.That said, I must take issue with this absurd idea that no one likes Captain America. That's just silly; Cap has always been and remains a fan favorite. I find it funny to see him refrred to as dated when Batman is as clunky and old-timey as they come!"
3,Weak battles,"This series suffers from a couple of things. First, way too much build up to battles which end up lasting only a page or so. The second is that for the most part, it's a second string line-up. None of the match-ups really generated much excitement for me either. Storm vs. Wonderwoman? Yawn! A series that had potential, but turns out mediocre!"
1,Disapointing read,Disappointing overall. The almagam universe was the most interesting idea and was touched on too brief like everything else in this book. The amalgam series alone is far better than this effort and I would not waste time purchasing this book. Try the amalgam trades and also try JLA / Avengers - that book is far better and keeps all characters in 'character'.
3,DC versus Marvel versus Grasping at straws,"The concept is fantastic. Let's have Marvel's best duke it out against DC's best. The artwork is outstanding as well. However, my biggest complaint is the same as many other readers; the battles are far too short. Plus, some of them end in some sense of confusion. It leaves the reader scratching their head thinking, ""So how did he beat him?"" or ""You're kidding me. He won by doing that??"" The Aquaman/Sub-Mariner battle is a perfect example of the latter. The storyline on how this happens gets a little out of control. I don't feel as if there was much thought put into how these two universes were brought together."
3,good art,"GOOD ART. OK PLOT but there is no reason why they fight in the begining. The fights are not long enough to satisfy you. Dumb ending. There are some cool things that happen. Wonder Women gaining the power of Thor. If you want action and good art then get it. If your looking for a really good story, forget it."
5,A Must Have,"I can't say I'm overly well versed in composition, namely because most books on the subject are so dense. But in Picture This, the author has found easily understandable way to show the basic fundamentals of art.Rather than teach composition with diagrams drawn over old master paintings like some books, Molly Bang uses simple bits of paper to demonstrate how shape, color and placement can affect the mood of a picture. And once you understand these principles, it's easy to see how they can be applied to more complex artwork.Bang's pace is very deliberate. Every change to her construction paper compositions is well documented and explained. It's that simplicity and directness that allow her to communicate such a large amount of knowledge in only 96 pages.And don't let the short page count and the fact that this book is recommended for grade schoolers fool you. This is a book every artist should have her shelf."
2,Unusal method of teaching composition.,"This book would be ideal for a first-time camera user. It is amazingly simplistic. If you're looking for actual tips and techniques, pass this one by."
5,Good intro to design.,A lot of beginning art students don't understand the importance of design as they're too interested in rendering and lose sight of the whole. The design and the underlying subliminal abstract geometry is quite possibly the most important aspect of good picture making. This book does a great job explaining some of the most essential concepts in a very understandable format.
4,great,"had to buy this book for a class I'm taking on children's literature. But this book is so fascinating, it's one I'll be keeping and not selling back."
3,Live & Let Die ( cd maxi - single ),"You Have the ( LP Version ) Of the song. And You have the live version of the song. And You have a extra track thats a non lp song, ( Shadow of you'r love )wich is (live studio recording ) its ok, not my faviort cd maxi sing just, ok"
4,This pen is a very unique one.,"This pen is very nice. In my job i use it every day. It works good, writes good, and is made realy good. I recomend this pen to any body including teachers and any body who would need a red pen a pencil and black pen. Very nice"
2,It ain't what it used to be!,"It's a 3-in-1 and yet smaller than most pen. It uses a twist method that is much easier than having to tilt the pen like most all-in-1 pen. It also looks a lot better, is a lot lighter, and has hidden batter under the twist cap.What would I change about this pen?1. The twist cap hides the eraser, so that means it takes a while to get to the eraser.2. Add a stylus and make it a 4-in-1UPDATE 6/30/2012It's not what it used to be. Before, you were able to rotate forward and backward. Now, All that you can do is rotate it forward! They removed the reverse mechanism. So, it's like the new crappy tech 4 pen that can only rotate forward and not backward. Disappointed!"
3,Not as nice and impressive as it used to be,"I bought this pen to replace a similar one I'd had for years and recently lost...and boy I'm even more sorry about losing my old one than before. The new isn't bad, but it's definitely not on the same quality level as they used to be as several others review note. I wish they'd spent less money on the overdone packaging and invested that in maintaining the high quality Cross for which Cross used to be known. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice been, it's just not nearly as nice and impressive as it used to be."
3,Well Made But Without The Heft,"I actually returned this pen as I prefer pens with some heft, so that it feels like you have something substantial in your hand....this pen does not have that quality. It was too light for me, although it was made nicely and the mechanical function was flawless. If you prefer a light (in weight) writing utensil, this should meet your needs nicely."
3,OK Pen,"My problem with this pen is that it just doesn't feel right in my hand. It slides in my hand and that is not good. I should have opted for the black matte one because I think that would have cut down on said gripe. Maybe it is just my hand size, which is not huge by any means. Cross is a good manufacturer, I had another Cross that I really liked. This one is sound and the triple combination is nice to have. Well made but I wouldn't have purchased it if I had inspected it prior to purchase."
5,Good stylus and Good Pen,Stylus tip works great and the pen/pencil combo comes in handy. Only drawback is limited availability of pen tip types.
2,to small,The pen is smaller than it looks. Also the ink is not what i thought it would be...looks dull and not worth the money spent on it.
2,Cross Tech 3 Chrome Pen,"Cross Chrome/Tech 3 is OK but inferior to the Gold (no longer offered)Tech 3 I own.Two problems:1, pocket clip is weak and does not hold well in a dress shirt pocket and pen fallsout when you bend over.2, Moving through pencil, red pen and black pen sequence, are stiff and worse whenrverse is attempted."
5,Great office tool,"This pen fits in my hand just like a singular device would. It's slender and well balanced. A simple twist in either direction goes to the next option. The pens work just as expected with nice clear lines which don't smudge. The pencil is great as well. I've had the pen for about 2 weeks and would be lost without it. When looking for a multi-purpose writing instrument I bought this along with a PaperMate PhD Multi (Amazon B002R5AEOS). This is far superior and well worth the money for my usage. The slender nature of this pen makes it easy to slip in and out of my back pocket which is where I keep it while moving about the office. The PhD Multi is much larger and doesn't store as easily. This pen is well worth the extra money and a must have for those who routinely use red, black, and pencil."
4,Good pen,"I am very pleased with this product. I expected it to be a little heavier (I like pens that have a little weight to them), but within a day this one grew on me and I got acclimated very quickly to the feel. It does not smear/smudge and no ink left over on the tip when writing. VERY easy mechanism function for the different colors and feels like it will last a while. I had a multi-function pen that came with my DayRunner planner but the manufacturer has since gone out of business and I couldn't get refills so I opted to purchase a new multi-function. I actually got one for myself and one as a gift for my boss as she expressed interest in my old one. If only it had a highlighter, but I can live without that no more than I use it. I would recommend this pen to anyone. Great price, good name and a pleasure to do business with. It arrived within 2 days (I paid extra for 2 day shipping)and was in great shape."
4,Great novel to read!!!,"If you have an good mother like I was blessed with, I would like to recommend for you to read about other good mothers and the relationships that they have had with their children. This book was awesome. Thank God for mama's always being there inspite of the hurt and differences in our life!!!"
1,Looks good but doesnt work well,"I really like the look and size of this lock. It is just the right size and sturdiness for a gym locker. Unfortunately, the lock has a tendancy to have the code you set slip (meaning if you leave it open and throw it in your bag, the combination may change as it rolls around). I had this lock for about a week before I had to have it cut off because the combination was not what I had set it to be."
1,Awful!,"Because I love the musical, I paid the higher price for this album to get more songs. It seems to have been recorded with 10 year old technology. Stay away."
4,Basketball as five-man tai chi,"As winner of 2 three-peat basketball champions as coach of the Chicago Bulls, and now with the Lakers, you have to listen to his team approach as quest for spiritual depth in the game. Although perhaps more of interest to the basketball fan, Jackson's Zen-Christian-Lakota insights into the ego and anger of a high caliber (and $) team, and as a grand experiment with the truth (to paraphrase Thich Nhat Hanh). The use of Tex Winter's triangle offense (five-man tai chi), as a team building exercise was fascinating. His descriptions of his own awakening from a Pentecostal background, and continual striving to understand deeper principles and make mid-course correction not just to the team but himself. As he says, ""Being aware is more important that being smart"". A good read!"
4,Sacred Hoops was amusingly entertaining and inspirational.,"I found Sacred Hoops to be inspirational. Jackson conveys his philosophy well. There were not too many technical terms, and it was a fast read. The ideas Jackson has about how to create a real team, and the personal stories of his life and career illustrating his points, were amusing as well as thought provoking. Aplicable to daily life, as well as any team sport."
5,Zen and the Art of Basketball,"This book by Phil Jackson offers an interesting insight into how he has successfully managed to incorporate Zen and Native American philosophies into his coaching style. The traditional Zen concepts of ""compassion and selflessness,"" ""living in the moment,"" ""emptying the mind,"" etc., might not appear to have any place in the modern sports world, but after reading this book, I am convinced that they can be applied to almost any walk of life. Phil also talks about his own internal conflicts with his very Christian upbringing and his fascination with Zen concepts, and how he has finally managed to embrace both, and now considers himself a 'Zen Christian'. He walks us through the Chicago Bulls championship years using some very interesting anecdotes and aphorisms. Overall, the book is a great read."
3,Great coach doesn't win this time,"I love Phil Jackson and I was eager to read this book. I wanted to learn more about the Zen that inspires his coaching and philosophy. But you get little of that in the book. You do get some nice anecdotes about the Bulls championship runs, and you get a few ruminations on leadership. But there's little depth here at all. If Jackson has profound thoughts on life and coaching, he isn't able to get them across in this book."
4,Sacred Hoops- Sacred Book,"THis was a great book. I got so much out of it. It is definitely not just for basketball fans. The lessons Jackson teaches apply to everyday life, on or off the court. It was one of those books that sucks you in. It is an excellent book for athletes or mathletes because it teaches that we should show each other, and ourselves, some compassion."
4,Another autobio/how to improve your life book.,"Phil Jackson seems to be one of the more intelligent coaches in the game. His ability to get people to work together...his knowledge of what buttons to push and when to push them is to be admired. He writes of a season with the Bulls and how they overcame their trials and tribulations--not unlike Pat Riley's book ""The Winner Within."" However Jackson takes a deeper philosophical look at why and how things happened. Good as a retrospective of the season, very good as a book on life."
1,What is so great about this book?,"I can't imagine what the other reviewers like so much about this book. I was so glad when I finally finished it. I had no idea what it would be about and didn't know anything about Jonathan Carroll. This book was a complete waste of time. It's silly, boring, and meaningless."
2,Bizarre doesn't even describe it,"One of the most strange books I have ever read. Carroll jumps from one page to the next just making it up as he goes along.Unecessary Foul Language is used throughout the book. Real people do Not speak this way.The one thing that kept me reading is, the author really has a way with words. Beautifully written, save the 100s of ""F"" words throughout.When I was finished, I threw it in the trash. Didn't even bother to sell it on eBay. Too bad, Jonathan Carroll seems to have promise, if he can clean up his potty mouthed characters."
2,Earth to JC! Please phone home.....,"I've been a fan of Carroll's for years; sometimes felt I was the only person in on the secret. He defies the normal genre categories: his novels--beautifully written, teasingly plotted, quite often quite terrifying--combine horror and fantasy, flirt with matters metaphysical, don't ever entirely depart from the conventions of ""mainstream"" literary fiction. So it was extremely upsetting for me to find I just couldn't finish this book....just too whimsical, too exasperatingly arbitrary in its narrative development, too self-consciously darkly cute (or cutely dark). I want the Carroll who reminds me of Robert Aickman, not the Carroll who reminds me of a schizophrenic Walt Disney..."
3,An Entertaining Bit of Fluff,"The book jacket has a blurb which calls this ""a quirky piece of pop writing"" and that's about right. The author has fun throwing unexpected plot twists at you left and right, and the book has a palpable sense of fun. In fact, it might be compared to Spider Robinson's ""Callahan"" books in this regard.But in another regard it never really seemed to strive for anything greater. Although an entertaining bit of fluff, ultimately it was a bit lightweight and inconsequential. The story developed no internal logic, and the ending was just as airy as the rest. Unlike Robinson, Carroll seems content to float a plot in midair like a feather.Not a bad recommendation, if you're looking for a pleasant afternoon's read."
2,potential never realized,"The story seemed to have potential. Mr. Carroll knows how to write character and about the things that make the ordinary magical for average people like me. Yet all this potential is wasted in a story that is weaved to seem to unintentionally silly, confusing, and that in the end leaves you very unsatisfied.After reading this book I don't know if I want to chance my money on any of his other books."
2,Not Carroll's best,"I have high expectations for this book after reading Land of Laughs and Sleeping In Flames but I was rather disappointed.The story had Carroll's usual interesting characters and humourous dialogues but the story simply falls flat - loosely tied up, full of inconsequential subplots with absolutely no sensible or coherent connections."
4,Wooden mind reading more Carroll,"Thanks to Amazon's You may also like... I picked up this one, and now I think I have a new favorite author. This is a truly creative book with wonderful characters and a convoluted but engaging plot. Man takes in three legged dog. Dog dies but refuses to stay buried or dead. Man talks to aliens, time-travels, changes his life, and sees the Beatles. Tears, surprises, and just the right amout of hilarity thrown in. I'm glad Carroll has written so many, I won't have to wait to read his next one."
5,"""yum"" sums it up","I have been a big Carroll fan for about a year now, and have finally acquired all his books save one. So when I found out I could get a proof copy of this book online, I immediatley ordered it, and I think it's wonderful. I read it in one day, couldn't resist, even though I wanted to make the enjoyment last longer. if you've never read Jonathan Carroll, this book is a good introduction. If you have, I don't think you'll be disappointed. And as a side note in response to another review here, I did not notice any excessive vulgarity, and I cannot imagine why christian integrity would be relevant when writing about characters that aren't all Christian - or should I just say that if diversity offends you, perhaps Jonathan Carroll isn't for you at all. Anyone else would probably enjoy his books very much."
4,Foontageegee,"Yes, that's right, foontageegee. I finished this book Friday evening, then re-read it on Sunday. Then I emailed the author.Frannie McCabe is a briliantly written protaganist. As a small-town police cheif in his forties, he is mellow and happy. Young Frannie, however, is hell-on-wheels. The boy Frannie is sneaky and adventurous. And we meet them all in the period of a week.All of the Frannie's have a single purpose--to save the world. The problem is, they don't know how.Jonathan Carroll has written a rollicking good time that leaves you wanting more. This was the first of his books that I had read, and I will read more."
4,J. Carroll is a winner,"A charmingly presented book by a master of the mysterious. Somehowhe manages to make it seem less than expected, even when hisreputation for vanishing acts, unexplainable events, and unrealityall precede him. He is the American Haruki Murakami. He deservescredit for delivering a nice book. My only complaint is that itseemed over too soon."
4,A great book,"Great book! It was funny, sad, scary, and mysterious till the very last page. The story will have you demanding ""tell me why!"" throughout it, but Carroll keeps you guessing brilliantly until your about to pull your hair out. I would definitly recommend this book to everyone."
4,"This book was kind of crazy, but a lot of fun to read!","It was exciting and had some truly hilarious moments. The ending was a bit disappointing, but I am not sure that a more conclusive ending would have been any more satisfying, really. I think I enjoyed _Sleeping in Flame_ more, but this book was a lot of fun to read. It was very different... Although there was some acknowledgment given to _Back to the Future_, which was nice. I really did enjoy this and I do wish that there was more to the story overall... A sequel would be nice!"
3,Full of sound and fury,"Carroll piles on layers of intriguing mysteries, but the puzzle pieces never ultimately come together. This is a fun and well-written book, but it's better at the micro scale than the macro; the overall structure is shapeless and half-baked. Don't expect answers."
3,mayberry mystique,"This is the first Jonathan Carroll title I've ever read. I won't go into describing the plot, you can get that from the many reviews this book has already accumulated. I must admit, this book is inconsistent, there are times I had a very difficult time putting it down. Yet, other times, I literally dreaded picking up the book. I'm still processing my first experience of Carroll. I'm somewhat disappointed, and left wondering about too many loose ends, but I'm still willing to give him a another try because I can see the wonderful traits of an excellent author. I know from reading other reviews, Carroll is obviously very much loved by his fans and I do not wish to 'dog' him and I would very much like to see the side of his style that is so amazing. I do believe that this book is probably not the best of the list, nor is it the best one to begin reading for a first Carroll novel."
3,Great Characters With Real Potential; Falls Flat,"This is not Carroll's best work. Though packed with rich real characters and vivid surreal but somehow true situations that are the hallmark of Carroll's work, the book promises much more than it eventually delivers. If you must read it, consider stopping before the final chapters, otherwise try the Teeth of Angels or The Land of Laughs."
4,Wild Ride,"I really enjoyed The Wooden Sea. Without repeating the plot or giving away any spoilers, I loved the reason behind all of the odd happenings in Crane's View. The author does not wrap up the story in a bow. There are questions posed that remain unanswered - as well they should. That is the magic of the story. While there is no real sex in the book, the story has a sexuality to it - we can identify with Frannie McCabe because he thinks as everyman and lives as everyman. We should all get the opportunities that he has been given. I read the book in 2 days - I just couldn't put it down."
5,Great intro to Germs and Vaccinations,"I love The Animated Hero Classics by NEST Complete Learning Systems. The Quiz at the end, with three levels reinforce what has been taught, and I really appreciate that.The Louis Pasteur DVD introduced many things to my kids: Cholera, Rabies, Anthrax, Typhoid Fever, Vaccinations and the fact that dust carries germs. This lead to lots of Google searches and conversations on the subjects. They are now much more diligent in hand washing :)"
5,great lubrication with very little application,Just bought some more after using the same bottle for over 10 years. Use sparingly and it works well. Best valve oil out there
3,Opportunity wasted,"A great concept for a TV series about TV news production with all its dark spots and conflicts between market and truth has been wasted. Half of the time, this is excellent commentary on recent American politics (pleasingly anti tea party), but alas, the other half can't get away from the silliest love problems of the main characters. Enough already with your stupid hysteria about 'cheating' and the endlessly boring indecision of the younger staff about who they want to 'be with'."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I love the song ""NASCA LINES"" which I first heard on a Putamayo world music CD, so I ordered ""UNDER ONE SKY"" since it has ""Nasca Lines."" I figured all the music would be as good, but I was so disappointed. It was very jazzy, which I hate. I'm going back to the Putamayo CDs."
5,Awesome,"I have already reviewed the pc version of this game and there's not much difference. What more can I say about this fantastic game. I purchased the collector's edition, so there is a little difference in what the game comes with. The collector's edition comes with an additional dvd that shows basically how the game was made. It also comes with a small guide book to the world of Tamriel and its environs and a replica septim coin. Other that that, the game's the same. I have already beaten the main quest on this game and there are still quite literally hundreds, maybe thousands, of side-quests left. Can you say open-ended game play? Quite possibly the best rpg ever made."
5,i almost get divorced for playin this game,"this is true guys i have problems whit my wife for playin this game to many hours ,, but this game is the best ever,,,, you most play this game ,5 stars"
3,Seems like a good game... but just not my style.,"I bought this game because it has a lot of good reviews. But after playing it for a couple of hours, I got tired of it. It does not have a lot of action and RPG is not really my style. Only buy this game if you truly like Role Playing Games.The Collector's Edition comes with some cool stuff. If your mind is set in purchasing this game, definately get the Collector's Edition, the extras are worth it!"
1,This game does NOT work outside of the US,We could not get this game to work so we obviously did not have much fun with this game. I bought this game for my sister's boys in Sweden and I brought it there myself as birthday present. They have an Xbox 360. Unfortunately they could never use the game because of some idiotic limitation built by Microsoft in not allowing US Xbox 360 games to work on European Xbox 360 machines and vice versa. Amazon site and product info there does not make that clear at all. I had no idea. There is no way of knowing this. I think this stinks. My sister's boys were really dissappointed in not being able to play this game and the game sits now and collects dust. They and I are very upset.
5,Praise from the neophyte,"I am fairly new to the role playing games myself. And having never played any of the precursors to this game, I was going to just allow it to pass me by at first. Until a friend of mine talked me into it, it has been the best buy for my 360 yet!For someone new to the games the first person view takes a little getting used to, but after you master that, the world is your playground. There are so many ways to customize your play and character (I must confess I spent at least an hour just creating my character). This game has left me wanting for absolutely nothing, from the perfectly synced conversations and breathtaking graphics, to the vast character development options. This has to be one of the greatest games out there."
5,"Never really ""got"" Morrowind, but this is AMAZING.","I'm one of those people that just never really ""got"" Morrowind. My friends played it, and raved about the open ended gameplay, the immersive world, etc. etc. I watched a few people play it for an hour or so, but never really had a desire to pick it up.Fast forward a bit, to the release day of Oblivion. I'm strolling through the store and see a copy of the Collector's edition sitting on the shelf. I've finished most of the games I picked up for the 360 when I bought it, so I grabbed it on an impulse. I am so glad I did.After the first few minutes, I was hooked. The graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is interesting. This is probably the closest I've ever felt to being dropped into a real functioning world through a video game.I'm not really sure what else to say. There's enough game here to keep anyone busy for a long, long time."
5,WOW,"This is a must own if you have a 360!! the game goes ahead and exemplifies what the next gen system is supposed to provide. lush graphics, great environments, and a story!!! the game does have a few problems with loading, but as far as i'm concerned it means nothing with such a wonderful game! the rpgs for the next gen systems will have to look up at this game and have my drooling at the mouth to see where they will lead!"
5,Loved it!!!,"I've heard the Suburban Love Junkies live many times, and each time leaves me wanting more and more. This album's the next best thing. Their harmonies and melodies are amazing, and their lyrics can be humorous or hauntingly beautiful. If you ever have the opportunity to see these guys in concert - don't miss it, and please tell them to come play in South Carolina again soon!!!!"
2,Stinky....,"Mediocre AOR, Sounds like a couple of local yokels with big budgets and no talent. At the least the bargain bin section won't get so lonely with these guys around..."
4,A Nice Selection of Easy-to-Follow Recipes,"This book has a nice combination of tried-and-true favorites (corn muffins, banana bread) and creative, newer recipes (Buckwheat bread, triple-chocolate muffins). I've tried several and I always get rave reviews. The oatmeal raisin made with buttermilk is a standard at office parties. The recipes are easy and every recipe is pictured in color! I think this book is great additon to any cooks collection."
3,Errors in ingredient quantities,Be careful as you mix from this book. It makes me wonder whether the previous reviewers actually used the recipes to make muffins.

4,Good cultural insight,I liked the film. I was in Germany during this time and I thought it reflected well some of the student controversy which was evolving in 1987.
3,"Fun, but. . .","As another reviewer stated, if you can put your ethics on hold for a couple of hours, this film is fun and entertaining.The problem arises when one remembers the vicious murders by the Red Brigades and other communist and anarchist groups in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.Perhaps there are some topics that simply shouldn't be fodder for comedy."
2,A Childish Attempt,"When I read about the movie I pictured it to be very differnt than what it really was. I was disapointed to find that it reminded me of some kind of teen flick, although I can't really put my finger on why. The charartors felt sterotypical and it seemed you were always one step ahead of them because the movie was never even slightly subtle. Overall the movie is pradictable and therefore boring."
1,Highly disappointed,I thought this product would make my skin soft and moisturized. Boy was I wrong! Dove soap is way better than this brand if you're looking to have moisturized skin at the end of your shower. This soap left my skin extremely dry and itchy. I used it once and never used it again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
4,"Good voucher, so-so CD","Voucher is good, just as advertised. It was the lowest price I could find on the Internet. Amazon delivered it to me on the 7th day after I placed the order. Don't expect much for the sample questions on the CD though. I had to manually register a bunch of ocx to make the practice test program work. After that much trouble, it gave me only 10 questions per exam!"
4,It met all expectations,The voucher worked like advertised. If you read the description it tells you that it can only be used at VUE testing centers. I don't understand what the others are complaining about. Just make sure there is a testing center near you. My only suggestion to Amazon would be to eliminate the delivery by mail. All you need is the voucher number. Amazon should be able to email it to you instead of mailing it.
3,Check the publisher DATE!!!!!,"These vouchers are perfectly good, and a good price. The prep software is mediocre, but basically you're getting it for nothing. HOWEVER, be aware the vouchers are good for one year from the date they were ""published"" NOT one year from when you buy them. So be sure to look in the details section where it says the publisher is Microsoft and has a date -- the voucher is good until one year after that."
2,WATCH OUT! Not valid at Sylvan Prometric Testing centers...,This voucher is ONLY good at VUE testing centers - not Sylvan Prometric! Be sure you know where you want to take your exam BEFORE even CONSIDERING this voucher!
1,You should be ashamed,"This is essentially ""dirty pool."" The above reviewer is absolutely correct, at first glance it looks like a great deal, but after shipping costs and tax the cost is greater than the actual exam fee.Ridiculous!Oh but I suppose the free CD Jewel Case might be worth it..."
1,surani,aziz ullah sir i am buying this book but we are in pakistan iam where buy this book plz sir comform me i am from hope you.
2,Be aware of Shipping,"I ordered on Dec 17th and still haven't received it yet on Dec 30th. I am amazed at the way amazon delivers the voucher. Why don't amazon just put the voucher number in an email, or list in the order history? Save itself shipping and save us time."
2,Whatever...still a rip off...,"Some of you are right, with taxes and shipping, it's not worth it. This is hardly a discount at all. I'd rather see the exam fees themselves drop back down to $100 like there were only a couple of years ago.Between the books, exam fees, and declining/accompanying lack of respect for certifications, I think the IT ""training"" industry is a complete joke. I'm almost embarrassed to be participating in it but like the rest of you, have little choice.Good luck to everyone!"
1,Not save money after sales tax!,"At first look, you will save 10$ for the MCP test if you buy this voucher, because usually you will have to pay $125 for one MCP test.But after I check out, I found you have to pay the sales tax in WA (8.8%), so the total amount is even more than 125$!I would rather not buy the voucher here!"
3,"wait, and wait, and ...","I cancelled my order after waiting 3 weeks. I ordered the discounted voucher twice before and both times had it in about a week, but this time I couldn't wait any longer."
2,"Ok, could do better","Watch your local geography!1) Some places have more vue centers, other places it is eaiser to find prometric.2) As mentioned by others, watch sales tax. It may actually cost you more, or you may save.3) Consider getting a voucher with a ""short shelf life"". Vue vouchers for MS can (sometimes) be found with instant electronic delivery for less then $90. @ getcertify4less.com You have to be careful as there is usually only a week or two left before the voucher becomes worthless."
1,Saved a whopping three dollars,"After tax, which I don't pay when registering on the phone, I saved three dollars and change. Then I had to jump through the hoops of registering online. Definitely not worth the time involved in ordering, waiting for shipment, etc."
4,Great Business Advice,"I am a retired aerospace engineer experiencing a ""second life"" as a woodworker/carpenter. Of all the finish carpentry books I have looked at, this one is better suited to the person going into the business (I am contemplating it). It offers a decent overview of the range of projects a carpenter will be called upon to do, and serves as a good general reference, though it takes on too wide a scope to go into much detail on all the topics it tackles. However, the last chapter, ""Setting Up a Subcontractor Finishwork Business,"" is worth the cost of the book for someone who wants to learn about contracts, billing, and some of the management issues involved, which may be even more intimidating than the hands-on work. If you really get serious about the business, however, be sure to check out David Gerstel's ""Builder's Guide to Running a Successfil Construction Company."""
5,"Starting a New Carpentry Business, This Is The Book To Get","I started a new carpentry business a while ago. This book really helped me out. Business wise, from figuring manhours, to giving job estimates and to actualy earning money. Skillfull tips such as scribing a jambless window sill and coping crown moulding. I've read many books on this topic, but I have to say this is one of the ""best""."
3,Light Hidden under a Bushel,"The Finish Carpenter's manual has many great tips, including estimating procedures and good business advice. It is obviously written by a master carpenter, but just as obviously has not been touched by a professional designer or editor.Mr. Tolpin launches directly into step-by step instructions for complex operations. He refers to materials, methods and tools that may not be familiar to the layman, or even to experienced regional craftsmen. There is no glossary and the index is misleading, but, some pages after the subject is brought up, the reader may happen on illustrations and explanations that will ease the bewilderment.If the material were rearranged to start with well-annotated pictures, then clear definitions and finally instructions, it would be much more valuable."
2,Dated and overpriced,"Don't let the cover fool you. This volume is dated in style and content. About 65% of it needs to be updated or written more effectively. The writer's original intent was good but not totally achieved. Passing years have eroded that mediocrity. An expanded revision could produce a solid classic, instead of an aging, overpriced tomb."
1,Cheap Junk,"These were plastic junk, color was an ugly cream color. Sent them back and only got credit for one pair. Was taked for $15.31 that was not refunded. Will never purchase again and have let all our family and friends know."
1,Not for my dog,My dog squints when the sun is out and he looks so miserable. His eyes water too. So I decided to try out these Doggles. They fit fine...and most of the time he would actually leave them on. But they didn't help with the squinting or the eye watering. My $5 sunglasses blocked more bright light then these do.
5,My baby dog loves these,She loves to ride in the car and when she has these on she seems toasty out liner as the wind does not bother her eyes.
2,Outdated footage and inappropriate age range,"The age range on this DVD says ages 2+. My 3 year old son who loves planes, and generally enters a zombie-like state when watching TV, was bored within 5 mins of this video. There are interviews with pilots which are very much lost on a toddler that needs action and kid-friendly voices. This may be better for a 8-year old or older. Also, the video footage looks like a series of videos from the 1980's that has been pieced together. I would not recommend for anyone under 8 and even then, it's questionable."
2,Bar Mitzvah elevator music,"After reading the other reviews, I expected a really great CD and I should have listened to the sample tracks before ordering. But we have a dial-up connection and it takes forever!So anyway, there are a lot of songs on this CD, but they aren't done in any kind of traditional style. There's this odd disco-type back beat and very strange arrangements. Imagine Donna Summer and the WASP-girl singers meet Montivani.I would never play this CD for any of my guests, but if you like very non-traditional arrangements of Jewish standards and party music, this may be for you."
4,unjustly neglected,"It surprises me that this date from WSQ has not yet been commented upon. It's a solid outing, one which includes Mor Thiam and other legendary African drummers. Also noteworythy is Oliver Lake's poetry on ""Dakar Darkness,"" which was written by David Murray. David's bass clarinet playing on that tune is elegant and powerful. Strongly recommended."
3,"Great read, needs first and third in series to fill out","This book is a great sci-fi read, but the first and third in the series are critical so that you're not lost. It reads well as a standalone, if you don't mind that fact, but as a trilogy, this book and Starrigger and Paradox Alley make a fantastic weekend read."
4,Good to have,It's def. a good tool to improve your accent once you have a good vocabulary and are fluent.
2,I wouldn't recommend it!!!!!!!!!!,"The selected material is the same as any other accent modification course I have seen; it is not bad at all. However, the teaching method is not good. It seems like she tried to invent the wheel again. I like the course by Jane Wilburn. She seems to be an expert both in American Accent and teaching."
1,I didn't like it!,"I was little dissapointed about this CD. I expected something more helpful, but it's confused and boring.Don't try!"
1,They stole from me I did not get my order nor return of my money,"America beware of the mirrage sallers on amazon like this people, once they get your money, you do not have any business with them."
1,Technically poor and hard to understand,The CD set does not meet the expectations. It starts with some basic vowel lessons which are technically and quality-wise absolutely horrible. It is very annoying to have like patched little sequences with abrupt transitions. Unfortunately also the content itself and the spelling are not as clear as necessary so it is very hard to distinguish the pronounciation of similar vowels.I can not recommend this CD's. The ranking is zero stars.
2,Had to Go,Played on these for months without realizing why I didn't like my tone. Eventually replaced them. Glad I did.
3,Krauthogs,"I hate how the term Krautrock is used in slapdash manner to describe any music produced in Germany in the late 60's and 70's. The truth is that Guru Guru are simply not fit to lace the boots of the best German bands of the period but they, and others far worse, have attained some degree of critcal cool simply by being descibed as ""Krautrock"". Again, Guru Guru are not the worst of these spurious ""Krautrock"" groups (for instance Kraan are far less interesting) and this might be their best album. The tracks consist of jams stuck together, haphazardly at times but quite entertainingly too, built around Mani Neumeier's octopus-armed drumming, occasional vocalising and layers and layers of Ax (what a name for a guitarist!) Genrich's hyperactive guitar. The overall effect is not unlike a more spaced out Groundhogs! Again, not even remotely essential, but quite groovy nonetheless."
4,Great Story,This is an inspiring story...and it makes a great movie. It's forgiveness to the Nth degree!
4,End of the Spear,"Awesome, I saw the movie first but this book is more from the missionaries view. I read Through Gates of Splendor years ago and it's great to know the sequel."
4,A few downsides of the book,"I like this book. I agree with the positive reviews here, but the book is not 100% flawless. Saint appears to be a numerologist: he assigns a mystical significance to every number he encounters, ascribing it to destiny or fate. It makes him seem needlessly superstitious, although his musings don't seem to affect his actions or the story in any way.Also, the book's layout, jumping between three and sometimes four time periods, with flashbacks within flashbacks, is somewhat confusing. I'd have liked an editor to go over it again."
2,Very Dull,"This book had all of the markings of a good true story, but it was written more like a diary, and not a very interesting one at that. A lot of it did not ring true."
3,generally its ok,it doesnt really tell much about how and why steve saints father (nate saint) died but over all its ok
4,A kid's review,"The End of the SpearBy Steve SaintA Kid's ReviewSteve's father was killed by Alka or naked savages also known as Waodani. The Waodani live in tribes in the Amazon jungle and fight amongst themselves. When Steve was only five years old his father was killed by the Waodani. The Waodani took him in as family. Now he teaches the Waodani about things from the outside world because it will help them. I feel the author of this book is trying to tell that God can turn something bad into something good. I really like this book because it is godly, adventurous and a true story. I like characteristics about books like this one. I recommend reading it because it is really really really awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Review by Tanner Evans"
4,Comprehensive,"Thompson was a truly great scholar. Admittedly, he wasn't perfect-- he got some concepts wrong, but on the whole he contributed a mountain of information to Mayanology without which the field would be much poorer. This work is almost encyclopedic in its detailed inclusiveness. Definitely recommended."
4,Excellent Overview of History of Discoveries in Quantum Phys,A deep but essentially non mathematical overview of the progression of scientific theories relating to Quantum Physics. The thesis of the book was to refute the popular idea that recent discoveries in Quantum Mechanics have merged with and in fact provide a scientific support for metaphysical/religious philosophies. This to me was the less interesting part of the book. IN making his arguments Stenger takes the reader through a chronological history of the major discoveries in Quantum Physics. Although very deep for someone not trained in this discipline it is mostly understandable. The non mathematical reader is left hanging in a few places but overall one emerges with a general understanding of the important debates of the day in this field
3,STAY AWAY FROM THIS!,"Are some of you people NUTS?!!!How can you POSSIBLY go crazy over this game and give it blazing reviews?!What do you really like? The annoying as hell camera angles?The horrible PS1-Resident Evil style dialogue???The fact that you can never be too camoflauged or quiet enough for enemies and your seen in seconds, with no chance????Could it be the history lessons that you MUST sit through? I swear in 2 hours of straight play you MUSt bore through an hour and a half of mindless chit chat and bad video!!!!Is it the sega genesis style AI enemies???You people are so in love with MTS series that you are fooling yourself with this crap!Its almost degrading and humiliating when someone is watching you play this game!It is more annoying than trying to remove a splinter you can hardly see but feel is there! Wake the heck up guys.....PROS - Graphics CAn be good in some levels....thats the only PRO.....well that and you can rent it to see how bad it is for yourself."
3,What?,The game hasnt even came out yet and your already writing reviews. Ah crap this is a review isnt it...
1,I PAID TO PLAY A GAME NOT TO WATCH IT,"TOO MUCH 'WATCHING' NOT ENOUGH PLAYING.ITS LIKE A MOVIE, A $50 MOVIE. COMPANY COMPENSATES BY PUTTING CINEMA SCENES IN A VIDEO GAME.TALK ABOUT LAZY. WASTE OF MONEY.WITHOUT ALL OF THE CUT SCENES, THE GAME IS MAYBE 4 HOURS. WHAT A RIPOFF."
5,"wow, they managed to fit ape escape in here","i work at the local gamestop, and i was originally just going to take this game home to try it and see what its like. from the openning cut scene i was in love. the graphics are incredible for such a large game. i love how you can change costumes and face paint for better camoflage. the weapons kick major tail, the characters are just the right amount campy and not annoying, and the fact you actually have to hunt for survival is awesome, and it is pulled off very well. the biggest surprise of this game was the inclusion of an ape escape mini game. you get a gun called the monkey spanker and you have to capture a certain amount of monkeys. and the best part is they are the actual monkeys from ape escape.this is a great stealth game, and its not as restrictive as splinter cell. definatly a great game to get for the holidays."
2,"great cinematics, really bad angles....","im gonna have to go against all mgs fans....the games very frustating...while the graphics and storyline are really great ,,its a very difficult game...while the object of the game is to stay invicible to the eye of the enemy,,i had to drag myself thru the whole game,cause as soon as i got on my knees, i was spotted....i think the a.i was overdone,,i know its important in games,but this is ridiculous...not to the point of draging my a## thru the whole stages....the camouflage doesn't work to well either....the angles are really really terrible...enemies come from all over the place yes 360 degrees...sometimes youre laying down and you dont have time to even turn around , and once you do its all over ( spotted!!)enemies are really hard to grab as well....to me this is a dissapointment ,,and for sure nothing compare to sons of liberty......dont waste your money on this puppy, just rent if anything....."
1,Terrible.,"I'd never played a MGS game before, started with this one. This game is god awful. I won't bother going into detail; it's already covered in the negative reviews here."
1,"mgs= great, mgs2= bad, mgs3= bad","the reasons for the low rating have been covered: horrible camera angles, etc. just not a very good game. mgs was great but the last two have been horrible and not a lot of fun.avoid"
3,repetitive,This game just cant stand up to the new fast paced action games. I figured that out when part II came out at the same time as devil may cry. I couldnt go back to Mr. Slowpoke.
2,why?,"ok i got this game for christmas and was really looking foward to playing it, then i played it and was i dissapointed, whats up with the overhead camera view it sucks, ruins the whole game, they should of just stoped at metal gear solid 2.anyone want a free game, cause i would feel bad charging someone for a cheap ass game."
2,Inexcusably Horrible Camera,"This game had so much potential, so much hype, and it did not deliver up to the expectation whatsoever. The horrendous camera angle/system completely distorts the gameplay, making it next to impossible to engage in combat effectively. The overhead camera cannot be rotated, which means you cannot see more than 10 feet in front of you unless you go into 1st person perspective, but if you do so, you cannot move.I really hoped this game would be much better, but sadly it is extremely disappointing experience. Do yourself a favor and rent before you buy."
2,Not up to the hype,"Thank god I rented this game first. I'd be committing suicide right now if I'd actually thrown away fifty-buck on this trash. This was suppose to be the game of the year but it's terrible. I've seen better game for playstation 1. The camera angles (what camera angle?) are offal. You can't even tell where the enemy is half the time. But that doesn't really matter you can run around for hours being shot up and not die, how realistic is that?The dialogue is so cheesy it makes you want to vomit. The conversations between snake and the other characters are redundant and go on forever. The graphics are okay; not great but good. I can't imagine why people compare this game to splinter cell. You might as well compare Mario brothers 1 to splinter cell while you're at it. They couldn't be more different. Don't buy this game, take your money and buy a real stealth game like 'Thief, deadly shadows' or 'Splinter cell, Pandora Tomorrow' instead."
5,Best MGS to date,"I've had MGS3 since it came out, but finally came around to write the review. Let me tell you this game is incredible. Everything is completly amazing. The graphics, plot, well everything. Well the only downside is the notorious bad camera. Everybody has been complaing about that since the first one. But if you look past that you will immerse yourself in one of the best games to date to grace any system.pros: graphicsplotgameplayits MGScons: camerasometimes chuggs in big spaces"
4,MGS-3 awesome,"The storyline was cool kill volgin, the boss, blowing up a nuke tank launcher, and breaking out sokolove. But i didn't like the stand still to aim and birds eye view. It took time to get used to. The fighting was amazing human shields, slitting throats throwing snakes on people and all that stuff. Buy this game."
5,COOL GAME,THIS IS A COOL GAME METAL GEAR SOLID 3 WITH COOL CHARACTERS AND COOL CHARACTER MAJOR RAIKOV
3,"Good, but not all good","A good game, but not a great game. It has a lot of replayability, but I played it through once and won't be playing it through again. It's fun in spots, but then there are so many other parts that just aren't that much fun. You've got to have patience to play this and that doesn't seem good trait for a game - shouldn't it just be plain fun?? Good story, unlike Metal Gear Solid 2, and overall better than MGS2, so if you like MGS2 you'll like MGS3. All the annoyances are still there though (like the long boring radio conversations) and now more, like needing to find and ""eat"" food, change camo, and the ever restrictive camera which can get very frustrating!"
3,Same Old But A Bit Tedious,"The first Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary. The second Sons of Liberty was a cinematic experience coupled with excellent gameplay. Snake Eater, however, is much of the same but gets a little tedious. You will do much of the same, except the tedious part is that you have to keep eating to maintain your health, and you have to heal certain wounds. These elements made the game somewhat more ""real"" at first, but ended up being quite tedious and unnecessary as the game progresses. Towards the end, I found the gaming experience to be more of a chore than a giddy action experience. Play this game if you love Metal Gear and want more scenarios to exercise your Metal Gear maneuvaribility, but otherwise, just replay Solid or Sons of Liberty in more advanced modes."
3,The wierdest thing You have to hear Period!,The biggest surprise for this game Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater was that the person who helped write or Produced it was actually working for Godzilla Final Wars was that he decided to honor the 50th Birthday of Godzilla in Metal Gear Solid 3.
5,One of the Best Games Ever Made,"I bought this game to play on my PS3 since I had sold my original copy a long time ago. Worked great, until my PS3 died and I lost backward compatibility with the purchase of a new system. Thank goodness the HD Collection has been released!"
2,Not For Me,"I'm always on the hunt for a great deodorant that keeps me dry and smelling good. I realize this is a natural product and will be different than name brands, but I just didn't find it effective for me. For one, the texture was a little slimy and it was even a little on the messy side. Another problem I had was that my sensitive skin had some reaction to it. By the end of the day, I didn't really feel like I had anything on and would end up re-applying.It might be great for some, but I am still on the hunt for the perfect deodorant."
3,"not for summer use, maybe winter","I bought this at Sprouts, my first natural deodorant. I was so excited. Tried it on in the evening after showering of course, it was sticky But stickiness went away after about 20 min. but smelled so fresh. I loved the freshness. Then the next day within 3 hrs I just stank! I was so disappointed. I don't know if its my body rejecting it or its just not ment to be worn in the summer over 90 degree weather. I don't want to have to re-apply 5x a day. Just bought a fragrance free kiss my face deodorant hopefully that works and will try earth science again in the winter."
2,Not a great smell for a girl,"The product works well enough, but the scent is really not that appealing to me. It's not feminine enough :("
4,"Natal, christimas with SIMONE","Christimas songs , but in SIMONE 'S voz. From 1995, this cd sold in Brasil more than 1,5 milion albuns, portuguse version. As good as in portuguese.But i like better in portuguse version, specially the song by Roberto Carlos Sentimentos."
5,Definately is the Best of the Best!,"This CD is the best I have of Hall and Oates, and actually, the best I have out of all my CD's. It has songs for every different mood at any given time. I purchased this CD about a month ago, and I love it! A lot of the songs, bought back many great memories. Sometimes I would hear a song and think, I've heard this before and I love it...I didn't know it was by Hall and Oates. This is definately a classic for all you Hall and Oates lovers, and a must for others who love 80's pop."
1,Warning about galvanized metal,"Hi. I just wanted to warn dog owners about the danger of using galvanized metal for feeding or watering their dog. Galvanized metal has a coating of zinc which will leach into the water at a toxic level. Probably should also bypass the plastic waterer since they also leach pthalates and coloring into the water, especially if the waterer will be exposed to sunlight. Your dog deserves fresh, pure water so please buy the stainless steel automatic dog waterer. Toxins in the water may not make your dog acutely sick, but will degrade his/her health over time. sp"
1,I have to disagree...,"I'll have to disagree with the reviews to date. The author lost my interest within the first 30 pages by having a ""6'6"" cop wearing a frilly apron"" deliver a cup tea to the lover of the murder victim (having told her the bad news on the phone after which she faints and he has to break into her house to revive her) NOW REALLY! and this is our protagonist and her right hand man. Too much melodrama and not enough reality for me."
4,Interesting look at a small town venue,I thought this documentary showed a lot of history about a club and what it takes to begin a business like that. It had a pretty detailed account of some of the problems that come up and the spirit to begin such a venture. I found it fun to watch and a great portrayal of a city that seems to only get credit for it's amish population. Definitely worth checking out!
1,is a scam,"measures and the price on offer make it seem like they are 2 dampers and sold only 1, the measures specified boxes are not the actual product"
2,I am very annoy,"I am not satisfied with this Item, couple days ago I get 2 shock from 4 I pay for, and then, they sent the other 2 product are missed, but now I have to return the other two parts I have know, If I do not send this two they will charge on my credic card if I keep this Item, I not happey with this I need the four shocks of my car, please do not make any extra charge on this item."
5,Another home run for Lustbader,"FLOATING CITY not only has the best title of any of Lustbader's three dozen other books, but it's also another excellent read, as most of his novels are (nobody bats a thousand). Representing the second volume in a trilogy involving the venerable Nicholas Linnear battling the Yakusa and the Mafia, this novel improves upon its predecessor THE KAISHO, a fine book itself. I started reading reading this immediately after KAISHO.FLOATING CITY starts at a quick pace and maintains that pace till the last page. Lustbader has as little compunction for killing off characters as George R.R. Martin. I've already started SECOND SKIN, the third and final book in this series. After finishing that I'll move straight to DARK HOMECOMING featuring Linnear's friend Lew Croaker, a character as compelling as Linnear. I can't wait."
4,To discover your enemies in Southeast asia is not easy,Do not underestimate the power of money and corruption is a message sent out in this novel. The most dangerous assasin to you is often the one closest to you. This tale of deceit draws the reader throughout the world from the heartlands of the US to the depths of Indochina. Nicholas Linnear must infiltrate the latter area alone to face his enemey who has power unknown to many which Nicholas must overcome. Probably one of Eric Lustbaders best!
1,Dissapointing!!,"Having read Ninja and White Ninja I came upon this book and proceeded to read with great enthusiasm.The first quarter of the book's not to bad infact it revs up the tone of the excitement pretty well like the preceding novels.Then all of a sudden it becomes quite tedious and I'm sorry to add boring.The charm,uniqueness and eloquence of the hero's world exemplified in the other novels just dies out of this one.The enemies Linnear has confronted and pitted his wits and strength against with have been interesting and well thought out.The antagonist in this one is not as complex or believable this time around.However as consolation the Leonforte character is quite impressive though he plays a small part.Towards the end the book just becomes more and more dissapointing.When I was through I wasn't compelled to pick it up again.If this is what one is to expect from the rest of the series I'd rather leave it here.."
3,It was OK but not all that.,"I thought the book was good but not what I expected. I am not used to reading international books and I think that might be why I didn't enjoy as much as others. I had a little trouble remembering who was who because all those foreign names sound alike to me. Overall, I'd say it was a good read."
1,Really bad romance,"Seldom have I read a book so full of cliches or with a thinner plot! You certainly won't need a weekend to read it in full and even less time if, like me, you give up halfway through.Avoid unless you really really need a complete no-brainer read."
2,Shallow!!,"Even though the reviews say the book is short I still couldn't believe HOW short. This is a novella, a one-issue story without any real depth. Even so, shortness is no reason to have shallow characters (a 3-page short story can present a fully-realized, engaging character) and these two women were shallow. They had no complexity at all in their thought processes beyond ""She's beautiful! Oh, I'm in love!""I didn't want to know them and most romance novels make me yearn to meet the characters. I wouldn't recommend this at all. If you like shorter reads with more emotional depth, I'd recommend Peggy Herring."
5,Short good read,"Since Boone has written a novel of longer length, it seems this book was intended to be a short read. The characters are appealing and the story is well driven, but suffers from underdevelopment. Everything has to happen at a quick pace because the book is short. If you want to read a longer book on the same theme, try Karin Kallmaker's book Watermark."
2,HoHum!,As other reviewers have mentioned this book is short and the story is mirrors the brevity of the pages. I might have been more engaged if the author had provided more information on the protagnists.
3,"Good premise, not long enough","Overall, this book is a cute romance. However, the author could have developed the plot and the characters a lot more. The premise was great but I didn't like the Brady Bunch treatment of the story. The challenges and conflicts faced by the two protagonists were resolved too easily and much too quickly. Not bad if you're looking for a quick read that won't make you think too much."
5,christian book,"This book is great, and is even better when you fast before reading it. I passed it one of my Soldier and she passed it to someone else, and its circulating our whole camp.I would buy another book from this author. The author explains the contents of this book in very understandable terms, even my 8 year daughter can read it with ease.I grew up spiritually after reading this book, and I thank God someone recommend it to me."
2,Fail in the book,"I didn't understood why a book like this, that was published by McGraw Hill don't have a bibliography. I considered this a big fail in this book 'cause we can't know if what the author wrote was only his experience or if he had based his book on other books and articles."
3,Betty Crocker Buffets,An older cookbook. Has some good recipes in it. I would say it is an okay book. Some good pictures.
1,This Course is Bad,"This course makes no attempt to teach anything but conversational Jordanian Arabic and it does a poor job of that. It gives me a headache! It briefly teaches a point of grammar, then throws a lot of words at you, then gives you some drills that you won't figure out unless you go back and memorize all the words. That's slow and boring and you could do better having words introduced in conversations. The series does well with other languages. ""Italian in Three Months,"" for example, is excellent. ""Arabic in Three Months"" very much needs to be revised."
3,Manuka Oil,I've been using it for almost 2 weeks now and i havn't seen any results yet. Might work on some people not all.
1,Just a load of LIES,"this oil doesn't help ANY condition. You're better off buying Neosporin. It smells like crap and dead meat and I suspect all the ""positive"" reviews were written by friends and New Zealand ""patriots"". Don't waste your money...You need a gas mask to bear the smell alone."
