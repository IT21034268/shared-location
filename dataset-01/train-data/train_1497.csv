3,Not Bad,"Have Watched the series numerous time, good but not as good as the first series.Didn't have a Blu-Ray Player to watch it on."
3,"Very good, but...","I am not going to write a review on the actual FMA:Brotherhood series, but the Blu-Ray content I received. As a bilingual speaker (English and Japanese) I was looking forward to buying the DVD and being able to watch it in Japanese with no annoying English subtitles. It turns out that once you set the audio to Japanese, you have to watch the English subtitles as well. It is really disappointing seeing as how I paid money to watch what I could see on Hulu instead. I bought it hoping to be able to watch it without subtitles. My other DVD's allow me to do that so I don't understand why I can't on this one. It's a shame I even opened it because I can't return it now. Otherwise, the quality is of the Blu-Ray is very good and I think shows a clear image."
5,Great remake!,"This is a fantastic remake of the first Fullmetal Alchemist. It's even better than the first one, which I loved. I would definitely recommend buying this if you liked the first one. It's more detailed and closer to the manga than the original as well."
3,"great anime,but..","i like the anime,but it has a minor flaw.the english subtitle did not sync well with the japanese dialogue.there's always 1-2 seconds of lagging .i do hope the company will notice and correct it."
2,"Great Series, Minus the first 12 episodes","First off FMA: Brotherhood is an absolutely fantastic series. That being said the first 12 episodes of this series are just a very poor rehashing of what was significantly more episodes in the original anime. Once you are past the first twelve episodes of this series it's better than the original in almost every way. However since this set is episodes 1-15, if you have seen the first anime you may be better off skipping the first round of this series."
2,Skip volume 1,"While the first FMA anime was untrue to the manga, it weaved its own story and found a way or what I felt at the time had become better then the manga. The first 13 episodes of FMA: Brotherhood are trash and just a retelling of the first part of the original anime. They fail to keep the same sense of wonder and suffer from horrible pacing. I recommend just getting volume 2-5 as they are completely well paced and amazing and now looking back on the experiences showed that both series had their ups and downs while showing us two of the greatest stories ever told and theybshould be considered equals instead of trying to compare one another."
3,Work Great,"When I first took these, I was having stomach pain...then someone suggested I take a half one at a time..and it worked. Now that I am used to them, I can take a whole one. I had a gastric bypass in 2001 and do not absorb nutrients properly, but this seems to help me absorb my vitamins better."
2,"This stuff may work, but...","I bought this because it is said that it helps the body absorb certain supplement better.However I found that when using it, it gives me heartburn or discomfort in my digestive tract.This may not be true for you, and I encourage you to try for yourself because if you can tolerate it, it seems to be a good thing to take along with certain supplements to help your body utilize them better.For me it gives me too much discomfort, even when I cut the tabs in half. Sometimes I can tolerate it, but sometimes not. YMMV."
2,"Disappointed in this version of ""low carb""","I was surprised at how much cooking with fast-acting carbohydrate flours this book required. It was meatless as the title promises but the sheer number of carbs in each recipe forced me to give it up before I had the opportunity to cook with it. As a reformed bread-a-holic, I miss the richness of baking foods but this was not at all safe for my diet's quest of real low carb, low glycemic foods."
4,T MARTIN,IF U LIKE TO SEE A LOT OF CARS DOIN COOKIES ITS FOR U THATS ALL THEY DOIN HOGS AND HOES WAS A LOT BETTER BY FRENCH BRAIDS FROM THE BAY ALSO
1,you do not have to buy this,"The renditions of Rated X are very poor. I do not even understand why the mixers felt compelled to speak louder than Miles in the music? Unfortunately Amazon does not sell Get Up With It which features Rated X...those who know the tune, stay away from this album. On the Corner and SHH were pretty good, they demonstrate a better accomplishment in mixing the music of Miles."
1,may I puke now?,"the problem with the 20 something generation these days is thatthey've got short attention spans. they want everything fast without having to listen. they just want their STOOPID techno beat. if miles were alive today, its likely he would be turned on by the new things in music. but it would be done his way. and would never sound anything like this. dj spams (cam)version of ""in a silent way"" is a disgracei hope my rating shows ( - )(it doesn't (...)). its sad that some people will actually believe this IS miles. WE WANT MILES, not spew from a turntable ."
3,Miles From Miles,"The album is the follow-up to Bill Laswell's Panthalassa: The Music of Miles Davis, 1969-1974, and are remixes from a number of artists of the remixes initially done on that release.At times the interpretations are miles from Miles Davis, but it must be kept in mind that the emphasis here is DJ remixes in the universe of clubland. Laswell churns out the most intriguing selection with the 16:42 of On The Corner (Subterranean Channel Mix), while the brilliant Davis trumpet line drives In A Silent Way (DJ Cam remix).There is a fun energy involved in the project and expands on the oftentimes flat work initially done by Laswell."
1,some sorry sh*t,"I'm absolutely astounded. OK, the one listenable track is Bill Laswell's mix of the 'Helen Butte' from On the Corner. The outstanding insult of the set is DJ Cam's both unintentionally hilarious and tragic remix of the gorgeous 'In a Silent Way,' which is now reworked with a lame-ass hip-hop thing dominating and what sounds like a dog barking or whatever. Gag. It's a friggin' shame, really is. avoid Doc scott's 'remix' of 'Rated X' which is such a boneheaded ego trip just as is the rest of the album that I have to fight off the strong desire to regret spending even a cent or a second on this steaming turd of an album."
5,Mind-Blowing,"Simply put; for those who seek the Gil Even's, Vintage quartet/quintet sounds; Don't buy this. For those who want to appreciate VERY TALENTED producers and DJ's remixing some amazing Miles beats, sounds and hooks into something wonderfully funky. BUY THIS!!"
3,"Trust Me, Some Of The Songs Are Megaton Bombs...","E-Roc is an okay emcee, but Play Dough (Ill Harmonics) totally saves this album. Play Dough may be just a ""middle-class white boy"" as he calls himself, but he's pretty dope. Hmm, bad things about this album: Some bad hooks, some annoying E-Roc flows, and all of the interludes. I did find ""R&B-Boy Cipher"" rather amusing though. E-Roc should've branched that idea out a little instead of using only phone calls for interludes. The best thing about this album is Play Dough (and Vex's verse on ""Ear To The Track""). Unfortunately, E-Roc can get unnerving sometimes with his Praswell-like flows. Let's see... the best tracks: ""Ear To The Track,"" ""Ill Radiation,"" and ""Rockstars."" ""Rockstars"" has a wicked guitar riff and the bassline is nice as well. I'd say that you shouldn't get the cd. Get the cassette (if you can even find it)."
3,worth addin to your collection,"this album has some unbelievable tracks, but some not so nice tracks as well. the good tracks make this album worth it. play dough makes a great appearance. the lyrics show a possotive knowledge of the LORD and make you wanna sing along. e-roc has a smooth and unique style. a good addition to any collection."
3,"Useable, but quaity control needed","Encouraged by the performance of a set of Corelle plates purchased earlier from Amazon, I ordered a set of the 28-Ounce Navy Blue trimmed bowls. When they arrived, they seemed satisfactory, but on the first rinse and wash, I noticed that on the outer surface, around the base are small sandgrain-like imperfections of the surface that feel all the world like baked-on food. On close inspection they are bits of ceramic glazing. On every wash they attract unwanted attention and cause extra scrubbing. It is a minor annoyance, but a chronic one. The inside surface of the bowls are smooth and without flaw, thankfully.A less tolerant person might have returned the set for replacement or refund. Each bowl suffers this distracting defect. Bear this in mind as you consider this purchase."
1,Good bowl - horrible price,"This price is ridiculous, you can get it at almost any other place for much less. For shame!!! Get it at Walmart or Macy's."
1,Not As Advertised,"My rug arrived without any tags, so I did not know what name brand the rug is. When I contacted the seller, he claimed to sell only Bowron rugs. However, when I asked him to send me a tag, the tag said it is Shear Style. The rug is not a Bowron Gold Star rug."
4,NPR introduced me to Dot,"What a find! Listening and jogging to NPR radio in So Cal when Colour Me hit the airwaves. I was not a Dot Allison follower, but will be from now on. I loved the song and bought the album as soon as it was released. I have not regretted it and am pleased to say that the blind risk was well worth it.It is enchanting, fresh and emotional. This has been a wonderful baptism into this style of music. Will be investigating similar titles without delay.I don't even know what she looks like!"
4,"A come down, not a let down","On this, her `difficult' second album, Dot proves that there is life after cult status. This may lack the lushness of One Dove, but makes up for it by creating a dreamy atmosphere reminiscent of Bjoerk's Venus as a Boy. In short, she's much more than just a pretty face."
3,"Wanted to like it, ended up dizzy","I have very fond memories of the One Dove record, and maybe some day I'll feel the same way about this, but... It's not that the record is bad. It's well made in a way, but for me, it's one of those that can only fit a very specific mood, and it's not a mood I'm in that often. There's an overall woozy vibe to the tracks that isn't really chill or relaxing. It actually leaves me a little physically unsettled. Maybe I shouldn't listen with headphones. Anyway, as a pop experiment, I give this 4 stars, but as a pleasurable aural experience, I give it 3. Like it matters."
3,dull.,"picked up this cd used at the local music emporium, and i've given it a couple of spins. it's honestly good, decent trip-pop, but that sort of stuff doesn't really float my boat unless there something unique or particularly endearing about it. i'm afraid ms. allison reminds me of my saccharine yet extremely insensitive ex-girlfriend. gah. maybe i'm just cyncial; do not write it off--if you're into this kind of music, you should certainly pick it up and judge for yourself."
5,True Music,"This is what you call true music, well in my opinion anyway. If you're like me, and I simply love music like this, (almost any soft female vocalists), if you are into this, I would recommend it. This is very nice, well thought out, sympathic, and it fills my heart with joy just listening to it."
3,afterglow. dot allison,Some pretty good songs. very tranquil. must aquire a taste for this kind of music.
4,familiarity breeds contempt,"This album is like that person you meet and fall in love with instantly. You can't get enough of them, you spend all your time with together, and then, suddenly, you realize that you are hearing the same things over and over, and most of them are cliche. Once the initial blush is off the rose, you are not so enchanted with this ""soulmate"". Ok, maybe i'm a bit bitter.This album grabbed me at first and I was riveted by track 1 and track 3 in particular. It went into heavy rotation in my cd player. Then in about 2 weeks I was suddenly completely sick of Afterblow and now I don't play it at all. Too bad, i think this band has potential and I like Dot's voice but she needs to work on a more sophisticated message and sound. Something with a little more substance that will hold up over time."

4,A Real Solid Efford,"Beautifully seductive and intimately distant soulful melodies, with a variey of instruments intelligently applied."
2,Boring!,"I was so displeased with this CD. I don't like Dot's breathy, barely-there vocals & the only song that caught my attention was ""I Wanna Feel the Chill"", & that was only because of the Tim Buckley sample used, which pretty much made the song. The beats on this CD are otherwise way lame & you would be better off listening to Portishead or Bjork even than this crappy CD."
3,Still waiting for WIDESCREEN version,"Comon' Warner Home Video. Get out of the 1980s mentality of producing video products for VHS players and 19"" TVs and get into the age of DVD and large TVs. There is a huge queue of your customer's who are waiting to buy this movie in its original unmodified format.Incidently, Warner Home Video also released the classic ""Arthur"" in full screen format only."
3,Disappointed....,I was looking for 2 discs in the collection like the advertising stated. This is a one disc set with a movie on each side. No widescreen format available.
3,Good but not great funny movies,"Two fun movies with a couple of over-the-hill but still funny classic comediens. Ann Margret is great as the live live to the fullest new neighbor, and Burgess Meredith has a very funny small role as the over-sexed father of Jack Lemmon's character. Sophia Loren is classic as the sexy new arrival, and good showings by Darryl Hannah and others you will recognize. Nothing new or great here, but fun movies for a Saturday night in."
5,Great Reference,"Very good short descriptions with genus and species listed. Thorough and informative. It is helpful for the novice and experienced gardener alike. Plant pictures are not photographs, but are realistic graphic depictions. Textural descriptions are very good in identification. I recommend this to all gardeners in my retail setting."
4,Very satisfied with the purchase,Since this was the used book I thought it would be in a bad state. But to my surprise the book was in a very good condition as stated in the original listing.
2,"Too small, among other things","Thought these were a really unusual and gorgeous way of keeping things from being set directly on my glass coffee table. Wrong! Here are my issues with them:1) They do not absorb liquid, so if something wet is placed on them the liquid is going to simply roll off the agate and onto the coffee table. Example: a typical cup from a fast food joint when the ice melts and condenses on the outside of the cup. That made its way to my coffee table pretty quick.2) They are too small. I wouldn't put anything bigger on them than a shot glass or a wine glass. Yes, they can handle a pint glass (or equivalent) but that's cutting it pretty close.3) No rubber feet at the bottom to protect a glass coffee table, which I assume many people have. Basically you're putting an item with a glassy surface directly on glass. No good! That is asking for scratches.Oh well. Nice idea but poorly executed."
1,Does not catch police radar ever!!!,"I bought this radar for a gift for overseas. It was supposed to catch all kinds of signals. After driving for about 200 miles and passed by 3 police cars on the highway and that thing didn't make even one sound, I pulled over in front of an officer from state police and asked him to use the radar to test it. Guess what? Not a sound!!! I ended up returning the product, the company wouldn't refund shipping charges even for defective items, and they still charged me 10% restocking fee. I will never buy from that company ever, neither will buy this brand of radar again."
3,good produt some what,the product did not come with suction cups for the window works well helps out alot
3,ok radar detector,This product works ok. Seems to pick everything up and what I mean is it goes off every other minute. I feel it's bulky in size and looks like it would be an older model.
1,bad product,"I can not give a good review of this product because the one I purchased does not work. I am now going to have to send it into the manufacturer for service. (I waited to long to call or I would have sent it back for a refund.) the only alerts that I have gotten are on the ku band, none of the other bands have ever alerted. the manufacturer had me reset the detector. But I don't expect that is going to fix it so now I will have to send it in for service. wish I had not waited past 30 days to call!"
1,Not worth even the small price,The thermometer works well enough but the humidistat is totally off. Measures a constant 75 regardless of what my other instruments or humidifier measure (usually around 40). Don't waste your money on this one.
4,Working fine,"Based on these reviews, my hydrometer must be an anomaly. The humidity accuracy of my device has been +/- 5% just as the manual states. The humidity reading does react slowly but it definitely changes. The temperature is accurate also. I placed my hygrometer outside on the front porch in a shady and sheltered location if that helps anyone. I gave it four stars because it's cheap and it works."
1,DEFECTIVE,"Hygrometer works, Temp is constantly at 78 degrees even when its well over 85. complete junk.I sent an email to TIMEX about this product and the poor quality. They wrote back that they just license the Timex name to another company. I noticed on the back of the device it says ""Maverick Industries, Inc."". I assume that this is the real manufacturer. You can see their site for the product here: [...]If you have problems, contact Maverick here: [...]"
1,not a useful hygrometer,this product is not useful as a hygrometer - it does not seem to move with humidity change
1,China is makeing garbage like Japan did in the 80's and 90's,"Hygrometer at 75% and holding in all types of conditions? The US has no Quality control over products coming in from other countries. Foreign products from tools to autos are starting to disappoint. If we limit ourselves to only foreign companies for products while Wall Street turns the US into a ""service economy"" well, we will just have to worry about the quality of hamburger we sell one another."
4,Good device... quite slow sometimes.,This device reads the humidity well. But often it takes a long time to reflect the accurate reading. It's good to have it...
1,Hygrometer doesn't work,"I've had this unit for two months and the hygrometer is still on 75% relative humidity. The ironic thing is, if you look at the picture at the top of the page that unit is also on 75% relative humidity.Update 8-29-2011:I see this item is finally listed as unavailable... thank goodness.I recently bought this:Acu Rite Indoor Humidity Monitorand this one works great."
1,Not reliable at all,We bougth 3 sku and all of them show a different reading. No way to know what is the real humidity.
1,Hygrometer portion does not work at all,"The hygrometer portion of this device does not work at all. The needle moves slightly in response to humidity, it maybe has a 10% range total and is calibrated completely incorrectly."
2,Too big,Item doesnt fit the grill I ordered it for will have to be cut down and fitted to it thus damaging the ceramic coating Local walmart cheapy is working fine
3,Amost too short,"Each end of the heat plate has a tab with a hole for mounting with a screw into the housing on the grill. I think the chinese measured wrong as only one hole would line up with the grill body. It was only off 1/4"" but I was able to rig-it. I am finding that if there is something wrong it probably was made in China.Music City Metals 94631 Porcelain Steel Heat Plate Replacement for Select Gas Grill Models by Charbroil, Kenmore and Others"
5,Excellent Product!,"I'm VERY happy with this armband / belt clip / skin for this player. The skin is easy to put on and get off, is well made, and obviously a perfect fit. I'm not about to test it, but I imagine the skin would do a decent job of protecting the unit if one should drop it. It also protects the unit from scratches and dings. I do, however, wish the skin came with a screen protector of some sort.The belt clip is very secure. Fantastic.The armband is an armband. Not much to say there, but the beltclip attaches to the armband, making it easy to take the player on and off of it (in case you go from cardio to weights or whatever and want to switch). I do agree with the reviewer who said that someone with exceptionally large arms may have a problem fitting into this. I'm a pretty big guy and this is not a problem for me.I'm a runner and truly love this armband."
3,"OK, but a bit small","As other reviewers have noted out here, it's a little on the small side for men - I'm not exactly packing steel anacondas in my sleeves but this was just too small to be comfortable for working out at the gym. The little cord management clip (magnetic) was nice and the ruber sleeve it fit into works ok (I just clip it to the pocket of my T-shirt and it stays put well enough). If the band were about 4 or 6 inches longer I think this would work for a lot more people out there. Can't understand why they made the thing so short - can't have saved that much on the cost of goods I wouldn't think..."
3,"Product nice, BUT!","The arm band was not big enough...i have 17 inch biceps, and it does not even come close to fitting...the belt clip is nice though and the skin is nice, but if you want it for the band, hope you have small arms"
2,It is a bit small,"The quality of the band is very nice. The band is too small though. It does not fit all the way around my arm. I bought mainly for the belt clip, so I do not feel the purchase was a complete loss."
3,"Have, and am looking elsewhere","I'm rather surprised at all the glowing reviews for this set, because the set itself doesn't glow, except with polish. One reviewer calls it ""tender,"" which I can see, sort of, but really it's all too elegant and well mannered and unexciting. In fact, I'm currently on line looking for some recordings with which to replace it."
4,No batteries required for 3D Wood Tic Tac Toe,"Think of three Tic-Tac-Toe boards stacted one on top of another using wood x's and wood sphere's for O's.It's a good way to expand strategy skills from the 8 possible ways to win a Tic-Tac-Toe on paper to 76 possible combinations in 3-D. First exposure with this game at Camp Fiesta Island, San Diego this summer at an BSA Order of Arrow meeting after a day of swimming, sailing and kayaking. It's become a great breakfast table warm-up activity for the day with the family."
5,Awesome Combo of Artists!,"This CD is awesome!!! I love the mix of artists, and the songs are all diferent, they dont all sound alike. The only thing I didnt like about this CD is all of the sweeps in it, every other song was a small minute sweep."
2,Very narrow presentation,"The author cannot be faulted for research, but the presentation is focussed entirely on such ""male oppression"" as nuns endured. Anyone looking for compelling spirituality, a full look at the incredible achievements of religious in any century, or even recognition of the fact that the professional and educational achievements of religious Sisters far exceeded that which other women could begin to hope for in recent centuries will be disappointed.It is unbalanced, rather dismal, and not likely to appeal to anyone unless her philosophy of religious life is entirely one of a fight between the sexes."
3,Okay for beats,I bought it for the extra cut 'Watch Out' because I thought it was hot and was hoping that more of the same beats/kinda tunes would be on there but it wasn't. It's definitely good but not what I was looking for exactly...
3,Loads of information.,"This book is big. Much credit to the author for a well researched topic. No doubt English knows his subject matter. However, for a reader not looking for a degree in the Irish Mob, this can be overwhelming. There are countless characters and each with their own, often dull, histories. Due to the exstensive history of the Irish Mob, the author is unable to spend lots of time on any one charater, and jumps characters often. Between all the, 'mad dogs,' and 'luckies' it is very hard to know one from the other, and who did what, and disliked who. This book is not a page turner, but in all fairness if you are looking to really educate yourself on the topic, you almost have to read this. If your just looking for a real life mob thriller, this is not it!"
2,Not that great,I just did'nt think it was really that great of a book. The pictures were okay but I thought the book itself was ill informed and poorly written... I gave it 2 out of 5 stars.
4,Paddy Wacked,"My great-great uncle was an Irish immigrant, Civil War veteran & an 'Irish' mayor - a contemporary of 'Honey Fitz' Fitzgerald. Very proud, dignified, well-dressed, and profoundly interested in everything & everyone. On the 'take' - for sure. But they spread the wealth around and truly cared about people. The vote got us the power, the politics, the jobs and then up the ladder. It's astonishing to realize that once upon a time, a Catholic couldn't get elected to anything nationally. Now, I think 7/12 Supreme Court justices are Catholic & every politician wants the 'Catholic' vote & a president went to a Pope's funeral. Go figure.I enjoyed the book - but I'm glad the Irish gangs are gone. Hopefully, Whitey Bulger will stay in jail (he has a way of slithering out of things.) The Irish were pushed out by the Italians, who are now being pushed out by the Mexican and/or Russian gangs. There's always a bigger bully around the corner."
5,The best book ever written about Irish mobsters,"This book is an encyclopedia of the Irish mobster, going all the way back to John ""Smoke"" Morrissey in the 1850's and ending with Frank Sheeran in 2003. Irish mobsters in numerous cities are covered including those in New York, New Orleans, Chicago and Cleveland.Very well-written and a must read for all mob fans.Highly recommended."
4,Jones New York dress,"This is a beautiful silk dress, perfect for spring and summer months. I have received many compliments on its unique design."
1,Not As It Appeared,"The dress was much different looking when it arrived - the design was deceiving in the picture - much bolder - I took one look and didn't like it - unfortunately, I had to pay to return it which is why i hesitate to online purchase"
4,Okay.,"Looks better in the photo, but not a bad dress. Small could be slightly smaller and more fitted."
3,"Okay, but not a great fit.","I couldn't find simple wiper refills in the store (without the entire blade). So this was great. However, I had to remove the little metal clip on the refill and it doesn't quite fit perfectly in the blade, which is Anco U-18R blade purchased a year ago. So unless I missed something crucial, it is okay, but not great and might wear out/stretch out quickly as it is a little loose in the blade."
3,Community college-type effort with a really good actor,"What's the opposite of a budget? Oh right, a deficit. This film looks like it was made with a deficit, not a budget. But hey, you've got to get your start somewhere, right? Not a bad effort then, for a first effort.The production quality is unratable, but the peformance of Carol DeSalles warrants notice. With apparently no direction, she created a three dimensional character I could actually believe in. I'd like to see her in a real film."
4,Come Along,"I heard ""Come Along"" on the radio, and Titiyo's voice blew me away. Watch out! Here comes another singer of Macy Gray's calibre."
5,Laughter and good food is wonderful for the soul,The Sterns are delightful and I enjoyed their story immensely. Makes me want to take off on the road myself (with husband along of course) and experience some of the food and adventures they had. Will share this book with friends.
5,An Excellent Book,"Except your credits are bit off.All of the editors you've listed are actually artists who contributed the art, comics and articles to the book.The editors of Expo 2000 were Tom Devlin, Chris Oarr, Christian Panas, Jeff Alexander, Karon Flage, Greg McElhatton and Charles Brownstein.The book is an annual anthology produced by the Expo/SPX in conjunction with the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund as a fund raiser for the CBLDF. Oni Press is not the publisher.You did get the ISBN number right."
4,Excellent comic collection,"A very nice collection of american indie comic_book artists. Some of them are boring, most of them are nice, and there are quite a few gems hidden in those pages.Watch out for the prices! They might vary from 3 to 300 dollars!"
4,fish turner,"This turner works well for fish, chops, cookies, cake slices, & pies. I'm sure there are more uses too but so far I have only used it for these things.I would recommend buying it. Very useful tool."
2,more than graham coxtom missing here,"this is the second time blur has recorded an album without having a set of completed songs to work on. the sound effects, tricks, and gimmicks can't hide that damon has at least temporarily lost his muse. he is reaching out for other textures in an attempt to make up for it, but it isn't really fooling that many people. coxton's harder edged musicality is sorely missed. they shold hire jonny marr or someone of similar clout to give them a new voice and a new focus. alex and dave are obviously just enjoying the relatively easy ride of being in blur these days. there is no real musical tension on this record which is why it never really goes anywhere. I love blur and i have seen them live in nyc, philly, seatle (on this new tour) and winston salem. i have preached the gospel of blur to anyone who would listen. let me implore to damon---------take your risks, but never forget how to write a good song. that is your greatest gift."
2,"Okay, upon a listen of 13, I take back my initial 3 stars...","Originally 3 stars, I have now, in a moment of musical sanity, demoted this ablum to 2 stars. This is due to the listening of Blur's album ""13"". I just couldn't take this new one again, so I pulled 13 from my cd collection and realized - again - what a gem it is. Deep, textured, progressive. Everything Think Tank isn't. I'd of rather waited years longer to hear something worthy of Blur, even without Coxon. Granted...Granted, Alex James bass on Think Tank has never been better. I'll give em that. But nothing more.Instead of buying this album, if you don't own a Blur album, purchase 13. Caramel and Trim Trab are two of the better rock songs recorded in the last decade. They stand strong and able next to anything Radiohead has done.With the departure of Graham Coxon - and I hate to say it - Blur should've broken up. This album is testament to why."
1,Worst Blur album ever,"Oh the humanity. Don't trust the Amazon review-""We've got a file on you"" is brilliant? Sure, if Tenacious D's ""One Note Song"" is brilliant, too. There is exactly one good song on this album, ""Out of Time,"" and there are about 2 or 3 listenable ones, such as ""Ambulance"" and ""Sweet Song,"" but that's about it. The rest is trashy filler that goes pretty much nowhere. ""Crazy Beat"" is stupid and annoying, ditto ""Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club"" and pretty much everything else. Not that I don't like change and evolution with bands, but this is regression, not evolution."
4,A Gorillaz Fan,"I came to this recording via Gorillaz and I'm glad I did. I have tried to give Blur a trial listening a few times in the past but always walked away scratching my head wondering what all the hype was about. Thier music always sounded so pop-ish and superficial.But after Demon Days I was forced to give Blur another try, this time with Think Tank. There is hardly a bad track on ithis record; the hooks are cleverly layered yet deceptively simple and the production is as good as it gets.A nice transition for Gorillaz people, me thinks."
4,Limited Edition????,"I enjoyed the album as a whole. However, the packaging says the album has 4 extra tracks on the limited edition, yet I haven't been able to access any of these. No one else has commented on this, and I am a bit confused why."
3,Strange,This new cd by Blur I must say is their strangest disc yet. Sounds like out of space music with some interesting rips. If you like far out bizarre music its for you. But I must add some of the songs do remind me of their older material. I gave it three stars because its so different..I like different so I don't know if it deserves a fourth star or not...but its definately strange too....
2,Disappointing,"Misleadingly, the first couple of tracks may lull you into a false sense of security as the atmospheric ""Ambulance,"" the pleasing ""Out of Time"" and the raucous ""Crazy Beat,"" whilst never touching the stature of classic Britpop at least maintains an air of freewheeling brilliance.However, after this short starburst, the rest of Think Tank meanders meaninglessly before dropping off badly into distracted, self-indulgent and mundane chaos.To think that I found Oasis' Heathen Chemistry a more rewarding and satisfying experience. How sad."
1,No Graham = No Go,"I am a Blur fan, have been for a long time. This album fell flat and just plain didn't grab me. Nothing catchy or hit-worthy as is the Blur cookbook. I can't help think that without Graham, the band is lost. (That copy protection thing means no play on my MP3 player either, no good!)"
1,"Great, if you can listen to it","This review is for the ""[Enhanced][Explicit Lyrics] version. I agree with sentiments that this is Blur's best album to date. But be warned that this is NOT an audio CD (as Amazon falsely labels it)- it's a ""copy-protected disc"", meaning that it fails to meet Philip's Red Book standards for CD's and won't play in higher-end CD players."
2,"BLUR IS EITHER ""OUT OF TIME"" OR DEAD","This proves that Graham Coxon was Blur creative core and Damon basically the mouthpiece. It also proves that Gorillaz drained Damon's energy, resulting in many of the droning beat-box dirges on this release. This highlights the band's comedown mode with plenty of druggy references, uninventive lyrics (oooh, ""Crazy Beat""), and a bizarre Arabic backdrop not cleverly targeted to the post-9/11 listener. If Damon thinks he's now some world-music guru like Peter Gabriel having been to Mali and Morocco he's mistaken. I propose getting Damon and Justine back together, as this one makes ""13"" seem like a party record. Unlike all other Blur CDs (and I've got pretty much all of them) this one's heading to my shelf if not the used record bin."
2,Very Dissapointing,"I bought this album hoping for a continuation of the type of music to be found on their best-of CD. Instead, I ended up with a disjointed, boring collection of very similar sounding tracks. I think they could've tried harder."
4,Great starter album for Gorillaz fans.,"I happen to be a very big fan of Gorillaz,buying their new album,Demon Days off of Amazon.com,and I think that this is a great ""Starter Album"",to people who have never heard Blur(Although,you would have to be living in a cave,not to have heard Song 2),but are big fans of Damon Albarns side project,Gorillaz. The songs themself,arent as good as Demon Days,but,then again,what is?(I told you,im a BIG Gorillaz fan)Old Blur fans wouldnt enjoy this one as much,but Gorillaz fans will think that it (Excuse me for using stupid internet language) PWNS."
4,Another brilliant Blur Album.,"Bit optimistic about this one before purchasing it.Gee it sure shows you should listen to yourself and not what people say, this is another great album from, Blur.When you listen to it, you can tell Graham Coxon is not in the band. As the songs don't seem to have the same to sort of tone as many of their others not that it matters.""Ambulance"" ""Out of Time"" and ""Crazy Beat"" are the standouts, the rest take some time to grow on you.Another great album from Blur."
4,Weird but wonderful,"Like a lot of others, I didn't really like this when I first heard it but grew on me slowly until I loved it! I knew it wasn't going to be like Parklife, but this is nearly as brilliant and very different. For me, Caravan, Out of Time and On the Way to the Club are the highlights. But I think you have to listen to the whole album to get the most out of it."
3,Blurs the line between ok and very good,"One of those indie rock-pop light experimenter's that manages to back up enough woozy, hip posturing with catchy, diverse substance and effectively eccentric accentuation to deem acceptable, if not worthy."
4,Blur Phase Three,"After the dismal 13, Think Tank is a refreshing recording. The sound is a progression of Music Is My Radar. However, in order to keep the band together, it probably should have been Damon Albarn's solo album. It's understandable why the guitarist Graham Coxon abandon Blur while making this album. This music doesn't lend itself to his heavy guitar style. The success of Gorillaz also had something to do with his leaving. He didn't want the band to be known as Damon Albarn's Blur.[DW]"
4,mature,"they have really grown up since parklife, and although the depature of g. coxon is unfortunate, they can still make challenging, thoughtful music."
4,For the sensitive folks,"I think the slow songs in this album like good song, sweet song and out of time are much better than the upbeat song. I feel that the upbeat songs make blur look like theyre trying too hard to be young again. I think this is one of their best albums"
3,Think Tank,"Think Tank~ Blur is an ok recording of experimetal pop/rock/advantgarde music. The lyrics are way out there and the sound reminds of nothing I have heard so far. But if one asked me and I had to give an answer then it would be a bit like a mix between the cure, einsturzende and everyday pop. The book-let is a travesty and the cover looks like someone spent five minutes on a sketch and then in their infinite wisdom decided that was all the work that was needed. Not a good decision. Still do not get me wrong here. It is not a bad album at all. It is just a little odd and not in a really amazing way and therefore it gets 3 well deserved stars. Ok but nothing more."
4,Everybody's moving.,"There's something wrong with the album's consistency that's difficult to explain. Various song styles are represented, but never for a lenghty duration, resulting in an overall unevenness. Still, when it works, it's monumental, like when the bassline moves on the first track, or the isolating sound from 'On the way to the club.' It's a grooviness that harkens back to their first 'baggy' album. This may yet grow on me; having detested '13' when it was released, only to claim it as my favorite over a year later.Blur tend to operate beyond a measurable curve."
5,Blur is Back.. woohooo!,"What's going on here? All of a sudden there's plenty of good, deep music coming out. We probably won't hear any of it on the radio, but thank God the music exists. My favorite track at the moment is ""On The Way To The Club"", but there's plenty of textural echoey guitars and percolating synths on a lot of the songs, and they all cradle Damon's voice so nicely. Other cds I've gotten recently ...include Coldplay, Travis, Pat Ortman's The Wow Signal, Peter Gabriel's Up, and Billy Corgin's new band."
1,Graham-less Blur?,"Since the departure of Mr Coxon, Blur has lost a lotof their edge and focus. The last song, which doesfeature Coxon, is the lone bright spot in thismusical sea in search of a boat. Blur as a band isdead, pity. Check out older Blur titles before this.Crazy Beat featuring Damon's rudimentary guitar isa joke, as is most of the CD. Buyer beware.1 star for ""Battery in My Leg"" O stars forthe rest"
2,Boring Electronica that Wastes Your Time,"What a blur of pointless crap. This may be The most boring, pointless album i've ever heard. Cool? Greatness? oh,no, no, no... i don't think so. If anyone considers this Greatness i gotta ask what are you smokin buddy. NOt to bash anyone's favorite band, but this is a waste of time. I can only thank God that it isn't longer. This albums follows alot of what blur does, so it seems they just keep repeating past album. Here's tha band's meeting before they begin an album: ""Let's go in the studio, get some drugs, and become so strung out that the album sounds like we feel. Then when we feel good we'll make one punk song, and end the album's sessions.""Crap."
5,Kings of Love Songs,"Graham and Russell has that special magic together as Air Supply. When you are listening to these songs, especially ""Even The Nights Are Better"" and ""Making Love Out of Nothing At All"", you can feel the emotions as you listen. If you want to tell that special someone how you feel, pick up a copy of this cd and the rest will take care of itself."
2,VERY AVERAGE MUSIC,WIth The Exception of Every Woman in the World I just don't get The Hype Behind Air Supply?All The Songs are Real Mushy.Basic Arrangements&Production.The Vocals were Alright from time to time but Overall I Just Can't Get into this Group at all.
1,"Air Supply? I'd prefer to suffocate, thank you...","Here you will find the altogether cloying cotton candy for the ears this group is noted for (if only they'd enclosed some COTTON for the ears to stuff the auricular canals whilst playing this wretched disc). Yup, how could I forget 'Lost In Love', a jukebox staple at the pizza joint I worked at back in the day. A memorable slice (sans pepperoni) in the annals of classic rock, right up there with such fave raves as Christopher Cross, Pablo Cruise, Toto, Michael Bolton, the Little River Band, the list of Grammy-winning genius acts we all so fondly remember...And now served up for our listening pleasure in all its digitally remastered glory...Well, it doesn't get MUCH MORE PEWTRIDDER than this, though I still prefer A Flock of Seaweed cos' they had better haircuts..."
5,Lost Treasure From The 70s!!,"For anyone who still doesn't know,Three's Company was modeled on this wonderful British comedy from the early 70s.My local Canadian station carried this every Friday night for a time and I never missed it.I thought it was lost in the mist of time but now thanks to Amazon I have it to watch and enjoy all over again!And it's still as funny as the first time around.The show made stars of it's 3 principal characters in England,although only the beautiful and talented Paula Wilcox really stayed in the public eye up to today.Watch and enjoy and see how much Three's Company really took from this show.Richard O'Sullivan really was the British John Ritter,which is really saying something!!"
3,history through architecture?,"I enjoyed reading most of this book but found myself skimming quite a few paragraphs. The author obviously has a soft spot for architecture but just leaned too heavily on this aspect of London. Perhaps in a book with photos it would have gone over better.The sections that told of London thru stories and events were really very well done and easily held my attention without being conscious of it. I just had to force myself thru the many parts that delved on one building or another. If I were in London I'd certainly take it along as a guidebook but just turning the page from home it doesn't work as well. Interesting? Yes. Knowledgeable? Yes. Just, perhaps, a bit dry."
2,Rambling and Idiosyncratic,The author brings his biases to bear on a summary history of London. It doesn't work. Much overlap with the cultural history of England. Random facts treated extensively. Detailed neighborhood and location emphasis without a larger purpose. Various literary references. Too much architectural detail. Limited sense of what London truly is.
3,jesi's thoughts,"Who could even THINK of not eating, let alone NOT eat. And it's NOT Madison. It's Aimee! I mean if she wants to be like Nikki she should take singing lessons, not starve herself! If I was Madison or Fiona I would be sooooooooooo freaked out right now. Can you even imagine it? I mean, when Madison so Nikki for the first time in person she didn't like her. So what was the point of getting Aimee so sick? It's just part of the ironic circle of life!"
4,Made Men,"Straight from the Bean- Ray Benzino, Mr. Gzus and Antonio 2G hold it down again. This CD is a must buy for all the soldiers and sistas from the streets. The production from the Hangmen 3 also will open heads. Ray and 2G has been holding it down from the RSO days and continue to spark the tight flows with Gzus. FOREVER RSO to Classic Limited Edition these cats are REAL! No studio g's knowwhatImean? Don't sleep on the Bean."
5,This is awesome!,"i thought this cd was awesome if you like wu-tang forever you'd like this cause it's kinda like it. made men deserve to be hyped unlike most of this d*ke rapper like noreaga, nas , mobb deep and all those other people. go buy this it's one of the best of the year. and i even liked it and i'm mostly a west & dirty south rap fan and occasionally like a few east people like redman, jay z, big pun, ruff ryders, wu-everyone, and flipmode. go buy this it's truly an awesome cd!!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!,My goodness! This is the worst hip hop album I ever heard in my life! To say that this album is anything other than the worst album EVER is overrating it!
5,BANGIN!!!!!,yo this cd is off the bangers its one of the hottest cd's. it gets steady rotation in my player aight peace out...
2,its ok one of benzino's side projects,this album i found in someone's cd case my friend found and he gave it to me. then i found this i popped it in and i wasn't surpised because it came out in the bad boy era 1998 and i wasn't really feelin this cd but the only songs that i really liked was Wise Guys For Life and Tommy's Theme from the belly soundtrack featuring LOX
1,Where's the thongs,"Sadly, this is only a DVD. I'll have to look elsewhere to find the thongs that Mar shills on his website."
1,Laughably bad,"I guess Amazon makes their money by selling everything they can, but they're doing themselves no favours by listing this.To call it amateurish would be an insult to amateurs the world over."
5,perhaps the most reverent album by Crystal Lewis,"for her second hymns project, Crystal decides to take on new sounds and musical genres without deviating from the traditional, but rather enhancing it.there is something in the songs that conveys humility and reverence on Lewis' part. she sets aside her ""vocal acrobatics"" and soaring style usually found on any of her albums and only seeks to serve the songs.this is my favorite Crystal Lewis album so far.favorites: his eye is on the sparrow, great is thy faithfulness, there is a fountain, when the roll is called up yonder, and were you there"
1,I expected more.,"I absolutely love Crystal Lewis...I have almost all of her albums...including the work that she did with Kirk Franklin. She is one of my favorite artists...across the board. She has a very unique voice. Her love for the Lord and for singing comes through.I do not know what happened...but something was missing from this album. Also, I love the old standards. For some reason, the elments did not come together...harmoniously.I hope that she will try again...and rethink what she did with this album. Sometimes, a great standard can be ruined by ""over-doing"" it. At other times; A modern twist...with the right artist or team...can introduce people to music - they otherwise never would have listened to."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","I read an interview where Crystal Lewis said she recorded this album in her bedroom. Well, you know what? It sounds like it. This is by far the worst album I've ever heard of hers. Hymns, My Life, is much better by far on so many levels. She actually had a live band and background singers in her songs. This CD is just a synth-mess. Sorry, Crystal. I had to tell the truth."
5,Very accurate,"Although this movie is not the glossy, high-tech production most of us are used to it is a very good story. It portrays a modern witch in a very realistic way and would be a good educational film to those who do not understand the nature of Wicca."
3,"""Wicca"" in Action","Lots of ""witch"" movies hit the screens that misrepresent modern-day practitioners of the Craft. Although this movie was filmed on a low budget, it does a much better job of portraying how witches approach the world. It does an interesting job of intermingling chaos theory, martial arts, and neo-paganism.Some of the acting is stilted, the lines awkward. Its David vs. Goliath plot has been done before. Nevertheless, the creative amalgamation of Wicca, aikido, and chaos theory works well. If you don't really care about neo-paganism, this movie will may not hold your attention. As a Wiccan priest, I found it well worth it.The acting was worthy of community theatre, the script had innovative ideas, but didn't quite pull everything together. Averages out to three stars although my wife said I'm overly generous.(If you'd like to comment about this review, click on the ""about me"" link above to send me email. Thanks!)"

1,Someone has to say it ...,"There are some movies that are so bad you pull them out after fifteen or twenty minutes. Then there are a few that reach such a plateau of awfulness you have to keep watching just to see how bad it can get. This movie is in the later category. I can't believe anyone would give this movie five stars, no matter how much they appreciate the sentiment...Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible film. If this is a ""true"" depiction of the craft, I now know why I've never joined Wicca. I would have become a ""bad"" witch within a week and ripped the silly hearts out of the rest of the coven :-)"
5,A Powerful and Entertaining Window into American Culture,"Dixie Chicks' singer Natalie Maines' notorious cut at the president is amedia story that just won't leave us, will it? However, mainstream mediahas only scratched the surface of what it means to the American public.Don't expect to find the same redundant Fox News and CNN sound bites andslogans in this film. Instead, you'll want to brace yourself for sometruly unique American discourse within this odyssey into the dark side ofpatriotism. It's heavy metal parking lot meets the sophistication of ErrolMorris or Spike Lee. This film is a historical time capsule and I watchedit as if I had my eyes pressed against a fishbowl of quirky Americanculture. I'm not particularly a Dixie Chicks music fan; I love this filmfor the sociopolitical issues and its stark moments of human nature,though I can see how this profound and ongoing dialog is stronglyappealing to Dixie Chicks fans and anti-fans alike."
3,NOT THAT EASY,"My nine-year old loved the wayside school books, but this book is a bit tougher - wacky math. However, since she already loves the author' s style, she was willing to give it a try. Wished the book were funnier."
1,Thought this would be like the other Wayside School Books,"My son didn't like this book because it wasn't actually a reading book, it's just math problems. It takes a special kid to enjoy doing math problems in their spare time."
4,design essential,I return to this book over and over as a reference for the design of play environments.
5,Great little cart,"We recently purchased a wheelchair conversion mini-van to carry my wife in her power wheelchair. We are planning a 1000 mile trip over three days and taking a lot of stuff with us. I bought this cart so that I could load it with boxes and then wheel it up the ramp after her wheelchair was loaded. Then be able to quickly unload the van at each stop. The well made cart works better than I had anticipated, I ordered a second one as both will fit(no middle seats in our wheelchair conversion van). I highly recommend this cart to anyone who wants to move cargo/luggage over a distance or quickly."
4,Perfect for my immediate need.,"I needed some sort of lightweight cart in a hurry and figured Amazon would probably have it. This one fit the bill nicely. It's inexpensive and light and it rolls. Simple to assemble, folds up quickly, easy to toss into the trunk of the car. Only small complaint might be with the spring loaded bar that traverses the width of the platform and serves to lock the handle in an upright position. While it is convenient to use and makes folding the cart up a breeze, it does limit somewhat the length of items you can place on the cart."
1,ZERO STARS! ZERO!,"This boy-band tries hard to sing well, but they fall flat on their faces. They can't sing! ORLANDO, STOP MAKING MORE BOY-BANDS CAUSE ALL OF THEM HAVE ""NO TALENT"" WRITTEN ALL OVER THEM!"
1,Not the JMT I know and love,"Make sure you listen to Cave of the Heart before you buy it. I have listened to and loved JMT for years, so I ordered this CD before release based on what was said about it in his newsletter. Imagine my chagrin when, instead of the beautiful, spiritual music I had expected, I found all this rock 'n roll (saxaphones!) and according to the liner notes ""just having a good time with friends."" It sounds like not very good Crosby, Stills, and Nash, especially with that B3 organ. ""Devotion"" and ""Walk and Follow Jesus"" are the only classic JMT on this one. Listen before you buy!"
1,poor design,"I bought one for our club. It didn't last long enough to fill one recycle can worth of aluminum. The crushing plate would bend back because the metal rod was too short to support it. It would also ""jump track"" and jamb. I ordered a replacement but once I looked at it I knew my problems would return so I just asked for my money back.Great idea, poor implementation."
2,screws loose,"works well although it dose not attach easily to just any 32gal can, the instuctions are non existent and the screws come loose easily and are quick to lose in a pile of cans"
3,Can crusher,Worked well but then it got twisted. Cannot find a replacement crusher. They should offer one for the lid.
4,Great Space Saver,"I love this item. It didn't fit the trash can perfectly, but I still use it every day. It is a real space saver. No more bags of cans waiting for recycle day."
1,Can Crusher gets crushed,This can crusher broke the first time I tried to use it. It took me 3 hours to try to fix it. The medal base is flimsy. Faster and easier to crush cans by stomping on them. Would not buy this again.
5,"Entertaining, delicious, and healthy!!","I loved this book! You don't even need to cook to enjoy it -- the stories and sidebars are a delightful read just by themselves. And if you do cook -- WOW! the recipes are different without being strange, with interesting twists on some standards, and some great new ideas, and all of them are healthy and yet sound utterly delicious. I've already done a dozen or so recipes, and every one was a huge hit. I have a lot of cookbooks, but this one instantly became one of my favorites. DOn't miss it!"
5,"The ""All"" Cookbook","I love learning that is joyfull and fun. That is what ""Hollywood Dish"" added to my life. I am learning new recipes that are awesome. I am learning amazing stories about Hollywood's history I never knew. I am learning how to make even better culinary choices that honor my love of food and my body. I am filed with new experiences to share with others. Now if that isn't great value, I don't know what is! No wonder Chef Akasha is a star. Her passion for food, culture and health illuminates every page of this fantastic book."
5,The World Needs More Stories Like This!,"Despite the unoriginal title, Crossroads is a unique story of a young man's struggles with life's paradoxes. It charmingly tells a story of his choices and his exposure to many orginal characters that develop and influence his decision making. The acting is genuine from a mixed cast of journeyman thespians and rising stars. Its a wholesome film that leaves the viewer satisfied. Its salubrious. The world needs more stories like this. Bravo!"
1,Forget it / time warp,"Do not buy this book. It is incredibly out of date. It also spends too much ink on the tourist traps that are already well known (e.g., 20 pages on Harvard Square, which is increasingly full of chain stores), and gives short shrift to the neighborhoods that are truly up and coming (e.g., one column on Central Square...which is also increasingly full of chain stores :-( ). A big disappointment, since I liked one of the earlier editions so much. I'm not sure what they updated for this edition; they highly recommended a bakery that's been shut down for over six years! Talk about information anxiety....I am a long-time Boston resident, and I bought this book to loan to my guests from out-of-town. Now i'm going to find a book that has actually been updated since the days before ""internet"". Is there a Rough Guide for Boston?"
4,Good for historical perspective,"This is a good guide for those interested in the history of various buildings and parts of town. Because stores open and close at times too quickly for any guide to keep up, there are some errors in that some places listed no longer exist but for those people who are looking for an easy reference to the buildings, I would recommend this book."
5,Awesome flying fun!,"This is an excellent kite to have hours of fun with at the beach or a park. At first it was a little difficult to control (the first 10 mins) after which it is sheer pleasure.Great colors and sturdy construction allows for this kite to crash hard and still survive.Definitely worth the money - but be careful flying it around people, it has the potential to move very fast at times."
3,stunt kite,"Leading edge has broken twice while flying, did not crash! I will say this they were very nice and have sent me new one both times. I just wonder how long they will hold up. It is a lot of fun"
2,"Good Product, poor experience","This has been a frustrating experience of sorts. When I received the kite, the casing is stained with dirt. Inside there is more surprises! The sail of the kite is stained with black dirt and color run markings. I really wonder if this is a new item! When I emailed Prism, there has been no response. The kite is a good quality kite and flys well, but this poor shopping experience has hindered my future purchase decision."
2,Not recommended for beginners. Spend your $100 elsewhere.,"First off, the kite came broken. I did my best to overlook that and figured it was just bad shipping. Either way it doesn't give Prism a good name.In short, this kite is not recommended for beginners.1. -It doesn't fly in well in light winds, (5mph or less)2. -The plastic connecting rods used on the leading edges where the wings fold for storage easily snap.I had just crashed the kite and was practicing the cartwheel launch where the kite starts nose down on the ground resting on one leading edge and you roll the kite into the launch position. I've done this maneuver many times with my $50 kite,so it caught me by surprise when the plastic connecting rod snapped in half.If you happen to know what you are doing, I could see how this could be a fun kite. When it did fly, it flew well. However, I really do not recommend this kite. Especially if you are new to flying. Or in my case, a kite to begin learning more advanced tricks."
5,Fun Fun Fun,"After moving to Boise I noticed that it gets pretty windy on a regular basis and I had often mentioned to my wife that it would be fun to fly one of those big kites in the strong winds we get here.This last Father's day she and the kids surprised me with the Prism Quantum Ice and I have to say it is really great fun.Setup and packing both take just two minutes each, which is much less than I expected. The brief instructions that come with the kite are more than enough to get you flying. The kite can be launched easily by the ""pilot"" without assistance and in really strong winds the ""pull"" is enough to move even a big adult like myself a step or two. The dual controls are very responsive and in short the Quantum is just a blast to fly."
2,Refried Hag,"These songs are classics... I mean great songs... but, don't waste your money on this collection: buy the originals. I love to hear Haggard sing his classics, and if this CD were recorded in concert I'd say buy it NOW, but it's not. It's represented here as 43 Classics, but these are not the classic hit recordings of these songs... they're all re-records made in 1995 (for I suppose the sake of making money that wasn't being made from the original records which were far superior to these). To put it in a nutshell, this collection is simply ""Re-fried Hag""."
3,Why Bother?,"If you're going to bother to re-record a song, shouldn't it be an improvement on the original? All of these songs are basically performed the same as the originals, with occasional stray horns or strings added which don't enhance the performance. The guest appearances are also unnecessary, the worst example being the inclusion of Jewel. There are plenty of compilations available with the original versions of these classics. Personally, I don't see the point of settling for this.(One side note; I hope Hag's been getting royalties on Elmo & Patsy's ""Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer"", a blatant ripoff of ""Daddy Frank""!)"
3,5 for the music 1 for the pakaging it scratches up the discs,"First off if your a country music fan you know how great all these songs are so this is not really a reveiw about the music, but the horribile packing that holds the discs the discs get more and more scratched each time they come out of the case and i have only had the set for a little over a week. This is stupid to package discs this way. If I were looking for merle music I would just buy a couple of single albums instead of this. That way the discs will last, I will probbally have to do that soon because of the excessive scratches that come from keeping the discs in the holder."
4,Fantastic Recordings,"No, these are not the original recordings. Still a must have for Hag fans. The duets with Jewel are truly gems."
2,Not Good...,I bought these at my local music store for $[...] bucks. Each reed honestly lasted about a week under normal playing conditions. Playing daily for about an hour a day. I only had one good reed from the box and i would not recommend these. You can get more for your moneys worth with a box of 5 vandoren.
5,Funny - but brush up on your British!,"Phwoar! I cracked up through most of this, and I learned quite a bit about the series. The authors are opinionated, to be sure, but that's not always bad. A new way of looking at the old obsession."
3,fun to read but many British expressions left me puzzled,"I really like the trivia and continuity sections for putting the episodes of the x-files in order in my head. I often skipped the Bottom Line section, because the authors lost me there. And I would dearly love to know the meaning and other uses of the expression ""phwoar!"""
3,Good book,"An interesting read, but it is written more as an autobiography than a research of Nazi experiments (I really couldn't care less about the court reporter's plane ride to Nuremburg - I needed facts for a college research paper)... But it was still an enlightening book."
1,Horrible Author,"The author of this book is a court reporter, which is a ridiculously bloated way of saying ""typist."" That is all court reporters do, they take dictation. Yet, Vivien Spitz fancies herself a novelist, and she wastes rodiculous amounts of space and time narrating stories about herself instead of sticking to the topic of the book. As the author, she contributes nothing, and one would be better off simply reading the actual transcripts of the trials.The factual information in the book is the only interesting content, but to get the facts, the reader has to muddle through incessant personal stories about the typist."
1,BORING,"This book is a very dry mix of court transcripts and clinical descriptions. It was a difficult and boring read of what should be a fascinating subject. I would prefer to read the STORY, not clincal and legal descriptions. I'm sure there must be good books that are captivating and easy to read on this subject but this is not one of them. This book was a waste of money and a huge disappointment. I will continue to look for a book that is better written and tells the story in a more flowing rather than clinical writing style."
3,Just kind of ok.,I have read a fair amount of Holocaust books and this one is down the middle of the road for information. It does however provide a unique point of view since it is from a woman who hadn't yet been appalled by the German atrocities.
3,perspective from a court reporter at the war crimes trials,"This book tended to be a bit slow for me. The best parts of it is the author's accounts of life in Germany after the war. The danger and the terrorism going on for years after. She also included portraits of the Germans on trial so you are able to see the faces of those who commited such atrocities. In some of the portraits, it's chilling. The best part for me because some of them looked like everyday normal people when in reality they were grotesque monsters."
3,Value of the book depends on your aim.,"The value of the book really depends on your aim. If you just wish to have a general factual survey about the Nazi human experiments raised in the Doctor's Trial, the book will serve your need. However, most of the book relating to the Doctor's Trial per se is same as the opening speech of the US Prosecutor (General Taylor) and it is definitely weak at the conversations between the defendants and the lawyers/prosecutors during the trial. As a result, you cannot explore from this book why the defendants can commit such crime (many of them are distinguishing doctors and even the chief prosecutor admitted that some of they were not sadists). In gist, it is a book about ""what"" but not about ""why"". If you want to explore the underlying mentality, the book ""Karl Brandt: The Nazi Doctor"" by Ulf Schmidt may serve as a good start."
3,it was okay,"took a little bit of focus to stay engrossed in the book, the stories were unreal...what humans can do to humans. sadl"
2,Disappointing,The book is essentially the author’s experiences in Germany after the war with the inclusion of transcripts of the trial. This makes for a very dull retelling of the facts.I would not recommend this book
1,Angel 1984 vhs it was broke,"sorry this one was broke, and the people that sent it, returned the money back to the card. they are nice people. they did the right thing. thank you"
2,Not worth it...,"I love the rest of the philosophy skin care line, but I can't say that my face has gotten anything but breakouts from this product. Stick to the purity cleanser, hope is not enough serum, hope in a jar and hope in a tube (the make-up optional package) and you will have great soft skin results."
3,very difficult to install,"In hindsight, these weren't worth the effort.I'm angry that the hinges in the instructions don't match what they gave me. The hinges don't adjust enough enough to help you square the doors. They also sag slightly which causes the door to rub."
3,"Nice Doors, Bad Size","These doors are made of the same soft wood as the closet organizer and the tower so care must be exercised during the installation. I bought two sets of doors so as to cover the front of the entire tower. The installation guide requires that a shelf be located at the bottom of the top doors. Logic would indicate that the same would hold true for the top of the bottom doors. I expected to see the doors meet jointly at a shelf with a small gap to prevent the doors from rubbing each other. The size of the doors prevent a configuration that will allow this. This is an engineering flaw that causes me to downgrade my rating to three stars. Otherwise, these are nice doors with glass panels."
1,Never received,"I will not order from this vendor in the future. I still have not received the merchandise and the vendor claims they do not have a tracking system, so who knows where this CD ended up."
4,South African Songs Get Royal Treatment,"In this album of Zulu, Xosa and other South African folksongs, Belafonte brings great empathy and tenderness to his renditions; though he is American, his linguistic and musical skills shine brightly and make the songs very accessible. Makeba, Queen of Soth African song, is exciting and soulful as ever. The arrangements are subtle and tasteful. My only criticism is that they sing together only on one song (the beautiful Kenyan number ""Malaika"") out of twelve. It's like two half solo albums combined! Great listening nonetheless."
3,I'm a Harry fan,Love Harry and Miriam but a number of these songs were unfamiliar and hard to relate to...they were in native languages.
1,Very simplistic approach,Bunch of tips you can hear from an average tennis pro. Nothing on tennis fundamentals or proper technique development. Good video quality which doesn't justify such a high price.
5,christmas gift,husband wanted it so it sits wrapped until he can open it. I am sure it is what he wanted. It is a hard book to find so getting it in any condition will be fine for him.
4,Hand Eye Coordination,"This was tough for my 3 year old. Probably best for 4-6 year old set. Encourages hand eye coordination, very durable and lightweight so it's especially great to take on an airplane or in the car to keep them occupied on long trips. Highly recommend but not for 3 year olds."
5,Don't Buy Gray Market,"I had the sad experience of buying this item from an internet retailer as an 'open box' return, supposedly inspected by Jabra, certified, and resold. Not true. The item arrived DOA and I got the sobering news from Jabra that the item was not under warranty. The retailer lied. Licking my wounds, I bought new, and have been thrilled since the conclusion of the 3 hours it took to charge the first time. Sound clarity is incredible. I have no ambitions to roam about the house, but I can roam about the room. And, being wireless transforms the experience of talking and driving. As a hard-core user of cell phones, I give this an unqualified 5 stars when paired with a bluetooth compatible phone. People I'm talking to are often surprised when they discover I'm on a cell phone. YES! They can hear me now!"
3,Works Okay for Phone/Computer,"The biggest dissapointment I had with this device is that the sound quality is about that of a radio. It may just be that bluetooth can't carry any more bandwidth.Beyond that it works like a charm. I use it for a wireless headset with my phone as well as with iChat on OSX doing audio chats. I also use it to listen to MP3s off iTunes on my commute in.Reception is only mediocre. There's always a little static on the line. I've found that if I keep my phone in my pocket while trying to use it, I get more static than I'm happy with."
3,Decent headset for the money,"I've been using this headset with my Motorola v600 phone for a few months now and for the most part I have been pretty happy with it.Pros:- Good battery life- Easy controls- Comfortable to wear for extended periods of timeCons:- Poor sound quality. I often hear popping and static on the headset regardless of how close I am to the actual phone. It's not horrible, but it can be annoying at times.- Sometimes loses conneciton with the phone. I'm not sure if this is a headset issue or a phone issue but I thought I'd include it here."
1,"Worked great for 2 days, then static city.",That's pretty much the story. I cannot make out what people are saying.
2,Nothing but static,My experience with the headset with Sony Ericsson T610 Phone (T-Mobile) has not been satisfactory. I hear a lot of static and it's operating range is very less.
1,IT WASN'T WORKING WHEN I GOT IT,"I bought Sony Eicsson T 610 mobile phone along with this Jabra Bluetooh.Iwas really suprised with the price of bluetooh. It was only $29.99 with Amazon.com. However, my bluetooh arrived defective : it's not even charging, and doesn't work at all!Moreover, my T-610 arrived unactivated. Today is 3-rd day I have it, and still it's just a good toy, I can't use it!Not to mention that my items were almost 2 weeks delayed!In addition to all said above, i am unable to return my Jabra Bluetooh, because on my online account it says ""Shipping Soon"".The fact is I was delivered 2 days ago.I never expected something like that from Amazon.com, I was a consistent custumer till now. Now I will think twise before buing something from them."
1,Does it block radiation?,"One of the primary functions of a hands-free set should be to prevent radiation from entering the brain. Wired sets do the job well, but, how does this product? Its just another wireless product connected to the ear inches away from the head."
4,Good product but draining your phone battery!!!,"This is a very good product. I don't need to say something good about because there are others who already says and proven it. The only draw back that I experienced with this product is that it drained the battery my Sony Ericsson T610 and Nokia 6600. So, I only use it when I'm in the car now just so that I can prolong my phone battery."
1,Too large,"I hardly ever use this as it's too large and I dislike everyone seeing it. It comes with several different ear pieces, but none of them really fit me well."
2,Jabra FreeSpeak 250,"Gosh, I really wanted to like this headset! The design with the electronics behind the ear is superb, and it's very comfortable to wear. Nevertheless, I was incredibly disappointed to find out that the connection between the headset and my Motorola V600 phone... just a few feet away in my pocket... was absolutely unacceptable. I know that Bluetooth is supposed to be a ""line of sight"" technology, but come on! It should work if the mobile device is in the user's pocket. I don't want to start wearing my phone on a belt clip holder just so that I can go wireless with my headset. It sort of defeats the purpose of being unteathered. I get business calls all day long on my cell phone, and I need a wireless headset that I can wear comfortably with acceptable quality. Unfortunately, this one doesn't work well for me."
2,Not As Good As Claimed,"I bought this with the Motorola V600 flip phone.Bad Comments First; Doesn't work to 30 feet as claimed in Ads.I am lucky to get 3 feet before static. If I have phone on belt and headset in ear = STATIC. Line of sight as in my truck and 3 feet away is OK. If Bluetooth head set is active, and incoming call, phone doesn't ring at phone, only rings at headset which must be in ear to hear it = Many lost calls. Takes time to link up. If you get 15 t0 30 feet away, Bluetooth connection is lost and you have to relink it to phone. Too many aggrivating nuancices to list.The good comments; Unit does fit in ear well and comfortable.When used at short distances and at mostly line of sight it performs well and is better than a wired ear bud. If you can stand all the shortcomings that this product (like so many High Tech products seem to develop after you buy them) has, then it may be better than nothing. Good luck."
5,Inspiration for a Krishn Devotee,"The Biographies of Rasik Saints is an inspiration for a Krishn devotee. It leaves an everlasting impression of dedication, surrender and renunciation of the saints of Vrindaban. It gives hope and confidence to a devotee to find Radha-Krishn in this very lifetime."
2,Poor.,"This video looks like it was compiled by shots from the 80's. Low quality video, annoying music playing non-stop, and the narrator was really difficult to pay attention to, as his voice was rather grating and reminds me of children's educational shows from decades ago. I suppose I was expecting a BBC production and got, well, a video that offers very little insight to China as it really is, through a video that does not, at all, seem like it was from 2007."
4,caveat emptor,"Another reviewer wanted the version of l'appuntamento he'd heard on Ocean's 12--he'll have to buy that soundtrack or Appuntaento con Ornella Vanoni.The thing is,neither album has that mellow,beachy feel throughout.The soundtrack has a lot of electronica(it is pretty cool).And her album is Italian pop from the '70s.If you want the beach-guitar sound like you heard on Ocean's 12--Go Buy Ornella's La Vogglia,La Pazzia--the Ocean's 12 song isn't on it,but the mood is the same.Maybe they'll capitalize on the attention she received from the movie and compile all the songs she performed on one album,so we can skip all that treacly Italian pop."
3,Lost In Translation,"If you're buying this CD Set because of the Ocean's Twelve song Appuntamento, DON""T.. Get the Ocean's Twelve CD for the Original Soul Inspiring Version. I cannot tell you how many songs I've heard over the years, that are arranged by total you know what.But in the hands of a master arranger, come alive. There are many such sleeping beauties waiting to be reborn.."
1,This only contains 1 CD and 12 songs,"The description of what you recieve is incorrect. There aren't 2 cds and 38 songs, only 1 CD and 12 songs. I would suggest you select a different CD if you want to receive certain songs. Overall very disappointing."
3,This is NOT a double CD,"I bought this CD in November 2011. I was under the impression it was a double CD with 19 songs on each disk, total 38 songs, as this is how it is advertised on the Amazon site. I was disappointed when I received the CD and realised it contains only 1 disk with 12 songs. These are 1) Domani E' un Altro Giorno 2) Sassi 3) L' Amore È Come Un Giorno 4) Che Barba Amore Mio 5) Senza Fine 6) Tu Si' 'na Cosa Grande 7) Che Cosa C'è 8) La Musica È Finita 9) Resta Cu' 'mme 10) Ma Mi 11) Hanno Ammazzato Il Mario 12) L' Appuntamento. This is a misrepresentation."
5,Teriffic,"I recieved this book as a gift from my aunt back when I was younger and after a search to find it I realized that it meant something to me. It is one of those books that a person will take to heart, especially those born with cleft lip/cleft palate like me. I ocassionally read it (now that I found it) and it always makes me smile. It is a great read in general for all and the messages of the story will take time to figure out because not everyone will get the same message and feeling from the book. Hope that helps!!"
1,Not a positive message and don't like Christian overtone,"This is not a book I'd want to share with my children, one of whom was born with a bi-lateral cleft lip/palate. It's intended ""positive message"" falls short. The Christianity model, however re-spun, meant to be progressive, is a real turn-off. Illustrations are poor, writing is even less accomplished.I wish I hadn't bought it."
5,Alternative at it's best-Catchy fun Lyrics you like to sing!,"Light and Salvation in not a one time listen CD. This CD grows on the listener and before long you find yourself humming and singing the tunes over and over. My three favorites on the CD are Flatbed Love, Mudflap Cutie and Big Bad Baby, but all of the songs are solid to the bone. Give it a listen and you won't regret it."
4,Nice 2-for-1 collection of consort music.,"The first CD, recorded in 1989, features Michael Chance on six tracks (no texts included), the second CD, recorded in 1987, is solely viol music.There isn't anyone better at this genre than Fretwork so further comment is needless."
5,Wonderful original ideas,"Being a Latina artist, I was very impressed at the uniqueness of these projects. Each one is a twist on a traditional method. They are easy to read and follow and offer a bit of history about where they came from. If I had any complaint it would be that I didn't have time to finish all the projects in one weekend! That's a good thing though, because now I can stay busy for quite a while ;-)"
5,Well Researched!,I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband but then started reading it surreptitiously. It is very interesting and I am not even a Michigan OR a football fan. I am sure my husband will love it.
4,Mediation & conference programs in the federal courts of appeals : a sourcebook for judges and lawyers,The second edition will be available in 2006.
5,Great book for baby,"I bought this book when it came in a four pack of Karen Katz's books. My daughters, who are 1 and 2, love it. When we are reading the pack of books, which is everyday,my oldest saves this one for the last. She likes finding out all of the mommy's hiding places and then when the baby finally finds the mommy, i'm rewarded with a big huge. My 1 year old just likes looking at the pictures now but i'm sure she'll be following in her sisters footsteps soon."
5,My daughter started crawling because of this book!,"My 7 month old daughter loves this book so much that the first time ever she started crawling was to come sit near me while I read it to her! She always laughs and giggles whenever I take this book out and she comes over to sit next to me. Other books, don't hold her attention and she wanders off after a few pages! I definitely recommend it!"
4,"Wish they would make ""untearable flaps""","This is a ""brilliant"" book! My child enjoys lifting the flaps and finding something else besides mommy! When I say ""Nooooooooo"" she giggles and giggles and giggles!The one star I am deducting is for the ""binding"" of the book! Wish it had sturdier flaps! After using cello tapes and what nots, we gave up and now we can see rubber duck inside the shower.... giving away the suspense.This book is great for dads to read to their kids! It speaks the truth! It is late morning on a Saturday.. you need your power breakfast before getting ready for a marathon ESPN/College football day! You look and look for the mommy....all the while dragging the kid with you... along the way you find all kinds of mess (wagon, ball, rubber ducks etcetera etcetera) around the house and finally find mommy STILL under the sheets.... IHOP here I come!"
4,Baby's Mommy is reading this book again.,"This is another cute Karen Katz book with wonderful illustrations. My 18-month-old loves to lift up the flaps to look for ""mommy"" and has been enjoying it since he got it for his first birthday. It's a good book for him to look at by himself but even more fun when we read it together, which is often."
3,Where is Baby's Mommy?,"My 20-month daughter absolutely loves this book. Lifting all the flaps and being suprised everytime to see what is behind them. Always when she finds the Mommy I say "" There's mommy"" she looks at me with her big brown eyes and says ""NO"" and points to me and says ""Mommy"". The book is absolutely ADORABLE."
2,Missing Flaps,"The product said it was in good shape, but when I received it some flaps were missing. This was disappointing."
1,Will not buy books used in the future,"This is about New Chapter Recycling, Inc. who sold us the book, not the book itself. The book would be great- if it wasn't damaged to the point that one of the lift the flap areas was replaced by a post it! Yes a ""post it"" sticker is what the company sent the book with- to work as one of the pages. I can understand a little wear and tear, but, when actual parts and words of the book are missing- you shouldn't sell it!!! As anyone with kids knows, a post it won't last long as a stand in for the flap... I guess they just figure we have post its at home- oh and we are creative enough to make up the words that are missing as well- thanks!"
1,Strange.,"I purchased the Grandma and Me and Counting Kisses books by the same author and it was so cute so I thought buying more would be a no-brainer.I was disappointed when I bought this title and the Daddy and Me. They were both unusual. In this book the child is looking for her mommy and in the end finds her in bed under the covers, it was just a strange place to find the mommy at the end of the book.I returned the book."
1,where is baby's mommy,"I bought this book used but i got THE book torn apart instead. The pages were torn , it was terrible. I paid to send it back to the seller and i have heard nothing .Do not use this seller!"
5,Loved It!!,Karen Katz does beautiful work. I love the interaction I can have with my son while we read because of the flip-book action.
5,A pleaser for months now,"I got this for my daughter at 10 months, and she is 15 months now and still loves it. (Even though she has ripped out 1 flap)Something very intruiging about looking for mommy under tha flaps and finding favourite toys. I also like the fact that the baby character can be a boy or a girl. I highly recommened!"
5,My Backhand- From a problem to a Formidable weapon.,"This DVD is worth its weight in gold. After countless lessons I really never developed a descent backhand, -it was always my weakness. Thanks to Tom Averys, Consistent Tennis Wins - The Backhand, my backhand is now a stroke that I am proud to own. This DVD taught me to anticipate, set up my backswing and generate POWER on the backswing and consistantly have my racquet level at contact with the ball. The ball leaves my racquet now, with greater topspin, more power and racquet speed and certainly greater control. This DVD is a must have."
4,Straight forward teaching,"One of the main reasons I like Tom Avery's style is his straight forward teaching methods with easy to follow and remember instruction. He doesn't overcomplicate what he teaches, just breaks it down nicely in easy to understand segments."
2,Farr fails as an historian and excells as painter with broad,"brush strokes. Never before have I read such conjecture...truly, I am appalled by the liberties Farr takes in construing the facts to suit her case. Indeed, I too am of the opinion that Marie Antoinette and Fersen were lovers; however nothing concrete has ever surfaced in any correspondence before and after the Queen's death to concusively determine the exact nature of the relationship. According to the publisher, Farr makes use of previously unpublished documents...really? Which ones? Did I miss something? This message is less a review to benefit other readers than a severe admonition to Farr: you have given the public nothing with this tissue of loosely woven fantasy...seemingly your fantasy. Stanley Loomis wrote the definitive book on this subject with The Fatal Friendship. Don't flatter yourself, Farr."
3,Hawkwind - 'Distant Horizons' (EBS),"Decent late '90's effort by the band,which at the time included Brock,Ron Tree,drummer Richard Chadwick and new(at the time)guitarist Jerry Richards.Believe me,Richards fits in rather well with Hawkwind.'Distant Horizons' is their follow-up to their 'Alien 4' disc(see my review).Remember I had a tough time getting a copy of this CD.More in the direction of hard rock perhaps than 'space rock' but 'Distant...' does have it's moments.Like the gem ""Phetamine Street"",the semi-heavy ""Alchemy"",""Reptoid Vision"",""Wheels""(sounds good live,heard a bootleg of a US show with this track)and the techno-like ""Taxi For Max"".Good,just not great."
4,SPIRIT OF HAWKWIND SOARS INTO THE NEXT MILLENIUM,"The world's longest running and best spacerock band ever returns to classic form on this release. ""New"" member Ron Tree gives the band some of the same vibe as Calvert did in the classic daze while the addition of Jerry Richards on lead guitar brings backs the best aspects of the Chronicle-era bands heaviness, while sidestepping the occasional metal moves of that era which could make that particular lineup sound a little safe at times. ""Reptoid Vision"" and ""Phetamine Street"" are standouts, classic HW blends of heavy rock, psychedelia, and punk. Apparently this CD was rushed out before the band felt it was ready by their manager (who also supplied fairly generic artwork, without the band's permission) but the results are still very compelling. The followup CD, ""In Your Area"" is also strong. C'mon people, support this band!"
4,hawkwind continues to cover new ground and expand its scope.,"Distant Horizons"" marks a return of this band to the forefront of rock vanguard. Featuring all new material, the band has two new members and looks to expand its scope in new directions. The title track seems to combine the bands' old genre with a Carribbean sound. ""Phetamine Street"" then goes stone cold punk. Other highlights are ""Reptoid Vision"", which rocks punk hard. Waiamea Bay is more ambient. The album as a whole is the best Hawkwind effort in a long while, and this fan believes other Hawkwind fans will consider it a ""must"" to have in their collection. People new to Hawkwind will find a band with diverse styles and more than competent rock sensibilities. dhsparkman@hotmail.com"
5,EMI delivers best ELO remasters!,"The second in EMI's First Light series of remasters showing the formative evolution of the early Electric Light Orchestra, featuring members of ELO and the Move, this beautiful two disc collection is chockful of rare and lost photos, great alternative and missing album tracks, informative and entertaining interviews and essays and more versions of ""Roll Over Beethoven"" than you could shake an orchestra conductor's baton at! Disc Two titled ""The Lost Planet"" was the aborted name of ELO's follow up album, until Roy Wood quit the band and shortly starting having hits with Wizzard. This disc features great lost archival recordings that sound fresh today as the day they were recorded. The tracks that feature ex-Move vocalist Carl Wayne sound like singles that should have been in every Brit-pop fan's jukebox. A must have for prog rock and serious ELO fans."
5,"CRITICS, EAT YOUR HEARTS OUT!!","To all the so-called critics that tried to gave this movie a one-star to try to discourage people from seeing it, WELL........eat your hearts out, pick up your face and tuck your tail between your legs. THIS MOVIE WAS OFF THE HOOK!! I can relate to so much of it. I love Tyler Perry's work and I encourage everyone to support him as an strong, upcoming African-American. This movie was an excellent combination of laughter and drama with some powerful messages, and he truly has a God-given talent to mix them all and come out with a HIT! I'm overjoyed that it debuted and NO. 1 at the box office. With God, you can't go wrong. Tyler, keep it coming!!! You got my FULL support!"
5,SCOOP,EVERYTHING THAT TYLER PERRY DOES IS AWESOME. Madea is Hilarious to say the least. Purchasing this DVD is just adding on to my Tyler Perry collection!
3,Not a very good movie.,"This movie was not very interesting , and a bit confusing at times. I didn't really laugh at the scenes that were suppose to be funny, because they weren't. This movie was too slow, and the performances were D average. Folks save your money, and go watch a better film like Big Momma's House, at least that doesn't try to mix comedy and drama together to make a movie like this does."
1,More Horrid Minstrelsy For Simple Minded Black Folks....,"This is a total waste of film and time. Overloaded with stereotypes and over-the-top acting by b-list wannabees, ""Diary..."" will certainly be a hit with black audiences conditioned to expect very little, but I find it pointless and somewhat disheartening (and I'm a Black man)that we keep buying into the same old thing year after year and then wonder why we can't move ahead. While I admire Tyler Perry's moxie and ambition, I think we deserve better in the 21st century. Please, don't waste your time on this useless drivel."
4,"Funny, funny, funny","I went to see ""Diary"" on a lark and was pleasantly surprised. I liked all the church and gospel music but most importantly I liked the sweet and tender lover story. I found Kimerly Elise to be wonderful. Go and see this film. It's so rare that we get to see people color in real life stories with no bad language. I don't think white America gets us. This film got us. I am a happy black woman who sees lots of movies."
3,Diary of a mad black woman (the play),Was okay but thought the movie was better. I really like his plays so i thought this one would be good too.
3,God Lord...,this play is nothing like Madea's class renunion or like Madea goes to jail.. except for Tyler Perry's performance.. all the others sucked big time..
4,Great for the price,"This tool is usefull, cheap and have good quality for the price.Highly recommended, you can remove or put a chip in his socket in a secure and easy way."
3,Skip the first three chapters,"If you want to know what data warehousing is all about, skip the first few chapters. It will be much better if the author can devote more pages to explain the process of denormalisation, an important process in building the data warehouse as suggested."
5,Excellent technical info for both DBAs and non-DBAs,This clearly written book book can be comprehended by both DBAs and non-DBAs. The authors have an excellent grasp of what is important in real world implementations.
5,Excellent,This book is really excellent because it covers all the features of Oracle8 which are essential for Data Warehousing and also discusses about MOLAP products.
2,"""Happy Feet "" worked. I've lost my desire for ""... Desire.""","I'll admit it... I was indeed spoiled by Happy Feet - and so were the countless people I shared it with - youngsters and geezers alike. That was a unique sound: good lyrics, classic compositions, and an excellent lead of piano and guitar. What happened on Twisted Desire? Hey, Souvenirs -- Happy Feet worked! The tunes, the vocals, everything! (What'd you do with Gill? We miss him. He covered every potentially dead spot.) Anyway, Twisted Desire? I think I was the first to get it, and I'm probably out of line, but to me, it's like every track is a score from a South American ""B"" movie. C'mon guys... bring back those 40's-type classics. Bring back Glover Gill; and Olivier - get your voice back in the fray... Chrysta's great, but hey, she doesn't need to dominate every tune. Go back and listen to Happy Feet - then Twisted Desire. It ain't too hard to figure out."
5,Supremo!!,"I've been a ""Souvenir"" fan from the time they startedplaying at the Continental Club with their three piece band. HappyFeet is one of the best albums recorded in recent years and will be hard to beat. I found it hard to listen to this album and enjoy,at first, because it was not the classic swing that I had come to expect from this band. Then I listened to it twice and it sounded better and then a third time I loved it!!!"
5,"times are a changin', so is the music","I ask you, what would a band be without evolution? This CD is incredible, just as was Happy Feet AND Souvonica. The musicianship is truly amazing and their talent exceeds most bands. Check it out!"
2,"nothing like ""happy feet""","If you've listened to ""happy feet"" and think you'd recognize the music of 8 1/2 Souvenirs in a blindfold test, you probably wouldn't pass the test of ""twisted desire""... unfortunately,it sounds more like the Brian Setzer Orchestra with a female singer than it sounds like ""happy feet""... too bad... ""happy feet"", with its french cafe/django influence was light,refreshing, and, well, happy! don't bother with ""twisted desire"" if you're looking for more of ""happy feet"" or string swing... too commercial of a sound this time."
4,rare book,very nice book tos hare with japanese amercian kids who know nothing about the interment in the our own country. What a big shock for them..and this wonderful book tell abou tht hier undauted spirit this book is great. thanks
4,Japanese cookbook and more,"With trips to local Asian supermarket, I am ready to try the recipes presented in this book. True, you cannot find many of the necessary ingredients for Japanese cooking in local grocery store, but well... there are things that are not substitutable. I tried about 14 recipes from the book, and I can easily make about 60% of the recipes, but the question is: do I have enough time to prepare them all. The method of cooking presented in this book are mostly straight-forward. The groupings make it easier to choose the dish, for example, deep-fried dishes, one-pot dishes, grilled-dishes, sushi, etc, even dessert! Ms. Fuller Slack also includes a comprehensive explanation about the Japanese cooking style, tradition and tips at the beginning of each chapter. I found this especially informative. Bottom line is, this is more than just a cookbook, and they are intended for Americans who are enthusiastic with Japanese cooking who are prepared to do a little bit of work."
2,No hamburgers Japanese-style here,"If you, like me, hope for a collection of Japanese recipes you could easily reproduce with standard staples from your local supermarket, you might, like me, be disappointed. While amusing and informative in terms of Japanese culinary traditions, Susan Fuller Slack's book offers recipes that, by and large, demand scores of ingredients that don't even have English names, leave alone a place on a regular supermarket's shelves. Sure, you can order them through mail or find them in specialty or very well-stocked health food stores, but let's face the facts: Japanese Cooking? Yes. For the American Table? Not bloody likely."
4,first impression excellent - except for the painfully small font!,"I've only read the first chapter so far, my first impressions of the content are excellent, but I have a complaint for the publisher: the font is painfully small and makes it actually a bit of struggle to read.The ideas are very dense, so I would tend to make the font and line spacing a bit bigger than usual to reduce the strain in that area of comprehension and save the reader's mental energy for understanding the ideas rather than screwing their eyes up at the type. I'm not exaggerating - it's like the size they usually print footnotes in!"
5,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!!,"This book was reaaly good! The girls win a lottery and decide to use the money to go to California. Dawn thinks the woman her dad is dating(Carol)is trying to act like one of them, Morlly is spending all her money on make to look like a california girl, Claudia found her dream guy,Stacy learned how to surf, Jesse get in a fight with her best friend, and much more happen to the girls. To get get the whole story READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!"
5,"I LOVED this book, but I don't get how the BSC won the lottery...","I really don't get the part about how the BSC won the lottery, but who cares. This was a GREAT BOOK! First the BSC wins the lottery. With the winning money, they decide to go with Dawn, to California! They have a blast! Kristy gets in a kind-of-a-fight with the We Love Kids Club, Mary anne again, [just like Stacey's Mistake,] sound like a walking glide book, and is in love with Hollywood, Claudia, finds the LOVE of her life, Stacey has a ball learning to surf with her buddies, Dawn does not like her dad's new girlfriend, [Coral] Mallory, spends all her money [and time] on makeup, and making her hair blonde, and Jessi gets in a fight with Mallory. And, in all that excitement, they still have time for what they do best, BABY-SITTING!"
3,Return to Nampara (sort of...),"As a long-time fan of Masterpiece Theatre's ""Poldark"" sagas, I was pleasantly surprised to find a new edition to the video epic. Sadly, none of the original stars came back to make this sequel. It's difficult to accept the new cast at first, but they do grow on you and soon you find yourself back in Cornwall enjoying an exciting story. Unfortunately, the movie abruptly ends just when you start to feel back at home. If this is a movie to be followed by more sequels, hurray and sign me up! As a stand-alone film, it is little more than a quick reunion with characters you once cared a lot about in the mini series. Well-acted, but ultimately going no where."
2,Buy the original series from amazon.co.uk,"Don't waste your money on this DVD. It is fragmented and does not have the quality the original series has. If you have enjoyed the series from the BBC, you should purchase the complete series from Amazon UK (you do need to have a region free DVD player though). It is an investment, which gives about 24 hours of addicting televison. Robin Ellis and Angharad Rees are perfectly cast as Ross and Demelza Poldark. And although the series also strays from the books sometimes, it keeps the overall story intact. Of course production values are always less than with comtemporary movies or productions, but I find that good acting and a good script are more important. It is a shame though that they have edited the series (for contractual reasons it says on the cover of the DVD box) and I always wonder why."
2,OK - But Not the Entire Story,"I expected something a little different when I bought this Title. Instead of getting an entire movie, I felt as if I was coming in on the middle of a TV series. My feelings were amplified when the ""movie"" ended without conclusion - my only questions are: When will the ""sequels"" be available? Why was this made if it's the only one?"
3,"Would have been a great movie, but...","This had the makings of a great movie, but it ended too abruptly. In fact, it ended as if there were more episodes to follow. Apparently this movie met with lukewarm response from the public and the powers-that-be decided to axe it. Not a very smart decidion! They didn't give this movie an opportunity to build a fan-base of its own via video sales.Still, it is a good movie to watch, especially if you are a Ioan Gruffudd fan. Just do not expect an ending."
3,Ads in the middle of the film!,"This is really a great film, as many others have discussed at length in their reviews. However, Eros film company has decided to interrupt it at least 4 times with ads! This is the first time ive ever seen such a weird and irritating thing on a DVD, I expect it from cheap cable tv stations but definitely not from a purchased DVD. I'm so annoyed I'm tempted to return it!"
4,Work well for their stated purpose,"I have four of these drawers and they were a bit challenging to put together because the slot on the drawer front didn't seem to line up where it attaches to the composite bottom. My teenage son saw me struggling with it, took over and had them all assembled in minutes. No alterations were necessary. I thought the hardware was quite good, but these drawers won't work if you're planning on storing heavy items like books, photo alblums, magazines or tools. They work great for underwear and socks.Quality of finish could be better, but I wasn't expecting a high-end quality piece of bedroom furniture. If you want that quality, then hire a carpenter for a custom fit and finish. The total shipped price for one drawer is pretty much in line with other sites."
5,Very nice closet.,"We bought this unit as part of a complete set of John Louis closet units. The drawers are very well designed but it did take a while to assemble, but no big deal.We originally saw this closet collection in Home Depot and then found great discounts on the web, elsewhere. However, turns out a lot of these discounted products were cosmetic defectives and the sellers are basically selling customer returns or factory defectives. We bought a few of these and were able to juggle the construction so defects and marks were hidden, but it is probably easier to buy first quality directly from HD or Target.com.This is a very nice closet, but be prepared for many hours of construction, if you buy a complete set-up. We needed to call customer service twice and their help is SUPERB!"
1,TOTAL RIP OFF!!! BEWARE!!!,"The picture is misleading -- THERE IS ONLY ONE DRAW IN THE PACKAGE -- if you want you see in the picture it will cost hundreds of dollars -- BEWARE, BEWARE, BEWARE"
1,Moving and important,"This book deals with a problem--persistent rural poverty and the tenacity of caste discrimination--that gets increasingly ignored amidst the current focus on India's high-tech modernization. The book is especially effective used in undergraduate teaching because its life stories personalize the issues of poverty and discrimination across the generations, offsetting the stereotypical undergraduate view of India as a land of Bollywood glitz and call centers. I urge everyone to read it, and urge publisher to keep it in print."
5,Chained...was off the chain!,"Just finished reading Chained and this was a good read. This book was not like any other book because in most books those in the game are men but this book showed how woman could be in the game, be in charge and that women always find ways to come out on top even if there are obstacles. Jaz and Trouble are true friends who stick by each other through thick and thin. They make sure they have each others back in the lifestyle that they choose, along the way they also find people who care for them and have there back. This book was definitely a page turner and kept you on your toes wanting to know more. I recommend this book to people!"
2,"Buy Wisconsin Death Trip, leave this alone","Don't even listen to this album before checking out their first release, Wisconsin Death Trip. Compared to that album, this is absolutely horrible. Songs lack variation, creativity, and depth. I realize many people attach these descriptions to all of nu-metal, but I feel their first album achieves all three despite the musical style.Anyway, back to this travesty:Wayne's vocals have two modes on this album: distorted to the point of sounding like the chipmunks and trying to scream with no lungs to back it up.I would've given it 1 star, but I've heard worse. Not much, mind you, but I have."
1,another let down,this album is just as crappy as Shadow Zone. Static X needs to go back to the days of WDT and Machine
1,.....,"To: Nathaniel E. Craigthat said""This is a good album, not their best. It sounds so much like wisconsin death trip and machine. Shadow zone was the only somewhat diverse album they put out so far and also their best album so far.""What the hell are you talking about. This album doz not sound like WDT and Machine! WDT AND MACHINE WERE THERE BEST ALBUMS!!! Sence then They have gone freaking downhill!!! It doznt even sound like those two albums at all, you need you ears checked. This album blows"
4,Good album,"The first album of theirs i owned was wisconsin death trip and this album was slightly different, their songs where more well composed but less heavy."
2,huh?,"Call Static-X nu-metal all you want, but I think they're far better than any of the genre's contemporaries. What bugs me is their inability to craft an entire, cohesive album. Machine was a highlight of their career, but also somewhat immature, thoughtless. Shadow Zone appeared out of nowhere and consequently went nowhere. So I was hoping Static-X had learned from their mistakes (including that child-molestation crap) w/ Start a War. Tracks 1-6 are incredibly promising. But they lost me w/ Track 7 the minute I heard Wayne whining about being, ahem, ""a piece of ass."" Note to Mr. Static: I don't ever want to hear about ass unless you're kicking it! And to sum it up, the rest of the songs only go downhill from there, which is not a reason to purchase this album. I'd download the first half from a friend."
2,Oddly disappointed,"Im not sure why, but Static-X seems to have lost something along with Tripp Eisen. Koichi Fukuda did well in the first album,Wisconsin Death Trip, he seems to have lost touch with the workings of this particular band. The music is all screaming and banging away at instruments, with no real talent involved. While this is acceptable of an up-and-coming band, for an established name like Static-X it is a bit of a let-down."
2,what happened,It is like Static X isn't trying to write anymore. The songs are like they put them together in a minute or less. If you liked Wisconsin Deathtrip and Machine then you should avoid this cd. If you like Beneath Between Beyond then you will definately like this cd.
3,A dissapointment,What can i say this is nu-metal and that is it. This is the first Static X Cd i ever had and wil probaly be the last. This cd is ok at best. Some songs are good but for the most part i get bored with it after a while. Don't get me wrong i like some nu-meta but this is not the best nu-metal i ever heard. They vary their sound too much and every song sounds like another band doing it. I admire their range but nothing is outstanding with them. I heard this album was good but was kinda diappointed when i got it. For all you Static X fans out there no offense intended but i just dont care for the X that much not my favorite.
3,This Is Crap,Static x is finished without tripp eisen as guitarist the new album is good but would be better if tripp was there instead of the orginal guitarist from their first album wisconsin Death Trip
3,"If you like WDT and Machine, stay away from this one.","hear the entire album here: http://www.mtv2.com/#leak/static_xit is probably even worse than Shadow Zone, they have completely lost touch with what made them a great band. Wisconsin Death Trip and Machine were pure godlyness, and now they sound like a generic radio metal band. What a freaking shame, at least Fear Factory are still keeping it real. Static-X have truely let me down with this album, and it looks like they will keep on getting worse and more generic (can you say Metallica?)."
3,What Ever Happen To Evil Disco?,"Ok read the title! Now I think Wanye Static and the rest of the members of Static X need to read that, because his band is not going in the direction everyone though they would. Start a War is a sad album compaired to Wisconsin Death Trip, which was perfect, or Machine which was nasty and fun to listen to, and even Shadow Zone looks and sounds better than this new release. Come on I mean 10 songs wow! The best part of it all is that the band said they tried their hardest on this new record, ok I hope that was a lie because other than a couple of good songs, not great songs, this ablum would suffer big time. Lets hope this cd is just a error for Static X. Lets just cross our fingers and just hope they don't put out another album like this one."
4,Definitely better than Shadow Zone and Machine...,"But... this album is nowhere near industrial, which will alienate most fans of WDT. WDT was one of the best industrial albums I've heard, and Start a War is nothing like it. It combines a lot of elements from all of their previous works and even has some guitar solos! With this said, I think anyone who is a fan of Machine and Shadow Zone will think of this album as godlike. However, fans of soley WDT will probably criticize this merely by the fact that there aren't enough industrial elements to it."
5,Best metal of the year,"While Slipknot is hogging all the metal spotlight, Static-X is quietly one of the best metal bands around. This cd has alot of catchy songs and all songs are top notch. I prefer Static-X in concert to a Slipknot. I saw Static-X in concert and they pack more in an hour then most bands care too. If you get to see them live, dont hesitate, its well worth it. If not pick up this cd, its one of the best cds of the year."
5,SATC Fans must have,"It is sooo amazing. But do not expect something that you do not know already. The book has episode guides from season 1-4, and what the actors/producers thought of that episode. All the glamorous outfits worn by the girls are dissected, fantastic for those who want to copy the looks!! The pictures are all gorgeous. A little bit behind the scene pictures, but do not expect too much in that department. Readers definitely do get what the actresses were thinking when playing the show. If you have watched all the show, there is not too many things that you do not know already. But, this book is a must have if you a die hard fan or if you want a compliation of what happened in the first 4 seasons in print. Great memorabillia that fans will indeed keep sake in 10-20 years. I know I will."
5,As fabulous as the ladies on SATC!!!!,"My hubby got this book for me for our first anniversary (paper... ;>), and I couldn't put it down! It has gorgeous pictures, including captions telling you the designers of some of the ladies' outfits (not that I could afford any of them, but a gal can dream!)It profiles all the actors--even the guys! All episodes from the first 4 seasons are described in detail, with pictures and memorable quotes from the episodes as well as from the actors and behind-the-scenes people. I also loved hearing about the writers and how they draw from their own lives. This book couldn't be better!!!"
4,SATC: The place to be,"I love Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte as if I knew them. So when this book was published, I didnt know what all the hoopla was about it, until I peeked inside...it was gorgeous! It does exactly what the girls do on the show...kiss and tell... character backgrounds(SATC and real life), clothing over the years, favorite moments--all drew me in to buying this book.Although, they STILL did not release Mr. Big's first name in this book, it is a great buy for your friend(s) who just wont shut up about SATC on Monday mornings.... The book gives a nice synopsis of each episode from seasons 1-4. I will be more excited to buy a revised copy with seasons 1-6, because I love Sex and the City!!"
3,i expected more!,"It is an ok book, nothing spectacular. It gives an insight into the series and thinking behind costumes etc for the series. I expected a more in-depth analysis but it is not half bad.I guess it could be a must have for the fans and collectors."
5,Perfect Book!!,This book is a must have for every SITC fan. It gives tons of information on the characters and the people who play them.
3,Worth watching,"Poundhound (if you don't know) is the solo project of King's X frontman (and bassist) Doug Pinnick. Doug plays guitar in the project and also handles the lead vocals. Since Doug's voice has matured (and we arent in the 80's anymore) his vocal style is lower and more natural. The songs are often personal and soulfull, more stripped down than some of the older King's X material (and also the strange but amazing Please Come Home...Mr. Bulbous album). The video is marked correctly as ""bootleg"". It is the quality you would expect to get from trading with someone on the net. The color is barely color although the image is sharp enough (2 cameras). If you like the poundhound project or doug's voice, check this out. It is not a lot of dough to scrape up for a full show with Doug. A VCD of this show is also available as a second CD bundled with a special European version of the Please Come Home Mr Bulbous release."
5,trey3 <--- check me out using the community browser!!,"Ok this is it the COOLEST GAME EVER.I got this game a month ago (that was March 1st), and I love it.Why did it take ms so long to write a review?? I have been playing it nonstop, ...well not quite, but practically...anyway,the only downside is you do need a really good system ( but a 300k modem is NOT necessary(I use a 56k modem and I only experience lag occasionally)) like a pentium 3 it is better if you have 4(at least a 16mb graphics card but a 32mb is sooo much better).The pros?? Lots of game types1. Capture and hold2. Capture the flag3. Rabbit4. Deathmatch5. Hunters6. Team hunters7. Bounty (I think there are others but I can't remember)This is a online game so if you are gonna buy for the single- player mod, forget it!!Ultimatally THIS GAME RULES!!!So do yourself a favor **********Buy It***********p.s...."
4,"Good Gameplay, Good Graphics, Fair Chopyness?","Well, in all the anticipation (delaying the game for over a year) I expected less bugs and maybe better guns. The vehicles.. well they still drive like they are on ice.... even the big tanks drive like its floating and yet it has wheels.... hrmm. All and All its a fair game. Sierra really needs a patch out soon! As for the in-game server features its pretty nice. I have a 600mhz, GeForce 32mb (The original GeForce) runs pretty smooth.. so if you got a ATI Rage Pro on a 333mhz comp and play the game..... Do us a favor and don't post a review! cause like the only people who rated with 2 stars are the people who have bad computers... I recomend buying it! I'm sure sierra will fix all the bugs (which there is little of)."
5,This is the greatest game that I have played so far,I like the unique part where you can use vehicels and all sorts of other tactics to play the game. It is a great online game and I would highly suggest it o people who love to play online shooter games.
2,Too complex for the average gamer,"I'm an avid FPS (first person shooter) fan, and I was very much looking forward to playing Tribes 2. I'd read many glowing reviews and heard lots of buzz about the game. Unfortunately, after three separate attempts to get through the tutorial, I was hopelessly bored with the game and annoyed with the physics engine.Bottom line is that this is a complex game that is probably a lot of fun for people who are big into teamplay and resource management, but if you're a die-hard shooter fan like me, I think you'll find that this game's lack of polish and emphasis on complexity is not your cup of tea."
1,Finish the game before you sell it,"Never before have I gotten a game that has an appoligy note built into it. If there are still major defects, the game shouldn't be for sale."
2,well...,"it would have been a good game some years ago, but as a fps, UT is better, as a team game with rts elements, allegiance is better... i rather play allegiance than lose time with tribes 2"
2,Are we beta testing?,This game is too buggy as of 4/01/2001 and I think Sierrarushed this game. Just check out ... forums and you will see hundredsof bug reports and complaints. I played this game on my friend'scomputer and Tribes 2 requires some serious hardware. You'll needGeforce2 and 700MHZ+ CPU to run it with relatively good graphicoptions.I'm not that impressed with Tribes 2(I'm a veteran Tribes1player). It seems Sierra was just after money... They alreadyannounced an expansion pack and it is going to cost ... exp pack for...layed this game on my friend's computer and Tribes 2 requires someserious hardware.

They alreadyannounced an expansion pack and it is going to cost ... exp pack for... I'll pass Tribes 2.
1,Beta quality - don't waste your $$,"Shame on Sierra for releasing a beta quality game. Just go look at the tribes2.com forums - everyone's having serious problems, ranging from crashing to horrible framerates. And that's not even counting the problems with network support.Don't believe the hype. This game is a waste of your money; wait a few months & see if they fix it."
2,"Interesting gameplay, very poor engine.","Okay. Consider this the horrible negative review of the game. I've seen all the other reviews which are like ""YAH BEST GAME EVAR"" but personally.... *sigh*. I have a Pentium 3-650, and a Matrox G400 video card, and this game runs very poorly. In fact, in order to match the smoothness I had in Tribes 1 (with a P2-350 and Voodoo 2 video), I had to turn the detail levels ALL down and even then it was choppy if there was another character on the screen. (and when you have all the detail levels down, the characters look like triangle skeletons and the ground and buildings look like blurred vomit).So, I guess... judge for yourself. I really like Tribes and I like the gameplay in Tribes 2 (they made a lot of advancements that make sense, although vehicles are still a pig to drive), but unless I go buy a GeForce I don't forsee this as getting any better."
1,A real disapointment,The frist tribe's wus awesome but this one is full of bug's for instance if you acidently hit the windows key your computer it locks up and the only thing you can do is a hard restart and as long as it has been out they still have not fixed it. P.S. this is a common problem and everyone i know bought it and won't play it for this reason..........................
1,Does Not Work With Most Graphics Cards,I got this game for my Dell Pentium III 700 and it did not work. My screen flickered when in the game and I could not see anything. I realized that on the bottom of the box it is REQUIRED that you have 1 out of a few of the graphics card listed at the bottom. I have a Diamond Viper Graphics card and it required that I have a Diamond Viper II graphics card. Don't buy this game if you don't have a state of the art graphics card or else.
5,Tribes 2 is the absolute BEST game for the PC!!,"I never liked PC gaming, until I played Tribes 2. This game is exciting and innovative. You can play online with up to 64 people! If you don't think that will be fun, then...go away."
1,Stop! Read this before you spend $... on this game!,"I have been dying for T2 to come out, and I've never been this disappointed in anything I've bought. My machine is a PIII/800 with a Voodoo3 2000 (per the system reqirements), 128 megs of RAM. Tribes2 CRAWLS. The game is absolutely unplayable. I don't know what the reviewers who raved about Tribes2 were running it on, but it certainly isn't anything available in my local computer store.Seems to me like Dynamix left the bad features (i.e. the 5-minute wait for the server list to refresh and poor network performance), and destroyed the good ones (like original Tribes' fast graphics engine and the speed with which the missions loaded). This is a 500+ megabyte pig. ... I'm so sad I could cry."
1,gaming nightmare,"This game and the time spent trying to get it to work properly, even with the appropriate system requirements, was a nightmare. If you are thinking of buying this game, try to torture yourself in another, less costly manner. What a piece of JUNK! Oh, by the way, the technical support from SIERRA was WORSE THAN THE GAME!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"This is not worth...bucks. It is very poor quality software, even after installing and reinstalling it 3 times, it still does not work. My two computer nut friends are having the same problem. Also, it is very similar to the orginal, but the original has better controls, AND IS...BUCKS LESS!!! Get it, NOT THIS!!!"
2,Tribes2 .. Why bother?,I'll get straight to the point... If you have UT don't bother with Tribes 2. Save your $.
1,Waited for Nothing,"I sooooo anticipated the release of this game so I could replace Team Fortress Classic and my Unreal Tournament with a much more imporved game. This game is the worst and I don't have a slow machine, I am running a P4 1.4 GHZ - GeForce 2 Ultra 64 MB of DDR ram with 256 MB of RAM, the game runs great its just lifeless. Steep learning curve that is not worth the time. I love the combination RTS aspects of a FPS online team base shooter. It just doesn't pay off and it is not worth the time."
2,Gaming opinion,"I consider myself a working professional who enjoys the latest FPS. I was really looking forward to Tribes 2 but just removed it from my harddrive. Granted- my specs are on low end- p2 350, 128 mg ram, creative gforce 2 32mb video card, but I just could not get this game to look or play very well. UT and No One Lives forever run fine. In T2, my graphics were choppy, each day brought a new online bug patch, weapons seemed outdated, and all in all, it just wasn't a pleasant playing experience. Counterstrike still rules and Serious Sam (brand new), is a refreshing, low priced, treat. Oh well- maybe this summer when I upgrade to a 1.1 athlon and get cable..."
3,Good if you have Geforce 5 ;),"I just got the game ignoring everyones talk about how poorly it runs on a Voodoo chipset. And boy were they right...I have a Voodoo5 5500 and a P3 1GHZ and this game runs absolutely horrible when playing online.So please stay away if you have a Voodoo card of any kind.Now that out of the way, this game does have alot of promise hence the reason I gave it 3 stars.If they get some more patches out that fix the slowness on the Voodoo chipsets, then I will mostly likely buy another copy since I did take my copy back."
1,Tribes 2? DOH!!!,"Oh, why oh why didn't they stick with their original engine??? I've spent all day playing on my P600 with Radeon card, and it keeps chugging like and old rusty locomotive. It was running well, then 3 bots turned up and killed me immediately because I couldn't move! (this is one example of many) Multiplayer suffers similar problems. I can't believe they've wasted this time making this slow and troubled new engine. A major disappointment because Tribes was one of my favorite games of all time. Well, back to Giants: Citizen Kabuto -- best game I've played in 10 years!"
2,Disappointed,"If you have a Voodoo card (don't believe the box which says it is 3dfx compatable), don't buy this game regardless of your machine specs. I am using a Voodoo5500 and I am lucky if I get 20fps out of it(not unplayable,but not worth it either). The game is so fogged in, that you might as well be playing indoors. It does play ok over the internet though. If you have an Nvidia card(Geforce,Geforce2,TNT) you will probably have better luck. I really liked the first Tribes and thought this one would follow in its footsteps."
4,runs like a pig,"This game has huge potential. My friends and I play team based games on our LAN all the time. I was convinsed that Tribes 2 would be our next addiction. After purchasing the game I found out that sierra dropped Glide support so if you own a 3dfx card your out of luck. Later I found out that you also need to have a very fast processor to run the game, so my PIII 500mhz won't do anyway. The thing I can't get past, is that the Graphics aren't that great. Black and White is 10 times better and runs great on my machine. Tweaking Tribes 2's graphics does nothing for your framerates either. I have emailed sierra several times and have received no personalized response. They tell you to turn down the graphics. Sierra has really missed the boat on this one. Oh well, back to Unreal Tournament."
5,What are they talking about?,"This is a great game. I have a Voodoo 3 card and it runs fine. The graphics are out of this world. Buy this game. The weapons are nice and it is much better than the first one. My only complaint would b with the amount of lag on some of the servers, but what can you do?"
4,"Great game, But doesn't Live Up to it's Hype","Tribes 2 is a game that can be very addicting and fun, if youget over the massive learning curve, for multiplayer. I love in thisgame ... The downside of this game is that it does not surpass it's predecessor. Tribes 2 doen't even live up to it's hype. There really is no major improvement between tribes 1 and 2. And lastly make sure that you have a powerful computer to run this game. I say minimum requirements in my opinion are 800 mhz and any geforce 2 chip."
3,Close but no cigar,"Tribes 2 is a good, immersive and solid game with a steep learning curve. Those looking for a First person shooter will be somewhat disappointed. Yes, it is amazing to be able to wander around huge expanses of land and frag people, but the difficulty in controlling your man as well as the ... weapon selection will turn off fans of QIII and Unreal Tournament (the latter being, by the by, the best EVER in my opinion). Also, the first person mode stinks; I realize Tribes 2 was designed as an online game first, but so was UT and that 1st person mode is great."
3,cool...but not cool enough,The first time I played this game I thought everything about it was superb--the graphics were beautiful--sounds were cool--and just a really cool game in general....but after I played it for about 20 minutes I got extremely bored with it and never wanted to play it again.
2,The Average Guy,"Before buying Tribes 2 know the following: 1. You need a fast computer, my Duron 750 w/ 256MB ram and a 64MB Radeon is not fast enough to run it smoothly when the action heats up. Lag kills. . . 2. Most all of the weapons are slow firing weapons firing slow projectiles making it frustrating to deal with the vast distances you encounter in the game. Think slow Team Fortress grenade launcher on a very large outdoor map. ""You hit the guy! was he standing still?"". . . 3. Steep learning curve. I never played the original Tribes and it is taking a while to learn all the controls and options. . . Overall I find Tribes 2 to be a dissapointment. Counter Strike is still my favorite. First person action is all about immediate response. The game is more immersive if you can react as fast as you would in real life. Tribes 2 needs to pick up the pace."
2,Yeah... This is really stupid...,"Hey, I'm just tellin ya.To tell the truth, this game is really boring.I'm 13 and I told my sister and family that I like this gamevery much. But the truth is that this game suck.Firstable, I don't recommend it to kids who likes easy gameslike 007. This is really hard. When you even try to hit those stupid enemies in multiplayer, you can't even DIRECT HIT.I like games that has good multiplayer, but not this game.I'm tellin ya, there's bunch of butt kickin guys in multiplayer who uses LOTS OF CHEAT!It takes like 5 hours to get good rooms.AND_ what about the single player.BORING~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It has ONLY 5 training mission that are really not helpful.I got bored with this game in 2 DAYS.Don't buy this suckin game. It's NOT worth money.Buy sth like <No one lives forever>, <Return to castle wolfstein>, or <Max Paine> if you like shooting games."
1,Tribes 2 is a giant piece of non-working bloatware,"This game took a huge amount of time to make, delays after delays, and when it actually hit the stores.. I've seen alpha builds that could easily be more stable [....] Oh yea? and what's more.. unless you are running on Dave G's deep blue, you are going to see stick figures running around at 1 fps ... this game is the biggest joke I've ever seen.. UT or Quake 3.. or anything blows this junk away."
2,Disappointed,"I expected more ""mature"" writing. While there were some nice passages describing the landscape and the general ambiance of the area, the writing often felt juvenile and sophomoric when describing his impressions of people and their adventures. He leaves the impression of a smart aleck who gets his kicks from mocking people. It's not only Americans whom he mocks, but also those from Florence and Pisa as well. The juvenile delinquent that he admits he was when he was a teenager still shines through in his writing. I have no doubt that he respects his country, but his lack of respect for people would make me think twice about hiring him as a tourguide."
4,"Delightful, charming read","This is a charming book. English-born Tuscan resident Dario leads tours of his beloved countryside for foreigners. It's the perfect book to read on a plane, and would make a great gift for anyone thinking of going to Italy.Is this an official travel guide for Tuscany? No. It contains just enough tantalizing details about the country, the wine and the people to make the reader want to investigate further. Is it insulting to Americans? Of course not. Dario's anecdotes about some of his clients are humorous, and every tour guide around the world can tell similar stories about foreign tourists, whatever their country of origin. It seems that the only negative reviews here are from Americans, which speaks for itself."
5,Loved it,"While on a trip to Italy last year, I, my husband and then 13-year-old daughter, all read this book, which we had picked up at an English language bookstore in Rome. It was perfect vacation reading - a few passages had us in stitches. In fact, it's the one book we recommend for friends en route to Italy. We still occasionally take it out for a good laugh."
5,Never Too Much Tuscan Sun,"Wonderfully written book, laugh out loud stories! Excellent book for American travelers."
1,TOO MUCH TUSCAN SUN,"As a dual citizen of USA and Italy--I am going to have to agree with Valerie that this book is snotty and actually offensive to all tourists who may travel to Italy. We live part-time in Italy. I have at this point in my life lived on both sides of this book--as a tourist in the beginning and now as a citizen of this wonderful country. I was initially attracted to this book because I did not like Frances Mayes' ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". First of all, this book is boring. If you are looking for a book that details step by step the Chianti Region, obtain this information in a tour book. In addition, after reading comment after comment of Dario's feelings toward ""the hand that feeds him"" I hope that he doesn't think this book is going to increase his business. Save your money and time in reading this book, if you read it, you may think Italy and its people aren't as gracious and welcoming as they really are."
5,A MUST have for your collection!,"I purchased a signed copy of this book from a small shop in Siena, Italy - I don't think I've ever laughed out loud from a book before, but this book had me in tears!!! His tales of his clients are priceless and he has such a great storytelling ability that you're just drawn right in! He also takes great care in explaining and portraying the Italian countryside and culture and you can clearly see his love for his country shine through in the book. Don't wait to buy this - I promise you'll love it!"
1,A waste of time and money,"Insipid, condescending, arrogant, this book manages to look down not only on Americans but also on other Italians, whom he characterizes as short, dark and moustached. The only interesting part about this book is the story behind the Palio and the rivalry among various Tuscan cities, otherwise just skip this poor excuse for a book."
1,what a disappointment,"The premise of this book sounded great; after all, who to better tell funny stories about what so many of us have seen (which isn't pretty) when traveling abroad than such a tour guide?But this book is a major let-down. Sure, he had someone make a pass at him, and some drank too much, and some were late --but that's about as far as his anecdotes go. The encounters he talks about are neither odd, unusual nor amusing enough to make the book worthwhile. Maybe something was lost in translation. The writer does sound pleasant, and maybe that's the problem: he's just too nice to make this interesting."
1,"I wish I had loved it, but................","The title really caught my eye. I loved the Mayes book, and was hoping for perhaps the 'other side'. Plus, having travelled alot in Tuscany, I looked forward to the tidbits and warm sunshiny exploits. The writing was sadly not compelling, and although I did read it through to the end (""maybe the next chapter will have the gem..."") I never found the good parts. It says to me that, even with the potential of great content, the storytellers skills need to be masterful to have a home run. It's not in this book, sorry to say."
1,"Snotty, snide and hateful","I was looking forward to this book with the high hopes that it might be the equal of ""Extra Virgin"" or Peter Mayle's Provencal tales.Instead, Mr. Castagno lines up a procession of exaggerated examples of the protoypical ""ugly Americans"" abroad. Oh, yes, there's at least one American he liked and didn't make fun of (much). Overall, though, he prefers to paint the vast majority of Americans abroad as uncultured, ignorant buffoons.I can't imagine any American ever being willing to hire Mr. Castagno as a guide again, not after reading the apparent level of contempt in which he appears to hold us. And I'll certainly not waste my time or money reading or buying anything else he authors."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This book had the potential to be so much better. Unfortunately, it feels like it was only written to take advantage of Ms. Mayes' fame. Her books aren't favorites of mine, but at least she's sincere in her admiration of Italy and the Italians, and she can create a sweet turn of phrase occasionally.Don't look for good writing in this book - you won't find any. Castagno favors taking cheap shots at people who have paid him to be their guide. Just what we all want to do, right? Pay some guy to make fun of us, and read about what fools we are.I found his tales of juvenile delinquency (breaking into houses in the countryside and treating them as his own) more than a little off putting. He writes about it quite cavalierly, claiming boredom and having a good time with friends. In America, we call that breaking and entering - and people usually go to jail for it!I really disliked this book, and recommend that you look elsewhere for insights into the tour guide business!"
1,Totally Sun Burned,"I have met several from Italy, and many obviously being quite materialistic. I am about to visit the Tuscany region and have done enough homework as a tourist, but not this book. I am a US citizen much of my early life spent in China with a love of food. I have lived in paradise-like places in the US and metropolitan cities elsewhere. Unlike this author, I can say that American tourists are talkative but friendly. I wonder how he would perceive waves of Asian tourists who travel in motor coaches and carry umbrellas under his Tuscan sun? I would rather read Bill Bryson's well-written ""Neither here nor there--travels in Europe"" to see how irritating Europeans equally are, not to mention how so cheap the men there are and try to hit on you without meaning anything. It's just neither in the American or Asian culture."
5,It's exactly like I was told.,The DVD was in very good condition. No complaints. Will buy from you again.Thx
1,DO NOT BUY,"Do not buy this item !If you think you might like to play along with this CD,OR if you have perfect pitch, this CD will blow your mind. Although Bach wrote his concerto in A minor,this CD manages to reproduce it in A flat minor !!!!!!!!!"
3,could've been better,"if the instructor had spent some time working with something other than a drum track it could've been better. mind you, i needed that lesson, not being a drummer myself. being a guitar player and vocalist i sure could've used some work there. maybe if they had labeled it ""sonar x1 drum session"" it could've been better."
1,Not a good movie,"After loving Mononoke and Spirited Away MANY times in the theatre, and loving Castle in the Sky on Dvd; this is probably one of the worst movies that I could imagine someone making of his calibur. What a waste of money. It's nothing like the others, its a Disneylike kid's movie - view and buy it strictly for that."
3,Okay,"After buying Spirited Away - which my family loved, I wanted to purchase more movies by Hayao Miyazaki. Kiki's Delivery Service was AVERAGE, nice story but nothing that stands out, $24 was way too much for this movie."
3,I guess it wasn't for me,"I really enjoy most of Miyazaki's work; especially ""Spirited Away"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro"". I had very high expectations of this, given it's popularity. For whatever reason, it didn't do it for me.Part of it was the lead character, Kiki, who I found to be a little to saccharine sweet. For my tatse, Kiki had a little too much of that happy-happy ""Hey kids - let's put on a show"" type of hyper-enthusiasm. In contrast, you don't find this in the slow lovely warmth of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" or the mishevious energy of ""Sprited Away.""At any rate, despite the wonderful animation, I didn't get into this film as I have others. Perhaps it's my fault. At any rate, three stars."
2,"Great Movie, Bad release","One of my favorite movies Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have made. but the release that Buena Vista made is terrible. The original intro and end credits songs are gone and replaced with songs that have no rhythm. Not to mention the bad job on the dubbing. If your a fan of Miyazaki and wanna see this movie, dont buy this version, just buy a bootleg somewhere."
4,This is for my son.,"I watched this with my son. It turned out quite well, but not quite as good as some of the others by this artist. The ending seemed just to leave thing open to every day life, which was fine but it seemed a bit anti-climactic. In any event, overall the story was quite good and the animation is quite superb."
5,I want to ride a broom,We love the Studio Ghibli movies and this one is no exception. Our son (5) enjoys it a lot and so do we. Not loud or flashy but lovely :D
3,Dissapointing...,"This version of the movie is very disappointing to me. I don't have anything against the movie itself because I love the VHS version. One of a few reasons for my lower rating of this is because they've changed a lot of Jiji's lines that were hilarious in English. They did also change and delete some other character's lines too. Not to mention a lot of the music has been altered an then there is lots of added in music that isn't necessary. There are also parts that sound distorted, especially at the beginning. The voices are different too, but only in parts of the movie that they decided to change. Overall I believe the previous version were fine the way they were and there was no need for all the various changes."
2,flawed DVD edition,"This review is forKiki's Delivery Service: Special Edition - 2-Disc DVD. Up until a recent move, when it went missing, we had a different DVD edition of this movie,Kiki's Delivery Service.If you're already used to any previous edition of the movie (VHS, DVD, just seeing it on The Disney Channel back in the day), you should know three things about this particular copy:1. They changed the intro song. The English song has been replaced with the Japanese song.2. The audio quality for dialogue is not as good. Actors often sound as if their voices are being projected through a fan.3. Some bits of dialogue have been removed (such as when Gigi used to say ""They're calling you an egg stealer. And you don't want to know what else."" -he now just says ""they're calling you an egg stealer"" and it sounds noticeably clipped)."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,This is a wonderful story with beautiful graphics ...I bought it for my god daughter (age 2) & naturally I checked it out before giving it to her & I loved it so much I bought one for myself! Oh..and she loves it too! This book is for all ages!
5,Loved it!,"I really liked this movie, and I really want to add it to my (and my daughter's) collection. I just want it on DVD! I don't want to buy any more vhs tapes."
5,A delightful adventure,"This is one of Miyazaki's best. He combines his love for exotic moving landscapes that are a gorgeous visual feast. As well as lovely imagery this movie has a story about the coming of age of a young witch who must grow up, and most importantly gather her courage to be a strong young woman. This movie is truly something that all young girls should watch. Its right up there with the classic Disney movies: Ariel, Lady & the Tramp, Beauty & the Beast...This is something you should definitely not miss out."
5,Utterly Engrossing,"A point I would like to stress in addition to the comments already posted is that this is not ""just"" a movie for kids. Not only is it aesthitically impressive but the characters and dialogue are on a level well above most motion pictures made these days - animated or otherwise. Rather than going for slapstick comedy and overly melodramatic moments the plot unfolds at a leisurely pace allowing viewers to really sink in and enjoy each of the numerous wonderful aspects of the movie. Kiki's Delivery Service has such depth that repeated viewings are as engrossing, if not more so, than the first, for people of any age - the sure sign of a classic."
5,"Excellent film, if you don't watch it you have no taste","This film is just so good, it makes you feel great inside. It's just excellent. go see it. Miyazaki rules."
5,Kiki's Delivery Service,"I just love this film,it's probably one of my favorite animated film of all time.It starts out with a thirteen year old witch going for training in another part of the country.It ends being a great animated feature.If you don't have a copy of this film get one, because you will not be sorry.You will end up loving this movie and love all of the director other works also. This film is Phil Hartman's last performance."
5,Kiki's Delivery Service,"Kiki's Delivery Service invokes the sense adventures and the innocence of childhood rite. It's a family fun film, which I have come to enjoy. I did not discover Hayao Miyazaki till Disney TV aired this piece of film years ago, and became an instant cult favorite of mine. I could watch this every day and not grow bored of it! And now I'm an avid collector of his films, its so super addicting!"
5,The best anime film!,"This was a very good movie. I saw it on tv once. it's about a girl named kiki with her cat gigi(or jiji?). they travel to a city that kinda looks like itay. there, she stays with a baker and helps her deliver her goods for a place to stay in return. Kiki is faced to many problems throught the story, like Jiji running off with another cat and Kik not beng able to rideher brom. at te end of this story, I had tears in my eyes! This movie is a must-have for many peoe! Please dont get left out!"
5,A gem for all ages,"We all wanted to learn how to fly on a broomstick! Kiki is an incredible, lovely story which warms the heart. A must see for Animation fans and collectors alike. Having seen Kiki's in it's original Japanese I was suprised to be swept away by the story again in English. I found myself adding this to my collection. It is the only English Dubbed Japanese film I have purchased."
4,Kiki Delivers the Goods,"We picked this movie to complete our Miyazaki collection. Our three young children are in love with Totoro, Howl's Castle, and Ponyo and wanted more of the same. Kiki feels longer than it really is, and it's not quite as much fun as Totoro or Ponyo, but it obvisously bears the stamp of the same master film-maker our kids have come to know and love."
4,Very Entertaining and fun story,My 2 year old likes the movie and finds it entertaining. I like that it has no violence and the story is sweet. I recommend it.
5,Great Movie,This movie is very simple. The animation isn't fancy. The story is simple. And that's why it works. A great story of a little girl learning life lessons.
5,Not just a kid's movie,"Kiki's Delivery Service, like all of Miyazaki's films, has a depth and emotional resonance that can be appreciated by all audiences.This film deals with growing up, and also finding yourself. Its plucky heroine provides a lesson that isn't preachy and can certainly hit home with children, adults, and everyone in between."
3,Very entertaining!,"This movie was very good, even though I'm barely an anime fan. This movie reminded me of Sabrina The Teenage Witch a little bit. Kiki and Sabrina both have talking cats. Overall, this movie was really good."
5,What a wonderful masterpiece,"Kiki is 13 of age who is training to be a witch. By tradition, it is for Kiki to leave her home to spend a year alone in a new town to establish herself as a full witch. Kiki sets herself on her mother's broom with her closest companion, Jiji, a loquacious black cat. She flies off to her new life."
4,A nice family film.,Kiki's Delivery Service is the story of a young witch who leaves home to apprentice in another town. It is a coming of age movie that the whole family will enjoy. Kiki must learn to grow and develop confidence in herself.While not my favorite from director Miyazaki it is still very good. the Japanese Amine is wonderful and this one is not violent as some other amine.
5,Just enjoy the magic!,"After reading all of the critiques of this DVD presentation, I am amazed that I still enjoy watching this film. Instead of thinking too much about the technical aspects of translation, try sitting down with this movie and let its beatiful story roll over you. It will make you wish that you were 13 years old again, when your innocent view of the world was both shaken and renewed by the acts of others. If you are a parent, you must buy this for your jaded, modern children. Mine were entranced, presumably by the idea that Kikki could live on her own whle still maintaining her dignity and sense of responsibility to her new friends."
5,"Miyazaki-san,You've Done It Again!","Poor Kiki,alone in the world on her first witches' apprentice job.Stuck in a town where no one has seen a witch for a while,she descovers that a little magic is just what the doctor ordered! Along with Jiji(Phil Hartman,who really did an exquisite job...speaking from a fan's piont of veiw),her talking black cat,she starts her very own delivery service.Things are going great until....Oops!Don't wanna spoil it for everyone! Just watch and you'll see,Kiki is worth every penny you spend!"
3,Very silly - not for adults,"I bought this movie under recommendation that it could be enjoyed by adults as well.Well... it is very silly and sappy. I could hardly recognize it as a movie made by same director of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. Every characted laughs in that standard anime way (with the mouth open wide showing the teeth and the tongue) all the time! Kiki's cat Gigi (with the voice of Phil Hartman) makes very stupid sarcastic comments that are not funny.The story is about a girl witch that needs to go away from home for a year of training. She arrives in a town and decides to start a delivery service, as she can ride her broom well.While I would not recommend it for adults, it is a nice movie to watch with children under 6, with a subtle moral behind it: ""If one tries hard enough, one will discover oneself and be successful in the career of one's choice."""
2,Yikes!,"My goodness! Can you say, BORING? I was enticed by all the rave reviews and saw the movie, but I lived to regret it. Horribly done, the story leaves little to the imagination. My advice, if curiousity drives you mad, see the movie. But if you can, avoid it entirely!"
1,A honest review from a normal person,"I am tired of anime nuts rating everything 5 stars. After seeing Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Princes Monoke, I was a Miyazaki fan. I immediatly bought Kiki's delivery service in hopes of another masterpeice. I was severly disappointed with it . . . enough to be motivated to write this review.Don't waste your time or money on this pointless dull animation. You might enjoy it if you are 3 years old."
3,Damaged box,I love this movie. The reason why i gave it a three is because the outside box was damaged in the corner and the outside box did not look new. The actually movie and case it came in did look new though. The actual movie i am pleased with but if i order something new i expect it to come in good condition. I got the two disc version with special features. If someone orders something new the outer box shouldnt look smashed in the corner. Im a little disappointed with the condition. I dont know if the box got messed up while it was being delivered of if it was like this when they shipped it but im not very happy.
2,Dialogue needlessly cut.,"I have watched the VHS of this movie for years. Finally decided to buy the DVD since our last VHS player seems to be slowly dying. The DVD version only had the original japanese music in places where the VHS had some really cute songs in english that my kids and I love to sing along with. A LOT of dialogue, almost everything said by Phil Hartman, was cut if the camera wasn't on the character showing him speaking. Needless to say I won't be getting rid of my VHS anytime soon, and I'm very dissappointed with Disney for it."
4,Cute Awesome Film!,"This is one of the better versions I've found - they put in a lot of the original music, took out some of Jiji's one-liners, and made the ending more like the original Japanese version. When I first saw this film, Disney had changed the ending to imply that Kiki could once again talk to her cat, but in this version of the film they took it back to the original ending where Kiki has grown beyond talking to Jiji.For the film itself - I have loved this film since I was a kid and I still love it. I think that kids and adults both will find something about this film to love. Great family movie.Hayao Miyazaki's work is also a pleasure. Debbie Reynolds, Phil Hartman (R.I.P.), and Kirsten Dunst all did a fantastic job. It is one of the better dub jobs I've seen. Excellent."
2,Not The Original Version,"After looking all over for our ""original"" version we gave in and bought this version.Started out great and then when Kiki takes off on her broom...the music has been changed.This is such a bummer. Why do they do this. Fortunately the voices are still the same whichis better than the remake of Totoro. I see from another reviewer that some of the dialoguehas been changed in this version of Kiki too. Haven't seen the entire movie yet so can't comment.Is it still sweet and delightful? Yes but use an old quote: ""you can never go home again.""My husband reminds me to always ""read the reviews"" first to see what the scoop is. I shall."
5,A pleasant Miyazaki movie,"A pleasant sojourn through Miyazaki-land. You have your excellent animation, excellent attention to detail, Prisoner of Zenda type Euro-landscape, lack of beginning, lack of an end, lack of a plot. A very typical Miyazaki movie of this period. Beautiful, but empty. Actually beautiful and empty.If you're looking for action or the weirdness of his later films you won't find it here. If you're looking for beautiful animation and scenery and something pleasant for the afternoon, and you are his target audience of a middle school aged Japanese girl it won't get any better than this!"
5,Greatest Japanese animation film ever,"Beautiful pictures, breath-taking animations and heart-warming story"
5,Fantastic,"This movie was great! Definately one of my favorite Japanese animation movies! Wonderful storyline, and cute charecters. This movie talks about growing up, doing your part, making friends, and being a witch (Not a bad witch). All Japanese animation, in my opinion, is beautiful. And one scene can tell an entire story. My cousin owns and loved this movie, too. We used to play KiKi's Delivery Service when we were little. I would HIGHLY recommend this movie!"
4,Kiki,This is a great movie for all ages. It has entertainment on many levels. One of the things my family enjoyed was that witches are treated in a positive light. (A very refreshing change). It also had a good message for girls in being strong and independant. Girls dont' get very many of these role models anywhere.
5,So cute,"This is a sweet, heart-warming loveable coming of age story about a little witch named Kiki, and her cat, Jiji. It's really cute, and the animation is a delight. It has the feel-good, good will quality of other Studio Ghibli films."
4,"I'm a 37 year old man, and still love this movie!","I admit this movie is REALLY cute and intended for a younger audience, but it speaks to the inner child in me. It has a real nice spin on kids gearing up to go be on their own. I was alos surprised (and elated) to hear the late, great Phil Hartman as the voice of GiGi."
5,Wonderful Video,I have looked all around town for this video. My daughter had this one a few years ago but lost it in Hurricane Katrina. It is one of her favorites. The story is charming and it is a first rate production. I recommend it to anyone who likes adventure.
3,Not the same as I grew up with,"I first saw this movie back when Movie Gallery were introducing Anime and when Spirited Away was announced and it had better dialog better music score and more of a childish ""Oh i get it now"" type of theme for kids. Out of all the anime I've ever seen this is the only one next to Totoro that has that Anime can be for kids too type of deal. With this being a special edition DVD they shouldve did 2 different English Dialouge versions. One 1998 version and the 2010 version with Japanese music and English vocals the only reason I think that is because already since I'm more familiar with the 1998 version I dont understand a few things. If I watch this movie with my daughter I will watch the 1998 version with her. Sorry Disney I wish you kept the 1998 one or added that as an extra audio. Stars 3/5 reason: classic film but bad cut vocals. :("
5,An exciting film for all ages,"When enthusiastic young witch Kiki leaves home one full moonlit night to make it on her own, she discovers that more than magic is needed to overcome life's obstacles. Miyazaki has created a wonderful world not that different from our own, wherein lies the movie's appeal. Great characters and voice acting, including the late Phil Hartman as Kiki's cat, make this movie extremely enjoyable and highly recommended. You will root for Kiki all the way.The flying scenes are especially exhilirating. Like much of the movie, these scenes are slow paced so you can enjoy them. As Kiki wends her way high over ocean, countryside, forest, city, you feel as though you are flying with her. My favorite is when she is flying over the city lights at night."
3,Good but different from the original movie.,"KiKi's delivery service is one of my favorite films but this edition of the movie is different from the original. If anyone has seen the older copy of the movie, you will realize a few changes. One, half of Jiji's dialogue has been cut and i was very disappointed with that. The original dialogue really brought Jiji's character to life. Two, the soundtrack is different as well. In the original when kiki was first flying away from home the song was in english called ""Soaring"" (look it up on Youtube it's a really good song). They changed all the english songs to japanese. Third, a lot of the back round track for other animals, and objects are gone too. Overall if you can find an older copy of the movie then buy that one. Not the new edition."
3,"Good, But Not the Same","The first time I watched Kiki's Delivery Service was when it was on VHS about 10 or so years ago and I fell in love with it. It isn't usually on tv so I was so happy that it was on sale on Amazon in DVD format. The story and animation are still great but the audio, especially for Kiki or any of the younger (or female) characters has an odd digital echo like they're talking through a fan. I don't partiuclary care for the fact that they took out the english songs and replaced them with the original japanese ones and I'm also disappointed how they cut a few of Gigi's lines as well as some others. I very much prefer the 1998 version of this but since that is only on VHS and I no longer own a VHS player I'll have to settle with the DVD I purchased. I don't blame Amazon, it came right on time and in perfect condition but I'm disappointed that whoever remanufactured this movie changed so much of the content that made it so fun to watch as a kid."
5,What I think of Kiki's Delivery Service,"Out of all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies, Kiki's Delivery Service is my all time favorite. It's so heartwarming. It's about a young witch named Kiki (DUH!)who turned 13 left home for a year, so she can train to become a good witch. With her is her black cat Gigi, who is always complaining about Kiki not being careful.After arriving, she meets a young man named Tombo (his real name is Kapuri, I think) who seems to like her. She starts working as a delivery girl, at a bakery for a woman named Osono and her husband.Osono is expecting a baby so she really could use Kiki's help. Also she not only let's Kiki work at the bakery, she also let's Kiki live in the attic of their house (which is the upstairs of the bakery). However, after a while, Kiki begins to lose her powers as a witch. Will she get them back? You have to see the movie to find out!"
1,Piece of crap,"This is a big rip-off of the cooking public. Companies should not be allowed to sell such shabby, non-working pieces of junk described as ""The Secret Tool of Professional Chefs""-quote from the box it was in. I would like to tell the people that made this junk where to put it. And I paid [price] plus tax for it."
3,Excellent quality but too small,I got these Chevy floor mats for my 1997 K1500 Z71 x-cab Silverado and I found they are too small. I think they should be 4 inches wider and 8 inches longer to really protect the vehicle mat. Excellent quality but you have to use them in a smaller car. They don't work in the big ones.
4,Red Ink does have merit,"Red Ink based on the Atlanta child murders did not let me down. There is some solid acting and the story plot except for a couple of scenes was very enjoyable. The editor and the reporter relationship was that of a mentor making sure the reporter got the story right. A researcher finds that the police and the coroners office are involved in the plot to murder these children and is murdered before her conscience is too much to bare. Her husband played by Errol Wilks is bereaved and is full of questions opening up a can of worms when visited by the reporter.Too close his life is cut short leaving behind his young son.Of course, good does triumph over evil and the ending is dramatic!I would recommend this movie, keep and open mind..."
4,And you thought your neighbor was weird...,"Nothing can prepare you for some of the crazies that are presented here in this book. Not fiction, oh no... Merely a simple recount of the worst people to be recorded by history, and a couple of the best made up ones as well. Funny, scary, appalling, and tells you that none of the sick bastards we see now are original."
2,Great while it lasted,"The grip is very comfortable and the shovel part is nice and strong. It does the job very well. Even ice cream that is frozen very hard can be served up.The description for this says that it is not recommended for the dishwasher. That is an understatement. I have had two of these. Each time, someone put it in the dishwashers and I only found out when I emptied it. The finish comes off pretty easily. Then it starts to corrode in the drawer between uses.There are other products with the same problem. So, be very careful what you choose.Why would it be designed this way? To make sure it wears out quickly?"
2,Look for better,"This product warrants five stars only on the first use. If you put it in the dishwasher, it starts losing its plating and turns dull. They don't tell you that on the ads or on the product. The cushioned handle is comfortable, but who wants to dip ice cream with a chipping scoop that is hard to use. Look for one that's really stainless steel and that is truly dishwasher safe. Farberware has one but I haven't been able to find one. You're going to pay more, but it will be worth it."
2,Poor Design; Not for Dishwasher,"The metal ""tang"" inside the rubber handle of this spade does not go to the end, so when you are wrenching on the thing to dig out hard ice cream, the rubber at the end will bend in your palm and you cannot get any force applied. Also, the coating on the spade does come off in the dishwasher. There IS a no dishwashing warning on it, but the point is that that is very inconvenient."
1,Waste of $,"I wish I'd read these reviews. Previous OXO products have been of high quality, but not this. OXO should place a warning sticker that this is not dishwasher safe. Washed in the dishwasher once and it came out ruined- the ""chrome"" coating was gone and the metal pitted. I have I high-end Bosch, so I know it's not a dishwasher issue, rather CPS- Cheap Piece of ****."
1,Really bad product,"I bought this ice cream spade, washed it once, then used it once. It then turned black in the dishwasher! I have a Bosch dishwasher and used Cascade, so it isn't the dishwashers fault. I certainly did not expect a black, powdering coating to show up after using this once! This is the wrong product to buy if you expect to put it in the dishwasher."
5,Great product,Cuts throughy cold ice cream like nothing else I have ever tried! Handle is really nonslip so hands stay out of the ice cream.
2,Won't Buy Again,"The men in our family love these. That's why I purchased four. My problem with them is that they CANNOT be put through the dishwasher. Therefor, they must be hand washed and of course, that's left to the women. Once these have been in the dishwasher they began to loose the plating."
5,Accent on Achievement: Book 1 CD,"Just what I wanted for my daughter. I was afraid I would have to order it from the Music store 20 miles away then go pick it up for double the price but I found it here, paid a lot less and it was delivered within a week! Wonderful!"
4,Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is terrific!,"What a surprise to discover that this fine actress is also a TERRIFIC singer. The soundtrack is suitably moody, and MEM's sweet, smokey voice accurately captures the inner monologue of a woman who's lived ""her way"" -- older & wiser, no apologies & no regrets (well, maybe just a few <g>)."
3,Usable as stand magnifier only,"The photo may lead customers to assume that this product can be used as a hand-held magnifier. it can't; it is truly a stand magnifier. In other words, it must lie flat on the surface you're trying to magnify. The part that looks like a handle is just a large battery compartment (you'll need two C batteries). This magnifier requires battery-charged illumination because there's no other way sufficient light can reach what you're trying to magnify. That's why I was so disappointed when, after only a half dozen uses, the little bulb burned out, rendering the magnifier useless. I still think it deserves 3 stars because, when its bulb worked, it offered a large degree of magnification without distortion."
4,Not for regular sized staplers,"This is a good product, but is not the type of staples you want if you have a regular sized stapler. I bought these staples, but had to give them away to someone who had a big industrial sized stapler."
4,Weak on Nutrition; Strong on Workout How To,"This is the most comprehensive workout/fitness trainer the I have seen. Complete with color pictures accompanied by written step by step instruction then catagorized by muscle group, this book is perfect for all levels of training ability. Frank's explanation is thorough and even the beginner will be able to preform the exercises. The only thing that is truly lacking is the chapter on nutrition. If a 200 pound woman tried to eat all of the protien, carbs and fat that this book recommends, she would never lose weight. All in all this is great book for training...find another book for nutrition."
2,WHERE IS THE LEWIS VS BRIGGS FIGHT ?,"ON THE COVER IS LEWIS VS BRIGGS,UNLESS I MISSED SOMETHING IT'S NOT ON THE DVD? THE DVD IS ALL FIGHTS OF FIGHTERS FROM EUROPE AS FOR LEWIS AND HAMED IT WAS THEIR FIRST COUPLE OF FIGHTS AS A PRO AND DEFINITELY NOT THEIR BEST KNOCK OUTS.THIS DVD IS ONLY FIGHTS FROM ONE PROMOTER IN EUROPE,UNLESS YOU'RE A DEVOTED FIGHT FAN OF EUROPEAN FIGHTERS YOU MAY BE DISAPPOINTED.THERE ARE DECENT KNOCK OUTS BUT I DONT RECOGNIZE THE FIGHTERS.DONT LET THE COVER THROW YOU A CURVE IT'S NOT WHAT IT APPEARS."
1,Insufficient focus and detail.,"Absolutely without a doubt the best thing about Teitler's `Taming and Training Cockatiels' is the wonderful color photographs, but aren't most color photographs of cockatiels charming? Decent photographs are insufficient criteria to distinguish a book on birds. The book is written in a boring style that reads like, `look, here are my pets, aren't they great?' The book lacks focus and unsuccessfully attempts to cover too much material. There are promising introductory sections intended for readers that have never owned a bird before where instructions on making `first contact' without terrorizing the cockatiel are given. However, just a few pages later there is a large section on breeding birds. Surely it's unwise for a novice who wants a tame, loveable pet bird to delve into breeding at the same time? If the author had focused on one area, such as a guidebook for the new bird owner while avoided irrelevant distractions, I might have been able to suggest this book."
3,Uneven at times but enjoyable,Overall I enjoyed the book but at times The Icarus Girl feels a little uneven. I wish most of the book had taken place in Nigeria. The Icarus Girl is much more mystical and mysterious in Nigeria while being tilted to horror when the family goes back to England. The book seemed to lose some steam when it did.
2,the icarus girl,"enjoyed the first half of this novel, the second half deteriorated steadily into a pretentious and unintelligible mix of ghost story and nigerian myth. disappointing!"
4,The Icarus Girl,"A very compelling story, it kept me reading on to find out what Next??? The thoughts from the young girl's point of view were very interesting and illustrated how different are the minds of adults and children. I would totally recommend this book."
2,One of the most boring books I've ever read.,"I was SO unimpressed with this novel but drawn to it by the summary. I loved, at first, the idea of some of it taking place in Nigeria, with the idea of a troubled girl, with the question of whether the girl's friend was real or a spirit or her imagination.But that's where my intrigue ended because almost as soon as I started reading, it became apparent that the characters other than the protagonist herself were one-dimensional and boring. They were flat and unbelievable and lent absolutely nothing to the story itself.As I read, I found myself confused by what was happening and why, found myself doubting characters' actions, and felt absolutely unmoved by what the climax was supposed to be. I know I'm no big critic, but this story while it had good intentions, wasn't planned well and ended up having a lot of loose ends. I definitely do not recommend this book."
2,"emotionally gripping, but ultimately disappointing","I was really hopeful as I started to read this book, because I found that I cared about Jess and her family. If the goal of the author was to be completely creepy, she definitely met that goal - I had nightmares all night upon completing the book (and I'm not easily scared). The writing was very good, especially as regards developing characters, but the story was uneven and a bit wandering at times. I was left with several unanswered questions (and not the good kind, where you are OK with not having enough information). I will be giving this book to Goodwill, but I would not be opposed to reading another effort by this author, who clearly has potential..."
1,Dont Work on my 325i,"I put all the correct especification of my BMW 325i 2003 on the "" Amazon Garage "" and that recomends this filter, but this filter dont work for my vehicle. Bad bad of Amazon."
3,Not as good as Tour De Beats CD.,"Im a big fan of Tony Moran, usually, but this album was sort of a let down compared to his other stuff. A few good songs, but like the other review says, theres a lot of filler on here."
1,THREE STRIKES....YOU'RE OUT !,"This book lacks it all....depth, character development, writing style, creativity, and did not hold my interest past page one. The author(s) have a done a poor job (again). A definite non-read!"
2,Overly contrived plot,"Not only was the plot overly contrived but there was no character development, no development at all. As a result, it was difficult to feel anything for the main character. The novel was poorly written and edited as well. There were gaps of logic which raised more questions than the authors answered. It seemed like the novel was hastily put together from an outline and nothing was added to expand the outline."
2,What happened to good writing?,"I can't believe that these two authors wrote the first two books in this series. They were great! This third book just plods slowly along with an uninteresting plotline, vapid characters and a pretty boring conclusion. The main character, John the Eunuch, has lost his you-know-whats...the authors seem to have lost their ability to write a good mystery!"
2,dreary,"A dreary, depressing tale with no redeeming aspects. The characters are poorly drawn with the most unrealistic child figure since Macbeth's son (Shakespeare). A sad, sad story poorly written. The other two are so much better."
1,Very poor picture quality,Dvd is almost unwatchable.Vhs tape looks a lot better than this dvd. Very poor picture quality taken from old vhs tape
1,Funeral Home Dvd,"Do not order this DVD, I repeat, Do not order this DVD. The quality is AWEFUL. Packaging is nice but nothing else about it is......HORRIBLE VHS transfer"
1,OBSCENELY BAD 2012 TRANSFER FROM CFS,"The few charms of this 1979 regional horror film (shot in rural Canada) by talented schlockmeister Bill Fruet are totally undermined by THE worst presentation of any commercially released title I have ever seen... EVER! Not only is it taken from a VHS tape, it looks like it was from a blurry, smeared, sludgy, ghost-ridden third-generation copy. I paid six bucks for this and it can't even be donated to a thrift store-- I just couldn't foist it on any unlucky retro-horror fan. SO it went right into the trashcan. Amazon should pull this from sale and refuse to do business with this rip-off outfit. Times are too tough and technology too advanced for this to even be remotely acceptable. Take a clue from Blue Underground, Synapse or Code Red and treat these movies with a little respect!"
3,"Yes, it's true...",This DVD version (CFS RELEASING - ASIN: B006OT0T6G) is very difficult to watch due to bad transfer to DVD format... I guess I had to see for myself.
1,Horrible DVD,"I am an avid horror movie fan. I saw the trailer for this on youtube and thought i'd get it. I read the reviews on here that talked about the bad quality of the DVD. Me being a fan of the 70s horror movies that sort of gem comes with a price of poorer quality more so than films now. I figured it couldn't be that bad. The quality is just horrible, it's not even watchable. I don't know what the other releases look like but they got to be better than this."
3,Bonnie Prince Charlie rides again,"I read this when I was about 15. It is a brief historical novel about the Jacobites. I enjoyed it, but of course it doesn't compare to Sir Walter Scott's Waverley. What I didn't know at the time was that Chidsey had written a biography of Bonnie Prince Charlie thirty years earlier."
4,More accounts of U.S. terrorism in the world,"I'm glad to see yet one more accurate account of how far an almost imperceptible percentage of this country's population is willing to go in the name of their interests. It's really sad that those who should be most interested in this, namely U.S. citizens, turn a blind eye to it. But as it has been proven throughout centuries of history, silent propaganda, coupled with loud lies told by the rest of the press, works really well at keeping the population in a different galaxy. Otherwise, they would not allow these things to happen.Poor education must have something to do with this phenomenon, as illustrated by the disastrous spelling and grammar in some of the negative reviews coming from U.S. locations above."
3,Does not last long,"I bought this item for my 7 year old son. This item is very cute and grew quickly, but the grass did not last long once winter set in. And this was despite following all the directions and having it in a south facing window. I also think given their very small size, the price is too high."
2,Disappointing,"Too much fluff! This video is deceiving. I do not like to turn on an exercise video and watch 20 minutes of ad campaigns, testimonials, and other filler. I've already purchased the tape; I don't need to be convinced of how GREAT IT IS. The exercise portion would be more effective if it were not constantly interrupted by wrestling footage and camera art. When I'm ready to exercise, I'M READY TO EXERCISE! The nonessential footage should have been reserved for the end of the tape --after the workout-- for the wrestling fans, which I AM NOT, and the ads.......bad idea. Come on, Chyna, you can do better than that! Just getting through the junk is exhausting! When Chyna can produce a REAL workout video from start to finish, I will be the first in line. This tape is very deceptive, and I don't appreciate being taken. Lori LaPerle (serious about fitness)"
5,The Best Exercise Video of All Time!,"Chyna fitness is without a doubt one of the best exercise videos I have ever seen. After doing the exercise only 2 times, I can see and feel the results. The video is very easy to follow, as Chyna (Joanie) helps guide you throughout the entire routine. The only thing you need are 3 sets of weights (dumbells) heavy, medium, and light, a bench or chair, and a jump rope. I didn't have 3 sets of weights, I only had one, so I used that set throughout the entire video. I didn't have a jump rope either, but it says on the video that it's okay to pretend. It serves the same purpose. I would recommend this video to any person looking to better themselves and their body, especially beginners. 5 stars for this one!"
5,BEST VIDEO OUT THERE,This is a great in depth look at the frog malformation phenomenon and unfortunately one of the the only ones out there. I am preparing a feature film around this subject matter and this video presentation was very helpful.
3,Oh no,"I have this on vhs and wanted to get it on dvd. I am happy but it's a different voice over edition than the one I already own, and have loved since I was a child. It's still a good movie but it's going to take time for this version to grow on me."
5,A great book.,This is a great book for anyone who is a Disny fan. I highly recomend this book to read. Gives all of the locations of the Hidden Mickeys around the park (Disneyland).
2,Same Old Same Old,"There was nothing in this book that I really didn't really already know. It was good, don't get me wrong, but not the best book for those that already have a pretty good knowledge of Disneyland History. For someone that has never been there, it would be a great start."
5,For the Disney kid in us all,"Kendra has done a magical job. With Disneyland Detective in hand, exploring Walt's original Magic Kingdom becomes a brand new, interactive adventure--for even the most seasoned visitor. I can't thank her enough for telling so many little known stories about the people who helped Walt create this dream-come-true-park and the places that ""plus"" the vision.In this fabulous 50th anniversary year, don't miss finding out the secrets that make Disneyland USA the grand-daddy of all theme parks."
3,"Entertaining, but poorly proofread...is it accurate?","My kids and I enjoyed reading this book while on vacation to Disneyland last week, especially looking for the hidden Mickeys. Nevertheless, the poor proofreading with many spelling and grammatical errors made me wonder: If the author/editor/publisher can't even publish a book that's proofread accurately, how can the reader trust the accuracy of the stories, anecdotes and ""facts"" in this book? The author even thanks the editor in the introduction!Nevertheless, the price is right, and with the above caveats, I can recommend this book as a fun supplement to a Disneyland vacation."
2,Needs to be proofread.,"I LOVE books about Disneyland. I read them frequently. I was especially excited when this book came out. However, as others have noted in their reviews, this book contains NUMEROUS factual and grammatical mistakes. While this book contains a lot of good, interesting information, much of it has been duplicated in other works on the subject and, furthermore, I question the accuracy of the information contained in the book due to the other errors. However, it is worth noting that from a design standpoint, this book is laid out in a rather attractive manner. Overall, I must say that I was dissapointed."
2,"...and then, the Gods created Spell Check!","I love Disneyland lore, legends, facts, fiction, even rumor. Thus, it's easy for me to delve into a tome which will dabble in some, if not all of the above. As other reviewers have noted, some of the tidbits of information in this book are terrific fun. But, alas, my wife is due some sleep as she was awakened by my frequent, ""ARRRGH"", ""OH! MY GOD!"", and ""WHO EDITED THIS?!""I suppose, Dear Reader, you're getting the point; the writer may have the research down, but needs to exercise her editing and spelling chops. I believe there is some manner of a ""...for Dummies"" book that may help, tho im not shur wich won."
5,Loved it!,"We took this book w/ us to Disneyland and found it very useful. While there, we took the ""Walk in Walt's footsteps"" tour and found that it covered a lot of what was in the book. One of the tour guides even commented on what a good book this one is. The only downfall is that we couldn't find many of the Hidden Mickeys. We were told by a cast memeber that Disneyland doesn't have official Hidden Mickeys and that if there is one on one day, it might be gone the next. We still had fun looking for them!"
1,Don't Buy This Product,This product only worked one time for about 10 minutes then would not work again . Tech support was nonexistant . Don't waste your money.
5,Great!!!,I gave my sister this as a gift and she absolutely loves it. Many of the recipes do not require the use of a scone pan so one does not have to make this additional purchase. The recipes are also very easy to follow and contain ingredients that many people already have on hand in their cupboard. A must for anyone who wants to start to bake and enjoy the delight of scones....
5,Used this book for at least 10 years.,"I have used ""Simply Scones"" for at least 10 years. I had a B&B; in New Hampshire and the guest preferred scones to muffins or coffeecake. I always made them smaller (dividing the dough into more sections and cutting them in eights) as the larger scones went to waste. You can get at least 24 out of a recipe with three disks cut into eights. My favorite is the ""Apricot, White Chocolate, and Walnut Scones"". I use this recipe as a base and add other fruits and flavorings. No matter where I take these scones I get asked for the recipe. I have recommened this book countless times over the years.The scones freeze well before baking (and after) and I usually make them the night before and put them in the refrigerator then bake in the morning. Frozen scones bake well after sitting out about a half hour before baking. I have been happy with every recipe I tried. Also have the muffin book by the same authors. That is very good as well."
5,Simply Scones,If you want to bake the best scones ever you will purchase this cook book. Everyone that eats them wants the recipe. I have baked these in Scotland and even my Scottish friends that have baking and eating scones forever want the recipe. Can't go wrong!
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"Every recipe I have tried from this cookbook has been fantastic. There are some wonderful combinations such as orange and chocolate scones. The directions are easy, the ingredients are usually common items that are easy to find and all the recipes I have tried turned out yummy.Although it is a small book, in size, it is not small in yumminess or easiness. I have to admit that scones have become a staple in our house, due in a large part, to this book.Enjoy."
5,I really have enjoyed the book. The recipes are GREAT!,"One of the things I liked about the book was that there is a recipe for ""Clotted Cream"" which I haven't found in any of the other recipe books I have read. There is quite a variety of recipes for spreads in addition to scones for every occasion and taste! The book is well worth having in your collection!"
1,Packs a big disappointment for such a tiny book,"The back cover was alluring with its promise of ""more than seventy luscious recipes."" I found the recipes to be standard fare. No fewer than eight recipes featured chocolate. While I'm a chocolate fiend myself, that's a very high percentage for such a small cookbook. I've found better recipes on online cooking sites."
1,"Not totally useless, but close. The good reviews had to be written by friends. Wouldn't recommend this book!","Simply Scones, is simply useless. I quite agree with the comments from two other owners of this book in that I was ""SHOCKED"" essentially at small the size and poor quality of this book. Obviously put out by a couple of food editors not actually someone that bakes or cooks. Even the line drawings on some pages were irrelevant and uselessly repeated. As small as this book is it amazingly had a lot of white space. I feel completely ripped off on the purchase of this book. If I bought this book at a garage sale for 25 cents I would feel that was a good deal for this book. I really could go on and rip this book apart even more and probably filling up more pages then the recipes actually take up, but I'll stop here. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this book or any others by these ""authors."""
3,Teeny tiny cookbook,"This book does cover a lot about scones in many forms and flavors, however buyers may not realize that it's just a tiny little thing with no photos other than the cover. I nearly flipped when I found the same book on ebay for 99 cents and only a couple of dollars postage! As such, I think it's about double the price that it should be, so buyers beware. If you are a scone devotee, you may find it well worth it...or you might try a search on ebay and see if you get lucky like I did, but BEFORE you order a new copy. My Amazon copy is going to be a Christmas gift to someone else...and I'll console myself by averaging out the prices of both!"
3,Anything but Simple,"This book is titled Simply Scones, but it is anything but simple. All the recipes are insanely hard. Use 2-3 bowls for one recipe. Some of the ingredients needed are hard to find if not impossible. It is NOT quick and easy. Even at its insanely cheap price that I purchased it for I do not recommend it to anyone who wants to make a quick scone."
2,Sent this off to the library book sale,"I personally didn't care for the book as a whole, though some of the recipies were fine. I would make different scones using this book and they would still be left over three days later- with 3 kids that says something. Perhaps I am just a purist at heart- give me a currant scone any day!"
2,SMALL BOOK -- fits in palm of your hand,"I am giving this two stars without ever trying the recipes because I think the price is a bit high for a book that is about the size of your hand. Hope the recipes make it worth it. Plus, it'll be an easy one to loose on a bookshelf. Pretty cover, nice idea, too small."
2,More Novelty Book Than Recipe Book,"I bought this as a gift to go along with a Nordicware Scone pan. I kick myself for not reading the specs of the book's size. This is more of a novelty gift, something cute and fun. If you are a baker, a recipe book of a common size will be more useful in the kitchen. This smaller book is not very functional.I haven't decided if I'll send this back. There is nothing wrong with it, it's just not what I'd hoped for. I don't want a small little stocking stuffer sized book that will get lost among the other cookbooks in the kitchen. I wanted something usable, easy to read and of an average size. A real receipt book that can be left open while whipping up a batch of scones."
3,I should have done a bit more looking,"The reviewer who said ""more like a novelty book"" is correct. I was surprised at the size (5.5"" x 5.5"") and then at the slimness (3/8"") and 128 pages ... but then I looked further and found that the first handful of pages are generic (measurements and the like)and the last several chapters are about ""tea"" (proper) and sauces. With the small form factor I then became suspicious of the actual number of recipes - so I counted them. 51. True - the title says ""70 ... Scones and Spreads"". Many pages have 3-5 lines of text and a generic drawing - filler.So, although I anticipate that the recipes will be workable if not outstanding, I am dissatisfied with the package as a whole. $9.95 is on the high end for a small form book with limited pages and recipes. I think it might be worth $4.95 - $5.95 at most. Many recipes can be found online.I'll keep it but will be certainly doing more research before buying another cute cook book."
1,gentle sound pattern?,"This product was not what it claimed to be! There was no gentle sound pattern. it was a regular alarm sound. Also it came in 3 colors, according to the pictures, but there was no option to chose a color. What a rip off!"
1,It is useless to me,The volume of alarm was very very low that I could not hear when sleeping. I am awakened easily always but I had not waken up for couple times after using this alarm clock. I no longer to use this alarm clock as don't want to make me late.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"The multi day alarm settings are alright, but the alarm itself is not loud enough even at the highest setting. The gentle sound pattern is a little too gentle."
3,great idea but doesn't stand,"the idea of this alarm is really great & unique. i always wanted some thing that i don't have to cancel it's alarms by the weekend (or suffer the consequences in a weekend morning)& then redo it after the weekend.the thing is, it almost doesn't stand so if i want to know the time i have to search for it & actually hold it."
2,"Cheap, especially the snooze button","3 alarms are what initially attracted me. I was surprised by the generally flimsy construction. The snooze switch is a disaster. As noted elsewhere, you have to hit it twice quickly to turn the alarm off. The switch on my clock didn't make reliable contact. Sometimes I'd push it so hard I thought it was going to break, but it was still obviously not making electrical contact, since the alarm kept coming back on. No option to keep the display on all the time is a big minus, too."
2,So So digital alarm clock,"Has ""weekday"", ""saturday"", ""sunday"" alarms.Snooze/turn off alarm located on top rarely functions/works...:-(Found out on the internet, you can simply double click the ""weekday"", ""saturday"", ""sunday"" buttons and it works!Not good for snooze alarm...won't shut off, keeps beeping until the batteries are dead!"
3,"Good idea, but flawed product.","Love the three alarm settings. I use the alarm M-F and Sunday (Saturday is turned off). I like that I don't have the set the alarm each night - it's always ready to go. I also like that daylight savings time is automatically handled.I don't like the double-click necessary to turn off the alarm. There is no indicator letting you know that the alarm is off and not in snooze mode instead. A few times I've double tapped then left the room only to have my wife yelling a few minutes later that the alarm was still going off (oops, still in snooze mode).Edited 5-26-2009Clock is not so good anymore.Gains about 5 minutes every 3 months and I have to reset the time. And now the backlight is not working anymore."
2,not impressed,"After reading all of the wonderful reviews that other people have written, i thought this would be the perfect alarm clock for me. I got it, and i wasn't impressed. It doesn't come with directions, so you have to figure it out on your own. It seems to be made very cheaply, and it looks worse in person than the picture shows. Oh and when you order it, you can't choose what color you want. It's hard to get it to stand up like its supposed to, the slightest little bump will make it fall down onto its back. The problem with that, is when it falls onto its back, it covers the speaker and you can't hear it go off! One tiny bump and poof! i'm late for work...yes, it happened. I would not recommend it."
2,Can't turn it off!,"I liked the idea of a small alarm clock. Setting different alarms for weekdays and weekend appealed to me, too. The sound of the alarm - to me at least - is rather annoying and there's no option for something nicer. But what made me replace the clock was that it kept coming back on! The snooze and the turn-off are only a few second apart: if you don't hit the button twice fast enough, you're in snooze mode! Short of removing the batteries, there is no way to turn the alarm off until it comes on again. Very annoying!"
1,Not Worth The Postage,"ZERO STARS! If this item were free, it would still be a waste of postage! It is difficult to read/see. It will not waken any but the VERY lightest sleeper - the alarm can hardly be heard!"
1,Did not work.,Very very cheap. Did not work. Half the display was blank. Seemed like a $1 store item.
3,Noel addresses the most fundamental issue in shamanism.,"The book is a serious attempt to strengthen the connection between imaginal psychology and shamanism. But if we wish to strengthen the practice of what Noel calls an ""authentic western shamanism,"" he leads us in exactly the opposite direction from which we should go. It is presumptuous of Noel to suggest that Merlin should be some kind of spiritual figure for us. He has missed the whole point of universal, organic shamanism. He claims to teach it. More likely he teaches about it. The best point in the book is Noel's thought that we must stop fantasizing about native shamans."
4,great resource,"I am a public health nurse and teach health and nutrition courses to parents. This book is a constant resource for me. It is easy to follow and full of useful tables, growth charts, etc. I have found this to be one of the most practical books in my library"
1,"They cannot sing for anything, dancing is good though","I saw them in concert the other day, and i must admit, these three guys have great dancing talents, but they cannot sing for anything, the cd sounds DECENT, i guess, but that is with tons of editing, so when they sang live, my goodness it was brutal."
5,GREAT ALBUM!,I used to own this cd a long time ago and it was stolen. This cd is the best one out of the 2 that they have out. I am so very glad I was able to find it again and order it. I recommend that you get this album becasue it is a MUST HAVE!
4,Interesting Historical Account,"Tafel's account offers an interesting look at the role of a young architect serving under Frank Lloyd Wright. A talented individual in his own right, Tafel is occasionally too deferential to his Master, but then people were more respectful in that era. Many photographs, including documentary pictures from the studio and of construction projects in progress flesh out this useful study. What is most interesting is the look at a comprehensive training and site experience that is sadly lacking in the education of young architects today."
2,This book does not make sense!!,"This book was very poorly written. It goes back and forth between a vampire girl and a regular guy, and there difference. Her vampires do not match the vampires of ""today"". There is no story here."
5,Excelent book.,"This book contains not only the sheet music of most of the best Dire Straits songs, it contains comments from Mark Knopfer himself about music that puts us on a thinking about the career of an artist."
2,"""quite"" trivial","This is the first of Noel Coward's plays I have listened to, and I was ""quite"" unimpressed. The script IS sometimes witty to be sure, and all actors did a marvelous job, but overall the story is ""quite"" trivial, and the dialog sounds like an imitation of Oscar Wilde, but without his depth, and with much much much less sense of humor. Overall, ""quite"" disappointing. Four-five truly witty jokes and a lot of ""quite""s do not ""quite"" make the trick. All the LA Theater productions of Wilde's plays are ""quite"", no, actually VASTLY superior."
3,Witty But Shallow,"This is often regarded as Coward's best play. Supposedly written as a vehicle for Coward and his friend, the great Gertrude Lawrence, it displays the wit and stagecraft which made Coward famous. As a serious work, however, it is limited. It is clear that Coward was aiming to investigate the irrational nature of love, sort of a modern day Twelfth Night. Coward's plot and characters are not able to sustain this burden. Even when performed by excellent actors in first rate productions, it still comes across as a skillful farce and not much more."
1,terrible book,I have stayed at monasteries in Europe so was very excited tp purchase this book~~~~such a disappointment.save your money!!poorly written!does not give clear info on the lodging....the photos are of very poor qualitiy....there should be at least one map in the book to help the reader see the locations of the townsoverall....a great idea for a book....it just does not deliver.sorry i bought this.
5,"Tuscany by day, Monastery by night","My wife and I took our bicycles to Tuscany for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We spend such little time in our rooms when we travel, but we like to be centrally located when we bike into town. The monasteries, besides for their beauty, cleanliness, and hospitality, were in the heart of where we wanted to be. One on the nicest things about this book is the inclusion of a letter (translated into Italian and English for you) for you to fax or mail to make reservations (a must if you have biked 35 miles that day and do not want to find the inn is full!!) The letter worked perfectly and we always had a reservation, a smiling face, and a clean room waiting for us at the end of our daily ride!! Use this book and you will have an adventure!!"
1,terrible directions! innacurate! embarrassing marketing ploy,"I paid 22.95 for this bugger, and would love to have my money back. The the directions to the ""Monasteries"" are awful. For example directions from Termini station in Rome to a specific monestary states ""take metro and get off atPiazza Barberini"" ( might be a good idea to let those unfamiliar with Rome know WHAT LINE THEY SHOULD USE! and where the Monastery is after you exit the metro. this example typifies the type of directions that are provided. Mrs. Barish have you ever taken a bus or a subway? Here is another example of directions provided, ""get off at Firenze Santa Maria Novella and then take bus #14"" Bus # 14? to where? how far? This book has absolutely NO MAPS so be prepared to dig. Locations described as ""centrally"" located are actually (when and if you find them with your own map work)often on city outskirts.Very lazy Mrs. Barish. Any one thinking about buying this one should definately save their money."
3,Useful,"This book is useful. We stayed in several guest houses in the book as we drove in northern Italy. I would recommend it but would also make three observations. First, some of the directions are not suffieiently detailed or clear. I think this is a significant weakness of the book. We spent quite a bit of time finding some of the guest houses. Second, understandably, some of the prices are out of date but the places still are bargains. Third, in some of those where we stayed, the people did not speak English. This was not a problem as out Italian is marginally passable but don't expect English to be spoken at all of them, especially on the phone. Nevertheless, I have recommended it to several friends who plan to go to Italy and I will get the latest edition when we go again. It is an investment because the rates are much better than hotels."
3,Great for Beginners,"This video was easy for me, so I'm only giving it 3 stars. The aerobic segments are short and very easy to follow, so this is great for someone who can't yet make it for 20 minutes in a row. The toning is done with an exertube, and not many repetitions, so I didn't feel this part since I work out with weights between 3-4 times per week. Also, good for someone who wants to tone up, but does not want to invest in weights just yet."
5,Love the Ditty Bops?,"If you love that darling duo seemingly teleported from the 1930s (either through Grey's Anatomy or not), check out this CD full of early Boswell Sisters recordings. Quick tempo shifts, inventive three part harmonies highlight this unique trio from yesteryear."
1,NO GOOD!,"I bought this coffee filter at my local grocery store because it was the only cone one they had. I should have waited until my next trip to Walmart. This filter doesn't fit correctly in the filter holder. It isn't a true cone shaped. The first and only time I used it. It melted a little and the coffee leaked into the coffee carafe. Horrible experience. I paid $2.50 for this filter which was too much since it didn't work properly. Trying to save money isn't really saving if the item doesn't work. I urge you not to buy this coffee filter or anything that looks similar. There are others out there that look like this one, so be careful."
5,Challenging and fun,"A lot like Sierra's ""Pharaoh"", this is a challenging and entertaining city-building game. I thought at first that the introduction of interactive gods would be, well, a little silly, but it works fine and actually adds a new dimension to the game. I might wish for a few more scenarios, since I'm sure to go through them all fairly quickly; perhaps there will be an expansion like ""Pharaoh""'s ""Cleopatra"". Addictive fun."
4,So addictive!,"I'm really an action game guy at heart with a little RPG/MMORG and adventure game mixed in. But ever since I played Caesar 3, I've been hooked on this series of games (Caesar 3, Pharoahs, and now Zeus). It's a great game to play on a long airplane ride; it's a great ""thinking man's game (or woman)"".Zeus is the most refined of the series and best overall although I didn't like the cartoon-y aspect of the artwork in this game. I really loved the Rome setting and the more matter-of-fact style of artwork in Caesar 3, but that's probably more a personal preference than anything.I think the only tiny gripe I've had with this game and it's predecessors is that the levels still get kinda repetitive after awhile. But overall, it's one of my favorite games, and really offers some intellectual stimulation and puzzle solving."
4,Sweet,"I had a friend who had this game a few years back , I found it on Amazon cheap and I had to get it. I got the game in 2 days! I still like playing it."
2,Zeus Gods Gods Gods,"I have played Ceasar II & III, Phar/Cleopatra and loved them. Zeus was changed too much. In Ceasar etc. I was the primary God. I also found the editor very complicated. My feeling is that it was written for Game writers. I play for fun. The only thing I liked about Zeus was the interaction with other cities."
3,Disappointment Abounds,"After being such a fan of other Impression games, i.e., Pharoah, Cleopatra, Ceasar 3, Lord of the Realms, I found this game to be very confusing to play. Yes the animations of the God's was an improvement, however, the buildings,etc. do not seem life like as with Pharoah. The animations seem childish to me. I was looking for a more historical type game."
1,DONT BUY THIS GAME,"This is an okay game. There is one problem. Whenever i get going and have a good economy something catched on fire or a plague comes about or another city state just so happens to come to conqour your city. Also the amount of game time it takes to build a full function city is to long. Also it takes to long to build things. For example i was building an Ares Stronghold ( 9 marble ) but in total adds up to about 24 marble, 48 wood and over 5000 dollors. it takes something that should be easy to build and makes it 15- 20 min. If you have alot of time on your hands and alot of patience you might like this game but if you dont buy Stronghold or Age of Empires. I hope this was helpful to you."
5,A great city-building game,"If you liked all the Sim City games and especially if you liked Sierra's Caesar 3, you would most likely like this game. It is very similar to Caesar 3 in the way you play the game, but it is newer, so it has more features. It's sort of like Sim City meets Age of Empires. You can get attacked by various mythological monsters in the middle of trying to develop your Greek polis. I love all the Sierra city-building games. They are all just different enough to be individually enjoyable, but I really love them all."
5,Addictive,"I played through all of the episodes about a year ago, and recently loaded it up again, and it's just as much fun as it was the first time! It's fascinating to watch the city grow, and click on the people and hear what they have to say! Some of their comments are hilarious.I enjoyed this much more than other sim games I had tried, because the people had comments, and there are attainable goals to accomplish. The goals get harder as the game progresses, but they are all attainable, so there is never the frustration of not being able to finish a level. (Only sometimes the frustration of waiting for something to happen, such as a population goal.)"
5,"Zeus, Master of Olympus","I have been playing Zeus for many years, and completely enjoy it. This was a replacement disc. I have the Poseidon upgrade, and love it also.Zeus: Master of Olympus"
1,Chav rock rubbish,"Little wonder no one has yet got around to reviewing this album. The songs are badly written and arranged, Preston's singing is toe curling, and the ""musicianship"" is something I'd expect from a dodgy pub band. While they like to pilfer ideas from great bands of the past, they don't have the wit or intelligence to add anything worthwhile of their own. In a word, Ordinary Boys are embarrassing."
5,I use this over and over,I love this book and I have used it over and over for years. Who cares if it doesn't match blueprints? Simply measure your room and do the math. I don't have blueprints to try and match - I'm just a woman trying to redo rooms in a house. There are 215 punch out pieces of furniture and if they don't fit your EXACT sofa you can cut them down to size.I am a perfectionist and need everything to be measured exact. I do not cut corners and I have used this book for at least 5 complete room makeovers. It has been invaluable and many furniture pieces were NOT purchased because I knew they wouldn't fit in the room - all thanks to this really inexpensive layout kit. $5? It's worth the investment many times over.
1,Room and Furniture Layout Kit,"Unfortunately, the pieces in this book are not to the scale of our blueprints. They should be 1/4"" = 1 ft. however they are 1/2"" = 1 ft. It is not specified in the ordering information on this item."
3,Do the trick,These are a good scale for the 3-D Home kit. It can be a great visual for the home floorplan
1,bulky,"i was moving and thought this item would be helpful .... but, it was too bulky .... not ez to use ...... consequently this item turned up in the waste bin"
2,You might as well just buy a piece of graph paper.,"You get pretty much what you see on the cover...a couple pieces of graph paper with some shapes labeled Couch, Bed, TV.... If your spending more than a few dollars for this, then you're getting ripped off. You might as well buy some graph paper and draw on it."
3,Room layout kit,The product suits my purposes. I am doing some redecorating and purchasing new furniture. layouts are helping me make decisions as to how items will look in room.
4,Excellent information!,I found this book by mistake and sure am glad that I did. What a find. Use the information here and your house will look like a professional did it!
2,scale was crazy,"Tossed it in the garbage . Scale was 1/2"" to the foot, most house drawings are 1/4"" to the foot. Should have been indicated in the sales blurb. Worthless..."
1,Product failed within 3 days,"I have used this pump in the past with great success to aerate a small water feature. They last for years. This one failed within 3 days. Amazon took it back and processed a refund very quickly. No complaints with their service. Called the Manufacturer tech dept and they recommended a different pump for my application which I purchased and installed. Note to prospective buyers. Little Giant makes two pumps which are identical save for one is black and one is blue green. The only difference in the pump is color, and the black pump costs $20 more."
4,Powerful pump,"I bought this to empty the pool cover and it works great. It has a lot of power. Not pretty, but easy to handle and clean up."
5,Always and Forever,I love all of Berverly Jenkins' work. I am only writing to say that the review's that I have read on Amazon refer to another book. I'm not sure what the mix up could be. But at least the first two are not in reference to Always and Forever by Beverly Jenkins. I am more interested in African American History than romance. The research and references behind her work are second to none!!!! The way she weaves a tale of romance is good too.
1,Biography?,"I really think it takes a lot of guts to call a one-page bibliography with a paragraph on the author a ""biography"". Charging $10 for information that I could have easily gotten with a five-minute Google search is stealing. I'm very disappointed and think it was ridiculous to suggest this was anything at all worth the $10!!"
2,I only got 1- not the 25 promised. And no receipt in the box!,"In the description it says 25 pieces will be sent, I got ONE. One card holder. That's it...nothing else, no receipt...nada. So $12 for 1 card holder...I will send a message to the seller and see if they make it right, but I'm not very happy as of now...****UPDATE****I called amazon customer service- they were very nice and are refunding my money. She said she would look into it and try to fix the problem so it won't happen to other people. So thank you amazon =)"
3,Doesn't hold up for very long if you use your card a lot.,"I am what you could call a heavy user. I install and remove my card at least a dozen times a day, every day. This holder just can't handle that. It broke in a couple weeks. Probably be ok for people who don't remove their cards very often. For my usage profile, I can't really recommend it."
1,Does Not Work Well With Ford F 150,"Purchased a Go Rhino Quick Rack for my new 2010 Ford F150. Unfortunately, it does not fit on the side rails as advertised. The Quick Rack supports require more space under the truck side rails than is available. When installed, the supports are just touching and cannot be adequately secured. I was hoping to use the Quick Rack for transporting things like a canoe on long trips. The rack is suitable for very shorts trips and really does not work (afraid that it might come loose while in use. I was really looking forward to this temporary ""on and off"" solution but it just does not work, used it twice now but never again. I am looking for something to replace it that is a little more trustworthy. Too bad as it looks like a great idea but like many things, it is ultimately in the execution and this just does not make it. I would NOT recommend that anyone purchase a Quick Rack for a late model Ford F150, keep looking elsewhere!"
4,pretty good rack for cheap,"The load rating is half that of a metal rack (600 pounds) but I'm only hauling a canoe or a few pieces of lumber. It was difficult to fit on the rail, I think, because the thickness of the bed liner was just a little more than the width of the integral clamps. The tie downs that stabilizes the center rail crosses the gaps between the side supports and makes is difficult to throw stuff in the bed from the side.If you have too much money, I'd go with an aluminum rack. But this is a good rack for a lot less money."
1,brushguard,"ordered a go rhino 3000 brush guard. started with step 1 and no holes drilled for brackets, re ordered piece, took two weeks to get and i will be damned 2nd piece still no holes. also missing screws and nuts in package. companies quality control sucks!!!!!"
4,Fantastic supplement to an already fantastic movie,"This book does a great job of enhancing the experience of watching The Dark Crystal. Objects that are only seen for an instant or merely in the background are explained in detail in this beautiful collection. My only complaint? There's lots of white space on some of the pages, which makes it feel like less of a guide to an ancient world and more like a textbook.Even so, highly recommended for fans of the movie, faerie stuff in general, or just great artwork."
5,The world of the Dark Crystal,"I found this book to be one of the most interesting books I have ever read. Brian Froud creates a detailed explanation of everything from the world of the dark crystal. The illustrations are beautiful, Froud shows such a clear picture that I felt like I was realy there. The World of the Dark Crystal has always fascinated me and Frouds book explains in detail everything i wanted to know about this mistical world af amazing creatures. It is a book i will cherish forever."
4,A Good Workout,"In typical Denise fashion, I always feel energized after completing 2 of the workouts. A couple of the transitions are slightly awkward, otherwise, a good workout."
2,Not as good as the WATP series,"I went through the 4 segments on this DVD for my workout - the 3 1-mile walks and the 10-minute stretch. I was disappointed because I expected a better quality workout from an industry leader like Denise Austin. While doing all 3 walking segments at once did get me sweating, the routines were difficult to follow because there were little, if any, queues to take you to the next move. I clumsily stumbled along for most of the workout, which I hate to do. The only redeeming thing about the DVD was that it at least kept me moving at a fast pace, regardless of whether or not I was able to decipher what she was about to do next, but I didn't have to spend the money to do that!"
4,Walk it...,I bought this for my mother. I thought it was going to be really silly. She loves it and is actually the only exercise tape she has ever stuck with.
3,It's just ok,"I've used a lot of Denise Austin's materials and am usually very happy. This time, however, I was disappointed. I felt the ""walk"" was not a comfortable flow. I do use Leslie Sanson's walk video's and feel much more comfortable with them. She gives better direction."
2,Exercise CD,"Received the wrong CD. :( I was looking forward to Denise Austin's exercise CD, she is very encouraging. I was mailed a different one. :("
3,This one is ok,Some of the moves are a little complicated for me and Denise's voice is a turn-off for me. She seems to be portraying a sexy fitness queen rather than a professional workout person. That is just my opinion. It is a good workout if you can get past the peripheral stuff :)
5,Blast Away the Pounds - Indoor Walk,excellent dvd for indoor walking very promt and excellent service. Recommend to any one who cannot go out for walking.Thanks
2,"Too easy, quite clumsy at points","I should state two points to frame this review: I purchased this DVD more or less on impulse when I first began working out after a lengthy break and I am more familiar with the Walk Away the Pounds series, this was as a trial.I must be honest, I am not so keen on this workout. Divided into three 15 minute segments each progressively harder than the previous I found that I was never too challenged and it was difficult to follow the moves as they changed because Denise's pacing is off. I even tried to add heavier weights to the second workout but even that was too easy.Unlike the extras in the WALP series the women working with Ms. Austin seemed devoid of personality (enthusiasm) and were also poorly paced at points.This DVD would be an alright choice for someone who needs a very light workout or is just beginning but at this time I have taken it out my rotation."
2,Looked unrehearsed,"I have had a lot of Denise Austin exercise tapes and was always very pleased with them, but this CD seemed urehearsed. She was never in sync with the people behind her. Her footwork was always ""off"" compaired to the other ladies exercising. Also, it seemed as though she was making up the mooves as she went along. I had a little trouble following her the first few time because there were several time during the workout that she didn't tell you what was coming next. She could have done with a lot less ""That's it, Good"". Must have said that a hundred times."
3,so-so,i bought this dvd because i wanted to add some variety to my walking workout library and because i loved Denise's Yoga Body Burn dvd. this one is okay for beginners and for your low energy days when you just need to get some time in working out. she is way too annoying on this dvd. too chipper for me! the moves are easy to follow and the music is okay. not a bad one for rotation purposes.
2,Need Upbeat Music,"The video is ""okay"". I thought it could use some upbeat music. I felt if I had not been moving around with Denise I would have fallen asleep standing up. The music is too relaxed for the workout. Also, I wish the segments ran together but at the same time available to choose whatever mile you want. There is slight pause between miles."
3,Not the greatest,"I would have rated this work out higher, but her cuing is not good. You have to memorize all her mistakes in counting in order to do it correctly. And she keeps having to switch feet in order to get back on track with the other walkers. I probably will only do this if I want a definite change. Leslie Sansone is still the best!"
2,Walking workout but annoying coaching.,"I have tried several workout products but, unfortunately, I am not a fan of Denise Austin's coaching style. Her approach to coaching is not genuine and was absolutely annoying after only the first few minutes. She talked entirely too much. I made it through once but can only stand 15 minutes at a time when I try it now. It would be nice to have a feature that is available on some workout DVDs to hear the music but mute out the talking."
1,couldn't go past 8 minutes,"I have many, many walking dvds. This was my second of Denise's. I couldn't get past 8 minutes in this workout. She gave no direction or indication a new move was coming up, not easy to follow, and my her voice was driving me up a wall. I am happy I didn't pay too much for this dvd."
5,Great bang for the buck!,"I recently joined Weight Watchers and have begun the process of getting myself into better physical shape again. I wanted to increase my activity and fitness levels as well as eating better. This DVD has been a great one for me to get me exercising again. I like that it's only 15 minutes, but has a really good level of intensity. There are times when I can barely carve out 15 minutes in a day to exercise, so this is perfect for me. I also like that there are varying levels of intensity depending which program you do. For me, this DVD is awesome!I know some people think that Denise is ""too perky"" or whatever, but I don't think that at all. If I were as fit and successful as her, I'd darn sure be perky too. ;) Maybe one day I'll be able to smile and beam as I exercise too.I give this high recommendations every chance I get."
2,Opt for Something Better,"I think Denise Austin does a decent job in some of her other videos, but this isn't one of them. She lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot. The moves are not well choreographed and very awkward. Some may find encouragement in the times Denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says ""We're burning butter.... yeah"" but I found it annoying. I think there are much better workouts for the money out there."
2,TOO easy,"I am 38 and considered obese, however I work in a busy operating room all day and found this to be too easy. This DVD would be great for the older generations. I still need to loose 45 pounds and I am using Denise Austin's Burn Fat Fast."
3,Blast away the pounds?,"I haven't had this dvd long, but it's alittle weird to me. It really get's on your nerves... rent it before buying if you can!"
1,Great...if you're five-years-old that is,"The DVD is not okay and that's largely because Ms. Austin drove me nuts. I was distracted by her overall presentation, or rather annoyed by the bug-eyed breathlessness of it all. Just because it's walking, doesn't mean the viewer has to be addressed as if he, or she is just learning how to do so. If it's walking you want, I'd buy the DVD ""Get Moving"" with Chris Freytag of Prevention magazine."
2,For Stepford Wives!!!,"Okay, so this was my first Denise Austin experience, but does she really sound like this all the time?I had a hard time staying on cue the first easy walk segment because I was laughing so hard.Denise does better on the high impact stuff. The workout itself was good, but we just couldnt' past her personality. I guess she was at least better than the ""Crunch"" Pilates workout squad and their beloved ""elegant arms""."
3,...better than doing nothing at all,"It's not the best workout DVD I've used, but it serves its purpose on rainy days. Not high intensity at all, but you'll at least work up a sweat."
2,Fake Denise but a Pumping Workout,"I like Denise Austin. I did not like her fake, over the top, too perky 'sell this video' attitude. I did not like the 4 women she had with her, well, I didnt like their fake smiles. This is work, I want to see people with workout faces and maybe an occasional smile. The workout itself for the first 2 miles that i chose to do were kicking my butt and I could not keep up at times. But I wouldnt actually tell anyone to spend money on this one. It would be better to rent from your local library for free."
3,blast,Arrived on time and good condition. The workout is great for home-bound days with bad weather. Walking indoors makes exercise possible and effective.
4,Good excersice,"I love this DVD Im not in the best shape so to compliment my diet I do this dvd. I do 30 minutes and i love it because its very low impact, but still makes me move and I sweat a lot. I think this DVD is for people like me that overweight and not used to excersicing a lot, and as a compliment on a healthy diet. I love it!"
5,Great motivator,Denise Austin is a great motivator. There are 3 levels of walking on this video & it is fun to use. I don't have to keep a treadmill in the house this is a great alternative
2,Annoying!,"I purchased this DVD to complement the Walk Away the Pounds DVDs that I already own. Denise Austin was so annoying that I could not even get through a workout. She is constantly talking, smiling, and making her eyes all big and round. Besides the constant talking, she was always making comments like ""Come on. You can do it"" and ""Good job"".Denise Austin was so annoying that I will not use this DVD again. I will be donating it to Goodwill."
4,Good Workout but......,"This is a good workout. However, I have a hard time watching Denise. She seems scripted and a little possessed. Her voice is irritating and she is dyslexic with some of her sentences. i.e. ""Okay now put both hands in the weights."" When she really meant ""Okay now put both weights in one hand"". The dvd indicates a ""music only"" option but I can't figure out how to activate this feature. I'll continue to use the workout and try to ignore Denise."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm used to biggest loser type workout dvd's so this was a disappointment for me. I knew it wouldn't be as hard of a work out, but it was way too easy and I felt really stupid doing it. Strictly for a beginner. I wouldn't recommend to an intermediate."
2,For Beginners A Fair Workout,"I thought the workout was decent for a beginner to exercise & fitness, it's broken up into 3 separate miles. The first one is easiest, the second has some intervals where it's more challenging and the third has some weights. A real beginner could do the first mile and progress through the second and third miles over time.However, this is my first experience with Denise Austin, and I found her to be very condescending and annoying. I thought she was not genuine at all and talked to me like I was 5 and in pre-school. I don't know if she is always like this but she just isn't my style. Also I found it a bit too easy of a workout, and I thought it was poorly cued, as well. I think I could get used to seeing the next move coming, and the moves themselves aren't complex or difficult, but she doesn't give you a lot of instruction in what's coming next or how to do it.Not a bad workout for beginners, but not a good instructor either is my overall impression."
2,Deceptive Description,"I ordered two of these glasses based on the 12 oz. description, expecting that they would hold the complete contents of a 12 oz. beverage can. Instead, I measured that they held 11 oz. filled to the brim. While the quality of the glass seems good and they would be adequate when sharing a draft pitcher, they don't meet the purposes for which I bought them."
2,all the songs sound the same,I think all the songs sound the same and like she is trying to sound like Avril.
1,"The sound is Manufactured, but young kids will like it","The CD sounds manufactured in a studio. The tracks are not fresh, and no natural singing talent comes through. A lot of background noice but catchy none the less."
4,Worth Buying,Perry Como is great to listen to for people who love traditional Christmas songs such as I do. I was not dissapointed at all. He puts his own touch on the wonderful standards.
5,Perfect Perry!,Perry Como's smooth voice and talent shine on this album. Great for Christmas parties or just for listening. I highly recommend this album. A talent not to be replaced.
3,One song missing,"This cd looks great,but there is one song missing:""Christmas Eve."" Does anyone remember this album?? It has Como in the middle of a wreath on a wood door, I think. The first song on the album is ""Christmas Eve"" and the second song is ""Do You hear What I hear"". Has anyone seen this album or have it?? It's a great holiday album. It reminds me of my childhood."
3,need the 1968 xmas album,"Other reviewers are correct: this is a very good compilation. However, we still need the all of the songs from the 1968 Christmas Album re-released on CD (preferably together). Maybe next year?"
5,Another Page Turner from Ms. Jenkins,"With a new cast of characters, Ms. Jenkins fills your appetite for a spicy love story that leaves you more knowledgable about little talked about areas of African-American history. Ms. Jenkins's male lead, Ryder, is hot, sexy and all man. And you won't find Leah (the heroine) sitting in a field of flowers, drinking tea and waiting to get rescued by a big, strong man--although Ryder easily steps up to protect his woman. The characters are original, sensuous and fun. Enjoy!Kimberley White, Author of ""Sweet Tomorrows"""
4,Before The Dawn,"This is the first time I have read any of Beverely Jenkins's books, I like reading romance novels with realism. This book is brillant, she describes men and women as they really are. I also learned a lot about African American history in the 1880s, which I found very interesting. Ryder Damien is a man, who would blow your mind away. Well Done Beverley!"
4,Good expose.,"Louis Montague is like a father to Leah Barnett, and she is devastatedthat he is dying. He marries her and makes her his heir, but she must takecare of unfinished business for him after he dies. She must find his twosons in Colorado, whom he has not seen for thirty years. She goes about his business, and, with his right hand man Cecil Lee, goes to Coloradoto meet Louis' sons--and finds a hotbed of ill will. Beverly Jenkins sheds light on late 19th-century society underJim Crow laws, showing how hard it was for Blacks to ride a train or beserved in a restaurant. But in addition to the insight, this well writtentale features an intriguing mystery, a touch of courtroom drama and pulsepounding romance."
4,Love and Drama,"Berverly has done a vary good job with this new book. I really liked the way the story line flowed. This book was written with her usual format but with a twist I found shocking. I knew something was up and Beverly gave suttle hints. But I was not ready for the dark side of this character. The leading man ""Ryder""(Before the Dawn) has moved into second place running close to ""Gaylen""(Topaz) in my book. You go girl, I enjoy your books and can not wait till May to read your least creation."
3,"Great product, but.....","I love the armband for the i-pod. However, my arms are skinny and the armband is too big for my arm. I wish I could make it smaller. I am able to make it work, but it doesn't look the greatest....."
3,Great Gym Band,"I have had this for several years, it finally split by the band after at least 2 years of reliable service. The band is no longer big enough for my arms, so if you have 18""+ arms you may want to look for something with a larger arm band. When my arms hit 21"" the tension became unbearable, and at some point the silicone ripped.It is a great product, protects the Ipod Nano well, and is comfortable."
2,Armband too long.,This armband will be too long for most women. I bought it as a gift and it wouldn't fit her.
5,Perfect.,"Simple, effective, and exactly what it needs to be. It gets the job done right. And yes, you can remove the strap when you don't need it."
3,"Ok product, problems with fitting","I bought the product with iPod Nano v2. It fits Ok. I am having problems with operating the hold button, inserting the earphones. I wish the cover was better fit nano so operation could have been easier.Rest all is fine. Works..."
2,The armband is too big.,"I bought this for when I workout and the armband is too big for my arm. I realize I'm a bit skinny, but still I'm 5'11"", porportionally, I have a bigger arm than say a 5'1"" girl. This band is made more for the 20"" bi's guy - lol."
3,it's ok,Works well but the strap doesn't handle my wife's skinny arm's well. We had to rig it with a safety pin. This could be fixed by using a double buckle or more velcro but overall it's ok
5,The best arm band that I have owned,I have had this armband for a little over a year and it is by far the best armband that I have ever owned. I run 6 days a week and never leave home with it. The opening for the music wheel is pretty convenient for quickly changing tunes without having to stop exercising. The construction of the elastic on this armband is pretty strong and shows no signs of wearing out. I would definitely recommend it.
2,Works OK but ...,"When I put my Nano in the sleeve it is very difficult to operate the hold switch on the top of the Nano.There is a screen protector and it is a nice idea but I have not been able to get the label sticker completely off of the screen protector so there's a portion of the screen I cannot see clearly.I don't have any problem with operating the arm strap, but that's about the only thing I like."
2,"Works, but nothing special","I got this for jogging and it gets the job done, but I won't buy another of the same brand. My main complaint is that it doesn't adjust tight enough for a small woman's arm. I have it as tight as the velcro will allow and it still slips off my bicep. Also, the rubbery part that holds the iPod leaves gooey streaks on my arm if I wear it with sunscreen. Pretty gross."
2,Good at first but not for long,This armband worked great for a couple months but then the elastic started breaking down. It's not made for small arms in the first place so after a while it got really loose and not too comfortable. Also it's open on the front and top so no working out in the rain. :(
4,Nano sports sleeve,It is very comfortable and works well when running or working out. I just love it. Best thing I got since the Nano. must have for people on the go.
4,i like it,this sleeve is decent. It fits okay and stays there during my workout. It also holds the ipod safely.
4,Ipod Nano Sports Sleeve,Good looking sleeve with soft black rubber case that fits the ipod nano perfectly. The only thing is that you have to turn the case upside down so that the ipod doesn't fall out when you're running.
1,Thin Arms? Don't Buy it!,"Swayed by the overwhelmingly positive reviews on here, I bought this armband despite the few reviews that noted it might be too large for anyone with thin arms. Surely, I thought, since this was a product designed for people who RUN, its armband couldn't be THAT large.Now, I'll be the first to admit: I have skinny, wimpy arms that will look like sticks no matter what I do. But arms that are, you know, pretty typical for the class of people I had assumed Belkin designed this armband for. But this doesn't come close to fitting my arm--the Velcro would need to extend for about three more inches to make this tight enough to stay on. The case itself is fine, but not worth the purchase if you can't use the armband as well.After this sat in my desk drawer for a couple months, I gave it to my mother so she could use it at the gym. And you know what? Last time I went home I saw the ipod in its case, sans armband. Too big for her, too!"
2,Not so happy,"I bought this armband for my husband for Christmas, and found that the screen and circular selector on the iPod nano 2G does not line up with the screen and circle on the armband. While he is running, he has to play the nano without being able to control the songs that he is listening to. This is ok with him because he doesn't really play with the nano once he starts running, but it still would be nice if it did fit the correct way."
4,"Great product, one suggestion","The sports sleeve is great! One suggestion I have is to mention that the arm band only comes in one size, which didn't really fit my arm. I don't know if there is a difference between a man's size arm band & a woman's size but maybe you can mention that the arm band may not fit small arms? I did write to the seller about this and received immediate follow up letting me know that unfortunately there is only one size. The seller also offered to allow me to return the item but I had already opened the box & threw away some of the packaging. I've ""MacGyvered"" the arm band to make it fit at this point. Besides the arm band size, the quality is great!"
3,Good protection but...,It protects my nano quite well but the sleeve interferes with the USB synch cable.
4,Great Product!,I really like this sleeve. I jog in the mornings and this band seems to stay in place great on my arm without sliding down or coming loose. It holds the Ipod snuggly and seems well made.
3,Decent,"The sleeve works pretty well, but the elastic on the armband is a tad too long and the velcro is kind of weak. But it beats paying $30 for the Apple version."
5,Great product,Its comfortable and is adjustable enough to fit snugly to enjoy while running or lifting with out really being noticed because of the elsatic!
4,Does its job,"Not sure what you expect out of an armband, but if it includes holding your ipod and fitting around your arm, this one succeeds."
2,Women Beware!,"The strap is WAY too big.....and I don't think my arms are all that small. My bicep is 10 1/2 inches. I had to cut a 2 inch piece off and sew it back together. Besides that I like it, works great with Nike +"
2,Too big for me,I agree with the other person who said the armband is too big. I am a female as well but have someone muscular arms. It kept falling down. It's not worth the money to return but I do have to buy another brand. I say buy if you believe you have a big arms.
2,"Okay, I guess...","While the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice (feels grippy but not sticky if you know what I mean), some of the features are just wrong. For instance, the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all - requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off. Also, for whatever reason, the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use (the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out).The armband is satisfactory at best - it's just a standard, no frills, velcro armband."
1,bad result,"i got the product fairly quick for being in Iraq. however, the strap ripped after having 1 1/2 weeks. I only use it 1 hour out of a day. It was obviously poorly made. Not a quality product. Very upset about it."
3,You get what you pay for,"This arm band does the job, but the holes dont line up exactly with the new 4g nano. The hold switch is especially a pain. The arm band itself is probably too thin but it does the job."
1,Not Impressed,"This arm band for the Ipod Nano is nothing special, rubber material is vry thin and cheap feeling, i was certainly not impressed and heve since replaced it with a better one!!!!! It does not fit the Ipod very well and mine slides out very easily."
3,Nano Silicon Sleeve,"it's ok but a little itchy, works great if you have it over your sleeve, but on bare skin it is irritating, it does keep slipping down if you dont have it tight enough, then it gets itchy, better working on a belt"
3,Works well but not a great fit for 2G ipod nano,"This is adequate for running or taking to the gym. It's made for the 1G ipod nano, so the 2G nano doesnt fit perfectly inside and shifts around, making it a little difficult to change songs sometimes. It's light (i found some of the other models to be bulky) and well worth the price. If you're like me and just using it for exercise, dont waste your money on more expensive cases."
5,Fine product,"It is as good as has been described. Fits very well, the material it is made of is very good as well.Definitely recommended!"
3,Its OK,"This product is very good for older teen and adults. I purchased this for my 14 year old and was too big for the ""One Size Fits All."""
3,its ok.....,"not really a bad product, i just prefer to keep constricting bands off me while working out... i keep my ipod in the rubber case but tossed the band somewhere, never used it, its great without the band..."
2,"If it's free, it's not usualy worth much...","That is what I have always said, and it stands true to this product. I received this thing for free when I ordered an 8GB ipod. This thing is flimsy and offers no protection to your ipod other than scratch resistance. As far as something just to workout with, I am sure this would be fine, but there are better units that are worth the money."
1,IPod Nano Sports Sleeve,"I purchased the new Ipod Nano last month and this sports sleeve was linked as a recommended purchase. They were both intended as birthday gifts for my son. The sleeve isnt intended for the new, smaller Nano with video and is way to large to fit it. Product should not be linked or recommended with new IPod Nano. I ended up throwing it in the trash as it was useless to him."
1,iPod Sports Sleeve,I never received this product and I still got charged for shipping on it. This is the only problem I have ever had buying on Amazon.
3,ATTENTION WOMEN!,"Even though I had read some of the 1-3 stars review about many women complaining that the armband didn't fit them, I decided to purchase it anyway because I'm not absurdly thin nor am I big or even chubby. WRONG DECISION! My arms are not in any way fat but they aren't overly thin either however this arm band didn't fit my arm and kept sliding down. I would recommend this armband to men only or heavier women only. I let my boyfriend keep it and it fit great on him, overall its a nice sports sleeve, not the best but it does the job if you manage to get it to fit your arm that is. It does fit the Ipod Nano 2gen you just have to make sure you've fitted it correctly, my boyfriend said it's really comfortable and he hasn't had any trouble accessing the click-wheel or any other button."
4,Easy to use and comfortable,"I've been using this for several weeks now, and my overall review is positive. It's easy to get my nano in and out of the sleeve itself, and the band is comfortable while working out. My only complaint is that the band can't be adjusted to a sufficiently small size for me-- it always ends up too loose. I'm on the thinner side, but by no means the thinnest person I know. If you have slim arms, this is probably not the right nano sleeve for you."
3,Functional,"Functional, yet barely. Fine while running, but not easy to access once on your arm, making it difficult to see the time, use the stopwatch, or change tunes."
1,Doesn't fit my arm,"I'm not a really small person (5'4"", 120 pounds) and the band is too big for my arm. I tried to pull the band all the way around the iPod, but that didn't work either. This was a giant waste of money. Probably good for a guy, but not good (or adaptable) for someone with smaller arms."
4,Protecting Nano,"Nice to see and to touch.Good sheltering for the device, although the screen protector is a funny transparent sleeve"
3,Too big!,"If you have skinny arms, this will be too large!! I tried to get a refund, but since it was cheap to begin with, i would have lost money because of the shipping and handling. I was able to sew it together so that it is small enough to use...but it looks a little funny! (note: my upper arm is about 9 to 9 1/2 inches in circumference.)"
4,"Good, but not sure long term","For the price, the Belkin Sports Sleeve seems to do the trick. I've been using it for three weeks now with only minimal complaint.It holds my iPod Nano fine for multiple-hour walks, but tends to slide a little on my arm in the heat, even when adjusted fairly tightly. Also, I have to make sure the band is over my T-shirt. Direct skin contact seems to give me a little rash, but that may just be me.I'm a bit concerned about the band life after it gets sweated-up a bit more. It's already getting looser. That remains to be seen. Overall, I'm satisfied."
4,Nice product.,"This is a nice little protective case for the IPOD mini which fits easily over bulky clothes or on a bare arm. It stays put and does the job for which it was intended. The case fits well and has openings in all the right places. I use it both at the gym and in the car just as a protector and have no complaints. It is not the most stylish sport sleeve, but is all in all an excellent product for the money."
2,WAY TOO BIG,I wish I had rippling biceps. Then maybe this sports sleeve wouldn't slip right off and I wouldn't have wasted my money. Or maybe i wish a smaller size had been offered.Or perhaps I should have just read all the previous reviews that pointed out the same thing :/
4,Just what I needed,"This is a great product if you don't like to carry around your mp3 player while exercising. The band is adjustable, but if your arms are massive, you'd need to wear it around your forearm instead."
5,Great buy,"Wow, these were so cheap and they do the job. Bought 3 of them, they don't expand very well when I lift but they expand enough. They didn't fit my gf nor my sister's arm, but they just unstiched it and sewed it up and perfect fit."
4,Good Product,"This is a great product, it works better on 1st generation nano's because of the position of the head phone jack on the 2nd generations and the shape is a little bit different. I use this on my 2nd generation and it works pretty well and it can be used with the Nike+ kit since it does not have any bottom. This is a very light weight case and holder and works well but it would work better with a 1st generation."
3,A little difficult to wrap around arm,"The rubber casing is great, but the arm band is a little bulky and somewhat of a production to hook through the rubber casing and wrap around the arm. I don't have experience with other products, but I can't help but think there should be an easier way to get this done every time I go for a run."
2,BIG ARMBAND,"I bought this for my 16-yr-old son. He is a long distance runner, and well the armband is to big for him as well as to big for me and I am not super thin. So, If you are not a grown man, with a well developed upper arm.... We are going to try and sew it to fit his arm."
2,not exactly match fit for the gen 2 nano,"This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place. The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the ""hold"" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off. The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod. I finally just gave up on it and returned it. I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag. I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options. Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano?"
1,Women beware,"I recently purchased the sports sleeve, but was disappointed - although I liked the silicone sleeve for the iPod and thought it was a great idea I was very upset when I tried to put the sleeve on my arm and it fell right off. As a woman with small, but not ridiculously thin arms, i found that the sports band could not be made tight enough. It would work very well for people with larger arms, but slender women should know that it will not fit them. The only way it could be made to fit is if you were to purchase extra velcro and sew it on, but that's not really practical."
2,OK ipod case,"The sleeve for the ipod is nice and comes with a screen cover, but the arm band doesn't adjust to become small enough for my small, feminine arm."
3,Not for 2nd gen iPods,"Two complaints about this item1) Not designed for the 2nd generation iPod Nanos. The holes do not correctly line up.2) Not designed for women. I bought this for my wife to use in the gym, and the arm band is way to big for her."
2,not for small arms!,"The skin is great - I plan on keeping it on my nano for travel and any other use, regardless of the armband... which won't be a problem since the tightest I can wrap it is still not adequate for my upper arm. I've not had problems with getting a snug fit from any other armband in the past (I guess my arm's somewhat small, but definitely not abnormally so), so I was dissappointed in this one.. have to switch it out with an old one that I've been using, which is really gross at this point. :)"
5,Great product!,"I'm so glad I ordered this sleeve. I was a little worried because it was so cheap but it's just a great product at a great price! The band is super comfortable and stays in place well. I use it for cycling, walking, running, working out at the gym, and lawn mowing. It's never let me down.Also, it works well for both 1st and 2nd gen nanos."
1,Fell apart!,I bought this and the stitching on the band fell apart after a few months (four). I do use it 5-6 days a week while lifting and doing cardio. Now I'm buying the nike one instead. I had to staple this one to keep it together - it's worthless.
3,sleeve works,"I think this works. Theres nothing fancy about it. I wish it had a clear protective cover for the display screen, and somewhere for the earphone cords to go, but other than that it works as I need it to."
3,Ok as long as you don't have thin arms,"The sleeve is fantastic, holds the ipod well and is comfortable, as long as it fits your arm. I am not a thin woman, but petite enough that the band is loose enough that it slips down. I'm returning mine because I simply can't use it on my arm, but if you aren't petite then I'd go for it."
5,Bell Nd Howell bulbs,Givesme the light I need to read. I have macular degeneration and I need a lot of light to read by.
4,WYSIWYG,"They are as pictured. Small. Cute. Fun. The plugs are a challenge to get out and put in, so you better like the shakers. But what's a couple of minutes' challenge once in a while? The shakers are nerdy & cute."
3,Works well but does not last long,"I have used these pumps since 2001. They work great but you only get about 2 seasons out of them. I live in the north where we get snow and rain for the winter season so I have a lot of opportunity to observe the operation and quality. I have a Merlin solid cover for my pool and use these to keep the water off in the closed season which for us is 9 months per year. I have gone through probably 5 of these pumps since the 1st one. I need another now as it just went bad again. I am going to try the ""Rule H53SP-24 Marine Rule 1800 Pool Cover Pump with 24-Foot Cord/Wide Base"""
1,Poor functioning,The pump does not automatically cut off whenthe water is pumped off. The pump hasto be manually turned off which defeats thepurpose of the pump.
2,The little automatic pump that could'nt,"My 85 yr. old mother asked me to buy her a pump online with an auto function.She had this same type of pump for 5-6 years that served her well until the auto on switch malfunctioned.I thought this new pump may have had improvements to the switch in the past few years,but to my chagrin,the new pump auto on switch hasn't worked correctly right out the box.And my mom has lost the invoice for the pump.I guess some things are best bought locally (for exchange purposes)..."
1,about as tough as an EGG save your money,"I had two of these pumps, and they both failed the same way, the cord enterng the housing became brittle and broke alowing water into the motor. Called the company, and they did not want to hear about it. No customer service, they were awful they don't even make replacement parts, what does that tell you?"
1,Impractical to use,"This pump looks like the old model but it has two deal killers. First, it now uses two cords that need to be tied together (if you use only the one main cord, it operates manually, which I've never needed to do in 15 years of using these pumps) which is very unwieldly, especially if it's raining already when you're putting the pump on the poll cover. Second, the main plug has a small plastic air tube that should not come into contact with water. Good luck with that if your power source is further away than these 25 foot cords allow and you're using an extension cord like I need to. Consider instead the Little Giant APCP-1700 (577301) that has only one cord, no strange plug air tube, and is even heavier so that more of the water on the cover drains towards the pump (a problem with lighter pumps - much of the water towards the cover boundaries just sits there)."
1,Little Giant Pump poor choice,"Don't purchase this pump. I purchased this exact pump in the summer of 2006. We used it for one winter season. When we placed the pump on the winter cover for the 2007-2008 season, it would not turn on. The motor was completely frozen. When I inquired about a replacement I was told there was nothing the company could do since there is only a 1 year warranty. In actuality, it was only in use for 5 months. BUYERS BEWARE!!!"
3,Little Giant 5-APCP Automatic Pool Cover Pump,Works well. The auto-shut off leaves to much water on pool cover. I have to by pass auto-shut off and manually remove water by plugging in without auto-shut off plug.
2,Received product broken,"This is my 3rd pool cover pump from Little Giant. I must be a masochist for ordering the same product over and over again. After a year or two, the pumps all malfunction because the immersion on/off switch fails. On my last order, some of the plastic pieces were broken so I have to go through the process of replacing them. I do not recommend this product!"
4,Great Pool Cover Pump,This is a great swimming pool cover pump. It automatically turns on when water is detected and off when dry. I have had no issues with it whatsoever it does what it is supposed to do.
1,dont waste your money,"lot of money for 2 pool seasons which equal about 8 months of use.Had 2 , just put the second in the trash"
2,"When it works it's great, when not, can't be repaired","Have had 3 in the past 4 years. When it works, its fantasic. The problem is that its a sealed unit, so if something internal goes, it can't be fixed. We live in the Northeast, so it gets quite cold. Though we tried to take it out everyime it gets cold, it has not always been the case. The float on the unit will sometimes freeze. Looks like all the times the unit has failed it was due to oil leaking out of the seal where the electric cord goes in. The first time it failed was most likely because we use to pull the pump out by the electric cord. The last two units were done from the hose itself, but still has leaked.Going to look at another brand/unit."
2,not very durable,"I'm on my third or forth of this model, and I won't buy another. My first lasted several years without problem, but the last few have only lasted a year or two."
2,Not For 2002 Nissan Xterra SE SC,"Don't be a duma55 like me and buy it for your ""2002 Nissan Xterra SE SC"" even though Gibson's personel said it should fit."
4,A chilling view of serial murder in the near future.,"Given that we all are to some extent a product of our parentage, consider your reaction if you became aware that YOUR father was a game playing serial killer. Could or would you go after him? How best to protect your dying mother? These are just a few of the questions that face the main characters of Katzenbach's page turner."
2,formula works...for a transcontinental flight,"while this book is a by the numbers novel with cardboard characters and a somewhat stale plot, if you engage in a willing suspension of disbelief, it does make for great airplane reading (just about long enough for san francisco to new york, be sure to watch the movie though). sure parts are boring, but the premise that everyone of us is vulnerable and potentially a victim puts an interesting edge on what is otherwise mind candy."
5,Definately worth reading and keeps interest throughout .,I am also confused about the disparity in the ratings of this novel. It was similar to a Patterson novel in a futuristic setting. The ending sets up for an interesting sequel. I'll be eagerly awaiting it and disappointed if it's not written.
1,could it get anymore boring?,"i read the first 2 chapters and the last 4 chapters because the middle was so boring, and even though i skipped so many chapters, it was still boring! this is such a bad book."
2,Most uneven to me.,"After reading the book I can understand the disparity in the customer reviews. ""State of Mind"" was a disappointment to me as I found Mr. Katzenbach's ""Hart's War"" & ""Shadowman"" among the best books I have ever read. Parts of ""State of Mind"" just flew by and I became quite engrossed...then periods of dull nonaction. Perhaps it was just too long. Were it not for my faith in Mr. Katzenbach's writing there were many times I would have quit this one. Kept figuring it would pick up in the next chapter. Ending is a pretty good payoff, but takes too long to get there and it's a plodding journey. Set in a Blade Runner world the overall plot made sense and the characters were well drawn. Mr. Katzenbach has entertained me before and will again."
1,Boring! A waste of time!,"I was extremely surprised at this new book by John Katzenbach. I have read his other books with relish and found them to be thrilling. Until now.I believe you have to be in a certain state of mind to read ""State of Mind"". The book starts off with the right note. We are aware of a danger to the Claytons; and the way Jeffrey is roped into the game - nicely done. After that, it is all psychological mumbo-jumbo. Every chapter deals with the psychological makeup of the characters. One can say that ""State of MInd"" deals with the mind. But too much is too much. What thrills the book might have provided was lost in the jungle of psychology.How boring was the book? I gave up reading it at chapter 12. The good thing about the book? I did not buy it"
5,good idea well developed,"My first Katzenbach book and based upon what other reviewers wrote, I see I should get hold of some of his others.I found the ideas presented here intriguing - what can become of the States giving the increasing violence, one possible solution and the thinking behind it, the mind of the serial killer, fears in the killer's offspring regarding their own character traits, the games people play with each other and themselves.I liked how the author wove in aspects of serial-killer-history and sent me to google these and find out more.This is one of the few detective/thriller novels where I didn't skip over the descriptive paragraphs just to get to the ""action"", because I found that the action was partly in the scenery and the characterizations.Totally enjoyable read."
2,Disappointing,"Katzenbach is a good writer. His ""The Analyst"" is one of the best thrillers I've read. And Hart's war and The Madmans Tale are well written gripping stories. However with State of Mind I found my own mind wandering as I read it. Somehow it is too long and not particularly compelling. The future America he devises where everyone is armed and guards escort office workers to their cars is not perhaps far fetched but felt superficial. It merely existed as a counterpoint for a new 51st State where everyone was safe.Don't bother with this book, especially when Katzenbach has written so much better."
2,Maybe when my son is older,I bought this book to read to my 2 year old and it just did not work for him. The story is about a cow that has bigger dreams that she wants her owner to help her acomplish. It was hard for my son to relate to the book so he lost intrest - not that he does not have dreams it was more the types of dreams the cow had (ie going to outer space) - he was not yet familiar enough with outerspace to get into it. The book was also quite wordy.It will be on our shelf till he is ready for it. Good book but maybe for an older kid.
5,beautiful tribute to Rumi.......,"Rumi truly is a poet of the heart. The late, great Persian poet writes prose that truly stirs your emotions and touches your soul. This beautiful film narrated by Debra Winger features some of Rumi's greatest fans (including Deepak Chopra and Robert Frost), readings of some of his most-loved works and beautiful oud accompaniment played by the great virtuouso Hamza Al Din. I love the meditative atmosphere of this piece and it really moved me. I reccomend RUMI: POET OF THE HEART to great fans of Rumi, as well people who have never heard of him before. This is a great introduction to the mood and sentiment of his works and shows the range of emotions he captured in his writing."
2,Repetitious and Barely Useable Book!,"For someone who supposedly collects crackle glass, this book's author has enough repeats of the same items to make you dizzy!!! Sometimes the same item is pictured twice on the same page for the same category. One Fry lidded pitcher is found NINE times, a green decanter is found THIRTEEN times, an amberina decanter SIX times, an unidentified decanter SEVEN times!!! On page 30, she says, ""These Five Collectible Areas Increase the Value of Crackle Glass: Numbers 1-4 Characteristics will increase value....Number 5 Characteristic will increase value...."" BUT I never found those five areas!!!!!!!!For anyone who wants to have any hope of identifying or pricing a variety of crackle glass, this IS NOT THE BOOK for you!!! On the only positive note, the values the author DOES give seem to be fair and accurate."
5,Collecting Crackle Glass: With Values,This book arrived in very good condition. It has all the information I was interested in because I have a collection that I will be selling at the neighborhood antique shop. The discriptions will help me to document the origions and fairly price each piece.Patricia Vodika
5,Great book for the beginner,I ordered this book expecting a lot of computer jargon that I would not understand. I am new to programming and this book really helped me learn a few things about VB5 and web development. The instructions were very informative and really explained how everything works. There were lessons to follow that made everything easier for me. The CD that comes with the book was very helpful and made the location of the code in the book easily accessible for reference. I would recommend this book to anyone learning VB5 and web development.
1,White Trash? What White Trash?,"Now if you ask me, and plenty folk who identify with the white trash moniker do, this here CD doesn't really have much to do with white trash and has more to do with the September Eleventh attacks. I got this disc because I assumed, by looking at the title that I would find some music that the Huckabee clan could listen to inside our warm, comfortable double wide trailer while we heat up some spam casserole with bit of real marshmallow on top (one of Mama's secret recipes!) but in stead we got us a CD full of nonsense about problems over in the Middle East and all that. What about pink plastic yard flamingoes? What about refrigerators lined up against the trailer? What about the three cars up on blocks? This CD don't highlight the life of the average white trash family and therefore ought to be re-titled ""Some White guy sings some songs about the Middle East problems and it has little to do with Christmas."" That would be a good title."
4,White trash christmass,If you want to relieve the boredom of listening to the same old christmass stuff this is it.
4,Collection,Add comedy christmas to traditional songs during the season.This on has some real funny ones!
1,"Better than ""I Am Santa"" but still lousy","The parody of Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer was fair, but the rest is a waste of CD space. Buy Dr. Demento, you'll laugh more."
1,Another cash in on 9/11,"I hate this album. Half of the songs are about 9/11,terrorists, etc. and the other half are just plain stupid. You want parody christmas music? Get Mr. Hankey's X-mas Classics."
4,There'll be cousins kissin' and front teeth missin'.,"This was the fifth Christmas album released by Bob Rivers. It features parodies of Christmas songs and parodies of regular songs done Christmas style. The songs here sound remarkably like the songs they are parodying. For example, the girl who sings the Carpenters parody ""Merry Christmas Allah"" sounds just like Karen Carpenter. There are also accurate imitations of Eminem, Afroman, Dean Martin and others. And besides that, the songs are very funny. If you like funny Christmas songs, you'll probably enjoy this CD."
4,"And take this fruitcake, too","Bob Rivers is a parodist par excellence. I doubt there's any style he hasn't attempted and he's done both holiday and regular songs. His CDs are so well done if you mix them in with the regular music, only people who're listening will know the difference.This particular CD is for the trailer park and pink flamingo crowd. One caveat, there really is nothing sacred on this CD.It's hard to pick a favorite--what I have found with the other Bob Rivers' CD is that I tend to like different songs through the season depending on my mood. Here are a few standouts:""Me and Mrs. Claus"" is a hilarious take on a man playing 'Backdoor Santa' to Mrs. Claus while Santa's slippin' presents in people's stockings.""Merry Christmas, Allah"" is an irreverent take on the Carpenter's schmalty standard--and if like me, you think the original has been overplayed since the first year, you're going to really enjoy this one.""Aquaclaus"" takes Aqualung to the Department Store at Christmastime."
2,Not necessary,"Well played, competent musicianship that adds absolutely nothing to Miles' original interpretations."
2,Only for the die-hard fan,"As a devoted fan of the Wonder Years, I must say that I was disappointed in this video collection. Not only is the quality poor (fading in and out, scratchiness, etc.) but there are only two episodes per video (on this one and on vol. 1). I appreciate the early episodes, but they definitely made a mistake by passing up some of the gems of the later seasons (""The Lake""/cara episode, ""Goodbye"", anything with Becky Slater...and of course, the 2-part series finale). Unless you're desperate and this is truly your only option, I would recommend holding out until something better comes along."
4,CT Unraveled,"A useful and pragmatic approach to cognitive therapy. Finally, a professional reference text on CT that I can jump to quickly without having to sift through pages of filler. A wonderful addition to any mental health professional's personal library."
3,Great Holiday Movie,"I like this movie. It's funny throughout but there are some parts that are downright hilarious. While the family portrayed is nothing like my family (ie. we all seem to enjoy each others company during the holidays) there are issues about family in the movie that I believe we all can relate to. It's right up there on my holiday watch list of Grinch, and It's A Wonderful Life."
1,NOT Very Realistic,"I should have read others negative reviews about this film before buying it because I wanted a film to watch for Thanksgiving... ABOUT Thanksgiving. So much of the one star reviewer's critiques are correct. The lighting was poor and it is filmed very darkly, and the comedy is just not that amusing. The family is dysfunctional to the point I would just turn and walk out of the house. I love Anne Bancroft... even her performance grated on me. IMDB claims that Robert Downey was on heroin during the filming... at least he HAS an excuse. Even MORE surprising perhaps is that Jodie Foster directed it because as an actress, she's tremendous.Look, taste is subjective, I'm sure many people loved the film and that's fine. I didn't."
2,"Mildly amusing, but too scattered","A coworker recommended this, so I rented it for the Thanksgiving weekend. I was sorely disappointed. All the actors did a good job, however the underlying story just seemed too scattered to me. Very unfocused. The writer, director, whoever should have picked ONE angle and stayed with it. It would have been hilarious if it was just all the family's dysfunctional stuff. It would have been romantic if it was a love story between Claudia and Leo. It would have been sweet if it was the family putting aside the bad times and remembering the good times and rediscovering each other. Instead, we get ALL of this and, in my opinion, it was just a jumbled confused mixed stew. I'm sorry I wasted my $2.50 at Blockbuster on this un-funny hodgepodge."
2,like fruitcake,"Robert Downey Jr is a hoot. But no one else in this movie measures up. Direction is ploddding; chracterization, mawkish."
1,Bore My Dog,"Yes, I thought this movie was something of a bore. Tired idea--my crazy dysfunctional family that I have to visit at holiday time. Hey, I guess they're not so bad after all--what an epiphany!The REALLY low point of the film is that Geraldine Chaplin plays a nutty old aunt who keeps breaking wind at inappropriate junctures. I mean, really! Why did she take such a humiliating role? Could she have thought that this was humorous? She sure has sunk pretty low since her days as Sonia, Dr. Zhivago's wife.Please, when you go home for ANY reason, don't look at this one."
1,This is no Holiday movie.,"It's nothing but depressing. Isn't real life bad enough without watching this depressing story. Isn't Christmas basically surpose to be a time of joy?When i watch a Holiday movie, I want to be entertained. There is nothing wrong with sadness or crying in a movie, but there is a difference between crying in a movie because it's so sad or beautiful to downright depressing.There is enough of depressing things that go on in this world without having to view this movie. Why these great actors had to stoop to making this terrible depressing movie is beyond me."
4,Home for the Holidays,Great movie! Great product - nice to receive such great merchandise at such a great bargain. This movie was hard to find. Thanks goodness Amazon had it!
3,OK NOT GREAT,"TYPICALLY I LOVE HOLLY HUNTER, BUT EVEN HER TALENT DID NOT CREATE ANY INTEREST FOR ME. THIS IS MOST LIKELY TOO TRUE TO REALLY ENJOY, A LARGELY DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY--- NOT WORTH PAYING MONEY FOR. JUST STEP NEXT DOOR AND GET THIS FOR FREE."
2,A Holiday Classic--NOT!,"I was dissapointed overall with this movie, it is far from a holiday classic! Yes, it has its funny and very funny moments, its serious (although tainted) moments and some brief touching moments, but it lacks the wonderful scenery of a classic movie, the absence of ""a usuable message"" in the overall story, and contains entirely too many profane words (unless you think that makes a movie qualify as a classic) all on George Carlin's ""7 words you can't say on television"" list. Not something I want my daughters to watch! Also the family is not a ""typical"" one either, at least not in the sense of what I remember a family to be. Go ahead and rent this movie, but don't waste your money buying it, there are far more better classic holiday movies out there to add to your collection."
5,!Great holiday movie!,"This is one of the best holiday movies! Watch it several times every year! It addresses the fact that most families have issues of one sort or another. We don't all really like all of our family members, but they are still family. Live and let live! We still love them!"
5,DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY MEMBER,"I saw this movie years ago and haven't been able to find it at my local video stores. My friend suggested Amazon and within a few days it was on my doorstep. Can't wait to watch it with my two kids that are home from college for the holiday. I hope they get the humor because it's a good movie and almost makes my family feel a little more ""normal"". Thanks for the quick delivery and good price on a movie that I have been waiting to see again for a long time."
5,Watch this on Thanksgiving!,The ultimate in crazy family dynamics! A fun movie to watch on Thanksgiving night after everything is cleaned up and put away.
3,Corney,"Each actor did their best. The directing was also good. But, overall, the story was unbelievable. It was corny and unrealistic, even if the screenplay was written based on someone's family. And the last scene, just doesn't seem to happen in""real life"". It was missing something. I didn't feel ""heart warmth"" at the end, I felt glad I didn't go to the movies to see it. Bit Boring. Sorry."
5,Holiday Classic,"Holiday classic!! Talk about dysfunctional!! If you think your family is bad, watch this movie and then appreciate your family even more."
5,A Thanksgiving Tradition,"I made sure this year to have on hand before Thanksgiving, I can't wait to share it with the family, who won't admit it, but feel the same way!"
3,"What, No Perry Como?","The quintessential Thanksgiving scene in my opinion was in Barry Levinson's ""Avalon"". The family patriarch carves the Thanksgiving turkey before his late arriving brother and his family come to dinner. When the brother arrives he is irate at such insolence and not only leaves but the two would never speak for the rest of their lives. What Levinson achieves in this singular moment is not even suggested in 103 minutes of ""Home for the Holidays"". It's not that director Jodie Foster doesn't try. She manages to keep things interesting and gets the most out of her talented ensemble cast. I will add, though, that Robert Downey Jr.'s gay brother is a cliched staple of films of this type. The problem here is W.D. Richter's script which is a little thin. Foster has to get mileage out of the Thanksgiving dinner scene which is fair-to-middling and a closing montage filmed in home movie stock. Foster's film is not a bad one in the least just a very average and ultimately forgettable one."
2,Only mildly amusing; missed its potential...,"The subject matter is there, the talent is there, but this film sorely disappointed me when it came out. The audience doesn't need to hear Holly Hunter moaning about her dread of her visit home for the first 15 minutes - anyone who has spent Thanksgiving with family already knows the feeling! Meanwhile, the family was also a bit TOO over the top, a dash of subtlety and downplay of their eccentric behavior would have done wonders. The turkey scene at the end was just too much for me; I expected more from Jodie Foster's more than capable hands."
1,No English subtitles,"Its about time people started recognizing the need for English subtitles. This movie sounds exactly like the sort of thing I would enjoy, but without the subtitles, I am lost."
4,....but I ALREADY know the story !,"Can some of the people who've written a review please rate the DVD itself? I don't need to know the plot, or which part is the funniest, or how good the cast is....I already know all of these things! I'd like to buy this movie, but if the video transfer is second-rate, or the audio is difficult in some places, etc., etc. Doesn't anyone out there have an opinion on how good (or bad) the DVD itself is ? It would be appreciated !!"
5,classic movies,Love disfunctional families ...Classic movies with a twist that all come from love. Great acting and humor. with a holiday thems...
4,Dysfunctional Family at its best,"C'mon, your family's Thanksgiving couldn't possibly be this bad, could it? It's a poignent look at the pain and love families commit on and to one another. Laughter and tears almost guarenteed."
5,The Bluest Eyes in Texas,"Goodness, I liked this book a lot. There were spots where the book lagged and the characters didn't shine like they should, but guess what...this is what happens in real life.The plot was good, character development was good and the ending was great.Nice debut novel!"
2,she does move the story alone,"For a first timer, she does move the story alone, but unfortunately, it drags in places and has a definite already known ending. The story line is somewhat weak with the lawyer being attracted to of course, the opposite of herself. The writer throws in a trip to the fair to spruce things up, but that isn't enough. The misadventures in the lovers office is a little confusing. Overall, I enjoyed the book, as there were definite well written scenes, and nicely worded background of the two women. Reason for the 2 star, it was somewhat choppy and very predictible. I don't like it when I know the outcome of a book and where the author is leading me. I will buy her next book, and hopefully that effort will keep me a little more in suspense."
5,My Best Christmas Gift,"This book was the best Christmas gift given to me. I have read and enjoyed Ms. Crist's Xena and Gabrielle stories and the web version of this book. The published version is even better; the plot tighter, the editing well done. I enjoyed the exciting legal mystery that is the central plot of this book, and the warm love story that develops very naturally and believably between Carson and Kennedy. It was a lot of fun to read about places in Texas too. I believe Ms. Crist is getting ready to start writing the sequel and I can hardly wait to read it."
5,Entertaining,"I thought Linda Crist did a wonderful job in getting me to care about what happened to her characters, Carson and Kennedy, in The Bluest Eyes in Texas. I particularly appreciated the fact that there was an interesting mystery that went along with the girl meets girl story. Ms. Crist's skill with writing dialogue that rigns true and her use of Texas as a locale made the story more enjoyable for me. I hope there are more books in this author's future."
3,Companion Workbook,"This is not meant to be a ""stand alone"" workbook. It seems to be intended to be used to support a class or seminar. The ad is not clear on this."
5,"Why Do ""They"" Do It?","As someone who makes his living because of the existence of casinos I am always struck by the fact that some people just can't stop gambling. They would rather lose all their money and some would rather lose everything they have in life as long as they can play the games.Now I don't think compulsive gamblers are any different than other addictive types. I knew someone who was told by his doctor that he was going to die - because he was running too much. The runner had thoroughly devastated his body and bled everytime he urinated.The addicted will always be with us. This book addresses how to help them, if they can be helped. There is definitley something in the brain and in the personality that causes people to do the destructable.Frank Scoblete: author of Golden Touch Blackjack Revolution! and Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution!"
5,Excellent ... HDTV,"It is very good, takes good pictures is super original finish and is backed by LG"
3,Opposite does attract,"This was definitely a love story in the 90's. It was just the right stuff, it demostrated that opposite's does attract. Jazmine was a woman of style be was also very influencing on such a stereotype hard core black male. He knew the street life well, it was his background, but a soft yet tender ""RONI"" comes along a rocks his world. Even though things were rocky toward the end, when it was all over you knew that they would be together. This novel was interesting but ""Lil'Mama's Rule "" and ""Blessings"" were the best."
5,keepin it real,The book was very good because she kept it real throughout the book. she compared alot of things towards life as it is now.
1,Terrible!!!!!,The worst book I've ever read. The woman has no talent whatsoever. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. I've read kindergarden books with more intelligence than Jackson.
5,Held my attention the whole way through!,"I began ""Caught up in the Rapture"" on a Friday and finishedreading it Monday morning while riding BART to work.I think that Shaneska has great writing talent and I lookforward to reading more of her work. I really loved Jasmineand Xavier. This was a very exciting relationship becauseit was not the normal Harlequin romance stuff. This wasthe real every day type relationship that I couldtotally relate to and understand. Their relationship showedthat if the love is real, it definitely can conquer all.I have since passed the book along to 3 other people wholiked it so much, they wanted to purchase their own copies.Thank you for letting me express my opinion.Traci L. Lee"
3,Caught Up Into Too Much Cursing,"Oh boy! Don't get me wrong. I'm all for keeping it real but ""Caught Up In the Rapture"" was a lil bit too real for me. The storyline is great but the language and the style used to tell the story wasn't all that hot. I didn't care about the character ""X-man"" enough to know what happens to him. I liked Jazmine's character but the story didn't move me enough to even finish it, so I never know what happened in the end. Sheneska is a great writer, but this story just left me empty."
5,Exciting,Sheneska is a true soul sistah!!! Her characters were so real I thought that I actually knew them. The plot was thick and I was in total shock towards the conclusion of this novel. I definitely couldn't put this book down. I read it in 4 days.
3,Young Adult Novel,"This si a good young adult novel. It does have some foul language, but it is a decent love story"
2,Terry McMillan - she is not!,"This is an average dud. The story line is easy to follow, but the story itself stinks.I read it once, but won't be reading it again."
5,The great pain written about in a delicate and subtle way,"Nelly Sachs writes about the most painful subject the losses of the Shoah in a delicate and subtle way. She does not have the kind of complexity or dimension of her co- Nobel Prize winner Agnon, but she has a voice and a language truly her own."
4,English country life at the hands of a master,"A tongue in cheek, close-up look at the manners and mores of country life in England in the '30s. A modern-day Jane Austin, nothing much happens in any of her books, other than a marriage or christening. Sly, humourous and wittily observed - a perfect intro to the world of Barsetshire."
4,I just like to have this movie.,I don't like justifying my desires to you. I'm sure whatever I write here will go for waste. What meaning would my words here carry with them? Who will read this?
5,Heartland movie DVD,"I have been looking for this movie for several years on an economical DVD, and found it here. It was a good service."
3,Interesting Story,"When we first saw this movie years ago, I would have given it 1 star. But, as I have grown older, I appreciate the deeper messages more. Not a great movie but pretty pretty decent."
4,Just fun,"If you like the old black and white TV cop shows, this is your book. If you didn't experience these treasurers, you'll get a taste in the books of Ed McBain. Before you buy any of his books, read his biography on Amazon. He was an interesting writer who had an impact on police procedure books and cop mysteries."
4,"Review of ""Fuzz""",Quick moving and great descriptions of events and other related actions. Another good book by McBaine. He is always good.
3,So so,This book was no great shakes. I would probably read another book by this author to see if there is a trend.
4,More fuzz,"I had pleasure reading this book. The protagonists are interresting and the ryhtm is good. Funny, well written. The story is good and well organised."
4,Police Fiction,"I enjoyed this book, reminded me of NYPD Blue television series. This was my first Ed McBain book and I will purchase more for my Kindle. What i didn't know when I got this one was, it's #22 in the 87th Precinct series. It didn't ruin anything for me except I know of one character who was involved in previous books and got away from the police. Otherwise, I think you could probably read them out of order. (Off to get book 1 though)"
3,Low-quality Kindle version,"The story is fine.The e-book is not: it's pretty obviously an OCRed version with insufficient proofreading (missing or incorrect punctuation, typos)."
5,Do you like waffels?,"Seriously, this cd just made me laugh and laugh and laugh, love it. I wasn't expecting what I got, its basically a CD on generic to-be-used commercial jingles... kinda like a pre-sell-out sell-out"
5,We Love Barney,This was a great purchase. The kids enjoy it and I will continue to recommend it to family and friends.
3,"cheap price, but cheaply made","the shirt arrived with a side seam split open. oh, what the heck, I put tape on it from the inside to make it work for one night. it looked pretty good after I got it all on, and I might even get another use out of it sometime in the future. all in all not terrible for a one night costume, and a lot easier than running around town to find something similar."
3,"Good, but could be better","This book is easy to read. However, if you are wanting a book that has everything to get up and running on SMS 2003, this book is lacking. Make sure to read the product's release notes. If you have access to Microsoft TechNet and Microsoft's website, you will need it to do some homework. The Advanced Security model in SMS 2003 is definitely far different from previous versions of SMS. The book does not go into any of this in detail. I recommend this book, but make sure you collect up the other information I have mentioned."
1,Not for Beginners,This book is wriiten with the expectation that you have working experience with SMS.
4,Clearly defines purposes and goals of the SMS 2003,"This is quite a voluminous book, with lots of screenshots and textual information. It defines clearly the purposes and goals of the Microsoft Systems Management Server 2003 software, explains fairly well why to use it and how to deploy it. If you didn't hear what SMS is and did never work with it before, this published work is of great value. However, when in comes to troubles with the use or the deployment of the software, this volume is of little worth. It does only explain the straight path when everything goes fine, but as soon as something went wrong, you are lost."
4,Good general info,"This is a good reference for general SMS admin tasks but not a good source for troubleshooting in-depth issues or uncommon configurations. Comes with an eval version of SMS 2003 - I would rather see them include some web reporting templates or queries, admin scripts, etc.."
5,Another hurray for Lavyrle !,"I couldnt put it down! I am an avid fan of L.S. and this has to be one of my new favorites. Separate Beds being my all time favorite book. This story only got better the deeper into the book you got. The way the characters respond to their feelings seems less contrived than a lot of the typical romances you will read. The closer you get to the finale, the better it gets! It has a suspense that reams you deeper into the story. A must read for anyone who loves a good story and likes to ride the wave of emotions only Lavyrle can put you on. READ IT !"
5,"Please, pretty please come out of retirement!","I have read, reread, and read this book some more. It is one of my all time favorites! I recommend it to anyone and everyone that asks and even some that don't. It is the most read book in my home. I own almost everything written by LaVyrle. I cried the day she retired! Come on LaVyrle--just one more!"
4,Not Her Best But It's Still Good!,Lavyrle Spencer is one of my favorite writers and while I don't think of Vows as being her best book and I didn't hold on to it for my keeper shelf I did think it was a pretty good book full of good characters like Emily and Tom and Emily's family and friends but I do agree that her dorky friend Tarsi was very annoying. I would recommend Vows to fans of Lavryle Spencer who haven't read the book. I actually listened to the audio cassette which was read by Mary Crosby and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to listen to audio books. BTW: Mary Crosby is an actress and she played Kristen on Dallas and she is also the daughter of singer/actor Bing Crosby.
3,Not one of her better novels,"Yes, the romance is steamy between Emily and Tom. Yes, there is the angst-filled torment for the lovers which can be headily enjoyable. Sure there are complications in the forms of fiancees, family obligations, and lack of support from friends and family, but I found that the story was rather predictable and the characters not terribly strong. I would recommend this book to die-hard Spencer fans and certainly not as an introduction to the author."
4,Spencer doesn't disappoint,Another great book by LaVyrle Spencer. Heart-warming and beautifully written. Wish she would. Come out of retirement! She's one of the best at well researched romance novels
3,Pasta Girl,I did not enjoy this book as much as others this author has written.I skimmed over the sex as I found it boring.Have another of her books on my Kindle. Haven't had a chance to read it.
5,Excelente tarjeta,Excelente la respuesta en lectura y escritura de esta tarjeta. Funciona perfectamente bien con mi Nikon D60
3,Lots of pretty pictures but light on recommendations,"The main reason why I buy these guides is for the recommendations (i.e. how to get from point A to point B, which hotels are best, etc.) Though this book provides a few pages of recommendations, it is more of a picture book on NYC. I agree that it will be a great souvenir and tells a lot of great little facts about buildings in the city. For something more practical (and less expensive), I recommend getting a NYC map and checking out the NYC tourist sites on the web."
4,good primer,"DK's guide is a comprehensive, full-color pictorial (it reminds me of a glossy travel brochure) showing you the sights of the city while providing you with a wealth of helpful information. The book covers churches, museums, NYC history, famous buildings, restaurants, and more. There are a ton of photos, maps, and graphics, but the text is most often polished one-line blurbs containing the barest of details. It is a good primer to NYC, though, and for those pressed with time, you may find the top ten lists, and suggested walks extremely useful.Also check out the City Secrets New York City guide to discover the hidden gems of New York City. It's a great guide for saavy travelers, and NYC residents. rkchin. rkchin. http://www.nychinatown.org"
2,May Not Be The Best For Beginners,I bought this book feeling that it would take the mystery out of scanning. It did not. The problem is that that the autor uses terminolgy that is never referenced in your run of the mill scanner manual. The author talks about SPI and other terms but my scanner manual only references dpi. This book will be a disapointment to those trying to gain some basic knowledge of how to scan.
3,"This book is not only for women, nor only for heterosexuals.","I have just bought and begun reading this text yesterday (28 August), where I live in Barcelona, Spain. The book ""Getting to Commitment"" had been recommended by a psychoanalyst friend (female), who thought I would recognize myself in my relationship patterns with my last two partners (male-male relationships). That book wasn't available until next week here in Barcelona, so I took ""Men Who Can't Love"". My friend was right about the recognition. Not only do I recognize my taking on the animus role in the relationships, but also I can detect my own subtle ""male fear of commitment"" as a provoking element in the constant distancing and withdrawing of my partner. Psychological programming is certainly not limited to male-female sex/social roles, and I'm looking forward to getting a copy of the book originally recommended, through this book service."
5,Commitment issues Unveiled,"I am a professional therapist and I found this book to be easy reading and instructive for those caught in dead end relationships. It described the beginning, middle and end phases of this type of relationship, with excellent suggestions for actions the partner can take, as well as how to avoid this type of romance in the future."
4,Men Who Can't Love,"I would suggest this book to anyone who has lost their partner for no explainable reason. While my partner did not fit the examples 100%, he certainly fell into the commitmentphobic catagory. I also did many of the things the other women did to try to ""fix"" it, which only made it worse. (I wish I could have read this book before trying to fix things!) This book answered so many of my questions and is making the pain a little more bearable.The book is very well written and easy to understand, but it would have been nice to see a chapter on 'how' they became that way (i.e. divorce, widowed, fear of losing again, upbringing)."
5,This book saved me,"While searching for a book that would tell me how to get over my impending break-up with the commitmentphobic man I had been with for two years, I came across Men Who Can't Love. After thumbing through it I bought it, took it home and read it in two days. I even take it to work with me like a security blanket. When I got pangs of missing ""him"", I looked at all the passages I had highlighted and pages I had dog-eared and I am reminded of all this book taught me. I am going to start it again tomorrow. This book is a true god-send for anyone going through rough times with a commitmentphobic. My favorite book of all times! It is helping to heal me."
5,Worst case scenerio,"Now that I've read MEN WHO CAN'T LOVE, I feel I have the best example of this bizarre behavior! I spent 5 years with my comittmentphobic, we are both 35 years old. We constantly broke up and got back together(yes, I believed the promises). During the last time, I was convinced we would be together forever. He was suddenly diagnosed with Leukemia, given 15 days to live, or a 30% chance of survival with Chemotherapy. I gave up my life for 6 months, and we fought through the illness together. After an 80 pound weight loss and a near death experience, his cancer was in remission. We had a new chance at life! We were home for a week when he left, without a word, for another woman. I thank Steven Carter and Julia Sokol for explaining to me why and helping me realize that I am better than him. I thank them for lifting the weight that I've carried on my shoulders for too long, and giving me a positive path to follow."
1,Men who can't love,"How come ALL of the reviews are by poor defenseless victim women? Nothing in this book tells us the QUALIFICATIONS of the authors. Is she a lesbian? Is a castrated male? Neither are licensed psychologists. So they interviewed some weak and destroyed women who LET IT HAPPEN. Sorry guys, I'm just not buying it. If there was at least a line or two about the women having some adult personal responsibility, I might be able to buy parts of it, but it just gives all the helpless victim females an excuse and a free out. AS the abused male who wasa never accepted and constantly torn down and told how I should be to be good enough, I prefer Lousie Hay, PhD ""You can heal your life"". We are ALL perfect as we are. Sorry ladies, I mean victims, grow up and stop ball busting your men, and maybe they won't leave you."
5,Excellent in helping to identify commitment-phobia,"This was an excellent book that really helped me to understand that the person whom I loved was a true commitment-phobic. Certain behaviors that I considered strange were identified specifically in the book. These included peculiar telephone behavior, putting boundaries on the relationship, and also giving lots of mixed signals. Real-life stories from people who were interviewed for the book were provided, and some of them were very interesting. A few of them were downright bizarre! The author was once a commitment-phobic and explained the thought processes from that point of view, and he also explained what a ""normal"" person would feel and think. Specific strategies were provided to cope with a person who has this fear. In the end, the book made me feel much better about the whole situation I had just lived through, and the real-life examples supported the theories brought forth by the author."
3,Informative but doesn't go far enough,This book contains good examples of non-committal behaviour but it doesn't examine why some men are more commitmentphobic than others. And by reading this and the numerous examples you might get the feeling that finding a man who's willing to stay for the long haul is hopeless.What the book does do is reinforce the notion that if your partner isn't willing to commit it has nothing to do with you. And the bottom line is to just to move on.
2,yuk,"I really found this book to be useless. I never did find out why men can't commit but lots of stories about how men don't commit. No real information, no real depth into the psychology of men. Useless."
4,Relationships don't happen in 4 months,"A good read but I don't like the title. Afraid to love would be better. Everyone has issues from the past to deal with and should be made known and dealt with. Too often people don't know the person they marry. You never had time to be friends. The most you knew about him was all the good stuff he told you. The term commitment phobe is cute but unheard of until recently. Maybe guys become scared because females are so eager to jump into marriage like it is some kind of trophy. Maybe the guy isn't as afraid of commitment as he is afraid that sex is all you have to offer, or you just want to tap into his wallet."
3,Didn't do a whole lot for me...,"...after 50 attempts to sit down and read it all the way through. It never ""grabbed"" me."
4,Every woman must read this book,"Having just been through this experience, I was amazed at how many of the behaviors described in the book were exactly as I had experienced them (his and mine). The book helped me to understand that the failure of the relationship was not my fault, and that it IS over."
5,Every Woman Should Read This!,"If there was one book I would say to read, it would be this book right here... It is an amazing book, and I swear it had to be written on the basis of my once-relationship... I have learned a lot though the pages of Men Who Can't Love. Not only how to spot a commitmentphobic, but how to protect myself from the hurt I have been caused. It has also REALLY helped me begin to mend my broken heart and shattered dreams... This, again, is a must read!!!"
5,Great book!,"This book is excellent! Any woman who has suffered at the hands of a commitmentphobe will benefit greatly. Great book at building your self-esteem and realizing it is them, not you, and how to never get involved with this type of guy again. Wonderful advice and tips on how to spot one of these types."
5,UNBELIEVABLE INSIGHT FOR RELATIONSHIP PAIN/RECOVERY,"Very empowering and ""real-life"". I can't emphasize enough how well these authors did their research and how they have brought so much clarity to the baffling behavior of committment-phobic partners. I thought I was way too smart and way to independent to ever be helped by this kind of information. Wrong. I wish I had read it so much sooner. If your pain and confusion has lasted too long, read this book before you spend $$$ on therapy. It honors your experience, lets you see (shockingly) that you are far from being alone, and speaks volumes to the confusion and sadness you feel. The internal strength and confidence you had will re-emerge."
5,Life-Saving,"After my long term boyfriend sent me my favorite flowers and a letter breaking up with me out of nowhere, I knew I had to do something to help me through it. I was completely devastated. I ordered this book and it is excellent! I recommend it for anyone who has been through an ""out of the blue"" break-up and doesn't understand what happened. This book most importantly teaches you that it wasn't your fault...he's the one with the problem! What a relief that was after I was feeling that I was somehow ""unloveable."" These men are terrified of commitment and the better a relatioship is, the faster they run from it."
3,Try before you buy,"Watch out for a manufacturing error with this 2CD set. I found that the exact same music (Concertos 4-6) was recorded on each CD in the set (they are labelled CD1 and CD2 but both contain the music for CD2). I returned it, obtained a replacement, and the replacement has the exact same problem, so it is not an isolated event. I believe these performances would be excellent if I could only get to hear them all."
2,Production Error,"I would like to confirm the problem reported by Mr. Whittet. I purchased the disks in November 2005 and found the same mistake that he did. Disk 1 has the same music as Disk 2.In other ways this is a spectacular recording. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment gives a graceful and articulate reading of the concertos, and the recorded sound is clear, warm, and spacious. But, despite the bargain price, it's not worth it just to get two copies of concertos 4-6."
5,Fantastic Litter - Slightly larger pellets than Feline Pine,"I like this litter better than Feline Pine (which I have used for years with 5 cat household). The difference is that the pellets are larger. This prevents less tracking.The paper packaging sometimes succumbs to shipping problems and occasionally breaks. But not too often. The packaging is natural like the litter (no plastic). Nature's Logic is a good company and environmentally conscious. That is encouraging.This litter is a great natural alternative to clay, really kills urine odors and is economical."
2,2 Songs are Cut Off Right in the Middle,What is here is really good but there are 2 songs (El Condor Pasa and Goodbye My Love) that are cut off right in the middle and it totally ruins the listening experience. It's a shame that they really ruined the flow of this - should have been great. And all of the songs are live except one song - the second one (Crying In The Rain with James Taylor) which also totally ruins any continuity or flow. Why would they do this??? If they wanted this song on here (and it is not very good) they should have put it at the end or better yet just left it off and put on the full versions of El Condor Pasa and Goodbye My Love!
4,Power to the Music,"Checked Killing Season out on MP3.com about 6 months ago. I have to say I was very impressed and look forward to getting my copy of the album. It has an 80s feel but in my opinion a very modern production. Its somewhere a cross between White Zombie and Bon Jovi. Weird combination I'll admit but I really liked what I heard. The lyrics to one of the songs I heard, breath in my skin, gives me chills everytime I listen to the song. Powerful and deep. It is definitely better than what my radio stations play on a daily basis. Plus the guys are really cute so that helps, its nice to have a band that looks as good as they sound it's a quality that is sadly missed."
4,princess diaries cd,"This CD has a great selection of music on it-I especially love it for when driving to work. They were great at sending it quickly, and it plays pretty well for a used cd."
3,"Ok, But could have been better","The first song, I guess you could call that the ""theme song"" I really like. Supergirl has a pop beat and wonderful harmony. It's really cool. Pretty Girl is a biter of some commericial anthem that I can't really think about the name right now, but if you listen to the background music you will know what I'm talking about. That was pretty horrible. Sounds like cats screaming. The others are ok I guess. Nothing really stands out that much."
2,Only 1 Song is Worthwhile...,"I would never have purchased this soundtrack if it hadn't been for a burning curiousity to hear Hanson's ""Wake Up."" After listening to ""Wake Up"", which is a terrific song,I decided to give the other songs a chance. That was a big mistake- every other song on the soundtrack is either incredibly stupid (Itty Bitty Pretty One, Stupid Cupid) or just mindless bubblegum pop by second rate artists. There is nothing unique about the overwhelming majority of this soundtrack, but it was still worth just to hear ""Wake Up."" :-)"
2,~*~*It'S oK i GuEsS. . .*~*~,"{This really should be 2 1/2 stars, but whatever...}Well, let me just say first that I have nothing against the movie, ""The Princess Diaries."" Actually, the only reason I got this soundtrack is because I liked the movie so much, I thought the soundtrack would be just as cool. See right after my dad took us to the theater, we went to umm I forget which store because he had to get something so I bought the CD. I was happy to get it, but then I went home & listened to it...yucky. My neighbor has it too and she thought it was great, so I listened to it some more to see if maybe it'd grow on me. That never happened. Maybe you will like this CD, but for me...it ain't gonna cut it. =P"
4,A Princess of a CD,"I bought Priness Diaries the morning of it's release on 7/24/01. I can't say I'm a fan of this type of music. But I found it enjoyable after all. Particularly Supergirl.Now a confession as to why I bought the CD in the first place, if I didn't care for that kind of music. TRUTH.... I'm a great admirer of Julie Andrews. And even though she doesn't sing on it.....It has a great picture of her on the cover."
3,what an ugly song sung by the one who can't sing.,"This album is not too bad. All the songs are good. I gave 5 stars to this album at first. But after I listened to the song that by ..., Aaron Carter, I put the 2 stars back. I can't believe the 14-year-old boy sang it like that. When I compare this version with the Billy Gilman version, I just want to say Billy is 14 also. Why did he sing the same song greater than the one who released his album in 1998. ..."
2,Good for one song...,"To tell you the truth, I bought this album for one song ""Wake Up"" by Hanson. And it turns out, that is the only thing to be excited about. The rest of the album is bland pop such as a cover of ""Stupid Cupid"" by Mandy Moore and other such sticky-sweet pop. So really, unless you're a big Hanson fan, don't buy the album."
2,"HANSON, AND THATS IT.",i bought this cd for the hanson song just like everyone else has appeared to...and im going to say the same thing. Hanson is the only thing on that entire cd worth listening to. a ton of rediculous pop songs with cheesy lyrics and the same bad melodies of brittany spears and nsync's terrible songwriters.
3,"sorry, only ONE good song","I actually heard this whole CD when I borrowed it from my sister, and I was disappointed. It's great if you're really into pop and stuff, but I'm totally not. To me, the songs were too teeny-boppish. The one good song was ""WAKE UP"" by Hanson, which was awesome. Their music has matured so much; everyone really needs to give them a listen. They have a new album out, check it out!"
3,ideal for yound children,"I'm not a huge fan of this cd, there is a lot of bubblegum pop which I'm sure will appeal to children. I bought the cd because of the song ""Miracles Happen"", what can I say? I really like that song even though I'm an adult."
3,**Umm.. young teens only please**,"Talk about teenybopper! Now don't get me wrong, some of the songs are amazing. I just have to say I hate that stupid, irritating song ""I love life"" by Melissa Lefton. It would have been such a good song if she didn't add all that dumb stuff about her chicken dinner and whatever.. it made no sense. I just have to vent about how much I hate that song. The soundtrack is wonderful as long as you skip the Melissa Lefton song (gag)"
5,wowie,This a AWESOME cd! I love this cd it makes you start to wiggle until you end up on your feet danceing I love mabey my favorites are happy go lucky I love life hold on and stupid cupid
2,Good songs but...,"This CD is not Mac friendly. Not only can you NOT play the enhanced part of the CD, but you cannot even play the sound part either. If you have a Mac, this CD is no good."
3,Good music but...,"The song ""Stupid Cupid"" was not written for Mandy Moore. It is her cover version of an old song from the 60s. Was a cute little song then and is still a cute little song, but was not written for her. I figure the only reason it was in the movie was so that her fans would get their money's worth if they came to see the movie because she was in it. It doesn't add anything to the film in any way. Otherwise the sound track is pretty good."
5,It is AWESOME!,"Well all of the songs (except I'm not a big Backstreet Boy fan. I don't know what it is about them. It's probably that they dance around like little cheerleaders, and don't play thier own instruments.) are good but I have two that I like most. I like Supergirl because she can really sing, and she plays the piano. I love the piano in songs. And my MOST favorite is Wake Up by Hanson. These guys are the best band in the world! I have been a fan since '97. (and they play their own instruments! lol) I have to give major props to these guys after all the hard work they've been through!"
4,Need to bop?,"My daughter and I got this soundtrack for something upbeat to hear while panting on the treadmill. Need something new to listen to while you sweat? All the tracks may not be the perfect beat, but almost all are very upbeat and have inspired us to go just a little longer on the old TM. We skip the rap track, but overall it's a great soundtrack for sweating."
5,Amelia Krammer,"This soundtrack is so gr8!! I love all of the songs on it. By just listening to it for a few minutes, you will be on the dance floor dancing in no time. I think this is a great choice to give a pop start to you collection."
2,great listening,Nice listening and partying music from a seemingly low-brow but funny and wise movie.
5,Miracles DO Happen!,"The highlight of this CD is Myra's ""Miracles Happen."" She's a sweet girl with a great voice. I suggest you all check her out and get her own CD!"
2,Only good song is Hanson's!,"If you like Pop music, you'll like this CD, but I don't really care too much for pop music. I, along with many other Hanson fans bought this for Hanson's brand new song ""Wake Up"" which is truely amazing and itz the best song on that whole CD. So if you decide to buy it, skip all the others and go right to track #10 and prepare to be amazed, but don't let the ""do do dah's"" scare you :o)"
2,"The movie was GREAT, the soundtrack I can't say the same for","The movie was awesome, I liked it. The soundtrack... on the other hand.The songs aren't that great. Most of them are overplayed pop songs. It is filled with Backstreet, Mandy and Aaron Carter.Honestly, I bought the soundtrack for ONE song... ""Wake Up"" by Hanson. There are a couple other good songs, namely ""Miss You More"" by BBMak and ""Supergirl"" by Krystal.Other than that, unless you are all out on the pop scene, I'm telling you to buy a different CD."
4,"Very Good, Underrated Re-Make","This movie, a re-make of Shirley Temple's ""Little Miss Marker"" gets little respect from the national critics. As usual, I disagree with them: this is fun movie and one you should enjoy if you like Temple and laugh at Bob Hope's jokes.I didn't always think Hope was funny but this movie had a lot of laughs, a great story and a cute kid. It isn't as hokey or dated as most of Hope's films and some of his lines in here are downright clever.Mary Jane Saunders does a nice imitation of Temple-Margaret O'Brien, a combination of those two child stars. You also get Lucille Ball in here, although she's just okay, nothing hilarious. She does get some good wise-cracks in, however.This is a solid, underrated comedy. I'm sorry to see I am only the fourth person to review this film here at Amazon. A lot of people are missing out on a funny movie."
3,"rent, dont buy","Blades of Glory is funny the first time around, but isn't worth owning or watching more than twice. If you want to see Will Farrell at his best you're better off buying Zoolander, and for Jon Heder stick with Napoleon Dynamite (which is more of a social statement than a comedy).Long story short, rent Blades of Glory but no need to own it."
3,good enough,these two guys work good enough together to make the movie funny in a snl kind of funny.
3,Comedy on blades,A few laughs. Good video and audio transfer. A decent story with good and interesting characters.
2,ugh,"This movie did have it's funny moments, but it was the same humor throughout and most of it was all done with actions, never laughed at a line, the dialouge wasn't very good. this is worth a rent, not a buy."
2,it was aight,"this film was slightly better than average but while it had some good silly parts, the story line was all over the place. I got where they were trying to go with it,but it left alot of things kinda hanging. WIll Ferrell is good. he has a way of doing what he does and making it work. Jon Heder is ok,but he just pretty much plays the same role. the Brother and Sister team were a trip though. a few decent laughs,but the film was just kinda there in the end."
3,Not ferrell's best,"First a disclaimer -- will, if you're out there reading this, just know that I LOVE YOU MAN!Disclaimer aside, this is not one of ferrell's best. In other words, categorize this with anchor man versus Old School, Talladega Nights & his unforgettable cameo in Wedding Crashers. Blades is more like one of those Saturday Night Live skits that has a kernel of a good idea but just doesn't work.Of course, any ferrell movie has to go thru the ferrell filter: if you are not a big ferrell fan, you will wish you waited for the rental on this. if you're a diehard ferrell fan, like me, who would laugh watching ferrell make a PBJ, you will want to catch this in the theater."
1,Lowest common denominator,"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies (I won't even refer to it as a film) I've ever tried to watch. We could only get through the first few minutes before we had to turn it off. If this is the best Will Ferrell can do, he really should give up.Honestly, if Will Ferrell was offered a great film role but there was a restriction of ""no sexual jokes"" he'd have to turn down the role. Sexual humor is is only ""talent"". It gets really old.Watch something decent or read a book ... don't waste your time on something as lame as this."
1,Um .... no.,"I've never been a fan of Will Ferrell and his single-note performance that gets repeated from movie to movie. Several people recommended this movie ""Even if you don't like Will Ferrell.""I didn't like the movie. The only thing that saved it from one star was the fun it poked at the overly pretentious world of figure skating. Beyond that ... lame plot, poor dialog, cartoonish character development, and simply ridiculous ending just dragged this movie down.Save yourself some wasted time. Put ""Blades of Glory"" on ice and watch something else."
4,Funny movie,"Someone told me, o my god you haven't seen blades of Glory yet? Right then i just ordered it from my phone on Amazon's App since it was only 5 bucks. It was funny, and i love Will F. Don't pay for than 5 for it though, it's not a show stopper."
4,purdy danged funny,Will Farrell and John Heder are too danged funny in this pic. Great entertainment if you just want a good laugh!
3,Blades of Glory review,"If you like Will Ferrell or Jon Heder, it's worth seeing this movie. It's at least as good as Talladega Nights, but it's not as funny as Anchorman. Heder plays his typical dweeby character, while Ferrell doesn't yell quite as much as he usually does, but still comes off very funny."
5,The film ain't great but five stars for all the drama!!,"Way to go, Paramount! Now if we can just get Warner Brothers to come to the good side....whew. Everybody whining on these boards about HD-DVD only...if you could afford an over-priced Blu-Ray player, you can easily pony up for an HD-DVD player...under $250 on this very site"
1,"Good Movie, poor decisions","I loved this movie in the theaters, but I'm infuriated by Paramount's decision to take this title away from Blu-ray. The release date was already announced for Blu-ray and two weeks before the release, they take it off? That's ridiculous! Blu-ray discs are outselling HD-DVD 2-1! I'm officially boycotting Paramount titles, it appears they don't want my money.PS For you HD DVD fans posting negative comments on this page, congrats, you've just spent money on losing format. Long live Blu-ray!"
1,Why should the customer have to decide?,"It's funny to read all these reviews, as I also prefer Blu-ray, because it only makes sense to me to choose the format that offers MORE space ... because HD needs a lot of room.But the crying shame in all of this is why the heck are there Two formatsto begin with? It would of been a lot simpler for us all if all these companies could of put their differences aside, and merged the technologies to give us just ONE great HD medium. But NO ... It's Beta & VHS all over again.So my hope is that the upcoming Dual-Player from Samsung will be reasonably priced, as the $1000 LG just doesn't make sense. Heck, you can buy both HD-DVD, & Blu-ray players for quite a bit less.The bottom line is that HD titles can really look awesome compared to regular DVD. Whichever one you choose, enjoy it. Soon it all won't matter, as downloading HD content should be the next step."
3,It's Okay / Talladega Nights Was much better,"I gave this movie 3 stars because I wanted to like this movie. Will Ferrell needs to stop making these sport movies. They are looking the same. If you saw Talladega Nights than you have seen this movie already. Just that Talladega Nights was so much better. I'm gald we just reneted this movie because we were so disappointed in it. We've followed Ferrell's carrer from SNL, Old School, Stranger than Fiction, etc. So it's not like we don't like him. I recommend renting this if you do the deleivering to the house rentals, if not save your money."
3,surprisingly good!,"I like Will Farrell in small doses and wasn't sure I wanted to watch this. I thought it would make me really never want to watch another one of his movies again... but then I bought this as a gift for my sister and watched it with her ROTFLMAO they did a very good job with this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised at how well put together it was and how not completely sucky it was hahaha Jon Heder's drier funny works very well with Farrell's outlandish funny, which was something else that I didn't expect. Plus, Will Arnett and that SNL chick (she's really funny, I'm just drawing a blank on her name) are absolutely hilarious together. I wouldn't spend the money to buy it at full price; but if it ever ends up in the discount bin, I'd buy it for sure."
2,I love Will... But....,"I love Will but i found this movie to be poor. It was just not that funny. Amusing yes, worth a 99 cent download maybe... but not one of his better works."
2,:(,"I don't know what happened to Will Ferrell but he is NOT funny anymore (maybe only in ""Old school""). And this movie was #1 at the box office for two weeks???? WHY ????"
5,Love Will,"What a great movie. So darn funny. I watch movies first before I let the kids watch them. There were some areas where I did cover my youngest daughters eyes, but after that, the whole family loved it. There's some things she doesn't need to see yet. This being expected, the whole family laughed like crazy with this one."
3,If only you're in a good mood...,"This movie is full of campy and cheesy humor but somehow doesn't make you want to turn it off. I think Jon Heder was very good in the film; his character is very unsettled. If you liked Dodgeball, you might like this film though this one tries harder. However, the overall plot is a bit too ""American Summer Comedy film"" 'ish to be considered extraordinary. This is the sort of movie where you get what the trailer promises. Will Ferrell is very talented. If you're in a good mood with the right company, this is for you. Otherwise, forget about it, don't waste your hard earned weekend, much rather watch Seinfeld at home. Good action, though. I thought the funniest scene in the film was when Jon Heder walks into Ferrell cupping the lady's [...].PS - The music is in the film is a major downer"
5,Excellent Video Quality,This review is for those of you who already know this is a great movie...but are considering upgrading from a DVD to this Blu Ray for an expected boost in video quality.The video quality is fantastic and consistent throughout the movie (tested on a 60 inch plasma HDTV). Highly recommend.
4,Blades of Glory HD-DVD no Dolby TrueHD,"I rented this movie in HD-DVD because reviews here said it was a Dolby TrueHD title, but there was no Dolby TrueHD audio selection available, only Dolby Digital Plus 5.1."
2,30 minutes' worth of humor stretched out for 90 minutes,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it fell flat for me. Everything seemed very formulaic and predictable. Will Ferrell played his usual clueless-but-cocky character, and Jon Heder seemed out of his league as Ferrell's rival (and eventual partner). Some of the physical humor was mirth-provoking, but the off-the-ice scenes seemed labored. The highlight of the movie, for me, was the brother and sister team played by real-life spouses Will Arnett and Amy Poehler. I'd give this movie 2.5 stars if Amazon allowed that. I'm going with 2 stars to lower the average rating a bit."
1,I fell asleep,"This is the 1st time EVER I fell asleep at the cinema because a movie was so dull, and I saw ""Scenes From A Mall"" at the theater, and managed to live thru that, but this one was a snoozer. I guess I don't get why anyone finds Will ferrel funny, or why he keeps landing starring roles. The only thing I have seen him in that was remotely entertaining was ELF. Plus isn't he too old to be playing young men? He should be playing dads or grandfathers. If you think constant shots of ice-skaters staring into eachother crotches as they do maneuvers is funny, then this film is for you. The guy that played Napolean Dynamite must not have a good choice of scripts to have chosen this one."
2,Packaged poorly,"The sender mailed my DVD without its orginal DVD case. It was taped to a piece of cardboard. I haven't watched the movie yet, but wouldn't doubt that its scratched."
4,Jimmy MacElroy,"After spending an evening driving around to all of the local movie rental stores to try to find Blades of Glory, I decided it was about time to add this one to the collection. The online movie sites are generally extremely useful, however, in this situation they were useless. Despite the moment being passed that evening, it was rekindled several days later. Great movie!"
4,Great movie,"Lots of good laughs - love Will Ferrell. Kind of stupid at times, but in a funny way. I'm glad I watched it."
2,Blades of Glory,"You have got to be kidding me, this movie is somewhat funny. At times boring tho. Do not buy this blu ray for 25 dollars! This movie is maybe worth 9.99. Amazon your crazy trying to sell it for that much!!"
2,"Not funny, not well-written--just BAD","This movie is not at all as funny as many people on here are claiming. The pacing of the movie lumbers along. The storyline is just bad, and overall, this movie was not good. I am a Will Farrell fan, as is my husband, and neither of us thought this was funny. I did appreciate the cast, because it had our favorites in the film, but that's about as much as I can say for it."
5,Funnier than Talladega Nights,"Ferrell and Heder make a great comedy team and this is probably Ferrell's best comedy since Anchorman. The two leads have great chemistry and play off each other very well. I laughed more during this movie than I did at Talladega Nights (Ricky Bobby), so that should tell you something. Also, the supporting cast is amazing (Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Jenna Fischer, Craig T. Nelson, etc) and they account for a lot of the laughs themselves. Add in all the great cameos (Scott Hamilton, Nancy Kerrigan, etc) and you have one truly funny sports movie. Highly recommeded!"
4,Quite a Few Laughs,"I am not the biggest Will Ferrell fan in the world, but my fiancee suggested this movie so I kind of went along for the ride, not expecting much. I was surprised. Heder and Farrell had chemistry, and both actors made the film funny. Without Ferrell, this film would have been a disaster; he saves it by supplying his unique brand of humor. And unlike his past films, he is under a little more control here. The supporting cast (Poehler, Nelson, etc.) are pretty much duds, and thus two strong lead actors save the film. Funny in a cute sort of way, but just enough raunchy moments to satisfy the fans of Old School as well. This is not as original as Napoleon Dynamite, or as consistently funny as Old School, but there are plenty of laughs and it is worth the price of admission for sure. Four stars out of five."
3,"OK, I guess",This movie is OK for a 99 cent rental. Just wish I could rent for more than a 24 hour period. It was a stupid movie to have to sit through an entire 90 minute period. Would have preferred to break it up over a 3 night period with 3 30 minute viewings.
2,Really Bad,"Sorry, but this movie is so bad it'll make you want to turn it off. There is only one funny part, and that's not even that funny because you can tell it's fake. You can tell the whole movie is fake. And I could have done without seeing Will so undressed. Even though I love him as an actor, this was his worst movie ever."
3,"Not usually my style of humor, but it wasn't too bad!","I was happily surprised with this one. I thought I'd turn it off within the first 30 minutes because it would be too stupid. Well, it was stupid, but in the funny kind of way. Not amazing, and probably not worth watching over and over, but still better than expected."
1,Very stupid and completely unfunny,"I actually wanted to see it. I though the concept of 2 male figure skaters as a pair would be pretty funny. I was actually surprised to find it was actually quite dull. I think I literally laughed once. Will Ferrell is NOT funny, in anything so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I dont think I will be seeing anything with him from now."
1,Back off people!!!,"Wow, some people are so whinny and short-sighted. Look at this from Paramounts POV, in one fell swoop they just made more money than they would probaly of seen in three years if they stayed neutral. There is no way at current adoption rates that they would see 150 million anytime soon from BD/HD-DVD sells, so why not go for the gold? And seriously, how can any BD fan be critical of Paramount when Disney, Fox, lion's Gate, etc all pretty mucch sold their souls to Sony and the BDA? Why is it bad that a studio become exclusive to HD-DVD, but its fine when they are exclusive to BD,studios being exclusive to any format is just idiotic as an whole in my book."
2,too dirty to watch,"I went and saw this with my friend who had to see it for one of her college classes. I like both Jon Heder and Will Ferrell, but in this movie all the humor is very dirty and crude. It's not just a litte bit, it's a lot... and that kinda ruined the movie for me. I laughed at a couple parts, and it could have been a cuter story if not for all the dirty jokes. I know some people like that stuff- but it doesn't benefit me in any way.Hope this helps..."
1,"Just to let you know, This Title will not be released on Blu Ray Now","Uh, according to Paramount, they will be HD DVD exclusive starting with this release and Shrek 3 and Transformers.So Amazon has a lot of refunding to do.Don't waste your time buying this on Blu Ray, you will never get it.Get it on HD DVD."
5,Great film... now only available in HD DVD.,"The reviewers here look like crying girls wrapped in sour grapes...(laughs)This is a great film and will be available in all High Definition glory. What's wrong with that?People who are giving it one star JUST because paramount decided to go HD DVD exclusive do NOT seem to criticize Fox for being Blu-ray exclusive.Is there any difference?Grow up, little girls!This is a great film with great performances. I LOVE the scene where the we see the JFK and Marylin Monroe on ice (she spewing the pills is unforgettable!!!)LOL"
4,Ferrell = Comedy Legend,I read a bunch of 1 star reviews to see what people disliked about this movie ...and wow. Some people said it was stupid and then some people even had the nerve to say they don't even like Will Ferrell. Why are you watching this movie if you can't stand the lead actor??? And Will Ferrell's stuff is always stupid ...and that's why it's funny. I would say funnier than Talladega Nights but not as funny as Anchorman. Imagine if the movie was really stupid and absurd I'd much rather watch a really stupid movie than say watching Bewitched ...which is just God awful. (And in that movie Will Ferrell doesn't play the stupid-cocky guy)
5,Blades of Glory (DVD movie),This movie is definitely funny well if you like comedy movies. I really like it plus I do watch it a lot. Two men skating kind of awkward but they sure did put good actors for this movie to come out this great.:)
3,GREAT CAST AND SOME FUNNY MOMENTS SAVE THIS FROM DISASTER!,"I am a fan of most of the people in this film and I was not expecting this to be a masterpiece. It's got some very funny moments and it's barely an hour an a half long so, it's not hard to sit through this goofy comedy. This is not the best we have seen from any of these comics and I guess that is why I'm a little disappointed. It's worth renting or picking up cheap as the DVD transfer is very good and there are some interesting extras. The version I bought was a two disc version but, it doesn't state this on the case. If you like Will Ferrell you'll like this movie."
4,SO much better than expected!!!!,"I shunned previews of this film and refused to see it in theaters- it just looked silly/ridiculous, etc. So, when my husband brought it home to watch, I went into it with a bad attitude, expecting it to be mind-numbing. Although I love Will Farrell, I just didn't see how this film could be any good. Boy was I wrong! Within ten minutes we were hysterically laughing. I haven't laughed out-loud at a film so much in ages! The movie was outrageously funny and one of Farrell's best ever. Putting Jon Heder and Will Farrell together - let alone on ice- was brilliant.I highly recommend this movie- for adults and kids of all ages....its defintely a crowd-pleaser and will no doubt crack you up! :)"
5,Napoleon Dynamite meets Frank!!!,"Will Ferrell did it again with memorable hits singing like Fergie. Him and Jon Heder are totally hilarious when paired together as figure skaters. I never laughed so hard when the two were skating on the Aerosmith song ""I Dont Wanna Miss a Thing"" and the funniest quote from the movie.Chazz: ""She's as cold as the ice she skates on. She's like dry ice. No, wait! She's colder than that. What's colder than dry ice?Jimmy: I don't knowChazz: I'll tell you what is, Oksana."
3,Doesn't work with new routers,"I will soon be using this device as a hard wired device. It does not support SEVERAL new routers, including all type N routers that I have researched, and the D-Link - Xtreme N Wireless-N Gigabit Router does not work for sure. Plus, if it did work, the device only supports WEP, which is just about as good as taping your front door closed. The only plus that this device has is that it works with GB-PVR, but I can't use that until I have an ethernet cable running to my living room. Stick with the cheaper wired version, which is available at other retailers, such as NevvE@@."
3,"Great potential, short on results.","I bought this product because I believed it truly was the right approach as a media extender for what I use, which is ""Beyond TV"". I have a wireless network set up which has excellent signal strength and was recognized by the MediaMVP but, for some reason, was not able to acquire an IP address from my router. I investigated every option I had but was unsuccessful in getting it to work, Sadly, I eventually had to return the item. I hope Hauppauge will make the effort to improve this device because I think they are on the right track but needss work."
2,Beware: A duplicate,"This is the same book as ""Death and Judgment""; different covers and different publisher. Donna Leon and Brunetti are wonderful, but my husband and I each liked this the least of her books."
4,Recording is a breeze,"The unit came in perfect condition and sounds fantastic. Recording has become much easier and more inspired. I'm no longer limited to my AC30 and Marshall VM tones. The POD reproduces a great Fender Twin sound and the Vox AC30 model is so convincing that I don't bother to mic up the real thing anymore! The effects are a million times better than the original PODxt rack I have, especially the reverb. Re-amping is so easy and finding the tone in my head is faster and more efficient."
3,Bit slow....,I am also thrilled that the episodes have been released. I do not care so much that there are no special features. I just care that the episodes are there.I am disappointed though that there are just 12 episodes. There are at least 193 episodes in total for the 80's version of the show. Releasing just a few episodes at a time will take forever to get a complete collection. He-Man has recently been released and they are doing around 30 episodes per release. That means there will be just four releases to get the complete series.I just wish they did something similar with Turtles. Season 4 is ok because that has only 15 episodes anyway. The only other season that has more than 20 episodes is Season 7 which has 27 episodes. So if they could do a massive release next time with the rest of Season 3 that would be fantastic.
4,great show-poorly put together dvd,"ninja turtles was a great cartoon, needless to say the episodes rock. but the dvd is poorly put together. as with the 1st two seasons there are no special features. furthermore this time you dont even get a complete season, only 12 of like 40 eps that were in season 3. i was hoping this time there would be a boxset witht the whole season and special features. but alas i was disappointed yet again. at least this one came out like 6mnths after vol two as apposed to the year that i had to wait between volumes one and two. at least the show is still rocking as ever!!!"
2,POOR EFFORT. TRY HARDER ON THE NEXT ONE!!!,ABSOLUTELY NO SPECIAL FEATURES!ONLY HALF OF SEASON THREE!SPELLING ERRORS ON THE NAME BEBOP (BEBOB)!CHEAPLY MADE AND PUT TOGETHER!JUST TRYING TO CAPTILIZE ON THE CURRENT SUCCESS OF THE NEW SHOW!I WISH PETER LAIRD HAD THE RIGHTS TO THIS SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED CORRECTLY AND IN A COOL RESPECTFUL WAY!ONLY PLUSES ARE THE PRICE AND THE FACT ITS ON DVD!
1,A cure for insomnia.,"Spiker (Frank Zagarino, 2007)Zagarino (Fist Fighter 2)'s yawnfest involves an entirely un-scary serial killer (played by Zagarino himself) menacing a group of young-and-beautifuls in a scary old house. Okay, so we've never seen this one before. As usual, the only things that make it worth watching are three very brief pieces of entirely gratuitous nudity, one involving each of the three female Y-n-Bs. All of them are quite attractive, so if that's enough to get you watching, by all means, have fun. Unfortunately, though, you have to suffer through the rest of the movie, which is just as predictable and silly as you're expecting given what I've written so far. Worst movie I saw this week... I think. (half)"
3,Voice Over Success,"I found this book an interesting read, but not as informative as I was hoping it to be. This book basically takes voice over actors and lets them tell you their stories of how they got into, and made it in the VO business. If you are looking for a book that will help you in technique, the business, how to get started, how to set up a home studio, or any other VO related information for a beginner, then this book is not for you. If you are just looking for biographies of current and past VO talent and very little snippets of industry information, and not really concerned about getting into VO work, then this book may be for you and does offer some good stories. There are, however, books better suited for those that wish to get into the biz and book their first gig, but sadly, this book will not do it for you."
2,Only uses 40 watt bulbs,"The fan looks OK, BUT the installation directions were incomplete. Several steps were omitted which caused confusion. On the Amazon site for this fan, under ""Technical Details"", it states that this fan uses three 60 watt bulbs. But in the owners manual it states that you are not to exceed 40 watt bulbs. We're not happy with the lower amount of light it gives off. Wish we had known this before we purchased it."
5,Stylish & Quiet,"This fan not only looks good but is really easy to put up. Allow for three hours to get all of the parts assembled, but assembly is simple. I highly recommend that your celing box be metal, not plastic due to the weight. No problems with the fan so far!"
1,terrible,"I moved into a new house and have bought several ceiling fans for all the rooms. This is by far the worst of the lot. There are several issues with this:1. The install instructions are misleading. They do not mention some required steps. Further, following the instructions will result in a cosmetic part not being installed. It cannot be installed later since the downrod cannot be taken out once installed. I also bought the 42"" Southen Breeze (Hunter 20175) and am happy with that (similar to this but without the remote and has correct instructions).2. The fan and lights turn on without any action on my part. It is the only remtoe controlled unit in my house.3. The fan speed changes automatically after a few house at the desired speed.I tried to contact Hunter to see if they had any input but they were closed on Friday, 12/24 (day before Christmas) and on 12/27 (the Monday after Christmas). So,I returned it to Amazon inspite of the time and effort putting it up."
4,ceiling fan,Fan was simple to install and is very quiet. I am having trouble with the speed controls in the fan and sometimes it changes to fast mode by itself.
4,Pretty decent,"I've been installing a bunch of fans around the house and this one was better in some respects and worse in others. In particular, I did not like the way the stud mount attached to the fan rod. The fan looks great and works similarly well. It came with a remote control that I did not use, but it seemed fine."
3,Fan works great but installation was too painful,"Again, installation was way too painful that it was not worth the trouble. Rather buy something else."
3,It's only so-so,"This video is not nearly as entertaining as ""Trinity and Beyond"". The so-called ""rainbow bombs"" do not figure prominently and when they are seen, they are less than spectacular. Most of this video seems to focus more on the world situation at the time these tests were being conducted than on the actual tests themselves. A great deal of the extras on the disc are about JFK and the cuban missile crisis. As one reviewer mentioned, there seem to be just as many rockets blowing on the launch pad as there are explosions in space.Even tho I felt the title was a bit misleading, it is interesting."
1,Skip it.,"Even worse than the first film, ""Trinity"". The narration is a soft whisper, with sound effects and music covering it up. Even if it were easier to hear, there's nothing worthwhile. The production quality is very poor. People writing good reviews for this DVD are probably related to those selling this item."
5,BEAUTIFUL!,"Best word to describe these: beautiful! The cobalt is true and rich. They have thick glass, so the fear of breaking them is minimal. They are large, but work great for wines. So happy with this purchase!"
2,Not AWG.,"This is a metric tool.On one side, the numbers indicate (from largest to smallest), 35, 25, 16, 10, while on the other side, the numbers indicate 38, 22, 14, and 8.I assume then that this tool is designed for metric wire, not AWG.Metric 35 = 0.305 Dia while 2 AWG = 0.292Metric 25 = 0.255 Dia while 4 AWG = 0.232Metric 16 = 0.204 Dia while 6 AWG = 0.184Metric 10 = 0.162 Dia while 4 AWG = 0.146I could not find a reference for 38, 22, 14, and 8, so I have no idea what those numbers mean.The metric dies are probably close enough to AWG to work OK, but its not an AWG sized tool. Since the metric sizes are larger (generally between 1/32th or 1/64th) the crimps won't be quite as tight."
4,Not Quite as advertised,Tool is actually quite small and the ratchet mechanism is difficult to release once the crimp is made. It would be better if it was built so the ratchet lock was actually a ratchet. That said though it did do the job and the price is right.
5,Reliable,"I bought this unit new in 2007 and it has been my sole source of video/tv/computer screen. The HD quality rivals flat screen sets, in fact I really cant see the difference. I like the fact that it just projects on my wall and when its off, I dont have a tv set to try to decorate around. i dont use a screen and the quality is still outstanding.The negative is the bulb only last about 900 hours. I live alone so my bulb has lasted me up until now. They are quite expensive to replace. For me however the payoff is worth the picture quality on the HD channels, also the viewing area is almost my entire wall. I see the picture fine even with other lights on in the room or with the drapes open during the day.After 3 years I do not regret this purchase. I bought it for $2k from Costco. The price has increased since then so I suspect its reputation endures."
3,Flashes of brilliance,"Calvin Trillin has two qualities that distinguish him as a writer. One is a great talent for deadpan wit, and the other is a true amateur's enthusiasm for everything he tries.The latter serves him best when he's writing about food, or about travel, or about everyday life in New York, but less so when he writes about politics and world events. His perspective on his own countrymen is often narrow, provincial, and downright condescending. He can't bring himself to admit that someone could hold different views from his and still be a moral person.But no matter. There's still a nice variety of wit and droll observation contained in this volume to make up for the pieces that fall flat."
5,A must have for all Pokemon fans,This book was bought for my 7 year old Pokemon fan and he absolutely loves it! Easy to follow instructions are provided in assisting him draw his favorite characters. I recommend this to all kids that want to accurately draw the Pokemon characters.
2,How to draw a very few Pokemon,"Simple, small, lacking in content. I'd love to see this book with perhaps 5 times the content and perhaps some, ""how do draw backgrounds"" for your Pokemon scene. How to draw a Tree, House, and so on, would be welcome content to this book that simply capitalizes on the Pokemon craze.Pretty simple and disapointing."
2,How to Draw Pokemon by Tracey West,The instructions on how to draw Pokemon are OK - info is very limited. The book is very thin and not worth the money. Was disappointed in it.
5,Wonderful,"I bought this for my son as a reward for doing well in school. He is 9 years old and in the fourth grade. It turns out my 5 year old and 4 year olds both enjoy it immensely, much to the dismay of my son (no girls allowed, lol.)My son decided to trace the images for a quilt we are making to donate to kids in a loval hospital."
3,ok,It can teach you how to draw pokemon but each step adds alot more of the pokemon.If you are exstemly into drawing pokemon you should try to find a more beginner type drawing book.
5,"I bought this for my 9 year old son who loves Pokemon,","anything Pokemon. He loves to draw and had been asking for a how to book, I ordered this one and it is great for him. It is easy to do, step by step instructions. He can sit for hours and draw and trace from this book."
2,book was very used,This book was very used. I knew that I was getting a used book but didn't know it would be colored in and have marker all over the pages. The cover was very bent and had a few small rips.
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for one of my kids. I thought it would be a pretty extensive book, with templates to draw a big variety of Pokemon characters. However, it is a relatively small book, with a limited number of guides for drawing various Pokemon. Considering the cheap price, I should have assumed this, but I did not. This said, you get what you paid for. A small price for a limited number of Pokemon characters."
1,poor,this tells you how to draw about 15 pokemon.i tried doing the steps but it did not turn out wright.they tell you dumb stuff like wants they give you the steps for igglybuff they say you can draw jigglypuff.they do that for almost every pokemon.i did a better pichu by tracing then these steps.OK WHEN I GOT THIS BOOK I WAS DISAPOINTED.IT IS JUST MY OPINION.SO WHAT IF I WAS HARSH IT IS TRUE.I WAS MAD WHEN I GOT THIS BOOK
3,Drawing Pokemon,"My daughter liked looking through this book, but it was confusing to her how they showed you to do the drawing."
5,Son's drawing perfect Pokemon!,"My son loves this book. He's really into drawing and loves the how-to-draw books, and this was no exception. Within minutes he was whipping up poke'mon from the pages of the book onto paper and making his own comic book of them. Great for any pokemon fan who loves to draw!"
4,Ignore all other reviews!,"I beleive that the other reviews were written by furious begginer artists whom had tried a few times and were uspset with their results. It takes time to learn how to draw and drawing simple shapes such s circles is not as easy as it is made out to be! I don't think this book could be made any simpler and is perfect for the begginer.Note: I noticed that other reviews stated: I got better results when I traced the pictures. Well of course you did! No matter how simple the book was, the artists would have been drawing for years and five hours of drawing is nothing compared to that."
3,Not bad,I agree that the other reviews were a little harsh. My 7 year old prefers to trace the characters rather than draw them. This book is a favorite.
3,Maybe kindergarten age,"The name ""Pokemon"" sold itself. The book itself was rather thin, but could stimulate the imagination. O.K. as an addition to another item."
5,Great for Beginners and Pokemon Lovers,"I bought this book for my 10 year old daughter who is a total Pokemon lover. She is a bit behind in her small motor skills, but she loves this book and has no trouble mimicking the drawing techniques. I also bought two other Pokemon drawing books and they are also really good books. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan and loves to draw."
2,Not worth what you pay.,The drawing instructions are very poor and short. The book is incredibly short. I would value this book at $2 MAX!
3,Valuable - in its own Context,"Dorfman and Mattelart's book is based on Donald Duck comics circulated throughout Latin America. Those books were translated and largely re-written by overzealous editors and are more different from than similar to Carl Barks' original comics. Insofar as one is interested in US / Latin American policy, politics and business, it is useful.Disney's domestic business practives are by no means benign, but Barks is one of the more significant comics artists and enjoyed a much greater degree of creative freedom than most creators of the time. Barks cartooning is fluid and subtle, as is his storytelling.For an insight into ""the Duck Man's"" work, check out Donald Ault's much more up-to-date book ""Carl Barks: Conversations."""
1,Can't argue with success: Why Disney beat Marx,"It was quite appropriate for Disney to have used vultures representing Hegel and Marx, and dogs dressed up like Che and Castro. Marxism has manifestly failed, at enormous cost in needless suffering, political death, and the impoverishment of millions (please read ""The Black Book of Communism""). Castro is much more popular among chic Westerners who don't have to live in his prison state than he is to his enslaved population. Really, the whole matter can be summed up by quoting some graffitti that was scrawled on one of Castro's innumerable propaganda posters. The official text of the poster read ""Socialism or death!"" The clever graffitti commentator wrote below it ""What's the difference?"""
1,never again,i ordered this product and when i got it iwas the wrong one i wasted 400 dollars and had to cancel my trip because of them i would never order on here again. i called them to see if they will overnight me a new one and the told me i would have it on monday and it was a thursday. they offered a 20 dollar credit but failed to tell me it was only good on amazon prime products so everything i wanted did not qualify. hope you luck is better
1,Very Poor quality....,Item is very poor quality....item arrived with blue discoloration all over white part of the pad....most likely from blue color wipe container that comes with this pad and is included.
2,Not very durable,"I like the size and shape of this pad, but after a few months of use, all the folds are cracking and ripping. I would say that I use it a minimal amount- maybe a few times a week. Kids need a changing pad for a lot longer than a few months, so it's disappointing to have to replace it so quickly."
2,"Cheap Camera, Cheap Photos","I just received my camera last week, and haven't yet discovered and experimented with all of its functions, but I've already run into a few problems.The biggest problem I'm having so far is taking pictures at night. Depending on the flash setting, the pictures either come out really over-exposed, or blurry- and it takes forever for it to even take the pictures! My last camera (Canon Powershot) took very crisp and well-lit night shots, and didn't have a very long lag between pushing the button and taking the picture.I was very excited when I found this camera online for so cheap and with such perfect reviews. My main point is BEWARE. The camera is cheap- and you get what you pay for."
4,Beautiful Marie Antoinette Barbie Doll,"This is one of the most beautiful barbie doll I have ever seen in my life, I thought the moment I saw it on Amazon that I was my luckiest DAY of my barbie collection because I was looking for this doll, and I even try to buy it, BUT HONESTLY DID YOU SEE THE PRICE! . I MEAN COME ON, THIS IS TOOOOOO OVER PRICE. I might be willing to spend $600- $800 but $1,999 ARE YOU SERIOUS?"
5,The Doll is Just Glorious in every way but...,"The Doll, like Marie Antoinette is Larger Than Life, The Delicate Details on the Dress , is absolutely stunning, this is by far the most prettiest doll that barbie had ever made, you can just stare at it all day, [...]."
3,Straw isn't long enough,Does anyone know where or how i can acquire a longer straw? I'm using this silicone can to lubricate under the belt of my treadmill and i can't reach all the way.
2,Not what is says,"The description for this product states""quick-drying no-mess formula"" but the fact is that it is not what I call quick-drying and it is definitely messy. But it is a lubricant."
1,HAS ABSOUTLELY NOTHING TO DO WITH SYLVIA BROWNE,THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SYLVIA BROWNE AND SHOULDN'T BE LISTED UNDER HER BOOKS OR HAVE HER IN THE DESCRIPTION. THIS BOOK WAS ORDERED FOR ME UNDER FALSE ADVERTISEMENT USING HER TO SELL THIS BOOK. HER NAME WAS NO WHERE EVEN MENTIONED IN THIS. THIS BOOK IS SIMPLY A MUSIC BOOK FOR THE HARP. I WAS VERY UPSET WHEN THIS BOOK ARRIVED AND I FOUND IT WAS A MUSIC BOOK!! PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU THINK IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH SYLVIA BROWNE.
3,Beading for children,I guess this book would be okay for children. The animals really did not like description.
3,Geckos and Other Bead Animals,The product didn't come in the expected condition as was described. There was writing in the book when she stated that the pages were free of writing. The cover was in rough shape.
3,Middle of the Road,"Titling this collection ""The Road Series"" would lead one to believe that it is a complete collection of the Hope and Crosby ""Road"" movies. Actually there are three road movies missing from this set. It doesn't make sense not to include them. What's included is great, but what's missing is very disappointing."
3,Better as rental,I never watched these movies before and wanted to see some Bob Hope so I bought them. They are good but I would rather of rented them instead of buying the whole set. I would recommend if you have never seen them before rent first and if you love them THEN buy them. It is a good set for those looking to buy them though! With some bonus stuff that's nice to watch too.
4,These Roads Lead To Fun!,"The ""Road to..."" movies by Hope and Crosby (and of course Dorothy Lamour) were and are absolutely hilarious. This collection provides four of the movies at a very reasonable price. I only wish it included ALL of the Road movies."
1,Very misleading and disappointing ...,"The subtitle is ""A Groundbreaking Study into the Nature of Life and Death"". The only study in the book is hardly groundbreaking because it yielded no useful results due to insufficient data. The author even admitted that. Then the author talks about another study involving out-of-body experiences, but can't do it because he has no funding, and that's where the research ends. The book is padded with anecdotal accounts of NDEs that the author received in the mail. That's hardly very scientific. There are terse rehashes of other scientists' work, but again it reads like a way to pad the book because the author has nothing new to add. In two different places, the concept of correlation was mentioned, and it was butchered both times. Don't waste your money if you're interested in science."
1,Guess what? Dr. Parnia doesn't know....,"This has to be one of the most diappointing books I have read on this subject. Basically, it is a bunch of theories by other researchers that are tossed around in a disorganized fashion (peppered by some anecdotal accounts from people who have experienced NDE's, which was somewhat interesting.) There wasn't even a study completed due to lack of funding, so nothing was ever examined. Very misleading and really a waste of time."
1,WARNING THIS BOOK CONTAINS NO RESEARCH,"I finished this book tonight with an overwhelming sense that I had just wasted several days reading something that at first seemed so promising... I kept thinking, well there is still 40 pages left I'm sure he will get around to discussing his ""groundbreaking"" study .....30 pages .... 20 pages ..... By the last 10 pages I was disgusted. I had been fooled. If you like anecdotal evidence and cute little stories, or if you have ever read a Sylvia Brown book, perhaps you will enjoy this book however, if you are looking for substance and objective research Dr. Sam Parnia would much rather write about his inability to secure the necessary funding to provide you with any. I assure you all of the other critical points made by other reviewers here are absolutely true. The publisher, author and proponents of this book are an embarassment to serious science and the reason why research like this doesn't get funding."
3,Too much technical knowledge,"This book is a wealth of information. However, it is very dry reading. I am about half way through it, and it is pretty boring."
5,Excellent Book!,This was an excellent book! The book provides information about near death experiences and studies surrounding their existence. This book also provides details about the varying studies that have already been conducted or are currently being conducted to objectify near death experiences. This book caused me to further consider life after death and to engage in a bit of philosophical thought on the subject matter.
1,Dull,"I have to admit I was disappointed and surprised I manage to finish the book. I picked this one because the author is a doctor who is doing research of NDEs (near death experiences). If it wasn't fairly short I don't think I would have. It doesn't have enough antidotes and the science parts were difficult to read. The author just doesn't have the ability to write in layman's terms well enough to make it understandable and enjoyable. Because of that, the narrative was slow and plodding.I'm not going to bother getting another book about possibilities of the afterlife. I'll just have to wait until I die like everybody else."
2,Hope I wont have to read it again in my afterlife,"The beginning is fine since he was telling the NDE experiences of patients who had cardiac arrest. After he ran of out experiences to talk about, he basically focused on his attempt of his first research, which he didn't explain any further, then jumped into his struggles to raise funds for more advanced studies, repeating again and again the same thing about how people's NDE experience transformed them."
3,"Interesting, but not a lot of new data","The book speaks of a new ground-breaking study, but introduces no new data. A good background book on the subject."
3,Deals with Near Death experiences exclusively,One can skip pages and still catch up with what is going on. Nearly 90% of the book on NDE and nothinh much. Disappointing.
2,Disappointing,"I've read the book and was not impressed. Although there was great promise in the pretense of this book, the author never actually got around to conducting the 'large study' he talks about concerning NDEs and what happens when a person dies. He has some anecdotal stories to tell, but he never reports on any factual findings. All in all it was disappointing, and the authors writing style was amateurish and not very captivating. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Mt. House Best Sellers Kit,"Sadly this seller must be using fear of disaster and Amazon's (typical) price competitiveness to gouge customers. This product that they are selling for $43 is available from a large national retailer for only $35. And not that I even realized this other retailer sold Mt. House products, I didn't, but a simple Google search showed me a bunch of places significantly cheaper than here."
4,"just some ink stains, but nothing critical.","Besides some ink stains on the side of the book, that do not effect me reading the book. fast delivery."
2,Only one bottle in shipment!!,I thought I was getting 2 bottles of shampoo-not! This product is way overpriced for only one bottle! I returned and was charged for return shipping! Someone needs to change the picture of product! BTW-I love this shampoo!!
2,"Seems cheap, Index is confusing/incomplete","This book is printed on regular printer paper (not the normal glossy textbook paper). For over $100 I would expect higher quality. It makes highlighting and writing notes difficult because the color bleeds through to the other side. The index is extremely frustrating and difficult to use. When looking up topics to study for midterms I just had to scan entire chapters because page numbers were wrong entirely in the index or the topic was left out completely. If you are going to rip off students with high textbook prices, at least make sure you have a quality product."
1,Lots of great info,"This book was extremely difficult to understand. It says 'Introductory' in the title, but it is not introductory enough. It has a lot of really good information in it about the subject, but it goes right into technical stuff without explaining much, and no glossary to define new terms"
5,Obra prima,"Este cd è uma verdadeira obra prima, tudo o cd è um prazer, ha canoes e musica sem palavras que deixa todos com uma grande surpresa, este compositor convida en este cd Sakamoto, Rosas Passos e muito mais......"
3,Predicable thriller/horror but not bad for a Sunday afternoon,"There are many stories surrounding the Heilige Lance or the Spear that pierced the side of Christ at the time of the crucifixion.In ""The Spear"" right from the outset, I mean the title does kind of give it away, as does a small quote from Wagner's Parsifal (Which also deals with this subject), you guess that at some stage there will be a battle between Good the private detective Harry Steadman and Evil who is represented by some rather sadistic Nazis with the Spear/Lance having a part to pay.As with other books that I have reviewed, great premise for a good thrilling read, the only problem that I had was it took too long to get the reader into the race of the story, and then the ending to me seemed rushed with more of a horror component thrown in to keep the reader entertained.Don't get me wrong it wasn't that the work was bad its just that in my humblest of opinions it could have been that little bit better"
1,Dickens' Mysteries Hunted Down,Only mystery here is why the above title is Mysteries when there is only one short story included. Very poor come on for this title!
3,Kindle Version - Only one story!!!,"Despite the description, this is ONLY ONE STORY.It was, admittedly, a good story... but the description said it was all of Dickens' mysteries together. Now one could argue that that is true if all he wrote was one... but even if that was true it still seems misleading..."
3,Short book,It was a good book and that good stories of detective stories about stories about Charles sickens of the Christmas Carol ok
4,Beach House is like bad pizza...it's still pretty good!,"Give this CD a few spins and some time to grow on you. You will find some classics here like Pacing The Cage, Semi-True Story and I Don't Know and I Don't Care. While ""Beach House On The Moon"" is not the strongest Buffett CD ever, it still has its fair share of fun and listenable tunes. And that is what Jimmy Buffett is all about. Buffett seems to always to imply not to take things so seriously... just lay back and enjoy the music for what it's worth."
4,The Buffett I Came to Love,"It's been interesting to read these reviews. Having been a Buffett fan since 1976, I await releases with anticipation. The first time through this one, I wasn't sure. However, it hasn't come out of my CD player yet and I like most every song on it. I am one who has been disappointed with some of the more recent Buffett efforts, like Banana Wind and Barometer Soup. They were good but got a little too Carribean for me. For short timers, that wasn't always his sound. This reminds me of Floridays, one of my all-time favorites. Give this one a few listens and pay attention. One reviewer said he hadn't heard one song all the way through. You've got to give it a chance.Great effort, Bubba. See you in Atlanta in July."
4,A Wonderful return to the past,"As others have said, I was somewhat disappointed on the first listen through, because you have to do just that... Listen. Excellent look at life today, as always, some things hit a little too close to real life."
4,now you know what a 50 year old pirate thinks about,"the story telling techniques of jimmy b. continue. what will i think about when i get older? not how my investments are doing, not moving to the warmer climate for winter... but why is my wife jogging so much, or where can i go to get some great gumbo. WHO cares about all of the troubled times... buy the cd and listen to the words and the hard stuff in life will go away. instead of chicken soup for the soul, this cd is gumbo for the soul. i especially liked ""pacing the cage"", ""gumbo"" and ""i don't know and i don't care"". every parrot head will relate to this cd. after listening to this you wanna-be's can and will get hooked..."
4,THIS ONE GROWS ON YOU...,"BEING THE FIRST ON MAY 18 TO PURCHASE ""BEACH HOUSE ON THE MOON"" AT THE LOCAL WAL-MART, AFTER SITTING IN THE REAR PARKING LOT SPAPPING IT INTO THE PLAYER LIKE SOME JUNKIE DROOLING BEFORE HIS LATEST FIX, I WAS CONFUSED.. THIS WAS DIFFERENT.. NOT TOO MUCH STEEL DRUM (THANK GOD) AND THE STEEL GUTIAR WAS BACK!! AFTER LOADING IT UP 4 TO 5 TIMES, I WAS LAUGHING AND MELLOWING TO MR. BUFFETT'S LATEST.. HE HAS DONE IT AGAIN, IN THIS OLD PARROTHEADS' OPIONION.. GOOD BLEND OF SERIOUS AND OFF THE WALL STUFF.. ""PACING THE CAGE"" BOUGHT A TEAR TO MY EYE AND ""i DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T CARE"" HAD ME POUNDING ON THE STEARING WHEEL.. ANOTHER DOSE OF ST. JOHS WART IN DISC FORM, AS FAR AS THIS OLD PARROTHEAD IN CONCERNED.. 4 BIG STARS.. WE LOVE YA, JIMMY!!"
1,What was this?,What in the world? It was some of the worst Buffett I had ever heard. Nothing amazing and not even one song that I could enjoy over and over. I can't believe I bought it.
2,"No Gravity, nor Energy, on the Moon","Hey it's still fun and all Parrotheads will phlock to purchase this new release but it's lacking energy. Buffett really ""sells"" escape and this time I think we are all left feeling a bit like the one,very good,cover""Pacing the Cage."" Mid-life crisis symptoms? Too many toys to play with make Jimmy a dull boy."
1,The Worst Buffett Album Ever!,"There is no spirit or effort in Buffett's latest release. It seems as though he was very depressed when writing the songs; few of the songs are upbeat. However, he does have an interesting belnd of country/calypso. In the end, I am still nastalgic for hid old Caribbean rhymes."
4,Wow!,"I totally loved this cd. I am a high school student who hates math,so the song Math Suks has become my themesong"
1,This new Cd is the Pits:(:(:(,"Jimmy:If you release another Cd like this it may be time to hang it up and retire. This is the worse bunch of garbage that I ever listened to. Wow, what happened on this one? Are you now just producing Cd's for profit? Have you forgotten the loyal fans who have stood by you all these years? I think that you should donate all your profits from this CD to Greenpeace or something or return all of our money!Yuk--Listened to the CD three times then gave it to my Parrot to chew on.I COULD NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. SAY THIS CANNOT BE YOUR TUNES JIMMY! SAY IT IS NOT SO!:(:(:("
2,cliche'd jimmy,"I own a lot of Buffet's Cd's and this was a real disappointment, it was like he said it was time for a new album so he thought of all the current cliches and used them to make songs of them. I was very unhappy, the only one that was original Jimmy was ""Beach House on the Moon""."
1,"This CD is a joke, right?","I was very excited about this new CD after the lift I got from Bananna Wind. After listening to this CD one time in my car, on the way home from the record store, I literally tossed it out the window into the bushes along route 78. It was not even good enough to give away to someone else who might have different taste. It was just plain terrible. I will not buy another JB CD without previewing it first. It seems like Jimmy sold out and just cranked this one out to meet a contract commitment or something. Sorry Jimmy, I still love ya, but this CD sucks worse than math."
3,Another step down in quality,"Just as Jimmy's albums took a general downturn from the 70's to 80's, and from the 80's to the 90's, this album again shows another step down in quality; further distancing himself farther from the classic music he once wrote in the 70's.I mean, I'm a big Parrothead, and I REALLY want to like this album, but he makes it so very difficult with the weak material included. In fact, with repeated listens, it's actually getting harder to enjoy it.Jimmy just seems to be coasting most of the time on this disc (coasting in a bad way), going through the motions, on autopilot. He really needed/needs a reality check of his music, away from his current trend, and back to something of substance. I doubt that this album will hold up to the test of time as his 70's-80's albums have.Sorry"
3,Give me the old stuff anyday.....,"Even a bland studio offering from JB is better than nothing to stir up the summertime. But before you fire up the blender this summer with this latest offering to the neo-parrotheads (yes you know who you are), step back in time for what Jimmy does best-playing Live. I would suggest his live album Feeding Frenzy. Bad publicity and no-name cover art let this one slip through the cracks, but what matters is what's inside. Pure Jimmy Buffett. Live. The way he used to be, before that carnival thing corrupted it all."
4,"Buffett impresses with ""Beach House On The Moon""","Poet, storyteller, musician, author. Those are just four words to describe the multitude of talents that Jimmy Buffet possesses. He exhibits all those skills and more with his new CD ""Beach House On The Moon"". The disc has the usual Jimmy Buffet feel to it, meaning that you want to get the blender and mix a Pina Colada and relax by the water. If he didn't put music to his lyrics he could probably use some of his stuff as a stand-up comic. ""You Call It Jogging"" is one of those instances. The song is about a girl who tells her husband that she is going jogging while he knows that she is really ""running around"". All in all, if you want a trip to the Islands but don't have the time or can't afford the air fare, put ""Beach House On The Moon"" into your CD player, close your eyes, and you may even wake up with a tan."
1,Once a Parrothead...,"Always a Parrothead. I've enjoyed JB's music for decades--and I used to really look forward to ner releases.When I bought this one, several years ago, it was the last time I bought a JB album when it first comes out.I miss the old Jimmy, one whose music is infused with life that he shares with the listener. Perhaps he's too pulled between touring, writing books and writing music...Not his best effort..."
3,honestly..mathsux...3 * max...,"Math sux made me almost waver...to remind myself why I like him, I immediately resort to his old catalog...math sux, seriously...probably worst song he's ever let be known"
3,NOT ONE OF HIS BEST BUT STILL A GOOD LISTEN,"IT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE TO CATCH ON TO JIMMY'S NEW CD BUT LIKE MANY OF HIS SONGS, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE WORDS. HE ALWAYS TELLS A GREAT STORY AND THEY PULL YOU IN. MY FAVORITES ARE ""I DON'T CARE"" AND ""JOGGING. WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE HARMONICA AND STEEL DRUMS!!!"
2,with just the samples heard I hope the rest of cd is better,I'm buying it thru Amazon that way I know I got my money's worth if I'm disapointed. I'm a loyal fan of JB's. Here's to hoping he makes enough off the sales of this cd to atleast buy that beach house on the moon or atleast another plane.
3,"A very relaxed Jimmy, perhaps a little to mellow.","Okay, I am one of those strange creatures called a ""Parrot Head"" and had difficulty sleeping last night in anticipation of this release. With great tropical visions, and fun tickets in my pocket I ran to the local music store, purchased the first one out of the box, grabed a soda and ran to the car, plugged it in, then checked to make sure it was Jimmy, for at first it was difficult to tell! The music fell short of my anticipated tropical dreams and summer visions that Jimmy has so well created in the past. After all its summer, time to dream, and exhaust all my fun tickets and worship the summer tour! Its a fine addition to the collection, but I wished he would have ""kicked it up a notch."""
3,"Jimmy was born to sing ""Pacing the Cage""","The best of this CD was writen by members of the Coral Reefer Band or others. ""Lucky Star"" by (Peter Mayer & Roger Guth) is my favorite, a true parrot head point of view. ""I will play for Gumbo"" is a good Jimmy Buffet work of art, but the high lite of this CD is ""Pacing the Cage"" Jimmy Buffett was born to sing this song. It fits him like your farvorite pair of flip flops. I hope this makes a hit for Jimmy. Buy this CD you will like it!"
4,This one will grow on you!,"My first impression of this CD was not entirely positive. But on the 3rd and 4th play I found myself really enjoying most of the songs. ""I Will Play for Gumbo"" is destined to be one of my all-time favorites.My only concern is that my rating may be premature. After a few more listenings, it may be a 5 star CD."
4,"catchy and witty tunes which seem familiar, yet fresh.","This is Buffett's best album since ""One Particular Harbor"". It is eclectic, witty, and best of all--fun to listen to. The best songs on the album retain a certain familiarity, yet also seem fresh. Listen to ""I will play for Gumbo"", ""Lucky Stars"" and ""Flesh and Bone""--you'll see what I mean."
2,I've heard much better from the boys,"Hi:First I am a big Buffett fan and have most of his CD's. I am disappointed with this new recording. It's too slow of a tempo in most songs with maybe a few good ones here and there. In fact, I think most of JB's work the last few years fits this pattern. Or, honestly, maybe it's just me. I prefer the uptempo songs that seem to reflect his earlier days. Songs like ""The Weather is here, wish you were beautiful"" , ""Fins"", or slow songs with meaning like ""12 Volt Man"" or ""Pirate looks at 40"". JB's latest efforts seem like they were recycled from bits and pieces of these old recordings (if you listen to ""I will play for Gumbo"" see if you hear the melody from ""jolly Man"" in there. I do. Granted there are a few worthy songs on this CD but nothing that will characterize it as a great cd. But in some odd way I'm happy I bought it. I guess that's why I am a parrothead. Even substandard songs can please us. Thanks,Francis"
3,Good stuff - worth listening to!,"The more I listen to the CD, the more I like it. It is not my favorite overall CD of his but I think it shows that MY FAVORITE ARTIST is growing older, but not up (Math Suks). To all the ""educators"" who are panning the Math Suks song, I say ""get a life - it's a song for pete's sake"". I'm looking forward to this summer's concert and hearing Jimmy play his new stuff along with the older stuff."
4,It's a Permanent Reminder of a Temporary Feeling!!,"OK, I'm one of those ""I love everything Jimmy does"" phans, but regardless, I love this CD! I had my favorite from my first listen-through (""I Will Play for Gumbo,"" especially the ""it's a little like religion and a lot like sex, you should never know when you're gonna get it next"" line!), but the rest of album quickly endeared itself to me as well. I cannot get the ""Permanent Reminder of a Temporary Feeling"" chorus out of my head, and ""I Don't Know and I Don't Care"" is very entertaining. Even my anti-Buffett high school sophomore laughed out loud when he heard ""Math Suks!"" I don't know of any other artist who can combine words like Jimmy can to tell a story and, most importantly, tell it well, with the right touches of nostalgia and humor added in. No matter what's going on in my life, I cannot help but smile when I put on this CD. Thank you, Jimmy, for our own permanent reminder of a temporary feeling!"
4,His best since Changes in Lattitudes.,"A vast improvement over past two CDs. This effort ranks as one of Buffett's best since, my personal favorite, ""Changes in Lattitudes"". For those partial to Jimmy's ballads this CD will be a real pleasure."
3,Not one of his best,"I do like most of the songs, but songs like Math Sucks has got to go. Some like Call It Jogging do grow on you. But all in all, not my boy Jimmys best work."
2,Yet another boring '90's Buffett Album,"As a long time Buffett fan, I once again was suckered into buying an album of his in the '90's hoping (foolishly) it would be a return to form (A1A or Changes in Latitude are IMO his best). Instead, this is merely more of the vapid mutterings of Barometer Soup, Banana Wind, and (yikes) Fruitcakes. While Buffett is a great storyteller, there is none of that here. ""Math Suks"" is typically puerile and the title track is almost too difficult to listen to for 6 minutes. ""Pacing the Cage"" is a great song, but was done far far better by its originator (Bruce Cockburn). Unless you have enjoyed Jimmy's '90s output, stay away from this one."
1,Worst piece of mess since 'Before the Beach',"I was very disappointed in this album. I don't know what Bubba was thinking when he released thisThis is as bad - or worse than Before the Beach, not a singable or memorable tune on the whole thing."
2,What ?!?,"To the Floridian who said he's the perfect critic for this album is out of his mind. After listening to this album, what Caribbean stoires is he telling here? Half the album is covers and the other half have nothing to do with that part of the equator. Sometimes, Jimmy's songs, lyrics and music just don't hit the mark, as he has said so i n the past as well. Man, what album were you listening to?"
2,An excuse to tour,"This and his last 2 albums are nothing more than something to put out to tour. He's getting like the Rolling Stones where they put out an album to promote a tour, not vice-versa."
2,Jimmy makin money on us,Its a sad thing to get old but Jimmy this is one sad album.....lets take our time next time.
3,"Not as good as Bannana Wind but, better than Carnival!","It takes a few spins until you begin to enjoy this album, it includes some good songs that will be included in a best of someday!"
4,A little mellow....but still good stuff!,"Although many of the songs on this CD are much slower than expected, Jimmy produces another solid, enjoyable collection of stories. I listened to it about two or three times before I finally appreciated Jimmy's imagination and wit. The CD is also a great deal of fun with tunes like ""Flesh and Bone"" and ""You call it Jogging"". A MUST for all Parrotheads!!!!"
4,best new album since barometer soup. good song writing.,"this is the best buffett album since barometer soup. although a little too long on steel drums, the album is filled with catchy songs. some are funny, some are about love. however, buffett seems to have lost the ability to convey songs that move the heart. the quality of the album is good, but fails to reach the level of the white sport coat, a1a, or havanna daydreamin albums. buffet is too fat, too rich and too comfortable. further he has spread himself over too many projects and the quality of all is diluted."
3,Average at Best,"Jimmy Buffett's latest CD has a few good moments (Flesh and Bone, I Will Play for Gumbo, Math Suks), but most of the songs are just uninteresting filler. I'm a big Buffett fan and have all his CD's, but I think I have to agree with the reviewer who says that he has too much going on in his life. His previous CD, Don't Stop the Carnival, was not very good and his last book ""A Pirate Looks at Fifty"" was awful. Jimmy should decide what is more important to him and focus on that. I hope he decides it is music."
2,Contractual obligation,"This must be a disc done as part of an agreement with his record company. I have been a Buffett fan since day one. This disc displays no emotion or typical Buffett atmosphere.There is no enthusiasm in any of the songs. It appears the great music has no powerful vocals. Any individual with no emotion or enthusiam could read the lyrics as well as Mr. Buffett does in this disc. I am sorry to say this does not deserve being in any catagory with past Buffett music. This one belongs in a recycle bin with all the other boring AM groups with no musical quality, just those in it for the buck."
2,Where has Bubba gone?,"Sorry, This one, to me, may be his worst effort ever. Everyone can say that jimmy is now introspective and contemplative if they want. The truth of the matter is Jimmy has legions of fans because all of his old tunes were simple, rythmic songs you could hum along with. His music used to be repeating structures that the meaningful (or silly) lyrics rhymed their way through. With this album you need to have a masters degree from Juliard to appreciate the constant melody changes in songs like BHOM. The closest Buffett comes to his old greatness on this album is his version of ""You call it Jogging"" Buffett is not Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, or Paul Simon. If he were you wouldn't see PARROTHEADS at his shows. I've haven't missed an Atlanta show in 21 years. Don't plan on missing any future one's either. Hey even Ali had a bad fight or two."
5,Jimmy could make Twinkle Twinkle Little Star sound good!,"I haven't heard a Buffett CD I didn't like! Jimmy's music really does ""Change Your Whole Latitude"" This CD reminds me of why I became a Parrot Head in the first place. His music takes you places that you can't always get to on your own. I'm lucky enough to have visited the Florida Panhandle on several occasions. This music is that place! The slow, easy pace that these people keep is as much an inspiration as Jimmy's music. If more people ""Listened"" to his music there'd be a lot less violence in this world! You have to appreciate that!!! THANKS JIMMY!"
1,excitment turns to disappointment,"all the hype, that this was the comeback for JB I could not wait. As ususal, got first one locally. Prepared to spend the day memorizing all the words... I realize that some songs you have to listen to several times, for them to grow on you.. just did not happen.. I was so sad. I had waitied for this for so long. I feel he just does not have his heart in this any longer. He is not good at coasting... sure wish we had the old Jimmy back... Perhaps he should have spent more time working on songs, than writing in his diary."
2,Simply disappointing.,"I hate to say it. It hurts me deep down inside to do so. But this CD is weak. Just plain weak. There is no song that just jumps out and shakes you up. There is no song to make you excited that summer is just around the corner. Maybe I haven't listened to it enough, but I just don't see this CD growing on me anytime soon. I can honestly say that there is not a single song on here that I like better than any of his previous efforts. Anyway, if you're looking for a CD to really put you in the mood for fun in the sun, pick up an earlier release. This is certainly not a return to an earlier Buffett sound."
1,Beached Whale On the Moon,"Ouch! This is one painful CD! Cut after cut of lackluster, boring forgetable music. With the exception of ""Pacing the Cage"" this one is all lifeless blather. If you're going to sing ""fun songs"" you ought to at least try to sound like you're having fun doing it. I don't mind artists trying out new things, but this is ridiculous. How come Amazon won't let me give this CD zero stars?"
2,Am I still a Parrot-head after this one!?!?,"I cannot say I love it. It took 5 listens to almost like it. I don't know what it is about this album, but it just didn't get me going like the past albums have. I mentioned this to a fellow Buffett fan and he acted like it was sacreligious to think this way! Sorry, but the writing is not there. The only 2 songs I really like ""Pacing the Cage"" and ""Running around"" were not even written by Jimmy. Hell even at the concert this year, Southern Cross (also another cover) was the best. Jimmy......Time to get back to your roots! I bought this CD ""tracks unheard"" as I normally do and am dissapointed to say the least. Head back to 'Bama.... some island....or even New Orleans... but try to remember where it is that you pulled all that great music out of! Sorry, but I cannot recommend this one and I cannot believe that I am saying this!....But yeah..I guess I'm still a Parrot Head....just of the older first 20 or so album stuff!..."
2,Fair...,"A few good songs do not make up for what seems to be a warmed over example of his earlier works. If he intends this to be reminiscent, he succeeds only in that it has much of the same easy listening qualities of music my Dad used to play in the 70's. Not a bad album mind you, just lackluster when compared to his other attempts."
3,Fan before there were even parrotheads,"Jimmy Buffett's music continues to evolve in a wonderful way. Though Beach Houses on the Moon is not one of his best, there is some great music on this CD. A bit more rock and roll sounding than some, Jimmy shows great versatility on this CD. Skip track #2 - Permanent Reminder of a Temporary Feeling - musically this is not up to snuff for Jimmy. What this CD said to me is that as Jimmy grows older, he is somewhat growing up but still knows how to enjoy the good things in life - his children, good food, laughter-- both at himself and the world in general. I have been, and will continue to be, his biggest fan!"
3,Add it to the mix of Buffett Lifestyle,"Jimmy puts out tunes that make you smile and enjoy listening to...even better with a drink and the beach, enjoy as desired."
2,Ugh-What happened to Jimmy!,"I bought this latest release sound unheard. I won't do that again. IMHO, I think his music has been going downhill and getting more contract obligated (like his book, Pirate looks at Fifty) for last three or so releases. Barometer and Banana had a several good tracks, but nothing like the stuff that made us all Buffett fans to begin with. Didn't think it could get any worse after Fruitcakes. I was wrong. I know he is getting older (like the rest of us) and his music will change, but like this! Bad music, and even worse lyrics. If it wasn't for ""I will play for Gumbo"" I would have given this turkey one star. Save the cash, get one of pre 90s releases if you don't have them already. Jimmy, back to the beach already!"
1,Very very inaccurate!,"I was expecting this thermometer to be somewhat inaccurate, like +/- 2 degrees or so. But it's off by over 10 degrees! What's worse is there is absolutely no way to calibrate it. The plastic case seems to be glued or welded together -- impossible to open it without destroying it."
2,"Great Looking, Easy to Read, but Inaccurate","This is a nice looking wall thermometer, and it certainly was inexpensive, but I guess you can't expect perfection for the price. It seems to be accurate sometimes, but even in the shade, it was giving higher temps by ten or fifteen degrees outside... I think it's too easily affected by the heat of the wall... but since it's intended to hang on the wall, not sure how else to do it? It might be better inside. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,indoor-outdoor thermometer,"I received it and the hand to tell temperature was broken off. I sent it back, got a new one and the attachment to hang it up on the back was upside down so to hang it up the numbers would be upside down. My husband decided just to put a different attachment on it rather than send it back again. Very flimsy."
3,Not as good as the previous time around.....,"Rockapella needs to get back to making really great CD's like ""Dont Tell Me You Do"" and ""2"". The original Christmas CD was great, but this one doesnt have the same feel, because it feels like its already been done. With the past four Rockapella releases being a concert, a ""tribute to summer"", and 2 Christmas CD's, Rockapella needs to go back into the studio and write some all original stuff so they can put out a great 5-star record again."
2,"Not a 'real' RAZR, poor performance, not worth it!","Verizon's CDMA phones all have external antennas. This RAZR V3c doesn't which explains it's poor performance. It has weak reception compared to other Verizon phones, and very poor battery life.I think Verizon only lobbied to carry this phone because of the popularity of the RAZR on GSM networks such as T-Mobile and Cingular. Note that the GSM networks don't require an external antenna and also those phones are typically smaller and lighter as well.Which brings me to my final point-this RAZR V3c isn't even the same size as the GSM RAZR, it's larger and heavier! So, while this phone says ""RAZR"" it's really a different phone than the slim, light and tiny GSM RAZR that is so popular everywhere."
4,Pink and loving it!,"I have had the pink razr for several months now and have been pretty pleased with it. I waited several months before purchasing it upon hearing rumors that it wasn't exactly the greatest phone. Finally when the price went down I decided to take the plunge anyway. I must admit my needs are pretty simple- give me something sleek, pink, functional and pink and I will love it- and I did! I am also a ringtones junkie and have been very impressed by the sound quality of my ringtones- although the con being that I haven't been able to find COOL free ringtones yet (You have to pay for the VCAST pack)The only downer I have experienced with the pink razr is not the phone itself but to pink bluetooth motorola headset that matches it. While it looks cool the maximum volume is too low, even with other verizon customers."
2,"good at first, but i wouldnt reccomend it","well im 16 [writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account] and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink, but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it. first off, it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen, and that takes forever, the phone in general is slow. also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece. Im stuck with this phone for a while, and am not to happy with it."
3,VIBRATE AND RING PLEASE!,"I love this phone. I didn't pay full price for it (don't). I love the color, and the reception so far is better than my LG phone. It also doesn't make the annoying high pitched buzing tone my LG did. The battery life could be better, but it hasn't died on me yet.I really wish I could make mine vibrate and ring at the same time. People say you can, but I don't know how. Please, if you know how, email me at Actress99@aol.com. PLEASE!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,"I have had to exchange my Pink Verizon Motorola Razr 3 times!!!!!! Luckily I purchased the insurance.... I'm going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr (this last phone only lasted a few weeks!)... This time I am asking for different phone. The phone works fine then all of sudden one day, 1/2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the ""#"" is on the screen and you can't get to anything.... No phone numbers, no voicemail, no text messages, nothing!!!! It is extremely frustrating. What is the point of a cute phone that doesn't work."
1,Yes it's pink...but it doesn't work well,"I bought this phone because I HAD to have a pink phone. So now I have a cute, CRAPPY phone. There's no antenna on the phone so reception is poor. If my car breaks down in a remote area I will probably have no way to make an emergency contact. The sound in the earpiece is especially poor. I am constantly saying, ""what? what?"" during calls. The battery is small so the phone only lasts me from morning to late afternoon and I am not a huge talker. I wish I had done more research on this phone because now I have to live with it for two years. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! I have never owned a worse phone. I will never purchase ANYTHING from Motorola again."
4,I love my pretty pink girly phone,"I've had my pink Razr for two weeks and really haven't had any problems, other than one incident where the bluetooth absolutely refused to release the phone until I walked sixty feet away from it. Other than that, great little phone. I like the keypad a lot, much better than my previous phone's teeny little buttons. I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions. I'm not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from unless they shipped some defective phones. And it's pretty, too!"
4,pretty in pink,i pretty much love the phone...i just got it and the only thing thats tough is figuring out all it does...i dont like the fact that there isnt any flash for the camera but other than that im happy with my phone...just make sure if u do buy the phone that you dont pay the full price at verizon which is over $420...i got my on ebay for $295:)
2,Looks nice in the picture.,"Looks great in the picture. For the price it seems like a nice deal, but it is in fact very cheap looking in person. The clock it 3 inches thick and all made of cardboard except the metal ring. You should really find another photo of this clock because the amazon picture doesn't tell the whole story.I'm still going to put it somewhere around the house, just buyer beware."
3,Latin psalms and Marian motets,"A theoretical reconstruction of what Handel's 1707 Roman vespers might have sounded like. A selection of large scale Latin psalms (HWV 232 237 243 238 235 240 241) originally recorded in 1987 for EMI's now defunct Reflexe label.Parrott marshalls a famous cast including Emma Kirkby, Emily van Evera, Mary Nichols and David Thomas. The black mark (again Mr Branson) no texts. Fair enough most listeners to this repertoire know the words to Nisi Dominus and Salve Regina, but who knows the lyrics to Saeviat tellus inter rigores? Can't help but feel Virgin are being cheap on us here."
3,good but not great,"Handel's Carmelite Vespers are beautiful, and should be better known.This is a good recording, previously released on EMI.Handel: Carmelite Vespers, 1707But I fear it is not a great one.In fact, I far prefer the out-of-print RCA release of Michael Korn conducting the Philadelphia Singers and Concerto Soloists Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia.Handel: Roman VespersIt sends chills down my spine. This recording does not.Eric Alan Isaacson"
1,"Fine voices, fine orchestra, lousy interpretation, bad recording","As with many recordings of this period of music, there is a shrillness to the sound that is at best off-putting. I got tired of it barely two sections in. I understand about period instruments and period performance technique and have sung many Handel works accordingly. Historical accuracy is important, yet in this recording many fine voices, including those of the chorus, seem wasted, sacrificed on the altar of a false sense of hisorical accuracy gone to the brink of charicature. The sound is dry and brittle, not at all full of the life that Handel breathed into all his work. Listen to several other recordings if you can, then preview some of the portions of this recording before you buy."
5,"Great scope, seller needs to be called before ordering","The is hands down the best SCOUT style scope on the market, and will likely remain so. The Burris Scope is almost as good, and a few dollars cheaper, but why settle for ""almost as good?"" The HI-Lux/Leatherwood scope is inferior and variable eye-relief/magnification is not workable in a scout setup; it is likely far more fragile owning to its variable components. I have tried all three as well as a Simmons pistol scope. When building a scout rifle, this is the Scope to get. Do not get a pistol-style scope: the Eye relief is too long. Do not get some cheap Chinese garbage--you will not be happy, or be able to use it effectively, and you will have wasted your $50-100. Save up and get a quality scope!"
5,Great scope.,I love this scope the folks that made it should be proud! There is a lot of junk scopes out there and they will let you down when you need them most like they have me do not be tempted by that cheaply made China junk !! Pay the money for the good stuff let those slaves of the peoples Republic keep that crap!
1,Absolutely horrible,"I was so unbelievably disappointed in this CD! If I had wanted to hear kid singing pop songs poorly, I would have bought Kidz Bop. The whole point of Broadway Kids is that they sing BROADWAY! The ""Broadway Kids"" do NOT have pop voices. It is truly unbearable to listen to, with the exception of Bouncing Off the Ceiling, which is really cute. But Michael Shulman simply MUST stop recording with them! He is NOT CUTE anymore and has a horrible pubescent voice. Let's hope they go back to recording what they are known for, which is BROADWAY."
3,"Okay, so I liked it...","...but you probably should not buy the DVD!This is a streaming-only movie. There's a lot of cynicism of corporate ""culture"" that cuts right to the funny bone, especially if you've ever spent your day in a cubicle. The sci-fi element is pretty scetchy, with lots of cheap effects - and I do mean cheap - and overall bad acting. But if you're in the mood to get together with like-minded friends and do your own MST3000 night, this is a good movie to go with. And, frankly, I've seen worse on a much bigger budget (Battlefield Earth, anyone?). Break out the popcorn and beer and have fun with this mangy-but-lovable dog!"
1,Low budget camp,"Looks like some bored college students got together to make a film. The acting is virtually non-existent; the plot is predictable; the special effects are laughable. Don't waste your time or money on this.OK we have an evil corporation and a bunch of clueless (and not particularly likable) characters with a couple of marauding monsters who tear people apart, but only some people. We have a simple mystery about a missing Mars Base One, and we have a lot of film shot in a gravel pit with a red filter over the lens.This film is about as low budget as it gets. The actors do try to camp it up a bit to save the film, but the acting is really bad. If you feel compelled to see this film, rent it for a dollar rather than buying it."
1,One word...HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"Watch the first 10 mins, and you'll realize how bad it is. I could'nt make it past the first 30 mins. It was a bad attempt at making a throwback 1960's ""Space Flick"". Bad actors, bad scenery, bad storyline. The world of space horror has crashed and burned in recent years, and this is just more proof of that. The last really good one was ""Event Horizon"" from the late 90's. If you want a good Space Horror Flick go watch it. Or Pitch Black, or Galaxy of Terror, or Horror Planet, or one of the Alein Movies. Anything is better than this load of crap. Trust me, I'm a Horror movie buff. I'm sure there is an over paid film critic who thinks this is genious, but for regular folk like you & me it isn't worth our time."
1,Couldn't Finish It,"I tried. I really tried. I put it through my hipster filter, my irony filter, my compassion filter and still couldn't finish watching this. I must now be officially an old fogie. Oh well. They (and I) gave it the old college try. Unfortunately we must have gone to different old colleges together."
3,"Might be rating a little premature, I might do 4 stars later","The plastic seemed too thin and like it might break. But we put a four horse CM trailer on it in gravel and it held fine. I just am not ready to believe it will work out in the sun. We are in the Southwest and sun kills everything.So I am being pessimistic, but hopeful that it will last in the sun, but again it is thinner than I thought.Not heavy, works better than I thought. So I will update in a few months and let you know."
3,CAMCO WHEEL DOCK,"VERY CLEVER DEVICE. THE WHEEL REALLY STAYS PUT,AND GIVES GREATER STABILITY TO TO TOUNG OF THE TRAILER. GREAT IDEA THANKS BRIAN A"
2,Too expensive,Can buy a much cheaper version of this at Wal-Mart that works just as good.But I use it on my boat trailer and it works as advertised.
4,Good Haydn introduction,"This disc is a very good introduction to some of Haydn's works. Of course, any composer who wrote as much as Haydn can never have even pieces of all their best works on one CD, but this one does a good job of getting a little of everything. The recordings are all very good, and the liner notes are very informative."
5,Challenging made easy,"As an avid consumer of Indian foods, my biggest frustration is in not being able to re-produce what I love to eat. With Ms. Bhide's The Spice is Right book, I found that my 2 left thumbs in the kitchen were a thing of the past. The recipes are delightful, easy to follow and I also enjoy the thoughful comments the author shares regarding herself and the history of her recipes. As a Weight Watcher, I especially appreciate the caloric/protein/fat and carb breakdowns. My favourite recipe is the Spicy Chicken Bake (Tandoori Chicken). Yummy and simple!"
1,Why would anyone buy this book ?,"This is one of the worst Indian cooking books I have read. ... The recipes are hardly Indian in terms of names or even how they are cooked. Example is a recipe of turkey. Indians don't eat turkey and if you were to go to India and ask for the dish that the author mentions, the people will think you are crazy. This book kind of gives bad name to Indian cooking. If you want to really spend the money buying a cookbook check out something by Madhur Jafferey or Julie Sahni."
4,DSM-520,The interface has the graphics of a CGA display. The function of the unit is good. I have had only two lockups.
2,No good for iTunes media,"What a fantastic concept... the ability to stream the media you store on your computers to your home entertainment system. The problem is that if you purchase most of your media from iTunes this device is a $200 dust collector, because it can't play your iTunes media. You would think that they would have had the foresight to find a way to make the unit work with this media. Even the USB port on the device didn't allow a direct connect to an iPod.It was also pretty slow to recognize commands from the supplied remote and the connection to the wireless network was unstable at times - despite an excellent signal on our laptops from the same location.Overall, I was VERY disappointed but look forward to future revisions and product enhancements because I think the concept is fantastic."
2,D-Link DSM-520,"After having found the first shipment of my order dated 12/17/2007 which I had to return as defective due to the Output from the HDMI not working. I returned the first unit and received a replacement from Electronica on January 12. After connecting I found this defective also and have requested a RMAR from Electronica for a full refund.I do not know whether it is Electronica or D-Link at fault but after having paid over $60.00 in shipping costs, I am not satisfied with the service I have been given.D-Link DSM-520 MediaLounge Wireless HD Media Player"
1,bad experiecne,"I expected to use USB interface to load photos and videos. The bad news is that the speed of USB interface is too slow. It can only support bitrate lower than 800kbps. It will be stuck once the bitrate of the video is higher. That doesn't make sense. I emailed this problem to service, no response.Several months later, the LED for power indicator didn't work anymore.It is really a bad experience."
2,Doesnt Play HD only outputs in HD - Good Standard Player,"Bought this product to stream HD media from PC/USB Storage. All though advertised on the box and website it does not play the HD media. I tried to play the media from all 3 available inputs (802.11(wireless), Ethernet, and USB HD) and several formats that are supported (avi,mpeg2,ts,mp4). The HD movies were choppy at best. Plays all other non HD videos without a problem. Divx videos as well(even though it doesn't say it plays them on the box). Worked well with 500GB USB Drive but not needed. Would not recommend because HD feature is useless. Dlink technical support said to take it back to the store. There technical support grade is D- ."
1,Waster of a weekend,"Bought it on a Friday night. Spent 3 hours Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday trying to get everything to work. It took 3 tech people and an hour on hold for them to confirm that there were no upgrades to the software to support M4A files. Not that it's just grabbing files from itunes, but when I just rip a regular CD, it also stores as an M4A file. So, my music was useless on the machine.So, now I'm just left with viewing my photos. That's ok. I can deal with that. However, the help for getting a connection to your wireless networks (both the on line help and on the phone help, mind you) was useless. After 6 hours of getting ""No server found"", I packed it in and returned the item."
4,Excellent product with few drawbacks,"I really like this product, it does exactly what you need it to do: stream videos to your TV, and it does it very well. If you have any problems with a missing codec just convert to DivX and it works fine.It also connects to the Internet on its own without needing your computer to be turned on, but it only streams radio when you do that. Not much of a drawback but actual Internet content without needing your computer as a ""jump point"" would make it five stars for me."
3,MediaLounge-not camera ready yet,"I was looking for a product that would improve upon the wireless interface of the ROKU media server and provide an easy way to display high definition images from my PC based photo library onto my HDTV. The good news is that the wireless interface worked better than expected and that while imperfect was very acceptable for use. Instructions were reasonably clear and customer support was available, although with some wait. The bad news is that I could not get the device to display high resolution photos in true HI DEF on my 52"" screen without image distortion. After repeated conversations with customer support it became clear the software was not fully developed and custom settings to obtain the results I wanted were not available. So I returned the unit. Amazon's return process was smooth. Media Lounge has great potential and I would consider purchasing it again in the future if enhancements are made."
5,Best media player,"Excellent sound, videos, and pictures playing off your PC via wired or wireless connections. Video seems to work best with a 100Mbps wired connection into a PC. The optical audio makes the sound quality excellent on your stereo! I have mine connected to an HDTV and looks perfect.Worth every dollar spent, do not bother looking at other vendors or models, the D-link DSM-520 is the best in its price range!"
4,Media Player,"Works very well both wired and wireless. One issue is that it will not play Windows Media Files created using Windows Vista Ultimate/Media Player Codecs. Needs a firmware upgreade that is not yet available I believe. Otherwise I am very, very pleased with it."
4,Nice product for viewing video,"I purchased this product basicaly for viewing movies converted from DVD to AVI. So far I have no complains at all. Even using wireless, its performance is very good. There are some minor issues that don't impact the utilization."
4,I could not ask for anything better!,"I bought this item, because the xbox 360 wireless unit was terrible. Even with the extremely limited media I could stream, the 360 wireless unit would buffer every few seconds. I finaly decided to dump it when it all of a sudden didn't recognize my entire music library.From the opening of the box it only took 15-20 minutes to get the network hooked up. It recognizes every video and music file I have, and plays them without hesitation. The only negative it has is the interface can be slugish, and a couple times I had to turn off the unit.Anyone who would give this one or two stars has no experience in dealing with wireless media. The fact is that Wi-Fi is an extremly unreliable connection. If you are streaming media, you are going to occasionally have problems.DSM-520 may not be perfect, but it meets all my needs."
2,Not real HD player.,It will play limited HD files but it will NOT play MKV files or even WMA with HD sound. Due this these limitations I returned this produced and got Popcorn Hour A-100 that plays every media file.
4,Great streaming solution,"I was skeptic that this device will actually deliver, but the price was low enough to try. To make a long story short, I eventually bought a second one.The good:It streams video even on 802.11b, at sharp resolution.The bad:If the signal is too low, it may stop the streaming, and recovery is somewhat painful.You have to choose between fast forward (a very slow one) and search (painfully providing the exact time to skip to). I guess it has something to do with copyright, but it is still beyond my understanding why you cannot have them both, as they are assigned to different buttons.It works well only with D-Link media server, and oly with the latest version. I believe this version is the last one (they move to ActiveTV) so don't expect to get support for new filetypes.Bottom line:This list of bads is long, only because this device is so useful. I have two, and will stick with it for a long time."
4,Good product,"Good product but needs to be played with -- much longer learning curve than a simple player. Plays file types as described by manual and dlink website and has its limitations. However, I'm enjoying more and more as I figure out its capabilities."
3,Great for what it will do,"My family gave me the DSM-520 for fathers day, while it did an admirable job streaming the content from our server and was easy to set up, the limited types of HD movies it would stream made me look further.I returned the unit and ordered a popcorn hour that has played everything I could throw at it, MKV being most important to me. A note is that it is a more geeky machine and not as easy to setup properly although there is a great forum for assistance.For my non-geek friends I would point them to the DLink DSM-520, for the geeker bunch popcorn hour wins.Mind you popcorn does not have native wireless and does not do music or images as well as the DLink, that said, you can add a hard drive to the popcorn hour eliminating the need to stream files and allowing it to act as a torrent downloader."
1,Lousy performance,"I bought this product back in December '07 and have yet to get it to work properly. The player is very slow and loses signal, or has to re-buffer constantly. It can't even get through an entire song without stopping a couple of times, then it just freezes and requires a restart. I've installed the newest firmware, but that hasn't fixed anything. Customer support assumes that I'm an idiot and that it's my fault that the media player isn't working right. It'll sometimes let me stream Rhapsody music through it, but then decides to stop working. The USB port works only periodically as well. Wish I would have taken this back a long time ago."
2,Save your money,"I have to be honest that when i bought this device, i was excited having read so many great reviews. However, upon receiving it, I started using it and was very disappointed. The player is very slow connecting to your network, and then loses the connection every once in a while just for the heck of it. The user interface is somewhat confusing and is slow to respond to remote commands. Also, the little blue light on the front that indicates network transmission is a very bright blue, thats gets annoying after a few minutes. A piece of electrical tape to cover it is a must. I purchased this to take the place of my XBOX 360's media playback functions. It was once I recieved this player that I realized just how good the XBOX 360's media functions were. Save your money, and buy an XBOX 360...You wont be disappointed in the XBOX."
2,not good,"This unit is missing many popular audio and video formats, missing music formats like m4a / acc files .. this is a default if your files are from ITunes..Missing video formats are not able to play iso images, playing vob files is a pain, you'll have to select each vob fileThe ActiveTV video aspect format is wrong when using 1080, the ActiveTv channels are poor quality and slow loading.The box locked up a few times. DLink tech support is poor, they constantly put you on hold for 5+ minutes, poor english.Checkout Popcorn Hour instead"
1,A tragic waste of raw material.,"I can't believe there are positive reviews of this horrid piece of junk. The box is a complete waste of valuable materials. The engineers responsible for this design, most probably do not have TV's and have probably never seen and HDTV. The box is painfully slow to do anything. The photograph rendering is horrid and very, very prone to distortion. The current firmware v1.02 only allows a 420 line resolution when using HDMI output. The box hangs when trying to play high bit rate MP3's and the text on the remote is unreadable in any but the brightest light.I wish I had seen a demo before I purchased this. It was a mistake."
2,A lot improvements is needed,"Hook up and get it runing in less than half hour, mostly waiting for the midea server to install and update.However, here are some shortcomings:1. Unlike some reviewer had indicated, the unit does require the Media server to run on a PC. It does not connect to you network storage without MediaLounge server running on a PC.2. Many of my video clips(mpeg) does not work with the unit even though all midea player I used on PC had no issue with them.3. It does not support RMVB.4. Not much options for picture slide show.5. The network activity indicator is really anoying as it flashes when there is network activity. You really has to block the indicator when you play a movie ...6. I am not impressed with the vedio quality."
2,The DSM-320 has the same flaws.,"I was impressed by R.A. Edington's review of the DSM-520. I am putting in this comment because I recently bought a DSM-320, and had many of the same issues. I am disappointed that Dlink has not fixed these problems in the DSM-520, which I was considering buying, but have decided to hold off on until they fix the serious shortcomings. I am sorry to say that poor quality seems to be on the rise, especially with regard to devices that have a large software component, like the DSM-520. For example, I bought an HP iPAQ hx4700, a top of the line PDA. It had many software problems until I upgraded the firmware - AND it took a very long time for HP to provide the fixes. Shame on these and other manufacturers who take short cuts and leave us to deal with the mess. Good quality is expected up front, not a nice to have."
1,DSM520 - Just doesn't work with a lot of DRM,"I would not recommend this to anyone who isn't a computer person who can patiently troubleshoot.It does not work with Yahoo Music, NBC Video, Amazon Digital Download videos...I wasted my time and money. It's not maturing fast enough."
3,Not Used Much,Nice product but it gets boring after a while. Didn;t use it as much as i thought i would. Maybe I'll buy again when the price drops.
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Don't listen to the positive reviews, those people are willing to put up with a LOT of drawbacks to solve very particular problems.No one here has complained about a few things that really irk me.1. MPEG2 support - Dlink claims it, but since FF/RW do NOT work with MPEG2 I think they need to put lots of little asteriks by the word ""support"".2. The remote is pathetic! The layout is awful, and the most used buttons are very small and grouped closely and incoherently.3. File names, on the screen the 520 truncates filenames to about 31 characters. I've got a whole screen full of ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart-"" without any way to tell the recording dates, etc. Even the ""info"" button just mimics the file name length."
1,Great Concept. Piece of Junk.,I have never been a DLink fan but I was intrigued by the media player. I have literally spent days fooling with this device. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. The device always comes on and connects to the media server pc but will not always connect to the Active TV service. All software and firmware are up to date. DLink support is uselessly non-reponsive. I install and manage networks so I have a high patience tolerance for configuring but I have wanted to take a hammer to this thing on more than one occassion. Save your money and buy a different product.
5,Works perfectly...,"Very easy to set up (5 minutes). I recommend updating the desktop software to the latest version as it has some improvements. This thing is flat out easy to use and works flawlessly. When the price drops back down to what I bought it for, I will be buying another one for another TV. Streams music and plays movies without one single hiccup over my wireless G network."
4,Very Solid Product,"Out of all the media server type devices, this one seemed to be the best reviewed so I took a flyer and bought it. It is not the simplest thing to set up. I had to install, uninstall and download and reinstall the latest versions of both the device firmware and PC based software. This may had to do with the fact I was using Vista. Once I got it all settled in though, I find it works great. I have the device on the 2nd floor of my house and my wireless router is in my basement and this doesn't seem to create any issues. I did notice recorded TV shows that are in uncompressed 2gig per hour formats did not stream over well, compressing them to iPod TV size makes them work flawlessly.I am using it on a 25 inch, non-HD tv so I can't speak to how well the HD works.Overall I am very happy with the purchase though and would recommend to anyone looking to have a Tivo-like device."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is my first foray into the media server arena. [...] so I wasn't expecting the world which was good because I didn't get it. The setup was not for the faint of heart although I did get it all working. I have an old TV (ca. 1995) so no video for me. Wireless just didn't fly so I wired it. I am quite happy with what it does which is play all my music, show photos and allow me to access some internet radio.Pros: Price, music is easy to access and play--rip all those CDs and get rid of themCons: Dlink's horrible, horrible support, limited internet access, setup not easyI was hassled by Live365 when I tried to claim the 30 day free trial that came with it so I finally gave up on those idiots. They claimed the serial number was not right. What can I tell you? I am reading it off the box.Ironically I got the best advice and tech support from these reviews. Thanks guys."
4,Good device !,"Using this with Linksys Nas200 in a wireless network since nov/08. No problem to play avi, wmv, mp3s , noticed no lag. Only accessing photos the device is slow. Remember to update the firmware before starts the real use ;)The remote control don't have a strong signal but you can setup one universal r/c and throw away the d-link r/c. I can't understand a nice device with such bad r/c, very nice to use as paper weight!I recommend this but buy one universal remote control too !Setup isn't so complicated, but user needs some knowledge of networks. I have mine ready to work 20 minutes after out the box (with firmware update)."
3,"Very similar to MY DAD, THE COACH","The Tigers soccer team loses every game and have few skills to help them win. To make things worse, the dad who becomes coach knows little about the sport. Dad gets lucky because famous football coach, Mike Ditka, lives next door and agrees to help coach the team. After giving motivational speeches and putting the team through drills, the Tigers still lose games.Ditka has an idea. He introduces the coach Dad to two kids who work in their uncle's butcher shop. Soon enough, the team learns the new kids play well and begins winning games. The coaches tell the boys to get the ball to the two kids and let them take care of the rest. It highlights the team and the road they take to start winning games.The book targets kids ages four through eight, uses color photos from the movie and readable text for emerging readers."
3,Not quite,"It is a good movie. I only gave it three stars because I really got tired of the grieving mother.The film is about how a fatal accident forever changes the lives of three families. It is a story about the search for forgiveness and redemption. It is also a story about how some people let tragedy destroy themselves and those who love them.There is an unforgiving grieving mother; a forgotten surviving son; a teenager who made a fatal mistake trying to impress his not-so-perfect best friend; a lonely stepmother; a narcissistic father who cannot connect with his son or new wife; a depressed college professor who no longer has anything in common with his wife and who hates his job; a mentally ill man who is struggling with his own demons; and the girlfriend of the deceased who has already moved on.The actor who played the man with agoraphobia and other mental illnesses did a superb job.The tags ""transsexual"" and ""Jessica Lange"" have nothing to do with this movie."
1,Very Disappointing Book,"A disappointing book that made me wonder how five authors could collaborate and come up with nothing new? They state the obvious: that students who don't speak English or who are struggling readers might have trouble navigating a math text, but they provide few real solutions. Perhaps elementary teachers might get something from this, but I would advise 6-12 teachers to skip this one."
4,A Sweet Romance!,"This novel is a very sweet romance. I prefer strong character development and actual romance to heaving bosoms and inappropriate-for-time-period morals, so this is right up my alley.Betty Neels has written many doctor-nurse romances (or doctor-typist, in this case). Charity is a typist at a hospital who is hired by Dr. Wyllie-Lyons, a reserved and gentlemanly doctor. While working for him, they fall in love and enjoy a gentle, old-fashioned courtship. While Charity is a bit too much of a dependent character for my tastes, the book is still very cute. The characters could be a bit stronger, but overall this book was a fun way to pass an afternoon."
5,Didn't want it to end!,"I couldn't put this one down. In this book, Betty Neels does not make us privy to Jake Wyllie-Lyon's feelings or thoughts. However, there are many hints and suggestions and it is quite clear that he has been watching our heroine Charity for a while and is very interested. He decides to offer her a job as his secretary but it soon becomes increasingly difficult for him to separate his professional life and his desire to be the love of her life - so many kisses. The book is full of very touching moments between the two as we feel the tension building. This one is on my list of favorites!"
4,commentary tracks blow,"I would have to say that, all things considered, this is probably the strongest South Park season they've done: it includes so many classic episodes and only a couple of duds.The thing that disappointed me was the commentary tracks by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Instead of commenting throughout the length of each episode (as they did in the beginning), they've reached the point where they only talk for about the first five minutes of each episode, then check out, leaving you with nothing but the normal audio. I found this lazy, unprofessional, and unimaginative. There were so many things they could have talked about. Even the few points they make are either common knowledge or obvious."
4,SOUTH PARK TENTH,"This is one of the better season of South Park, for the most part the series has gotten better as the seasons go on. This season has two of the best episodes of South Park, which makes it worth the purchase just for that. The episode with Cartman playing the Bounty Hunter Dog..as a hall monitor, I can't articulate just how funny it is, but trust me..it's classic. The other great one is the one when the boys are trying to get rid of a character that infultrated their video game, I laughed so hard as they got fatter and fatter in the process. Im sure if your a fan of the show you know you can watch all the episodes for free online..but if your just wanting to have a season of the show, this a good choice."
2,Jumped shark,"When it comes to my South Park DVD collection, I stopped with season 9. I loved the ep with the dog whisperer, and the wii and hybrid car episodes were okay, but the other ones were pretty lame. I have never been a big fan of towlie.I don't know what people saw in the video game episode...I thought it was one of the worst episodes the show has ever done. IT WAS SO BORING. Like 6 other shows have done an episode with the very same premise, which was not even interesting the first time."
2,Disappointing,"Judging by the other reviews here, I guess I'm in the minority here, but I must say: This is most the disappointing season of South Park ever. For the record, I own seasons one through nine on DVD. Several of those I bought without first viewing the seasons in their entirety, just because I had faith that most, if not all, of the episodes would be entertaining.Alas, my luck didn't hold out. Nearly all of these episodes elicited far less laughter than those from previous seasons. Some were downright lame and/or boring, lacking much of the wit and intelligent political commentary I've come to appreciate from South Park. The notable exception is the now-classic World of Warcraft episode."
4,Another Awesome Season!!!,"This season is not as good as other seasons, but it's still alright. One of my favorite episodes is when it's HALLOWEEN and Satan is throwing a big Sweet Sixteen party and acts like a spoiled rich teenager. Also Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny deal with the death of their friend Chef, stop Manbearpig, try to get a Family Guy episode pulled, defeat a nerdy gamer on World of Warcraft, and stop Ike from having sexual relations with his smokin' hot teacher. (Nice!) All this and more happen in SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE 10TH SEASON!!!"
3,"Quick download, hard to move off your computer","I purchased this with the idea of putting it on my Sony PSP, and i found it to be nearly impossible to transfer the file to anything. I payed for a special software, and even that couldn't help me. If you just want to watch the show on your computer, its fine, but otherwise, buy it somewhere else."
5,Just keeps getting better..,"Like every one of its previous 9 seasons (released on DVD), Season 10 doesn't fail to deliver the ultimate in politically incorrect but oh so relevant satire. The subjects are becoming, if not even more taboo, then at least more linked to the pulse of some of modern society's most important issues. All this delivered in a side-splitting package of laughter and fun."
4,SOUTH PARK,THIS IS AN OK SHOW IT IS SOMETIMES FUNNY AND SOMETIMES GROSS. SOMETIMES THE HUMOR IS SO WAY OVER BOARD BUT AREN'T MOST SHOWS? I WATCH SOUTH PARK BECAUSE MY HUSBAND LOVES IT BUT I STILL DON'T LIKE SOME OF THE HUMOR BUT IT IS STILL OK
1,Not nearly as funny as previous seasons,"I don't know what happened but Season 10 is not at all as funny as the previous seasons. Perhaps it was too political for my tastes, or the fact that is skewered more to right wing arguments (no hybrid cars, anti-evolution, a lame Gore joke, etc) but it seemed a lot more juvenile than its previous incarnations. Some of the episodes were funny like the Dog Whisperer and killer gamer ones, but for the most part, this season was just off."
4,Good season bad extras,This was a pretty good season of South Park. Unfortunately just like the last few seasons out on DVD this one is lacking in the extras. The only real extras are the commentary's. If your a die hard South Park fan and can't live without a season your probably going to buy it anyways. If your not sure about buying this it is very similar to the last few seasons.
5,Great Season,"I, too, was disappointed in the censored version of Cartoon Wars. I guess we have free speech unless it involves Mohammad. It also shows that Comedy Central has more respect for Mohammad than it does of any other religious figure. (Think about it, just seems weird that you make fun of everything else and have other religious figures crapping on things and looking stupid, but when it comes to Mohammad....whoa....can't do anything to upset the Mohammad followers....we might offend them and they might blow our cities up. Comedy Central allowed SouthPark to offend everyone else at one time or another, why is Mohammad different?)"
4,An interesting landscape of India,"I enjoyed reading this and following the character around the streets and politics of India. Anamika is a young sexually curious girl who explores her sexuality within three lesbian relationships she carries on at the same time. She feels comforted by her servant, is in love with her classmate and in lust with a very sexy older woman who she names India. The scope of the story is enlarged by some plot diversion using a caste issue with a boy in her school. This is an engaging book worth the time it takes to read.Myne WhitmanA Heart to Mend"
4,"Not quite Lolita, but still quite good","I recently finished Babyji by Abha Dawesar. The review snippit on the front cover starts out, ""If Lolita had grown up in India..."" And I suppose that's a fair asumption. I love Nabokov, so I figured, why not? The heroine in this book, although young does not equate herself with Lolita and niether do I. She equates herself more with Humphrey. I don't know if I'd agree with that, but she does seem much more on the ball than Lolita. She's a very intelligent girl who through out the course of the book, becomes aware and quite comfortable with her sexuality. I don't know if I would call this a ""coming of age"" story, though."
2,Definitely not a page turner,"I bought this book with great anticipation; I was greatly disappointed. Someone said earlier that the book seems like a slice of the character's life with no ups and downs. That's true. There is no climax, no story line that grips you.At some points I was irritated by the number of times people called the character 'mature' when there was nothing to show to the readers that she was mature.The idea of story is good- sex in the mind of an Indian lesbian teenager. It is just not well written."
3,Super Winch 3000,"So far so good as operations go however a bit disappointed that it says in the Product Description... ""Includes 15 foot handheld remote"" and this was not included. Also a bit noisy but does the job. Also does not come with the plug and power installed or available, had to wire it totally ......this may be because it is for 115 or 220V."
5,a must for western gardeners,"This is my second copy of the Sunset Western Garden Book. The old copy is tattered and currently in my trunk. That way I am sure to have a reliable reference when I have the urge to purchase a plant. I have only come across one plant that wasn't listed. (Sunset, why did you dis the Dombeya?)Lots of great photos and tips. It has everything from anatomy to xylem and zones.It's not just a reference book but an education in gardening."
5,The first book we consult at the nursery.,"This book does not contain all of the plants for sale in the world, but every plant in the book IS available from nurseries in the west. Having worked at a prominent nursery in San Diego CA, I can tell you that it is the first book we consult for information on plants.It is an all-inclusive book, with guides for planting situations, many cross-indexes, basic gardening practices, etc. Under ""Grapes"", there is an entire page (p.370) devoted to trellises and the training of grape vines. The drawings and discussion are the best I've ever seen."
5,A MUST HAVE PLANT REF. BOOK,"THIS BOOK HAS EVERYTHING. GREAT PICTURES AND LOTS OF PLANT AND PLANTING INFORMATION. SUNSET PUB. HAS DONE IT AGAIN. I STILL HAVE MY OLD SUNSET WESTERN GARDEN BOOK AND IT'S MORE THAN 20 YRS OLD. IF YOU NEED TO ADD A BOOK TO YOUR LIBRARY, THIS IS THE ONE. - DAVID H./CALIF. DESIGNER"
5,Awesome book,In my experience western garden is the best gardening book on the planet. Just my humble opinion. This book is well used in our home and I've even loaned it to friends looking for plants to landscape with for our area. It's beautifully illustrated as well. When I wear this one out I will absolutely buy another one!
2,"The ""C"" Planes","I was expecting a book on par with the work of Lloyd S. Jones' books on fighters and bombers. Unfortunately this book falls far short of that standard. While it's good to have a single source for basic information it offers little else. The photos are of poor quality in many cases and the layout makes it difficult to follow. It seems like this book was done with minimal research, many entries have nothing but basic information and the selection of photos is not very good. In short, this is not the definitive work on C planes."
3,"Informative, well illustrated - but suffers from POOR prose","This work warrants three stars on the merit of its relatively little-explored subject matter and often excellent photo selections. The authors do a fine job casting light on many lesser-known but intriguing air transport projects, as well as showcasing the more familiar US airlifters. Unfortunately, the authors' attempt at a conversational (as opposed to documentary) prose style savagely detracts from the work. Reading the text was a vexing chore. With stringent editing, ""C-Planes"" could have been a real gem."
3,Full Soundtrack,It should be noted that this cd is not the music from these shows but the entire audio track of the shows. Tracks one and two are each aproxamately 25 minutes and together are the enire audio of santa claus is comin to town. tracks three and four are the entire audio from frosty. Five and Six are the songs santa claus is comin to town and frosty the snowman (respectively).
3,"Classic Stories, Poor CD...","...The stories are enjoyable and the voice talent is fantasic, except in this version of ""Frosty"" we hear the June Foray/Paul Frees versions of the childrens' voices. There has been a lot of griping that these actors sessions were not used in the final cut of the film and there is even some talk of reinstating them into the film as a ""Special Edition"". However there was a very good reason these actors' recordings were redone for the film, as talented as Frees and Foray are, they are not very good in these roles. The Paul Frees lines makes one laugh that anyone thought these were believable voices for kids. June Foray's Karen sounds flat and often uninteresting, however her groans and grunts stayed in the final film.If you'd like to have these films for car trips or to listen to on your computer, then you may want to purchase this disc. If you desire something more, then this is not the disc for you."
4,"Fine Weber and Crusell Clarinet Concerti from Pay, etc.","I am not familiar with any of the works on this excellent inexpensive 2 CD set, but am pleased that the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment sounds superb under Pay's direction. His clarinet playing is fine, especially with a period instrument, but stylistically it doesn't break any new ground here. I am disappointed that the liner notes are rather sparse, even if this is a budget reissue of both of these early digital recordings. Still I would recommend this CD set if you are interested in hearing concerti not composed by Haydn, Mozart or the early Beethoven."
4,"Uneven, but Worthy","Williams' songs are idiosyncratic, to say the least, which means that some of the artists here fail to connect with the material. Check out Lou Reed and Giant Sand's ponderous selections for the ugly details. However, there are some fine things, too, not the least of which is Maria McKee's barn-burning title track, the only cover to actually improve upon the original. Elsewhere, Lucinda Williams brings the right amount of laconic yearning to ""Main Road,"" Pearl jam does a bang-up job of ""Crazy Mary"" and Michelle Shocked proves herself a top-flight gospel singer on ""Holy Spirit."" Those who find Willaims' material loopy, self-conscious and/or rambling will find nothing here to change their minds, but its all for a good cause, and there's plenty to enjoy."
3,"A victory for ""Victoria'.","This disc was released as a benefit for ""Victoria Williams"", but I feel like I've benefited from it myself as well. Her songs are all good, but the group of musicians covering them is even better. ""Pearl Jam"" probably got the most people to buy this, however I like the songs done by ""Soul Asylum"", ""Evan Dando"", ""Waterboys"", and ""Lucinda Williams"" just as much. ""The Jayhawks"" and ""Matthew Sweet"" do a good job too. Basically it's just a really good bunch of music. Also, there's currently 121 used copies on here for sale, so it shouldn't be too hard to come by."
4,Many songs on this CD are my absolute favorites,"I LOVE Lucinda Williams singing about ""Little redbud, off the main road, lucky little girl."" Don't know if I can exactly explain why. The melody and lyrics are fey, slightly off-kilter, but in a good way. Lucinda's voice is a perfect match with the tone of the song. Also I love the song about wild-eyed, crazy Mary. The lyrics are beautiful and perceptive, and the tune is so sad. The place associations (Louisiana) resonate with me in a specific way, since I lived in Lafayette and Baton Rouge for a short time and I have many enigmatic memories of that place. On the upside, there are 4-5 songs on this CD I cannot do without, but the rest I can take or let go."
5,Love this album,"I first bought this album when it was originally released because it had Pearl Jam on it and I was in love with the whole album actually. At the time, all that I knew was that it was a benefit album. However I now know what the benefit was for.. Ms. Williams was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and the benefit was to help pay her medical bills. In 1999 I was diagnosed with MS myself and this album has come to mean more to me. Knowing that Eddie Vedder's father also has MS just adds a little more something special to this album for me.If you like good music, buy this album."
5,a great CD for a great songwriter,"This CD is a great collection of Victoria Williams songs by excellent artists: Lucinda Williams, Soul Asylum, Eddie Vedder, and Maria McKee, with a little Adam Duritz and Victoria Williams herself pitching in on back-up. My personal favorite is Opelousas, a rocking version that makes you want to roll down the windows and sing along. Check it out of you're a fan of ecclectic artists and bands singing for a good cause."
2,SOUNDS OF THE SEASON,HATE TO SOUND NEGATIVE BUT SERIOUSLY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD....ABSTRACT MUSIC I MUST CALL IT. NOT ALOT OF PLEASING MEDLODYS AND A LITTLE BORING WITHOUT STRING OR OTHER INSTRUMENT ACCOMPANYMENT YAWN!!!
5,Excellent condition and service,This product came exactly how it was presented-quickly and in great condition-couldn't be happier!Thanks for the quick turn around-very pleased!
3,Chapter Four,"I have painted for three years, but never used colored pencilsbefore. So when I got to page 73 (the reason I bought the book) Iwas hoping to learn how to do the ""entire picture"" on page73......There were only 4 steps and nothing mentioning the curtain orthe window pane in the backround. Maybe it's just me, but I reallycould have used a few more steps and some graphics to go along withthe explanations.....I did love all the pictures used for the step-by-step demonstrations , but I think maybe there was just too much putinto one book and the demonstrations were a little short for abeginner like myself."
4,A great start,"There's no denying that Phil Hellmuth is full of himself, however... he is also a good poker player with a wealth of knowledge.This was a good book. I had read many others before, so the section on Holdem was difficult to sit through. I did learn a lot about Omaha Hi/Lo, Razz, 7-Card Stud, and Stud Hi/Lo. Those sections were a great start. The first time ever playing those games online... I was sitting there with the book open, reading it, needless to say, I made some money."
2,An interesting but dangerous book...,"I feel sorry for the poker novice that buys this book and sits in a low limit game using the ""theories"" presented here. The style of play illustrated is much too aggressive for the average player especially at a low-limit table where many players will stay to see the flop regardless of what they're holding. It does, however, contain some interesting stories about Phil's own exploits. If you want to learn more about Phil Hellmuth, this is a good book. If you want to learn to play poker, there are many better reads."
1,This book helps Hellmuth (not you) make money,"Hellmuth is certainly an accomplished tournament player. However, his tallent must truely be otherworldly to overcome his ego. The book deals almost exclusively with examples of how successful Hellmuth is, and is extremely light on the ""mechanics"" of improving play for the beginning or intermediate player. Likewise, advanced and expert players will find little of value here.Considering Hellmuth's well-documented ego and contempt for ""lesser"" players (watch/read about any major tournament in which he makes an early exit), the one redeeming quality about the book is that it reads like a talk straight from the horse's mouth--if there was a ghostwriter, he did an admirable job of capturing Hellmuth's hubris."
2,Play poker like the clueless,"The only reason why I rate this book 2 stars and not 1 is because by reading this book you will know how the clueless tight player -the one who has no idea about how to adjust its style depending of situations- play his hands. If you follow all the instructions given in this book regardless of the type of game you're playing in (tight, typical, loose) it will completely destroy your bankroll. Phil Hellmuth is a great player - no doubt about it. But what an awful teacher. I actually suspect him to have written this book just to confuse his opponents on the poker tour, and make a couple of bucks (sales) along the way. However if you like to read stories about a big mouth with a big ego who does nothing but brag about his good shots and never say a word about his bad sessions and bad decisions then, without the shadow of a doubt, this book is for you. Actually if you're a psychoanalyst you'll love this book because Phil Hellmuth is a nice... ""case""."
2,"Learn to play poker emotionally, not intelligently","Of all the books I have read on poker, this one has to be the one I disliked the most. While there are some good tips in the book, it is poorly written. The subject matter jumps around and Phil constantly refers to a sixth sense you are already supposed to have. I especially like the section on how to beat Internet people by watching their body language.Primarily this is a book about gambling by emotion, and not by measuring the odds or tactic. You might want to watch the World Series of Poker and look how losing situations are handled. (I've seen Mr. Heartmouth actually patronize a guy for winning and being happy about it.) Of course you will win several world series if all you do your entire life is play poker.Please try Brunson's book first. ;-)"
4,Great intro to NLH and PLH,"With this book, Phil gives the reader the knowledge to build a personal style. I have used his top-10 and top-15 hand strategy to good effect on single table tournaments. The book is well wrtiten, the best of the three I have purchased. The book does not cover mathematical threory, because it does not want to encourage the reader to chase hands. Maybe you will make money in the long run playing pot odds, but you may go broke first too."
4,Solid Starter with a Bio,"This is a very solid starter book for beginners. It goes through many situations and different types of players. Phil always has a good personal story to add in. With any book, the reader must be conscious of the author, Phil does have a bias in play, but he also has won the World Series of Poker. Not to mention countless tournaments. I always find myself going back to chapters to read up."
1,Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?,"Even first time players would be disappointed here. Summary of first part of book: AA, KK, AK are really good hands LOL.Summary of last part: Get a 'read' on your opponents if you can. A lot of that is just 'sense' and 'feel.' more LOL.Almost a complete bust... there was one really cool story about a hand he won ... and another really good one about a hand he lost.Phil simply ain't gonna give away his livelihood like some say super/system did to some extent for Brunson's 'easy' money.I agree with others here: at least teach us how to figure outs correctly for the price of the book. Jeeesh.""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?"""
2,Not Really ...,"While Phil Hellmuth has a spectacular tournament record and is doubtless one of the very best, this book is NOT going to make you either a good player or a winning player at a casino. It is simplistic, and the ""rules"" are far too simple to be applied. If interested in Hold'em, a much more useful book, thoughtful and detailed, is ""Middle Limit Holdem Poker by Ciaffone and Brier -- that's really the good stuff."
1,Not worth 5 dollars,"This is regarding the no limit part of the book: Considering Hellmuth is perhaps the greatest no limit player of all time, his discussion of no limit is lackluster at best. In fact, it is all but worthless but to the most inexperienced player (someone who has never played). Even for the inexperienced,however, there are much better books on the topic. I highly suggest buying super systems 2, whether you are a beginner or an experienced player. Super System 2 is well worth the money. Play Poker Like the Pros is hardly worth the paper upon which it was printed."
1,The least useful poker book I've read,"There is little new here, and anything Hellmuth has to say of any value has been said better before. Too much ""here's why I'm so good"" and not enough meat. There are many others I'd recommend instead; most if not all of them are recommended by others on this book's detail page."
1,Intsructions on getting killed!!!!!!,"The information in this book will get you killed in a real game. It is horrible advise for the low-limit player/game where almost nobody folds. Phil has been playing tournamtent poker for so long, he seems to have forgotten how to play a ring game. There are much better books out there."
1,Lacking,"I'll make this short. I've been playing poker for about nine years now and I know a good poker book when I see one. This is not one of those books. Phil probably wrote the book to market his ego and not his knowledge. He saw other greats defining themselves in the literature realm and decided he was going to do the same. His book lacks proper play with a lot of garbage telling you, ""dont play it this way unless your really good."" If I wanted that advice, I would have read a book written by dead money. I expected more, and got less. He rants about playing styles and how great his moves were in the past. Great Phil....good for you, Chan is still better than you."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This was the worst poker book I have ever seen (and I've read about 15 cover to cover). Phil may be a great poker player, but he has no place writing a book. His book offers no more poker strategy than what's written on the backside of a deck of cards. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
2,made me lose more,"this article is in reponse to the earlier article titled ""thanks phil, im making a killing!"". i bought this book hoping that it would help my poker skills, a valid reason. i read through the pages on no limit several times. as apbruce stated, play on the turn and river are hardly touched on. after reading apbruce's review, i realized that i was one of his ""phil's pheasants"", using phil's advice and losing consistently. i played much better using my own personal system. the book has more examples of great hands phil has won than fundamental strategy. the section on no limit was very disappointing."
3,Not for the Home poker player,"I was looking for some guidance on low stakes , saturday night with the boys type poker. This book is for the big-timewannabe poker players. Not enough game variety ! Too much Holdem strategy. More about bluff than skill."
2,Out of Date,"While this is a decent guide for beginners, it is way out of date for anyone else. Players are just so much better than they were when this book was written, and the system just won't do much good against good players. You just won't get any action if you play only 10 hands. But if you play against loose players or drunk players, this system is a good way to make money."
2,"The guy is a champ, not the book","I bought the book based on the author's reputation. It's similar to a book from the ""idiot's guide"" series. A lot of fluff and very little substance. Pages upon pages describe the types of players based on animal types -- in a caricaturistic cartoonist sort of way -- instead of going into the details of strategy and examining the odds. I found it very disappointing."
3,"Hellmuth is good, but his book could use a little work.","This book has some good advice for the absolute beginner. It also has some good advice for the okay player. If you know another game well, and want a quick introduction to a game you don't know, this book will probably be a good, easy, and quick way to do that. Other than that, be careful with this book. It doesn't offer too much ""bad"" advice, but the advice it does offer needs to be a little clearer before you can take it to heart. It does good to cover lots of games, and it does good by explaining how to handle different player types, but when it gets to advanced topics, it doesn't cover the advanced thinking well enough, which is necessary to really understand the advanced topics. This could really help the beginner, or the okay player, but if you already have read a bunch of books on the game you're looking for, look elsewhere."
3,"Great Stories, Weird Poker","This is the 10th or 11th book in my collection, but the first from a modern champ. Helmuth's anecdotes are awesome because of the violent, enormous swings in bankroll that he believes is normal at his level. The advice you will glean is, for the most part, solid but the Helmuth twist is the agresiveness. There are not a lot of players who will step up and, as he puts it, ""pound the pot,"" with the kinds of hands he likes to play without also having his player reading skills. Those skills are what no book can really help you with. This book is worth the price just for the tournament stories, the anecdotes on bad beats and his profiles of some of the world's top players. What do many of them have in common? Now and then they blow their brains out."
2,"Sometimes a decent read, but worthless","While this book is a decent read, it will not improve your play. I find it hard to recommend this to a player of any level, as his advices are dangerous and often plain wrong for beginners and useless for other players. This book barely touches math side of poker at all, offers nothing new and all the information is available in other books in bigger amounts and better presentation. There are far better books out there that i could actually recommend to people.Bottom line : by books by Sklansky instead."
2,"Misnamed, but not a total waste","I can't imagine any pro, let alone Hellmuth playing this way! This book is of marginal benefit to the complete neophyte, and useless to anyone above the beginner level. By stressing an extremely tight style of play, Hellmuth will keep you at the table while you learn the game. You will NOT earn any money, but you will not lose much either. There are many better books out there.His ""animal types"" are a bit silly, but help to explain playing styles to the new player. Al Schoonmaker's ""Psychology of Poker"" is a much better text for this topic.Read Jones' ""Winning Low-Limit Holdem"" if you've never played poker before, or Miller's ""Small Stakes Holdem"" if you have played before and want to take your game to the next level."
1,How he wants you to play,"One of the best poker players of all time but one of the worst poker books of all time. Written for player that are new to poker and it has no real depth of substance in its poker theory. Reading this book will help a novice to better understand the game but will leave you a long way from ""playing like a pro"".This is the way Phil wants you to play poker, so he beats you...."
1,Much better books are available,"Hellmuth is a fine player, but this book is not appropriate for advanced players and there are much better books for new players, i.e., Lee Jones, Winning Low Limit Hold'em."
1,A legend In His On Mind,"There is nothing new here in this book. Mostly play tight and raise often. Spends more time telling us about how great he is and less time giving any real insite into how to ""PLAY LIKE THE PROS"". He jumps back and forth too much and even forgets what situation he is refering to on occasions. In one part of his examples, Phil has you playing poker on the internet with a pair of jacks in the hole. His opponent, Jerry,checks. But, if Jerry does bet, then you must,""look for body language that might show confidence or fear"". How can I check for body language when I`m playing over the net? Phil spends too much time having you develop your instincts rather than giving sound poker advice. A waste of money!!"
1,Horrible,Do NOT buy this book. I made that mistake but you don't need to!This book doesn't really teach you anything significant. Phil talks about how much he has won and how good he is and shows you some animal pictures sitting at a internet poker table. Then on the next line he says that you should read the other players body language. Over the internet?! He doesn't even know what he's talking about.
1,Very disappointed,"I started playing poker about 6 months ago, and decided to buy this book to learn some new strategies. I am very disappointed with the book. Yes, Phil likes to compliment himself quite a bit, but that is not what bothers me about the book. I like to play No Limit Hold'em and Phil barely talks about this game in the book! It is the most popular game out there right now, and he mainly talks about Limit Hold'em.I mainly play tournament games, and he had a whole chapter on Limit Hold'em tournament strategy, but NO information on No Limit Hold'em tournament strategy! I feel like I just completely wasted my money."
1,"Very disappointing, Phil","I am a beginner/intermediate player, who sometimes challenges online poker and live league. It was my first book from amazon and regret to say - it is worth absolutely nothing. Author instead of giving clues is talking about how great he is.He advised to play only 10 hands - pairs from aces to sevens and AK and AQ. Without any logical explanation what to do next everyone can give such advices. Even I, myself can tell : ""folks play Aces and Kings, AK, AQ and be aggressive"".The book is in fact very bad, cannot be recommended for any beginner and i am sure professional players only laugh when they see this product. Reading stories about Hellmuth`s life you will never play like pro, only lose money."
2,"Lots of Feathers, but No Meat.","A book that is more about self promotion than about teaching, it is poorly written in many parts and has no continuity. There are many other MUCH more intelligent and informative books available. Skip this one as it can't possibly teach you what makes Phil Helmuth a great poker player, his ability to read his opponents.Clearly fold this one preflop."
