3,karate teacher,A fairly good book it answered my question was elvis a real martial artist and i believe he was. did i believe all the book well helo no. but its still a cool book if you are an elvis fan. i think elvis was a cool man looking for the tao maybe he was just looking in the wrong place.
2,Wouldn't do it again.,I think it was a little to small and dark. Pick on that is a littlemore happy and chain isn't good. I gave it to my sister.
1,Tiny.,Much smaller than expected. Chain is dainty.Not appropriate for a guy. A bigger medaland heftier chain is what I was looking for.
3,bit disappointing,"The information in this book is a bit generic and lacking in interesting factual information. I find the chapters disappointing when I read about a particular insect. The text is not particularly inspiring and does not capture the fascination of the insects' natural history. The topic is a fine one but it is handled much better by classic works like Fabre and Linsenmaier's ""Insects of the World"". We need to encourage writing on this topic by our best natural history authors and entomologists."
2,stand reveiew,"This stand looks pretty good if you don't mind drilling holes in your speakers and if you have heavy, hi-performence heavy speakers, you might want a different stand."
1,ar Description of Product,"I was unaware that this was to be downloaded to a device, and went back to read the other reviews. Evidently the download puts all the chapter Ones together, the Twos together -- and has to be manipulated to make sense. I was ordering for a blind friend and was disappointed in the product, and had to return it."
1,Does not work!,"My business parter and I spent a whole day and many T-shirts trying to trouble-shoot this product. Also, searched WWW to find help, but even website on package back had no information. Ink transfers very unevenly, even pulling off fabric in the process of peeling backing off. We never did get a good print of anything larger than 3 by 1-inch logo. Full size transfers too inferior to even consider, and we are professional artists!!"
4,Very Heartfelt and touching movie,"How do I describe this movie? Well, I'll try not to go overboard. The main character, Joesph, is certainly a man on a mission. He matured from before he came back. He admits he made mistakes and I think that shows character, so to speak. He came to terms with what he messed up and what needs to be fixed. Tabitha is a wounded soul that at first doesn't want to trust Joseph again because of the past. But then with the help of a saracastic friend learns what has to be done to make herself happy again. And Tina, you can tell, is very angry and feels betrayed by both Tabitha and Joseph. And I know this seems weird but I'm mentioning, Tina's boyfriend, Troy. He seems to really care for Tina and they're good together. In a nutshell-buy the movie. Watch it with everyone and anyone around you. It really does make you think about people's emotions, reactions, and feelings; including your own."
3,Great series but bad product,"My daughter loves the Full House series and the 3rd season is great however one of the DVDs will not play. I believe that it is blank as when we place it in the DVD player, it doesn't recognize the disc and we get the message ""No Disc"". Not sure if we can return it as it has been opened and other discs have been played. BEWARE!!"
3,Full House - The Complete Third Season,"This is a goofy but pleasant show; my stepson is in a retro-family TV phase and he ""needed"" this for his collection!"
1,*CHEAP LAUGH* Every 5 seconds!,"Full House is the corniest sitcom on earth. The people in the show say the corniest lines and then the studio audience is laughing like crazy. Sometimes they just laugh for something thats hardly even funny. The show a donkey moving his mouth and the audience is laughing like Mr. Bean made the funniest joke. But actually, if you have money to spend then get this horrible sitcom and laugh at what a sad attempt to be funny this ""Full House"" show makes. Also, I counted several times that ion 30 seconds, the audience laughs at least 3 times. That a minimum of 1 laugh every 10 seconds! Usually its 5 laughs every 30 seconds. Thats one laugh every 6 seconds!"
1,Should come with a bullet,"There is nothing that can be said about this show to reveal how awful it is. This show represents the beginning of a new era in television that falls into the ""unwatchable"" category. Full House is Small Wonder without the robot maid."
5,excuse me but can i say something?,"so people, does anyone who wrote a negative review allude to the fact that this show began in the LATE 80s- EARLY 90s? First of all, everything that was on tv, in the movies and written in songs during this time was completely corny! I think some people forget the age that this was written in and realize it was appropriate for then, and basically everyone who buys this is reminiscing on the fact that they used to watch and they once enjoyed it. There is NOTHING wrong with that! Fake laughter has been used for centuries, and if you can't appreciate the corniness go watch a modern tv sitcom and stay away from full house it never did anything to you.ok thats all."
1,Two of the Four DVD's don't work,This is horrible! I gave this to my kids for Christmas and two of the four disks don't work. Disk 3 doesn't play at all. Disk 4 skips thru every episode and Disk 2 skips at random intervals. The only disk that works is disk 1. I am so disappointed and will not buy from this seller again.
5,LOVE IT!,WE LOVE IT! We are going to buy the whole series. I enjoyed watching this show growing up and now my children are too. They love it and now we enjoy it together. Quality family show.We are watching tv shows of the days of yesterday and trying to stay away from tv shows of today.The only show today that is fun to watch is the family of Good Luck Charlie.
2,Not working out...,"All narratives are not written equally. This has been difficult to follow and somewhat frustrating to read. I also purchased ""Diary of a Slave Girl"" which I am breezing through and enjoy reading."
2,"Great book for the ""Greatest Generation""","Anyone who experenced the Great Depression, World War Ii or Korea will get a kick out of this book. Roy Sannella has definitely been there and done that. He came of age during the depression, seved in the navy and marines during World War II and korea, and lived the kind oflife many only wish they had lived. his tales of carousing with Harry Guardino, Tommy Sands, Frank Sinatra and the rat pack, his stories about the beautiful women he dates during the go-go Sixties, and een his grimmer stories about surviving hurricanes and typhoons make for great rading.This guy's book is worth reading!"
2,Amazon sold me a refurbished item instead of a new one.,"The item description said the batteries were new, yet the sealed plastic packaging was cut to allow extraction of batteries."
3,Good but not consistent mah,None of the Lenmars charged to 2700 mahs out of 16 batteries the range was 2200 to just over 2400 mahs. They do last a very long time in my devices compared to Eveready 2300 mah nimh. My charger is a Powerex mh-c9000 which I highly recommend If you want to get your batteries up to full capacity.
5,Good purchase!,"These batteries are 2700mAH, and provide the flash attachment I use with a long-lasting supply of energy. I use a trickle battery charger rather than a quick charger. Takes more time, but will not wear out the batteries as fast."
3,"Works, true capacity?","Works fine, however not sure it really has the advertised 2700 mah capacity. The charger I'm using indicates its capacity is substancially below the 2700mah. However I need several more charges to see if it builds up to the rated capacity."
3,Uniden,"The item was exactly as described. Very fast shipping, however they sent the wrong battery and when contacting the company they never replied. So what seemed like a great deal ended up costing me more to get a battery to make the phone work."
4,"decent product, good price",This product does exactly what it states: isolates your arm to focus the muscle contraction on your biceps.Its not magical but it is effective... I also found it works great with tricep exercises as well.
3,Arm Blaster,The Ironman arm blaster functions well. It holds my arms in place making curls a lot more effective. I felt the difference after one workout. It is inexpensive for a reason. The quality of the device is average. It has a cheap foam neck pad that slides on the strap. You also need to place the dangling end of the strap (where you adjust the length) through the neck pad to keep it out of the way. It could be a little longer and have a deeper body recess for added comfort. It doesn't bother me too much but larger people (more than 40 inch chest) would probably do better with a bigger version. Before you buy one try them out at your local sports store to see which one works/fits best.
5,Makes my sons happy-must be good!,We bought this and a different brand from a local sporting good store. One for each of my sons. The other one was cheap and flimsy (same price). This has nice padding and is very sturdy. I don't know anything about these...but this seems nicely built.
4,Does what it was built for,"This is a good Arm Blaster, it's not like the old heavy duty ones, but it is fine for doing the job it was intended, after all , equipment is as only as good as the one using it."
4,Purple pride!,"Ever since a certain troubled superstar left the Raptors en route to New Jersey, Jalen Rose is the best we've got. Rock this if you're a true Raptors fan. Would be nice if Amazon carried the home or alternate jerseys though..."
4,Make sure and use the grease,I used it the first time when I installed them but when I had to pull the springs again and I didn't grease them again and now they squeak like a mouse. I'm going to have to pull'em again in the spring and put more grease on them.Great otherwise.
5,"Ver, good quality, thick yet flexible cable","I needed an long power cable for a subwoofer, and I liked the flat-type power wall plug on this one (couldn't find it separate anywhere). I actually cut off the 'extension' connector and attached an IEC C13 RIGHT ANGLE POWER CORD CONNECTOR (also purchased on Amazon), to attach that to the sub. Love the cable. Very solid, thick and yet flexible. In my case, a perfect combination. Very happy."
3,80's Flashback,"Good memories brought back in one CD, but why stop here, you will probably be tempted to buy several others, but wait, there is a thing called the Internet and on it you can buy MP3's. What does this mean? Get all the hits you like for less greenback, what you will not get is the male chauvinist exploitation of the female anatomy in provocative positions, or is she just holding her head because she has a pounding headache from listing to too much Freestyle Explosion!In the words of Napoleon's older brother Kip, ""peace out!"""
5,Awesome!,"I love these shoes! I have always liked penny loafers for their classic look, and these completely fit. These are a good shoe, comfortable, and they arrived on time. The next time I need loafers, these are the ones I am going to purchase. :-)"
2,Disappointed,"I ordered these expecting a lovely shoe, sadly disappointed.The inside and the leather were inferior and looked cheap, there was no support at all inside unlike most loafers.The length was true but they turned out not to be very narrow ( I have narrow feet) I live in the UK and buy all my shoes from the US on line so not worth sending them back, just won't buy this make again."
3,Did not like rubber soles,The Eastland Loafers that I bought several years ago were better made and had a nice leather sole. The sole on the new shoe are some kind of rubber and I am constantly tripping or stubbing the front part of the shoe and have almost fallen several times. I do not live where it is slick or icy and would need the rubber sole. I will not buy these again as they are too dangerous.
3,Shoes run really large,"These are really well made shoes, but they run really large. I'm going to try a smaller size in the hope that going down one full size will lead to a shoe that fits."
5,Positive Feedback,"This classic shoe is bound to make a big comeback. It is easy to slip in to, comfortable to wear and goes with just about everything in the closet. Super buy! Will be adding more penny loafers to the wardrobe shortly."
3,Disappointing,"I had to return the shoes because the heel was too wide. The shoes were my normal size, 8M, and fit otherwise but I could not keep them."
1,TWO BLACK FOR NAVY,THE SHOE WAS A GOOD LEATHER GREAT FIT BUT THE COLOR WAS NOT NAVY IT LOOKED MOREBLACK THAN ANYTHING ELSE
2,Penny Loafers,I sent them back they did not run true to size. I wish I could find a pair some place that I could try on before I buy them. Bass Shoes in Phoenix Oregon went out of business.You would think J.C. Penneys would carry Penny Loafers! Anyone out there that knows where I can try them on and then buy them please let me know. tracybet@charter.net
4,Love these shoes!!!!!,"I have been shopping for more than a year for a simple, but classic style women's loafers, which I have been unable to find in brick & mortar stores, let alone in a wide width size. I have to admit that I was very hesitant to purchase shoes online, but after receiving these, I'm elated that I stepped outside my comfort zone. These shoes were extremely comfortable from the very moment I put them on and, more importantly, I haven't experience foot fatigue, even after wearing them all day long. I purchased a size 8.5W, although they feel more like a size 9W, so keep that in mind when ordering this style."
4,Fast and great selection,"My first order with SummitFashions. They ship really fast! I ordered on the 23rd, the package arrived the 25th. This set is very nice. Order it a bit bigger. If she normally has 32, I'd get a 34. The thong and bra come out a bit small."
5,Feel sexy,"I think this is a fun and sexy outfit to wear. The stockings are big enough for long legged girls like me. The mini skirt garter is very cute. The bra is easy to wear. I like how the material is see through gives a bit of a thrill covering up, but still gives peek. The whole outfit works for me."
4,Excellent service.,I am pleased with the item and the service. The stockings got a little use after the first wear or two and it felt pretty itchy at some points but other than that it's a great buy. Thanks! I will buy from you again.
1,DID NOT SHIP,Well it has now been 1 month and 4 days since i ordered this item and it has yet to arrive. all of my other orders arrived but this one didnt.
2,Jessica Bennet Slide,I found these sandels very hard to keep on my feet. I would walk right out of them. Perhaps it was the width.
3,"holds my hats, but a little cheap","When all is said and done (i.e., after an hour of assembly), I guess this thing does the job. It holds several hats. The app. 6 double-ended ""arms"" at the top are probably the most that you are going to find on such a rack. I guess it looks reasonably nice too.My main problems were that assembly takes a long time. (Two screws to attach each of the three bottom legs, three screws to attach the bottom *plastic* ring, app.6 screws to attach the upper arms, another app.6 to attached the top plastic ring, then screw three components together.) It's a bit of a chore. Also the wood is very lightweight. When I received the box in the mail, I could not believe the whole product was inside. The wood is just some kind of incredibly light particle wood product. It looks OK to the eye, just feels very cheap. It also means the entire stand is very light, which makes me wary about ever hanging coats on it."
5,Excellent examples of 'painting' with floral fabrics.,"Walking through Joanne's Fabrics, Gai Perry's book caught my eye. Having never tackled a quilt, I jumped right in and designed my first one based on my mother-in-laws beautiful English Garden at the shore. Using her easy to follow instructions, the wall hanging was a success. Now I'm quilting my interpretation of the Buchart Garden's on Vancover Island in B.C. On the drawing table is a moon light scene over a lake to be done exclussively in blues and purples.Buy this book, you'll be glad you did when you read about floral fabric selection, mixing and matching, gradations, and on and on. I've peeked at the photos in her 2nd book and can't wait to read it when Amazon ships it."
5,"I don't quilt, but I gift this book to non-quilters","This book is a gem. I originally stumbled across it in a bookstore when I was wracking my brain about what to get my mom, who has strong arts and crafts interests. I picked it up and started paging through it, and it was...beautiful.Previously, I had thought of quilting as the tiniest bit dopey: traditional patterns, ""country"" styles, very little in the way of innovation -- but this book completely turned me around. This is quilting as high art. Some of the quilts took my breath away. I almost kept the book for myself. I still might buy myself a copy.My mom had a more lukewarm reaction to it, along the lines that she probably wouldn't ever use any of the patterns...but I can imagine that the ideas in this book might influenced even her more traditional designs.Since then, I've given this book to both quilters and non-quilters. Anyone with an eye for beauty (especially if they love Monet) will love this book. It's a treasure. You would never guess."
2,Stale ink,"I've pretty much decided to fork over Staples' price for these ribbons. Can't seem to get any on Amazon that work worth a hoot. Maybe the turnover isn't enough to keep the ink fresh. Anyway, the print skipped so much that I requested a refund."
5,makes me happy,"buy this book if you want to be inspired and want to make this world a better , kinder, happier place to live in. great projects for personal growth and deepening relationships with others and yourself. you will be overwhelmed with the fact that you can't do all 52 at one time! I've bought this books for several people as gifts, too...everyone loves it! buy it, and share the joy!"
2,Just okay for a project book...,"I had bought ""Wreck This Journal"" first and sort of expected something similar...No dice! This was a dissapointment. While some ideas were good, others were nearly ridiculous! I would try to flip through before deciding to buy this one. Maybe it's just for non-creative types, because I'm always looking to start/finish a project and perhaps it's just not my style/speed. Buy it used! Great if you wanna plan something ahead of time for adults to do together!"
5,"Clever but sincere, this is a real gem","I read this book and was surprised by how much I liked it, given its simple premise. But its really rich, with thought provoking, sometimes quirky projects. Jeff's writing is engaging too, its not just some bullet point list. I even think I liked the opening chapters the best, where he writes about the joy and value of projects. Kind of gets your juices flowing.Its pretty smart and sophisticated, but the book has its heart in the right place. I actually liked it so much I bought one for xmas for my neice, I think she'll really like the book. It's a put together really well, and has a great look- it's a good gift I think. I'd recommend it for anyone."
5,52 Great Ideas With Something for Everyone,"Everyone can learn something, about themselves and their artistic impulses, from 52 Projects. I have never been able to draw and don't think of myself as particularly ""creative,"" but I found Yamaguchi's suggestions simple and inspiring enough that they had me thinking of projects I could work on, even simple ones. He offers enough detail to start you on the path but enough room for interpretation that people can take these projects and run with them, in whatever direction they like. Aspiring artists or people just looking for something to do on a rainy day will be well served by 52 Projects. I've given it as a gift to various friends and family members with very diverse interests and all have enjoyed it."
2,"Okay for beginners, but experts should look elsewhere","I loved the premise of this book: food and ""ambiance"" from the countries and locations along the Rhine, a river that stretches through several countries. But it doesn't deliver.The recipes are simple... a little *too* simple. When I was in the mood to make, say, a German saurbraten, I compared Nelson's recipe to several others. Her recipe wasn't bad, but it was wholly unremarkable. Every time I started to cook from this book, I ended up choosing a recipe from another cookbook.Nor does the ""travel"" information provide any insights. It's as if she scribbled a few notes from a guidebook, rather than give the reader a view into another place, another life.On the other hand, this book is suitable for people who are curious about European cooking but somewhat intimidated by ""authentic"" recipes. I ended up giving away the book to friends who are interested in German cooking, but not very adventurous."
2,somehow managed to skimp over the bits I was interested in,"Both this and his mentors books both skip to ""how to not spend any money to get average results"" of the tools I was interested in, yet go into extensive detail in other areas."
4,Cooper Wiring Socket Extension,"When replacing high wattage (100W.) lamps with the newer, equivalent low wattage spiral flourescent lamps, the width of the flouescent unit base will exceed the width capacity of the harp, in some lighting fixtures. This socket extension allows the lamp to fit in the harp by raising the thick portion of the lamp to a point where the harp has bowed out, and is wide enough to allow the lamp to be installed. It is not a fancy, high quality device, but it serves the purpose, and does not raise the lamp so high as to cause it to exceed the height capacity of the harp, in most cases."
5,Great soundtrack - A must have,"A good soundtrack gets you into the movie and makes you feel as if you are around as the story develops. A great soundtrack is the one that in addition to the above can be listened to in absence of the icon and still get you there. Jean-Claude Petit's Cyrano is one of these cases. Great music with many music themes, variations kept to a minimum and the film atmosphere all over the place. One of my favourite soundtracks, soon to become an all-time classic."
5,Don't leave home without it.,"Whether you're seeking solutions to personal problems, are interested in learning the ""nitty gritty"" about the nature of emotions, or are a professional in one of the many ""health & helping"" fields, this is a book that should be in a place of prominence in your library and one that is frequently reviewed. In ""The Secret Language of Feelings"" Banyan provides an easy to understand framework for a complex subject and follows up with specific methods for taking control of and improving your life. I'm sending copies of this one to friends and colleagues. Definitely a ""keeper""."
2,Nothing to interesting in this book,"I was so hoping this book would be so much more than what it was,Very dissappointing.I would not recommend this book for anyone to buy, it has nothing new to even offer"
4,Very Weird and Funny,"When I first saw the trailer to this film I had no idea what to expect. This is one of the weirdest but at the same time most creative Indy films I have seen in quite some time. Slow start and they try to do too much at the end but there are a lot of funny parts in between.To complain about the film's acting and obvious lack of budget would be unfair; anyone seeing the trailer is already well-aware of what they're in for. This film is slightly more accessible Troma piece, in that it goes way over the top in terms of gross-out effects in an attempt to shock the audience, including crude racial and toilet humor, not to mention gore.This movie clearly isn't for everyone but if you like ""Troma"" I recommended this film."
2,Just Okay...,"I purchased this along with my Samsung 42 inch DLP. Receiver will likey not fit on lower shelf. Biggest issue however is that it is a perfect fit for the TV, therefore, if you have surround sound...no room for front speakers on the stand. There is a cut out just below the midsection of the top shelf where the TV sits. You cannot put a center channel there. I do not know why they ate that much useable space. It looks cool, but get a stand with a full top level and large spacing between shelves below in case you have a big fat receiver and want it on the lowest level. You can also find something cheaper elsewhere. Resist the urge to buy this when you order your TV."
3,"Good stand, over priced","I almost bought this stand with the Samsung 42"" DLP but it's overpriced and shipping was overpriced as well. I'd recommend shopping around more to find the same stand 20 - 30 dollars off and cheaper shipping."
4,Awesome,"works great, i actually accidentally bought this model instead of the tv version to clear up ground looping we were having at a new apt. this model still worked and does the whole clean power thing and now we are not losing our minds looking at purple lines all over our tv."
5,Vintage Text book!,Great for your bookshelf! No one will ever read it and if they do they'll love the vintage text!
4,Pictorial book loaded with lots of info.,"This book touches on all areas that you will need to know about when cultivating and cooking your own herbs.Part I is called Herbs in the Garden and it includes 3 chapters. Chapter 1 - Planning anc cultivating a culinary herb garden; Chapter 2 - Growing Herbs in Containers and Window Boxes; Chapter 3 - Harvesting Herbs.Part II includes one large chapter (pgs 43 - 78) on growing and cooking with 32 delicious herbs. Each page contains a picture of the herb with it's common name, it's latin/scientific name, tips on growing the herb and culinary suggestions.Part III is called Herbs in the Kitchen. It includes over 40 recipes with full color pictures of the finished product,a glossary of terms, Herbal societies"
3,Its OK,"This record is OK. It certainly is very in your face and fun. The problem is most of these songs have been recorded by Sinatra somewhere else -- and they were recorded better. As a result, the CD doesn't really merit repeat listens."
4,"Fuelles motors,incredible!","The only idea of a fuelles motors make me buy this book. And it was a really interesting one, but lacks a more deep explanations. It is a must for Tesla fans"
3,Flashy but insubstantial,"This book is really all about the illustrations. It is a nice book to look at but it rather lacks substance in my view. I would say that if you reduced the size of the pictures a little and condensed the text, you could easily end up with a book of only 30 pages or so. The sashimi section contains quite a few entries but, while it covers a bit of basic knife technique, it is fairly perfunctory and hardly comprehensive. The sushi section does provide step by step pictures but I suspect that novices will have a hard time if they try to use this book as a guide. I would instead recommendSushi Cookbookfrom the Quick and Easy series."
3,Not for Beginners,"Takahasi's cookbook is great, tasty, and the food is to die for. If you've the means, that is. The sad thing about this cookbook is that there's alot of tasty stuff, and all the ingredients are hard to come by. Plus, if you've never made sushi before, you're in for a wild ride.I only wish it came with a bamboo roll mat. My kitchen would be much cleaner that way."
4,nice job boys,"This album is reminiscent of Pavement but not so much as to be distracting...plus its far better than anything since Wowee Zowee, because it ain't tryin' too hard. It has a surface, simple country-jangle flair at first listening but its really quite dense with background noise and road angst. You never get the feeling that they're trying to be better than the genre they're either immitating (or whatever it is they're doing)...the irony is way way way in the back, where it belongs, and earnestness at the forefront. I bought the CD for the song Smith and Jones Forever (that song alone is worth the bucks) but there are other nice tunes to sing along and scratch your head to. Wow, this is a good album. I'm giving this 4 stars because 5 seems like it should be reserved for once in a great while kind of--like Exile on Main Street, or the Chronic."
2,Cashing the slacking,"You could do worse if slacker rock is your thing, but eerily evoking a third-rate imitation of what you do better elsewhere for the sake of your (even more wearily witty) buddies shouldn't necessarily warrant investment, and augmented by a crummy second half here, it doesn't."
2,Rampant grade inflation... for bad singing...,"I'm looking at the effusive reviews for this Silver Jews record and they just underscore how unreliable Amazon customer reviews are. Five stars for this album? Ridiculous. The lead ""singer"" (is it D.C. Berman?) has a determinedly bad voice....I kind of admire his fearlessness, singing in public despite such a glaring lack of talent. And a couple of the tunes are not completely unbearable thanks to decent guitar playing, but I think 2 stars for this CD is more than generous.If you like music that's raw and offhanded and on the improvisational side I strongly recommend checking out Akron/Family. Akron/Family are far better musically than Silver Jews but are not completely dissimilar."
4,"Quirky, Understated, Laid Back Folk-Rock","This is an odd and highly entertaining amalgam of Lou Reed vocals, twisted lyrics, and laid-back song structures that are married to country-rock and modern rock arrangements, and somehow what comes out of it all is a very relaxed, enjoyable record. I think if you go into this not expecting to be overwhelmed, you will find yourselves pleasantly surprised.It's clear that all the significant talent that came together to make this cd really enjoy singing and playing with each other. The results are fresh, unique, and at times, memorable. Put this on one Sunday morning, open up the newspaper and sip your coffee, and enjoy."
3,Give it a break!,"Hey guys, give this poor little flick a break! In the first place, if you are a Russell Crowe fan, I think you'll just like watching him because, darlings, he's at least half of what's on the screen at a given time. Yes, many of the criticisms in the other reviews are valid, but my husband and I...married 38 years this summer...saw ourselves all through the movie. (He cried at the ending.)I think anyone who's been in any kind of long-term relationship could get something from it. Okay, the ""talking to the screen"" bits are annoying. I felt the ""man-on-the-street"" interviews were relaxed but went on a bit too long, yadda, yadda, yadda. This will not be on anybody's list of top 5 or even top 100 ever, but any movie where Russell Crowe licks someone's toes has to be worth a look-see and given a little slack!"
3,Breaking Up,"This film made me laugh, sigh, cringe and downright squirm as I watched it. It brought back way-too-vivid memories of the two great passions and subsequent breakups of my own life. The bathtub scene absolutely cracked me up, seeing what goes through a guy's head while he's acting all tough and ""over it""- the camera angles are priceless.While it may be uncomfortable to watch at times, this movie does a good job of telling its story in a way that will ring true with a lot of people. The characters are well played, not always likeable, but familiar in their actions. It left me with a sad ache, a small sense of relief, and maybe a bit of hope . . . ."
3,Attractive stars and realistic story make this worthwhile,"I saw this movie as a Russell Crowe fan and found it to be quite realistic in depicting the ups and downs of a sexually charged relationship. Sometimes the characters' quarreling gets to be too much, but the end results are worth seeing."
4,Breaking Up (video with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek),"Just watched the movie ""Breaking Up."" Editing not the best. Watched the alternative/deleted scenes and felt one of the scenes should have been included in the movie to improve clarity. Highly recommended movie for Russell fans; he's adorable and very talented."
2,Not goo enough to buy,"I really like Russell Crowe and Salma Heyek in this movie, but it was just too boring to buy. I definately thought the ending was the best part though.........because the movie was over. If I could I woudl SO ask for my money back. Although the movies offers some steamy hallucenations, it's not worth the time and effort to watch movie. Trust me, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!... Rent it from blockbuster or something....."
4,5th Review! Why I taped this movie,"I taped this movie for 1 reason: Russell Crowe. Not only can he act, he's gorgeous & he's my age. The film was a waste of his talents, that co-star will not have a career in her later years when all she does is use her body instead of acting ability."
3,Breaking Up/Not Bad,"Russell looked great, different kind of movie, just the two characters, but I thought the premise was good, Different kind of role for him, never pictured him in a romantic comedy..but I think he could swing any kind of role..."
2,Hard to get into,"The characters simply got on my nerves. I so wanted to reach out and shake some sense into both, demanding they grow up. There's only one scene where I felt the characters became real, and that's when they decide to get married and as a lark are interviewing people on the street about love/marriage/relationships. It's as if the actors finally relax and are being themselves. Otherwise, turn down the sound and simply enjoy looking at two beautiful people. Make up your own dialogue. It'll probably be more interesting than what's actually being said."
4,BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO,"THE FIRST TIME I VIEWED THIS VIDEO, I WASN'T TOO IMPRESSED. BUT, AS I'VE NOW WATCHED MONICA AND STEVE GO THROUGH THEIR LOVING AND BREAKING UP PERIOD SO MANY TIMES, I HAVE BECOME ADDICTED TO THE VIDEO. ADDICTED BECAUSE I WANTED THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO WORK....SHE IS WARM AND SENSITIVE TO THE WORLD....HE IS SO CONSERVATIVE THAT HE PHOTOGRAPHS DEAD FRUIT...THEY WOULD HAVE HAD BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN TOGETHER AND WORKED OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES LIKE MANY MARRIED COUPLES....I ALSO LIKED THE SURREAL PARTS OF THE MOVIE...."
3,Gets a bit better as it moves along,"The writing could have been much better for this story of a man and woman who cannot seem to stay apart or stay together for very long either way, although it does improve somewhat around the middle of the story--if you can stick with it for that long."
4,Romantic film,"Breaking up.Russell crowe was great in this movie, hot headed but romantic,DVD was in good order, nice and clear."
2,ICK!!!!,"This movie was just awful. It was an attempt at an artsy kind of film, almost with an independent look, but it didn't even cut it as that. Aside from that, they just kept separating and getting back together too often and too quickly to be funny; it was only annoying. I like Russ Crowe, he was superb in LA CONFIDENTIAL, and even good in THE QUICK AND THE DEAD, but this movie just didn't make sense at all. To close, don't buy this movie; rent it, and only if you MUST see it."
2,For Russell Crowe fans,"Honestly, I watched this movie for Russell Crowe. If that's why you're here, rent the movie and watch the first ten minutes. After he's finished licking Salma Hayek's toes, hit rewind, then play. Repeat a dozen times, then return the movie. The story is sour and depressing, and follows a doomed relationship. There are enough doomed relationships in the real world that I can't find a fictional one entertaining. On the plus side, Russell does a nice subtle New York accent."
2,Continuing the film spree,"This is, in my opinion, the next weakest of Mr. Crowe's films that I've seen. The bottom film is ""No Way Back"".The problems, I see, with this film come from direction and lack of trust. Which could come from not trusting the director or the actors not having any time to form a connection. Since film is shot out of sequence there is an imbalance with the levels of acting on the screen. Scenes where the characters/actors are starting to finally connect and trust each other and give over to the moment are interspersed with scenes where there is no trust and it has nothing to do with the timeline of their relationship.Continuity, with the accent? Yes, it appears to be New York but at one point the conversation is about him and Australia? Onward and upward"
2,Salma gives good body,"A pleasant film if you like to ogle Salma Hayek's bod. Otherwise, it's a not-so-intersting story about break-ups. The best part is when Russel Crowe licks Salma's toes right in the beginning. It's all down hill from there."
3,delivered as promised,The book delivered what it promised. What I found neat about it is that it needn't be solely for high-powered characters. Even a lowly 5th level batd or rogue makes for a playable courtier. Just be sure to have several books at hand already- DMG2 for setting up a mercantile empire and Heroes of Valor to play a general are two necessities. Wish I'd known that before I the book.
2,power...,not update info on the epic characters ofthe realmscould have used some more umph like epic spells and the like
3,An interesting sourcebook for high level play in the realms,"Very short review time. This book has NO CRUNCH. no prestige classes, no feats, no new spells. It does, however, have a lot of interesting information and tips on how to conduct an epic-level game in the land of Faerun.Not to say that the book isn't fascinating, but its about 8 light years away from what I've come to expect from Forgotten Realms supplements. Know what you're buying, and if you think this sort of thing might interest you then give it a whirl. I can't give it more than faint praise overall though."
1,Terrible compilation,"This is a terrible compilation. Almost none of the songs are the original hit versions, & the versions included of most songs are extremely disappointing renditions of great songs. The fine print on the cover states ""this compilation contains original recordings as well as new recordings by the original artists"" - I wish I had read this before I bought it. Stay away from this compilation, unless you like vapid renditions."
2,Hat Rack Stand,"This product has too many parts and some were missing. Also, within 2 days of assembling the product broke into."
2,Predictable comedies,"I don't find George Bernard Shaw as entertaining as I'm supposed to. I have no doubt that his work was very forward-thinking and funny at the time, and I know that he is an important playwright. I'm also sure that in the hands of the right director any of these plays would be fantastic. However, I felt like all of the stories in this collection contained the same gimmicks. You could tell where the play was going in the first couple scenes. I guess my favorite of them all was Candida. It had the most unexpected plotline, and I felt like it wasn't trying to be anything."
1,Not so happy.,"Too large for my wife. The only way probably is to go to a watch repair guy. Lesson learned, not to buy anything from amazon things that is needing adjustment. I'm thinking returning but I'm not sure if the company will still accept it."
4,Downloading from the Net (Essential Computers),This tiny book is concise and straightforward. If you want to save time and have only 1 hour to read. This is for you.
4,buy it,"This is a great collection of obscure Django songs. A lot of it with vocalists and larger bands. There is even an early track of him playing banjo. Not what you would typically hear on a Django album, but I would recommend it to anyone who really likes Django Reinhardt."
4,Django Before the Hot Club...,"Indispensible to get an idea of Django's development before he was totally infused by jazz. Caberet music, Django on guitar banjo! Perhaps it was the banjo that gave Django much of his musical line in later performances."
5,Flame Of Recca Rocks!,This Manga really rocks! I don't know about the english version as i am reading the chinese version of it! But it is still a very enjoyable and full of action comic book! I really reconmend to people who like reading comics!
5,great,The book was in the exact condition thaat the owner had said it was in. I would recommend buyer again.
2,Burned Out After One Year of Use,"I bought this Power Center at Amazon last year at this time. Last weekend it just stopped working. There was no surge and no storm, but suddenly everything that was connected to it turned off. When we went to check on it, it was very hot, and would not reset or turn on again. It worked fine for the year that we had it, but for the price, I expected it to last longer. The HD Plasma TV works just as well and the power is just as ""clean"" with the Belkin PureAV PF30L Home Theater Power Conditioner that I bought at Sam's Club for $29.86. Not that it matters too much, but the Belkin is much more attractive too."
2,"It works, I guess.","Replaced my ancient surge protector with this power strip that acts not only as a surge protector, but power conditioner. Does it really work? I have no idea. My municipal utility has always delivered high quality power, so I have no idea if the power conditioning is adding any value. Just a leap of faith on my part. I can't notice any difference in my picture quality. I figure it can't hurt and can only help.I do like the ergonomic features. Certainly color coding and labeling of which plug is for what piece of equipment is great! No more searching for the right plug. I also like the fact that they provided 2 widely spaced plugs so wall-warts can fit. Those design features are certainly worth a premium over your average power strip.UPDATE: 2 years after purchasing, the thing completely died on me."
5,Great Product,I would say that this surge protector is high quality. It comes with monster coax cable and a heavy duty phone cord. It has colorfull conectors that are labled with the device that you plug into it for easy unpluging.
5,Perfect Dwsign,Very well made unit and I am a big critic of product designs.The only thing that could make it better is to motorize it....LOL.It may even be heavier than my TV!The price can not be beat.Product was delivered before the expected date.
4,Solid Surge protector,"This is a very well made surge protector. I'm not a fan of the Monster Cable company due to their overblown pricing, but I do put my trust into a few of their products. Although I have yet to really see the benefits of it's surge protection (I'm sure it's been doing so, but of course I don't notice it), what I did notice is it's ability to clean the power going through. I have several TVs in my house and when I run the vacuum cleaner you do see some noise getting to the picture except for the one hooked up to the PowerCenter. While Monster's speaker wire price/quality ratio isn't worth it to me, their power products I do see the value in."
3,Surge Protection and Power Noise Reduction,"Surge protection is not the only issue one need consider with respect to television, stereo, or computer hardware. AC power noise is another aspect to consider in order to maximize the quality and life of your investments. I found the Monster Cable PowerCenter a fine small investment for surge protection while also allowing a modest improvement in TV picture quality.UPDATE A YEAR+ LATER: The surge protector flat out went dead. No signs of power surge as others in the area were present and did not suddenly die. Overall, as typical with Monster products, overpriced and apparently not one that is long lasting."
2,It is what it is,"I guess for $50, this is an ok product. I am usually very against monster products, but I'd seen this for almost double at big box retailers, needed a surge protector for my new DLP tv, so figured what the heck. It arrived without incident, I hooked it up and so far so good. It basically a power strip with labels that also happens to be purple... for the ""neato"" effect I guess. Anyways, no idea if its worth more than your run of the mill surge protector. But the claims of independent circuitry to minimize cross-interference is what I was really interested in, as I have my reciever, cable box, DVD player, and subwoofer all connected... All in all a good buy I guess, at least you paid a lot less than retail... :)"
5,Monster Cable MP HTS800 HP Surge Protector,"I have a 36 inch Sony Wega TV, Pioneer DVC302D DVD player, SONY VCR and a code less phone on the Monster Cable MP HTS800 HP Surge Protector. Observed a slight improvement in picture quality after installing the HTS800.Really liked the color-coded AC outlets with matching labels. Also the extra space between power outlets so that power adapters for telephone etc can be connected easily.I recommend this product for your home theater."
3,Surge Protector ?,"I already had a ""regular"" surge protector before I bought an HDTV but I live in an area with frequent electrical storms ... so I thought that this device would keep me from having to unplug it every time it storms. Quoted from the instructions: Warning-Storm Precautions. In the event of a lightning storm, immediately disconnect your Monster PowerCenter from its power source. :( Just thought other buyers would like to know."
5,Satisfied in it's simplicity!,"Monster Cable products have always proved to me to be quality. this surge protector shows me the exact same traits. This comes with 8 plugs and of which 3 can easily fit any large ac adaptor. This has protected my computer from several electrical storms. My cpu is also plugged into a cable jack through my cable modem and this mc surge protector also has a jack for that. not only that but my phone is also plugged into it so i can always have a safe phone to talk on. The warranty that comes with it is also and excellent deal. if something happens to anything while plugged into this surge protector, it will be replaced up to 50000 dollars."
4,Faint high-pitched tone,"I'm using the Monster Cable MP Home Theater PowerCenter HTS800 to remove line noise in the electrical current to a high-end tube pre-amp. The line noise is removed beautifully; however, the PowerCenter itself creates a high-pitched tone. The tone comes out of the PowerCenter device directly. If you are planning to use this product on a high-end sound system, I recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated."
4,Budget audiophile tweak,"I'm an audio guy first, so I can tell you first hand, yes, this has improved the imaging and dynamics of my system. For video applications, colors are more vivid, pictures sharper, and even cable TV looks better.This is [money] well spent. Give it a week to break in, and you'll really start to notice how much you're enjoying music and watching movies, with this hooked into yer system."
1,Dead on Arrival - don't know why,"This product came in a timely fashion, in perfect packaging and looked brand new. However, it simply does not work. The POWER light is on, the Ground light is On and the Protection Enabled light is on, however only half of the surge protector has power (the half with only 2 outlets!). No matter what I do, where I plug it in, or how many times I reset it, the second half of the surge protector does not power anything.I'm sure this product has potential, but mine did not function as expected.I'm in the process of returning it for a refund.-Ryan"
2,Blew up - No apparent reason,"For no apparent reason, this thing died the other night. No storms, power failure. Nothing else in the house died. No other circuits or surge supressors blew.Switch doesn't work. Back behind the switch is slightly melted. Smells of electrical fire. I'm gonna try to call support and see about warranty."
4,Guess it's fine - as long as it protects my system,"Can't tell any difference as far as a cleaner signal, but as long as my system is protected from surge that's all that really matters to me. I do wonder though if this really makes a difference over a regular surge protector at a fraction of the price.No complaints, but also no noticeable signal improvement or cleaning."
4,Never a lack of drama,"This third installment in the Beaumont series again, well written and wonderfully detailed.Surprisingly, J.P is not on a fast track to almost loose his job before getting to solve the crime as he usually does. He has a tendancy to burn quite a few bridges before getting ahead in solving the puzzle. The book leads you into many different conclusions before finally revealing the truth. Every twist and turn makes it impossible to put the book down.Jance has a talent for extracting emotion while reading her novels."
4,a great read,"in the spirit of ""dealers of lightning"", 3 degrees above zero tours a large corporate research laboratory with skill and clarity. by focusing on achievements and people, it navigates the large labs and really highlights interesting topics.i'm a geek, but no engineer. however, i really found the writing to be clean and move along at a good pace. by talking to people who what got them into research, how they got to their topics, and why they do what they do, it's a fascinating look at a bright collection of minds and people.written at the time that the labs were about to be spun off, everyone ends a chapter with comments on what they think will happen next. definitely interesting given the historical perspective you can now apply.hunt this one down, i think you'll be pleased."
3,undersized,Not quite a full 6.5 in probably a 6.2. Had to re-drill and shim to fit. What a pain. Have not tested yet. Heavy magnet structure.
3,Replacement for stock Jeep Sub,"The Pyramid sub is an ok replacement for a blown Jeep sub, but is far from great. The Pyramid sub is just one of those ""you get what you pay for"" items. It works and provides a touch more bass than just listening to the 5 1/4 sound bar & dash speakers. Just not as much as I expected and not as much bass as the stock sub did before it blew. The Kicker 6.5"" sub would be better & that's what I'll be doing if/when this Pyramid one goes out on me."
5,Great sound for the price.,"I was weary of the Pyramid name, especially at this price, but I read the reviews and figured ""what's $30?"" I'm glad I ordered. While these won't rattle the fillings out of your teeth, they provide good, mid bass with very little/no distortion. I wanted some bass, but I honestly feel that I've grown past the point of a handful of amps and caps and I like the cargo space in my SUV so these were just what I was looking for, I'm actually considering a second pair for my car."
2,its fine :/,it shipped fast but the only thing i did not like was that it said it would fit my car and it did not so i had to move my other speakers around to put them in the back it took about 2 hours to finish everything..i thought it was 2 speaker but hey for $7 its fine. im going to have to get another one soon bc 3 speakers is not loud enough for me..cant wait to really try them out
3,Budget PC Tool Set,"Not bad for $7 or so ,lol.....Seemingly worked to unscrew an phillips head screw on my new Compaq to install another 2 Gig's of RAM ,lol....."
4,Not for MacBook Pro,"I bought this to upgrade the RAM on my MacBook Pro, it really is a great kit but doesn't have the tiny screwdriver you need to get to the RAM. Luckily I had a watch repair kit around that did the trick.Works great on my G5 tower though!"
3,A new name for the Belkin electronics toolkit,"Only about half the tools in the kit are actually useful; however, those tools seem to be well made. It would be nice if there were more useful tools specific to electronics included in the kit."
2,Cost and quality is not Proportional,The Quality is not that awesome when compared to the cost of this Product. I Bought this to repair my Laptop and it really was not compatible with my SONY laptop. I hardly opened one or two screws using this Kit. Not user friendly either.
4,"Cheap, utilitarian, basic kit.","This is a cheap and utilitarian basic tool kit. It has just what you need for working on your hardware and nothing more. A couple philips and a couple flat-heads with a nice little parts retrieving tool. If you just need an extra kit around, it's worth it. No frills and not something you'll want to use for heavy duty jobs, but if you're putting a computer together, go for it. You can buy more expensive ""computer tool kits"", but they tend to mostly come with a lot of additional pieces that you'll never use, like a ""memory chip remover/setter"". When was the last time anyone needed that?!"
4,Convenient. Compact. Comprehensive.,"This is a nice little tool set. It may be just a tad bit pricey for the quality of tools, but it's great to have handy. I keep it in my office because I frequently have to take computers apart. This tool set has everything I would need and more. But basically I just use the Phillips screwdriver all the time.As seen in the pic, you get 2 Phillips drivers of different sizes, 2 flat head, 2 hex head (great for tightening the hex nuts on a VGA or DVI port etc.), a chip remover (never will use this one), a torx driver, tweezers and cool little grabbers for screws lost in tight spots.As I said earlier, the quality is not something that would warrant use of this tool set beyond typical in a computer environment. They certainly would stand to up to even normal use with a carpenter or mechanic or anything like that. There's no doubt this was made in China for less than a dollar. But if you're looking for a compact tool set to keep handy, consider this one."
2,Not OEM Replacement,"This is a poorly made Taiwanese auto part. The plug must be removed for installation and then the pins fall off due to poor clamping. The wires are shorter than the original making the connection under the dash that more difficult. The cancellation tabs are poorly molded and left with excess plastic on the ends so the action is harsh unless they are trimmed or they are left to wear smooth over time. I had to use this part in a pinch but I will be replacing it again with another brand (Airtex Wells is much better). And, the emergency flasher switch did not work."
4,good with lots of plugs arranged intelligently,"Kind of hard to test if this protects from surges. No thunderstorms, power outages, arc-welders in the immediate neighborhood since I bought this. And I'm still the ""chicken"" type that unplugs when I hear thunder. This unit will hopefully protect from ""surprise"" surges and little ""baby"" surges. The colored sockets are handy if one has colored cords with colored plugs - unfortunately, mine are all black so this ""feature"" is not useful. Yes, I'd recommend this to family & friends."
5,Works as advertised!,Great power strip! The cord is the best part. The flush mount design allowed me to have my desk right up on the wall. The cord spacing allowed me to have a variety of plugs in one strip instead of having to space it out as I have done before.
5,It Has A Phone Jack Sujo,I own this powercenter. It's great and performs better than my &quot;Tripp&quot; IT HAS A PHONE JACK. I don't know why Target would publish a review from someone who obviously can't figure out which model he/she bought. Unfortunately for Monster ... they did. A happy Monster purchaser and convert who has experienced the &quot;Monster Difference&quot;.
3,Nix for two-pronged plugs,"This surge protector accepts only three-pronged plugs. That's fine for a TV set, but DVD players come with two-pronged plugs and have to be plugged into other outlets, defeating half the purpose of this purchase. I am disappointed. There ought to be a better way."
1,NOT 220v Surge Protection,I buyed this Surge Protection and i live in a country with 220vThis product DONT SUPPORT 220v what a shame !!! at least put that info in the Product details OR SOME WHERE !!! 40$ in shipping on the trash !!!
4,good buy,"I have had it a month and haven't had a problem yet! The only complaint I have is the sockets are really tight and I had to practically jam in my Dvr plug into the socket. Otherwise, everything works great."
4,"Very Pleased, very easy directions, simple install.","Excellent Purchase, Simple and very effective. Erie PA had a very bad wind storm this week. Power on and off every 5 seconds about 20 times in 1 hour. This product did not fail whatever. All high end equipment plugged in. After that first hour though i felt i shouldn't press my luck or any products endurance. So I unplugged everything from wall outlet to be safe. Thank you, this product is just what i wanted."
4,"so far, so good","I bought this to protect my Marantz home theater, PlayStation 3, and Samsung flatscreen.Outlets are well spaced and this device protects my incoming cable service also. So, if I suffer a lightning strike, will it work? Stay tuned..."
1,Not What I Spected,"First and last time buyer, during last Friday's thunderstorm had a power surge and didn't protect anything connected to it. The HD receiver cable box is burned and so it's my ""New"" LED TV. The cable company can replaced the receiver box but.... my LED TV?"
2,Not worth it's cost,"I admit,this is a nice ""looking"" power strip and it will work just fine with your electronics equipment,but you can get the same quality in a surge power strip for half the price of this one.With Monster Cable products,it seems that 50% of the product's price is in the way it ""looks"",not what it actually ""does""."
1,No phone jacks,"The description of the products says ""Protects coaxial and phone lines used with DBS equipment from surge pulses."" It doesn't define ""DBS equipment"" and there are no phone jacks -- making it impossible for me to use it as a protection for phone lines."
5,Monster cable power center,"This product exactly what it is suppose to do. Arrived in perfect condition. It even came with a HDMI cable, what a plus"
5,I would recommend,"this is well done and materials and components are of good quality ... simple, functional and above all cheap ... I would recommend ..."
5,A perfect power center,"This is very compact, visually attractive, and simple to use. Everything is labelled and it does not even feel warm when every outlet is used. The cord is thick (actually a bit stiff) for better protection and there is more than enough outlets. Great price for a great product."
1,Way over priced!,"This is the most overpriced item, I own several Monster power items, and their higher end units are great but this thing is worthless, you might as well get a no name brand.I had this thing one my 3rd TV and it fried out within 2 weeks, and none of the others did."
5,Its a Monster.,"This thing is huge, it really is a Monster. But it works great. I have every confidence that I am getting clean reliable power and surge protection. As well as great cable length. It's easy to identify products by the included color labels and logos on the device, and offers superior cable management options. All around a great product."
5,Great Surge Protection,I bought this surge protector following a storm that seemed to mess up my last protector. The Monster Cable protector works just fine and hase plenty of room for all of my PC and office plugs. The extra wide sockets come in very handy too.
3,Works okay; don't use the coax cable connector,"When I first hooked up my new HDTV and DVR, I couldn't get a signal to the DVR. When the cable guy came out, he said the problem was a weak signal. After working on my cable for 30 minutes, it turns out that the ""surge protection"" of the cable coax on this unit loses too much of the signal. Don't use it.Otherwise, this product is fine...but I could have bought a cheaper one that didn't have these ""extra"" features."
5,Monster cable surge protector,"Just the surge protector I needed, comes color coded so you can easyly find what's hooked up to that plug!! Great!"
2,Nothing happened and it smelt burnt,"Noticed something smelt burnt, no power surge or anything. Kind of disappointed with it. Didn't last long at all. Got a Belkin now. So far no issues."
4,Monster Cable,Not much to say other then it works as stated. No more worries about our TV blowing up during a power outage which has happen to us before.
1,Item was defective,"The item arrived in packaging looking like it had been opened prior and had been returned. Plugged it in and got a constant hum and the reset button didn't work. No power to the unit at all. The seller accepted the item as a return, no problem. I didn't have to pay for the return shipping and my entire order, including original shipping charge, was refunded, so I was pleased with that, at least. I've learned that buying electronics over the internet can sometimes be tricky, but with Amazon I have NEVER had a problem with any return."
2,Works great - but only for 3 years,"I've used this product without problems for almost 3 years. Then suddenly last night, for no good reason at all, the power running my entertainment system blinked off. It actually cycled a few times before completely powering down. I had a few things running at the time, but nothing more than I typically have sucking power. I looked behind my entertainment center and noticed the power switch light was still on. I reached to power off the switch and it gave no resistance, just a limp piece of plastic - no switch sound at all!?After some troubleshooting, checking circuit breakers and other power strips, I found the culprit to be this Monster power strip. I read some other reviews here on Amazon about this product. Most are good, but one reviewer had a very similar problem to mine - it quit, without notice, after 3 years. It could just be coincidence, but this makes me a little suspicious. Has this happened to anyone else?"
2,Clip is useless,"The clip is useless. If you have it on your belt and move at all the phone will fall, case and all."
5,The Standard Chemistry Textbook!,I used this book as a supplement for Ege's organic book. It helped me do well in my class and prepared me for the chemistry GRE. This book is older but well worth the cost. I think it should be on any chemists' shelf of literature. The reactions it tells you are easy to understand and the mechanisms make sense. The only problem I would have is the spec. section for infared is a little weak. But it does everything else well so it makes up for it. Buy this Book for undergraduate study you won't be disappointed!
2,Great When it Work - (Infrequently),"I have the IQue3600, in fact I've had 5 of them. When its working, its absolutely amazing. The PROBLEM in a nutshell, is that its fragile. None of mine has worked for more than a 2 week period. The wiring that passes through the antenna hinge breaks, and you then can't access satelites at all. Up to now, they've been good about replacing. Now they won't even answer my email, and its over 30 minutes on hold to talk to someone, so I'm guessing they're having lots of problems. I'd wait until they get the bugs out before buying one of these, but when they do, its super."
1,Don't buy this product!!!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it has been nothing but problems! First, we were online with the Garmin support system for over 2 hours (1 hour on hold) to figure out why it wouldn't connect to our brand new computer. Finally we got it to work. Then, we tried to Hot Sync and got a Fatal Error that isn't going away. I have spent 45 minutes on hold with their Customer Service and I am still waiting. I am sure it would be great if it worked but it has been a complete and total waste of money. I will NEVER buy a Garmin product again!!"
1,Overly complex!! A pain in the axx to use!,"Without clear instruction, a product isn't worth a dime.The unit is premature for release and confusing.The only use for the insturctin book is as toilet paper. Perhaps it was written by Chineese.If you have nothing to do, but run around in circles, shell out $ 600! If you plan to use it without a career in guessing how to make it work, get something else."
4,We call her Miranda,"This is my second Garmin PDA. Both have been great.The screen is large and easy to read, even daytime in the car. The mapping and directions have worked perfectly. I find the voice prompts so pleasant that my family named her Miranda. She kept us on track for a long vacation this summer. I work for State government and have to visit county offices all of the place. I use the PDA features to track my appointments, expenses, and the like. I use the GPS features to get to where I am going without difficulty or delay. The included programs are easy to use and understand. Handwriting recognition is good.I just upgraded to the 3600 from the 3200. I loved the old and have found the new one to be everything and more."
1,Don't buy this!,"I purchased this refurbished unit a couple of weeks ago. It stopped working the day I bought it, but not before it completely messed up my palm desktop. And to add insult to injury, this unit is discontiuned and the one that I got was a very old version of the GPS. Buyer beware. If it sounds too good to true, it probably is!"
1,Invaluable - when it works,"You've read all the reviews here, and I certainly agree with most of them. I will never drive without a GPS system again, and the Garmin iQue offers substantial advantages over dealer OEM and other units.Here's the big problem though. The unit crashes frequently in the middle of a trip. The screen freezes and the unit cannot even be reset. You have to wait hours until the battery fully discharges, then place the unit in its cradle to recharge it.This is a huge disadvantage, and apparently, not one Garmin is very concerned about. Crashes did not start happening until after the warrant had expired.In short - you will love it, then you will hate it, maybe love it again, but eventually despise it."
1,Broken,"I didn't try to use my Garmin iQue for a couple of weeks after I bought it. Big mistake. The button/wheel on the left was broken - and if accidently touched, it would make the screen go crazy...jumping very fast from one icon to another. I had to leave it on top of my stove overnight because it started to get hot and I couldn't turn it off. What a piece of sh..! I am very disappointed and would like to return it, but the buyer said returns only for 1 week. If something is broken, the seller should say so in the ad. This is the first time I have ever bought anything used online, and it will be my last. Don't buy anything from this seller."
1,This is a lousy product,"This is a lousy product from Garmin. It is not ""out of the box ready to use"" - in fact not even close! It took me one whole day (almost) to set it up (with maps and everything) and it was not easy going through the process. I wonder why they did not pre-load the entire US map. Perhaps because it does not come with SD memory stick ($20 extra), but I would much rather have paid that extra. The antenna is VERY WEAK. Takes anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes before it locks on the satellite signal. My built-in car Navigation device does it instantly. It is an EXPENSIVE Palm Pilot....at the very best!"
1,Disappointing,"The alarm clock on the date application does not work.The gps receiver is too weak. It takes too long to lock in to satellites. I took a three-mile trip on busy streets testing the system. I got home before the iQue locked in on my position.The map data is out of date. I have used other mapping software for 3 years and am almost always able to find an address. The addresses I found 3 years ago aren't available on the software included with the iQue 3600The battery life is in adequate. Based on my experience, it only last for 30 minutes using the GPS.The interface is too complex.The ique won't pull out of the cradle without making a disturbing click. It won't life straight up or out. The only way to get it out is to lean it forward then pull."
1,Poor user interface!,"I can't believe so many people love this product. I love electronic gismos and rarely need to use instructions to figure how to work things. It took me for ever to figure out and too load maps. Once I got it working, it worked ok, but not great. Besides being hard to set up, it had three major problems.1) Poor user interface. Hard to figure out how to use. Can't use while driving.2) Short battery life. I many times lost important data because battery ran out too quickly.3)SD card slot doesn't hold card well. I loaded east and west coast maps into device. Went on vacation. When I came home, I used it as GPS and wondered why no detailed maps where there. My card fell out without my knowledge."
1,Disappointment,"I also just got this unit and was unable to install the maps. Finally got through to Garmin tech support and they told me the cd's were corrupted and I'd get replacements end of next week. To add insult to injury, Amazon dropped the price since I ordered it 9 days ago."
2,It's not reliable and crashes too frequently,"I've had my unit about 3 weeks - when it works, it's great - but it crashes almost daily and I'm sending it back tomorrow to Amazon.com. Also, when it crashes - you lose everything. I have a back-up on my computer, so I can reload everything again, but it's a big hassle. It really let me down this week when I was travelling back through Oregon and it just died. The developers need to go back to the drawing board. It has the making of an awesome piece of equipment, it's just not reliable and has too many problems."
2,Served me well until...,"I've had my Ique (aka Betty) for several years. It's helped me to go across the US several times, and then some. It has its quirks, and frequent crashes, etc - it's definitely not a turn-it-on-and-forget-it gadget. However, like the previous reviewer said, their software is not Vista-compatible - meaning, you can't sync your data (incl. map source) with your PC, rendering it useless unless you stick with XP! As far as I know, neither Palm nor Garmin plans to make the Palm Desktop Vista compatible anytime soon - which probably signals the end of the wonderful Palm OS... :("
5,Great Convergence of Technologies,"I have sort of wanted both a PDA and a GPS receiver for quite some time now, but haven't been able to justify the cost of either. As soon as I saw the iQue, the coolness factor of having both devices in one unit quickly convinced me that I absolutely had to have it.For a first generation device (albeit one that uses existing technology), it functions beautifully. Having never owned a PDA or a GPS, I find all the features very easy to learn and use. So far, the detailed maps have proven very accurate, the Palm OS, HotSync, and various applications are useful and user-friendly (still getting a hang of entering data using Grafiti, though), and the abilities of the navigation features blow me away.My only complaint is the paucity of internal memory, requiringat least a 256MB SD card, as has been noted in other reviews.Otherwise, this is a device with which I have fallen in love and expect to have a long and rewarding relationship."
5,Better than expected,"For biz travel, I quickly became addicted to the convenience and efficiency of the NeverLost system. The iQue is sleeker, more precise and user friendly. Our family was so impressed, we immediately bought stock in the company. If Garmin wins the contract(s) to factory equip major auto mfg's... look out.Per other reviews, the auto kit and minimum 256K card are essential. The manual is sparse (and conflicts with the CD and online guides.) The product itself is better than advertised. Practicals- not just geeks, will enjoy and use frequently."
3,"iQUE GREAT, MAPPING UPGRADE NOT","The Ique 3600 is great-very useful on my trips. However, I will not purchase a Garmin product again. Why? I paid $75 to to upgrade to city select. However, Garmin has the most bizarre unlock system I have ever seen! You will need at least five different codes! If you lose any slip of paper you are stuck. And the bonus is that every time you change PDA or have to reinstall after a crash...you got it. All over again. Of course their tech support is great. They guarantee an answer by the time you are back from your trip!So... think first if you want to spend your time hassling with this. Other GPS systems are much more reasonable in this and my next one will not be a Garmin. Remember how Quicken tax software tanked when they tried their lock system? Watch Garmin go there too.Bob"
1,They have design problems,"I am going on my third pda in the last 3 months. Can't keep the gps operational. They know they have hardware problems in this area. On the up side, the palm side seems to be fine and they have good customer service."
1,Difficult to use,I purchased this item for my husband for Christmas. He already had a palm and is quite computer literate. Neither one of us has been able to figure out how to use the navigation system. I tried to call Garmin for some assistance but gave up after being on hold for 45 min. I'm sure this is a great product once you've mastered it but it has been a very frustrating experience for us.
1,Not ready for market,"I spent 4 or 5 full days trying to set this up for my father in law. First of all, there were no detailed instructions for the unit. You had to go to the website to download them. We had to call Garmin many times during the setup, and a few times were told contradictory information from the instructions. This is not an easy piece of electronics. Not recommended for anyone who doesn't want to devote a heck of a lot of time to it. We never really got it up and running."
1,Condition of Garmin,It is difficult to give this product a good rating because it has not worked properly since we received it. There have been numerous issues and recently we had to return the device to Garmin for repair. Not sure what the outcome will be but we're waiting to hear from the company to learn if it can be repaired.
1,Poor battery performance,"When I first saw this unit advertised, I could not wait to purchase one.It has turned out to be the biggest piece of crap, I have ever wasted over $400 on!The batteries last no more than one half hour. When I brought this to the attention of Garmin, they admitted the bads performance, and suggest loading a new updated driver, which I did. Still no improvement. I would hate to be lost in the woods and have to depend on the GPS to help me.Do not buy this product unless they imporve the batteries"
1,IQue Palm Series Garmin PDA/GPS won't run on Vista,"WARNUNG! The IQue Palm Series Garmin PDA/GPS handheld systems will no longer be able to run through Microsoft PC based platforms. This will render any of the Palm series IQue 3500 and other Garmin Palm OS based systems useless in so far as Windows Vista is concerned. Garnmin has no plans to port their Palm Desktop drivers, and sync software to Vista."
4,Garmin iQue 3600 PDA,"The Garmin iQue 3600 PDA is an excellent product. It takes a little time to learn the function of the device. Once you learn it, then its a cake walk.Pro: 1. Expandable slot for additional memory. I recommend the 1 GB. It can load 3/4 of the U.S. on it.2. The device is compact and easy to travel with it. Make sure you take the car travel kit w/u.3. It have all the function of a PDA and more.Con: 1. Battery life is too short when using the GPS. The battery cannot be change or purchase additional battery, because the battery is build in. You have to mail the device back to Garmin for replacement.2. When the GPS is turn on in a new location. It take a couple of minutes to locate satalite.3. It does not always give the shortest route. But it give the most common route.It is worth the $$$$. Happy Travel."
1,Do Not Buy This Until They Fix the Kinks,"I had problems twice with this item, and Amazon tried to replace it without success. First, the cradle did not fit the item properly. Then, the second unit I received had problems with the touch screen. When I wrote to Amazon about this, they said the problems with this product were ""widespread."" The product, if it works, would be great. I hope they fix whatever is wrong with it, but until then, buy at your own risk."
3,Great GPS - Poor Virtual Graffiti,"The GPS function is awesome and it's size is easy to carry. If you're looking primarily for navigation purpose this PDA is great. If you're looking for PIM primarily, you might be disappointed by it's poor graffiti input. The ique 3600 seems to suffer from normal speed graffiti text input compared to other palm os 5.2.X devices. It has difficulty recognizing ""K""s, ""4""s and most of my ""O""s appear as square in the virtual graffiti input area. Overall text entries respond with noticeable delays. I'm still very happy with my purchase and I will continue to use it on travels but it was necessary for me to purchase another PDA, Palm Tungsten E, for my daily PIM's."
2,An electronics fan from CT,RETURNED UNIT. NEW ONE WORKS AS ADVERTISED. NOT SURE IF REPLACEMENT UNIT WAS BRAND NEW OR REFURBISHED. UNIT CAME PRE-LOADED WITH NEW SOFTWARE. STILL NOT IMPRESSED WITH GARMIN CUSTOMER SUPPORT.Don't waste your precious time and money on this unit. I received this for a Christmas gift and was thrilled with the concept. Finally a device that integrated both GPS and Palm applications. Right out of the box I encountered several problems with the unit. It would continuously hard reset itself. I sent an email to Garmin and never received a response. After doing a little research on the web I discovered this is a common problem with this device. I uploaded the new software as recommended and now the unit can not acquire a satellite signal. I then tried to contact Garmin's customer support and have been waiting to talk with someone for over an hour.Bottom line: Don't waste your money. Item was rushed to market without working out the bugs. Also Garmin has no customer support.
1,Good Idea - Poor Execution,"This is a pretty weak product across the board. Even with the updated OS, it crashes unpredictably. Took it on a trip from SF to Oregon (multiple destinations), and it worked very well. Tried to route to Tucson, AZ for my next trip, and nothing but calculation errors.On a short hop inside CA, it got me to the destination just fine. Coming back, it crashed, loosing all data.The documentation is one of the big weak spots. Looks like they wrote the documentation for a similar design, but not the same product. Makes a lot of assumptions and sometimes takes you through a process that does not describe the options the same way they appear on the system. Support also sucks. I was having problems with the IR port, and the docs say to read a separate document on the CD. The document isn't there. I contacted Technical Support, and they said to read the Help. The Help says read the document. When I told TS about this, I was told to post a message on the newsgroup. Ugly!"
2,"Works ok, but that is all","Great display, somewhat slow redraw. Menu's need a lot of work, not very intuitive.Car mount speaker failed after two weeks. Fuze not user replaceable. Mount not very well designed.Buy this unit for graphics, but that is all.This unit was put on the market before all the bugs were worked out.Garmin should know better, I had problems with a Garmin Marine GPS I ordered several years ago.Producing a quality product for initial release should have a higher priority at Garmin.Wait to buy if you can. Maybe they will correct the initial flaws."
2,"Nice Idea, When it Works","When it actually picks up a satelite or two or three, it works like a charm. The problem is finding the satelites. I can understand problems downtown, but not on the open highway. Unless my car is made of thick lead - and I don't think it is - then I do not understand the poor reception. When it connects, it works fine and is helpful. When it doesn't connect, which is often, it does survive being thrown around the car."
4,Works Well With a Few Caveats,"After a couple days of a difficult installation, I got it to work. And it does work well. It's a real bargain compared to $$$$$ systems and it's portable so you can take it from car to car.However, if you live in a major city be prepared to purge your entire contact database and devote the device to being just a GPS only. The maps take ALOT of memory. Be prepared to spend another $$$$ on memory expansion.All that being said, I am happy with the device as I didn't need the PDA functions anyways."
3,Garmin iQue 3600,"Provides good navigation cues. Palm compatability makes it easy to keep addresses and phone numbers. My only two complaints are that the maps are out of date for my area (Dallas), and that sometimes the geolocation is off enough that the Garmin can't tell that I'm on a highway or a service road."
4,WOW! It worked,"All the software related problems mentioned in other reviews are gone. I just received my package from Amazon.com, day before yesterday. It came with version 2.x+ software. I tested it from my work (Mountain View,CA) to my home (San Jose, CA). I didn't encounter any problem,and got very accurate direction, turn by turn. I also bought travel kit, but didn't use yet. It lost GPS connection when I parked my Honda Pilot inside my garage. Other basic Plam features are also very cool.The only drawback could be when you are on the road, say, out on vacation, to find a location could be difficult, without storing it first in the address book, though I didn't get a chance to read the complete manual yet. So you may have to carry a laptop or an external portable keyboard interface (I don't know whether you get for this unit or not, but you get for other Palm models). So I will rate it 4 for the time being.Will update as soon as I get a chance to use it more."
4,Great interpretations of great songs.,"Joshua Redman is one of the best of the jazz saxophonists active today. For a young guy he is steeped in tradition and has a rich musical heritage. This shows in the set list here. Redman moves from classic show tunes like ""Summertime"", ""How Deep Is The Ocean"", and ""Love For Sale"" to 'contemporary' songs by Prince, Stevie Wonder, The Beatles etc. with little or no effort. Some people complain that Redman is too polished. I don't know about that. Perhaps. Either way, this disc is a strong effort. The interpretations are enjoyable and evocative. The interludes run the gamut from haunting (Interlude 1) to forgettable, but most are only about 30 seconds long. In the end I'm left with a pretty satisfied feeling.Recommended."
4,Good Jazz,Joshua has done a CD bordering on the commercial but which should provide some likable material for the classical jazz fan. I think the pieces done on tenor are the strongest but given the popularity of the soprano sax these days others may take a different view. It would be interesting to speculate on what the artist would record in the absence of the influence of agents and record executives. This overall is a good addition to my jazz collection and I am sure everyone can find something on this disk to their liking.
4,Another great effort from the best sax player alive!!!,"""Timeless"" is destined to be just that, as J.R. nails his interpretations of all the standards he chooses to cover on his latest album. Interspersed between the 10 songs are 7 thirty to forty-five second interludes that are a nice touch. overall this is not as heroic as his earlier work, but it is a vast imrpovement from ""Freedom In The Groove"". I strongly urge any Josh Redman fans to check it out, or non-jazz listeners as well, as this may be your perfect introduction to what is an amazingly expressive artform and musical style."
4,Joshua Going Mainstream?,"For hard core Redman fans, this CD may be a disappointment. Maybe it was an economic move by the record label: expand the Redman reach to ""soft jazz"" radio while depriving the ""traditional jazz"" crowd of the fantastic riffs and improvisations that made the previous Redman works so exciting. In summary, ""Timeless Tales"" is decent, but not on a par with ""Freedom In The Groove"" or ""Wish."""
3,Pretty Good but to Polished,Joshua Redman is a Solid Talent but His Choice of Material is Very Predictable.his Group is Alright.Redman is real Polished and that Hurts His Music as far as Overall Depth cuz some Meat in their would Give it a Raw feel.I saw a Live Video tape of His Stage stuff a Long time ago and he was Tight so he isn't all to Blame.The Biz can force a Talent to Water down his or her work.it's ashame.also way too many covers in his work.still you can't deny his Talent.
5,Tenderlicious,The Country Cut beef jerky is wonderful. I never thought beef jerky could be so tender and tasty. No more boring snacks - the Teriyaki flavor makes this beef jerky a special treat every time.
2,Tough and too greasy for my taste,Not a very good jerky. I prefer several other drier jerky products. They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product from their store.
2,Bait and Switch,"I ordered this teriyaki beef jerky base on the free sample that came with another order (which is a great way to promote the product). I thought it tasted really good and wanted more, however the teriyaki jerky i recieved tasted nothing like the sample i was given. This was really dissapointing because i was really excited to recieve this product. Some people might like this, but i find it has a weird overpowering flavor that is really offputting. I did order the honey pepper also and that is much better get that one instead!"
2,Way too salty for me,"Teriyaki is something I use on the grill all the time. It's a specific flavor and one that I love. But in this jerky, the flavor just seems to become way too salty. The jerky from Buffalo Bills is very moist and tender it's true, but it also has a wetness to it when you reach into the bag that I didn't find appealing. Have had better teriyaki jerky and would not order this again."
5,It's Alright,"Today was the first day I've ever tried Buffalo Bill brand Beef Jerky. It was at my door in like 4 days, which was sweet. The expiration date does not stand out and was hard to read. But best I can tell I've got 11 months until it expires.I had the Honey Pepper earlier and really enjoyed it (A++++++) and polished off a 1.75 oz bag in a minute. The Teriyaki was very good and worthy of a 5 star. I would recommend the Honey Pepper if options are available, but this was really good beef jerky.I highly recommend the moist and tender teriyaki beef jerky, eh!!!"
3,Adequate,"Wish I didn't have to still buy these but my old dad won't go digital with email and banking, biotch"
4,Red Book,This book is a great resource. It tells the genealogist where to search for virtually any vital records.
2,Red Book,"If you're a novice genealogist, this book will give you addresses to state agencies but, it will not give you anything more. I was looking for something that I could retrieve in a ""online"" mode but, there is not a lot of that out there, not yet anyway."
2,Book of Reference Items,Book of reference material available for ancestry search. Not very helpful for me but a great tool.
5,The RED BOOK has the answers when searching a new locality!,"So you're making a little progress in your family history research, having interviewed most of your older relatives. NOW you need to begin looking at the records created in the localities where your ancestors once lived! For US researchers, the RED BOOK is an essential reference book!NEED TO KNOW -- WHEN a county was created? WHERE the probate records are kept? WHAT the migration patterns were? IF there are surviving church records of christening, marriage and burial? HOW the county boundaries changed over the years?The RED BOOK has the answers! I always turn to it when helping someone at our local LDS Family History Center. The RED BOOK gets you quickly up to speed on what to expect when researching a particular state.This one is on my ""A"" list!!! Myrt"
4,Another Essential Genealogy Reference,"I purchased this book by accident, actually. I already had the Handybook for Genealogists and considered the two to be too close in content to justify the expenditure. I received an offer for the purchase of the Red Book at a discount and jumped on it, only to realize later what I had done. I thought about returning it, once it arrived.However, after sitting down and doing a side-by-side comparison of the two books, I realized that there is some very different information between the two. Both are quite useful, and if I ever question information in one (come on, that's what we DO) I have a second source to confirm the first. I find myself reaching for this book time after time, and not just to confirm info from the Handybook. There are certain things I find easier to understand in the Red Book, not to mention the different perspective offered.This book is, simply put, indispensible!"
5,"Ancestry's Red Book: American State, County & Town Sources, Third Revised Edition",I devote about 30 hours a week working on my genelogy. This book is invaluable to me.
3,"A good introduction, though I would have liked more depth.","The Kalacharkra is a Peace Mandala and sacred symbol for Buddhists, especially in Tibet. It is said to be 2,600 years old and to have originated with the Buddha himself. This video shows the how four Tibetan Buddhist monks build the intricate symbol out of sand in Dublin, Ireland. They worked for eight hours a day for three weeks to create it only to ritualistically dismantle it during a study on impermanence. Though I very much enjoyed watching the way the monks built the mandala in such a meditative and dedicated way, I would have preferred more in depth understanding of meaning of some of the symbolism. Some mention was made of key elements making this a good video for the curious and the beginner, but I would enjoyed more. This is especially true since I was surprised to find out when I got the video it was only 30 minutes long!"
1,Just go work out,"I took this to drop 7 extra pounds before prom and needless to say it did not work. loosing weight requires the burning of calories, which comes from working out, not spraying tasty water in your mouth. Maybe the US wouldn't be so obese if we ran instead of bought crazy mystical miracle sprays"
1,A waste,"This brand is very appealing with a great promise. When it arrived, I was very excited, the product looked good, the packaging and the branding is very funky. However it did absolutely nothing for me, I honestly believe that I am not just an exception. This is just like a mouth freshener with a bit of minty taste and smell that wears off almost immediately. I am never going to buy anything else from this brand and suggest you don't waste your time and money on this product."
1,Vastly overproduced,"How Bruce Kimmel and a bunch of fantastic singers that I normally love could produce such a rotten album is beyond me. The problem really lies in the horrible arrangements and orchestrations of each song; they seem to have been done in cliched, heavy-handed, pop-Broadway style without regard for what this delicate material really requires--or, for that matter, what GOOD Broadway-style arrangements require. Some entity named Lan88 is the culprit, but Bruce Kimmel should have known better."
1,Not worth the money,"I was given one of these as a gift a little over a year ago. Today it decided to die in the same way a couple of other reviewers note, but I'm not convinced it was due to a surge. The unit still works for a short time before it overheats and shuts the outlets off, and you can't actually turn the thing off, as the rocker switch isn't working (no click, no off, and no alarm). I also had two Isobar units plugged in to this line and they are fine, registering no issue. Seems that the HT800 is no better than the HT700 was, which is to say the units are garbage. Monster has shown me once again why their products aren't worth the money."
1,"Did not protect, warranty is rediculous.","I purchased this to protect a lot of my expensive equipment. When my apartment was struck by lightning, the power supply failed to protect most of the components. I lost my computer, Yamaha receiver, Nintendo Wii, Wireless router, and HP printer. I figured I could call upon the warranty to get my stuff fixed, but the monster claim process is worse than most insurance companies. Fill out 3 pages, draw out a diagram, send all your equipment to certified manufacturer repair shop, wait for all the quotes, send them to monster, and then wait 4 weeks for a response. I am still waiting to get my stuff fixed. I guess I could deal with this if i new the chances were really low because the surge protector would actually work... I would not recommend this at all."
4,great deal,"great price on Amazon, meets my needs perfectly. have HDTV, cable box, receiver, subwoofer, Blu-ray, and antenna plugged in without any space issues. flat outlet plug is a plus"
4,Good value,"Good value for the price, given it includes power conditioning. Plenty of outlets for common accessories, spread out to fit in those ""wall wart"" power adapters."
5,Monster Cable MP HT800 Home Theater PowerCenter,"when i got this item by mail, and i open it, for a moment i thought amazon sent me the wrong one because the thing was not what it looked like in the picture, but then i notice that its the same type, but other than that its a good surge protector, i needed one because i recently bought a sony high definition television plus i have so many stuff to plug into. its a good product, i would definitely recommend it"
4,Good Product but over priced,"While this is a very good product, iot like all Monster products is about 40% over priced. Thee are cheaper solutions with a lower price tag. Received quickly."
4,"Great product, useful looks could improve","Although the product is great and the protection indicator gives you a sense of security, the looks could improve. Easy to install, and easy to mount on walls in a vertical position."
3,Cheaply made.,"This product appears to work fine, but it feels hollow and no different then any other cheap AC strip for less money. The unit gets hot and I dont see the difference for the money I paid. Monster claims all these features attached but I see a hollow box with some wires. I believe I over paid. Don't go by lables when buying a product. The product should be UL listed for a specific purpase. Be sure that any strip you purchase is designed for your electronic equipments loads etc."
4,"Works great, but expensive",Haven't really noticed a big difference in picture or sound quality since I started to us this surge protector. Might have cleared the signal coming from the cable box a little. Mostly bought in fear of a power spike killing my home theater equipment.
5,Have more than 1,Monster is a dependable product. I have 1 at home already and needed another one. All our electronics are on Monster Surge Protectors. Wouldnt have it any other way.
3,Not Quite Right,I purchased the dark brown pair of these through here from Target. These are very cute flops the only thing I guess I wasn't expecting was how sort of stiff and cardboardy they feel when you put them on.The thong part between the toes felt comfy and the straps never bothered me but these really need some major wearing in for them to be comfy to walk on in my opinion.The only other thing that I will mention is the inside of the arch where the strap goes inbetween the layers it bulges up a bit right at the edge of the inside of your arch.It's not a huge big deal and it could be the way my foot is made but that's the only part I didn't like about it. I keep them in my closet because I still think they are very pretty so I wear them on occasion.As cheap and nice as these look I wouldn't really recommend them.
5,Can't put it down...,"What a great story, all the more so because it is true! I could hardly put this book down and I enjoyed every minute reading it.I highly recommend this book."
1,annapolis goes crazy over this insane story,Dateline Annapolis 2005:City dock is abuzz over this tale by David Mercy. The worlds' capitol for sailing has had several bookstores feature this book in storefront displays. It is a simple tale and the narrator moves seemlessly from a simple folksy style a la Hemingway to breathless descriptives evoking Wilbur Smith comparisons. It seems like a tall tale yet if you can find the documentary from Norway TV One you understand the book is understated. It is highly recommended and is a fast read.
1,Have the authors seen the show?,"The plot dragged out for far too long, loosing my interest with well over one hundred pages left to go, and wasn't even original. The season two episode The Tower, which had aired in December of 2005, months before this book came out, dealt with the same topic of ""genetic superiority"" determining the ruling class. Also, the characterizations didn't ring true at all. Dr. McKay was made out to be stupid, and Teyla was written as judgmental and cruel. If you like Stargate Atlantis, stay away from this mockery of a book."
2,Disappointing character development,"Still an enjoyable read for Stargate Atlantis diehards but characterizations didn't ring true, especially Dr McKay's portrayal. In the tv series, he is eccentric and sometimes clueless, but not repeatedly stupid as was portrayed. The personalities seemed to be contrived so that the plot would work, rather than to be true to their development on the tv series and made the characters seem lacking in depth and intelligence.Interesting plot and plot development; just would be nice to have more accurate character portrayal."
4,Trinity-like,"This SGA tie-in novel is set after The Storm and leads nicely into The Defiant One. It reminded me a lot of Trinity - Rodney's arrogance reared its ugly head once more but this time, it didn't lead ""just"" to the destruction of an uninhabited solar system, it caused the downfall of a whole civilization. The thing is, I could see both sides of the argument, Rodney and Teyla's - they were both right and wrong, both operating on limited information. Rodney's behavior fit well his season 1 self when all his concerns were more about him than about others, when he was still learning how to care. And a healthy dose of hurt Sheppard didn't hurt either, of course."
3,old film but good concepts,"the actress' hairstyle and dress is from the 80s. the film quality was scratchy and blurry, but if you can see pass that, there are some phonics and sight-reading. My toddler son tried to pay attention, but had a hard time watching."
3,What can one expect from a textbook?,This book is very handy when studying thermodynamics. The tables in the back of it are very complete and accurate. They are also easy to use with minimal instruction. Having both english and SI units in the tables is also quite convenient. These books usually come with a cd but mine was missing since the book was used when I bought it. I also have the 6th edition of this book but the 5th is organized differently and in my opinion is slightly better. Cycles are mentioned at the beginning and elaborated upon at the end so the information in between seems less random like it has a direction.
2,Fair/Poor,"As many other reviewers have noted, this book often trouble for the ME undergrad. Unfortunately, myself and my classmates are trying to teach ourselves the material due to the lack of a decent professor. This book alone will probably be more of a frustration than a source of understanding. With over 800 pages, its way too much to cover in one semester of an undergrad thermo course. Our entire class is floundering, and our professor has had to curve grades heavily to keep the majority of us from failing. So, this might not be the best book for undergraduate students who are trying to actually learn the material. You will spend most of your time guessing what to do, unless you have a good professor."
1,"horrible, timewasting, braindead book","I don't see how this title ever made it to the printing press. Nothing here makes sense. Ideas are thrown at the reader in random order, without any detailed explanations. The chapter problems are completely useless. Some assume too much knowledge of other areas of study, some try to make you apply concepts which were only mentioned in passing and no examples given. In short, I felt like I was dragged around in a sewer when I read this book.Steer clear."
1,Poor,"This could be one of the worst text books I've ever had to spend an entire semester with. The chapter reading had little bearing on the problems and the formulas presented were often not enough information to solve them. I don't like complaining about books, but, I spent the vast majority of my time unsuccesfully attempting to solve problems that were not at all like the examples. It is important to learn by doing problems on your own, not copying examples, but this is ridiculous."
1,utter garbage,"It's true what they say, John Wiley & Sons will publish any piece of trash submitted to them. This book is a prime example. Essentially you get a kick in the teeth and than they ask you to do completely incoherent problems. Material is difficult to follow. The problems often seem like they have nothing to do with the text. In the end, I was reduced to one of those students who memorize formulas, and do everything exactly by the book. But since most problem have no examples to guide the student, I was forced to waste hours and think them through, but half of it was guesswork and that's no way to learn. Needless to say, a simple general physics book will teach you more thermodynamics if it's written well."
4,A College level book,"Warning, this book is a college level Thermodynamics book written for students who are pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering. As one reviewer pointed out, this book, unfortunately, will force you to think and will not simply provide you with the formulas necessary to solve all the problems in the back. I purchased this book as a supplement to the required text for the thermo course I was taking. I found it extremely helpful in filling in the gaps left by my text with many thorough example problems. I have recommended this book to our faculty as a replacement to our current text."
4,Pretty Good Text Book,"Why so many bad reviews?I found this text to be quite good, the format of the book was appropriate, with essential concepts highlighted and the explanations are fairly clear.However what really makes this book stand out is the example problems, lots of them and each one has ""Assumptions"" listed so you can tell the difference between a real world situation and what's assumed in the example. In general that's what makes this book so good, the authors go to the trouble of pointing out that many of the concepts presented are for idealized situations, and that the real world is different.This book is alright to use in conjunction with the Feynman lectures on physics, if you want a different explanation of thermodyanmic concepts, while still retaining some of the real world flavor this books problems have."
2,Good plot doesn't always make a good movie,"I remember when I was little I saw this flick real late at night and absolutely loved it (although I saw it under the title, ""Killing Box""). Not too long ago I found Grey Knight at the ol' Blockbuster and was sooo excited I rented it (good thing I talked myself out of buying it). While ripe with cameos, (i.e. Billy Bob Thorton, David Arquette, Martin Sheen, etc) this movie was just plain bad. I must have been really easy to please in my youth. Grey Knight, I do have to say, has a great idea for a film but the directors handled it very poorly. With a touch more of plot development, budget, effects, as well as a change of director this could have been an excellent movie. I'd love to see someone remake it because it does really have an interesting story. Overall, I'd watch it again if it was on TV but I wouldn't recommend spending money to rent it."
4,"Pretty, not Sturdy","This coat stand looks great when assembled. It does have a tendency to loosen up at the points where it screws together. Also, one must balance the coats along the top, as the bottom is not that heavy."
2,OK item - terrible shipping,"I ordered this item as a gift. I very disappointed to find when it arrived that the pieces of the stand had not been wrapped at all for shipping. The long pole pieces were in plastic bags, but all the smaller pieces were unwrapped and rattling around in the box. As a result, a chip was knocked off the pole, and there were gouges from screws elsewhere. The wood & general construction of the stand seems good quality, but as you can imagine, I couldn't give this as a gift to anyone. Very upsetting!"
3,It's ok. Just ok.,"For the price, it's not bad. When it arrived, the based was completely cracked off (where the feet slide into the shaft) in 2 of the 3 slots. Luckily, I was able to fix it with wood glue but the repairs show. Even so, it performs the function I bought it for in my office. Not the most stable but, since I don't plan to pole dance on it, it holds up my jacket up well."
3,It's a coat rack,the price was good. the wife likes it. it was easy to assemble. it was a fast delivery. you get what you pay for. it serves it's purpose. the wife is happy so then I am happy.
2,Cracked,"It seemed nice; however there was a crack in the stand so I had to return it. I emailed the company to see if they could just send a replacement since it was annoying to have to disassemble the whole thing and put it back in the box, but they never wrote back. I just returned the whole thing and found a comparable one at Christmas Tree Shop for half the price!"
2,Great until it falls over,"Worked great while it lasted. Hung many types of clothing, hats, and bags regardless of weight however broke after only a few months. Material they use for the legs are weak. If you have a small child who likes to discover their surroundings, would advise a stronger stand with strong legs."
4,Oak Coat Rack,This is a great coat rack. It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. The color and design fit perfectly with the room decor. It is definitely worth the price.
1,Chinese Junk,Crappiest design and material. I have had to glue it three times already. Save your $$ for something of higher quality.
1,Disappointed,"When I got the hall tree I put it together, the legs kept falling off and it is very unsturdy. Then within two days it developed cracks around the base where you attach the legs. It is not a well made product and I'm very disappointed in it. Didn't even make it two days in my house without me needing to do more work to it."
5,Great coat rack!,"This is really a NICE coat rack. It is made really well and the wood is actually pretty. Very easy and quick to put together. Sits straight and is sturdy. I just bought it to use in my bedroom for nightwear, robes, and other things. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this item to everyone. Love it!One one question about it..On the very top, where it is rounded, it is cut flat with a screw hole in it. Like there is supposed to be another piece added. You really can't see it unless you are tall.I am 5'7"" and only saw it when I was putting it together. The instructions don't show that a piece goes there and one isn't included. They should omit the screw hole on the top end, to be more professional."
1,Defective. Broke in one month,The weight of a couple of jackets snapped off two of the arms and broke the legs. It is very poorly constructed.
1,Disappointing. Broke the first day.,"I thought I was going to write a rave review of this item. It was amazingly easy to assemble without any tools needed. Unfortunately, less than a day after I assembled it, and before I hung any coats, the wood in the base cracked and the coat rack was unusable. Amazon is good with returns, but it is still a hassle to take the coat rack apart, pack it up and take it to a UPS Store. I think a metal coat rack would be a better idea."
5,"Super easy, piece a cake","This is super easy to set up, no need of instruction, even grandma and a 6 yrs old can do. Looks nice, doesn't look cheap, looks nostalgic and mainly, works very good. We hang our coats, pocket books and sometimes even bookbacks. Strongly buy."
5,Great Looking,Very nice product it only took me 7 mins to put it together. The finish is excellent but it's not oak.
2,Absolute Garbage,For $25 I should have known what I was buying. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. This thing is 100% Chinese garbage.
3,It is not the color it appears to be in the picture.,"The rack is not the color the picture makes it out to be... mine was blanched oak, near white-wood."
2,Poor Quality,This item arrived when expected and was packaged well. During assembly the center post of the rack cracked with very little pressure applied.
4,DONT PUT TO MANY ON,Dont put to many coats on the rack. it might break... it is nice and looks just like the picture...
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Terrible item! Yes, the price was right...but really? I basically just threw away $20. It was pretty and easy to assemble.The praise stops there. Immediately one leg broke off of the stand. It takes wood with the break and cannot be fixed. OK, so I left it leaning until I could have a handy family friend take a look at it. My son in law moves something beneath it and...another leg breaks off! So...trash it is. Don't waste your money!"
3,Over all very good product.,The product looks good and it does the job. The only issue I have is that one of the screws for the legs would not completely screw in and the screws themselves seam to be made of a very soft metal. they are east to strip. I had to replace the one screw.
2,Not very durable,"Bought for son and after a few weeks with three coats hung on it, it broke. Also, with coats on it it once tipped over and cracked a window it hit. Not recommended for anything but lightweight and few coats"
4,Coat tree..,We have a very small entry area and no coat closet.The coat tree is the perfect remedy for our guests winter coats & jackets.
3,Legs needed extra reinforcement,It arrived on time and really looked nice. Only complaint was that the legs only had the one screw and did not stay together so had to get wood glue to reinforce them. Once that was done it serves its purpose.
1,Arrived missing a piece.,"When it arrived, it was missing a piece, the little screw-in bit for one of the pegs wasn't in the tree. It wasn't enough hassle to return it, I've just got the side with a missing peg in the back, but it was enough to warrant looking into getting a different brand. It was also much lighter than I expected it to be..."
3,NMSENIOR,Product delivered without inserts in 2 of the attachment holes. Looks and works good after buying inserts for the 2 holes and repairing stand. If it had been complete rating would have been 5 stars.
5,Great deal for the price!!,I wasn't sure it was sturdy enough for my needs but took a chance anyway. It's all I hoped for. It handles heavy winter coats without a problem and was easy to assemble.
1,Piece of Junk,"I plugged my new Sony Bravia 37"" LCD TV into the product.9Months later all you had to do is touch the power strip and the tv would go off. Plug tv in regular outlet and everything else was fine. Caution, watch out Best Buy employees pushing this product when they should not. It's inferior quality for $32.00 price."
1,Suddenly stopped working,I had this about a year and mysteriously nothing plugged into it worked. Thought I had blown a breaker. Finally figured out this thing just suddenly stopped working... no reset.. no on/off.. just stopped working. Seems to be a lot of this happening with this strip. Now I have to spend more money on a good one.
1,Broke after 9 Months,"I bought this, and it broke after 9 months. I contacted Monster to get a replacement, but they refused to replace it without verification I purchased it from an authorized retailer. I was amazed that they would lose a customer (and face reviews like this) for a $10 surge protector."
2,"A LITTLE ""WEAK"" IN ENDURANCE !!","After a year, the unit started shutting off, the least little touch of the rocker switch would bring it back to life for a short time !! Monster said they would replace it--$4.75 to ship back and would have to buy an interim unit !! But, hey all things wear out, but the Monster reputation takes a hit with this one !!"
4,Works great,The plug end does not swivel like the Belkin model. I had to pull out the receptacle from the wall and turn it over so that the power cable would point downward.
5,does it's job,"I like the color coding and labeling I just wish I could write in my own labels. Good product, would buy another one."
1,These are Terrible!!,I usually do not write reviews but this product is so bad I felt I had too. I bought 2; one failed within 3 months and the other in 4. You should spend a bit more and buy a better product that lasts. Thanks!
3,Works only for my tv,"Does not fit most of my products, for ex..netgear, modem box ...due to the type of input plugs and how the are made. I had to use a different type of power protector where the inputs are not side by side. Somewhat dissapointed. It does fit my Samsung TV, but I guess I'll have to just wait and see how it holds up."
1,burned for no reason,"I bought this product 2 years ago, and it stopped working for no reason while I was watching TV. Monster customer service was really inefficient, I gave up. Would definitely recommend against buying this product"
1,Monster AV600 Surge Protector,"I bought 3 of these surge potectors last year. Less that 2 months the reset button tripped on the first one and wouldn't reset. Now, the second one has followed suit and exact same thing happened to it. The third one was still in the box so I got it plugged it in and wouldn't you know it...It doesn't work at all. I have bought several Monster items over the years but this one was a total waste of time and money. Oh, it has a 5 yr warranty, try to contact Monster for a replacement. Good Luck"
1,Not even a minute,"I plugged in the unit, I plugged in a couple of small electronics, and I flipped the switch. The power switch light came on, but not the protection led, so no power."
1,Utter crap,"Power strip starting buzzing after a few months use. Now dead. Not worth the cost to ship back for warranty repair. Just don't bother with this inferior product. I'm so sour on Monster as a company as this is the 3rd product of theirs to fail me in the past 2 years, the others being a HDP 1800 and a HTS 950. Premium prices, garbage product."
1,Horrible quality/reliability,"I bought this as needed a power strip and thought the color coding would make life easier with the TV and components. Several of the plugins died within a month. Threw it away and bought a ""normal-basic"", cheaper Home Depot one and have had not problems."
5,So far so good....,"Contrary to many negative reviews claiming this fails quickly, I haven't experienced that with either of my two.They are both still working correctly.One with my Home theater, and the other with a PC.I will update this review if i have any problems."
4,"I own three of these, not quite enough sockets for AV use.","I own three of these, and they are high quality. For the price, this is a great replacement for most generic protectors. It only has 6 outlets though, and doesn't quite meet the needs of a full computer set up or full AV set up. (I use two for my computer equipment, and one for kitched appliances)."
2,nice but broke soon,"Looks and feels nice, but broke after two weeks. I used it for rather high power appliances (3kW total) though."
5,Excellent cord length and quality,"The two big selling points of this product for me was1. Extra long cord length2. Excellent Build QualityThe product came with outlets pre-labeled and some sticker ribbons for the user to attach to the cords themselves. These are helpful, except when you want to plug in something that is not audio / video related. (Not really that big of an issue though...haha.)"
5,Does the job,I bought this item last month and I use it for the new HDTV I recently purchased as well. The minute you take it out of the package you can tell you have a great quality product that will do the job. So far so good. Works as advertised!! Highly recommended!
1,Failed After 1 Month,"This item failed after one month of use.There seem to be two breakers in this item:The first one is tied to the ""reset"" button. This circuit is closest to the shared socket side.The second one is tied to the ""on/off switch"". This circuit is closest to the wall side.The on/off switch is still lit up.However, none of the devices are getting power. The Reset button is useless and does not work.This item will be returned."
1,"Inferior specs, Inferior design, malodorous cord, get the Belkin","On July 7 2007 I received from Amazon the Monster Cable MP AV600 Power Protector and the Belkin SurgeMaster Superior Series 8-Outlet Surge Protector (6', 1770 Joules). They both sold for about the same price. The Monster is vastly inferior. The Belkin has three times the Joules rating. The Belkin is much more attractive and well designed. The Monster is just a squarish standard strip that felt very cheap compared to the Belkin and worst of all the Monster had a bad rubber stink and the cord felt gritty. The Belkin had a smooth white power cord. My other mistake was to get the Belkin with the 6 foot cord , I realized a 12 foot cord was available after ordering. You will be MUCH happier with the Belkin. I will post this exact review with the Belkin as well. Last time I gave something 1 star Amazon did not display it. Maybe the higher end Monster models are nicer."
1,Burned out in 5 minutes,Perhaps my experience wasn't common but I plugged this surge protector into the outlet and within seconds smelled burning parts. Needless to say it never worked and wasn't what I expected especially overpaying for a Monster Cable product. I also purchased a more expensive Monster Cable surge protector and that is holding up so far.
3,Burned out after about a year,"Liked the color-coding on this power protector which made it easy to unplug exactly what i wanted without guessing which outlet it was connected to. Died after a year of use, all of a sudden burned out with an awful smell. There was no power fluctuation, we were just watching tv and all of a sudden everything turned off."
5,It Saved my Home Theater!!!,"During a recent blizzard (Michigan) a large electrical problem blew out 4 substations and a large number of transformers resulting a wide spread 12 hour+ power outage. The resultant surge toasted out my dishwasher and track lights. However, the Monster AV600 saved my expensive home theater setup, although the AV600 got toasted also. IT DID IT'S JOB and I give it the highest recommendation possible. Great product at a low price. Thanks Monster!!"
5,NO COMPLAINTS,Love the color coding. Makes it easy to know which plug is which. I have no complaints and love the price.
4,Excellent value for the money,"It's great to have the color-coding for each of your components, and I believe that Monster is a reliable brand. It may have been nice to have a coax connection to protect my sat receiver, but I am a bit dubious of the actual utility of coax connection surge suppressors. I suspect that, in general, surges are very rare or nonexistent from satellite dishes to the receivers, unless brought on by a lightening strike, in which case, any surge suppressor would be unlikely to withstand the strike. Because of this, I saw this particular power protector as the perfect solution for my needs."
3,Monster Cable,Is a good item if all of the plugs you are using stand upright and are standard sized. I got it to sit against a wall for sideways plugs. Holds plugs tightly so you'll have to push a little. No problems with it so far.
1,review of Monster Surge protector,The product I received is defective. When a plug is inserted into the outlet it is so tight it pushed the contacts down into the unit so they do not work.Can it be exchanged?Thxdave stroble
1,The thing fried,"After a few weeks the thing just fried. All devices plugged into it went off. The rest button did nothing. Exactly the same as what Douglas Schifter wrote in a previous review. No damage to any devices but I don't even thing there was a power surge. The lights (plugged in elsewhere) did not flicker. The thing just burned out. That's not very ""Monster"". I've replaced it with a surge/power strip made for computers (3000 joules protection) that was half the price of the Audio/Video Monster version (1400 joules protection). Monster is overpriced and inferior."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"After taking almost an hour to cut through the plastic casing this was packaged in, I couldn't believe I couldn't fit any plug into the outlets, despite putting my full body weight into the effort. Upon calling the manufacturer, I was told that yes, it is, at first, very difficult to plug anything in!"
4,Good for good purpose./,This is a well respected book for those interested in clinically restructuring obsolete belief systems. A must read for those interested in getting mental issues handled and eradicated systematically from a language standpoint.
2,I have no idea!,"If you have no idea what NLP is, then forget about reading this book. I thought that NLP was confusing, this book just confused me even more. You must be in a special frame of mind to get this stuff. I read it, very slowly, and that proved to me that when you try to improve on something that a genius created (Bandler, NLP) then you must be more of a genius to understand it!Be nice, smile, ask, and you will get what you want, that works for me."
2,Disappointed,"The battery doesn't hold a charge very long, about two hours max. Initially I was alarmed but after talking to one of my tech friends he let me know that two hours is normal for this old technology. This is a replacement battery for a computer that's about eight years old. And so it is."
2,not great life for this product,This battery is only good for 2 hours max - my original was good for almost 4 hours. Looking for an OEM product - will keep this one as a backup but never buy from these guys again.
3,it works,"well it definitely fits...after cutting and shaving every little bit of extra plastic. I had to use my box knife to shave it away but hey, once that was done it did work correctly and yeah...it was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for and I would buy it again if I had to."
3,This was an okay book,"It took me a while to get into this book,simply because it jumped back and forth. After a while you get the hang of it and you get to enjoy it. I can't wait till ""baby momma drama"" comes out. I think this is the next title. You really have to feel for some of the men in this book. Because some men(in the book) are dogs, it cause others relationships to shatter. But in the end it all worked out for the better. I think men and women who have ""best friends, who comes before their women and men"" need to read this. It is real eye opener."
5,Can't stop reading it!,I haven't even finished this book yet and I know it's the BOMB! Two people told me to read it and I must say that it's the best book that I've read this year. This is my first from Carl Weber but it won't be my last.
4,Another Good One,Carl Weber describes the married life of four long time friends. Each very close yet so different from each other. He shows there can be highs and lows and everything in between in any relationship or friendship. It's a good book to read.
4,I'm not a reader.,"I'm not much of a reader so for me to be engulfed with this book was amazing to me and people that know me. Turn a book into a movie and I'll watch it instead of reading it. That said; I purchased this book solely on customer reviews. The customers were right. This book was a page turner. I could not put it down. This was the best ""movie"" I've ever read."
3,Hilarious!,"This book may not be a great literary masterpiece, but it is absolutely hilarious! Weber's character's are somewhat naive, yet they remain endearing as they wander through the trials of married life. If you're looking for a good laugh, this is the book for you."
5,Hurry up and write!,"After reading this book, all I could say is for Mr.Weber toplease hurry up and release his next book.This book was filledwith drama. I was unable to put it down and anxiously await thenext book which I am sure will be just as great."
5,Loved It!,This book made me feel like I was in a conversation with someone about event's that I'd witnessed. I felt like a fly on the wall of each of the main characters' lives. The endings are exactly what you hope for in each character's life.AWESOME!
4,"OK Story, But WAYTOO LONG",There are so many other reviews that I don't think I can say anything new. I just ditto the other 4 star reviews.
3,GOOD BOOK,This read was pretty entertaining. The only problem I had was that the story line was predictable.
5,well deserved praise....,"I've been a fan of Carl Weber's since I read ""Lookin' For Luv"" and ""Baby Mama Drama"". He describes his characters and their situations in such a way, that one can't help but be drawn into the story. After the first few pages, I'm always hooked.No matter what Carl Weber writes, you can best believe that I'll be buying it. I can't wait until the next book comes out to see what drama Carl Weber will draw me into next!"
5,Men are worst than women sometimes,I reall enjoyed this book. Rose was really crazy and she was everything they made her out to be. That was really funny what Allen did with her wedding ring. Overall each character fed off one another and I really felt the bond they had. Men can be as vain as women and gossip too but they each had one another back through everything. Diane kinda took things to the extreme but I'm glad Lisa made her realize her mistakes and get her husband back before it was too late. This was really a good read.
5,Wonderful Wonderful,"This book was wonderful, sort of predictable at the end, but still it was great reading material. Carl Webber is a great writer. If I began to talk about the book I might tell all the goodies. So I do recommend u go get."
4,Very Very Good book,This book was very entertaining. At first I was apprehensive about purchasing the book b/c I hadn't read anything by Weber and I was pleasantly surprised. Once you get into it you can't put it down. This book is highly recommended!!
5,Good Book,"It's been a couple years since I've read this book, but I still remember it, because it was that good. It kinda felt like I understood for one minute where a man was coming from. All the different situations were unique and the outcomes were even better."
4,Great for reading,This was a first time reading for me of Carl Weber. And it was a great book. It kept me reading and very interested. He is a great writer and I plan to read many more of his books. (SJ)
4,"Crazy, but I'm enjoying this book.","I'm a Carl Webber fan, i've read most of his books, and I have not been dissapointed. I like that he tells his stories in 1st person."
3,Men with problems!,"Talk about role reversal. This book sums it up. Just like how women have problems, men have them and sometimes even worse. There was some much drama and miscommunication going on that it didn't make any sense. But I'm glad to finally see someone write a book about male drama for a change. This was like lifetime network for men. 3 1/2 stars"
5,LEFT ME WANTING MORE!!!!,THIS BOOK WAS STRAIGHT UP OFF THE HOOK. THE CHARACTORS WERE NOT ONLY REAL BUT I FELT LIKE I NEW THEM PERSONALLY. MR. WEBER HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING INSIDE MY WINDOW CAUSE THIS IS MY LIFE. I CAN'T WAIT FOR BABY MOMMA DRAMA.
5,EXCELLENT,ANOTHER EXCELLENT BOOK; COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN; TOLD EVERYONE TO READ IT; A REAL PAGE TURNER; FINISHED IN 3 DAYS.
5,HE DID IT AGAIN!!!,"Carl Weber is so talented. This book was great. I can almost guarantee you will see some people you know in this book. It will keep you laughing, shock you at times, and just make so glad you spent the money to buy it. Keep up the good work, Mr. Weber. Can't wait for Baby Mama Drama!!!"
5,Married Couples!!!!,This is a great read for those married and single. Reading from the man's point of view was enlightening and it all comes together with the woman's view. This was well written and I couldn't put it down. It's funny but real AND it has lessons that we all could learn from.
5,WISH I COULD GIVE IT SIX STARS!,"This is the best book I've read all year! It has love, romance, betrayal, action everything!The characters were well developed, well thought out and CW hit a home run with the ending!The story is told from the perspective of 4 lifelong male friends all married, all dealing with marriage issues. The last few chapters are told from the wives perspectives. You would think it would get confusing, but it was just the opposite.This book was amazingly written and I am looking forward to more of CW's projects."
5,Bravo!,"Good work Mr Weber! This is even better then 'Looking for Luv'. I enjoyed the characters and their bond. Even though the situations got a little hazy, I enjoyed the plot and overall theme of the book. I anxiously await your next book and wish you the best success in this business. As for you readers, this is definately a pick up! It's long but it's worth it, an answer to an insomniac's prayer."
2,"small photos, poorly printed","while flipping through this book i kept getting this eerie three-ring binder feeling. something about this book feels cheesy and self-published, and its not just the chapter heading fonts. for one, being that this book is supposed to be about the photographs as well as the sory, i found the paper unsuitable for printing photos. as well, though there are quite a number, they are all small and poorly printed."
3,Good idea... biased book,"First, the Software Factories concept is great in some points while it combines model driven design and domain specific languages. If it is a real future for software development you have to read and take your conclusions.But..this book is too Microsoft biased. As written by a MSFT emplyee this is kind of expected but the fact is that the guy makes everything to say C#/.Net is the future of Java. This includes saying that JIT compilation was first introduced by .Net, that JavaBeans are a convention that are evolved in C# by delegates and properties and lots of other tries to make people believe that .Net is an evolution of the Java platform. I think this really compromises the book and would be much, much better if it just used C# and forgot all comparisson.I'd suggest that people intersted in MDA, DSL and new trends read this book but just skip all the Java bashing."
2,"Not bad, not good","This book is interesting but it is poorly organized. It seems that ideas are mixed, and chapters repeat the same ideas again and again, sometimes calling them in different way."
1,Cannot change button functions,"This a small optical mouse that unfortunately does not work in that the button functions are set and you can't change them. For example, whenever a dialog box opens with a default Yes or OK button, the mouse cursor automatically moves to that button. This is an option for an intellimouse, but the option can be turned off. The Targus website says that these options are not changeable. I personally cannot use a mouse that moves the cursor by itself - I've tried for two weeks and, while writing code, have had to do some rewrites.Otherwise, if you don't mind this functionality, it's a nice mouse. I'm returning this one."
4,some people are just crazy,"This book is about Fernande Olivier, Picasso's lover during his formative years as an artist. It's about a relationship based on control -- Picasso won't let Fernande have shoes so she won't be able to leave the house. This book is extremely interesting but you can't help being astonished by how naive and foolish Fernande is."
2,Cute but does not stay on the laptop,"This skin is padded which is nice when you write on a piece of paper on top of it. However it does not stay on the laptop at all. The edge lift when the laptop is closed. When the laptop is open, it slowly peels back starting from the top. The only way it stays is if you tape the edges with scotch tape which I have done. If you don't mind taping it down, it's alright. I gave it 2 stars for the looks and padding"
3,One to Love,"An interesting mix of rock, britpop, electronica, folk, shoegazing elements, dance and spoken-word, ""One Love"" is a worthwile debut from a promising band that not many have heard of. Delakota deliver a fresh and entertaining record, an easy one to like since it dares to be both catchy and experimental. There are some gripping songs here, like the upbeat single ""C'mon Cincinnati"", the slow yet peculiar ""The Rock"", the dynamic ""555"", the dark ""Metallic Blue"" or the noisy ""Brother"". Overall, this is a solid and appealing effort that deserves a listen.Recommended to those who like alternative-mainstream bands like Oasis, Primal Scream, Stone Roses or Radiohead."
3,Excellent CD,"I had this one when my son was a baby and wanted to get it for my newest baby. It is a great Christian lullaby CD. My only problem is that when I bought it I didn't realize what the seller sent me was a sampler of 4 songs, not the whole CD. I think it was a mistake and the seller didn't relize it wasn't all there. I would have given 5 stars to the whole CD."
3,Not Quite as Expected,"John Dunning is a wonderful author, and he did a huge amount of work in preparing this book. But I expected more detail in many instances than it provides. The preview offered by Amazon doesn't go into the entries about broadcasts, and I likely would not have bought the book if I'd seen how superficial some (not all) entries are."
5,Great reference for the OTR fan!,"A wealth of info for the OTR fan. I was looking at getting the physical book, but was surprised to find that it was available for the Kindle - it's quite a bit cheaper, and quick and easy to reference favorite shows. Wonderful!"
5,A must have for every OTR fan,"There's not much I can add to all the other reviews of Mr. Dunning's encyclopedia, this is simply an essential for every devotee of old time radio."
4,Epson A4 Size Self Adhesive Photo Paper,"Epson A4 Size Self Adhesive Photo Paper. Epson Self Adhesive Photo Paper, A4-Size, 10 sheets. Epson S041106Used this to cover an unwanted product logo with our school mascot photo on gifts to our football seniors. Worked very well"
3,Sticky,"The quality of the paper was less that desired, and you can see white on the edges if you use anything but an x-acto."
4,Easier on line,"The products are the same through out the country, why not buy on line and save gas and time. It's so much easier."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,The title of this review says it all. The case is made of poor quality materials. I was going to use it as a Christmas stocking stuffer but instead put it in the grandchildren's toy box with an old cell phone. They think it's great fun.
4,The Universal Flip Phone Case.,The Universal Flip Phone Case from GIZMOCO is working out fine it is all I expected it to be and I think this is a great.
2,This case is too short for LG VX8300,"The case is nice-looking, but it's a little short for the LG VX8300, such that the phone sticks out of the top. I'd go for the other flip-phone case with the white stitching. That ones a perfect fit."
1,Duped,"The product is about 2 inches by 3 inches, and too small today. It s fine. But it was advertised as fitting most flip phones. That may have been true ten years ago. Certainly not today."
4,Very Good,Product and vendor are very good. Got the item quickly and it met expectations. I'd use this vendor again.
5,Perfect Fit,"I use this with my model 410 LG flip phone and it is a perfect fit. The phone is approximately 3.5"" tall, 2"" wide and 6/8"" deep and it fits snugly into this case with no worry about it falling out under normal use. The clip is plenty strong and holds well, the case is very well made, and the price is right. Gizmoto had it shipped to me across country in two days, free shipping via USPS. I'd buy another in a second if I needed one."
5,Great product!,"I tried every store within miles of my home and was unable to find a case for my LG flip phone. Then I stumbled on this. It fits perfect, is well made, and had a great price!"
4,Nice flip phone case,"I've worn out previous flip phone cases, and decided to try Gizmoco's model. It fits small flip phones very well, including my LG flip phone from T-Mobile, and I'm pleased with it. The price was very good compared to retail stores, so I bought 2. Gimoco's delivery was quite prompt, also."
2,Microsoft MVP 2005 - Visual C# gives this a big thumbs down!,There are much better books out there. This one tries to cover way too many topics and doesn't cover any of them well. .NET developers need insight and depth in order to build great software. This book won't deliver either. 2-3 pages on Generics with nothing more than a few paragraphs regurgitating the docs on using a List? Please...There is nothing wrong with the author or the code samples. You just won't get anything above and beyond what you get for free with the MSDN documentation and code samples.
1,Missing the Important stuff,"A chronicle of the rise, fall, and rise again of the Bronx heavily focused on the citizens initiatives to fight housing, drug, etc issues; there must have been a hundred of them in intimate detail, almost to the point of boredom. I did not come away with a strong feeling of what the citizens lives were really like - the intimate details of how they lived and why - and I think that the author made little commentary on the effectiveness of the citizen and political solutions focused on versus other alternatives e.g. job growth rather than available safe housing. EASY READING, POOR AS A LEARNING TOOL"
1,not happy,"After I placed the order... got an email saying that they didn't carry it anymore... Then, why advertise it??? If you haven't got one to sell... don't advertise it and say you do!!!"
1,AVOID!!!!,"I have most of the M.ILL.ION cd's, and find them to be a very enjoyable hard rock band and looked forward to this dvd. I did not have high expectations as this is not a big band, but I have plenty of dvd's from lesser known bands that look like big production jobs compared to this!!First off, it seems the sound must have come right off the sound board, as you can actually hear the levels changing on the different instruments within a songs, quite drastically at times. So the sound is never good, and sounds quite dry. Also the video editing is horrible, but I could have lived with it were it not for the sound quality. It is only about 1 hour long and I had a hard time getting through it it was so bad!! Save your money!!!"
3,Railroadiana Galore!,"The author has an encyclopedic knowledge of the railroad systems and is clearly fascinated and passionate as regards them. The strong side of the text is its love of the railroad, the weaker side the near lack of historical or broader economic development or critique. The author makes light of the lack of many substantive documents as regards the business and yet there is often an overwhelming and whirring citation of byzantine purchases and ever expanding holding companies. Train specialists will be fascinated, but anyone looking for a wider or even more speculative book on the Van Sweringens or social history will not find it here. Nevertheless, to each his own!"
2,Chose Sony and paid a premium price just for a year of use.,"I am facing the same problem as Raviraj.It has been little over a year and my camcorder is corrupted. When I try to record, there is nothing but few scrambled lines.Tried head cleaning. Did not work. I could have bought a more affordable camcorder( other friends using Panasonic are quiet satisfied) if I was to replace it after merely using it for a year. I chose Sony thinking it might last long because of good name brand."
1,camera died in less than 2 years,"I purchased the sony trv33 less than 2 years ago, i used it gently & took VERY good care of it.In July 2005 the camera died for no reason. It will not record video, the LCD and viewfinder are ""black"".Sony wants to charge $270 plus shipping to fix.I've been doing research and found many, MANY other people with the same problem, and not just with the TRV33 model, other sony models are doing the exact same thing.I used to love SONY products and was very faithful to the brand until now."
1,was nice while it lasted,"After 18 months of very light use, the camera died, showing only a black screen. Sony wants $270 to fix it. Apparently this problem is common across many different Sony camcorder models. My advice to anyone thinking of buying a camcorder is to avoid Sony."
1,very bad experience,"very very bad experience with this camera. i bought it looking at sony's big brand name. but i realized the mistake now. this product ran okay during the 1 year which was warranty period. one day for no reason (i have a coushon bag to keep this camera, any jerk is out of question), there was no display on camera. when i got it checked, the CCD was gone and cost to get it replaced was half the price of camera.I am going to throw it off in dumpster. will think thousand times buying sony products... they are just costly, but not worth to work just one year."
1,don't waste money on a camera that only lasts 1.5 years,"I got EXACTLY the same problem as many of other victims had experienced. All of sudden, after very scarce and gentle use, the camera only showed verticle lines and went completely blind.What is the good of a camcord if it can't even last more than 1.5 years with less than 10 hours of recording?I would say that SONY is KNOWINGLY selling defective products to consumers and all of us who had problems should file class-action law suit against SONY for damages.Any lawyers who are reading this should seriously consider this. You may reap big dollars while helping us to vent some anger."
1,worst than VHS_C,"I WANTED TO UPGRADE FROM MY PANASONIC VHS-C CAMCORDER TO SOMETHING DIGITAL SO AFTER READING ENDLESS REVIEWS I CHOSE THIS SONY TRV33, BIG MISTAKE. I BELEIVE SONY INTENTIONALLY MADE THESE MINI DV CAMCORDERS WITH AN INTENT ON FORCING PEOPLE TO BUY THE ENDLESS (EXPENSIVE) ACCESSORIES. AFTER OWNING MY VHS-C FOR YEARS I TOOK ALOT FOR GRANTED LIKE A BUILT-IN LIGHT, TRUE REAL LIFE COLOR, A LENSE THAT SHOWS THE SIZE OF A .7 WIDE ANGLE WITHOUT DISTORTION, SP LP EP(6HRS), WORKS WELL WITH REGULAR INDOOR LIGHTING, ALL AND MORE OF THE AFFORMENTIONED REQUIRE ACCESSORIES ON THIS MINI DV CAMCORDER. I ADJUSTED, WORKED ALL CONTROLS, READ THE MANUAL AN STILL DIDN'T GET WHAT I'VE BEEN USE TO WITH MY VHS-C."
4,Strange Motor sound on camera and vcr mode,"This sure is a great camcorder with a sleek body and Awesome touch screen. The video quality is excellent. The size, look, weight, capability of taking good quality still pictures, and ease of navigation makes this camera a great buy. However, there is a strange motor noise in the CAMERA and VCR mode after you insert a mini DV video tape is really annoying. Despite of its great feature, I am planning to return it and wait till Sony fix this prob, because I think its way better than Panasonic in the similar price rangeIf you don't care about the noise, then go for it."
1,Camera stopped working after a year of use,"It's a nice camcorder. Took plenty of pictures of my young daughter. However after 13 months of usage, the camcorder stopped recording; all I see is a fuzzy image on the screen. I can playback my recorded cassettes, but otherwise it has become useless.Called up Sony, and Cust service is asking for $270 + shipping + tax to fix it. Ironically, they mention that nobody has faced a similar problem, but a quick search on Google will yield plenty of consumers complaining the same problem.It has good price (expensive than similar camcorders by other manufacturers), but I would strongly recommend buying an extended warranty plan. I am looking out for another camcorder, if there's any good camcorder, please suggest it to me.ThanksJignesh"
2,Self destruct wasn't listed as a feature,8 months after I bought this camera it lost the ability record video. In fact the screen is black. I can still use the menus and watch old videos but somehow I am looking for a camera than can take pictures. Most camera should be expected to break the 8 month mark with out breaking especially with out outside help.
3,Very Loud Annoying Buzzing Noise,"I have just purchased a unit last March 28, 2003 but decided to return it back because of this very loud annoying buzzing noise that somewhat emanates I suspect from the motor that controls while on VCR and CAMERA mode. I have gone to other stores and tried/tested other units of the same model and as well a model of this line that has less options and found that it too possesses the same problem as I may call it, ""Very Loud Annoying Buzzing Noise"". I love the features that this particular camcorder offers but decided otherwise because of this noise but if you decided to purchase one, please do try and post your findings around here. I hope Sony relizes and find a fix to this if indeed this is a problem because for me as a consumer it ""BUZZING SOUNDS"" surely is. I have an older Sony camcorder but this one is smooth and no noise at all."
3,Forget about still image quality,"Bought this camera thinking I would be replacing my digital still with a double-duty camera. 1 megapixel photos are sufficient for my purposes (1000-1500 photos per event ftp'd to a server), as long as lens and processor are quality. Don't think you're getting that here. I take close-up shots for auctions and the lack of a macro mode for these shots makes the images very grainy and dark. I can't comment on the video capabilities, but I'm taking this camera back to Circuit City and going back to a digital still :-( In my opinion, if the still image capability is going to be a feature on a digital video camera, the quality should at least be comparable to a digital still camera of the same megapixel rating."
4,It is a good Comcorder.,"I have this comcorder about 2 weeks. I will say that it is a good Comcorder indeed.However, I found two prolems come with this comcorder. First, there is a little bit noise. Second, there is no A/V IN function that I could not record program from TV."
3,Motor noise,"It is a good Camera, have a lot of cool stuff. Touch screen is easy to operate. Still images shoot in memery card are very poor. Don't bother to use it. Fixture very much the same as DCR TRV22, why pay more for DCR TRV33? Both use the same menue book."
4,"A worry about Section 1, Puzzle 59","A nice challenge but I believe that the given solution is not unique.....I've found another! Hence I have gone off on a wild goose chase, eventually ending up at a previously solved problem....I would love to believe I am wrong, but can't believe I am!Still, a good challenge!"
4,A classic,"Not just any book of owls, but THE Book of Owls! I am enjoying the antique-looking black and white photos. This is my bible. Sort of. I love those fierce eyes. Defend your nests owls! Uphold your societies!"
2,my order,"Not made very well,hard to assemble the fits don't go to gether well enough.heads of the screws are to small for the amount of toruqe needed to tighten"
1,The Cosmo of Fishing Mags,"If you want to read about Oprah's first cast, Jimmy Carter's secrets or Obama's first fish, this is the magazine for you. If you are looking for more then 5 pages of fly fishing substance, look elsewhere. I've subscribed to this magazine the past two years as well as a few others. This is consistently the poorest of the group. Short columns and poor articles make this a disappointing magazine."
2,Disappointing,"very simple writing, immature dialog, shallow plot with unrealistic turns. I'm glad I finally finished it."
2,Eh,"I had high hopes for this book after reading the book jacket, but was disappointed. It was predictable, a bit cheezy and obvious at times and would have made a better lifetime movie than a novel."
1,Like Reading a Basal Reader for Second Graders,"The plot is fine: a bunch of people don't like abortions. And they set out to rid themselves of the doctor who performs them. And in the hands of a skilled writer, this could have been a fascinating book. But Elizabeth Brundage would do well to work for a basal reader outfit: Annie had a desire for grapes. She put one in her mouth. She thought about her new lover. Annie knew he must be thinking about her. No, that isn't from the novel, but that is the degree to which the author has writing skills. The syntax, on the whole, is very synethic.Then there are the absolutely ridiculous characters who seem straight out of a telenovela. Every character in this novel is one-dimensional. And the dialogue is often so contrived.If this author publishes something else, I will not be reading it."
2,Just ok,"I thought the diaglogue was pretty phony. Real people usually don't talk that way, even if they are professors and doctors. The writer also has an obvious agenda, and I think that fact distracted from the book. Overall, it was readable but not great."
1,The Doctor's Wife,"I want my money back.What a tiresome book.I struggled and I cant remember when I have read anything so trite.Needless to say I was surprised that one of the chapters didnt start out ""It was a dark and stormy night...""I always finish every single book I start but to be honest with you I almost had to break that rule with this juvenile blather.Thing is I like reading new authors. You can find some truly gifted people who are unknown. But not this time.To sum it up. Bad guys are rich Republicans. I'm sure you can take the rest of the manufactored drivel and create the ......rest of the story. HA!Hope this author doesnt give up her day job. Or, if her day job is writing might I suggest Burger King is now hiring."
1,Disgusting.,"This is the first time I have ever reviewed a book on Amazon, but this book was SO incredibly awful that I just had to get my two cents in. I will admit the beginning is great. It grabs you and sucks you right in. The beginning, though, is as good as it is going to get. This book is disgusting and sleazy. The foul language is rampant and completely unnecessary. PLEASE do not waste your money on this book. My copy is in the trash, because that is exactly what this book is... a piece of trash. If I could give it a negative rating, I would."
3,good but...,"I mostly liked this book but as I got closer to the end, I liked all the characters less and less so thereby not really giving a hoot what happens! Lydia Haas was off her rocker and her self-indulging husband, Simon, was a creep. I guess Annie was attracted to the ""bad boy"" in him as her husband, Michael, was too straight for her as she approached her middle years. Michael was also self absorbed. Of course, to be as good a doctor as he is/was depends a bit on that quality. But Lydia's ending in the story seems forced with Simon paying more than his share of the cost of two messed up lives. Annie's thoughts regarding her husbands abilities or lack of in bed make for the ending to be unrealistic. Sure, she loved him in a way but was no longer attracted to him so really, in the end, they should have got their separate ways. But it was okay."
2,"Good Start, Bad Ending","I really cannot believe that this is the finished product. While I was initially compelled by the development of the characters and how they were to be involved with one another, I found the events to be formulaic and lacking orginality, the symbolism childish, and the final climax completely ridiculous in its everything-and-everyone-falls-into-place finish. This was a good first draft, but for it to be edited and published? I'm flatly surprised. I'd like to read it reworked and tweaked."
5,Excellent Political Thriller,"There is nothing more interesting than when a writer takes on a subject that nobody wants to talk about. Michael Chrighton did it with Disclosure, among others, and this book deals with the subject of abortion, which seems to bring out the worst in many people, especially the ones who don't believe in it. It's not an easy subject to write about because this country has become divided and you are either on one side or the other. The author here tries to show what things look like on the ground floor, from both the doctor's point of view and the evangelical minister's. The book focuses on a young couple who, when faced with certain choices, sometimes makes the wrong ones. Their lives become embroiled in conflict, and I was up all night trying to find out if they were going to make it through. It's not an easy read, but this is not a simple problem. Just to let you know, the minute I finished it, I made a contribution to NARAL."
4,on the noir side,"The Doctor's Wife is a thriller with complex human entanglements. I was genuinely tense, even fearful, as the relationships among characters tangled and took hold. From the first chapter, this book was difficult to put down, but the climax and resolution were too cinematic (noir) for my taste."
4,Easy and Quick Read,"This was a very quick and easy read. I read it while flying across country and back this week. Ms. Brundage takes on some controversial topics including religion, depression, infidelity, and abortion. No matter your feelings on these issues, I think it makes a great read. Yes, it does have a predictable ending. Hard to put down, all the same."
2,Predictable and cliche...,"When I finished this book - which I had to force myself to do - I felt like I had just finished watching an overplayed Lifetime movie. The plot was incredibly predictable. The characters were underdeveloped, so there was no hope of liking or feeling sympathy for any of them. Even the physical descriptions seemed contradicting; I couldn't decide if Simon was supposed to be handsome and suave or dirty and creepy. Some of the descriptions and phrases were so overly cliche that I had to roll my eyes. The dialogue was forced and mechanical. All of the conservative, religious and/or pro-life characters in the book were depicted as closed-minded, condescending, and sometimes murderous lunatics. Some of the narratives were clearly rants about religion, conservatism, pro-life thinking, and self-control. Overall, this book was unfulfilling and frustrating. If you're looking for a good, thoughtful read, I would avoid this."
3,Pretty good,"What was right: good writing, interesting insight into the emotional unraveling of a character, a blend of issues, an avoidance of the cliche of the doctor straying with a nurse, and a believable attraction between two adults.What was wrong: the abortion issue was extremely white and black, the story would have been more compelling told linearly, the title is slightly misleading (why not Annie, who had her own identity and didn't need to be labeled as wife, or The Artist's Wife, as she didn't have her own identity), and the Michael character was not developed enough.It's pretty good. Not bad for an new author."
2,The Book Sure Has A Lot of Words.,"At first the book was interesting. Then I found my mind wandering, so I tried again later. I read till the last half, and got so bogged down I decided to speed read the rest. I read the last few pages to see how it ended, and that was that. I didn't like much about this book-- the characters, the way anti-abortionists are portrayed (of course, they are all bad), and I thought the conversation with the 6 year old girl about abortion was totally unnecessary. What 6 year old girl can understand a subject that serious? I just didn't give a flip about any of the characters. None of them had any redeeming qualities, so I didn't want to waste any more of my time."
1,Glad I didn't buy it!,"A friend gave me this book to read. It took me 4 weeks to finish it. It just didn't compel me to keep reading. The characters just weren't that interesting and the story line dragged on. Reminded me of Fatal Attraction, only the wife of the adulterous husband was the crazy one! Think I'll stick with my paranormal stuff!"
1,Sloppy Editing,"Living in Albany, I settled down for a good read set in and near Albany NY. None of the characters were likeable, but the thing that made the book the most disjointed for me was reading things like, ""He turned out of South Pearl Street, onto Delaware Avenue heading toward the expressway"" or something like that. South Pearl is nowhere near Delaware Avenue. Anyone heard of Googlemap? There were quite a few scenes like that, that brought me up short and took me out of the rhythm of the writing. Something as simple as a map of Albany might have helped."
1,Not Worth It,"I am glad that I only borrowed this book. Like many readers, I could not sympathize with any of the characters. By the end of the book, the character I hated the least, Simon, was the character that I think the author intended for the reader to despise the most. Annie, the doctor's wife was selfish, the doctor was a dunce, and Lydia was just plain crazy. To be honest, I was hoping that all of the main characters would die at the end of the book, that is how obnoxious I found them. Plus, the author was too strong with her pro-abortion agenda."
2,Semi boring book with political agenda,"I, unfortunately, put this book down after the first half. As a policy, I always continue a book to the middle, regardless of whether I am enjoying it or not. I did not enjoy this book. I found it rather boring. I am guessing because of the format in which it was written. I also did not appreciate the political agenda of the book. I actually am pro choice, but I like my books to not include politics. I read to escape from those things :)"
3,Psychological suspense-a good read!,"The cover of the book drew me into the world of these conflicted people...educated, uneducated, liberal, conservative, seemingly normal, dillusional...the author wove an interesting story and I wasn't sure the final outcome. The characters' lives were irrevocably woven together and there didn't seem to be a happy conclusion for any of them. Life has a way of doing just that...sometimes there are no true winners. If you like psychological suspense, give this a try."
3,Heavy Read,"Living in Wichita, KS. allows me to relate to the harassment and lunatics that abortion doctors endure. I am not saying I agree with abortion, quite the contrary, but I absolutely do NOT believe in killing or harassing someone who does. There are religious groups that do act as though they are the judge and jury and their actions, ""In the name of Jesus Christ"" appall me. Some reviewers feel that this representation in the book is far fetched, believe me it is not.The Doctor's Wife is a very heavy, disturbing but thought provoking novel. It is a very well written book with suspense and the ever prevalent ""one bad choice after another"", and would make for great for a book club discussion due to the various subject matters.I was really excited to read this book but just didn't love it. I think it was just due to the heavy subject matter and the lack of connection with the characters.If you are looking for a happy read, this is not it!"
5,Great start for this new author!,"This book was wonderful! It held my attention right until the very last page. She does a great job of telling a story, and getting you into the mind of her characters."
1,Don't let the great beginning fool you. It has little to do with the real story or quality of writing.,"The beginning of this book had me captivated. Wow, I thought, I'm going to love this. It was gripping, moved along fast, so deliciously descriptive it made you cringe with the realisam. But then it started to slow down, then got sluggish, then crawled, then became laborious, then pratically came to a dead stop. I made it to the middle and threw it down in disgust. How can anyone write such a compelling beginning and then drift into such boring drivel? The rest of the book is so different as to have been written by a differenty author. Hash words but true. The farther I got, the worse it got. I hate to think of someone reading the first chapter and buying the book based on the great beginning. You're gonna be disappointed. This is actually a dreary, tedious relationship book about some really annoying people. Who knows how it ends. I couldn't suffer that long."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"This book definitely defines a page turner! It is suspenseful, interesting, and well written. It is also an added plus if you are from or are familiar with the Albany area because you will be able to recognize pretty much everything, which makes it all the better!"
2,Made-for-TV-movie written all over it!,"Any reviewers with favorable comments about this book are just being kind and not truthful. Brundage poorly develops her characters and you are left not caring what happens to a single one of them. And we have every conceivable attention-grabber thrown into the mix - sex, drugs, abortion, religious cults, adultery, suburban boredom - Brundage must have feared that if she didn't throw in something for every taste some readers wouldn't finish her book. The result is so over-the-top that the ""cataclysmic intersection of...lives"" described on the back cover becomes an absolute train wreck for the novel as a whole. And the culminating scene in the farmhouse is so anticlimatic and predictable and poorly written, it was like watching a bad for-TV-movie. I live in the locale that is the setting for the book and can't even take satisfaction in that. Sorry, even cutting the author some slack for it being a debut novel, it is a total waste of time."
4,Intresting...,"This book was crazy... I picked it up at Wal Mart, but didnt catch the part in the front that says Psychological thriller. Not my normal type of reading, but I started reading it anyways. It took me some time to get thorugh it, only because I didnt have time to sit down and read it all at once. It was a very well written book, sometimes slight confusing, and sometimes she just went on to much about things, when she could have just moved on. But it was defninelty a good book, and very memorible. A great debute."
3,The Doctor's Wife,It certainly kept my attention and I wasn't bored but I really wasn't moved by the substance. I thought the ending was good but I had a hard time equating it with real life. I can only say that I have read a lot better but I did finish it.
2,Nothing original,"I found not too much original in this book. While there were several themes with intriguing possiblities, (abortion, mental illness) the author never really fleshes them out, but rather depends on cliches and one dimensional portrayals - all anti-abortionists are religious zealots, all sexually abused children turn out to be murderers, etc. The become simply a backdrop for soap-opera or romance novel theatrics. I also found Michael's ambiguity regarding the safety of his family totally unrealistic.I would not recommend spending your time on this novel."
1,Just a tease with no please!!,"The teaser for the book was just that. A big tease. The ingredients were all there, they all sounded tasty, but when all mixed together the book was as diappointing as a fallen souffle.Everything was one dimensional as if the author didn't have enough umph to push the characters and plot from mediocre to interesting."
4,Gotta Have My Suspense,"I absolutely loved this book, and found myself unable to put it down. It doesn't do a marvelous job of helping the reader relate to and personify the characters. All of them lacked some measure of development. However I found the little plot twists at every corner and the conclusion a bit thrilling. Brundage does a good job of opening up the human psyche and building suspense all the while."
3,"Interesting Story, Characters are lacking","I agree with the other reviewers. This is an interesting story and could have developed into a thrilling novel. However, the lack of depth to the characters left me disappointed."
1,Doesn't fit any carts!,I've tried to use this cart cover at Target and at a few grocery stores - it's awkward and doesn't fit any seats properly. I just gave up and bought an Eddie Bauer model - hoping for better luck there.
2,didnt do the job,I don't want my kids touching any part of shopping carts and therefore was looking for 100% coverage. This doesn't provide it.
1,Save your money,"I received this at my baby shower, and loved it at first, because it's bright and colorful and has cute toys. However, like the other reviewers have said,1) It's hard to put on. It requires hooking the velcro straps together in order to secure it onto the cart, and my baby is screaming and wiggling long before I can get it on.2) It doesn't cover the whole cart. My baby loves to mouth the whole handle bar, and you can see even in the picture, that this cover doesn't reach the corners.One more thing . . .3) The toys hang down the front of the cart on the outside. Once my baby is seatbelted into the cart, she can't reach them!The only thing this is useful for are small restaurant high chairs, where hopefully other people can distract/hold your baby while you attach it AND to play with in the car on baby's lap, (while sitting in a car seat).Infantino Cart Safari w/Microban"
1,Stopped working after third tape!,"Was very pleased with the Sony TRV 38 until I got to about the middle of the 3rd tape. I had not used it in over 6 months and the next time I went to use it the recording screen and viewfinder was dark with a few gray streaks in it. It seems to play back o.k. On researching this problem I was staggered to find so many similar complaints. This is my first Sony (and it will be the last) I had a Panasonic for 8 years before this and it is still working. I have never abused this camera, never been to a beach with it, never used it in the rain etc. In fact it still looks like brand new!"
1,Buy it if you want but it might stop working in 1 year,"I bought this product last year. It has stopped recording video. I can't see anything in the viewfinder or screen. Absolutely nothing.On the flip side, it did work nicely for the year when it was working though.Just in case, you think I am disgruntled, cynical and I am writing this out of spite, please follow this link. There are many like us.http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7594-0.html?forumID=59&threadID;=53316&messageID;=635769In fact, people there have filed a class action suit against Sony on this issue.Overall, buy it if you want to. But see you on the forum above in 1 year."
4,Great camera for great price,"The picture quality on the Sony DCRTRV38 is the best out of any of the 10 comparable cameras we tested... We bought one of them several years ago, and like it enough to buy a second. It's ability to capture sound is also superior to any other camera in its class (we film a lot of live theatre, and we have perfect sound even from the last row in a non-mic'd show). The only cons are that we've had to have 2 repairs over the last 5 years, and the bottom-loading is inconvenient when using a tripod."
1,Known Defect in Sony CCD Assembly,"BEWARE of the Sony Camcorder products. I have a TRV 38 and, like many, many other people, the picture (LCD/CCD connection) went dead just after the warranty period. Do a google search on this issue and read the video forums to see the enormous problem that Sony has with these camers. There is talk of a consumer class action against Sony on this issue since it affects several of their models and they have refused to deal honorably with the problem. I will say that when it worked the camera was just great, perfect picture and easy to use. Avoid the heartbreak of finding a dead camera on your child's first birthday, as I did, and buy something else."
4,"Nice Sub-$1000 camera, but not perfect for perfection....","As a newbie video enthusiast, I'm really pleased with the TRV38. For under $1000, you get a great camera with a bunch of features. I just bought mine, so I'm still playing around with it to see what it can do. From what I can tell, the image quality is pretty good indoors, but when you get into lower light levels (like a dim room) the image seems to turn a little on the gray side. Out of the box, the camera feels good in the hand with most of the essentials at your fingertips. There are two features I'm not too fond of with the TRV38. One is the bottom-loading tape. If you're using a tripod, changing tapes can be annoying. The other item is the touch screen. It seems durable enough right now, but how will it stand up over time? it would be nice if there was a stylist (like a PDA) to help reduce the wear grubby fingers can have on the screen. Other than those two things, I'm really happy with the camera"
2,Unrealistic,"I started reading this yesterday, got halfway through, then skipped to the end. I appreciate the author's desire to write from a Christian perspective; however,in my experience Christian novels mostly come across as naive: the characters are uninteresting and predictable; the plots contrived. The Christian message is often thrown in awkwardly, as though the author feels compelled to ""witness"" even at the expense of the smooth flow of the story. And that's what happened here."
5,good book,I have injoyed reading this book and the whole set of books. I would recamend this book to others.thanks for the great storyfor us to injoy
2,River's Edge (Cape Refuge No. 3),"By the third book in the series, which was actually the same book, same characters, same plot, same very predictable outcome, I was getting quite bored with the u;nlikely scenario. I read it because we were in a situation where it was read this book or sit and look out the window waiting for someone to come along to deliver furniture."
4,New Queen of Suspense??,Well part 3 to this series was just as awesome as part one. I think it is better than part 2. The only problem I have with any of the books in this series is that I feel I was tricked into reading them. Part one and 2 were kindle freebies then you had to buy part 3 and 4. I will be honest I buy very few books for my kindle because of the price hike that occured right after I purchased my kindle. I would say this is a great series of books and mild enough for teh wholel to read them.
5,Another great work by Terri Blackstock,"""River's Edge,"" the third entry in the four-volume ""Cape Refuge"" series by Terri Blackstock, is yet another example that this unique author somehow continues to improve with each book. This is especially impressive considering that all of Ms. Blackstock's novels are outstanding. Her superb writing style; her creative plots of mystery, and compelling insight into human relations; her ability to integrate, so skillfully, her strong convictions in the Christian faith... all of these attributes, and more, make her works special. Very special. --RON HOWE (a.k.a. Toby Martin II)"
3,Didnt work for broken plastic fan blade,"lasted about 1/2 hour on low speed, then fan blade flew off. if someone knows what will work for a plastic fan blade, please comment."
1,FRAUD,"I purchased this product to repair a rearview mirror which had dislodged from a windshield. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT for the reason mentioned above. It will not work.Someone may feel compelled to defend this product. They may state that it was not used properly; or for some unseen reason, it was not used under the correct conditions.Any person or company who states this product can be used for rear view mirror anchorage should be subject to a drug test, and possibly neutered."
5,A great alternative adhesive for vehicle rearview mirrors,"I purchased this adhesive specifically as an alternative to those single-use rearview mirror adhesive kits that I have found unreliable in the past year. I agree with other reviews here that have found this adhesive effective for use on vehicle rearview mirrors. Over six months later the rearview mirror is still in place on my vehicle that sits outside and is exposed to the dramatic temperature swings between night and full sun of the day. Additionally, I can use this product more than once and for other things.I highly recommend this as an alternative to overpriced single-use rearview mirror adhesive kits."
1,Does not harden,"I've tried using the product several times, mixing equal parts of the solutions, more of the left and more of the right and regardless of combination, I cannot get the product to dry. Several days later the product is still sticky and tacky to the touch. The idea of it being clear was nice in case there was any bleed out of the edges but the fact that the two pieces weren't ever held in place made that convenience moot."
5,Works great,"A little unruly to put together, use, and store but definitely a solid product that does what it says. word"
4,This is one of two Epoxy brands I have purchased.,I used Permatex brand Epoxy mostly before and experimented with Gorilla Epoxy brand. You can tell the difference between quality and ease of use. But I would only purchase Gorilla Epoxy for smaller and more specialized projects. For the bulk of work on more generic projects with a lower budget I will continue to use Permatex since they do balance Quality and Price better.
2,Terrible Tape,This is definitely not one of the best Mr Bean tapes. It basicly consists of some everyday situations to which Mr Atkinson's sketches do not really succeed to add a little spice. Avoidable without consequences.
2,Voice Not Meant For Solo,"I am a big fan of 4HIM. I last saw them on a cruise in 2005 and they announced then that they would be heading off into solo careers.When my wife and I first heard FIND YOUR WINGS, we were touched by the great lyrics and thought of our daughter. However, after hearing a few more songs, we became annoyed with his voice after a while. He doesn't seem to have much range and without the others from 4HIM blending in as they often did so well, you can easily get tired of his voice.That isn't to put a damper on the quality of the lyrics and music, but I feel that the 4HIM guys will always sound better together than as soloists."
1,junk,"Second time we used this the sweeper stopped turning. We had to dissemble each wheel and remove grease that was built up inside the gear that stopped the little square pawl pin from free floating.Again today 4 th time using we are having to do the same thing. I cant believe a tiny square pin is all that is turning the sweeper brush and it is at the mercy of all the grease needed to keep the gear lubed. NOT good design at all !!!The assembly wasnt all that great either, missing parts because the bolts were all over the box due to the bag breaking in shipping, had to call and get more parts to replace the ones that are probably at UPS. MADE IN CHINA CRAP.UPDATE: Less than a year later 6 uses, husband trying in vane to rig the wheels so the sweeper turns..... TRASHING IT. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND EFFORT.THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE ASHAMED."
4,sw38pre,This is a good little sweeper. I sometimes have to go over wet grass twice but that is understandable. I am pleased with the product and put together was pretty easy.
1,Piece of junk!,"Got this sweeper after my good old (25yrs) Sears 38"" just wore out..finally.This product is a nightmare to put together!Very poor instruction sheeet!!You have to find screws and nuts all over the box(ended up one screw short)like above reviewer..1/1/2 hours to put together!! I cant figure for the life of me how this stuipid dump feature works,so I removethe entire bag to dump..then the bag got ripped the second time on a tab welded to the frame..The only good news was the price $169 shipped to Ct.Trust me dont pay any more cause it aint worth half that!And due to the cheap materials I can expect who knows how much use from it..My advise? Buy another kind!!Update 11/18/2011..After using this (sweeper) ten times the right wheel fell off!Cant find the snap ring to put it back on!What happened to cotter pins and washers?STAY AWAY!"
3,Lawn sweeper,"Lawn sweeper does a pretty good job. Sometimes not easy to find the right adjustment so that it will pick up leaves efficiently. The dumping rope is useless, easier to just unattach the shoot an dump it. Never tried it with just grass clippings. Never had to."
3,tech-types beware,Although I found this book quite well written I can't say that it provided any information to me that I didn't already have. I do have a degree in electronics and have spent a considerable number of years working with home studio equipment but I still felt that Craig's book could have put more detail into each of the chapters. The book is more of a basic tutorial designed for those new to recording who need a jumpstart down the path to audio competence. At this task it is very successful.
1,This book for the most part useless,"I purchased this book hoping to get some help setting up and making music in my little project studio. I have a Cubase SX setup, and wanted to lat down some tracks of some original tunes I have written. The book has an array of technical details, none of which help a beginner (or experienced person) for that matter set up a studio and make good recordings. If you want to learn ohm's law, and other electronic nomenclature, this book might be of use although a good electronics dictionary would be your best bet. For learning the basics of home recording, there are much better books and info out there. Pass this one by."
4,Not overly technical but still a good read,This book gave me some nice ideas on how to raise the standard of the quality of my recordings. I was very focused on music in my younger days but accepted that I cant earn a good living doing it. I still like to dabble though. I wish i had found this book years earlier.
3,The Monster Behind the Smile,"Although it's not a perfect book, An Almost Perfect Murder presents the details of the case for those of us who couldn't attend the trial. I met Michael Franklin after his wife's death, and he told a very sad story about being a widower with a young child. Much like O.J. Simpson, Franklin was handsome, muscular, and charismatic. But this book shows his other side, which was manipulative, crafty and sociopathic. His eroding relationship with Ronna's family and her brother, in particular, is a particulary telling plotline. The book presents a compelling picture of an extremely self-centered man who deceived many as he meticulously plotted his wife's murder and his subsequent cover-up."
3,Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings,"I was under the impression that Bill would be doing the singing on a lot of these but he was standing back like he did with the Rolling Stones. Not a true ""Bill"" CD as far as I am concerned"
5,Enhances the sound from an intermediate horn,"On the recommendation of my son's band instructor, we purchased this larger 5C mouthpiece. The reinforced cup has the effect of enhancing the sound from my sons older intermediate trumpet."
2,"Over all to soon, but cute","This book (aside from being irreverent) provides a few smiles, but is quite short."
2,"Very Short, Nothing Hillarious Here but if Cheap or in Your Local Library Give it a Look","Andy Riley certainly isn't in the high quality non children aimed cartoon leagues of say Gary Larson (The Far Side) but this book will certainly releive the boredom, albeit only for ten minutes or so as there are not that many cartoons inside here.It is very unlikely you would find kids stupid enough to beleive any of these lies within but I don't think they're meant to. The book is what it is, basic cartoons telling far fetched stories to tell kids or gullible adults."
1,Worthless,"This book was a complete and utter disappoint, not only to myself, but to every one of my coworkers who have picked it up. Each of them has asked me, ""Did you REALLY pay money for this?""Anyone intelligent enough to understand any of these lies will undoubtedly be too intelligent to ever believe them. The biggest lie: the title.Unintelligent, uneducational, unentertaining, and simply uninteresting, this book is of no value. The sequel is no better."
5,Excellent toner,This toner is excellent. Does not dry my skin and the pump makes the toner extremely easy to apply. The push pump allows you to control the amount you wish to use. Nice scent too.
1,Battery DOA (Dead On Arrival),"I loved the look of the watch when it arrived and I opened the box. But my excitement turned to anguish when I realized the battery didn't work?!?!? No exchange, ""Refund Only"" policy hurts. If I want to buy a replacement it will cost me $58 MORE than my original purchase. That is JUST WRONG!!!"
4,Nice but too big,"If you want everybody see your watch, and say wow! , this is a good choose for you, but if you don't like be shine, select a smaller one. I think this is a good watch for a not formal but a casual dress."
2,Fair craftmanship and a reasonable time-keeper,"This watch does not have an expensive feel to the pushers and the movement does not have an exacting appearance. It has a less expensive dispostion about it. But, it is a less expensive timepiece. For the money it is a great purchase. The only real dislike is that some of the chrono hands are brushed metalic and it almost looks like foil - sort of cheese looking. To have held the watch in my own hand, I probably would not have purchased it. However, the band was exceptional in fine leather."
2,"Improved picture, but lost sound","Produced a better picture from my DVD player, but after 30 days the sound went (?). TV's sound is fine on it's own, and DVD works fine with composite cables, sound and picture. So it has to be the cable. I don't know if this happens to cables, but I e-mailed the seller asking and have thus far received no reply. I bought it because it was offered on Amazon, whom I trust, and the price was great ($5.95 + S&H). But I guess you get what you pay for!"
1,A huge rip off,"Monster Cables are the biggest scam in all of consumer rip offs.They do absolutely nothing as far as picture quality is concerned, and they cost a heck of a lot more than the cheap ones..."
2,Monster Cable,"I dont like monster cable,forgive me in saying if you just have avcr, or dvd connecting to your tv and go with monsters highestgrade cable thats ok.another thing with monster cables i dont like is, you push your monster cable on the back of your dvd player,and it is locked on you some times just about have to usechannel lock plyers to get them off.now monster might say that this is a locking cable nothing do it. but any ways if you havebought monster and dont like the locking on the cable,you can take a 30 carbine shell that has been fired (meaning no bullet)and spread the interconnects on both sides then you can get themcables off with out messing up your dvd.now someone was talkingabout (TRIBUTARIES CABLE) you can buy tributaries cheaper thanmonster,you buy stright from factory and it can be costly.find dealer that buys cable from tributaries and makes the cableany size you want.look on the auction sites.i also like (D H LABS) and you can buy the cable off them, and build yourself."
3,What's all the fuss about?,"Now and then I try a Monster product just to see if they've improved or reverted back to their higher quality of 15 or so years ago. This s-video (all Monster s-video cables have the same 30-ohm internal wire, regardless of price, and are not 75-ohm NTSC standard) makes a cheap tv with image brown-out look a little juicier -- but on better tv's the image is too red, skin tones are off, grays are muddy, blacks are blocked up and below valid YUV levels, skin tones and shadows bristle with cyan blotches. Not too bad on a good CRT tv but looks dreadful on LCD's, none of which have accurate color to begin with. All colors thru this wire have an unrealistic candy-cane look. If this is your preference, by all means spend your $$$. AR-ProII and Belden make much better s-video wire. Be careful with Monster's plugs: the pins break easily, and the fit is way too tight."
1,DEFECTIVE,We returned this unit for a full refund. It had an open circuit on the shielding conductor. Clearly Monster has a hell of a QC problem if they missed that.
5,A great strategy guide,"I am always shocked by people trying to invest abroad without understanding the countries they're investing in. This book makes it clear you can't do that and be successful. A lot of portfolio strategy is about getting it right at the macro level, and this book is dead on in its profiles of top emerging market economies and how they work."
2,Not As Advertised,"The bag is black, just as in the picture. There is absolutely nothing on it with a Mossy Oak break up pattern as the title suggests. And as far as the zipperless compartments that are described in the features, The one I received has not one, but two zippers on each compartment. Maybe they're zipperless zippers, I don't know but they work just like the one on my jeans so I'm calling them zippers that zip.The bag is nice enough but it is nothing like Amazon's description!"
3,Ritual - self-titled (Inside Out),"Looks to be the Swedish folk / progressive rock band's first record. I know I've seen this CD available in various dealer catalogs, online stores, etc. Only downside of this CD is that I thought it was simply TOO Yes-like. Other than that, it's a decent effort by the little known four piece. Tunes I was semi-impressed with were ""Wingspread"", ""Solitary Man"" and the catchy ""Dependence Day"" (good riff). Line-up: Patrik Lundstrom - guitar & vocals, Fredrik Lindquist - bass, Jon Gamble - keyboards & harmonica and Johan Nordgren - drums. Just might appeal to some fans of Genesis, Yes, Alan Parsons and Flash."
1,Don't buy this monitor.,"I picked up this monitor over the weekend because my old one died on me and I needed to finish something that day. I went out and selected from whatever was readily available and chose this monitor as it was only one of two CRT models available.The image is nice for the most part but there are two problems that really bother me:1. The explorer bar (Windows XP) at the bottom of the screen shifts a little--vertically and horizontally by a few pixels--when you open and close a window. It doesn't prevent the monitor from being usable, but it's really annoying and I've never seen any other monitor do that.2. The max resolution is 1280 x 1024 as they claim, but the only refresh rate at that resolution is 60Hz and I personally can't stand to look at a screen at 60Hz. 75Hz becomes available if you switch the resolution to 1152 x 864.I've already ordered a replacement and will be returning this one."
4,thought provoking,"Crossman's book was written in the nineteenthirties but is stillthought provoking. He analyses Plato's influence on today's institutions.Particularly revealing is the chapter ""Plato looks at British Democracy"" which calls into doubt that we live in atrue democracy. After all, in which sense can the people be said to rule? Only in the most abstract one when we compare representative democracy with direct democracy in Athens.Rather, today we have elite rule, justified by the occasional election."
1,Votivo,This deep clover product stinks. I do not like it at all. I have used the Forest # 83 product inthe past but much to my dismay it has been discontinued. I havelooked everywhere to find some but to no avail. It was a great product!!!!If anyone out there can lead me to a couple of bottles I would be forevergreatful..Thanks grs
4,Mistitled...,"It's a great book, as everyone else says, but imo the author missed an opportunity for an equally great title; it should have been called, ""And Your Little Dog Too."""
5,This Book is Wonderful,This book transported me to Hollywood in the 30's. It was such a wonderful book to read. The Story about Clark Gable alone was worth the price of the Book!!
5,My heart belongs to Toto!,"As a child, my favorite movie was THE WIZARD OF OZ. For Chirstmas ,I received this wonderful book that is all about the famous ""pet-actress"" named ""Toto"". (Yes, Toto was actually a little female dog named Terry,not a male , as most people would think).Anyhow, this book is all about the tiny Cairn Terrier ""Toto"" (Terry) and how she came about becoming one of the principal characters in the movie.The photos are just amazing also. My favorite photos are the behind-the-scene photos showing Toto ""acting"" in the actual movie, just as the trainer was in the background giving Toto her directions. Sooo cute!If you are a dog fan, or a Cairn Terrier fan, or a Wizard of Oz fan, you'll love this book."
4,Eye-catching Post-it Notes,"I use these to expedite outgoing mail. I can print an image of a letter-carrier putting a letter into a customer's hand, and the time when the carrier picks up the mail from the drop box printed on the label, and, for some reason, these make it to their destination about 99% by the NEXT day. This product would have gotten 5 stars, if it were available in 10 other colors, including bright florescents. Whatever I can do to give working people recognition makes the quality of my life better. With a little imagination, these printable post-its are better than money."
1,"misleading photo, not enough info","My husand ordered this item looking for a battery operated clip on fan. The description did not indicate it was battery operated OR AC, but the photo shows no cord. He ordered it based on the photo shown. Shipping and restocking fees made me decide to keep it rather than lose basiclly the cost of the fan $$ !!As to quality of the item - hey - it's a fan."
2,Doesn't live up to claims,"This seems like a good idea if you are having sleep trouble. Melatonin in the brain is important for turning on sleep. I really wanted this to work. But this guy must not pass the blood-brain barrier and ever make it to the brain. Or maybe it's just too low a dose to be any good. In any case, nothing but nothing happened after several nights of trying it out. Absolutely no effect. If forced to say something nice, I'd note there were no side effects either. Save you money."
2,Time release doesn't act long enough,"I have taken other brands of Time Release Melatonin and they help me sleep till morning. This formation doesn't seem to last that long. While this might be exactly right for someone else, it did not live up to my expectations."
3,The Mannings,Good story of a dynasty comming from not the last century but at least from two centuries now!
1,What gives WB?,"I agree strongly with these other reviews, I won't spend my money on a cheap spin-off created by the WB as a last ditch attempt to pan off a perfectly good sitcom.Come on now, the invention of DVD has breathed new life back into many classic sitcoms and just because of the unecstatic turn out of season1 don't deprive us of season 2 and on.Thanks for reading, please take an initiative to write your own review if you feel the same."
1,waste of time,"Here are the actual episodes direct from the web site of Warner Brothers:1. All You Need is Love - Season 1 (Aired 1/4/84) 2. Her Honor, Part 1 - Season 4 (Aired 4/29/87) 3. Her Honor, Part 2 - Season 4 (Aired 5/6/87) 4. Death of a Bailiff - Season 5 (Aired 10/15/87) 5. Who Was that Mashed Man - Season 5 (Aired 11/19/87) 6. Fire - Season 6 (Aired 11/2/88) - 1I can pick much better episodes than these."
3,It could have been better.,"I have been a huge fan of the Night Court series since the beginning. The quirky characters, the outrageous situations and bizarre courtroom antics made this show tops in my book. Unfortunately, this DVD barely scraped the surface. The Her Honor episodes were in 4 parts not 2, and I personally could have found better episodes for this DVD. It's fine for the casual fan but a die hard fan like myself would like more. What's it going to take for Warner Bros. to put out more Night Court?"
1,Why not Season 2?,"Night Court is a very funny show, and I will not stand to see a classic go down the drain! A BEST OF dvd should not be the answer for bad sales on Season 1! Everyone knows that the better, more memorable episodes occured after the first season. Why couldn't Warner Bros just come out with Season 2, and consider what they should do from those sales? I'm sure all Night Court fans are as disgusted as I am to see such horrible treatment being done to such a classic. Anyone who feels the same should give a 1 star for this dvd with a review explaination that we want a SEASON 2 DVD set!!!!! Believe me, I am not going to spend my own money on such an unappropriate bestof dvd."
1,Compilation? NO .....Season 2? YES,I bought Season 1 -- which admittedly was a so-so set of episodes -- and am eagerly waiting for Season 2 and beyond. I loved watching them when they first aired and rediscovered them on late-night TV (via the DVR). Now it's time for the rest of them to appear on DVD......
1,"Full, Complete Season Two or NOTHING!!!","Buy yourselves a clue, WBTV. SOMEone connected with your company must be reading one-star review after one-star review of this product, by this point.NO ONE. WANTS. THIS.Season Two. NOW."
1,What About Season 2,"I grew up watching Night Court on TV in the 80's and early 90's and regarded it as one of my favorite comedy series along with MASH. I eagerly awaited the release of the series on DVD and when season 1 came out, I picked up a copy on the first day of release and anxiously awaited the second season. Over a year later and still nothing!! This favorites compilation is what I consider a slap in the face of every Night Court fan!! WBTV needs to get a clue and figure out what fans want. If they have a difficult time marketing one of the funniest and most successfully 80's TV comedies, then maybe their marketing department needs an overhaul. Don't penalize dedicated fans any longer and release the rest of the seasons NOW!!"
1,'Nuff said.,"Night Court season one is the *ONLY* DVD I have *EVER* pre-ordered.If seasons two through nine showed up on Amazon tomorrow I would pre-order them too. This bargain bin, point-of-sale compilation is no substitute and not a barometer for potential sales to series collectors. Not every season was gold, but proud to own the set I'd be! If the studios don't fill the demand soon enough they run the risk of DVD bootlegs, as happened with WKRP.Once season three discs come out, watch those sales skyrocket."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!,"I must whole heartedly AGREE with everyone else. Why would anyone waste hard earned money on this piece of garbage when if it ""sells well"" these so called favorite episodes are on the other DVD's. I would buy ALL seasons but absolutly not someone elses choice of favorites, obviously chosen by someone who is not a huge fan of the show!!"
1,Where is SEASON 2???,I have Complete Season 1 and have been watching ever since for Season 2 thru 9. I agree with the other similar reviews; Will NOT buy this one!!!
1,Still waiting for Season 2,"One of the best TV shows ever. What's the hold-up? Is the ""bottom line"" the only way the miniscule minds of moguls work?"
2,Night Court TFC,"I enjoyed the sample which is all this disc is.I,like so many others want season 2.I my self would be willing to pay a little more just to get them to print it. This disk just leaves me wanting more."
3,This is okay for a sample of a Series.,"Night Court was one the most memorable shows on NBC in the 80's. In my opinion, this is an okay sampling of two or three seasons of the show. This is not a perfect compliation because there seems to be a ""Her Honor part 3 that's not here. Her Honor pt 3 was when judge Harry T. Stone had working on a prank involving the Statue of Liberty in his apartment. With the time span of the series there is no way to put all of the best episodes on a single DVD. It will be very nice when WB releases all of the other seasons."
1,not impressed,Agree with all the other reviewers. I can't wait for season 2 to come out on dvd and refuse to buy this one.
4,"pretty good sampling, not too expensive...","As a fan back in the day, I am happy with this DVD. The two ""Her Honor"" episodes are amognst my favorites, while ""Death of a Baliff"", ""Who was that Mashed Man"" and ""Fire"" are all good ones too. I haven't watched this show in years, but some how I remember almost evey line. I was also suprised at how low priced the DVD is. 2 dollars for the disc, and 3 for shipping? I'll take 6 eposides of Night Court for 5 bucks any day..."
1,Poor episode selection consisting of edited syndication prints make for pissed NC fans,"This ""Best Of"" (yeah right) Night Court DVD is subpar in all respects. For one, I want the full seasons rather than a compilation like this, and secondly, the selection of the episodes on this DVD downright sucks (they only have the first two episodes the ""Her Honor"" four-parter). Here's what the suits say are the ""best"" that Night Court had to offer:1.) ""All You Need is Love"" (which we already have UNCUT on the Season 1 DVD)2.) ""Her Honor, pt 1""3.) ""Her Honor, pt 2""4.) ""Death of a Bailiff""5.) ""Who Was that Mashed Man""6.) ""Fire""Also, it must be made known that the episodes on this compilation DVD are the cut-all-to-hell episodes shown in syndication. Spread the word so we don't get shafted like this again."
1,An insult to true fans,"I must agree with everyone else. This DVD is an insult to any Night Court fan. This show was one of the best and it deserves to be treated as such. Unlike some others, I did buy this collection. However, it does not include many of the most memorable episodes. I work for a production company and we distribute higher quality cases and cover art with draft versions of DVD projects than this professionally released DVD.PLEASE... BRING OUT THE SECOND SEASON!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,complete seasons please!!!!!!!!!!!!,"They release shows like gem, hearts afire (short lived) the flash, and they can't even get one of the greatest shows of the 80's and part of the 90's in it's completed form. Warner needs to push forward and complete this good show for it's history and fan base, no best ofs"
1,Give us season 2,"Enough already, give us season 2! I will absolutely not buy a compilation ""best of DVD"" when I WANT THE WHOLE SERIES. Night Court was exceptionally funny and stands as one of the most classic three camera sitcoms of the last thirty years. Give me a break Warner Brothers."
1,Night COurt TV Comp.,"I am in absolute agreement with the others who would like to see more than just season one of night court. I also own season one, and want to see the rest, especially the later years.."
3,Can't wait for Season 2!!,"I may not have enjoyed this DVD favorites collection as well as the Season 1 set, but I felt compelled to buy it. My assumption is that Warner Bros will not release the Season 2 DVDs unless this favorites DVD sells well. I have been a fan of Night Court since it premiered, and have seen every episode. It would be such a shame not to see Season 2 released. I am sure that I speak for every Night Court fan out there that it would sell much better than the first season. After all, the show just kept getting better and better each season!"
1,Garbage!,"Don't waste your money. These earrings are garbage. They don't look like the picture; the stones have no dimension. In fact, they look so flat that when I wore them, someone asked if I was wearing earrings or stickers on my ears! I don't have to worry about that anymore, though, because they BROKE ON THE FIRST DAY I wore them! The stone just fell out of the setting!"
1,Big Heep Of Rubbish,"Having been a Heep fan since the mid 70's , I remember the first time I heard this on vinyl . All I can say is , what was Ken and Mick thinking . John Sloman is awful . The only decent song is ""Feelings"" . This is only for real Heep fans who need to have it for their collection . For a better Heep CD try ""Demons and Wizards"" , ""Sweet Freedom"" or more recently ""Sonic Origami"" ."
4,"Atypical for the band, but not bad at all","Conquest is probably the most atypical of all Uriah Heep albums. The songs have a tailored commercial feel and are tailored around the rangy voice of new vocalist John Sloman (in what would be his only Heep album). However, the songwriting continues to be strong and the production is immaculate. A fine and diverse record overall, but not recommended as an introduction to the band because it is far removed from the classic Uriah Heep style and sound. Still, a very good album."
3,Underrated,"This is by no means the fiasco some fans would have you believe; it just doesn't sound much like Uriah Heep. Vocalist John Sloman, formerly of Lone Star, doesn't have a bad voice, but it's wildly unsuited for both the band and the material. While the album does suffer somewhat as a result, there are some excellent songs here, including ""No Return"", and two of the best tracks bassist Trevor Bolder has written: ""Fools"", and ""It Ain't Easy"", the latter being one of the greatest songs Heep has ever recorded. Definitely worth a listen. (BTW, if you're looking for the worst Heep album, it's 1985's ""Equator"", without question)."
2,"For Diehard fans only, maybe",I Guess I'm not a diehard fan or maybe I don't need to be to like this album. (...). He belongs with a Bay City Roller type band or Shawn Cassidy solo act type thing. His voice ruins the few would-have-been good songs. I have a lot of 'Heep but after about about 2 times of listening to this cd (original release) I returned it. Don't recommend re-release unless you just have to own all of their studio releases. Bonus tracks still have crummy gay voice. (...)
3,pop rock hard rock mixture heep,The heepsters had been on a hard rock pop rock mixture a for three years? by the time of this one. They did this well but this one is more leaning toward pop than some of their stuff. It's good pop but a smart hard rockin band has lots of hard rock and some pop not half and half. Still songs like 'been hurt' are as good as even pop song on the radio then or now. Obviously you must be a fan of pop rock hard mixture music to like this one. But the heep always had beautiful backing vocals and tight instrumentalization skills. But obviously fans want mainly hard rock and a little pop from the boys and this is not that. So completists will want this one and newer fans should go for something pre-1977 or post this one.
5,5+,"Oh my gosh! This book was sooo good! It is one of my favorite books ever! Okay, first Brad and Lavinia get this million+ horse and think he is better than Pride. They think Pride is burnt out because of his injury. But then Pride beats their horse, Lord Ainsley. Lavinia and Brad are furious. They try all sorts of tricks to get to Ashleigh and she is getting married too. At Ashleigh's wedding Charlie has a heart attack and dies! :(!!! Charlie was soooooo cool! I miss him so much as I continue to read this series. Ashleigh doesn't think she can go on without him, especilly when B and L didn't tell Ashleigh that Jilly couldn't ride and put up a jockey from Mexico who listens to B and L's instructions but not Ash's. He holds Pride back and almost ruins him, then Pride breaks away and wins anyway. Lavinia and Brad are furious. When they go to the winner's circle Pride tried to bite L and they leave. Shows those snobby Townsend Acres brats that Whitebrook always comes out on TOP!"
5,Pride and Sammy are fantastic!,This book is a) really really interesting and has all my favourite characters in it and b) so exciting I could hardly put it down! Pride is the most fantabulous horse and Sammy and Ashleigh are really great too. I cheered when Lavinia and Brad got their comeuppance. If you haven't got this book or havent read it I suggest you do!
3,Not what i expected!,It was not what i expected. I thought it was going to be body tight! but it is big.
1,A Poor Substitute for the Sony Cybershot Carrying Case,"I purchased this product after I had already bought the authentic version in an electronics store. Since I was very pleased with the one I had, I decided to buy another carrying case for the friend for whom I had bought another Sony Cybershot camera as a Christmas present. Unfortunately, this one I purchased from this vendor on Amazon.com was a poor replica of the authentic Cybershot Carrying case. The velcro cover is annoying, the quality of the leather is very poor and is very rigid. Even the Sony emblem was created and inserted in a see-through ""pouch"". The seller should have clearly stated that this was not the original Sony Cybershot carrying case, but they did not do so. Needless to say, I am highly dissatisfied with the purchase."
2,Did not work for me,"I purchased this cable for a bedroom TV configuration.The cable is very thin and the connectors seem to be of high quality. However, when I tried it, I had bad ghosting and interference patterns on my screen. I checked the connections and made sure everything was tightly and properly connected. I still noticed a drastic reduction in picture quality.Removing the cable and trying it on a different TV, I noticed the same problem.I give this cable high marks for its size, right angle connector and ability to easily hide. But I give it low marks for quality and reliability.I cannot recommend this product based on my experiences."
5,Labeling Tape,I have used this product for a long time to label folders for tax time information. It's so much easier than hand labeling since you can put one label over another and reuse the folders. It does everything it's suppose to.
4,Brilliant! *Four Stars*,"Wow-this rocks! Grover was a great little band from Chapell Hill, NC with a unique power-pop-heavy-guitar sound, and one awesome lead vocalist, Angie Carlson. Great tunes, infectious guitar hooks, uplifting melodies, with emotional, off beat witty lyrics- a really good album...Favorite songs are ""Yeah, I'm Dumb"", ""Parachute"" and ""Anesthesia"". A Mitch Easter/Kevin Salem production...Whatever happened to Grover?-Mike AcquistoSacramento,CA"
4,nice,it works very well but takes too long to fold down and is very wide forcing me to fold it down to get it in the house. seems very well made.
4,Great Value,"I was looking for a reasonably priced bicycle trailer and, frankly, was a little suspicious when I found this one. My suspicions were misplaced. This trailer/stroller is great. It arrived quickly, was simple to assemble and easy to attach to the bike. It is lightweight and pulls well. I recommend this trailer."
5,Romain Gary's BEST (?) book?,"It is a wondeful momoir written by a son raised by a strong woman in France, as an immigrant. Her high expectations from her son give the son the opportunity to develop and to acheive despite problems in their live. Don't forget to read Romain Gary's White Dog."
5,This is my Scent,"I have been using this fragrance for about 10 yrs now. It's becoming harder to find in stores. This fragrance is clean, soft and very SEXY."
4,A Great Puppy Book for Children and Adults,"A darling book with precious photographs and a sensitive story line. The featured puppy is a cuddly Welsh Spriinger Spaniel (no, he's not a Britanny) with a cute personality. Children will love this book and adults will love reading it to them."
4,These are great books,"While not quite as hillarious as the little kitten, the little puppy brings it in a great story about getting a puppy, and all the work that goes with it."
1,Expensive product for little results,"Honestly, how can they sell this product at this price when it doesn't do anything."
1,Lost footage..worst technical equipment I've ever owned,"My title says it all. I've lost footage several times, corrupt discs all the time. The worst part is, it makes you think you're recording, and then you go to play it back, and it's not there. This is a certified piece of junk. Mine may just be a lemon based on other reviewers, but why take the risk when it comes to recording fun memories?"
3,This camcorder doesn't work for Apple Mac's,"I bought this for my sister as a wedding present. The camera has a lot of good features. But when they used a set of DVDs on it, they found that only 1/2 of the discs they used would record correctly. not sure if the problem is with the disks or formatting.More importantly, this camcorder does not allow for the video to be transferred to Apple Mac's. It only allows images taken with the camera to be transferred. This is a big disappointment and we will have to sell this camera on Ebay now or something.Usually i'm a big fan of Canon camcorders and camera's. I'm on my 2nd Canon camcorder now and just bought a digital camera. But Canon should have made this camera with support for Mac's. its ridiculous."
5,Quality performance,This camera really met and exceeded my expectations. It does crystal clear work which is very benificial to our ministry.
1,Order canceled twice Don't waist your time!,"Purchased Horse & Rider magazine subscription through Amazon.com. Got conformation email. Few days later got order canceled, please reorder email. Reordered and the same thing happened again. Don't waist your time with this...just subscribe through Horse & Rider."
3,"Good Magazine, but slow service","The magazine is good, but ordering through Amazon has its drawbacks. I ordered in on 12/18/08 and won't get the first issue until 3/19/09 (at lease that is what it says on my order). I should have paid the extra money and subscribed directly from the magazine."
1,horse & Rider,I have not recieved this magazine although I have recieved others that I subscribed to at the same time.
5,Great labels,"We use a few Dymo 400 label printers at work for small sized mailings. These labels work perfectly and produce crisp, clean text using the Dymo's thermal print head. Amazon sells them cheaper than just about anyone including free shipping.Great labels at a great price. Recommended."
1,GB (Gardner Bender) GSW-31 Pull-Chain Switch,"This switch is under-designed garbage. Zero stars would be a more accurate rating. The first one I installed only lasted one month before the pathetically wimpy plastic lever inside the switch that holds the end of the chain broke. The warranty replacement switch I received from GB failed in the exact same way after three month in service. See the picture I posted above of this failure. I am the only one who used the switch for about 20 off / on cycles per day so I know that the chain was never over tensioned.The Leviton pt no. 10041-500 (6A 125 VAC) would be a much better (but not problem free) choice for a pull-chain switch (occasionally available on eBay). See my review of the lower amperage rated Leviton 10097-008 switch on Amazon for details that are also relevant to the 10041-500.Leviton 10097-8 Pull Chain Switch, Single Pole On-Off; 1A-125V T, 3A-125V, 1A-250V; With Two 6 Inch Black Leads 18 Awg Awm Tew 105C 600V, Stripped 1/2 Inch"
2,"The title should be ""The Technology of Scientific Documents""","This book is 600 pages long and focuses on the technology of producing documents. For example it has a Chapter entitled ""Writing Techniques"" but it is all about the technology of word processors (even a subhead on ""mouse techniques""); within that chapter the section on Text is about fonts, not words. I found it extraordinary that a book entitled ""The Art of Scientific Writing"" did not have a single chapter about actual writing--using words and language to communicate ideas. There is certainly useful information here--for example, very few books in the genre discuss how to deal with writing and publishing a book. But if you are looking for help in learning how to write papers and communicate your ideas and your work powerfully, I would not recommend this book. Its title misrepresents its content."
5,Great prep for the exam,"With this book and some real-world experience in ColdFusion you should be able to pass the Macromedia exam without a problem. Don't get me wrong - the exam isn't easy - but Mr Forta covers all of the relevent parts in focused chapters that cover what is needed to pass the exam and excel in CF. After getting an Advanced level certification last month, I find I'm still using this book as a reference on day-to-day stuff. Highly recommended."
5,"Comprehending Behavioral Statistics, 4th Edition",The book arrived in perfect condition with a CD that was never opened. It seems pretty straightforward and has online examples to illustrate some of the key points.
2,"Mandatory for class, but not worth it","If you've ever taken a statistics class, you won't really need this book.That's because it will confuse you more.It's dry, boring, and as far as textbooks go, not very effective in helping you learn the material. This book is designed for psychology majors, and as far as psych texts go, this is a horrible text.However, Hurlburt really tries. He has a CD that's helpful, albeit kinda lame, but it definitely puts the material into a better format than the actual text."
5,Authentic Laos Cuisine,"If you would like to prepare Laos food like that you would find in Luang Prabang, on the Banks of the Mekong, Pakse, etc, this is the book. Great recipes that include both the classics and obscure recipes. Good luck finding some of the ingrediants outside of South East Asia though. A very thoughtful approach from a Master Chef."
2,Good concept although my puppy didn't like the taste.,My puppy didn't like these. She did chew one of them a little bit but didn't seem interested in it after the one time. I don't know if it was the taste or the consistency but she just didn't like it. I would not buy them again.I was glad they are small enough for a little dog or puppy. I have a morkie and she is only 5lbs at 3 months old so finding small things for her to chew is a challenge sometimes.
2,Comes off in Chunks,I brought my pup one of this when he started to finish his Puppy Nylabone too quickly. At first he didn't take it because it didn't smell like anything. I slowly played with him with this bone and he took it. Then he just ripped them into huge chunks! He even swallowed some and vomited afterward! This are way too soft they should make it a bit stronger and add more flavoring.
1,A Dissenting View,"From the other reviews, I gather this book is useful to some people, so I'll try to be balanced in my criticism. Perhaps this book is helpful for those who have extremely mainstream, fastfood tastes. no experience with vegetarian food, and no cooking background. For others, however, this book is useless. Much of it involved (1) descriptions of premade vegetarian meat substitutes that can be purchased in supermarkets and (2) elementary cooking ingredients and techniques. The recipes include instructions on how to ""pizzazz"" a commercial frozen pizza with Green Giant hamburger crumbles. I'd like to see vegetarianism spread in this country so perhaps this book can perform a public service. But it's not for the serious cook, and I am going to return it."
5,Easy and delicious,"I love the recipes in this book. They are both easy and delicious, and are geared to living in the real world. The ingredients are readily available and good for you. Plus, the recipes don't require the kind of time commitment required by many vegetarian dishes. It is a great book for busy families who want a healthy vegetarian lifestyle."
3,"not terrible, but pretty disappointing","I guess having been vegetarian for a very long time, and been cooking for myself for a long time, when I get a new cookbook I want to see something really amazing.This book doesn't have any recipes that make me go wow.. and worse (as already mentioned in the 1 star review) it's mostly based around commercial meat substitutes. I'll take it one step further - commercial meat substitutes commonly found in supermarkets of the USA.As a result it's sat on my shelf since I bought it, and I haven't made anything from it. The recipes don't look horrible, just not appealing or useful.In closing, I imagine this book would be great for someone if they were an american youth learning how to cook for themselves - maybe living alone or in a share house for the first time and also starting to be concerned about the idea of meat consumption but also scared of ""weird food""... In that case, buy up. It'll help you a lot."
4,BIRTHDAY GIFT,"This item ended up being part of a manufacturer's recall and the return/exchange was a less then pleasurable experience at not fault of Amazon. The product arrived in a timely fashion and was in excellent condition, but the recall was a hassle. All's well that ends well and my grand-daughter enjoyed her birthday gift."
3,Okay,"This book wasn't the greatest biography written about Shannon Miller. Of course, since it was written by Shannon's mother, the book does have a lot of little minor details and stories, and some of them were very interesting. (Like the one about Shannon dressing up as a grocery bag complete with the groceries one Halloween!) However, when it came to Shannon's competitions, the book had so many details about every little thing going on that it kind of became overwhelming, and sometimes I would put the book down, forget about it, and return to it days later. Needless to say, this book was a little bit boring. In fact, it's almost 300 pages long. Seems like a lot of pages for chronicling a nineteen-year-old's life! All and all, if you're looking for a good biography about Shannon, I would recommend reading ""Winning Every Day"" by Shannon Miller, or ""Shannon Miller: America's Most Decorated Gymnast"" by Krista Quiner."
5,only one word: terrific!,"I'm from the Netherlands and i love the gymnasts from the USA, but espacially Shannon, so when i found this book on internet I had to get it, and so I did, And it was great, I have reading it out in two days. It begins when Shannon is about a year of 4 and so it go's on to the olympics 1996. It's just amazing to read how she won medals while she was injured. And how she works with Steve and Peggy. I thougt they always get along together, but well you got to read this book, and then you know how hard a live of a gymnast can be. By the way, the pictures are also terrific! more then 80 pictures! just buy it."
4,Overall a good book,"This is a great book to read if you're a fan of shannon, obviously, but also if you were a fan of gymnastics during the early 1990's. It's fun to read about all the different meets that you saw on tv and see the athletes perspective and the behind the scenes stuff. Claudia Miller discusses, in depth, the controversial 1994 team worlds where Shannon and Nunno left the competition early. She also talks about Shannon's stalker at the 1994 Nationals. The only thing that annoyed me about this book is that sometimes Claudia passed over certain situations and made everything seem perfect when you know it wasn't. Oh well, still worth a read, buy a used copy if you can."
3,limited usefulness,"Because it is written in terms of ""we will do this, etc."" instead of ""they will do this, etc."" the book makes prenups more understandable but is less useful for someone who wants to do their own."
2,Beware of ordering the 1992 edition!,"I ordered this book based upon the rapturous reviews. No one seemed to notice or care if the book was non-algebraic. Well it is the 1965 book without any updates. Since I saw 1992 in the description of this edition I thought it would be safe to buy and not get the old notation. Sorry Charlie! Dover re-issued the 1965 book AS IS. It has been an interesting excercise, no doubt, trying to follow these games when the notation is, for example, 1. P-Q4 P-Q4 2. P-QB4 P-QB3 3. Kt-QB3 Kt-B3 4. B-Kt5 P-K3....etc....And those are just the easy ones. Caveat Emptor!"
5,A masterpiece,"For anyone who is interested in the study of Grandmaster games, this book is the ideal one. It offers superb analysis, easy to understand reasoning, as well as variations that will get you thinking.Chernev does another great job at dissecting great games, which in combination denotes a powerful force. This book is ideal for anyone studying chess tactics or openings who hopes to relate what they learned to master games.Even if you do not enjoy reading over GM games, this book is still excellent. You will gain a lot from reading it, I guarantee it.[After reading through it and studying it, your ELO should and could go up about 100-150 points.]"
3,A word of warning : Descriptive notation,"I just received this book. It comes highly recommended and I don't doubt it will prove as entertaining and instructive as all the other reviewer says it is.A word of warning though! It comes in DESCRIPTIVE notation, not in the more usual algebraic notation. Strange in a time where most classics are reprinted as algebraic.To me, and probably to many others, it makes the book significantly harder to read. I was surprised not to see that item highlighted in the reviews, so I just thought I'd mention it. Happy checkin' to everybody!"
3,Good but onesided view,"This is a book that contains a variety of different games that are supossed to be instructive. Some of the games are interesting and some are rather boring. The author takes on the side of the winner, showing with exclamation points the brilliant moves, but not the weaker moves when they are made, except by the losing side. Often a good defense or better move was available that is not pointed out. Personally I like this author's other book ""Logical Chess Move by Move"" and ""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"" much better that show the ideas behind every move and doesn't seem to take sides.This is still a good book, but very biased toward the winner of each game that effects the quality of the analysis."
2,60 uses then dead,"I got tired of buying cheap glass only blenders that break. This comes with both a glass and metal jar and even if one breaks I am still ahead. It's noisy, so what! It's like a dinner bell screaming ""Hey Margaritas are on!""Updated 5 years later. Well it gave up the ghost and died. I'm disappointed in that it is not like I used it daily. Maybe once a month. So 60 total uses over the past five years causes me to lower my rating. The only plus it that the metal and glass containers seem to fit well on the replacement I bought."
2,Bitter!,Yikes! This tea is bitter. Even with lots of honey the aftertaste is horrible. Order the capsules if you want the benefits of feverfew.
4,Sumo book,"This book concerns all matters of sumo, instead of living in a heya (sumo stable) it describes and shows in many pictures (1/3 colour, 2/3 b/w) the life during jungyo (tours of sumo wrestlers over Japan). So it focussed not the 5 % well known wrestlers, but the 95 % normal wrestlers."
3,Expess to finish,It was a good looking platformer in its day. However the difficulty was non-existent. I would time trial this game for fun. Easy to beat in under 30 minutes.
2,Disappointing...,"If you saw the Webb Sisters with Leonard Cohen this year, or heard their spine-tingling cover of his ""If it Be Your Will""...you will be sadly disappointed. I must agree with the previous poster on this. The vocals and harmonies are lovely but overshadowed by the choice of music, which is just flat-out boring. There is so much potential here; it would be wonderful to hear an album that showcases their glorious voices. I would advise you to save your money on this one, and hope for something a little better in the future."
2,Nice harmonies but weak songs,"The Webb sisters once again demonstrate perfect singing capabilities. It is a shame that the material they are working with on this album does not give their talents more challenge. Their singing is beautiful and harmonies perfect, but in the long run a little boring. I prefer them in the more challenging combination with Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson. Not bad but not good either."
5,Finally on CD - 3 Decades later - All time classic,"Track listnings as before on LP but here in crystal clear sound.Every song a treasure, every minute a pleasure. :)1 Stoplight 03:452 Anybody Wanna Party? 05:223 Please, Be There 04:354 Going Out Of My Head 05:385 I Will Survive 08:076 You Can Exit 05:207 I Said Yes 04:038 Substitute 03:05TOTAL PLAYING TIME: 39:46"
2,odd,"a collection of short stories filmed in the mid 90s. A very unusual colecion. If you are looking for a quality film, pass this one up. I enjoy lack of quality so this entertained me."
3,WTF,"The best part of this collection for me was the fact that most the time when the movie ended the feeling of WTF washed over me. The stories are for the most part very artsy as the other reviewer mentioned and also very short, like 15 to 20 minutes. I will say for the most part I liked the collection but I think most people would not. The stories, while mostly good and interesting plots seemed to have a hard time wrapping up the ending so they just ended it abruptly."
3,Good book from an earlier astral explorer at 20 th century,"This book is similar with Journeys Out of The Body (Monroe) and OBE ; How to Have Them and What to Expect (Peterson). Oliver Fox shared his own experience, complete with the date or month when he did it. Yes, this is a how to book. You can find two technique to have OBE in this books. First, the dream awakening. Fox teached how to make a lucid dream and start OBE from it. Second, the pineal doorway. How you can make OBE from trance state, this is it.Fox is an occultist. He learned from Azelda, his non physic master whom comunicated with him via ouja board. The most interested part in this book was Elsie's prjection. Fox told his girl friend about his astral projection. He surprised when find out Elsie can did it too, and can described his room perfectly without ever see it !!!"
3,He's just a rookie.,"This book is a great read if you just want to read about this guys experiences that took place from about 1900-1930. But if you want to learn how to do OBE don't buy it, he hardly knew. This guy is self taught and is a complete amiture (he admits it himself.) Not a good book for the beginner or the experienced, but just fun, fast and smooth to read on his less then successful projections. It also only contains about five very vague pages for instructions on how to do."
3,Only about four lousy pages on how. Wrote in 1930.,"This book is a fast good interesting read, but is not very insightful at all. Hey, I have to give credit to Oliver Fox for being a self-pioneer at his experiences, but don't buy the book if you want a book on how to tell YOU to experience Aetherism, astral projection. The book is basically just a record of his not so good performances."
4,Not bad product,"the only thing that I do not like with this product is the jack (head), because from the 6 heads, they are not have the same size. So, when I tried to plug the cable to my tv and dvd, some heads very difficult to be plug in, the other too loose and other just fine."
2,Didn't do the job,"I have a Vizio 42"" plasma that was connect to my HD DVD and H20 Directv dish via an HDMI cable. My HDMI connection broke (long story)so I had these Monster component cables lying around and I connected them. These cable don't do the job. The picture now has lots of noise and grainy and is simply not as smooth as with a Acoustic Reasearch HDMI cable."
2,Buy the Cheap ones!,"Using the component input on your TV can make a huge difference in picture quality, but the differentce between the lower priced monster cables and the most expensive monster cables in not noticeable. Save yourself $50 and buy the cheap ones."
3,No noticeble differnece.........yet.,"I have not seen much difference in terms of video quality, however, I have seen a dramatic decrease in terms of interference by my other e-devices around my little HT."
4,Situationally Great!!!,I understand that some people do not need this product. Personally I have to use a hub (switch box) for my components because I only have one HD input for my TV. I was experiencing serious signal loss due to the hub. As I replaced each wire with Monster Cables the picture was better until all wires were Monster and the picture was perfect. My signal loss consisted of lines that would roll up the screen...usually two at a time and they were just a slight shade lighter than everything else on the screen. You could only notice it when the picture on the TV was still or a close face shot...but aggravating nonetheless.Bottom line - if you're experiencing signal loss this should fix your problem - otherwise you can probably stick with the cheap ones
1,Monster Cables are a Rip Off,"I compared a Monster Cable vs one the one from Phillips which costs less than half this. And guess what, no difference. That's right. They rip you off. And what's the purpose off a gold plated connection if the rest of the signal passes through a copper cable.It irks me see the staff at BestBuy and Circuit City pitching Monster's $75 Component Cables and $120 HDMI cables at uneducated customers. There are cheaper and equally performing cables out there. Do your research and save some of your hard earned money.By the way, be wary of all the glowing reviews you read on amazon for this product or for others as well. Recently I have been seeing a lot of positive reviews from anonymous reviewers or reviewers with only one review to their name."
4,They work,They work...Look durable. Does that qualify for a five star rating? I will give them four because i bough the cable for under $5.
5,great,must of these songs that never made pjs albums would be the best songs on other bands real albums
4,Not the biggest fan of Pearl Jam,"This collection of songs is pretty good, there are a few I really enjoyed, and just as many that i can't really get my head wrapped around. All and all i liked it more then it was strange!"
5,there has never been a better album in the history of ever,"ok if the title of this review wasnt enough to get you to bye this cd this should. Ok 14 songs that youve never heard before, make that 15.Ok so a few minutes after bee girl theres a tribute song to layne staley. If you hate creed and all the other bands that rip off staleys voice, and coincidently vedders, then you need to hear this song and the only way to do that is to buy this cd. Even if your not a hardcore fan you should think about buying this cd basically because its a good price for two discs and it gives you an over view of the bands entire career."
3,Where's Brother?,"PJ has been my favorite band for many years now. This 2 disc compilation is a great addition to any Pearl Jam fans collection, including mine. I like the songs (most of which I'd heard already live or in some other form), and the blurbs in the album cover.HOWEVER, the fact that they added Brother, an old school rarity favorite of mine, and butchered it by not including lyrics makes me extremely angry. They didn't even mention anything about this in the booklet. I was so excited to see that Brother made the cut and I started screaming and yelling obscenities when I heard no lyrics. Did Ed forget the lyrics over the years? He couldn't learn them again from an old recording?"
5,GET IT !!! (a quick review),"GET THIS ALBUM!Wow! I've always liked Pearl Jam, but this double disk collection proves their greatness. Not only did they have enough extra material lying around to produce one disk, but they had enough to produce two! And this stuff is not just decent faire, rather it is actually BETTER than half of Pearl Jam's albums! Further, the music is varied and mature, probably because the material spans so many years. So forget all the best-ofs and most of the live albums and get this gem!"
1,Pearl Jam Lost Dogs,I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam...this cd SUCKS...Eddie sounds like Bob Dylan...not good...They put every awful song from previous cd's. The best thing about it was the packaging...it was fun to read their personal thoughts on the songs.
3,Eh.,"Lost Dogs by Pearl Jam is good only if your trying to complete a PJ collection. Yellow Ledbetter is the only worthwhile song, and more than likley, you have the jeremy single. Remember, there B-Sides for a reason."
2,One big dissapointment,There's a reason why these numbers weren't on any CD.They're just not good enough.A dissapointed PJ-Fan.
1,no longer a fan,"Used to be a fan, also saw them in concert and have a collection of old albums, but unfortunately I don't listen to them anymore.. Since ""Binaural"". That album was a total disappointment for me. Pearl jam no longer makes music, makes noise. Eddie seems to lost his vocal abilities, sound is worse than ordinary. I dont get it, why do they even bother?this is another album that su***Oh for God's sake leave the mighty 90's in 90's and quit music.."
5,This Album blows my mind!!!!,"This is the best album the band has done (other than Ten). Jeff Ament's song ""Other Side"" is one of the most moving songs I've ever heard! The rest of the album is awesome too! A must buy for any Pearl Jam fan... you will not be disappointed!"
5,Excellent Compilation,This collection of B-Sides is further proof that Pearl Jam needs to have careful consideration given to the fact that they are not just the kings of the 90's grunge movement but one of the best rock and roll bands of all time. I have been a fan from the beginning and this two disc set takes me back to the early days...keep on rockin' the free world!!!!!!!!
5,Can they really get any better?,"Pearl Jam proves that they are the best rock band out there right now with this album. I know not all of the songs are new but damn they are all awesome. Most notably, ""Yellow Ledbetter"", ""Alone"", and ""Black, Red, Yellow."" I am however a little disappointed ed and the gang omitted ""Breath."" I also understand that they can't include every song that they have ever done. I still give this cd a 5 even with the omission of ""Breath. Even if you aren't a Pearl Jam fan, you should buy this and if you are a Pearl Jam fan and you don't have it yet, shame on you! Just kidding. Go get it now."
5,The Best Album I've bought ALL year!,"In an ongoing effort to amaze me, Pearl Jam has released a two disc set of 30 songs that come from the past years of my favorite band...songs from the Ten sessions, from VS., from No Code, Yield, Binaural, Riot Act, benefit cds, soundtracks, they're all here and I haven't even heard some of them before. The old songs are so amazing, it's like the first time you heard Ten or VS., you just sit, smile and cast your mind back to the first day you found out, that this band was ""it""."
3,some things shouldn't be,"This is quite a confusing album. Most of the songs on cd 2 are excellent as are a couple on cd 1. With that being said, albums like Binaural would have been much better if some of the songs on Lost Dogs would have been used there. Furthermore many of the songs on Cd 1 and a couple on Cd2 should never have seen the light of day. This should have been a one disc collection but it seems someone wanted to extract some extra cash out of the fans--something which seems out of keeping with Pearl Jam. The album is worth a buy but do yourself a favor and pick up a used copy."
5,Their Greatest Hits You Never Have Heard,"This collection of Pearl Jam spans from outtakes from 10, to unreleased rarities, to B-sides, to ""10 club"" Christmas singles. You may have heard some of these songs live, but just wait until you hear the studio versions, you are in for a treat. I look at this collection as Pearl Jam's ""Greatest Hits You Never Heard""."
5,not entirely complete/ but still a must needed collection,wheres crazy mary and angel?/ still/ even without those/ you need to add this doubledisc to your collection no matter how big of a pearl jam fan you are/ the 2nd side is better than the first/ but the whole thing is great really/ a little weird at times/ but what pearl jam album isnt? bravo pearl jam
4,Surprisingly good collection of previously uncollected....,"With few exceptions, this collection of previously uncollected Pearl Jam tracks is remarkably good. My biggest surprise is why some of the better tracks were relegated to b-side status to begin with.If you are a Pearl Jam fan, you owe it to yourself to obtain this album for your library. It is not a bunch of low grade throwaways and the price I paid Amazon was very good for a two disc set. The band has included track by track annotations."
5,PJ's Best since Yield,This is great to listen to. Love the collection of raritys and career spaning oddballs. If your a PJ fan you'll want this.
4,Not Just for Pearl Jam Devotees,"Even for bands that I really enjoy, I generally take a dim view of ""B-side and Rarities"" albums. With few exceptions, there is a good reason the material wasn't previously released; it just wasn't up to snuff!Which brings us to LOST DOGS, which is (sort of) one of those few exceptions. If one took the very best material of this two-cd set, one would have a single excellent disc of songs that would rival any other Pearl Jam project. LOST DOGS seems to be ""front-loaded"" with its best stuff, so Disc I is decidedly better than Disc II. But any way you look at it and depending on how you listen to it, you won't be embarrassed by LOST DOGS. (Well, okay, some people might be embarrassed by the remake of ""Last Kiss,"" though I always liked that song.)"
4,Pearl Jam Rarities & B-Side Tracks - A must for any fan,"30 tracks of Pearl Jam rare tracks, B-sides and Studio Demo's were released by Pearl Jam in 2003. They might not be hits but the songs are well worth listening too. The songs show the evolution of Pearl Jam and Ed Vedder's voice is masterful throughout the double CD. I missed the chance to see them Live when they toured Australia but I am more than happy purchasing this - its like the provervial gold at the end of the rainbow.Any serious Pearl Jam fan will enjoy the uniqueness and the comparitive historical sounding of this album. It draws a parallel between the past and the present Pearl Jam."
3,Listen...,It's the damn Hot Rods - what more could you want? It's a bootleg at best - sounds horrible - but it's the Rods. Diehard only I guess.
2,Bad Quality,"The only reason this pack gets 2 starts is because the movies are just that good. But it is worth your money just to buy these 3 movies seperatly. The quality is very, very poor and there are no extras to the dvd. Just buy the movies seperatly. They don't even cost that much on amazon. Check'em out."
1,A cop out,"Edwards does give a reasonably comprehensive treatment of the topic but does avoid making the tough calls in his conclusions.NGO accountability is a huge problem, far greater than Edwards is willing to admit."
3,"""Presented by the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co.""","Video quality on these five b&w; episodes is acceptable. Only show #5 has deep contrast, but the others are watchable. Sound is a different matter. Episodes 2 and 4 have terribly murky audio as if from a misaligned tape head. All here run a full 59 minutes.The manufacturer's logo infrequently appears at lower right of screen. Extras: Text screen bios. Four chapters per program. No subtitles. (List on outer cover and storage box have shows 2 and 3 out of playing order.CONTENTS--(2/4/51) - Guests: Vocalist Polly Bergen, dancers Bob Fosse and Mary Ann Niles(11/4/51) - Guests: Vocalist Dorothy Dandridge, Donald MacBride, Marion Marshall, dancers Bob and Eddie Mayo, Danny Arnold(4/29/51) - Guests: Vocalist Helen O'Connell, dance team Fosse & Niles, gymnast Ladd Lyons(12/30/51) - Guests: Margaret Dumont, Mike Mazurki, vocalist Eve Young (aka Karen Chandler), tap dancer Ray Malone(5/2/54) - Guests: The Treniers, Gretchen Houser, Dick Humphreys, Marvin Seed"
4,Conqueror,This book is a most impressive work on Britains short lived heavy gun tank. A must for all those who crewed this formidable vehicle during the cold war. Anyone interested in armor and in particular Britains tanks will find this work a wealth of information on this vehicle.
5,Punk Diary,"Getting this book is like striking gold for anyone who loves punk rock. It's a treasure-trove of information, in meticulous order. This is the kind of book you can open randomly at any page and just start reading. The author really did his homework. If you want to learn more about punk, you can definitely get the information reading this book."
1,Very disappointed,"I thought that this would be a great book when I picked it up. It started off and had me hooked in the first couple sentences, but the more I continued, the more disappointed I became. Yes, it has some Shaker influences in it and that's understandable and interesting, but then it all ends up Mormon which was not what I was expecting and is suspiciously left off the description on the cover. The book is a novel, so the history given may or may not be accurate, but I wasn't reading it for accuracy of history. I was reading it for pleasure. I didn't think highly of the Mormon persuasion given protrayed in the last half of the book. This book will be going in the garbage."
5,hot item,"Bought a few for friends, made affordable by the price. All three loved them. Good construction."
1,Disapointed by sterotypes and bias in book,"While reading this book to my daughter who is learning about Native American culture for school, we were both shocked to find this sentence: ""Many of the Indian tribes of North America built their culture around the pursuit of war"". This is a horrible misstatement that is not only factually inaccurate but also incredibly disrespectful and offensive to Native American tribes everywhere. It plays into the stereotype of the 'war mongering Indian' which is a falsehood and I am disappointed to see this type of language used in a book claiming to be an educational source on Native American culture. If you want to learn Native American culture, it's safer to get the information from them and not from some biased, ignorant author. Here is a comprehensive list of websites run by various Native tribes themselves: [...]"
5,Real Ceramic Horses,"My daughter love horses and collect them all. My wife purchased these for her and I was surprised to see the good quality of the craft. The instructions are easy to follow, great quality and great price."
3,Not impressed,"This was a Christmas gift and it showed up with one horse broken. My 7 year old was heartbroken. One of the other horse bodies was not glued on the lid straight, so it looks fairly cheap. In the pictures on the box, once the horses are painted and baked, they look shiny. I was disappointed when my daughter spent so much time painting and covering the piece completely to find that they still had the flat, dull paint appearance once they were taken out of the oven. Here I thought she was going to have a very professional looking piece when they were completed, but they still looked like the plaster pieces that you paint and let dry."
3,Didn't match the picture,"The picture made it look nicer than it is. The 15ft cord was as advertised, but otherwise it looks like a plain old power strip."
1,wrong thing,I was sent the 7outlet 15ft cord insted of this item that i bought and did not get so the rating I give it is one star.
5,must read,"The above book is a MUST READ!!! If you have bought books 1 thru 4 in the Cape Refuge Series, this one completes the story line. Terri Blackstock keeps you guessing in this ""who done it"" tale."
4,pretty good,I enjoyed the book but I can enjoy just about any fiction book out there. I think the whole series is good and is worth the price. If you like suspense/mystery with a twist then you'll like it. I recommend it to anyone!
2,not very rough,doesn't scrape any dead skin off. just smells nice and is oily but i wanted a scrub with purpose. not going to buy again
5,D'angelo's Brown Sugar Babe....,"LaLicious Brown Sugar Souffle scrub is incredible! The smell evokes a sense of comfort and ease. Unlike most body scrubs - this is made with actual sugar that melts when lathered on, thus making the whole body scrub process enjoyable (instead of a chore)! I must also recommend using LaLicious's Vanilla Shea Butter Cream afterwards. It is a true simple joy to make the stress and troubles of this world melt away. Enjoy!"
4,Nice Pan for the price,I acutally bought these for my parents and they love them. They love the size and how well it cooks...good for the money
5,Awesome Diaper Bag,"My husband's company gave him this bag and I'm totally stealing it for a diaper bag! It has a lot of nice compartments with inside pockets, side pockets for bottles, tons of room for diapers, several changes of clothes, wipes, toys, pacifiers, etc. The handle on top is very sturdy with a comfortable rubber thick grip. The back and straps are comfortable mesh padding. Hubby will certainly carry it as a diaper bag too. Overall- this bag is amazing, roomy and extremely comfortable to wear!"
1,Forget it,Do not under any circumstances buy a Brother printer. They rig the machine so that it will accept no generic toners. You use a brother toner or the machine won't work. Amazing!
1,A true waste of paper.,"We all love Diablo, Diablo II and 3rd edition. Being a GM, Ibought this book hoping to use the monsters and treasure etc toenhance my campaigns. I expected the book to be a supplement to the3rd edition rules and allow for playing 3rd edition within the Diablogame world.This book is more of a conversion of 3rd edition into ahalf diablo/half 3rd edition game system. The weapons with tweakingcould be used in a 3rd edition campaign, but many of them seem a bitpowerful compared to those in the DMs guide. The monsters are aboutall you can take from this book for a 3rd edition campaign, but eventhat is a bit of a waste of .... Heck I don't even remember seeingstats for Diablo himself? Certainly not his brothers or anyinformation about the NPC's that assist the heroes throughDiablo.In my opinion, Skip this book and skip it fast. Spend your... on a 2nd edition module and convert it to 3rd edition. You willget more for your money!"
2,not too happy with this one,We purchased this phone and have been disappointed with it. You can't hear very clearly and feel like you are straining your ears to hear the other person talk (not static) it sounds like the other person is very far away. The battery also doesn't last long off the hook. So I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Good and terrible,"One or more of the ports will always give you trouble! I am on my 5th one and NONE have worked properly! Good design, easy to screw on after connecting the 1/4"" line, but the goodness stops there. All the ports have SOFT plastic screw adjustments that must be adjusted with a coin. Terrible idea. Looking for a better design on-line as this all my local Ace store carries."
3,strangest book ever,"Have you ever seen a fox family so brave to survive from evil farmers?Mr.Fox and his family have to survive with out coming out of their hole because the farmers will shoot them. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean are nasty farmers after Mr.Fox and the family. They have to face changes when they are living underground. The farmers never stop digging until a certain point. The Fox family used to steal animals from the farms so that is why the farmers are after them.I would give this book three stars. The theme of the story is never to steal from some one."
3,little too violent,"when the young foxes fearfully ask their daddy, the fantastic mr fox, how will we die? will there be dogs? I decided it was not for my 3 year olds. he's clever allright but this is probably a tale best told ( edited by you) and not read."
5,Fantastic,"Hi, the book was a gift for my son for Christmas. Impeccable and prompt. Totally satisfied. Thanks"
1,I don't want my daughter to read this book,"I pre-read this book and I am glad I did. I was really bothered that the mother animals were willing to lie down and die and have their children die rather than to try and escape - by helping ""Mr. Fox"" dig their way out. I don't expect animal behavior to be realistic but this was ridiculous. At the time I had another criticism of the book but I have forgotten it."
4,A little funny,"The book, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fiction story and it is a little boring. Someone has been stealing food from the farms and all the farmers joined together to get Mr. Fox and its family.I don't recommend this book because there are too many boring parts. Also there were many words that I did not understand. It has some interesting parts, but not enough to make the book a good one to read."
4,Fantastic Mr. Fox,"A Fox That`s FantasticYou would love this book. That`s only if you read it.There`s a chicken farmer named Bean. There`s a duck farmer named Bounce. There`s a turkey farmer named Boonce. They wanted to get the fox because the fox kept on taking chickens,ducks,and turkeys.All of Roald Daul books non-fiction.They are all raelly funny.This book is as best as baseball."
4,Ok,Movie Haas more detail. Good short story. I enjoyed it. I recommend it for others to read. High priced. Word
4,Enchantment,"I love this book, in spite of the fact that I have definitely outgrown it by now, but I still enjoy rereading it over and over again. It centers around Mr. Fox, an anthropomorphic sly fox who constantly steals from three cruel nearby farmers in order to provide food for his family. However, when the farmers assemble with guns around his burrow, he is left to devise a plot that will help him obtain more food for the creatures of the underground world. Will the clever Mr. Fox pull this off? Find out in this enchanting tale by Roald Dahl.I love this book and recommend it to you right away. This is perfect for young children to read and could easily be used to interest young newcomers to the world of literature in reading, as are many of Roald Dahl's books. I also would recommend the film to you, as it is very amusing also."
4,Almost as I Remembered it.,"I bought this book as a ""chapter book"" to read with my 4.5yo Son. I remembered it from somewhere in my childhood as a great story.I think its probably better for an older audience as once reading it I realised that the entire premise of the story is angry farmers trying to shoot and kill what the little kids will relate to as cute fluffy animals..Its still a good read but I would say a book to read to/with 6-7yo."
5,Roald Dahl!,Bought this book for my nephew. I loved it as a child thought he would too. Nice and neat book.
5,Essential childhood reading,"This is where reading started for me, the book that first awakened me to the amazing potential of books. So when I read it to my 5 year old recently, I was delighted that the same magic happened for him. Dahl is the master of macabre and suspense, and this is nowhere better displayed than in Mr Fox.The story is quite short, at about 100 pages, so suitable for bedtime reading over a few nights. The only caution is that it does mention dying and killing and is not ideal for a very young audience as it is a little too scary."
5,Fantastic Mr. Fox,"I choose this rating because of all the excitement!!! -:)......... I would give this book as a title, scary excitementOr plain just Fantastic Mr. Fox"
4,Short but sweet,"This is a nice quality movie about Pope Benedict the XVI, nice introduction piece, short, but not too deep and does not cover too much on him, it would have been nice to see more videos as an introduction of his work as a theologian that would encourage more readings of his brilliant works."
2,Narrow and awkward,"I LOVE Steve Madden shoes (and own so many!) and have never had a problem with them for sizing. I generally wear a 6.5 or 7, but almost exclusively wear a 6.5 in Steve Maddens (their shoes tend to run big I think).These shoes do not fit true to width or size. I tried on both a 6.5 and 7 in these but could not comfortably get my foot to fit into either one. They don't look that narrow! The heel comes up really high and I tried all sorts of weird angles to get my foot in without the leather folding over to no avail. Maybe this is one of those out sourced ""supposedly"" name brand shoes. Who knows. I do not recommend."
3,"Okay for a ""Koskin"" case","I picked up one of these cases cheap on eBay as a replacement for the Targus CH045. The CH045 is a much better product, made with real leather. This case is made from ""Koskin,"" which feels like thin Naugahyde to me. The belt clip seems to be the same as the CH045, so it should work find for normal thickness belts--I've never had it fall off in five years of constant use.The case holds a Garmin iQue 3600 quite nicely; it could probably fit most PDAs, but being made of ""Koskin"" instead of leather, I wouldn't try forcing a PDA in it.However, the ""Koskin"" material is not as supple as real leather. The flap doesn't fold over the top as neatly as the leather version. I'm also concerned about the durability of ""Koskin."" Most references I find to this material are from manufacturers, who claim it to be ""durable and long lasting."" Time alone will tell..."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this because I was looking for a belt case to fit my new HP IPAQ 211. It does fit, but I'm not really too excited about it. I've been using Sena Cases up to this point and this $14 case is no match for a $50 case. That's obvious enough. Since currently Sena is not making a case for this and given the 200 series' large size, there's not much around so I thought I'd try this.The main issue with this product that led me to send it back is the construction of the belt clip. Obviously there's not a locking clip but the clip comes out a bit and then goes straight down. Nothing at all to provide resistance to pushing off. Aside from the design, the clip is pretty weak. I'm just not willing to trust a $450 PDA to what is really a poorly designed case."
2,Significant disappointment,"No longer has rotating belt clip like last model. After less than 3 months of use, lining is coming off. Terrible manufacturing quality!"
3,PDA Case,"I thought it would be better, easier to use, it turned out to be just a case, not a pda style case"
4,Does what it is suppose to do...,"I purchased this item due to my overwhelming ignorance. After buying my wife the Elura 100 DV camera from Canon I got this charger thinking I was being smart. The camara is it's own battery charger as it turns out, when you plug the guy in. Never-the-less, we use this charger because it is easier and less bulky ...and sure enough, it charges the battery just fine and dandy. Kudos to it for doing what it was designed to do... Now if only I was as smart..."
5,Great for Travel,I bought the Canon CG-300 charger for a trip to Europe. I have a Canon DC40 camcorder. It worked great! I was afraid of charging the camcorder battery directly (in the camcorder) due to the electrical voltage difference and liked having this option. It charged both my primary and back up battery quickly and I am very happy with my purchase.
3,Canon charger,canon video didn't come with charger so you must charge battery in camera. The charger is an optional accessory-definitely needed because you can't charge battery and use camcorder at the same time. I like a charged spare battery as a back up while traveling. not superfast
4,must have,"i drain my batt too fast, and i like having a spare on hand. I'd give it 5 stars if it wasnt as expensive as it is. in fact, i think this thing should come free with the extra battery:Canon BP-315 Battery Pack for Optura 600 & HV10 Camcorders"
3,Mini Cable,Have used this cable in the past with no ill effects. It hides beautifully and performs as well as I would expect it to. It is flexible enough to seamlessly fit around door molding and snugly between the carpet and the wall molding. Mine was about 35 feet long and works fine.
4,Good product,I've been using this product for several months and I have been happy with it except for it being slipperly on the stovetop.
5,Early Free Jazz from Overlooked Musician,"I would buy this over ""Abstract"" until they reissue that as well as the sound on ""Freeform"" is digitally remastered. Other than that they are both classics. Joe Harriott was closer to Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins than John Coltrane. However, he was not just imitating Ornette Coleman. He clearly had his own style. For a similar sounding recording a few years later, try ""Our Man in Jazz"" by Sonny Rollins (playing with Don Cherry and Billy Higgins from Ornette's classic line up) who also flirted with aspects of free jazz in the 60's. Thanks to a certain free jazz blog Destination-Out, Joe Harriott got the posthumous recognition he deserved and this album was reissued. Let's hope other unknown but classic free jazz artists get the same treatment."
2,Not quite what I expected,"This ball was smaller (only about 7"") than I anticipated and was not as dense as I had hoped. My grandson practices pitching against the stairs inside during the winter and I had hoped for more the regulation size ball. Also it is quite light so doesn't travel with much velocity.He has one from a couple years ago that is perfect for indoor use , but I have had a tough time finding one like it."
5,Fabulous debut.See where the great poet started!,This poetry is less compicated than Ms.Graham's newer poems.Though they still have that charm and profound ideas expressed in the most beautiful poetic language ever!Spring the few dollars for some poetic delight!
2,Another great Flame of Recca,"This is another great Flame of Recca book, but probably is more of a shonen story( more for boys then girls). Even though i am a girl i really like this story. I had no clue what i was buying when i first got this story, but it turned out to be pretty good.Rated older teen for languauge and brief nudity. But its really not that bad."
2,Tired Album,"I hate to say it, but this is the first album by them that I did not like. I did not think the intensity was there. I felt they were going through the motions on the songs. I would compare it to the Fear of the Dark album by Iron Maiden. Bruce Dickinson seemed bored with the album, just like Joacim Cans here. I do not feel a change in singer is needed for the group. Cans has a great and distinctive voice in the hard rock world. The two years off between studio albums should work wonders for the group. I really don't care what this group wears in the pictures. They can dress up like unicorns for all I care. As long as they rock, it is alright with me. I look forward to their new album coming out and I will go see them with Dio in the coming months. Hopefully, they will be supporting a stronger album than Renegade."
1,don't do it,this album is crap and i will not be going anywhere near anything else by them.some of the guitar is ok but the singing will keep you from appreciating anything on there.terrible stuff... the lyrics are woeful (& i used to play dungeons and dragons as a kid) and the actual singing is a terrible attempt to sound like bruce dickinson while suffering from an extreme case of having no talent.
2,Losing strenght....,"Well, I definitely prefer LEGACY OF KINGS and their debut, GLORY TO THE BRAVE, than this one here. ERven with master drummer Anders Johansson on board, this albumsounds tired and uninspired.I'm not accusing them if repetaing themselves (the cliched lyrics, the obligatory power ballad, etc, etc, etc...). It's just that it sounds tired."
2,GLORY TO THE BRAVE 3,"Renegade could be called GLORY TO THE BRAVE III, because, basically, all Hammerfall albums are exactly the same: cliched lyrics, the guys dressed like warriors, the obligatory obnoxious power ballads.The difference is that in RENEGADE they have a better line-up, including famous Swedish drummer Anders Johansson. The songs and production alsos are better than in their debut, GLORY TO THE BRAVE. But I think this band has nothing left to show their audience. Or they change a little bit or they dissapear."
4,What a band!!,"The best melodic power metal band, that's for sure. But can someone explain me why this obssession with templars, knights, whatever?? Can't they write about absolutely anything else??!!"
4,"Two steps forward, one step back","I managed to find this on a store shelf recently and I have had a hard time deciding how good this album actually is. At first it sounded a bit odd, nowhere near the instant hooks of Legacy of Kings. But then I started to realize that this is a bit more complex than what they usually do (contrary to at least one other review). This, I think, is the album's strongest point. It sounds to me as if they don't want to write the same album over and over. Some songs are exceptions, but overall, this shows that the band is still very viable and is not about to burn out.I must however point out that the lyrics really need work sometimes. They are well written at times, but too often deal with the same heavy metal brotherhood or fantasy themes that they sound somewhat uninspired. That, I think is the album's weakest point. If you can get over that (as a Dio fan, it doesn't get to me) then this album is bound to please."
5,When Hammerfall delivers you know ....,"This album gives you the impression that it was wrote in the `80 but its not ,the drums and the guitars are like you have never heard before .Renegade is one of the best ,the guitars are tight but precised and just hard stuff!When you hear this album this is one of their signature albums ,again one of the best ,this album is true Hammerfall in it ,I strongly recommend !"
4,THE BEST BAND,"HAMMERFALL is the best European power-metal band. Simply as that. Their three albums are amazing, just that. God, I love this band!! If only their lyrics were a littler better and dealed about different subjects..."
3,One of the few best seasons of the entertaining series,"Except poor transfer quality of the set (not better than your old VHS copies)this is the most gruesome, dark and most bloody season. What happened to those slick package designs of first two seasons? It doesn't even fit with others. Collector's nightmare... Grrrr...."
5,Third Times The Scream,the thid season of tales from the crypt rules. the crypt keeper is more hillarious than ever. i can't wait to see season four. if you have not seen this season yet then i recommend you do. the best episode on season three areEpisodes2. Carrion Death3. The Trap4. Abra Cadaver5. Top Billing6. Dead Wait8. Easel Kill Ya9. Undertaking Palor10. Mournin' Mess11. Split Second13. Spoiled
4,The Creeper Returns with a Vengence,"Fun, gore and more. A slew of stars both in front and behind the cameras add to the overall enjoyment of this third season. One episode alone, ""Yellow"" is worth the price with Robert Zemekis (Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit)directing legendary actor, Kirk Douglas, Eric Douglas (yes, Kirk's son), Dan Aykroyd and genre great Lance Henricksen."
4,what happened to to the picture quality!!!!!!,"i give the season four stars. but the dvds get 2 stars. what happend!!! The WB got cheap, the new package sucks its higher than the others and not the same inside. That i could handle, but what really sucks is that the picture quality looks like VHS!The first 2 seasons looked great. But the third looks like im actually watching them in 1991! In a way it feels old school, but dam we are in the dvd age and i wish they looked good like the first 2 seasons. i hope they go back to the old packaging and remastering in the 4th season!"
4,Learning Oracle Programming,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST WOMDERFUL BOOKS I HAVE COME AROSS IN A LOMG TIMEIT EXPLAINS ALL THE TOPICS WONDERFULLY ESPECIALLY WITH THE BEGINNER IN MIND
4,very user friendly...almost too much so.,"overall, the text does a good job of presenting the material. however, a larger selection of proofs is really necessary to challenge the reader. perhaps borrow another text from a library to get a larger amount of problems to work on. for other parts, the ideas are there, but some of the machinery is glossed over. like _really_ proving two groups/rings/other structures aren't isomorphic."
4,Cost Factor,"This is a good product and I bought it on line because none of the retail outlets in St Louis carry this (that I could find). The only problem is the cost.... not the cost of the product but the shipping. My cost for the product was $8, shipping was $5 and change. To be effective, you would have to buy a case, or whatever, which is discouraging."
5,Butler Gum Snap-On Proxabrush (Cylindrical),"These brushes are excellent for getting food between the teeth that a toothbrush doesn't get...even an electric one. Butler makes both the snap-on brushes and the brushes that go through a hole in the handle and are bent and held down. These are cheaper but the snap-on brushes are much, much better."
1,the item was fine..... amazon was extremely bad,"amazon shipped a $4.00 item by express mail, which i didn't want and charged me $20.00. when i was notified by amazon of how they were shipping and how much it would cost i immediately contacted amazon that was not what i wanted and please cancel the order. amazon didn't. in the past i have been impressed with amazon. not any more. my advise is to check other vendors before amazon."
3,This IS the remastered version!,"Thanks to Amazon's bizarre policy of blending reviews of different releases of the same film, you have to look extra hard to determine what posts are referring to what versions. The MGM dvd-r is a very nice remastered release, 16X9 anamorphic and no doubt looks as good as this film ever will (which technically is quite nice, actually). The controversy of dvd-r media aside, this is the one to get if you want the professional studio release."
3,"Good movie, not a remastered picture","My heading pretty much says it all, the sound is fine but the picture looks like one of the old rental syndications, grainy and old. No trailers or extras but that would be ok if the picture were better. Anyone know if the other versions have cleaned it up?"
3,Decent buy,"This book came to me in good condition, but to be honest, it doesnt fit my subject area, so its kind of useless for me. Im a math secondary ed major, and this book spends 80% of its time talking about literacy as in english type classes. But, the author does have some interesting strategies"
3,"fast out of the gate, but stumbles in the middle","Generally good material for the beginner & some even for the more advanced student. What I didn't like was the author's reliance upon so called ""new age"" terms & philosophy. The ""exercises"" I found especially weak & tending toward a new age ""anything goes"" approach. The author also seems to be fascinated by UFO's & psychic material, which to me seems far afield of alchemy. The bibliography contains much psychic claptrap as well, relying heavily upon ""alternative history"" titles. The author's website seems less inclined to the new age & psychic material."
3,The Emerald Tablet,"This has the best translation of the Emerald Tablet that I have found so far. It is based on several previous translations, not just one. This makes it easier to read than the traslation in the back od The Three Books of Occult Philosophy by Agrippa."
3,Alchemy goes Hollywood.,"It's a good start that gets it right in sections, falls short in several crucial areas.....and completely misses the point in others. For example, the hallucinatory section from page 255 pretty well goes against everything taught in alchemy schools. Those who seek out experiences will tend to seek out more such experiences rather than letting the alchemical process evolve naturally. This basic tenet that the adept is taught very early on is ignored, raised red flags straight away.Nevertheless, a good starting point that acts into a springboard into more measured and well researched works. Lots and lots of references."
4,"Inspired,insightful...truly alchemical!","This is a rare book combining knowledge with a hands on approach intending to initiate the reader into alchemy as a way of life.Very well researched, written and also 'experienced'-the author presents his own alchemical journey-it can also be a good starting point for those interested in pursuing further this fascinating topic.As for alchemy's relevance for our times,D.W.Hauck's 'The Emerald Tablet'provides a very strong case indeed."
5,Decaf Teas,This was a gift and the receiver just loves this product. She said that it is something new each day and wants it again for next Christmas!
2,Wrong Bulb,"Unlike the person who did the review in August, when I look at this product, I see the bulb with 4 tubes, which is what I need for my light. So I ordered it, and I got the long thin one with 2 tubes that the August reviewer had wanted. Annoying to say the least. To be fair, the item # on the box is the same one listed as the bulb for my light. It looks like they are both CFML36VLX. But, that's why I ordered the one with the picture of the bulb I needed."
1,Much cheaper alternatives,"This price is outrageous.It cost the same for me to go around the corner and buy a whole new generic floor lamp and buy a natural spectrum CFL bulb that fits any standard bulb socket.When my new bulb burns out, it will cost me only $5 to replace it."
4,good battery,"The battery was purchased over an year ago for my old toshiba..i moved on from it but it did do what it is meant to do..extended my portability because my old battery was fried and i wasn't able to surf on the go for more than 10 minutes(with my old one).The new one lasts me a little over 150 minutes when surfing and around 100 minutes when watching a movie..I am not a gamer so i can't tell you anything about that.The original battery was performing better when i bought the laptop but the price i paid(around 72 dollars if i remember correctly,it was over an year ago) it was the best viable choice.The Amazon delivery (free) was great, i got it 3 days later at a US address(5 stars for that).Only 4 stars though because I am pretty demanding and i rarely give 5.It is a good battery that will extend your mobility."
1,"Product appears to be correct, if only the shipping delivered it in one piece","Purchased this item in conjunction with the wiring harness and antenna adapter kits (sold separately). At first glance it appears to be correct and should work effectively but as my piece came in a few extra pieces I'm not sure yet.In general, the idea is that this slides into the dash opening and then you slide your stereo into the opening. Maybe the seller should put this in a box rather than an envelope because it has thin separation stems from the bottom to top of the unit that on mine were broken in transit (basic shipping was USPS).Complete installation of a new stereo requires these additional items:Stereo Wire Harness Ford Focus 00 01 02 03 04 (car radio wiring installation parts)Stereo ANTENNA Harness Ford Focus 00 01 02 03 04 (car radio wiring installation parts)"
2,Not very useful...,"This book attempts to describes Exchange 2000 features at a high level but doesn't really succeed. What it really describes is the technology that makes up Exchange 2000 but not in a way that would satisfy a technical audience. In the end the reader is left with jumbled descriptions of Active Directory, the Web Store, and various Internet protocols without a clear vision of what Exchange 2000 is all about. What's really missing here are discussions and examples of how all of this technology can actually benifit organizations and the users that they employ. Otherwise, this book only helps the reader become a little more 'buzzword' compliant."
3,Major Bias,"I was intrigued by the story, having attended high school in the Bay Area myself. The book really makes you appreciate the DLS program and their recent streak. That being said, there is a considerable bias present in this book. It is written almost in defense of the DLS program, rather than taking an outside view of whats been happening. When the issues of recruiting and ""stealing"" of players arise, the author takes a defensive posture, pleading the DLS case almost as if he is employed by the school. Perhaps, due in large part to his long-time coverage of DLS for the Contra Costa Times, the author has lost the ability to write an objective piece on the subject. Just a thought...Nice story though."
1,The secret is simple - RECRUIT,"It's really not such an amazing feat when you take it into account that De La Salle is the only local high school that actually RECRUITS football players. If they earned this record based on students in the area and NOT the recruitment efforts, or, if they played other schools that recruited players, THAT would be worth writing a book about. It's always rubbed me the wrong way that a high school team does this. Does De La Salle turn out amazing players? Definitely. The funny thing is though, most of them were already highly talented before they got there, which is WHY they got there."
2,Just Disappointing,"There is far too little new content in this book that will find use. There are some nice new powers, and the Lurk and Ardent are interesting. However, the feat section is simply pathetic compared to what you find in other books in the series. The included ""errata"" is unwelcome, not only because it is taking up page count, but because the major clarifications themselves (mindblades and astral constructs) both nerf existing classes and seem like the less likely reading from the original book. Implementing this book wholesale will probably have a net negative effect on your game. I do not recommend this book even to a completist. If you run a psionic campaign, this book might be useful for a handful of new ideas, but I would not pay even half the cover price for that content."
1,No reason for this book to exist...,"D&D/WOTC/Hasbro keep releasing 1 useless book after another. Here's the formula: reprint half old stuff from the old book, reprint stuff from Dragon/Dungeon/modules etc, add 30 pages of new garbage, repeat in 3 years...Psionics handbook 2001, Expanded Psionics handbook 2004, Complete Psionics 2006. Manual of the Planes and the Planar handbook...Complete Arcane, Complete Mage, etc, etc..."
3,Disappointment,"I used Polar heart watches for years (nearly 20 years!) but (a) the infrared transfer of data between computer and watch is unreliable and (b) Polar doesn't make software for Apple Macintosh. So I was seduced to buy this top-end Nike watch.The Nike software works on my Mac and the radio transfer works great (the pulsing blue receiver is cool, too!).So, what's the problem???The problem is that the Nike software is FAR more primitive than the Polar software. The watch can't track calorie burn, the graphing of data is extremely limited and, in general, the Polar software just provides a lot more exercise data, with more display options, than the Nike software.I wrote to Nike with this feedback but they didn't reply.The watch and the motion sensor work fine (the sensor is quite accurate). But if you are choosing between the top-end Polar and this Nike unit (and you are PC based, not Mac) go for the Polar watches."
3,NOT even remotely on par with Dead Can Dance!,"I purchased this at the behest of some of the reviewers here and I'm compelled to write my own review. Is it ""Transedental""? Sure. But so is a ""best o' Gregorian Chant"" album. Don't purchase this album expecting the same magic as the Lisa Gerrard/ Brendan Perry coupling, you'll be dissapointed. I'ts decent, mind you.. but lacks much of the rich texturing and crisp vocals of Dead can dance."
3,Really Like Taco and Chili Mix by this Company; Don't care for the Sloppy Joe mix,"If you are attempting to get someone to eat a little less meat with out them knowing, I would not make this mix my first attempt. I can tell straight away that Fantastic Foods Vegetarian Sloppy Joe Mix is made from soy. It has that distinct taste and texture, similar to meatless burgers, which I don't like. Attempting to hide that taste with BBQ sauce and cheese has not helped. The Taco and Chili mixes are far easier to cover up that taste and feel.I will not be purchasing this product again. If you want to give it a try, purchase a box locally, because if I had a pack of 12, 11 of them would be in the trash."
5,MMM MMM Good,"Got my shipment today, so I went to the store to buy hamburger buns, tomato paste, and onions. Super easy and quick to make. It tasted awesome, the first sloppy joe I have had in years since I became a vegetarian. In the directions it says to add 1 tablespoon of oil but I forgot to put it in. It tasted great and when I make it in the future I won't be adding any oil. The texture is really surprisingly good for not having meat in it. Thumbs up."
5,headphones,"Very pleased with how quickly Amazon got me this product for my daughter, she absolutely loves them"
2,you get what you pay,"These are one of the worst headphones on the market. I bought them for two reasons:1. My Phillips headphones worned out. Had them for 6 years or so and they perform much better than these Sony.2. Needed to add something cheap to my shopping cart so I could get free shipping on my order :)If you are going to use them for jogging on the streets, you might have a hard time hearing your music because of the traffic noise.They sit comfortably on your ears, however, the sound quality is terrible. Would not recommend them to anybody."
4,great headphones for running/working out!,i love these headphones. i am very hard on my headphones with running and working out. these have great sound quality and have held up well so far. i like the behind the head band with little lips that keep them snug around my ears. hard to find headphones i can actually run with but these work!
4,I like the style and they stay put.,"I really like the style of these headphones. I bought them for jogging and they stay put. They look a little strange but they fit nicely around my head and are comfortable. I only use them for about 30 minutes at a time, but I haven't had any issue with the comfort. As far as the sound quality, they sound good to me and are much better than what I was using before (Brookstone earbuds-awful). I definitely recommend these."
2,Two ears are better than one,"I bought these headphones about 4 months ago. I was very happy when I first got them since they were super-comfy and didn't get in the way while excercising. The sound was pretty decent for the price-range, and overall, they seemed pretty sturdy. Unfortunately, yesterday the right ear conked out and no longer outputs sound. I went to Sony's website to diagnose the problem and their solution was to replace the headphones. Naturally, I'm just outside of the warranty period. I would almost buy a new pair if I thought they would last longer than a few months. I really didn'[t do anything wierd with them, so I'm not sure what went wrong. Maybe it's an isolated incident, but still worth considering before buying these headphones."
2,Not for the $,"I am disappointed by the sound quality offered by these headphones. Not only do they hurt your ears after wearing them for about 30minutes but sound like they should be $10 headphones.I feel like I paid for the Sony name and a flashy design.Some things I did buy them for, but I figured they'd have at least as much bass as my freebie sonys that came with my walkman years ago. Otherwise the sound is OK, too much high and decent midrange. Nothing spectacular here.I will say that this style of headphone is about the best thing out there for any excercise routine.I'm usually a Sony fan too, everything I own is sony.But unfortunately I shouldve gone with Koss in this department, they make behind the neck headphones also, and will in the future."
2,Worked well...but not for long.,"I had the predecessor model to these headphones for 7 years until they finally gave out last year. After tons of use and many miles of running, I felt that those were a great value, plus they sounded decent.When I went to purchase the same model, I found that they had changed slightly to this newer version. The design was identical so I went bought them. Sadly, Sony's build quality which I thought was wonderful, is not up to par on these headphones. Yesterday after 8 months of ownership, these headphone stopped working. The right side speaker no longer functioned and slightly twisting the speaker brought the sound back momentarily. By the end of my run, the right side speaker was completely dead.Now I see that Sony no longer sells this style of headphone. I guess it's time to move on to a different brand."
2,Right earphone died in a year,"I purchased this item 3 years ago and the right earphone died in a year. Also, My ears hurt a lot, after continuous use of a couple of hours. I recommend logitech products instead of this."
2,Broke within 3 months,"These are great headphones, but after only 3 months of use the right speaker kicked out on me."
4,Tight,Sound is good. The only thing which I don't like it's tight. May be it fits better for other people heads.
4,Foam replacement,"I've owned these headphones for years. The foam pads have needed to be changed for quite some time, but I never knew where to get replacement foam pads. The sound quality on these headphones is still good so I didn't want to get rid of them. I looked online for replacement headphones and found they charge $15.95 a piece or as little as $2.95, plus shipping. I suggest you check your local dollar store for cheapy knock off headphones that look like the style of the Sony Headphones and take the foam pads off of them. Worked for me.Pro's: I like the bass of these headphones, but they're not as loud as my Sony earbuds even with the volume turned up all the way. Gold plated connector.Con's: I would have said the foam pads, but since I resolved that issue, my only complaint would be they get uncomfortable to wear if you're wearing eye glasses."
1,Basically worthless.,"I have foolishly bought about 3 of these, at various times. Each and every one of them died on me and my wife, within a few months of use. One went out within a month.Quality control is non-existent. We didn't use it rough, just the normal gym use, which is what it is advertised for.Never again. Sony, when you decide to make things cheaply, remember, it is the same name on an expensive camera as well as a $30 headphones. You lose a bit of your shine each time.I am looking at Sennheiser, Panasonic, etc now."
2,Comfortless headphones,"I don't consider myself to have a extra big neck or head, in fact I'm just an adult male of normal neck & head size. I can barely get these on my ears. If I tilt my head up, it feels as if they are going to pull off. I'm going to cut the neck band in the middle & tape it back together, adding about an inch to the lenght. That should give enough room to move my head while using them. The sound is good, but not great. I can only use them with my portable cd player. The cord won't reach the computer unless I sit the tower in my lap. A very unsatisfactory purchase. I'm stretching it with 2 stars."
4,Great for running...,"I love listening to music while either running on the treadmill or on the streets. While these headphones are not going to be known for an amazing bass sound quality, they get the job done for a workout. They are comfy, light, and stay fitted during my runs all while providing decent sound quality. I even use them during 5, 8, and 10k event runs. Since I don't like the way ear bugs feel in my ear, these are a great fit for me!"
1,Fragile and uncomfortable.,"I am really not too impressed. I had these for about six months before they developed a short in the wire leading up to the headphones. So they did not really last all that long. And they are frankly a bit uncomfortable, so wearing them for longer than an hour is painful.The Phillips Sport headphones are MUCH better. I have two pairs of these, and have worn one pair for over a year. No problems and very comfortable."
1,Terrible Quality,"I purchased these headphones on Oct.09.09 got up this morning to goto the gym and the left side stopped working, Nov.26.09. DO NOT BUY, SONY JUNK"
5,Great for running,I owned these headphones for 3 years and logged hundreds of miles running and training for marathons. I ran in the rain and sweated gallons on them. When the earpads finally wore out I did like another reviewer and found a cheap pair of replacements. They finally died and I replaced them with a different pair of Sony's. The bass and depth was no where as good. I will replace with my second pair.The fit is much better than any in ear designs I've tried. The behind the neck design stays out of the way if I wear a hat.
2,"Perfect fit, didn't last more than a month or two","These were great while they lasted, but the cord started having connectivity issues after only a few weeks. Unlike the Philips Rich Bass Neckband Headphone, these do not have an extra protective string to absorb the weight of the cord when you run so it pulls on where the cord connects to the headphones directly which is probably why they broke down so quickly. I use Philips Rich Bass Neckband Headphone now but if they came out with a version of these that had the protective string I'd probably go back to these instead."
3,headphones,Sound was good but too hot on the ears for exercising in the gym. I switched to the in ear headphones.
2,"Hurts your ears, sound is good","I got these to try and kill my hearing more slowly than earbud headphones, but these headphones are really uncomfortable. After about a half hour of wearing them, I get a headache because they are pushing into the back part of my ears. Maybe I just have a weird-shaped head, but try and look somewhere else for headphones tat won't cause you physical pain."
4,Good workout headphones,"I use this primarily for running, workout or doing the dishes- it's light enough and water resistant, which makes it perfect for such purposes. However, like all behind ear headphones, they don't really block out noise that well, so take that into your consideration. As a Sony product headphone, the bass is quite good, though it can be a bit too much sometimes in my opinion. It can get a bit too snug too; I find myself readjusting them or taking them out every hour or so. Sound quality is not mind-blowing, but definitely solid for the price range.Cord length is adequate for workout- a bit longer than I would like, but better than being short. For the record, I'm about five nine.In short, you will be hard pressed to find a better workout headphone for the money."
4,Sony MDR-G57G S2 Sports Street Style Headphones Review,"The headphones are more comfortable than the previous models. The product also comes with an extra set of foam covers as well. If you use these when running or working out, the extra foam covers do come in handy. The reflective piece is more orange in color than yellow, but no matter. They still look good. I would recommend these to a friend as well."
4,Just as expected,"The head phones are fine. If you want to wear them all day long, I wouldn't get them. I use them to work out in and they are fine. I think they would get uncomfortable if worn for a long time. The fidelity is good. I bought them because of the price and I have been happy with them."
4,Sony Headphones,"The sound quality is wonderful for the price... It grips my head very firmly which is good (in the sense that on runs I don't need to worry about them slipping) but can be uncomfortable for long periods of time (say, listening to music at work all day). However, overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product."
2,"Great, until the Right ear went out...","I recieved these headphones for Christmas this past year and have been using them approximately 5 times a week ever since, primarily for working out. I can't use the ear bud headphones, so I picked these out. Initiatlly I was so excited about how great the sound quality was, although there was soreness around the back of my ear when I first began using them. 2 weeks ago while running the right speaker went out and that's the end of them.Has anyone had this happen to them?I'm not sure if I'll invest in this model for replacing them...any suggestions?"
2,Foam Earpieces Wear Out Quickly,"This is my 2nd pair of these headphones, on my first pair the foam ear pieces wore out, and since these are Sony, their are no replacements for them. So I bought a brand new set of headphones and now these ear pieces have worn out. They lasted about a year each time. I'm going to try the Jensen behind the ear headphones this time and see if the foam lasts longer."
5,Great headphones but I question the price,"Amazon just flagged me that I never reviewed this item I bought a couple of years ago. When I clicked on ""review the item"" I thought Amazon was wrong because of the price of them, I would NEVER pay anything close to $100 (or more) for headphones! Thank goodness Amazon keeps your purchase history because I clicked on mine and found that I paid just under $26 for these. They worked great until they were mysteriously lost somewhere. I would love another pair but if they've gone up in price that much then forget it. But for what it's worth, they were comfortable and worked great."
1,Bought two - right side went out on both after about 6 months,"Tried two of these and they both broke in the connection to the right ear piece. There is definately a design flaw. Fits kinda tight, too. Moving on to a different brand."
1,Worthless a couple months,"Right ear stopped working after only a couple months. They lasted just long enough to make it past the return window, now they're worthless. Don't buy."
1,Broke after 2 weeks,"I've had these headphones for about 2 weeks. I purchased them for running, as they are called sports, water resistant, headphones. No sound is coming out of the right ear after only a few uses. I took good care of them, and after each use I cleaned them off with a paper towel.Also, they squeeze the hell out of the area around your ears, and will give you a headache with prolonged use. I wear a 7 1/2 hat size, so it's not like my head is enormous.Sony makes garbage.Buy their equipment at your own risk."
4,"Had them for 6 years, and still working fine.","I'm going to keep this review vary simple. The comfort I think depends greatly on how your ears are located on your head, for me they are pretty comfortable. Also them little things that keep them on your ears tare them off (like everyone has done with this type of head phone), ""they"" are what's uncomfortable. Sound quality is perfectly acceptable for ""new music"" at this price. I mean I don't care how good your head phones or speaker are if the source is crap your going to hear crap. Light weight and don't want to move around any while on your head but not so much if you want to sit back and relax.I got them for computer use and they lasted 6 years now, the foam has even come off of them and they are still comfortable (sort of...). For around $20 that's pretty dang good in my book."
4,Sports Style headphone,"Well the purchase is worth the money, I enjoyed using it and use it extensively in gym.the only issue it gives some times that it is little tight on ears."
1,Instrument of Torture,"I would rate these headphones a zero, but they actually transmit sound, so I guess I can't.First, I had to crank my Sansa Clip to the maximum so I could hear music at a reasonable level, compared to my current over-the-ear ear clips.More importantly, after 1-1/2 hours in the gym, I could not wait to rip them off my ears - I was so much in pain.Every head movement twisted these headphones, inducing another wave of pain. I must have looked like a zombie, trying not to move my head to limit the pain.I cannot understand how anyone could wear these. I guess my ears must be deformed.I guess I learned my lesson to stay away from this headphone design in the future."
4,Love the sound; hatet he ear-cushions,The sound on these are excellent; the only problem is the fact that after a few months the ear-cushions wear away. These come with an additional pair but it would be nice if the integrity of the ear cushions were of better quality/a fabric of better integrity to begin with.
5,Love these head phones,"love these headphones .. i found they have alot better bass if you take off the foam pads . love this headset with my new Coby MP-600 mp3 player , amazing sound in a small package. to have music anywhere on demand that will play and play and play is so nice .. that mp3 player lasts like 25 hrs i swear . awsome combohave loved sony audio products for some time now .. and theres GOOD reason .. Sonys rock plain and simple .. top of the line audio sound at affordable prices."
3,An ok product,"I wear my headphones about 8 hours per day and am constantly taking them on and off. As a result, they only lasted about 2 years. The sound quality was great at first, but significantly declined after about a year. I've had to turn the volume up full blast to hear my podcasts. When I listened to music, the vocals were harder to hear than the music. Yes, the ears pinch a little bit at first, but they loosen up after a while and are actually really comfortable.If you need a simple pair of behind-the-neck headphones for occasional use, these are great. If you need a more durable pair of headphones, keep looking."
3,Pretty decent headphones,"I bought these when the speaker in my Philips Behind-the-Ear Sport Headphones died after using for about 3 yrs. The Philips were out of stock at Target, I originally bought those at Best Buy, but they don't carry them anymore. This type of product seems to come and go more than anything I have known. Trying to find the exact same model a couple of yrs later seems nearly impossible.I researched a little and found these here at Amazon. They work OK, but the loudness is not as high as the Phillips and they begin to get uncomfortable on my ears after about 45 min of exercising. They stay on OK, but just not as comfortable as the Philips. Also the cord is very long and does not use the type of elastic that the Philips uses, so it requires you to wind around the iPod many times.Overall decent but not as comfortable or as easy to use as the Philips. When these die I will try to go back to Philips Behind-the-Ear Sport Headphones if they are still made."
4,headphone review,Sony makes excellent 'phones in general for multipurpose use. I use these at the gym and they give great sound in an environment with a lot of background noise/?music.
2,I wish I'd kept looking.,"I was excited to use these headphones for jogging since earbuds don't stay in my ears very well. These headphones do stay in place, but after about 20 minutes of wear, they become very uncomfortable. Also, they do not cancel outside noise at all; if the gym is busy, I have to crank the volume on my iPod. I think I'll try a set of earbuds w/ an attached headband. Too bad I wasted 20 bucks on these though."
3,"Quality is fine, but uncomfortable.","While the quality of these earphones is alright for the money, they can be extremely uncomfortable. There is no level of adjustment. This caused me some soreness. Admittedly I have a big head, but every other pair of headphones I've owned have allowed for at least a little adjustment, but these do not. So those with large craniums should beware."
5,Use of MDR-G57G S2 Headphones,Have been using this product while running or walking for years. Great sound for the money with an IPod. Stays put and keeps my ears warm in the winter. Recently broke old pair (my fault) and only wanted same exact one to replace it. Bought two just in case.
2,These headphones will break,"I've had two pairs of these headphones. Within a month or so of buying them, I lost sound in one of the earpieces (sound would only come out of the other one). It's too bad because these are otherwise fairly comfortable headphones."
2,Nice Design but...,"These headphones a good, but not great, or even really good... just 'good'. The design is actually the best part. They are by far the most comfortable wrap-around headphones I have ever tried on. They are especially nice when working out, as they do not slip at all.Bass - Weak. Very, very weak.Trebel - Too strong actually, and not very good to boot. The trebel lines in music drown out all the other sounds. On songs that have particularly high or loud trebel sounds, it is almost painful to listen to.Vocals - Not anything special.For the price, they are horrible. You do not get your money's worth. The sound is iffy, and the design is good. The koss KSC-50 sport ear-clip headphones (or the KSC-55, wrap-around) have twice the sound quality of these, and are much more bang for your buck.Overall, these headphones aren't worth your money."
2,Short out,"After 4 months of use, less than 1 hour per day, the cord developed a short. The sound was great while it lasted. The behind the ear support took a while to get used to."
4,Good headphones for the price,"I read all the previous review before purchasing the MDR-G57G S2 headphones. One reviewer suggested removing the removable plastic clips to make them more comfortable. I tried this and found them far less comfortable so I put the clips back. The clips seem to take some of the pressure off the back of the ears. I also found that when the headphones started to hurt, I could simply lift the phones upward and they wouldn't hurt for a while.Another reviewer suggested there are 2 different models: The MDR-G572 and the MDR-G572 S2. I believe they are one and the same.I use them for jogging and for listening to TV on the treadmill. The sound is great for sport type headphones and I have been very happy with them."
1,Failed in Two Weeks,The Colorite hose cannot stand up to pressure. After two weeks occasional use with pistol grip valve the hose split near male end. Very cheap hose material.
2,Only for the true Numan fans,"I was not very impressed with the album as a whole. I only bought it for the Numan tracks, which are very 80's pop. Not new wave. It is worth buying if you collect Numan's music, but not if you are looking for an album to listen to."
3,Numan a'la British pop,"OK, so it's been over a decade since I've heard the EP -- to be honest, I'm not sure there was ever an actual album. What I do recall is Gary doing a standard pop tune, complete with a catchy chorus with a female vocal backing him up. So, my review is this: if you are a bigtime Numan collector, collect. If not, you're looking at paying a lot for this--- album? or EP. What a horrible critic I am, someone please post some more info on this."
1,I Deleted This Book After The 3rd Chapter,"There are a lot of folks that would more than likely enjoy this type of writing, unfortunately, I do not. There was too much detailed talking. If you ever read one of the ""Preacher"" stories you will understand why this book did not appeal to me."
1,Not a reliable seller,"Didn't receive book in time for classes to start, then never received information weather it was cancelled like I had asked."
4,As expected,Book was shipped in a timely manner and was exactly as expected. Will order again if the need arises in the future.
5,Great Product,I received the book in a like new condition and it came with the CD I didn't expect to receive. I was very happy to get the book before the start of class.
5,Excellent for Statistical Understanding,I am a Kaplan Univ student and this book was a plus when I took Statistics. It was available via ebook from school but having the text was better as I was able to flip back and forth and that helped me understand the processes better. I highly recommend this book for any student taking Statistics. It also has the Z scores and T charts in the Appendix and is great for use in chapters 6-conclusion
3,Peeling/flacking after only a few months,"Applied this to a porch after carefully following all the cleaning instructions. Unfortunately, after only about 6 months, it is already peeling in rather large areas. We scrubbed with the included cleaner beyond what was recommended to avoid this, but it apparently did not work. This was applied to a concrete porch (covered porch) that is about 48 years old...not sure if that has anything to do with it. Doing the math, it is a very expensive temporary application."
3,Rust-Oleum Stain Kit,"This was the perfect solution to spruce up our concrete patio, which had never been sealed, and was quite dingy. We liked the idea of the kit, which included very clear instructions on DVD. It should have been a very simple straight forward process. The stain, however, must have been on the shelf too long as we were constantly clearing the clogged tip. I'd highly recommend straining the stain before using. In the end the patio looks wonderful. It just took quite a bit longer to complete, due to the sediment in the stain."
4,"easy to apply, looks very nice","We prepped by pressure-washing the patio. It's a pretty rough, porous concrete. Easy to apply and the color looks great. As others have noted, this is more of a paint, not a stain. It has been on for roughly 8 months and still looks good. We had a couple of spots where the stain came up, but we quickly discovered that it was due to a chair with soft rubber feet. In the heat of the summer, the rubber ""melted"" and adhered to the top coat of the stain, ultimately lifting it. We have had no problems since, even with harder chairs ""scraping"" across it frequently."
2,Not worth it,"The stain was very thin and didn't adhere to the garage floor. I spent several hours preparing the surface according to the directions, but it still didn't work well. The sprayer would frequently clog and drip, creating blotches of stain. Instead of a nice even coverage, it looks like someone threw up stain all of over the floor. I'll likely redo the floor with another product in the spring, when the weather gets better."
2,Know What You're Getting,"I purchased the kit to stain my concrete basement floor. It is essentially a thin paint that was not absorbed by the concrete. An entire section peeled up 24 hours after I finished the floor. In other places, chipping has already begun. This project is less than 1 month old. I would not recomemend this product for any concrete project that is not highly porous. I say this because there are places where the stain went on the unfinished cinder block wall when I was spraying, and the stain looks like it adhere & absorbed well. One person who looked at the part that peeled said, ""You bought a product for concrete from a company that doesn't specialize in concrete."" I wish I would have talked to him month ago."
1,It is a paint no a stain,Was expecting this to be easier to use. The sprayer constantly clogged and I ended up uneven blotches all over the place.I lost my money because I had to remove the paint.
4,Concise Chess Endings,'Concise Chess Endings' is a small book (about CD size) that gives a clear and informative introduction to the endgame. It looks at endgames with a variety of piece combinations and explores the ways to achieve checkmate. The examples are clear to read and follow and the board diagrams are uncluttered. This is perfect to slip into your pocket and peruse when you have a spare few minutes on the train or when out and about. A useful early additional to your chess book library.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1,Bushnell Didital Binoculars,The quality of the digital pictures are poor at best. One must hold the binoculars perfectly still to get a decent shot. What you see through the binoculars is not in alignment with the digital camera.
1,Miserable,I don't like this product. It is hard to focus and once done the focus does not translate to the picture. It appears that they don't share the same optics. I should have trusted my doubts about the product.
2,Review of Techcraft BEL410B,This product looks great from a distance and also is easy to put together. However they had the right idea but the craftsmanship is not good at all. I opened the box to find hardware missing. When i dug further into the box for the glass peices the aluminum mount that was appoxied to the top glass pane was broke off. This whole stand is based off the base mounts and with that one broke it made the stand useless. The threads seemed to be loose and the aluminum needed more attention to detail as far as polishing and cleaning i also found some metal shavings from the machining process still in the aluminum mounts.
1,Do Your TV a Favor. Do Not Buy This product,"If you are considering TechCraft products, Please READ THIS.I bought a TechCraft TV Stand for my 73-inch TV on Dec 6, 2007.On June 8, 2012, the top glass shattered into thousands of pieces for no apparent reason, causing my TV to fell to the floor.The company do admit glass do sometime shatter, but they refuse to pay for any damages. They even request that I pay and order a replacement glass. So do your TV a favor, Do NOT buy any product from TechCraft!See Pictures here:[...]"
4,Great Modern Sleek TV Stand,"I took one star off because one of the back braces (on bottom shelf) come loose. After further inspection, I realized the piece was ""glued"" on the glass shelf and just...popped off..?? It is hard to describe this unless you put one of these together.The counter measure was just put all of the stand together and the brace actually is sturdy. No harm I guess.The TV stand is easy to assemble compared to the others on the market. The quality is excellent and I love the gun metal finish on the poles. I'm easily recommending this if you are looking for something modern, easy setup and does it's job. I have a 60"" Samsung ES7100 and it looks perfect. Be careful and distribute any heavier audio gear to the sides for better support. Keep the lighter weight components in the middle. A piece of glass this long has the tendency to bow if you're not careful."
5,Techcraft BEL501B 50-inch Wide Home Theater Stand (Black),"Best-built, best-looking TV stand on the market and the 3/8 inch thick tempered glass is the icing on the cake. Well written istructions make assembly a breeze. You can end your search right here!"
4,"I am still deciding, but my daughter gives it 4 stars!","I bought this table a couple of months early, the manufacturer has a suggested age of 12+ months and my daughter is ten months. BUT, she absolutely LOVES activity boards and tables and this one is no exception. There are a couple of activities for an older child and a few age-indifferent games. This table is VERY light and short. My daughter actually glides it around the rug. At least when it falls it's too light to do any damage. The piano keys are tiny compared to other tables out recently, but it plays like a piano and it has an action/reaction exercise with a steering wheel. When she moves the wheel a little character in a car moves. My daughter loves it."
2,Did nothing for me,"I'm a vitamin person but I find that these capsules did nothing for me. I've learned that some varieties of vitamins can take about thirty days in your system before you can see or feel any results. I completed sixty days and I got nothing out of these. I've tried other Ginkgo and it has done nothing for me, so maybe it's just that ginkgo has no effect on me."
1,Not a single benefit to this nearsighted customer,"I took the entire bottle and saw not one single change. Needless to say, I am not buying it again! Maybe it is for people with less severe eye problem like the lucky 20/20 who suddenly are having a bit of an eye problem!"
4,serving it's purpose,My massage chair fits in it easily. looks of room. I use it all the time and it works well.
1,not all massage chairs,The description on this says it fits all massage chairs but it did not fit mine. I have the Earthlite Vortex and it does not fit!!!!!!
1,Broken Wheel After Just 1 Use,The bloody wheel broke after just one use. Pitiful. Will returning item. The case itself is nice. Just what you need as a therapist but the desigb of the wheel hub needs to be metal not hard plastic.
3,Mediocre but necessary...,"This carrying case came with the massage chair that I originally ordered from Amazon in 2007. I've had to buy another case as the first one's wheel casing cracked. The same thing has happened to the second one that I bought in April 2009. I've had to epoxy the casing so that the wheel doesn't fall off again. Aside from the wheel inconvenience, it is one of the better massage chair cases out there. It has a large pocket in front that is convenient for supplies."
3,Mediocre but Good,"Now, to be honest. I really like Avantasia. I had never listened to Edguy before this... nor have I ever listened to any other metal opera. So... That puts me behind a few miles. Anyway, the lyrics are hopeful (as stated before), the musicians are skilled, but I have to agree with some that this is quite cliched. Not to mention, people who aren't familiar with Tobias Sammet's style of singing may definitely dislike this album. The music can get annoying, but I really enjoy a few of the songs. Still, I listen to Avantasia every other few days and I enjoy the songs. A good power metal opera for those who aren't too familiar with metal. However, I do like Part II better than Part I."
2,A lot of cliches,"This ambitious project by Edguy's talented singer, Tobias Sammet, just backfired, in my opinion. It has absolutely NO inovation, and, still worst than that, it seems to put the together all the available cliches of German power / melodic metal in just one CD. It's almost unbearable at certain parts. Of course all the musicians involved are very skillfull, but that did not save the album. THe term ""metal opera"" is wasted here. Trust me, it's just another power metal record: double kick drums all along, screaming vocals, hopeful lyrics, harmonic solos. It's pleasant, but, like I said before, just a copy from another copy."
3,THESE SUCK !!,"i bought 3 just to try them out. i was reluctant, because i believe you get what you pay for. but sometimes there is an exception. 2 of the batteries will not hold a charge more than a couple of days and the life is not even close to the sony brand. i have to recharge the batteries right before i use them and only keep them as a spare. as for the third it will charge but the battery is not recognized by the camera. an experiment, but never again.would not let me give it zero stars."
2,Not a good battery.,"After 18 month, the battery fail to keep charge. I don't even use the camera much."
1,Pesima calidad,"Recibi el estuche apenas hace 15 dias y esta descocido por los costados de la tapa. Para ser un producto de HP, deja mucho que desear.Estoy iniciando el proceso para su devolucion."
5,A must read for every violinist and luthier!,"This book contains the most important physical aspects of how a violin works, in a format you wont need a Ph.D. to understand. While ""The Physics of the Violin"" is a more complete reference, this manuscript does a better job of putting the physical principles in the contexts of musicians and luthiers. I recommend it to every violinist, especially those who like to tinker with their instrument!"
3,Um...,"So I thought I already knew what was going on with music and physics, but now I know less than I did when I started this book. Since most music physics books use the violin as an example, you can get this information cheaper and presented in a more organized fashion elsewhere (I will not shamelessly promote any author here). It seems to be a case of, ""this is this, and that is that, but not when this is something else..."" etc.BUT this would make a good book for an aspiring string player who wants to know the ""how"" of the instrument without understanding too much about the ""why"".So basically, if you are a physicist, this book is a no. You'll see why when you read the free sample.snore."
3,Explained but poorly illustrated.,"I found the author to be very knowledgeable,but his verbal descriptions with a minimum of illustrations,makes getting his point very tedious and labor-some.As a Product Development Engineer, I recognize the valueof concepts explained with meaningful words and welldetailed illustrations. This book lacks the latter."
5,The Best Dictionary of Mathematics I Know Of,"The thoroughness of this dictionary makes it great both for browsers like me and for real mathematicians. I can't imagine anyone outgrowing this work. If anything better comes along to take this book's place, odds are it will be the next edition."
2,This seems obsolete,"The same authors are listed for theCollins Web-Linked Dictionary of Mathematics, 2nd, 2002/2005,which I chose instead.Likely the same book, but improved."
5,Fun and entertaining,This is a good episode. Ted Raimi is the guest star and does a great job. Richard has a few new moves with the sword. He can stop bolts with it and he can twirl it like a pro. The twirl with his jump looks really awesome. It isn't my favorite episode but I enjoy watching it.
5,It takes you by the heart,"Legend of the Seeker is one of those shows that captivates its viewers from the very beginning. The cinematography is stunning! The chase scene and the incredible costumes help to establish that this show is anything but ordinary.The viewers are instantly captivated by the stunning woman in white being chased by an army of men. This episode is the perfect beginning to an incredible tale of love, courage, struggle, and forgiveness. Plus there is some eye candy (Richard shirtless chopping wood). This show is a must watch! If you are not convinced by this review, then go and watch the first episode because there are no words to describe the magic that this show possess"
4,Great Show!!,"If you like wizards, witches and knights, then this is the show for you. There is even some hand to hand fighting thrown in for good measure."
5,Amazing show,"This is an excellent series in every measurable way, especially for a fantasy-action TV series based off very complex books. Its sad that there is only 2 seasons but theirs a good amount of people both working on that fans and famous individuals alike. SO have hope people and we will see some of this Kiwi actors on the screen again! Also as a final thought I think the reason this show failed was its reliance on Craig Horner, the seeker is like the doctor from doctor who the body and personality changes, your supposed to get attached to the ideal as well as the character and if they switched up the seeker maybe the show would of worked better? I dunno just a thought. Enjoy the 2 seasons that are here tho watch it in high def cause you can!"
4,Good fun and fantasy,"There isn't a whole lot of fantasy material out there, especially since Merlin seems to have run its course. But it's nice to see Legend of the Seeker carrying on for at least another season. The first season got better as it went on, and seemed to follow the books more. But having only read the first few books, I'm not that bothered. All book to TV or film translations change so it's no use comparing. What you have on the screen is entertaining, nice to look at and well written. The lineage of writers is quite strong, with Mike Sussman, Ken Biller and Andre Bormanis so you know it will at least be interesting. Can't wait for season 2, with Charisma Carpenter and Jolene Blalock appearing. Charisma was on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, and Jolene was on Star Trek: Enterprise. Nice to see some stunt casting. I think the first season saw a lot of local talent, but few big names. I look forward to filling in some of the gaps from the first season with this box."
3,sword of truth,No where near as good as the sword of truth books but still entertaining to watch. They changed the plot and story lines way too much. Still I am happy with the purchase.
3,Good standalone series,"After having read Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, I decided to check out the TV adaptation, Legend of the Seeker.If you've read the books, skip the show. It would probably be decent by itself, but it's an 'interpretation' as opposed to an 'adaptation' -- beyond the character names and locations, there is not much else similar to the Midlands we know and love."
1,"Books are amazing, TV series is horrible","One of the worst adaptations of a book series I've ever seen. If the director or writer could change something important in the book, they did. Even from the minute Richard walks on the screen, he's wrong. He's supposed to be a powerful, strong woodsman and not some scrawny short guy who looks like he's 12. The casting of Zed too is wrong (with Kahlan they did a little better), which detracted from my enjoyment of the series in a big way. Thank God a friend lent it to me so I didn't buy it as I'd be really upset if I'd actually spent money on this. Terry Goodkind must have been incredibly disappointed with this series after holding out so long to get it made the way HE wanted it. This isn't anywhere close to his vision of the books - absolute schlock! Wish I could have given it ZERO stars!"
4,Really Entertaining,"I was browsing through things to watch on Netflix when I stumbled on this show. I was expecting something really cheesy like Xena or Hercules but was pleasantly surprised. I had just planned on watching one episode before bed but ended up watching three.There is some cheese factor, it is a TV show fantasy after all, but it wasn't enough to be distracting. A lot of the ""secrets"" were pretty obvious but when they were revealed I still found it exciting to see how the characters would react to the newfound knowledge.I can understand why fans of the book may be disappointed the show didn't stick more closely to the original story line but I think it's unfair to call the show total trash just because of that. For the people who disliked the books for reasons such as poor writing, detestable main characters, or gratuitous amounts of rape and torture you may find the show to be an improvement."
5,Loved it!,"This show is awesome! I watched the entire first season in only a few days. The characters are amazing, and the special effects are quite good for a TV show. I'm scared to watch the second season because the first was so good."
3,Legend of the Seeker,The product was shipped quickly and arrived before the expected time frame given. The show ended up being really good and I highly recommend it for fans of the book series or non-fans.
1,Something with the potential to be good went wrong!,"I had never heard of this program or the book on which it is supposedly based. I came across it while wandering through the TV programs section. While I did not read the reviews, I did read the background to the story and told myself, why not? I watched the extended first episode of the first series and I was rather impressed. It had all the makings of leading in to a good series. Unfortunately, I then watched episode 2 and any thought of this becoming a good series went out the window. However, not being one to give up easily, I also watched episode 3 and by the end of that, I had seen enough. The dialogue was childish, the actors ""over acted"" frequently and not even the poorly executed ""slo mo"" fight scenes were going to save this program. Like I said, ""in the beginning"" it had the potential of making a good series. Perhaps the makers of this program should have just left the first extended episode as a TV mini-movie and left it at that."
3,Fantasy TV still needs work,"Well - I held in my hands the Legend of the Seeker. What did I find Xena or Hercules meets Matrix and Star Wars. The ideas are there, the background superb, and the costumes not bad. Then came the acting. Unlike some who comment, let us really look at the acting. There is promise, but the dialog leaves much to be desired. Zed is a standout. But so much is needed. In a time when other better written Sci-Fi suffers from cuts, we still have the curse that Fantasy has a problem on TV. Xena and Hercules show that a tongue-in-cheek attitude can win over a lack of consistent dialog. The curse of Fantasy on TV continues. The answer is still out there...somewhere."
3,watered down,"I am a fan of the books. I found the series to be ok, but not the caliber of the books. So much was omitted and rewritten in the story that it is hardly the series i remember. The true evil of the world is glossed over, the books make you understand what it is to fight to be free of opression and tyranny. Yes there is blood and shocking violence, but the books help you understand the real facts involved in taking control of your life and destiny. The series just doesnt do it for me. Watch it on line at hulu for free instead."
1,Incredibly disappointed,"I have no idea what possessed Terry Goodkind to allow someone to completely warp and destroy one of the greatest book series I have ever read. I can't tell you how many times I yelled BS at the TV screen while I watched this show, or how many times I couldn't stand watching it anymore and just shut it off. For the people who have never read the books and enjoyed the show, I feel very sorry for you. Because if this show had been done properly and in tune with the books it would have been a masterpiece to dwarf even the lord of the rings trilogy. So BRAVO terty goodkind for making something great then letting other people take a nice steaming dump all over it."
2,Legend of the seeker,"This is a typical example of movie makers thinking they know better then the author and the people that read their books.Books become popular and become best sellers because of the storyline.This series was advertised as based loosly on the books by Terry Goodkind that was an overstatement.The only similar thing to the book is the name of the characters, myself and my family were very dissapointed by the series as they turned it into a third rate Robin Hood show.I do not think I will bother with any further series.Film makers should relise if a book is good enough for a movie then stick to the book.That lesson should be learnt from the Harry Potter Series and why they are so popular and not some cheap TV series as they turned the Seeker Books into.However i will say the service from Amazon is excellent."
4,"Can't wait for the Blu-ray version, if they make it.","Many better reviews than I can write. This is a fun romp. If you liked Xena, Stargate, Firefly, and/or Farscape(the best of them all) then you will have a great time with this one.Just want to say it was great to see Bruce Spence again. He was the best part of Mad Max II as the roto-copter pilot. Great work here as the Wizard."
5,Enchanting Series,"The Legend of the Seeker first season is an escape from the everyday type of storylines. It is a little like when the Lord of Rings and Harry Potter came to the screen. The Countryside of course is New Zealand again, which is beautiful. The pairing of the main characters seem to work well together, kind of glad that the actors were less known because it is always good to see new fresh faces. Definitely have made it a point to know and find where this series is on the television schedules now and am waiting for the 2nd season DVD set."
5,Great Series: hoping for many more seasons to come!,I never watched this on TV. Saw it at Best Buy (shame on me as I am a huge Amazon customer!) but just couldn't resist I bought it.The characters are amazing and there is a total osmosis between them. The stories are simple but very efficient. I got hooked! D&D; movies should get a lesson of what has been done here....Thank you Mr. Director for a work very well executed.If you seek.... great entertainment... D&D; 'genre' the seeker is for you. I hope this show will go on for a along time and I am really looking forward to buying season 2 (on Amazon this time!)
3,They call him the Seeker,"Despite the fact that this show is the worst violator of deus ex machina I've ever seen, it's got some commendable points. Some obvious care went into the casting, as they did not fall back on many big-name American stars to ""sell"" it. The special effects and production value are pretty good considering it's for TV. I liked the Darken Rahl character but not what they did with him.But back to that deus ex machina comment from earlier. Is this a common function in the fantasy genre? Because there always seems to be some ""magic spell"" that gets the protagonists out of an impossible jam...and by the same note, if the protagonists are faced with a problem then the same ""magic spells"" never seem to work. Lazy writing, folks. Layyy-zeeee!"
5,Please bring back the Seeker and his Confesssor!!!,This must be the best series EVER!!! OMG - I was captivated from day 1! You just can not take your eyes off the action and adventure and the brilliant storyline. I swear someone MUST HAVE BEEN ON DRUGS to cancel this show. It was at its prime and they knocked it down......I am hopeful they will bring it back!
4,"What's wrong with ""YOU"" people! haha","I can't believe people still are surprised when shows and movies don't live up to the books they're based on.. ??? Have you ever heard somebody say, ""The book was pretty good but that movie was awesome!"" ? NO! If you're going to watch any movie or show based on any book than just think of them as alternate possibilities if a couple things were different or else you'll be let down every time.And if you're not sure about this one than watch it on hulu before you buy."
2,Nothing like the book.,"The writers of the screenplay used names and objects from the book, then adapted it to a weekly sitcom format. They stole sub-plots from older sitcoms and sci-fy/fantasy shows in a haphazard way. This was a so-so series. If someone had never read the book or was completely illiterate, they might enjoy it."
1,Sad turn of events,"Lets first start off saying that it is comendable to cast / crew / and writers for trying to make a tv series based upon such wonderfully detailed and image inspiring books. More commendable is that they even got the second season to come out. This however, is were they praise sadly ends. A comparison that a wise old man once told me pretty much sums this up - The reason you wear brown pants to battle is to hide the crap that is taken when faced with overwelming fear of the coming situation - ... This tv series though trying to show why the books were so good, actually tears the books apart and makes a gross characture of the beauty found in the pages. Now dont get me wrong as stated above there is some praise but, this is just too painful to watch.I would highly suggest skipping this. If the title does catch your interest though, pick up the book or kindle version of "" Wizard's First Rule"" by terry goodkind as this is the first book for which this series is based."
5,Well done!,The writing for this show is incredible. The episodes do things most TV don't dare. Each of the two first seasons had epic story arcs that closed at the end in a beautiful fashion. The only other place you would find such great writing is in Firefly.
4,"Surprisingly entertaining, decent performances","Engaging story lines, solid acting for what it is. If you liked Lord of the Rings, you'd probably like this."
1,Don't buy unless you have a PC!!!,I am a Mac-user and I bought the Legend of the Seeker so I could watch it on my computers and / or the tv/ ps3. You need a PC to download any and all of the Amazon Video on Demand. Amazon needs to extend their products to is Mac-people. I had to seek a refund. I did recurve the refund no problem.
1,Cheap seeker,"Maybe for a teen public..., but for my taste everything is cheap in this series; effects, actors,the characters, fighting scenes, brand new cloths on everybody..., cheap rip off of real fantasy!! Had enough with the first DVD of the first season. A waist of money."
1,Sword of Truth Does Not Equal Legend of the Seeker,"This Series does a poor job at recreating the Story, if you want a ""Richard"", Kahlan, and Zed in an alternate reality. Ok. It hardly follows the Story Line. I have only seen the first episode, but it decimated the storyline. Think ""The Count of Montecristo"" the Movie vs. ""The Count of Montecristo"" the Series. The Count of Montecristo Series was so much better than the movie that it was a disappointment to watch the Movie. That's how I feel with watching the Legend of the Seeker Series after having read the books. The Count of Montecristo Series did a fairly good job at following the book's storyline. The Legend of the Seeker does a very poor job at creating a Series that follows the books. Definitely not a ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Pride and Prejudice"" (The good one with Collin Firth.)."
5,Excellent DVD series.,"This is an excellent show. There are so many things about this show that one would love. It has action, mystery, love, terror, suspense, and adventure. Fist I didn't like the show on TV, but I kept watching it and now I'm hooked. I had to buy the series as soon as it came out on DVD. I now cant stop watching the show. Its somewhat different from the book, but thats what makes it an excellent show. Once you start watching it you cant stop."
5,Beautiful Music,"My children love this CD and what's even better, the rest of us do to! It's beautiful music for kids and adults. It's one of my favorite gifts for kids (and parents)."
3,Clamp not very vesitile...,"I purchased this stand shelf for use with a headphone amp attached under my mixer. Unfortunately, it only fits the smaller stand post of the mic stand as the clamp opening is too narrow for the thicker stand post. This makes it a bit top heavy but still functional on my three leg stand. Too heavy for the round base type stands tho', and it will tilt over."
2,"Tray very useful, but clamp unusable","I purchased this tray for headphone and other small item storage in my vocal isolation booth. I covered with carpet to reduce reflection, and mounted it on a pipe that runs vertically from the floor to the ceiling. The tray is very sturdy and a great size, but the clamp has proven unusable. I have not been able to tighten it or set it up in a way that does not make the tray droopy and unstable. I ended up rigging another clamp solution (with generous use of duct tape), so I am all set now. But only two stars because the tray did not work for me as delivered."
2,Doesn't fit on a mic stand,"the opening that is supposed to fit on the mic stand is too small to fit around any of my kmd, onstage, radio shack, or atlas mic stands on the lower tube and much too large for the upper tube making it kind of worthless. I may try to ream it out but the collar appears to be steel so it will be hard to work."
1,not worth it,it sucked. not level. will break in the long run. clamp could also be better. much happy with the vater cup holder clamp.
4,Better than I thought it would be!,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas because we had just finished watching the 3rd season on DVD and she remarked that she liked the music. I personally am not a huge fan of soundtrack CDs but I bought this for her and hoped she would enjoy it.Well, she's played it several times over our main sound system (she really likes it) and I've been amazed at how much I've enjoyed it, at least the parts I've heard. (Of course, we all know the opening theme is a classic, but that's only about a minute of the CD.)Hopefully I'll soon find an opportunity to listen to it from start to finish."
5,Often Neglected Subject,"This book touches on a very important issue that is often neglected in Christian circles, mentoring/spiritual fathering. After all Jesus gave us in the great commission these words: Matthew 28.19a Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations. Pastor Bayless Conley a man of integrity and character, one who I model my own life after, conveys keen insights from the Word of God and from his own personal experience from decades of being in ministry on this subject. How many times do we lead someone to Christ or see someone get saved only to result in him or her ""going it alone"" with nobody there for that individual to assist him or her in his or her walk. In looking at the Biblical pattern of spiritual fathering in depth, we as believers can glean invaluable methods in assisting our younger brothers and sisters in the Lord to ""grow"" down the right path."
3,Spiritual Fathering,"This is an incredible book regardless if you are a father, brother, mother, sister. This book offers practical insight with real life scenarios."
4,I am not sure that Rommel would agree,"This is not a John LeCarre type of novel, actually is an autobiography of Mr. Eppler at the time he was working for the Germans during the second world war. Nevertheless, it is very entertaining and achieves the purpose of showing the more less mundane world in which a spy moves, rather that the high trills and intense adventure in which these characters are portrayed by Hollywood. On the other hand, he clearly acknowledges that his services to Rommel were basically useless, so the title is really a merchandising tool, since if it have read ""My Life as a Spy"" by John W. Eppler, its chances of selling more that 10 books were severely limited."
4,Great product for the money!,"I needed this to drill through scrabble tiles sideways to use as jewelry components. It took me a while to get the speed right so I didn't burn through the wood, but works like a charm now. Somewhat awkward to get to the button you have to press to change drill bits.Yes, it's not a professional grade drill press, but for the price it's very useful and does a good job. Thank God someone posted a YouTube video on how to put the thing together, though. I'd have never figured it out from their crappy directions! Even the video could have benefited from slowing down and showing some close ups. But once up and running, it's a peach of a hobby tool. I would recommend it for light duty, not intensely precise work. Would give it five stars if the directions were anywhere close to adequate."
5,Dremel 220-01 Work Station,"This is a cool unit. It gives you precision use of the machine. For instance, I needed to drill some holes in a cribbage board that I was working on. The holes were perfect!"
4,Love this Dremel drill press,"Althought the Dremel 4000 by itself is a handy tool to have, you can't go wrong having the ""Dremel 220-01 Rotary Tool Work Station"" it has performed well for all the reason I use it for. I gave it 4 stars because if there is any room for improvement, It would be the nut to attach the Dremel 4000 with. Its made of plastic. I hope Dremel get enough of these suggestions to one day make it out of metal."
4,Works better than expected.,"Purchased for use with model train building. I have drilled holes and even set it up as a milling machine. Tolerances are better than expected, after combined with good translation table. Probably not as good as a Vanda Lay, but only 1/4 the price."
1,Makes a great space waster,I was really upset after finally being able to mess with this and my new Dremel. I was very careful to make sure the model numbers were compatible but to no avail- my tool does not fit. I am at loss and am sad as I had many projects based on using my Dremel with the press.
4,Dynamite mini drill press,"Only have used it a few times for small projects but incredibly useful tool. Now the only question, what is the longevity."
3,"The reviews here are accurate, its not precise",I read the reviews here and thought maybe they are being overly critical. They are not. This is a very cheap rig. Everything is connected together with excessive play and there is no way to modify it to be more precise easily. Overall its not a good setup. My mistake for not reading the reviews and avoiding this purchase.
1,220-01 Dremel Work Station -you get what you pay for,"I examined this product carefully at the store and found it to be poorly made. Its plastic construction results in a great deal of wobble and play. In my opinion it is not adequate for precision work. I researched alternatives and found a 3rd party precision drill press which is machined out of aluminum (The Drill Press Plus). Although it is more expensive, it is far more suitable for precision work."
1,Waste of money,"For the price, I don't spected a super precision tool, but actually the play can make the holes be 2 or 3 mm away from the desired point, making this tool unusable. May be replacing some parts with hand-made ones make this tool useful."
1,Junk.......,"My unit is Model 220 and from the pictures I don't expect the 220-1 to be any better.This tool is absolutely useless for any kind or precision drilling.Why, because the handle moves the Dremmel drill not only down but from side to side as well, due to the sloppy tolerances in the plastic castings. The downward motion is anything but smooth because of the cheap design substitute for a rack and pinion.Dremel should be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the marked."
2,horrible documentation bad set up,"Decent product once you set the thing up. However, the documentation is horrible and set up is less than intuitive. If you are short a piece, especially a small one, it's very very hard to tell. While the tool itself seems to work o.k. (nothing special), the shoddy support for the product - even in documentation - warrants a low rating and a warning to buyers. Be prepared to figure it out and just toss the POS manual since it does more harm than good."
2,Problem,The original packaging looks like it have been opened couple of times.. The cardboard is also torn. Looks used. Not very satisfied.
4,T H I S - T H I N G - I S - I N C R E D I B L E,"I've wanted one of these for a while, and now I've got one, and I almost can't believe how good it is. The only thing they could have added to it to improve it would be a notched positioning system so that you could tell when it was exactly lined up with the cross-hairs on the base of the unit. But even without that, it is fantastic. I can now drill/cut/grind/sand/smooth with a precision I never had before, using the Dremel Moto-tool I love so much. Be aware that it WILL allow you to drill holes etc. in the aluminum base if you don't have the tool positioned properly, and that it does NOT turn your Dremel tool into a heavy-duty drill press. The tool still has its limits, and you need to work within those, but this workstation greatly expands the repertoire of things you can do with your Dremel tool. While this is not (yet) a precision instrument, it is also not a child's toy, but then nothing involving the Dremel rotory tool is."
2,Flimsy construction,The first one I purchased couldn't be assembled. The second one fell apart after I used it to drill 5 holes. Very flimsy and so much movement that holes aren't straight. Ended up using Dremel router device for project and am very happy with that.
4,Very Good Product,Smooth operation and just the right amount of throw. Flexible to accomodate several different tools.
1,not a real tool,"I bought this hoping to use it as a portable drill press. I wasn't expecting much for $50. The build instructions were incomplete and inaccurate. Once built it was not very sturdy, it can not be used to properly drill even a single hole accurately. This isn't a tool, it's a toy."
3,Cheaply built but does the job,"This thing is very cheaply built. Once (painfully) assembled, it works fine. I had problems with wobble until I made sure to tighten down the several screws placed in awkward locations with dubious function. The contraption is far more mechanically complicated than I was hoping, and I expect it will need frequent re-tightening and adjustment to stay stable and centered.I recommend getting a used real drill press instead."
2,Worst. Assembly. Instructions. Ever.,"I bought this workstation to use as a drill press for my crafts business. I consider myself relatively handy and intelligent and the instructions could not have been more worthless. Bad graphics, poor wording. I was able to ""successfully"" assemble it only after lucking out at the local hardware superstore where they had a Dremel demo last weekend. The nice guy running the demo took one out of the box for me and helped me set it up. He agreed the instructions were, uh, lacking. Also recommended that I use plumbers' tape to fix the wobbliness of the tube assembly. Overall this piece is useful but it's also a big disappointment. C'mon Dremel, you can do way better.p.s. The packaging and such may not list it, but this *does* accommodate the Dremel 4000 Series."
2,Does NOT fit a Dremel 770,"I bought this tool for my husband for his birthday. He already had a Dremel model 770 and I made sure it was supported with this tool. Amazon says it does support the 770 model in the Technical Details. HOWEVER, we got the package home and my husband put it together only to find out it DOES NOT support the 770 model or anything in between 4000 and 8200 for that matter. He ended up buying a new dremel cause he really liked the concept of it, but I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with the false advertising by Amazon!"
5,happy,Once again I amvery happy with my purchase. The Dremel Tool is great nd my husband s beyond happy with it.
4,Cheap drill press,"I work on model trains and this stand allows me to have a drill press that is the right size for my work. It needs a holding vise, but it does what its supposed to do otherwise."
4,Dremel Rotary Tool Work Station,"The Dremel Rotary Tool Workstation performs quite well. There is a learning process that I had to go through to become proficiant with the tool though. The only complaint I have about the tool is there is a little ""slop"". When trying to do some precision work you have to take it very easy and not put too much pressure on the machine or it will move. The Dremel itself moves just the slightest amount. But, in precision work that little movement can make or break a project.Other than that, it is a fine tool that will give me many years of enjoyment."
3,"Not bad, very handy","I liked it, but the directions could use a little improvement. Other than that, it seems to be good. I would recommend it."
3,Dremel Work Station,The Dremel work station is ok if you aren't looking for precision. The mounts are made of cheap plastic and tend to flex when any amount of force is applied when working on your project. I was trying to use it as a drill press to drill precision holes but the mount flexes and not all of the holes came out straight.I use the work station for sanding and holding the Dremel tool while using the flex shaft and it works great for those tasks.
1,The Dremel Work Station is a disappointing product!,"For my hobby, working with stone for lapidary and jewelery, this product is a disappointment. There is a lack of precision in the slide mechanism. This results in a lateral (side to side) movement of about 2mm at the cutting tool when modest pressure is applied. This means that it is impossible to drill a precisely positioned small hole as for a jump ring or pendant chain.I spoke with Dremel's customer support by phone. At first the support person didn't understand the problem. When I explained that I needed to adjust the slide mechanism to make it tighter and reduce the side to side play, she seemed flummuxed and could offer no help. She suggested I contact a retail dealer. I don't expect Amazon, my dealer, is prepared to provide the kind of product help I need.Before buying the product I would like to have seen the specification of precision in relevant documentation in print or on-line.Victor Wyman"
2,Not up to Dremel standards,"If you intend to do quality work skip this accessory. It has way too much slop in every axis. It won't hold verticle, I eventually put a drywall screw through it. You can't set a working depth and hold it. The actual Dremel tool installs with excessive tolerance.The basic idea is a good one, it has the possibility to add a number of items to the veratility of the basic Dremel tool unfortunalately it doesn't live up to the Dremel name."
1,Sloppy,Lots of play. Should have sent it back. Use it as a holder for my flex shaft dremel ..... don't buy
5,A great accessory for the Dremel,"I originally purchased this workstation to use with very small jeweler drill bits for drilling PCB board. Using the Dremel and these bits by hand usually results in broken bits because they are so fragile. In ""drill press"" mode, this workstation did the job and did it perfectly.For the overall quality of the workstation, i would give it an 7/10. It can be a bit flimsy and the rotation of the head is nowhere near precise, but for hobbyist work and my intent of only using it as a small press, it worked perfectly and is a great addition to my Dremel 4000."
2,Good Luck Drilling Straight Holes,"Or more accurately, good luck drilling holes perpendicular to the workpiece. The tool is held way off plumb from the base plate, a few degrees front to back and almost as much side to side. There is no adjustment for front to back. It's a shame, the actual construction and operation of the tool is pretty good but if it can't drill straight it does not meet the primary purpose. Maybe Dremel will correct these issues one day and make this worth buying."
3,Dremel press,"Lots of versatility... but its very ""light duty"". Not suitable for any moderate level of machine precision with anything much harder than balsa wood. Don't get me wrong, it does work well but the Dremel mount flexes significantly under any lateral pressure."
4,Dremel work station,Very flexable item. Can be used as a drill press or a stable platform to do horizontal work.The price is very good for the quality of the device. It is not a toy or just for small job applications.I would purchase it again and I recommend it to others.
1,Not sure what this is actually useful for,"I have been and continue to be a fan of Dremel products, but this adapted is totally useless as both drill press and mill. The main problem is lack of support for the tool. Even with the locks fully engaged, the Dremel was shaky. I was unable to get a hole drilled in a piece of aluminum without the assembly shaking. Save yourself a bunch of hassle and get a real drill press."
3,"Can't drill up to 1/4""","This is a terrific tool unless you want to make things that require drilling holes from 1/8"" to 1/4"" or larger. Dremel rotary tools won't do that and I couldn't find a work-around. I want to make dishracks and I work a little with 1/16"" aluminum. This workstation would have been perfect. I had to return it and buy a benchtop drill press - far bigger equipment than I would have preferred."
4,Awesome Product. Well designed.,A well designed product. I would make this purchase again. I don't know why I waited as long as I did to purchase this. This was delivered in only 3 days using super saver shipping.
1,Should have read more of those negative reviews!,"I couldn't believe something by Dremel could be as bad as some reviewers have experienced--so I ordered the stand anyway. BIG mistake.The assembly instructions are indeed horrible. Wish I had seen the instructions posted here before I started, would have saved much aggravation.The device itself is also horrible. My unit would NOT adjust to a true vertical. The plastic cowling was distorted. And the 2mm horizontal play noted by some was clearly present, making the stand useless for drilling--unless you are aiming for the side of a barn. Or you punch the center deep and pray the bit doesn't wander.Do yourself a favor: pass on this one and get a real mini drill press."
3,Not So Hot - A bit tinker toyish,Not for heavy use. Secure mounting an absolute. For small projects it is ok. Probably would do as well as by freehand.
3,What goes were...,"It was a lot to put together, directions were not all that helpful. Could have been a bit more specific with where things should have went together."
4,The Dremel 220-01 Rotary Tool Work Station is very good.,The assembly of this tool took no more than 30 minutes which included reading the included manual.The use if this tool is mostly intuitive and easy to setup and use. I have used the work station 2 or 3 times since I received it last month Jan 2010. It works great. I would highly recommend this product.
2,Misleading and Poor Quality,This product says that it will fit a Dremel 395. My problem is that the Dremel I am in possession of is a model 395 circa 1984. The Dremel I have has a different body style than the current 395's and will not fit the drill press. I can understand this mistake but it would have saved me time and money spent to know this detail. As for the press itself it is definitely of budget construction. The assembly is pretty simple but that is after you interpret the poorly written and skimpy instructions. All-in-all you get something that should be priced around $40.00 and in today's world that is not saying much. The old Dremel in my possession is still going strong after 26 years; I don't think this drill press will have much worth after the same amount of time except as scrap metal and plastic.
4,looks nice,"again , if you have a dremel tool you must have this thing (i dont know how to use it yet, haha, but someday i will )"
1,NOT AS SHOWED IN PICTURE,"this purchase is not as shown in the website picture. The DRILL DRIVE is not included. the package look like open item. Cheap plastic, for metal work this is not good, small hobby its ok. PICTURE IS 80% misleading.Dremel 220-01 Rotary Tool Work Station"
2,Dremel drill press,It is made in China.....Does anybody else get tired of everything we purchase now days coming from China? Enough!!!!!!!!!
5,Excellent product,"I love this product, It is wonderful. This product has met all my expectations, I recommend it those who want to buy."
4,drill press,Once i had it figured out as the instructions weren't as clear as they ccould be it seemed to work okay. I was using balsa wood and it could use some type of clamping or once through it picks up the object.
4,"Great for the price, but...","For what this cost it is a good value, but it definitely is not a precision drill press. It is great if you already have a Dremel rotary tool and only occasionally need to use an impromptu drill/routing stand, but if your needs are more precise or more frequent, then spend the extra $$$ and get a real press. Also, if you are left-handed the rightside lever is rather inconvenient."
2,Info not correct.,"I ordered this product because it said it worked with the dremel 7700. Got it in the mail today took it out of the box and put it togther. Once i finished putting it together i noticed the mount didnt look like it would fit my dremel. After that i took another look at hte box and saw the following.Fits Dremel Models 275, 285, 395, 800: 100, 200, 300 and 400xpr series; 4000 amd 8200.This is not the advertised product and im not happy. Its a lovely station but now i have to return it or find another dremel to use with it."
2,Big disappointment,"I heard a lot about great quality of Dremel tools, so when I was looking for a drill stand for precision work, I did not think much and bough 220-01. This turned out to be a big mistake. The stand is flimsy, has a lot of play. Even after a light press on the handle the drill moves a few millimeters to a side. Tightening screws helps a bit, at a cost of higher resistance. I ended up using a cheap chinese stand.After I discovered Proxxon, Dremel tools ended up collecting dust on a shelf. They are useful for doing work around the house, but pretty much useless when accuracy is required."
4,Women are from Palnu and guys are from Sand Hills Creek,"For the first 3/4 of the book, Cerebus tries to stick to his plan from the last book of becoming everybody's friend. The problem is, he's trying this in a bar, and he's not always pleasant when he's drunk. Eventually, all his friends desert him, with the excuse that they're all running away from Bear's girlfriend, which doesn't make sense as Bear and his girlfriend also leave.Cerebus then becomes the bartender of the empty bar. Not long after, Joanne arrives. They have a brief affair. I'll leave the cause of their break up as a surprise. Why does everyone hate Joanne, anyway?With this continuing story, to really get it, you need to read every volume. Except for Melmoth."
5,"Excellent Pop Melodic Tour of America, Thanks to the Hoff","I greatly enjoyed Mr. Hasselhoff's personal selections -- and so will you. Although he is a good singer, his voice was slightly strained on the very low opening notes of ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling."" The country-western dialect he used in several songs sounded natural. My favorite song (outside of ""New York, New York"") is first on the album -- City of New Orleans -- because I am a daily commuter on the Long Island Railroad!The song lyrics in the booklet were helpful but out of sequence with the record. The accompanying photos were most attractive for obvious reasons; but one with a representation of an American Flag on a horse's head seemed inappropriate.On the other hand, I enjoyed the inclusion of ""America"" from West Side Story as well as the ""Knight Rider"" theme. The Christmas music was a delightful bonus. Glad to have this edition in my collection."
5,A Classic Album You Need To Own,"David has fallen into his own dark hole of self-emulation and alcoholic escape as of late, but this album was his last great gasp of greatness before he would sink into a world of self-depression and alcoholic abuse. The listener should be thrilled with the wide range of musical selections Hasselhoff thoughtfully grooms to his own style to bring to his beloved German audience of off-beat hand-clappers, many of whom did not hear the first go round of selections in their prime, to a pulsating orgasmic conclusion of musical brilliance. Highlights include a rousing and fitting finale with the Knight Rider theme song, but in general this is simply a quality cover album in which David proves his critics wrong with a tender and versatile voice that is always respectful and considerate of the original interpretation. The one Hasselhoff album to start with."
5,Too bad there wasn't a duet with KIT...,"Surprising is an understatement. While none of these songs are originals, Hasselhoff never-the-less brings each one of these ""classics"" to life in his own way. Unlike many celebrities who jump on the create-an-album bandwagon, the Hoff actually has some natural skill. I bought this album on a whim after seeing the Hoff on German TV doing an impressive showing of Rhinestone Cowboy. They love him over there, and this album was worth the price I paid... even if for nothing else but to say that the Hoff is part of my music collection."
4,Rare UK garage rock,"David Bowie once said that the differance between British & American Psych is that British kids went to art school! Those fimilar with the ""60s punk"" comps of US bands should ckeck out this CD of their UK contemparies. It's cleaner, tighter & more creative than US garage rock (but, to be honest, less intence). Best moments: ""resurection city"" by Earth (who, by releasing their 45, forced another band with the same name to change to Black Sabbath!) and the early metal of ""kamakhazie moth"" by Jeruslem."
3,OBSCURE BRITISH PSYCHEDELIA,"Another volume brought out by obscurity specialists Bam caruso,starting off where volumes 1+2 left off.This time focusing on psychedelia.Some of the stuff featured on here is musically very good like the actress song job with prospects which catches your ear.This one comes with a couple of pictures but no info like volumes 1+2 plus this time 2 mystery tracks I like buying this series because I like the surprise of what the songs are like."
5,Key to GOOD Math students,"Keys to Fractions (as well as the other books, Key to Decimals, Key to Algebra, Key to Percents) are WONDERFUL for two types of learners.For the child who hates math: These books make learning math do-able. The math student gets the concept in small bits and IS successful. Concepts are mastered, the child feels good about learning math and you will appreciate the simple, easy-to-use format.For the child who loves math and wants more at an early age: These books can be used successfully to teach higher concepts to a younger child. We started using the series in the third grade with our two oldest boys. They felt EMPOWERED. The books are great.I first saw a book to this series when cleaning out a dusty shelf in the corner of my 1st classroom the day before my first day of teaching. That was almost 20 years ago. I've been a fan ever since."
4,LinguaFun! Spanish,We have enjoyed using this product and the only complaint we have is the CD. The first 4 tracks of the CD do not play. We contacted Amazon.com and they replaced the product which included a new CD. This second CD was also defective. The first 4 tracks would not play. We believe that the first 4 tracks of all CDs are defective.
5,No one writes like this anymore.,"I picked this book up in a used book store and discovered a masterpiece. It chronicles mental illness and three people who's lives are profoundly changed from that journey. It has three distinct sections; each from one of the character's point of view. It moved me and I could see myself in each character. I cried many tears and felt myself validated as I followed their paths. This book is has become a cherished possession. I have found other book Elizabeth Yates has written for young people that are appropriate for all ages. Especially ""Mountain Born""."
5,Timeless Simplicity,"On Living Simply is a wonderful way to introduce yourself to the simple eloquence of St. John Chrysostom. His words illustrate his profound insight into life that is as applicable now as when it was origionally recorded in Late Antiquity. If you are interested in Patristic Christian thought or just in Ancient Wisdom, I highly recommend this book to you."
5,Excellent Small Grinder,"I sold tools for a living in my recent past. The Makita grinders were the ones that got returned for repair the least. There are a few good grinders out there, they all cost more than the ""one job junk"" that some people are happy to have. I learned from my customers that Makita, with it's venting system to keep grit out of the motor, will outlast most any of them. The masonry contractors especially insisted on Makita; and these guys would wear out three or four a year, per man !I like Bosch and Milwaukee too, but every one of these companies has a tool where they really got it right. I aim to wear out my Makita grinder doing the stuff I enjoy !It works great, and that's what I demand.Hank"
1,Not for heavy use,I purchased this unit 4 months ago. I used it heavily until it burned out yesterday. This is a CONSUMER unit. Do NOT buy if you are using it heavily.Has NO overload protection. I suggest you NOT buy tools via Amazon. There is NO WAY to handle warranty claims without going direct to the manufacturer. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. I will purchase all my tools locally from now on.
5,Makita Angle Grinder,"Makita 9557PB 4-1/2-Inch Angle Grinder w/Paddle Switch, (AC/DC)This one is great!!! Amazon shipped fast and I had her on the job. This is one smooth and quiet machine with plenty of power to spare."
1,the product is lost in my country,"This product never came to my hands, in my country apparently things get lost in customs, was lost to get to my country"
4,As expected,Good grinder. We use it for commercial applications and it's heavy duty and very durable. Would buy again.
4,great fit,"Shoes allow you to adjust for high instep, and wide feet. You can wear them all day with no problem. My only complaint was the sole wears out to quickly. Wish the material there was more durable."
2,Not very interesting,"I don't mean to be unkind, but I did not find this movie very interesting or informative at all. I am just thankful that I only paid $1.99 to rent it rather than $20.00 to buy it. I didn't even bother to finish watching it because I felt I was wasting my time. Perhaps you will enjoy it; I did not."
4,Decent,"Pretty well balanced, and very slim to grip one-handed. Plenty of power for almost everything I can imagine anyone using a 4.5"" grinder for. The switch is also very sensitive, if you need to turn it off in a hurry it's not hard, feels safer than some.Unfortunately, this is made in China, and given the luck I've been having with their products of late, I probably wouldn't have had the GF pick this up for me had I known. C'mon Japan, you can do better.If one-handed operation isn't a priority, may I recommend the superbly balanced and even more powerful Metabo which I have also had the pleasure to use? It's made in Germany!"
2,voltage 110v,According to the site indicated the voltage of the machine is 240v and as indicated by the machine I have in my possession is 110v Request a solution as soon as possible as I travel to Spain on Saturday
2,Decent book,"This book is basically a regurgitation of CFW Walther's 39 thesis work in more contemporary language. If you have read Walther, dont get this book."
3,decent for price,"The chair that it came with fell apart within two days of assembly even though the directions were followed to a T. Nevertheless, I got what I expected for the price I paid and the desk is still in working order. That's all that matters to me. With the lamp, it wasn't a bad deal. Just make sure you have another seating arrangement."
1,No labeled Parts...Still Can't Figure It out,The parts came unlabeled...no letters on any of the parts...the instructions and diagram are too small to read. I have not been able to figure out the assembly yet. Ridiculous. I would not have bought it if I knew it was a series of unlabeled metal poles and no instructions.
1,Series of serious errors,"I was upset when i found my package sitting on the porch of my aprtment, in full view so anyone could walk off with my order. In truth I cant really review the product because I wasnt able to put it together because there was no instruction manual included wiith my order. Well at least if someone stole it they would be unable to get any enjoyment out of it, just as I am."
4,EXPERIMENTAL INDUSTRIAL BLACK METAL,"True black metal fans won't like this album. It combines the industrial sound with death metal vocals and riffs in a chaotic fashion. The title track is more metal than industrial, and it is followed By ""There is no God S.T.A."" which is mostly industrial...heck you could even dance to it without breaking furniture. Selections such as ""Total Black"" had me scratching my head as did ""Theta Paranoia"" whose beats imitate slow rhythmic breathing and about put me to sleep. I like a band that is willing to experiment and take chances...but at the same time they need to be entertaining, something Aborym misses on the head scratchers."
5,"Good, inexpensive cologne","I have gotten many compliments on this fragrance. I've tried many expensive perfumes/colognes, but I like this best, and I've gotten more compliments on it and questions about what perfume I was wearing than any other fragrance. It has become difficult to find in stores and now have to order it online."
5,The type of cable I like,"bought this quite a while, thought sharing some of my experience, hopefully help your decisions a bit.I had to move my TV from family to living room, but the living room donot have cable outlet, and I donot want to fish the cable through the wall, as well. My house's construct is not a easy job.Initially I had the older cable hanging around the floor to bring the signal to living room, apparently this is not a long term solution. Found this one, and brought it in, it's so thin and soft, amazingly the cable's color matches to my wall color, so I just ran it along the edge of wall with double side tapes, it's hide pretty well, without paying much attention, you would not notice it there at all.I just wish all the cable/satellite companies could switch these cables for their customers, instead of those old, hard thick cables ;)"
2,"A little scholarship, please","So, when did Maya Angelou received the Nobel Prize for literature? pg.129"
3,Toxic CRUSADERS!,"See this; in 1991, and Mukirami wolf, hot on the heels of the TMN turtle sucess, ask troma if they will allow them to clean up and transform their hot toxic avenger property and make it into a show. Well, here it is, and its good. After troma reluctantly agree,d they entered into an agreement with New Line cinema to make a big budget (10 million) live action movie, which troma would make but would still be a kids movie.The plan was shelved however, when new line began to lose money (This was before 'The Mask') and so, Lloyd kaufman, circa 1996, decided as Troma was heating up again due to tromeo and juliet, that he should animate the movie instead. But unfort. he just re-editd the show into this. Great for nostalgia, but there is no flowig plot, it's like the 1st 20 mins of a movie."
5,Marvelous Soneo!!!!,"This album is a great album all around. It includes one of Marvin's most famous songs ""El Pasajero"" which shows Marvin's personality as just a normal Puerto Rican, not a star. His funny lyrics also tells real life stories. ""El Hombre Increible"" alone makes this album a must have. It is a great display of his soneo skills. Other tracks like ""Chinas por Botellas"" ""Aqui estoy ya yo llegue"" round out an excellent album. Another plus is that Universal remastered it pretty well so, GRAB IT if you can."
3,Pretty good cable..,"I've recently tried out the Monster Video 2 RCA connectors in my home theater system. They seem to carry more than enough bandwidth for VCRs, and pretty good quality on DVD. I noticed a slight bit of noise when using Monster Video 2, but so fine that its not incredibly noticeable on a 25 inch tv. Other than that, it seems to work fine. Good cable."
2,"Great Value, but difficult install","I was pleased with the product in terms of what it offered and the price, but when it came time to install, that was a different story. XP did not recognize it as a 2.0 device, it wanted to use the generic 1.0 drivers, thus 1.0 speed. I had to manually update the driver and pick from a list with the hit-and-miss method - an automatic search would not find it. I have finally got it to recognize the device correctly, but have not tested to see if it meets 2.0 bandwidth yet.I would go for a major brand next time."
1,Skip this product.,Bought this to add USB2.0 slots to a ThinkPad. Was never able to get it to work. I wound up buying a Belkin which worked immediately. Don't but this item.
5,helps bypass broken usb ports and sync an Iphone,"I needed this device after the usb ports on my ibm t42 stopped working high powered devices (lost power), so I used this card since the card bus takes power directly form the battery and does not rely on the motherboard. I used it to sync my iphone (did not work on the original usb) and I keep the cable plugged in anyway (doesn't make a lot a sense, possibly just voodoo- since the cable plugs in the original usb's that don't have power anyway) and it WORKS GREAT, FIVE STAR. seamless hook up, plug and play no bull. speedwise: it took five minutes to update a new version of iphone op sys (same time it takes in apple store), so usb-2!"
2,Not enough power for external HDD drives,"Would not power my 160GB WD external drive, even when this card is powered via the PS2 port on my 3yr old Dell notebook. Is it the card? is it the notebook? I don't know, but I know this item is sitting around un-used, along with my 160GB hard drive. I'd suggest a) going with a better solution, whatever that may be and 2) return the device asap if it does work!"
4,It works.,"This worked perfectly on my Inspiron 4100. However, it's not that sturdy. And, because of how far it sticks out of the side of the laptop, it's easy to put pressure on it and break it, especially if you like to use your laptop on your lap instead of on a table or desk."
3,"Works, but not powered","The card was recognized and installed on a Compaq NC6000 with XP Pro properly.The included power cable does not connect to the PS/2 port, but to another USB port. I am going to try using a USB AC charger to power the card. Without external power, ports do not work with iPod Shuffle 2nd Gen. A Lexmark X1175 printer device will spontaneously appear and disappear, and Microsoft Mouse would hang intermittently."
5,Crespin and Ansermet - a wonderful evening,"Although I'm not a huge fan of Ansermet and his Suisse Romande orchestra, I thoroughly enjoy this disc. I purchased this older version, as I had read that the ""remastered"" version had been compressed, etc. The sound on this CD is full and pleasing. It is very good for a CD. I find the Berlioz and Ravel pieces more interesting than the Debussy, etc."
4,perfect for me,"I am a beginning golfer, and I did not want to spend a lot of money on my first set of clubs. These are perfect for me. They look nice and the weight of them is good. I would definitely recommend these golf clubs to anyone who is looking for a nice, reasonably priced set of clubs."
4,"Good clubs, wrong color","These clubs are a great beginner set for my wife to get into the game. The stand bag is great and is hard to find for these entry level sets. My only complaint is the color. In the picture, this bag looks distinctly blue. However, upon receiving it, it is some sort of lavender color. My wife wanted this set specifically because of the color (she doesn't want a ""girly"" color) and was disappointed by the color. However, we decided to keep the set despite the color because it is the best option out there."
5,Incredible Photography and Content!,"This book is a must for those who truly enjoy a great table! The photos are magnificent and is beautifully written. I found that I learned a LOT by simply looking at the photos of china, crystal and glassware. From this book alone, I chose my sterling silver flatware and china patterns and have never regretted it! The book also gives ideas on simple room decorations as well - even though this is not a primary focus of the book itself. I really can't say enough good about this book......Update:Ten years later (November 2009) I am still in love with this book! I have given copies to many people over the years and everyone loves it as well. If Amazon allowed 10 stars, this would still qualify for 99!"
2,Buyer beware,I bought this grinder because I have a Makita drill that has worked trouble free for over 10 years. This grinder had plenty of power but was on the job for less than two hours when the pinion gear went out. It was covered under warranty but it took over two months to get it fixed! The Makita service center said that this Makita was made very cheep and that just because it is a Makita's does not mean you have a top quality tool. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,memories of childhood days in church,Ray Price has certainly never sounded better then he does in this album of the older hymns of days gone by This one belongs in everyone's collection
3,Could be SO much better,"Matt O'Ree is a great blues guitar player,but sadly his vocalslack feel and immediately remind me of Mike Onesko. I highly recommend Matt follows in the footsteps of Chris Aaron and Kenny Wayne Shepherd to name but two, and employ a real frontman vocallist."
5,Power Punk Pop Personified,"Name one other band that could put out their best album after20 years.With the exception of the almighty Dictators new album,no one!Every FBX album,has been a gem,but this one tops 'em all.Great guitar work,the always cool vocals of Kim & Lulu,killer-bee drumming by Mike Musburger,and most of all,theace songwriting of Kurt Bloch.I'm 48,I've heard thousands of albums over the years,andI'd put ""The Day That Didn't Exist"" in my Top 10 of all time.Let's hope they've got another decade or two left in 'em,theyhave been & continue to be one of the best bands around."
5,A Great Machine!,"I have owned this brute of a machine for the last 8 years! I have only had to replace my belt once and serviced my machine 3 times. I live in the great white north and would not be able to move if I didn't have this kind of a blower. It will chop ice blocks, it will throw wet snow and it always starts on the first pull. Only draw back is that on slippery days it's a brute to move around. I can clear my drive way long before my neighbours! Gotta love it!"
1,Didn't work,"I really feel like this didn't work for me. I will, however, give it a few more tries since I paid $22 for it."
1,A Waste of Money,"This spray had absolutely no effect on me. Sleepytime tea works better and tastes better, too. Having said that, I discovered I have acute sleep apnea and my body is fairly resistant to non-prescription remedies. So, maybe if you just need a little help it might work. But, I doubt it, unless you are super-sensitive to such concoctions."
5,The Sempron is a budget powerhouse!,"You cannot go wrong choosing a retail boxed AMD CPU. I recently installed the 3000+ on an MSI K9VGM-V motherboard along with 2 GB of Kingston KVR667D2N5 RAM. I cannot verify performance figures of the other Athlon offerings, but this little Sempron packs fantastic bang for the buck. If you are building on a budget, the Sempron line is the way to go. Always purchase the retail box since the included active heat sink is pretty much all you will need for stock performance and cooling. Installation was a snap.Do note there is something about the Sempron and using 667 MHz versus 800 MHz RAM in the fine print of the literature someplace. Those specs may have changed, but I have had absolutely no problems with the 3000+ CPU and 667 RAM combo.Also, the SDA3000CNBOX runs at 1.6 GHz, not the 1.8 GHz listed on the top of this page as of the time of this writing of the review. It must be a typo, but something you need to be aware of before purchasing."
2,A very disappointing purchase,"I thought this book was a very disappointing purchase. All it is, is a very vague encyclopaedia. They didnt go into much detail about anything and the stuff they did go into detail on wasn't that important. The worst part was how they stress in the product detail the new feats and prestige classes. Which are about 2 or 3 good ones at best. This book is a waist of money and time."
3,Not all that bad. Still rocks.,"Great White's _Let It Rock_ finds them true to their roots, at least. Even though they seem to have lost some of their earlier optimism and determination in their songwriting, the guitars are there and the beats are consistent. They have not bought into the '90's sound, though there are some rawer tones on the record. It's a welcome change from their acoustic sets. Oh, yeah. They still really sound like Led Zep...but did I have to say that?"
2,"Not their best work, but still Great White","Not their best work, but still Great White. After a long string of super albums such as ""Once Bitten,"" ""Twice Shy,"" ""Hooked,"" ""Psycho City,"" etc. this one was disappointing. With the exception of ""Hand on the trigger,"" many of the songs are very forgettable. I love Great White and have seen them live three times. Can't wait until your next album guys. Please keep rockin'!!!!"
4,"Let it Rock, Rocks!!","If you love good blues based rock'n'roll, this is a disc for you. There is a good reason Great White has endured. They continue to put out excellent music! ""Let it Rock"" is great collection of rockers with a taste of the mellow, for balance. This disc slipped under the radar, but is certainly some of GW's best work. If you liked their Once Bitten album, you will dig this one for sure. Long live Great White!!"
4,A great but underappreciated album of solid rock music.,"This was a fine album of music that was better than The Rolling Stones ""Voodoo Lounge"" LP. Unfortunately, most American rock fans did not find out about it. Only the sad state of American radio can be blamed for this album's lack of exposure to the millions of rock music listeners across America. This is why I hate bands like Wheezer and The Presidents of the United States of America, who received loads of air-play during the 90's while the music of Great White was over-looked. Those cheesy pop rock knockoffs can't measure up to Great White. Please do yourself a favor and purchase this album. It Rocks!"
4,HEY! THIS IS GREAT WHITE,"GREAT WHITE HAS NEVER BEEN GIVEN THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE.THE BAND ROCKS AS A WHOLE,NO MATTER WHAT STYLE OF MUSIC THEY PLAY.IM GLAD THEY HAVE STUCK TO THIER ROOTS,UNLIKE SO MANY OTHERS.THEY WILL BE AROUND A LONG TIME,& I'LL STILL BE LISTENING!"
3,refrig water filter,Have used these filters on other Kitchenaid and Whirlpool refirgerators. The newly installed one leaves an aftertaste. Will swap it for another.
5,excellent service!!!,I ordered this filter and it was the wrong size. The company was excellent about taking it back and promptly refunding my money!!
2,It's been more trouble than it was worth...,"I purchased this snow thrower in 2005. As far as I am concerned, it is a lemon (true to its color). First problem was with the chute, which froze up; once we got it operational, it constantly turns with the vibration of the machine.Next, the starter went, then the headlight; now the carb needs to be replaced and per our local repair shop, Tecumseh has backordered the part until May or June of 2010.At this point, I would pay someone to take the darn thing, and I will not be purchasing any Yardman or MTD products in the future. My suggestion - consult Consumer Reports before you purchase.Because of the problems we had with this machine, we bought a backup from Sears - which works flawlessly."
5,John Waite - Temple Bar,"What happens when an 80's Pop Star starts to lose his shine? He could drink himself to death and end up on TMZ. Unless he's John Waite. In that case, he sheds the 80's glitz and digs deep in his soul to produce meaningful works of music art such as ""Temple Bar""."
2,John Waite Temple Bar,"I can't tell you how happy I was to finally find Temple Bar!!! I haven't stopped listening to this CD! It's a shame that the record company at the time didn't promote it properly. This CD is simply AWESOME! There isn't a bad song on it, this is definately John Waite at his best."
4,NIce addition...,"Without going into the merits of each story, I can say that the book is a worthwhile buy for those interested in the ol' HPL genre.There were some storied that I felt failed (aren't there always?), but the majority of the stories were great and really kept my attention and interest.Even in a sunny location. So for those stories, I have to say this belongs on a ""cultist's"" shelf."
2,Mediocre at best,"If you love XML and SQLCLR, this book is for you. For me, I do most of my work using .NET and T-SQL. This book left me wanting when learning about those topics. I love XML like the next person but having so much dedicated space to it is overkill for most people. Save your money if you're a mainstream SQL Server developer and buy a different book."
1,Needs Color And More Information,With the pages in black and white it's very difficult to determine what tooth you actually have. There are no pictures of what the sharks look like or where the teeth are typically found. I was very unhappy with this book.
3,Surprised it wasn't comprehensive,"If you're going to write about sharks teeth, why not include them all? This seemed to be too short, too little information, and all of the stingrays (in the shark family) were left out. We find sharks teeth on the coast of Virginia and only a few of them were in this book."
4,An ok overall summary of shark tooth varieties,"I have collected fossil shark teeth for 30 years and have purchased many different books. This is a nice basic summary of the various types of teeth that you are likely to encounter. For any extensive identification or details I usually look at palentology data at universities. So I would recommend this as a base, knowing that for details you will always have to dig out more details from professional references."
5,Jaws uncovered,"Being an amateur fossil collector I grabbed Joe Cocke's book to learn more about fossil shark teeth. I found the guide well organized and easy to use. You'll find pictures, the different accepted names used (scientific and common), a detailed description along with references to similar teeth and of course the age. Discovering what kind of tooth you actually found is a lot of fun. This is definitively a great guide."
3,Hard to read in general,"I used this book to supplement a course in queuing theory and found it to be not as helpful. The derivations of the various queuing models are difficult to follow. Queuing theory is not that hard once you get it, but this book doesn't seem to be ideal for beginners. I would recommend FUNDAMENTALS OF QUEUEING THEORY, instead. For those who already know some queuing theory, I guess this book would be okay. Personally, I gave it three stars, but I won't argue with people that rate it higher."
2,The back story to Eternity's End - but not nearly as good,Star-Rigger Gev Carlyle found himself alone on a spaceship where all the other riggers had been killed by a space anomaly and unable to get the ship home by himself till he stumbled across someone else also stranded.After reading _Eternity's End_ by this same author I found this book a disappointment. Although it must be said that this book dovetails into that one with certain sequences. I nevertheless found it hard to warm to Gev who seemed slightly crazed throughout this entire book with his obsessive attempt to re-create a past already lost to him. Its easy to see from this book how much this author has improved over the years from this rather simple SF story to his much more rich _Eternity's End_ offering.
2,Interstellar travels using mind controlled ships.,"Star Rigger's Way is a story of a pilot and the ship he guides through intersteller space by a mind enhanced guidance system. Beyond the space and science references, the story reads much like any other man & ship story, be it in space or ocean.A little on the pyscodelic side, Star Rigger's way is an easy read and would make a good summer beach book."
2,"Fits well, looks good but leaks!","I bought this product to fit over my schwinn jogging stroller and whilst it fits well and appears good quality water leaks through the bottom of the window onto the child tray. I have made several attempts to adjust it but without success, I end up with a pool of water in the childtray!"
5,This is great!,I bought this as a gift for my sister in law- she loves it and said it fits both her strollers with no problem. It keeps her son warm even in the bitter cold- and she lives where it goes down to -30. It looks great.
2,Great item if it does not arrive defective,"The item looked great on arrival. I tried it on my Maclaren Mc3 stroller and imagined how well it will work. Only imagined, because when it arrived it was missing most ties and velcros and could not be securely attached to the stroller. Now I have to go through the pain of exchanging it -- hoping the second shipment will contain proper quality product....Or may be I should return it and get something else?"
3,stroller cover,it arrived in a reasonable time. there is not much room for the child to see out of. More clear plastic would be better. The clear plastic is also very wrinkly and has a lot of blue dye on it from the material whixh does not come off with washing. I even used alcohol and other cleaners and it stayed the same. It does fit well and comes down on the sides and back to really protect the child. I haven't tried it with my year old but I'm thinking he's not going to be to happy with trying to look out of a small wrinkled spotted cover.
5,Fantastic!,"Miss MacDonald is superb as always,but one cannot help but hear as she sings,a trace of genuine sadness.Her voice has never been equaled,an angel on earth.The setting as well as her costume(s) are absolutly stunning,only adding,if possible to her natural beauty.Talent,grace & charm such as this is never forgotten.A must see classic for anyone who loves beauty,music,human life drama----& Jeanette.Only I feel her leading co-star(Gene Raymond) was not quite equel to her incredible talent.Otherwise--it's defenitly a five star.If you love a true-to-life-warm-your-heart-make-you-cry movie......see this."
1,Disappointed is an understatement,"After owning this Philips LCD TV for just over 12 months it is virtually useless. Problems with it started after about 8 months of use, when the sound would shut off altogether or emit an ear-piercing noise. Shutting it off and turning it back on would solve the problem at the beginning, but it has increasingly become worse to the point where the sound is lost after a few minutes no matter how many times the TV is shut down and turned back on again, or how long it has been allowed to warm up. Another problem is that it recycles when first turned on, shutting itself off and then restarting repeatedly.Attempts to contact Philips have gone unanswered. I sincerely regret having purchased this TV and highly recommend that others steer clear of it!"
2,Poor contrast ratio.,"A friend bought this for his bedroom. Although they don't list the contrast ratio here, it's for good reason. The contrast ratio is very poor. My guess would be about 600:1, like the first LCDs to hit the market years ago. This is an old technology LCD of years ago. The blacks are only light grey/purple at best, never even close to black. It's like turning the contrast down on your current set, & then turning up the brightness. Everything looks washed out, especially during dark scenes. For watching movies, accept nothing less than a 1200:1 contrast ratio, or you won't enjoy it."
1,Dissapointed,"I have had this TV for almost a year now and in the last month it has gone wonkey. At first it started out with a lot of static when you first turn the TV on, but now whenever it is turned on it emits a very high-pitched noise, the screen goes in lines, and then it shuts of, only to turn itself on again and start the process over. It is really frustrating, and quite frankly, very hard on the ears.I contacted Philips about the issue and they have yet to respond. If you are looking for a good TV that will last about 9 months, this one is for you. If you want longevity, steer clear."
1,Bad News Keeps Coming -- Negative 5 Stars,"Yes, I'm one more victim of the Philips defective product company. Same experience as everyone else -- screeching, blaring sound, turning itself off, not turning on, pulling the plug multiple times. It worked for about two years, and I use it very little. Once or twice a week I watch a DVD movie, and that's it.Philips management must have learned their lessons from U.S. Bankers -- take the money and run.Go proclaim it from the highest mountain:PHILIPS IS RUBBISHI wish Amazon would enable a negative star review capability. I would give this a sure negative 5 stars. I resent giving it one star."
1,Terrible! Do not buy - Stopped working after two years,"As many other reviewers have noted, the TV was working fine for a year and then started turning itself on and off and making this high-pitched horrible noise everytime it was turned on. The TV would also freeze up in the process.We also bought a VCR/DVD combo (3340V/17) from Philips and the same issue occured. The combo would randomly turn itself on and off and would open and close the DVD holder multiple times before playing. These are terrible products! When I called Philips regarding the issue, the company would not fix it because the one-year warranty had passed. We are now responsible for paying out of pocket for repairs. Given the same consistent issue reported by other users, it is more than likely that there is a defect with these devices."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"Worked fine for about 18 months and then began having the same problem as so many others have experienced with this model. Upon turning on the set, it began emitting an ear-splitting screeching noise and shutting itself off and on again, over and over, all the while making the nearly unbearable noise. The repair (faulty power board) is as costly as a brand new set. Infuriating that Philips does nothing about this -- these televisions should be recalled."
1,Circuit City Replaced it with a Toshiba!,"I have had nothing but bad luck with this model. I bought it online and had to return the first set because it was defective and wouldn't work at all.I received another set. It worked okay but certain colors were overly saturated; mostly reds and greens. And yes, I tried to adjust it numerous times: always with no luck.About 14 months later I started having a problem. When first turning on the set, the picture would distort, make a shrill noise and the screen would go black. The picture would come back shortly after. This would occur 3 to 8 times before stopping. The problem was even worse with HD channels.I wisely had purchased an extended warranty. The service department said there was a problem with the display and decided it would cheaper to replace the set than to repair it. To my delight, Circuit City is replacing with it a Toshiba model. Hopefully my luck will be better. I will never purchase a Philips LCD TV again."
2,Not a great tv,"My biggest complaint about this tv is that it has terrible backlight issues on all four sides of the screen. It is gets really annoying seeing the white haze light.The only pro to this tv for me was that it outputs to 1080p for the PS3 like one of the reviewers stated above. However, it doesn't help when you are playing a game and notice that stupid backlight. Terrible, just terrible! I returned this to Best Buy."
1,Much smaller and cheaper than expected,"It's a fraction of the size advertised, only 16"" long, the image is hard to see, the sound is tinny and doesn't project, and to add insult, they don't even include any cables with the TV!"
1,FIXED this piece of junk,"For those of you that have problems with this turning itself off and screaching a dozen times during warm up, here's the fix:Take the back panel off, remove heat panel around the motherboard and the cable attached to it. Up by where the cable comes in from the power panel, you'll see 3-4 blown capacitors. They look like little black & gold beer cans, and you'll see how the top is domed, and/or the bottom is blown out. Any that look like this need to be replaced.I needed three 1000uf 10V, and one 470uf 16V. Got them from STSI.com for $8 shipped, and three days later with 15 minutes work with a soldering iron and it was fixed. Make sure you don't put them in backwards!! The stripe down the side is the negative (-) side--the board is marked for pos & neg.Yeah, it's still junk, but for $8 it was worth fixing."
2,NOT a Targus Security Anchor Base Plate PA400P,"After waiting for the shipment, verify that the model is not Targus Security Anchor Base Plate PA400P, is a copy of lower quality and the thickness of the hook is much thinner, not providing the same quality and safety of TARGUS, should update the photo the product they offer and waiting for the same product in the picture."
3,"Gets the job done, not as pictured","I've had the Targus baseplates before and they are very strong feeling and quite heavy for what they are. These, on the other hand, do not. They do not feel as strong as the Targus version and are likely significantly less secure. They still work though because someone is still going to have to do some damage to remove it...they certainly won't be walking off with it."
5,Fascinating View of the Resurrection,"David Pawson's ""Explaining the Resurrection"" is the most rational and plausible discussion of Jesus' death and resurrection that I have ever encountered. With his usual brilliant insight, Pawson answers questions and explains seeming discrepancies in the differing New Testament accounts of this phenomenon.I highly recommend the book to both Christians and non-believers. It will satisfy readers' curiosity and could be a life-changing revelation."
2,"Looks pretty, function is ugly","The good:Looks amazing. People tend to comment about them when they see em.The Bad:the guts are all plastic, with no way to adjust between course and fine. It does not make sense to me because I bought the brass version of this at the same time and it is a completely different product inside - metal guts, adjustable, solid.I bought the brass one for salt, and the copper one for pepper, I have them reversed now because the copper one cant handle the pepper."
4,It does the job,"If you need to make your aftermarket stereo installation completely reversible, then it's best to not dike out the factory connectors. These little gizmos do the trick for your aftermarket speakers; simply wire these to the new drivers, unbolt and unplug the factory units, and your new speakers are ""plug and play."" That's it.Note that some speakers (e.g., older Blaupunkt, Kicker, or Sundae units) may require these adapters to be soldered on, rather than simply clipped. But even then, doing so certainly beats trying to solder the speakers in directly.Also, Amazon's price is far better than buying them full price from a local retailer...assuming they even have them."
4,Plug and Play,"I've always spliced my speakers directly into the factory wiring. I figure I'd splurge on these, and was quite happy with how easy and clean it made the installation. The negative spade connector did fall off during installation, and the plastic prevented easy soldering thus the four instead of five stars."
5,Perfect for 2012 Civic EX-L,Made the replacement of the rear speakers with a pair of Infinitys almost hassle free for the 2012 Civic EX.
5,exactly what i needed,Bought my 99 Honda Civic ex and had new rockford fosgate speakers and didn't want to clip if I didn't have to. They plug right into the connector and work like a charm
4,Essential for any Car Audio Upgrade!,"Installed these adapter harnesses for a recent audio upgrade for my Honda Element, and they worked perfectly. Extremely easy to connect and ""install"" (literally plug and play). Definitely a far more easy route to take rather than having to splice the connections together.Would definitely use again for any future upgrades/installations!"
3,Not Bad...,"Not bad...I used these on Honda Civic 2012. Second quality product and Made in China. Clips and connectors were poorly constructed and hard to plugin so you have to push them forcefully. When you were using them you feel they are really Chinese made. Not much choice on market. However, they work flawlessly."
3,2002 SiR,"Not bad...I had to fix the connecting clips as they were poorly constructed, a few of the connecting clips (bought 2 sets) were not crimped properly and had to fix. However, they did make the install a breeze."
4,Cry for More,"This was yet another book I've had on my shelf for a while and decided to read. It has all the ingredients for a good series: a well-developed main character, a solid story line and believable supporting characters. Some scenes bordered on the ""cozy mystery style"" but I still couldn't put it down. I'm glad to see there are more in this series."
2,Already returned......,"The price for this watch is good, after I received the watch, the gift package is quite nice too, but, until I opened the small bag and took the watch out, I was rather disappointed, the whole watch just does not like new, compared with the one I bought from department store, and I found that there were two very long scratches on the band. I mailed it back yesterday and paid 10 bucks for the postage, hope I could get refund soon."
5,makes great sense to me :),"Marnia Robinson lays it out very simply in this book. I was already introduced into this method of making love through reading religious and spiritual texts, but this book helped me to REALLY understand the 'WHY's and the 'HOW's. How does a normal person like me ACTUALLY put these things into PRACTICE? That is what this book is good for, very practical. She not only explains the science behind it extremely clearly, but also she prescribes a 2-3 week program to get you and your lover started. This book came just in time to save me and my fiancee :) One of the reviews says reading this book was one ""AHA!"" after another, this is so very true.worth the $10 for sure!"
3,would benefit from a better editor,"While I found the information in the book interesting, and suspect that there could be a great deal of value in the process she recommends, I found the first 184 pages very repetitive. As another reviewer said 'she makes some odd leaps of logic', and the further she gets from molecular biology the more the anecdotes and information seem like confirmational bias. I wish the book were better organized, I'm curious to check out her newer book to see if it has improved."
1,Do not trust them,They will take three months to ship you anything. It is made in India and shipped on their timelines. I bought May 8 and it is now leaving India months later. I am still weeks from maybe getting my furniture. Avoid at all costs.
1,TOSHIBA SATELLITE A75 MAIN BATTERY,"DOES NOT WORK IN MY COMPUTER. I WAS AWAY FOR THE PERIOD DESIGNATED FOR RETURNS SO I MISSED OUT. COULD JUST BE A ""FLUKE"" ; DON'T KNOW."
1,Bad Luck,"I bought this battery for my 2 year old Toshiba Satellite A75-S209 after the original battery lost its juice. The laptop shuts down abruptly. It happened often. I tried it even after few months. When everything seems fine, the laptop shuts down. Have stopped using it now."
2,Very theatrical,It's ok but I would rather the reader wasn't so theatrical in his reading. Probably wouldn't buy again. Why can't someone read the Bible in a normal voice?
4,Good Scriptures to Hear,Many times sitting down to read is not an option. The beautiful Psalms in spoken form seem to penetrate the mind better than reading the same words again and again. The Proverbs are guidelines for everyday life and do seem to be heard as another way of learning. I especially hearing Proverbs 31.
2,Broke in less than a week,Bought this to use for a wedding. The little metal piece where the flash slides into popped off after a few days of practice with it. Super-glue seems to do the trick in putting it back together. Second star for the way it sits nicely against camera without scratching the body and having a knob that still allows tripod mounting.
4,"Interesting theory, but needs updating","I read this book in early 1987, when it was still new. I didn't think I was that much of a carb addict, but in 2005 I started realizing how many calories I was consuming in the form of bagels, pasta and the like--even though I didn't have a sweet toth. But within the last five years, things have taken yet another turn. What I thought was a carb addiction may really be an addiction to peptides released in the digestion of wheat gluten. And if that's so, apparently I'm far from alone. Not only that, but it's beginning to appear that other proteins may cause various people problems that are somewhat similar. I've been reading/hearing about casein-derived peptides, from eating dairy products. (I've pretty much eliminated all dairy, but at times in the past I may have been affected by this as well.) The picture may finally be coming into focus for large numbers of people, who have been suffering with something they just couldn't figure out."
4,Great for Begginers,"I ordered this mouthpiece with absolutely no experience of the trombone and i struck lucky! This does recieve dents on the shank, but does not effect the sound. Nice cheap mouthpiece!! Go LowBrass"
4,Everything it should be.,"It took awhile to get here, but is what it should be. RCBS products have always been quality. If someone is looking to do reloading look for RCBS products."
4,I really like this product,I really like this product because it has a mixture of oils it has sweet almond oil and mango oil which softens the cuticles of your hair
1,LSL is Terrible.,"Hi!This game was really, really, really boring. You play a bunch of mini games within this game, and they are totally lame. You repeat the same stuff over and over and over and over..... Don't waste you're money. Buy a XXX DVD movie, or buy a great game, such as Gran Turismo 4, Brothers in Arms, or Siren.cliffMCI"
1,Where's Al Lowe?,"I see that there is no mention of Al Lowe being involved with creating this. If he is missing, then I can guarantee you that the humor and gameplay quality will be missing as well, and online opinion would seem to confirm this.What a shame that Sierra wasn't smart enough to employ him. I was looking forward to a real LSL game, not a rip off."
4,Neat Item,"Good deal on this shot dispenser, very good item to have on home bar or light party use. Required some screw adjustments prior to use, but after some tightening, good to go"
1,STAY AWAY,please if you have any top shelf liquor dont put it on this piece of crap. This came to me as a gift which i loved.. the plugs dont fit into the bottles unless you got bottles with super wide openings... im saddened b/c i lost some nice single malt scotch to this crappy design. keep searching and buy something else.
3,Ummm...,"The product arrived to me in a box that looked like it had been tossed around by a bull locked in a cage. It looked the same in Bed Bath & Beyond as well. And they actually had the nerve to ship this item out looking the way it did! And I had to give it as a gift. I mean, really...."
1,don't buy it,Taps on the bottles are not corks like in a real bar. They are made up of rubber rings that do not fit snuggly into the bottle. I ended up dumping half a fifth all over my counter when one of them popped out. Might work well with gallon bottles but anything smaller and your risking your favorite beverage.
2,leaky,"Product arrived with a plastic piece broken,no problem to fix, but when I put some liquor in two of the dispensers they leaked before the end of the night."
2,hard to assemble,"I bought this for my house bar, the instruction were clear to follow but I could not get it to stay up like the instructions said they said to tighten the screws I did it stiill slipped down so I had to use my own diff screws to tighten so it would stay up to put four bottles on"
5,I love it,Stole this idea from my girlfriend. Everyone who comes to my place loves this little invention. I would recommend this to anybody that brings over company
4,bar,I've had the item for a year. It is a very nice addition to my bar. It was a good value for the price. My friend is a bartender and I bought him one too. He loves it. shipping was fast and prompt.
3,Not the best one Ive seen,Had this on my wish list and got one for Christmas. Put 4 750ml bottles in it and tried it out. It doesnt fit real perfectly tight in the stand and leans a little. Also the taps arent very high off the table top so it takes a shorter glass to get any liquor out comfortably. One of them started leaking but after doing some tightening I have got that to stop. Two of the taps are full flow and two just give you a shot. So far they seem to work. Id say its a neat novelty/conversation item but dont think I want more than one and probably wouldnt buy another of this particular brand if the one I have breaks. That being said it does look cool up on my bar.
1,title of book does not match the picture of the book,"THere is an error here, title and picture of the book don't match, so cannot order the book. Linda Wilson"
4,it seems to be a good product,it seems to work really well for our chickens and their combs are bright and healthy. Easy to mix in the water
3,At least I got it.,"Item was received on the last possible day before being considered late, which happened to be Christmas Eve. Packaging was worn, which can happen during shipping, but this caused parts of the dvd casing to be slightly damaged. Discs were in perfect condition so there was no issue with playing.Wrote an email to seller about product, which was never replied to."
4,Yardman tracked snowblower,"I have one of these and I love it. It has the grip to shove it's way thru a drift. In the transport setting you can do stone drives without picking up and throwing the stones.Also the machine self balances itself which really helps keep you up when you lose your footing. Very easy to start even without using the 120V electric start.The only down side to this whole machine is rarely it throws a track off at the worst time. It takes a 1/2"" wrench to put it back on, but your doing it oout in the snow at the time. The power steering is really a great thing as well. I am a tall person so the 6 speed forward keeps it up with my pace. Tracks are definitly the way to go if you can afford it. If I had to buy one again I would."
2,it's pretty short for 50 feet,"i dunno about you guys, but i swear mine isn't 50 feet.....15 dollars for 50ft cable is decent price compared to bestbuy, etc."
2,Its something,"It works,but the scroll in the mouse does not work correctly. It doesn't have good rage either. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Good product,No frills but all the basics. Only problem waspositioning of receiver. Kept getting falsewarnings about poor signal quality. Chose tosuppress the warning and have had no problems.
1,Daily Frustration,"A surprising disappointment from the Microsoft brand. Wireless reception was very unreliable, and each of the components (keyboard and mouse) required frequent ""resetting."" This late in the technology game, there are too many good options out there to be messing with this garbage. I returned mine and went with Logitech - better choice."
3,good but not great,"The keyboard is great. No glitching and the range is really about 4 feet with line of site. The battery life on the keyboard is also great, I have had it for four months and i havent replaced the batterys. The mouse on the other hand is a bit diffrent. In the four months ive had it the batterys have died twice. It glitchs, especially when playing games, and it is a bit small and not very ergonomic. Its a good product but i wouldn't buy it if you spend more than 2 hours on a computer a day."
4,Works great as long as you don't install the software.,"This product is pretty much plug and play if you are running XP or Vista. IT WORKS GREAT WITHOUT THE SOFTWARE. In fact installing the software actually makes this product function worse. By not installing the software, you will not be able to use some of the multimedia buttons (My Docs, My Pics, My Music, and the Media Play Controls), I never really missed these buttons any way.Its a solid product at a good price which does not drain batteries (batteries will last about 4-6 months). Mine even came with a bonus travel mouse which I use with my laptop. Recommended if you can live withs its quirks."
2,MS should pay YOU to use it,"I was really looking for some wireless stuff to keep my desk tidy, i really did not matter much about price, but for those few bucks all seemed to fit. And it was a MS desk of course, anyone would think with a little work you should get it going OK.Unfortunately not; the mouse is really unresponsive when clicking. It does ""wake up"" fast and battery has a nice life, but sometimes you click on some link and have to MOVE YOUR MOUSE WHILE CLICKING to make the computer recognize the MouseUp event.The keyboard, on the other hand is really great, I do know it is a little slow sometimes, but it is acceptable and that bought the second star on this review.For the whole Combo, I think MS should contact the owners and give them a brand-new, fine-working Keyboard and Mouse."
1,Hassel,"The first product i got didnt work, had to wait again before recieving new keyboard. Big big hassel with company now i need to send it back, wont do business again.sorry"
1,Terrible keyboard/mouse,"I agree with the comments on the key changes and on the mouse. Used mine for a few weeks, and then the mouse started 'going' bad. 10 clicks and it might finally 'click'. @@I had read all these reviews and still tried it...I suggest a different one. Am now trying a Logitech S510.Rho"
2,Very poor range -- Not a viable product,"The range on the mouse is less than three feet. Sitting on a standard office desk, the mouse drops clicks if it's more than eighteen inches from the receiver. This makes double-clicking almost impossible."
1,Worst Microsoft Product Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. I had an old logitech wireless that worked great for over 5 years (sold it with my old computer),but this Microsoft version needs to be reset at least 5 times a day and it constantly misses characters when typing.BUY A LOGITECH INSTEAD."
4,Wireless keyboard & Mouse,We had to buy another one. Apparently u need to be soft when using the keys because it broke due to overuse.
1,Returns Not Hassle Free!,"Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 1000 (PC & Mac)I purchased the Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 1000 keyboard with mouse from BuyDirect Corporation and after one month, it stopped working and because I could not convert my Net-book back to using the regular mouse system, I had to totally reinstall the operating system. The company made getting a return coupon number a hassle, so I ended up not getting it returned. My suggestion is that if the company wants to improve their customer satisfaction rating on Amazon that they should seek to make the return of defective products hassle free e.g. simply send a free return mail coupon upon email notification of the purchase of a defect product."
2,receiver's range is just plain crap,Theres a very very good reason why Microsoft doesn't do the small usb receivers...The keyboard and mouse itself is pretty decent definitely not ergonomic or anything but bearable.... however what really sets this combo apart from all the other keyboard/mouse combo's is the wireless receiver.... microsoft claims its 6 feet but I doubt its any more than 6 inches... also if you type with the keyboard on your lap and the wireless receiver is on the table then it won't register anymore....so basically what I opted to do was use a USB extension cord to hang this thing on the ceiling where the cord has to run through a lamp in the middle of my room honestly it looks more ridiculous than using a wired USB keyboard... so unless you don't mind having cables running through the center of your room and having oval chirstmas decorations hanging from your ceiling don't get this keyboard/mouse!
5,Thank You,Thank You for your timely service. I'm enjoying the keyword and mouse that I ordered. I still can't believe I got it so cheap.
1,Typing for you,I've had my keyboard and mouse for several months now and I am ready to throw the keyboard out the window. It types letters for you and it's extremely frustrating.
1,The worst thing Microsoft has ever produced.,This is worthless. The lag was horrible. It was not usable. Don't buy it. I couldn't even use the keyboard to type one legible word. I should have used it to type this review out so you could see first hand what you are getting.
1,keyboard does not work,I think using the mouse is fine but the actual keyboard just does not work. I was hoping to use it remotely but the range is about 2 feet. If I go any further it stops working.
2,"Wireless yes, Good no.","The product arrived from seller as stated in new condition. Upon opening with great excitement the huge USB receiver for the keyboard and mouse destroyed the mood immediately. After the aesthetic let down I plugged up keyboard and mouse to find the range was terrible. You have to have the receiver almost on top of the keyboard and mouse for it to work. After about a month of use the batteries died, and I grew tired of the hassle threw the set away and bought a new keyboard and mouse. Would not recommend the combo to my enemies let alone friends. Terrible buy."
2,Distance a problem,I am disappointed that the mouse and keyboard must be located with 2-4 feet of the USB connection to work. I had planned on using them at a distance of about 10 feet.
2,Wouldn't call this wireless,"The keyboard and mouse are not hooked to the computer with wires, but the receiver is and it has to be within a foot of the items in order to pick up their signal. So we can put the keyboard and mouse across the room from the PC, but we also have to stretch the wired receiver to just in front of them in order to use them! It almost defeats the purpose of having a ""wireless"" keyboard and mouse set.However, they do work just fine when the receiver is in very close proximity."
2,"Only somewhat ""wireless""","The keyboard and mouse are not hooked to the computer with wires, but the receiver is and it has to be within a foot of the items in order to pick up their signal. So we can put the keyboard and mouse across the room from the PC, but we also have to stretch the wired receiver to just in front of them in order to use them! It almost defeats the purpose of having a ""wireless"" keyboard and mouse set.However, they do work just fine when the receiver is in very close proximity."
4,Nice,thizz iz a pretty good Microsoft wireless optical desktopi will really recommend thizz to anyone out there that looking for one of thizz
3,It works,"I have 3 of these systems. They work fine, they can get picky about the placement of the receiver pod, but nothing to really complain about. pretty much as advertised. battery life seems really good."
1,Do not waste your money!,This keyboard and mouse are both low quality. I would recommend you go to a store and try it out first. The feeling on the keyboard is awful. The mouse is very cheap feeling also. The thing eats batteries so fast. The mouse will drift all over the screen. I used this item for a month then threw it away because I hated it so much. This is the first review I have actually felt compelled enough to write.So basically this thing sucks.
1,"Keyboard OK, mouse can't scroll properly","Have used a MS Multimedia Keyboard before so the keyboard could be said to be as I expected. However, the mouse is really bad. The scrolling is intermittent, and altho the scrollwheel is graduated, the no. of lines scrolled and the no. of bumps have little predictability correlation. My Logitech mouse feels much more natural in that respect, and perhaps I have also become used to using smaller mice so this mouse feels a bit unwieldy (and heavy).I don't know if I will return it since I primarily bought it for the keyboard. Reading the other reviews concerning the mediocrity of the keyboard and the set in general make we wonder why I purchased the set in the first place."
1,Mouse skips scrolling,"I bought this product and I am having tough times1) Mouse skips scrolling2) USB port acts weird, when this stuff is connected and I try connecting any other USB device it freezes the other ports and itself and the only fix would be to reboot the maching.I wouldn't recommend buying this model."
1,Not What I Thought,"I ordered this key board and when I received it, it is a French keyboard. I was able to use it until I could purchase a replacement but I didn't see where the description said it was French. Maybe I missed it..."
1,more plastic than value,Klunky. Oversized USB interface. If you use your keyboard alot this one won't go the distance. If it was heavier I'd use it for a boat anchor but it's been demolished. Best 20 seconds I ever spent. I will never buy Microsoft hardware again.
2,No go,Keyboard is nice and easy to type with. But for some reason the mouse always jumps on the screen and I tried to fix it but it's still not working. So right now I'm just using the keyboard with my old mouse
1,"OK Wireless Keyboard & Mouse Set ""Buyer Beware""","I purchased this wireless keyboard set as I am already using another one of these on another PC and it performs well. I like it better than the newer Microsoft model. Unfortunately I received a defective unit (mouse) from this third party seller and they expected me to jump through hoops to get it replaced, what a hassle! I contacted Microsoft directly and they took care of the problem immediately sending me a replacement. The only problem was that the replacement was the cheaper newer model. Still better that a defective unit. This third party seller has something to learn about customer service as I would Not Recommend them or any third party seller!"
3,Not What It Use To Be,"I've purchased two of these wireless mouse keyboard combos, one recently, and one a couple years ago. The one I purchased recently seems a little bit cheaper. The quality of the plastic and the scroll wheel seem a bit off. And it was thirty dollars back then. On the plus side the volume, mute, play and pause buttons all work fine with a Mac."
2,Terrible,"I bought this because a guy at radio shack reccomended that I buy a wireless keyboard/mouse for my mac. I use both Windows XP and Mac OS 10.4.7. This thing was great for the first week. After that it seemed like the batteries for the mouse lasted three days. Then after a month the keyboard started messing up but only when in Windows XP. I would push one button and it would type another. So after this frustration when I changed the batteries it was fine, however now it seemes like the batteries only last 3 days like the mouse. The mouse is more comfortable than a mighty mouse and the keyboard has some nice shortcuts but that simply doesn't save this terrible set. I guess you get what you pay for. My advice, buy a more expensive model."
1,Product would not function,"This Microsoft Wireless 1000 keyboard and mouse system would not function even though I installed the software as described. I then followed the ""read me"" instructions and uninstalled it several times trying to find circumstances that would work. Then I went to Microsoft's web site and downloaded current software and nothing, nothing, nothing worked at all after several hours of checking battery installation, uninstalls, downloads, etc. Gave up. I went back to my former wireless mouse (without keyboard, reinstalled it,. and it works fine so I know the wireless interface does work, just not with the 1000 system."
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"This set is good...if you plan to stay within 2 feet of the receiver, which most people don't. If you want a wireless keyboard and mouse that will work a farther distance, choose a better model. We were attracted to this one because it wasn't as expensive, but hell, I'd rather buy a wireless keyboard and mouse separate, pay $10 more, and get better quality that will work a farther distance. Not worth buying and is a waste of money."
2,I hate them,"As has already been stated, the range is Crap and RSI is inevitable from the constant smashing of the mouse into the side of your head with frustration.Shouting directions for the pointer on the screen has proven more effective than this odious little device.Keyboard works ok for me... Perhaps I'll try hammering the mouse with it!"
2,Poor Connectivity,"Pros:~>If you are on a budget and just looking for something quick and simple, then this is for you.Cons:~>If you are using for gaming purpose or large coorporate conference room purpose, find something else.Software Installation:1) For Keyboard and Mouse driver installation, it is very slow. (No its not my computer)2) For software setup, the selection of driver wording is poor and can be confusing for beginnersHardware1) The USB Wireless Hub is not like a USB stick driver. Its a hub with a very long USB extention2) Poor Mouse connectivity, It will skip unless mouse is close to USB Wireless Hub.3) Typing very fast causes missing letters.*I have found out that placing the USB Wireless Hub close to the keyboard and mouse reduces these problems, but whats the point having a wireless when the hub is closer to the keyboard and mouse.... sigh...."
4,Good for the money,"This set is great, and all worked perfectly except the wireless remote which is plugged into the computer via usb needed to be literally 5 feet away for it to work perfectly...not the best setup for a media center. Other than that it worked perfectly."
1,THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,"If you're looking for the SAX riffed song they're playing in Europe, this is not it. This is nothing but cheesy techno remixes. There's not one SAX riff in all the cuts! I had to bite the bullet on this one and buy the 'Destination Calabria' single. That's where the SAX riff and Crystal Water's vocal is."
3,Don't let the title mislead you,"The title of this book suggests that it is directed towards the crafter just starting out, but the wholesale trade shows it focuses on are out of reach for me. I recommend it for anyone interested in mass production for wholesale buyers, but if beginning crafteres are anything like me, shows like this are completely out of reach at this point. I was hoping for a book that would help with the issues I'm dealing with on a day to day baisis - like trying to start my business from scratch with no capital except from pieces I sell here and there; most of which must go into supplies for the next piece I'll sell, business cards, a good camera . . . etc. It's a bit outdated as well, and someone should inform the author that some of us do in fact remember macrame. (like the millions of hemp artists out there)"
2,needs map to fold,Most of the road I looked for were there. Key difficult to decifer. A nightmare to fold. Too big with back side blank where more detailed city maps should have been.
3,Ok but not right for us at all,"My daughter is 23 months and I was looking for a book that might encourage her to kick the pacifier habit on her own. I'm in no rush, I just wanted to get a head start. After reading all the positive reviews on here I picked this book.Unfortunately, it is very wordy - way too many words on the page for my almost 2 year old's attention span. Since it is so long, we never make it to the back of the book - so she thinks its a book about how fun pacifiers are. In fact, since my daughter only uses her binky at nap and beditme, little bunny gets to use his in all kinds of fun places she has never been allowed to before, so I think she asks for it even more since we got this book.Little bunny is clearly more like 4 or 5 and the book is geared toward that age level as well. So it was not at all what we were looking for."
4,beautiful,"This was given to me as a gift, it is a gorgeous bracelet. The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is one of the stones is quite a bit darker than the other stones. However it is still a quite stunning piece. The amethysts are sparkly and beautiful. The weight isnt too light and not too heavy, the butterfly clasp is a beautiful addition as well. I am very happy with this bracelet!"
5,Sweet memories!,I used to like this a lot when I was in jr. high school. One day I was shopping with someone who was checking out a fancy smancy perfume and it reminded me of Malibu Musk. I guess the manufacturers have a really good nose. It's a fun fragrance.
1,Never received product,Never received the product.Contacted the seller.They promised to ship out another unit.Never received that either.Will never buy from Amazon again or the seller.
4,Challenging puzzle,"Do you really want an ""easy"" puzzle? My kids and I do not. This was the kind of puzzle put in the middle of the family room and everyone spent 10-30 minutes a day working on. With a 1000 pieces and with a fairly complicated picture it was not ""easy"" at all. But, as far as puzzles go, it didn't have any impossible solutions."
5,You'll never forget it.,"This series starts with The Keeping Days, there are 5 books in this series. I read these books over 20 years ago (when I was 14) and they are still my favorite books. I wish that I could find all of the books in print to give to my two daughters. Intelligent, yet romantic look at a family in 1920's Yonkers. It is a series that you will cherish forever, never want to give away, and read again and again."
4,"A Fun Read--Yes, believe it!","Science books are generally drab, inpenetrable, and long. Gribbins' book is none of these. I found the book quite readable. The most complex scientific concepts are described in sufficient detail to tell the story, yet with clarity. He avoids math, chemical formulae, and jargon.Many scientific overview books, particularly those with sweeping titles such as this, are lengthy to the point of being imposing. At 220 pp, this is an easy read over a few days.If you're interested in understanding science from strings at 10E-35 meters to the size/age of the universe, you'll enjoy this book. As a chemist, it was illuminating to get a perspective on the other disciplines and scales of our universe."
2,slapdash,"I checked this book out of the library, and soon gave up on it. Gibbin has exibited a good, easy to read writing style in putting out a slew of science books. He should maybe slow down a bit. A book of this sort cries out for supporting illustrations, but has none. What it does have is a number of careless errors in the few early pages I read: He erronously refers to atomic weight, in a context where atomic number would be correct. He says e/m for electrons was found to be about one thousandth as big as that for protons, when he should have said about one thousand times as big. And so on."
4,Good,John Gribbin is an excellent author and this book reflects his skill in writing. A better book that sums up everything in science and that I also recommend is THE BIBLE ACCORDING TO EINSTEIN
3,Know what your buying,"The cables look good, but the product can't do what I expected. The advetisment seems to have some faulse claimes, or my understanding is in question."
5,Smart and Face-paced,"Smart heroine, tangled mystery, sexy soldiers, sprinkled with enough military jargon to make this an entertaining read. In the eBook version, typos, missing words, and incomplete sentences are mildly annoying, but overall the story is too good to put down. Anxious to read more by this author."
3,Wow.,"I have to admit that I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked up a copy at the airport bookstore(don't imagine they sell to many copies). Yet, this book held my interest long enough to finish it. I agree that the Cohens' disdain for anyone and everything tended to wear on me, but I guess I was waiting for the emotional turnaround--the point of closure when they would express some sentiment of being able to go on with a life not consumed entirely by hate. It never came. Still, the passion evident in this writing, although extremely negative, makes for a fascinating human story. Then again, ""feel bad"" stories are not for everyone."
1,What about the other 269 people who died?,"Is it just me or do these people need to grow up and move on? Sure, their daughter was important, but 269 other people were just as important. What the Cohens and their cohorts did to the children of Lockerbie is disgraceful. I have no sympathy whatsoever for these spiteful, hateful people."
1,"A truly dreadful book, of which the authors shouls bd ashamed","The trouble is that the authors do not have the slightest understanding about what Lockerbie is about, having swallowed the lies and fabrications of the US authorities. To correct them: The destruction of Pan Am 103 was an agreed joint operation of the governments of US and Iran to give Iran its one and only one revenge for the provably deliberate shooting down of Ir655 on 3rd July 199, which gave the Iranians a revenge according to their traditional law of qesas.They must be sympathised with for their loss. I lost a relative in a terrorist bombing (provably attributable to Libya), but the fakery of the 103 investigated is so crude, it beggars belief.The book deserves no stars"
2,Tends to grate after a while,"When I initially began reading this book I felt compassion for the Cohens. It is the same compassion that I feel for the many other victims of this bombing. It is the same compassion that I feel for all who fall victims to tragedy. But about halfway through my sense of compassion for these parents began to wane. Their daughter was obviously a fine, beautiful young woman and they have every right to grieve for the rest of their lives. But there is such a thing as dignity. The Cohens use this book as an opportunity to vent a series of spiteful and mean spirited attacks. Fine. Some of their targets deserve it. But what is truly appalling (and what lost them my sympathy) is their attitude toward the town of Lockerbie and toward some of the families of the other victims of this disaster.Hatred, vengeance, and bitterness are emotions that are more poisonous than cyanide. And the Cohens certainly prove that.This is a book to avoid."
1,"Touching, but too self-absorbed","Some very heartfelt moments in this book that make for an emotional telling of two parents lives following the bombing of PanAm 103.But in the end, that's all this book becomes....one grieving moment after another. It dawns on you after a while that even 12 years later these people have not worked thru the pain of their daughter's death. The result is that this book devolves into a never-ending emotional mish-mash. Surprisingly, by the end of the book I had lost most empathy for the Cohens and, as harsh as this sounds, found them quite pathetic.I also found it downright rude their back-biting of other families who did not share their passion for wallowing in the loss of a loved-one.A sad book.."
1,Try something else,"I had this book for my Statistics I class. I've read every bit of the instruction on the book (I read everything not just what's on homework). At the end I realised I learned nothing I was still confused. Unless you have a good instructor to follow you through every step, you should skip it. This is NOT something for at home students."
2,Not good,The examples are not clear and complete enough. Even my Stats professor said he didn't like the way the book was made. I know Stats involves a lot of word problems but the book is uncessarilly wordy.
2,Almost Useless,"I had to have this book for a college intro to statistics class. I'm not very math inclined, and this book was no help. The 'examples' are not clear and easy to follow.One of the things that I did find helpful in this book is when they list the steps to use an equation in text, without the numbers. Fortunately, the professor was able explain the equations.If you are trying to teach yourself statistics:1.) get a life :c)2.) don't get this bookIf you are getting this as a textbook for school:hope you have a good math prof."
2,Did not work with our laptop,"Pay very careful attention to this item before ordering it and make sure it works with whatever laptop you need it for. It didn't work with our laptop, so I had to send it back. Which was a pain--the company was a bit nasty with me via email, practically calling me a liar and claiming they had emailed me when they hadn't. And, to boot, they couldn't spell while being nasty (which isn't the end of the world, but I expect less obvious spelling errors from a business). Amazon stepped in and got my money back to me right away, so I sent it back, but it was a bit of an annoyance. If it weren't for Amazon's stepping in, I'd rate this lower, but Amazon customer service was the saving grace."
3,missing part,"dock seems fine, came without a power cord, they did send on, poor fit (right angle does not fit in slot all the way) but works ok"
3,want to love it but...,"The machines are TOOOOOO loose!! Everyone wants to hit a jackpot, but not every 5th spin. That saps all the excitement out of the game. Otherwise, terrific graphics, sounds, bonus rounds, etc. I'm willing to even say that some of these games are better and more exciting than the best video slots in the casinos. What these games need are an option like the Masque Games -- play authentic or high (i.e., unrealistic payoffs). I prefer Masque, but Phantom has, hands down, the best looking slots available."
4,"BUY, BUY, BUY!","Excellent game! I gave this game four stars, because there are a few things I would have added to the games, such as a description of each, number of lines, max amount to play each game, and a brief description of each game. I don't like the poker games and the bingo game. Overall this edition is super. The graphics are excellent, realistic like casino slot machines, and the added suprise bonuses makes this game more fun. It is an excellent product for the cost. Anyone who likes video slots will not be diappointed. EFX beats their competition hands down. I can't wait for the next edition. BUY, BUY, BUY!"
5,I couldn't wait,"I could hardly wait to get my copy of Nickel Alley from Phantom. I have all of their games and this is by far the best. If you want some real fun, this is the one.I read the review about customer service at Phantom. I got a response within an hour when I tried to contact them about one of their older games. It was not their problem, it was mine and they helped me fix it. You do need a little power for this game, but running it on a laptop has not been a problem for me."
4,Just like the real thing,"I'm really enjoying this software. I get to enjoy gambling without spending any real money-last night I even made $50,000!!! The games are realistic and fun (some more exciting than others).I like being able to change the currency denominations. My only complaint (if you can call it that)...the games are alittle ""loose."" In live casinos, I don't think (no, I know) I would be hitting as many jackpots and getting to as many bonus rounds as these games allow me. It's beginning to lead me into a false sense of security when I actually do go to a casino.If you enjoy casino nickel slots, you will enjoy this software. It's definitely fun and exciting without emptying your purse.P.S. I haven't made it all the way through the Prize Vault yet, but I'm on my way. Some of the requirements to pass through are alittle steep-might get there in a year or two."
4,ENJOYABLE GAME,"I OWN 11 REAL DEAL GAMES FROM SLOTS,CARDS,AND CASINO GAMES AND I ENJOY PLAYING ALL OF THEM. NICKEL ALLEY IS ON MY TOP FIVE GAMES. IF YOU CAN STILL FIND IT BUY IT BECAUSE YOU TOO WILL ENJOY IT. THANKS"
1,Not for high-end laptops,"I was really excited about this collection of slots, but unfortunately, it doesn't run on my laptop. I emailed Phantom EFX, but received no reply and ended up returning the game. It appears that it is unable to deal with the laptop's resolution as are nearly all games from this company and from Sierra.I also tried another slot game from this company with the same results. I guess I'll stick to Masque Publishing's games which work flawlessly on my machine."
