5,Awesome!,"I hit a construction workers hard hat at 70 mph about 2 years ago with my little saturn ion. Since its a Michigan car, the hard hat hit the rusty ""elbow"" of the exhaust pipe right in front of the CAT Converter and made a few small holes. After 2 years, the car was getting so loud that I started sounding like a broken Harley. Anyway, I finally tried this putty for $3 on amazon and bam!!! Shes purring like a kitten! The guy at Goodyear told me I had to replace the entire section for $500 so I'm more than happy with this product. I didn't start the car per directions cuz I didn't want to blow a hole in the putty. I let the car sit for 24-36 hours and then fired her up. Sounds new again! PS Go get yourselves some Rhino Wheel ramps for $40 at walmart and stop jacking up your vehicles! Well worth the $40!"
4,Beautiful Choral Music,This CD by a women's chorus contains a range of interesting music including a challenging tone poem by an Australian composer.
5,"Very Romantic and Inspiring...Muy Romantico, una buena voz.","This CD is one of the best cd's I recently have bought(Ricky,Enrique,Cristian etc). If you are in a romantic mood listen to tracks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10, if you want to get inspired, track 8. Javier has a beautiful voice that makes your skin tremble."
1,Huh??,"I found this while searching for Jerry Lewis' ""Who's minding the store"". What the hell is this????"
2,"Good start, bad ending","Ventus starts out very promising - good prose, good characters, good setting, great science - but halfway through it seems the author decides his characters aren't important, or not as important as the plot and science. Characters we come to enjoy fade or nearly disappear while new ones jump in and steal the stage, though they are obviously just tools to move the story-which they do poorly. The end of the novel is a jumble of characters running to collide while spewing lengthy monologues about the meaning life, man's relationship with nature, and several other deep thoughts which are hard to care about. Overall Ventus is disappointing."
1,An Unsynchronized Mixup,"It would appear that Mr. Schroeder could not decide what sort of book to write: fantasy or science fiction. In the end, it is like most compromises, neither fish nor fowl. The first fifty pages were boring. Then again, so were the next 150 before I finally gave up. Ventus gives new meaning to the requirement to suspend disbelief. It is simply tedious. Save your money for a good book."
3,Ultimately doesn't work,"The story of Ventus is engaging but ultimately unsuccessful. Despite strenuous efforts, the author can't tie the story together with his chosen message/theme. There's always a problem when an SF writer attempts to write about beings with supposedly godlike powers and knowledge, and then tries to describe some revolutionary idea that they all missed. How can he think of it, if they can't? Schroeder does especially badly at this; apparently, all of the thinking power of various godlike AIs isn't sufficient to reveal what a relatively uneducated and not particularly insightful human can figure out just by sitting around in a room with some original information archives. Maybe there's a way to make this plausible, but it didn't make it into this book.Still worth three stars for everything else in the book. The writing and concepts are excellent; they just needed to be directed toward a story that makes more sense."
4,Intriguing science-fantasy,"(...)I thought it was an intriguing book, one that starts out deceptively akin to a standard fantasy, but which quickly transforms into something much more interesting.With an engaging set of characters who undergo substantial shifts in circumstance and morality throughout the book (a rare phenomenon in standard fantasy, and welcome here), a good, swift pace and a really interesting piece of world building, Ventus is a piece of science-fantasy that is a credit to both genres."
1,Doesn't Work - Bottle was leaking,We followed all instructions and it simply didn't work. The bottle was leaking when arrived so I am not sure if the product was spoiled or if it just doesn't work at all.
3,Not what I expected.,The ball was purchased for my daughter to pitch withinside. We've had the ball for the past few weeks andit's not held up the stitching is coming apart.
5,Fabulous!,"This is a fabulous example of medieval a capella singing. It was used in a literature class of mine, and I liked it so much that I decided to purchase it. I haven't been disappointed. The voci bianche of these singers almost brought me to tears. Definately worth buying!"
5,Unmatched Machaut,"I'd forgotten this disk in a corner of my collection until I heard an concert by another group, Liber UnUsualis. I reviewed their CD ""Unrequited"" quite enthusiastically, but then I searched for ""The Mirror of Narcissus"" and listened to the two head-to-head. Results: both good, but ""The Mirror"" is more intense, more passionate, and more artful in articulating the hockets and other effects of Ars Nova heterophony. If Gothic Voices ever had a reputation of being ""academic but dull"", that was a bad rap. This performance is fiery."
4,MY OPINION,"I REALLY LOVE HIS CD! CAUSE ITS NICE , SMOVE AND MELLOW. I HAVEN'T FROM HIM FOR QUITE AWHILE. I LIKE HIS FIRST CD AND I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM SINCE. I HOPE HE'S WORKING ON ANOTHER CD AS WELL. BUT I REALLY WANT THIS CD. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF U EVER GET SOME! THANKS!"
4,A good start,"I have found a lot of needed skills for learning to inlay wood. This book is easy to read, and understand. Good book for someone wanting to learn this art."
4,Not an exciting thriller . . .,"While not an exciting thriller to while away the night,Or a romance novel full of love's first bite,The Federal Personnel Guide is heavensentFor dealing with your employing government.For CONUS, FERS, RIF and FEHBP (that's health)The Federal Personnel Guide is literary wealth."
3,Teach Yourself Some HTML,"Teach Yourself HTML is a simple guide, almost too simple. Though most of the basic rules and tags are explained, which is good for the beginner, it's bias in Netscape's favor, which, down the road, can lead to IE conflicts. The chapters parts are listed in logical order, however, the chapters themselves don't seem to follow a logical path. Nothing is mentioned about web page design, pros or cons, and many of the illustrations don't give a good sense of good web design. All in all, the book is good for beginners who don't mind making a few mistakes down the road. It can get the student a head start toward more advanced HTML."
3,Better than nothing,"Just bought a house and wanted a more secure mailbox. Got this and my complaints about it are that it doesn't come with long enough screws and no washers at all. That wasn't apparent when I purchased it. Also, the door although seemingly sturdy can be easily pried open. The door is not secure any other place but the immediate area of the lock so you can easily pull the door to either side and pry it open. I think perhaps if you are able to drill big enough holes to install 2 additional mailbox locks on either side of the original lock this would solve the problem. I am hoping that this mailbox will serve some purpose and possibly ""deter"" the average identity thief since my husband will not allow me to purchase a more expensive and possibly better mailbox. This mailbox is better than a non-locking one so that is why I gave it an average rating."
2,Locking Mailbox,"After inserting mail in the slot the flap does not come down on it's own you have to manipulate it by hand, and the mailperson is not going to take the time to do that. A metal tab meant to hold outgoing mail keeps the flap open. It is a very nice looking unit but a little inconvenient design issue."
3,Large mail box - Missing parts,"Large mail box, great if you are out of town for several days.Magazines fit without the need of folding.FYI... the box of the mailbox is plastic.Arrived with missing keys, and missing red flag. I noticed another review also had missing parts. There seems to be systemic problem at the manufacture doing the pick-and-pack.Very prompt and easy replacement from Amazon. All is good now."
2,Lock is theft deterrent only,"As a mailbox, this is a good product. As a SECURE mailbox, this definitely falls short. We had ours broken into, figured the lock just wore out or something though so we bought a new one. In less than a week it was broken into along with our neighbors who had an identical one. We now are looking into a more secure box.If you're looking for something more secure than a normal mailbox, this is better only because it locks. Buy at your own risk though is there is a theft problem in your neighborhood."
2,Waste of Money,This book was a waste of my money and my time. The writing is awful and it provided very little insight into the day to day life of an attorney.
4,Good buy,"Cute, edgy, useful and comfortable. The only problem is that the long boot shape combined with rubber material really doesn't breathe or allow much air circulation...wear socks and expect sweaty (but stylish!) feet. DON'T wear these in really cold weather without good wool socks because they offer absolutely no insulation. I wore thin cotton socks with these in Chicago in December, and my foot was so cold I couldn't walk properly."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because I generally love books of this genre that tell you how to live life. However, this one left me wanting more. Maybe it was the lack of recommendations for books, movies, etc. for inspiration (which I always love), but I was thoroughly disappointed. Try ""The Bombshell Manual of Style"" by Laren Stover instead."
5,I'm a Princess! Say it loud and proud!,"This is a clever book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. Some of us were just born Princesses, and this book helps us embrace it instead of shun it. Never again will I feel guilt when someone calls me a ""Princess"". If the tiara fits, wear it with pride!"
5,Surficial Geology - Building with the Earth,"I purchased this book in 1981 as a required text for Environmental Geology. It turned out to be the single most important reference book that I use as a geologist in the Environmental and Geotechnical consulting fields. Some of the conceptual and legal aspects of the environmental sections are dated, but most of the topics covered provide information that is applicable to real world geological and civil engineering problems."
1,Lame.,"Bought this book to help me (as a graduate nurse) write out a resume ... There was a single page that pertained to the information I was looking for and it didn't really apply to me that much. Ended up looking online for what I needed, so basically this was wasted money. It's a book of all different kinds of nursing, from CNA to specializations in the nursing field, which would be good for someone looking for a very specific kind of resume. But not worth the $15 .... can get it for $8 on other websites, like Half dot com, so I was not a happy camper with this purchase. Next time I'll just use the internet to help build my resume."
3,Warning! Sizes Run Small!,"Although this a good price, you get what you pay for. They tend to run about 1/2 size smaller than normal. Of course, they will shrink, even though they are preshrunk. It's a great price for a cheapish shirt. However, I expected that when I ordered it. I think the quality is somewhat better than Hanes or Fruit of the Loom."
5,Singin' In My Soul,Recieved in a timely manner. This is one video that will have you singin from the beginning to the closing credits..
3,Cheap and cheerful,Good size surface area. Bit thicker than I like - makes them feel a bit like they're from a bygone era.The Fellowes mats are better in terms of thinness.
1,Godawful smell,"This neoprene pad has an awful smell. When you use your mouse on it, the smell transfers to your hands. I find myself washing my hands every hour or so to keep my eyes from burning.I would not buy this again, and I recommend you not buy it either."
1,The smell....ouch!,"It is quite decent and soft. The size is great too (Almost 10""X 8"") but the smell is sooooo strong (Chemical smell that I can not tolerate). For the time being, I'm keeping it by the window for another week, although I doubt the smell will just go away."
5,Its a mousepad what more do you expect.,After getting this mousepad i was quite happy i did have to cut it down for it to fit on my desk but it does not slip and it feels like its giving my mouse and nice boost in responsiveness.
5,Awesome Basic Mousepad,"I can't speak for durability, but my mousepad (black) is a good size and feel. The bottom is foam, and the pad doesn't slide around on my desk. I can't say much more about a mousepad."
3,Great basic mousepad but a little expensive,I was looking for a cloth mouse pad since I am not particularly fond of the glossy ones that people can print on. I find that I have better control of my mouse on the cloth mouse pads over the glossy ones. I actually could not find one at my local Staples so I ordered one off of Amazon. The product is great in that it serves its purpose. I just wish it was cheaper because I might be an idiot but I thought it was $3.99 for 3 of them but it is actually just for 1!
4,Easy,"If you are looking for just a plain little mouse pad, I would suggest this. I throw it in my laptop bag and bring it where ever I go. It is much better than not having anything at all."
2,"Nice, but thicker than described.","The product description for this mouse pad states that it is 1/8"" in thick. After spending to time to find a nice plain black mouse pad for the right price, I was disappointed with it. On the plus side it doesn't slide on the desk and the fabric top is comfortable. However, it's reminiscent of the 90's. If you're looking for a lower profile pay a few extra bucks and get another one."
1,A knockoff of The Art of Sensual Massage,For the real thing...check out The Classic Art of Sensual Massage video. Enough said.
5,Simple is best.,"This is a nice simple yet decorative set of chopsticks for light use. For the price they fall right where most occasional users need them. Better than the freebies at the Sushi stand, more economical then fancier ones.Excellent value for use or decoration.."
3,slick stick,"These chopsticks are very slick and very difficult to eat with. They are much prettier than the basic bamboo, but the basic stick is much easier to eat with."
5,Great,"I got these as a small Christmas present to myself and absolutely love them. I have smallish hands, and they're not too big and clumsy for me to use comfortably."
2,Beware of chipping paint!,"They are a bit slippery to hold but you will get used to them. We are an asian family so we use these chopsticks a lot. After 6 months, the paint is coming off at the black tip and we will be throwing them out and replacing with bamboo chopsticks. Check the tips of your chopstick before using each time to ensure you are not eating the paint."
2,Okay,"Even though the company stated they were brand new, they arrived scratched and looked poorly made. It turns out, they're only plastic sticks with decorated paper wrapped around them. It's also hard to eat with them because they're so slippery and thin at the ends."
2,From Awesome to Disappointing,"I loved this product when it first arrived because it was inexpensive, goregeous, and efficient. In fact, I loved it so much that I order another set.Unfortunately, after a month of use the chopsticks have become bent and are impossible to pick up food with. It's heartbreaking but I am going to throw them away and buy some blend steel ones."
3,Wagner ThermoQuiet Brakes,"Great Stopping Power, however ceramics brakes have an annoying squeal when the brakes are young."
2,Disappointing followup to Foundations of Delphi Development,"As a followup to Tom's excellent book for Delphi 1 called ""Foundations of Delphi Development for Windows 95"" (although I hasten to add there was very little Win95 content given D1 was for Win3.x), this book was very disappointing.Tom set an extremely high standard in his D1 book which just was not reached in this D4 book. The D1 book had extensively commented source code which I found invaluable (I still refer to this book today). The Delphi 4 Bible does not. The D1 book was very comprehensive. The Delphi 4 Bible is not.On balance, the Delphi 4 Bible is not a particularly bad book, it just does not distinguish itself from any of the other D4 books that are available."
2,Good for beginners,This book was a greatly dissapointing. If you're an expert at Delphi this book is not for you. If you're just starting out than you may find this book helpful. The manuals that come with Delphi provide more in depth information than this.
4,A failed reedition of the best Delphi Foundations Book,"It fails even if the text have improved because one of the best points of ""Foundations of Delphi"" was the commented source code. The editors seem to be in a hurry to print this one and forgot this essential feature of the original book. So you need the original to benefit the most from the code. Still a good book anyway but not deserving 5 stars as it's predecessor. I'm very disapointed with the loss in readability of code."
5,"It is not just book, It is Tom Swan Sharing with you...","If you are a patient and systematic beginner in Delphi programming this book is suitable for you. If you are a skilled programmer and try to look for some special topic this book also is great for you. It looks a like that Tom Swan personally seated with you in front of your PC and telling you what to do with your program source, talking about a lot of hints and jokes and even when to stop for coffee break or lunch. Simply it is great."
4,An Entertaining Read,"I enjoyed this book while curled up with a steaming cup of tea and a cat on my lap. I found this book to be a fun, witty, puzzler. I had several suspects picked out and was mildly surprised when the criminal was revealed. This book had some laugh-out-loud moments and I liked the interactions with all the characters. When I finished it, I picked up the next book in this series."
4,Oy Vey,"Loved this, a bit risque', for my taste, but a sense of humor as always wtih Rita...Have several more to go!"
3,Great series,"This is the first book in the Gladdy Gold cozy mystery series. I like to throw in some cozy mysteries in between heavier reads because I enjoy amateur sleuths. I found Gladdy and her group of ""Gladdy's Gladiators"" a fun mix of spirited older women. While a couple of her crew were annoying, isn't it this way in real life as well? I thought I knew who the murderer was, as well as the motive, but I was wrong. I loved the feel of Ft. Lauderdale in the book, as well as when they get fired up and speak Yiddish.If you enjoy cozy mysteries and want something light and fun, this is a good series to get into. I know I'll be back for some more adventures with Gladdy very soon. The 7th book of the series comes out at the end of this month so I have some catching up to do. [....]"
3,A fun mystery,The writer of this book had a great idea when she cam up with Gladdy Gold as a senior citizen private eye. It is obvious that this is the beginning of a series of books. I thought it was fun and entertaining. I even bought the sequel. I recommend this book.
3,First book,Ihope this is the first as it promises to be a good series. I read a great deal & will certainly look for more by this author
1,tedious and profane,"I found the main character annoying and unbelivable, as she appears much too clever. Maybe if she solved her crimes completely by accident it would be believable, but outsmart the police? It is also somewhat offensive to make fun of the things she does--the senility and forgetfulness in old age, joking and laughing about death and funerals. The sense of humor is an attempt at being silly but it is offensive. Living in this kind of environment where one is losing friends and family to death, the loneliness and sadness found there, is a topic and setting of bad taste. My guess is the author herself does not live under such circumstances, but when she does, maybe she won't make jokes about it anymore. Just another example of how people in our society take lightly and joke about things that should be taken seriously."
5,..but getting old like Gladdy is great!,"This book is a hoot. Gladdy Gold is funny and smart, with just the right touch of feisty. Her friends make the kind of mischief I want in my life now, let alone when I'm their age! This book is a good story, but it's a great read because these are people I want to spend my time with. Especially Gladdy--she's a character I want to meet again and again. This one will put some Florida sunshine into a wintery weekend. Dive in and snorkel for the answer to the mystery! Thanks, Rita Lakin, for Gladdy and all the great entertainment you've given me for years on the big and small screens. More, please!"
5,Tape around the World,"Great seller. Quick ship. Precisely as ordered. Except that I messed up and bought much too much tape; enough in fact, to go around the equator. Oh well,."
4,Unexamined area of American history,"I purchased this book because I enjoyed Lleyveld's work at the New York Times and thought his autobiography would be of interest. It proved to be interesting for other reasons, as well. Firstly, it provides a glimpse of what it life must have been like for rural Jews in early-20th century America. As a native of Alabama, I've wondered how life must have been like for Jews then, and this book certainly answers that question. Also, as a reporter, Mr. Lleyveld is able to research his early years and effectively establish or disprove the validity of his memories. This proves very interesting and he deserves a lot of credit for this. It must have been very difficult to rely on objectively researched clues for the story of his life, instead of his own memories, especially considering that oftentimes his own memories proved false."
1,jamsalot,"I purchased a fr350 nailer from home depot because of nice features. I shot 1 box of nails and it tried to shoot a nail out backwards. returned the nailer to home depot they tried to clear the jamb and ended up exchanging the nailer for a fr350a. shot a box of nails had a jam and was able to clear it. A year later it shot another nail out backwards, no way to clear it. Out of warranty but unit was purchased with credit card and they agreed to pay for repair. I obviously would not buy this gun again. My other gun is a bostich n80s it has shot at least 1000 boxes of nails and has NEVER jammed. thinking about trying the n88rh1"
2,"touchy trigger, jams easily","I bought this gun reconditioned and it is by far the worst of the 5 guns I own. I used it a few times before it stopped working. Porter Cable fixed it for free, but I had to wait a few weeks to get it back. It also has a very touchy trigger-I often accidently double fire nails. Finally, its very big and heavy. I definitely don't recommend this gun, although I have had very good luck with other Porter Cable nailers."
5,Extraordinary English choral music,"This was the debut recording of the Requiem of Herbert Howells (1892-1983), paired with a sensitive recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams' (1872-1958) Mass in G Minor. Howells initially wrote his Requiem in memory of his son Michael who had tragically died in 1935 (at the age of nine) of spinal meningitis. It is an intensely personal and intimately expressive work which was essentially kept from publication until 1980. It is interesting to note that this recording was completed in February 1983, less than two weeks before the composer himself died at the age of 90. The other Howells piece featured is the less well-known Take Him Earth for Cherishing, which he was commissioned to write in memoriam following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It was premiered in 1964. Matthew Best and the Corydon Singers have provided what is in my estimation the definitive recording of this deeply moving Requiem."
2,"It had a good premise, but ends up confusing and a dull.",This book is about a Palestinian journalist under house arrest. It had tremendous potential to be an interesting look at their troubles. Their plight is often ignored. But the book constantly changes time and scene and leaves the reader confused and uninterested. The story never really develops.
3,not bad,"Not bad. Not that great, either.What I liked about the book was the detail. A lot of books don't really address srotas (channels), dhatus (tissues), and the dosha's aspects, seats, and signs of imbalance in the same detail which this book has.I also like the solid factual basis of the book. The truth is that a lot of Ayurveda books dwell on really abstract ""absolute consciousness"" philosophy and then lay out treatments the authors invented themselves. So for an honest and down-to-earth discussion of Ayurveda, this book also deserves recognition.The down side is that this book is dry. Unless you're really, really interested, you may struggle. The doctor does not have a very imaginative style."
5,"Great, hulking book of illustrations",I would recommend this to anyone wanting some classic illustrations for web development. I'm considering cutting the pages out of the book so I can scan them better and filing them in a box for later. The pages are super heavy duty and very nice. To scan a full page would take a large format (11 X 17) scanner or greater.
2,the complete encyclopedia of illustration,"The book is good condition BUT the book probably was reprinted ( exactly is recopied )that the pages and pictures are not cleared and sharpen enough for viewing in details. Anyway, it's not easy to see the original printed book as the first time of publishing. Thanks."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A pretty dirty, nasty, crime caper. The art style by Cooke is more in the Powers vein. Catwoman is broke, and takes on a heist that is way over her head. Unsurprisingly, she displays overconfidence, and things do not go too well. Shades of 100 Bullets almost. She manipulates a man she likes into going to work for her, an ex-boyfriend, and when really, he should shoot her, his emotions or hormones get the better of him, leading to the latter half of the story."
3,"Big Score, Big Disappointment","Selina's Big Score finds Catwoman out of costume and broke. The story here is a straight forward read, cut from the same cloth as a million train robberies. I had no previous knowledge of Darwin Cooke's run on Catwoman, reading his interpretation of the character for the first time.Cooke's art is fantastic, and to be considered the major selling point of this book. A Batman Animated style merged with Paul Pope, it's made distinctive with a particular storytelling flow. There seems to be great emphasis on the design and pacing, but the story itself lacks the expected punch. The colors are extravagant and fitting, and I was noticeably impressed by them.This book pales in the shadow of Batman:Ego, but the comparision is unfair. Although it isn't presented as such, this story fits into the continuity of an ongoing series, which leads to missed significance. Casual readers be warned!"
5,Inspiring,"Brunetti discusses in great detail the different things he has done to treat & cure his lymphoma. He refers to the kitchen as his pharmacy & steps the viewer through the creation of his smoothies & special herbal tea. He discusses vegetable juicing & a number of supplements. His approach to diet seems wholly consistent with Sally Fallon's ""Nourishing Traditions"". I was left thinking that his cancer hardly stood a chance given all he was doing. I am doing many of the same things in an effort to rid myself of my lymphoma."
1,Do not waste your money,OTC The Legends of the USC Trojans appears to be a junior high school attempt at a sports documentary. The menu items do not work properly and some of the video appears to be a digitized version of a television recording. The volume of the music was inconsistent and competed with the monotone voice of the announcer. The text scrolling across the bottom of the screen was a major distraction to the video highlights.
4,"Get some culture, Hispanic-style!","These 73 ""points"" on Hispanic Culture give insight in areas you may have puzzled over. The alphabetical arrangement of points may seem awkward, e.g., the second point is ""Approaching strangers in public to ask something,"" but it does yield a pleasing eclecticism.And there's a fine index to zero in on particular topics along with a helpful bibliography. The emphasis is on ""little-c"" culture -- those subtle elements of behavior in daily interaction that can add to culture shock if not understood. The points pertain to the entire Spanish-speaking world, and distinctions are often made between different countries. This will be a great help to you if you are traveling in a Spanish-speaking land.Passport has put out other books in this series: The Russian Way, The German Way, The Italian Way, The French Way, etc. I've gleaned fascinating tidbits from several of them, but haven't found them intriguing enough to make part of my home library as I did The Hispanic Way."
3,living la vida loca,"As a Hispanic/Tejano, I wanted to check out this book to see much were familiar to me as well as checking out the similarities/differences between countries or regions. I found this book to be interesting but not enough to be satisfied.However, I was confused on how this book alphabetized on aspects of the Hispanic life. So, you get lessons in cultural norms, holidays, Spanish and others in random order. Perhaps it would have been better if there were separate categories in different aspects of the Hispanic life or in countries/regions.Overall, good book with some interesting tidbits of the Hispanic way of life."
2,Hispanic vs Latinoamericano,"This is a common misunderstanding. People from Mexico, Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, etc., only have in common the language, and the religion. Those came from Spain. Our cultures are different in many aspects."
5,Wonderful recording by a musician and scholar.,"Christopher Page is probably the most knowledgeable person in the world when it comes to early music, so it stands to reason that this recording would be definitive. Luckily, it is also beautifully performed! One of my all-time favorites."
5,anybody out there?,"i can't believe nobody else has reviewed this great recording! choral music by abbess hildegard of bingen (1098-1179) performed by a collective calling themselves ""gothic voices."" what an incredible recording of choral work. the medieval age of sound is brought back to vivid life by these wonderful singers. this is completely mesmerizing stuff. i give it my highest recommendations to one and all. truly a desert island disc of choral beauty and perfection."
5,Boisterous society,I enjoy this album because it represents my life and the people involved with it.
1,unlistenable,"If your idea of great music is out of tune guitars, incompetent drumming, and vocals done by a violent schizophrenic (unless he is medicated), and a guy who seems like he wishes he was still a kid, then this is for you.."
5,Sellars and Clarity,"This is a good book which would serve well as an introduction to Sellars's dense ""EPM."" It provides background information on sense-datum theories, a contextual overview, clarification (i.e., shows the arguments) in each section of the text, and offers insightful commentary on each section. ""EPM"" is included at the end of the text.I highly recommend this book, along with Sellars's other work, and McDowell's Mind and World."
2,what is this all about?,the commentary writers are offering here is crowded with the details of Sellar's essay and quite at no point supplies a general foothold to make Sellar's work and what's original in it understandable (which I finally can not appreciate how philosophically original it is).
5,Promise Me Tomorrow,"This is the second book of a 3-book series. The first one is ""A stolen heart"" and the third book is ""No other love"". The characters of her books are vividly written and seemingly alive. I have read all three and this book is just incredible. The story of the series is about three brother and sisters who were separated since they were young. Will they find each other? Read the whole series and find out for yourself."
5,Enjoyable read,"Stolen from her parents at an early age, Marianne Cotterwood lived a life of poverty in an orphanage. Now she's brought herself up in the world, as a high society thief.While at a party of the ton, Marianne poses as a wealthy widow, but in actuality she's stealing from the ton. When caught by Lord Justin Lambeth Marianne tries to brush it off. But Justin isn't so easily dismissed.PROMISE ME TOMORROW is a light hearted, fun book that every regency lover will enjoy. The added mystery of Marianne's birth adds to the story. Highly recommended."
5,Another great book by C Camp,Promise Me Tomorrow is an absolutely wonderful book. The storyline is great and the characters are well developed. You will fall in love with them! Once again Ms. Camp has told a story about a young lady who can stand on her own. It is so nice to read about a woman who is not weak or timid. Marianne has a mind of her own and uses it well. I don't want to tell too much of the story because I don't want to give anything away. This is definitely a must read book by a wonderful author. This is a fast-paced read that will keep you up at night until you're finished!
3,disaster,maybe easy for others. did not work for me. not worth the money or the time it took to discover it was a sticky mess.
4,Great Customer Service,"This vendor did it good job to cater to my needs. The silicon based glue was good, it did it's job very well. Though, try to use it where there is not a lot of wind. I did mine's on a windy day, and it was pretty messy. Make sure you have cleanwipes or a damp towel around to do immediate cleanup at unwanted areas."
2,soporific,Tempo on the first movement of the string serenade is much too slow. Wind serenade is not very peppy. Overall I prefer the vinyl performance I have with Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt.
4,Excellent quality!,"I haven't installed it yet, but It does appear to be well constructed. very classy looking too!"
2,Don't Bother,"I was sadly disappointed after reading this book. The authors blame everything wrong in education on an oversimplification of the bell curve. Furthermore, the blame is usally placed on the teacher from their standpoint, when teachers have little control over who is in their classroom.The authors do have great ideas, such as ungrading the school system and multi-age classes. However, the book was so full of contradictions and questionable ""facts"" that it is hard to take it seriously. I recently read ""Measuring Up"" by Daniel Koretz and found so many flaws in the authors logic whenever dealing with scores, assessment, and the bell curve.Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells UsI suggest reading ""Measuring U""p instead of ""Poisoned Apple""."
3,More of a Poster than a book,"This is not a book with ""pages"" but is a hard covered poster. Unless you intend to mount it on your wall (the hard cover comes with nail holes) you may find that it is awkward to handle. The problem with this book is in it's design not its content which is clear and engaging."
4,Needs hooks,"Very popular with children, but the removable items should come with some sort of way to hook them up, or you'll very quickly end up with a half-missing collecion of body parts."
2,A Very Negative View of Anne Boleyn,"As a historian, I purchased this book for my daughter, hoping to present her with an account of a flawed woman who struggled to bring reformation to the church. Instead of a subjective interpretation by the author, Anne Boleyn was vilified. Those looking for a story about a young girl in the court of Henry VIII might enjoy it."
2,Loser Deal,"My Brother gave me a few DVD games-Deal or No Deal, Price is Right and this one--of the three, the Deal is weak...SO LETS NOT MAKE A DEAL!I love Monty Hall. When I was a kid, I use to watch Lets Make A Deal..and love it! I would play along and say make the deal, watch out, etcNow to the DVD game...Even through it has host Monty Hall which brings back memories of the clkassic show. However this DVD seem to repeat itself and gets boring really fast. and there are more zonks than prizes. I will take door number four... the one not playing this game--and if you are smart you will tooIf you take this DEAL, you will be the WEAKEST LINK-BYE BYE!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
1,Very small,"Nice case however, very very small. Sent it back because it was not big enough. Contacted the seller twice about a return receipt and never received one. Sent case back about two weeks ago and paid postage myself and still no refund or communication from the seller. Don't order this if there is any chance you may want to send it back!!!"
5,Will touch your heart,"This is the true tale you bring out when your teen is complaining about not being able to go shopping, etc. Christine would do anything to live without Cystic Fibrosis. She does her best to live her dreams and we see her courage through her struggle come to life on the pages. What a wonderful tribute Jacquie Gordon wrote for her daughter. This book should inspire us all to reach for the stars and live each day like it might be our last.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
4,A text for the advanced student,"A long time ago I had this text for an extraordinarily difficult course in error correcting codes. As an introductory text I found this one too difficult. An engineer more skilled in the art that I talked to liked it. While I have trouble rating this item , I can accurately say that it is not a good choice for beginners in the field. It may be good for the advanced user. A rating is required for posting so I will give it a 4 based on others opinions. I had a better start with Lin/Costello's book.1/7/2007"
5,Basic and Complete Text for 1970-era Error Correcting Codes,"Appendix C Table C.2 (Irreducible Polynomials of Degree <35 over Galois Field(2)) makes this book worth the price. Suddenly, instant (and maybe obscure) scramblers and random-number generators up to 2^35-1 length (10 seconds at 3.3GHz). Suddenly, that XILINX(tm) scrambler for degree = 12 that they've been giving away for many years can be checked, and you see it's not really maximal-length!"
3,Can anyone measure?,"Hooded bathrobe was quite nice, but I ordered a Small/Petite size and it is more like a Large. I checked the label and it did show ""S/P"" so I am wondering what good are size charts. Bathrobe itself is fine though I did think it would be a little more plush"
2,Got it but wasn't impressed,"The price was good, the wheel is yellow and big enough for my large hamster. The wheel is not straight and I cannot get it to straighten out so it runs wobbly, but the hamster does not seem to mind."
2,Exercise Wheel,"Super loud, The dynamics of it are so odd creating a bouncing effect that create even more noise. other than that an okay wheel i guess."
2,Very Cheap and Flimsey.,"This wheel was only a little over $6.00 so at least I didn't waste too much on this purchase.But you know the saying, ""You get what you pay for."" and I certainly did in this case.The steel is kind of thin and flimsey. My wheel was crooked when attatched to the wheel stand. I had to bend the stand bars a few times to try and get the wheel on straighter.The bars on both sides of the wheel worry me concerning my Hamster getting his foot or leg injured but he seems to be doing ok so far.On the brighter side, he is enjoying his runs on it.I will be purchasing a better quality wheel soon so will end up using this one as a spare."
1,DO NOT BUY,very poorly made. The wheel wasn't even circular it was lopsided when i got it and in trying to straighten it out the welds on the metal easily came apart. Do not buy.
5,Review of few words,"This is one of the greatest choral performances ever set to disc, if not the greatest."
2,Bruckner Motets,"I am a choral music educator. I bought this recording because my choir was currently preparing Virga Jesse floruit. The notes and rhythms are accurate. The tone quality of the choir was offensive to most of my singers. They are used to hearing good boy sopranos and countertenors, however, these soprani were definitely in the shouty, over sung category. I recognized the Hyperion label and thought I would be getting high quality. I was only able to play it once and have not listened to the other selections on the recording. This cut was a very uninspiring performance of a great work by Bruckner."
1,I want my money back,"Now I've always been a die-hard brady bunch fan; I love the show and I love the first 2 movies. This one I couldn't even finish. It was a horrible, horrible movie.Unfortunately I couldn't take it back and demand my money back because DVD's are non returnable after opened. I threw it in the trash."
2,Disappointment Compared to the First Two,"I totally agree with ""Barry"" a previous reviewer who nailed this on the head. The original Carol and Mike Brady actors from the first two film saves this from sinking like a lead pipe. The girl who plays Marcia is good, Jan ok, but the other children are completely mis-cast. The actor who plays Greg acts and looks more like Peter. Peter and Bobby simply share no resemblance to the true characters and have few cameos because of it. I thought the first part of the movie was confused and strained. Better plots are available. Some of the original series plots are brought forth, but never really captitalized on, except for the ""slumber party"" which was well done. This attempts to be as funny and comedic as the first two films, but fall short in depth and cleverness. Fans will want to see it...but take my advice and rent."
1,The Brady Worst,"The only reason I bought this DVD is b/c it was a Brady Bunch film and...came as a set with Growing Up which is an awesome movie.Well,let me tell you this movie is just awful! I mean the actors couldn't been worst casted, Greg looks gay, Peter is fat, I think Bobby somewhat fits the original (Lookinland)Marcia and Jan act so fake and Cindy looks like she is either a midget or she is four years younger than Bobby.Alice is freaky, she doesn't resemble either Ann B. or the one from the 2 brady movies and her acting is just horrible, she is not cheesy...she is stupidMike and Carol are the dearest Gary Cole and Shelly Long, these two actors are good, they do resemble the original actors, I don't have any objections about themThe producers better think of making a new Brady movie b/c if they expect to have this film as the last one....The Bradys are dead!!Don't buy it!!! for your own sake!!!!!!"
1,GARY COLE CHANNELING ROBERT REED GETS A STAR,"The only reason to watch this installment of the Brady Bunch Movie Franchise is to marvel at Gary Cole's dead-on impersonation of the late, great Robert Reed. This from a guy who once played an all-night radio talk show host on TV? Cole even physically resembles the Brady dad.Too bad everyone else makes you moan for the originals. Though, I must admit, the producers/casting directors keep on getting great Marcias.Oh, and the plot -- others have stressed that the plot is ludicrous and patently improbable, but that's not the real problem. The issue is this: would Mike Brady REALLY behave this way? It doesn't matter if you have to suspend disbelief; this is make-believe, after all. But a scriptwriter's first rule is DO NOT VIOLATE THE RULES OF YOUR CHARACTER'S UNIVERSE.And in the Brady Universe, Mike and Carol would not behave as they do in this flick."
3,Far Out!,"This movie wasn't that bad.I like it better than A Very Brady Sequel.Marcia and Mike were good.Everyone else was too old,young,or just didn't look like the character."
4,What you need to know to be pro,"Not so much of ""How I did it"", but more of ""How you can do it"", which is actually more important.Aimed at selling your software in the mass market, gives lessons and ideas for selling through publishers and superstores, but not much about selling direct, especially on the web, maybe next printing revision.Lots of good ideas, and if you haven't started on your software idea yet, this book will make you want to start.Very easy reading, and thin too! Good for the midnight programmer / day tripper."
1,Disappointing,These 'dancers' just wriggle on a super-imposed backdrop. The models are very average and there seems to have been no direction to pose or perform. I bought this DVD because I already owned two 'Primal' DVDs that had been filmed in the wild outdoors and there is no comparrison in photographic quality. The models there were very hot too. This new DVD was for me a complete waste of time and money. Sorry.
4,All american college jocks,I luv DVDs with All american college jocks. More More More! These guys were as hot as the guys I see on campus every day - except that I can't watch them naked I could watch these awesome guys.Give me more of this!
2,not what I expected,"While this product does what it should (keep the hay off the cage floor and out of the animal's urine/feces) it is MUCH smaller than I had hoped. You have to refill it very frequently and once some hay has been eaten, the remaining hay falls out and is wasted. Perhaps if the back were solid instead of grated and the feeder actually larger, this product might be a better buy. The price of ~4$ was reasonable for the product."
1,i never got my package,they charge me i never got my package from this people never got a problem b4 but i dont know who to call
5,Great,"I love this product, never buy an air filter again. I have an iceman cold air intake with cone filter"
4,Great dishware...,"We bought both the blue and the salmon sets, and mix and match when serving. They complement each other very well. The dishes are beautiful and substantial, and there are a lot of matching pieces to fill out the set and have a put-together looking table.Our one complaint is that they seem a bit prone to chipping. We don't go easy on them, or treat them like heirlooms, they are used as daily working plates in our house, so it may just be expected wear and tear. And even with that slight quibble, we love these dishes!"
3,"Mostly Green, Not True Blue","I have had Pistoulet dinnerware in my cart forever, trying to decide which color to get and waiting until I could afford it. I ended up ordering the ""blue"" even though it cost more. Three days later, the price dropped, of course. I have an odd assortment of dishes, and was excited to get a set. The colors seemed so cheerful and easy going. When the set arrived, I was thrilled that it was well-packed and completely intact. But as I took the dishes out, I realized the predominant color is a limey green, not blue. Green and yellow. Only the dinner plate has the wide, rich blue band. The rest have only smidgeons of blue. I think the quality is very good, but the description ""blue dinnerware set"" is misleading. Really study the photo before ordering. If you want a true blue set, look elsewhere. Oddly enough, I may go back and get the red set too. Having one of each will cut the green factor, and that seems easier than packing it all back up and returning it."
2,Sweet Valley Twins,"This review refers to the Sweet Valley Twins book. Apparently there are two books of the same name being reviewed here. As for the Sweet Valley Twins book, I don't think it was the best of the series. It's about a new girl, Nora, who moves to Sweet Valley from Pennsylvania. The new kids tease her and make her feel unwelcome. I didn't like how mean they were to her. For example, a popular girl, Lila, stole Nora's homework and claimed it was her own; Lila framed Nora to make it appear she was stealing; several boys planned to vandalize Nora's home on Halloween... etc. I wish Nora had actually stood up for herself, instead of taking the rudeness. However, all is happy in the end because the kids at school eventually discover that Nora is a normal person like anyone else. I enjoy the Sweet Valley Twins books, but I don't think this was one of the best."
2,not bad,None of the really early Sweet Valley Twins books are as good.A new girl comes to town and everyone calls her a witch.
3,Decent text,"I enjoyed reading this book, it is very much an introductory text. Fairly simplified explanations. Most suitable for beginners to palmistry, intermediate learners will pretty much know everything in here."
5,Fantastic Collection of Rucker short stories!,"This fabulous book of short stories is a must have for all those who are true Rucker fans. 57th Franz Kafka contains dozens of short stories most of which were originally published in various Sci-Fi magazines at some point in the 70's or 80's. For fans of ""Master of Space and Time"", this book contains numerous stories about the same two main characters. I found this book of the similar integrity as ""White Light"". For those who did not like the 'ware series that much, this (as well as White Light) may be more your speed. Some of the short stories involve complicated mathematical concepts (big suprise!) or familar fables such as a revisitation of Flatland! If you can locate this book, I would HIGHLY recommend getting it."
5,Skin Replenisher,I've used this product for about 10 years and am very please with the outcome. I am 60 years of age and receive compliments that I look much younger. I recommend this product to anyone who wants their skin to feel and look good.
5,The card is AWESOME !,"I put this card in a system with an E6600 and 2GB of ram and was able to play Bioshock in DX10(Vista) at 1680x1080x32 with ""everything"" maxed out without a single hicup. Not one glitch in frame rates at all durting any battles. I see people saying get the 640 MB version for 1600x1200+ resolutions but after researching the benchmarks( e.g.-Tomshardware),the 320MB card matched the 640MB card in all benchmarks and beat it in some including resolutions at 1920x1200x32.I also fired up Oblivion with max settings at 1600x1200 and it played flawlessly as well. This card is an absolute steal at under $300 and you can always SLI with another down the road when you choose for even greater performance.Grab this card if you cannot afford the GTX version. No need for the 640MB version and the extra $100+ it will set you back."
5,muy buena targeta,Exelente targeta la uso para el flight simulator x con un quadcore y 2 gb de memoria y va fantastica muy buena.pero con windows vista no rinde bien tuve que pasar al win xp y hay si dio buen rendimiento y fue mucho no es muy buena con vista mi motherboard es asus strike streme.con vista no va muy bien pero en xp vuelaaaaaaaa
5,Loving it!,Well this card can handle most of my games at 1280*1024 (now 1440*900 since a got a new ws monitor) everything on high 4AF/2AAThe official drivers aren't that great but the lastest beta ones from nvidia do the job :)
4,EVGA e-GeForce 8800GTS 320 MB PCIe Superclocked,"This is another excellent product from EVGA! I have owned a few EVGA products, they have excellent build quality and have performed flawlessly. At the time this was the best card for the money, it has now been superceded by the 8800 GT 512MB (which I now have) or the even newer 8800 GTS 512MB with higher clock speeds and more stream processors.(128 vs 112)(As always keep an eye out for new products with better features!)"
2,Was not into it,Music didn't speak to me and the one song (Maracatu Atomico) that got me to buy it was a different version for which I did not care. Gave it away.
4,Interesting more as a historical document than a cookbook,"Many of the recipes are re-treads from recipes that are out on the internet. A few are original. The book really shines more as a history book then that of a cookbook. A lot of what was then considered ""gourmet"" fare is now just ordinary cooking. This is interesting in itself as you can measure the sophistication of the American palate through time to the present day. Some of the ingredients which were commonplace then are highly suspect or not used in contemporary cooking (Accent, for example). The result is some modification to certain recipes found in the book. Fresh ingredients were defined differently when these recipes were created, as a result, the variety in the local supermarket is far better than when these recipes were used. The book is still interesting though and well worth having on your library shelf."
3,"Does the job, but nothing to whistle home about.",It is fine but we could have done better price wise at a local sporting goods store. Shop around.
1,Flimsy piece of crap,"Very weakly built, it broke within a week. The lid doesn't attach securely and, held only by one tiny hair of plastic, broke. Also, the chip is exposed and thus vulnerable. It doesn't make good connection with the card, so the damn thing will read only when it wants to! I had to fiddle with it and pray to it to make a connection, and even if it did it was unstable.What a cheap piece of crap. Please save yourself the headache and get something else."
1,Horrible View of Theology,"I was very skeptical when I read the authors brief summary in the beginning of this book. He states the views are from people from every walk, ethnic and ""sexual orientation."" That automatically threw a red flag for me. The view on homosexuals is jaded and far from Divine viewpoint. One reviewer was absolutely correct when he stated ""it is a place for liberals and Christians to meet."" Saints don't compromise leave this book on the discounted shelf."
2,"Bought two of these wheels, both broke","This is the perfect size wheel for my hamster, but the first wheel broke after 3 months, and the second one broke after three DAYS. In the market for another one now.."
2,Too tight,"I bought one of these for my syrian hamster, and there is something not right about it. The thing was hard for my hamster to turn, and would often get stuck on itself to the point where the hamster could not move it at all. When he could get it to move, it was loud and wobbly. I've since ordered a different kind of wheel (Super Pet Hamster Silent Spinner 6-1/2-Inch Regular Exercise Wheel, which I've had before, and not had a problem with), but for now, for him to have something to run in, I had to file down the plastic post that the wheel sits on to loosen it up for him."
4,the best wheel out there!!,"I have had multiple wheels for my little pocket opossum. This is the best one yet. The others were noisy and dangerous (wire wheel) and I had a silent spinner that made a bunch of noise that he eventually broke. This one doesn't make too much noise as long as its secured to the ground and has all plastic parts so its easy to clean and won't get seized up from getting it when washing. There is only a little bit of noise from it jostling around, nothing too bad to handle though. Don't waste your money on other wheels this ones the ticket!!"
2,Rats love it. I hate it!!!,"This wheel is NOT whisper quiet. I just purchased it this afternoon and right now I am listening to it turn while 2 of my children are complaining about not being able to fall asleep because they can here it. It is better than the metal wheel the cage came with. I was putting WD-40 on it every other night to try and quiet the squeaking. I am returning the ""Comfort Wheel"" to the store tomorrow."
1,Extremely loud,My hedgehog wakes the whole family at night. It's ridiculously loud and she even has her own room now. I put weights to hold it down in place and lots of foam to keep it from shaking and it's still deafeningly loud. I can hear it through my earbuds at night clearly. No clue what else to buy.
2,Not very good for sugar gliders,"My gliders can only run about 2-3 rotations in this before being thrown out of it. It is extremely loud as well as unstable--we have to bolt it multiple times in the cage or else it moves about 1-2 inches with each rotation. This wheel is also difficult to clean if your pet poops a lot, which sugar gliders do. After forking over the arm and leg for the stealth wheel we saw the difference between the two. It's like night and day; you get what you pay for. This wheel is now on its side in the cage and is serving as a ""kitchen"" area where the food and water dishes reside."
1,IT'S TERRIBLE!,"Oh, great. I just wasted 10 dollars... :( It's wobbly, doesn't turn well, and it's everything but quiet. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Your little buddy deserves something better."
5,Buying this one again because I loved it!,"To start with it's a lot quieter than a regular metal wheel. The comfort is not only comfort, but safety for rodents with longer tails like gerbils, rats, and mice. Because they can catch their tails in metal wheels, I like to buy this brand for my rats. They like it, and the smooth interior surface is easy to clean. While some may chew the plastic is durable as well so that it lasts."
1,Noisy as all get up,Super noisey - Cheaply made (not calibrated at all it moves in a wobbly circle and even cooking sray cant quiet this thing. The hamster likes to run at night but it is so noisey I have to turn it over till the morning. I would only recommend if you have a pet room far from your bedroom or spend more for better quaility
2,Just okay-Cheap material and Noisy,"Very cheap plastic and construction and very noisy. Seems like the more my hamster runs, the more it rattles and the wobblier it gets. I wish this was as nice quality as some of the other wheels this company makes."
1,Look Elsswhere -- I could have sworn the reviews were good...,"I bought this item because i thought it had a solid set of good reviews. I was wrong I must have made a mistake and bought the wrong item. Even for only $8.61 this thing is a complete waste of money. It does not spin well, plastic on plastic, and the stand is horribly flimsy and wobbles. POS for sure and just a warning to you other customers."
2,SLIDING WHEEL,"I don't like this product for 3 reasons........... #1. Product too loud when the Degus are running on it. #2.There is NO way to screw the wheel in the wire cage so that the wheel will not slide when they are running. #3. The wheel is a ""Chewable"" plastic that the Degus are able to chew on............No Good.Sincerely,Amy, ""Comfort Wheel"" customer"
4,"Sturdy, but slightly hard to turn","Its size is perfect for my longhaired hamster sunny, he does have a kind of hard time getting It to spin sometimes."
2,Well... At least the hedgehog likes it!,"We're using the 12 inch version. The wheel wobbles a bit and had to be both screwed into the cage wall AND needed the stand underneath to keep it reasonable stable.. And it still wobbles. There's nothing ""whisper quiet"" about it, its pretty loud, not as bad as metal wheels, but pretty close. It's also very difficult to detach for cleaning. The only good thing about it is how much my little hedgie loves it.. All night long, on that loud wheel."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my adult sugar glider and it was a complete waste of money. First of all, it will not fit the bars on the cage so I can't attach it to the side like I had planned to. It is completely unusable on the stand it came with unless you can find a way to securely anchor it to the bottom of the cage. Every time my glider tried to use it the thing would wobble and scoot around until my glider got thrown out, making it impossible to run in. It is also incredibly difficult to spin, for a pet wheel. My glider can actually climb up and sit on top of it, and the thing doesn't even turn or throw him off."
5,Nice Wheel,"I have no complaints for this wheel. We have had it for close to 2 years now. It was noisy in the beginning, but I just dripped some olive oil on that area and it has been fine ever since. My daughter owns a Syrian hamster who is nearly 2 years old. Her cage is in my daughters room and she is never woken by it. Her room is directly above ours and we have no complaints either. Great wheel!"
2,Loud wheel!,We've owned several wheels and this one by far is the loudest. It's so distracting that we had to move Zoe out of the TV room.
2,Not the best!,"i bought this for my hamster because her original one was too small, yes this is a big wheel but the quality of this was not great, theres no twist on the back to attach to your cage so i had to pull thing together so itd stay, then its very hard to turn so my hamster did not get the hang of it, so i got rid of it. i am not very happy"
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this because everyone says it was this great wheel, but the wheel I got does not spin very easily and my little hamster can't run on it he just sit in it. waste of my money."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY! NOT RECOMENDED!,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT TELLS THE STORY OF CALUM INNES, WHO WAS FEATURED IN THE BEAUTIFUL AND SENSUAL ""FASCINATION."" UNFORTUNATELY, THE 'MAGIC' HERE SEEMS TO BE MISSING. IT REALLY DRAGGED A LOT--I STUCK WITH IT AS LONG AS I COULD AND ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE WAY, I GAVE UP."
2,Weak without pumice,"This was a cart-filler for me to get free shipping, and as such it was pretty cheap at the time.I would not purchase it again, although it does an OK job for light handwashing after auto repair chores. It has no abrasive, by design, which means it just can't hack the heavier grime that gets embedded it the hand wrinkles, etc.Permatex makes a similar product with pumice, and I've been satisfied with that."
4,Good Price Good Product,"I was somewhat hestitant about if our dogs would be able to use this door. Two long legged 35 pounders, a lab mix who weighs in at 45 pounds and a W.Va. brown dog who tips the scale at 65 pounds. However, it's not problem at all. It was easily installed and looks good. I prefer this one to the more expensive one I have at home."
5,"PetSafe Quick-Fit Pet Door, Medium White","This is a really nice product and it works very well. It keeps the cold air out and warm air in and does what it's supposed to do. We had an older one for years which was identical to this one and our new pup chewed it up so we had to buy another one. You can buy with confidence, all you have to do is cut an opening in your door, which isn't too hard if you have the tools and some basic skills."
3,"quick fit pet door, small","From the dimensions and the picture of a poodle using it, I thought sure all our 6 cats would fit through it...wrong! The larger ones could squeeze through, but they weren't happy doing it. This size is great for kittens and lean cats. If your cat is over 10 lbs. go with the next size up. On the plus side, it was very easy to install and operated quietly when in use."
2,These things don't last long enough and cost too much,"Sure, they work fine (thus 2 stars instead of 1), but toner is a crock. These guys sell the machines at a loss to make up their profits in the consumables (toner) and that is lame.I buy a new cartridge when I have to, but I refill (or send it off to be refilled) whenever possible. Spending this much for a toner cartridge makes me cry, and we copy on the lightest legible setting."
1,The toner is defective and damaged my printer,"The canon cartridge from this order is defective, there are small pieces of plastics leaking out from the toner, along with the black ink (or dust particles). The rollers and many parts of my printer got covered with the black ink. It had damaged my printer to the point that my prints have many black spots and strips on the paper. I only found this out with the new toner I got from Amazon as the replacement of the defective toner. My printer can't be used anymore, and I have to buy a new printer."
1,Never delivered,"This product was ordered weeks ago and finally got an email that said that they no longer stocked this product. So, never delivered."
3,motion maze,"I was happy to get the purple colored motion maze but when i took it to work, i noticed that it was a little too wobbly and not too steady on desk top. It would of been better if it had a flatter base, but it was fun to see people play with it while at work."
2,Defective??,"Received it in the mail today. Played with it for 5-10 minutes. I DID NOT DROP IT and it did NOT receive any other type of trama, but when I came back 10 minutes later, it had managed to crack in 2 places and leak all over. I started cleaning it up, and before I could finish, it had a 3rd crack in it. Will update review when we get a replacement."
4,great for kids,all three of my kids love this. It is great to see them intrquied over how it works. It is not a true one minute timer as we tried to use it for teeth brushing but the are still interested in it 3 months later
3,Color in motion....,It is just okay! I thought it was capable of something else.... What I do not know... lol! But it ias interesting....
1,Not what I expected,I purchased this book for a five year old and I still don't think she would find it at all interesting. I am not returning it because it's not worth my time and money.
5,Love all 4 of his books we have,WE LOVE Ed Emberly's books. My 6 year old son was never into drawing and since buying Emberly's books my son is starting to take what he learned form the book and is now coming up with his own artwork. The books really simplify drawing different things though the use of shapes. We LOVE THEM so much we have bought 4 so far and my son is asking for more!
5,Great product for OT,My 9 year old has sensory integration dysfunction and we use this at home along with smelly stamp pads for his occupational therapy play time. Ed Emeberley's books are all classics.
5,Make A World,"My son who is an artist commented recently that he wondered what had happened to his childhood Ed Emberly books. Thirty years and many moves later they were no longer around. His birthday was approaching so I ordered this book. He was totally delighted. He related that he credited much of his early success in drawing from using the step by step forms to create more complex drawings. He also delighted in introducing his nieces to this drawing style. It was a great homecoming and a ""pass the torch"" moment from one generation to the next."
5,Ed Emberley's Drawing Book: Make A World,Easy to follow instructions. I understand why his books are so well recommended - I will do the same for others.
4,As good as I remembered ... my kids aren't as enamored as I was,"It took a long time for me to track Ed Emberly's books down with just my memories from 30 years ago. When I found them, I immediately had to get them for my kids. They like them, but it doesn't hold their interest as well as they did when I was a kid. Probably a generational thing.Sometimes, my 5-year old will break the book out on her own and do some doodles. She leaves them on my nightstand for me to find. It's cute."
4,"Good to boost a lagging campaign, not a necessity","I found this book to be handy and very well organized. It's definitely got some very useful information for Keepers. I agree with the other gentleman here, though, that this is a book players will want to avoid. This book is like a set of Torx-head wrenches - much of the time, you will probably not need it. However, every so often, there are times when it is PERFECT for what you need. If you are just starting to run the game, the creatures in the rulebook should hold you for quite a while, though."
5,Why Hasn't She Made it in the USA?,"I haven't liked a whole album this much since Liz Phair's WhipSmart. If you need to catagorize her, she's kind-of a mix between Sheryl Crow and Cathy Dennis. Inexplicably, I've yet to hear any of her stuff on any local radio station. If it wasn't for Pandora, I would have never heard or Rachel Stevens at all."
5,America: Meet Rachel Stevens!,"Rachel Stevens debut solo album will get you up and dancing! In traditional brit pop style, Stevens adds a new funky, sexy, edge to it. Some Girls is a wicked track, great lyrics... Funky Dorky and Sweet Dreams are just as fun. I really recommend this album! Girls have fun singing along and teasing the boys!! And guys, well Rachel is beautiful...."
1,Not the same cd Amazon has listed,"I love this album and Rachel, but I gave it a low rating because this is NOT the version that Amazon listed. This version of the cd does not have the Sweet Dreams My LA Ex Bimbo Jones Club Mix on it, and this it a total rip off because I bought the cd for this mix. Thinking it was a hidden track I opened it and now I am out $26.00!!! Amazon needs to update the info on their site more often and be aware of their product. Sorry for the low rating, like I said the album itself is definitly 5 stars."
4,A raucous sci-fi adventure & standout in the Dr Who series,"Craig Hinton's first two novels for the Missing Adventures series ranks, I think, as some of the most imaginative Dr. Who fiction to date. Hinton clearly realizes that the success of the books hinges on the expansion of the Doctor's universe outwards from the confines of the BBC studios, and he achieves this admirably in a bizarre tale set in the distant future involving a time-travelling restaurant, the murder of the most powerful man in the universe, a resurrected saviour, and of course, the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough. Kamelion makes an appearance, to boot"
5,The Star Trek Reader II,This is a good book. I like it because it has novelized eight different star trek episodes.
5,Ragheb Alama,"What is there to say about Ragheb Alama that hasn't already been said? His voice is pure seduction! When it comes to music from the levant, whether it be from Isreal, Lebanon, or Jordan, Ragheb is the artist that stands out among the rest.To me he is the male version of Ofra Haza. A legend in his own time, he is able to remake his sound every turn of a decade and never miss a beat!! I never get tired of listening to him. Unlike American and British pop that vomit new faces constantly and produce the same song over and over again, one gets to be involved with the sounds of Ragheb Alama, a sensual artist, a beautiful voice, and mercifully (at least in America) an artist above the playing fields of all the other pop poops in the tabloids and potty rags!!"
5,Makes a work space look more organized,"I really needed this for my office. It makes filing so much easier plus, it keeps the messy piles of paper compiled in one easy to find place until the filing is done. It's a bonus having a legal size desk file becuase then papers don't stick out."
1,Outright Nonsense!,"I received a copy of ""What Happened on the Moon"" directly from the producers as I gave David Percy and his assistant a tour of the Goldstone tracking facility and was interviewed on camera by David in December of 1997.I worked at the Goldstone Manned Space Flight Network station during all Apollo missions and was an eyewitness to those historic events. However, this DVD is filled with half-truths and total fabrications about the Apollo program. It will only be of interest to people who like things about ""Area 51,"" ""Crop Circles,"" Roswell ""UFO's"" and other weird ""happenings.""Anyone who has even the slightest knowledge of photography and physics can see through the so-called ""facts"" presented in this fabrication. It should be considered a work of fiction instead of an independent view of a historic achievement.Bill Wood, Retired Tracking Systems Engineer, Barstow, CA"
5,juicy truths,"It resonates as truth to me; see if it does for you, if you are interested in this.The scientific analyses shown and discussed are thorough. It is a bit ""slow"" for the first 15-30 minutes but when they start to go in depth of the analyses, it gets juicy!"
2,Empowering Couples Building on Your Strengths,"This book merely provides desriptions of what is good or bad in a relationship. Most couples already know and could recite the same things in their relationship. In fact they did in all the statistics mentioned in the book.I found this book useless to help couples actually deal with the issues. The book preaches what is happy and unhappy.There is no real practical exercises in the book that were interesting enough to try. If a couple is having a ""unhappy relationship"" how in the world do you think they are going to sit down and read the book or take the ridictulas mini quizes.This is the biggest was of $22.00 I have ever spent on a self help book."
4,Interesting,Book is a lot about the dad's point of view and I was hoping for a little more insight into Jeffrey's childhood. Not an easy book to find. The dad certainly falls on his sword here. Not a lot about the mother's role either.
5,An extremely relevant book,"This book no doubt disappointed the tabloid readers who expected prurient revelations of sex and violence. It is a very serious and overwhelmingly sad book about a good man who fathered a monstrous criminal and about his efforts to understand how that came to happen. It is one of the most disturbing and important books I have read about the experience of fatherhood, and the moral and psychological issues that it raises are difficult and vastly important. It is an unsensational and unsentimental but tragically moving book written with modesty and intelligence, and it does not deserve the kind of readership that it got."
2,Pyle Marine Amps,Product is not very durable as a marine amp. Have had to replace many of them. Trying a different brand. Power is low for RMS equivalent.
5,This book was wonderful!,"I read Barbara Wood's novel The Prophetess a few months ago, and I was so excited to learn that she had a new book coming out. This was just as good as The Prophetess, or even better, since the ending left me more satisfied. I love the way the book moves back and forth between two time periods, and the family relations that are not what they seem. Also, I learned a lot about Chinese culture and herbal medicine from reading this book."
1,Book on CD,Unless your ready to print 344 pages I would suggest sticking with the manual. Nothing special here. Your better off buying a book on how to use a video camera.
4,What the manual doesn't tell you,"The Ulead manual tells you (most of) the stuff that VS does. It gives you very little idea about HOW to turn a collection of software functions into a good-looking finished video. This book does tell you that. Getting Results will dramatically reduce the time from when you install the software until you are productive with it.And if you live in 'the colonies', .pdf is far cheaper and quicker than half a tree."
5,easily one of the best books I have ever read!,"This is an absolutely fantastic book. I have read hundreds of motivational and self-help books over the years, but as a business owner, I have never read a more incisive and life-transforming book as this one.The author's experiences are so relevant to issues we all face and the practical applications at the end of each chapter adds to the value of this book. It is easy to read and forces you to see your life in an entirely new light.I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever encountered adversity of any kind."
4,kewl book - check it out!!,Amy's new teacher (sub 4 a longer per. of time) is like magorly evil. 4 some reason she's always making Amy look stupid. Amy's never had a teacher hate her espesaily this much. But Why? She has to have a reason to hate her. Amy also needs to find out why Ms. Weller has mysteriously dissapered.this is a suprizin book and is a good read. = )
4,I became obsessed with turning the pages.,"Wow. That pretty much sums my reaction to this book. I finished the book in about 3 days. The hate he describes oozes from the pages into your mind so you can vividly visualize it. The love he portrays will move you into reading it even more. Several twists to say the least, which I knew going in based on other novels I've read of his. But I still couldn't get them all.Easily worth the cash."
4,I can't stop reading Ted Dekker's work...'Obsessed' is fantastic!,"I picked up 'Red' at my public library several weeks ago on impulse and I have been blazing through Ted Dekker's novels ever since! I finished 'Obsessed' this morning and I have to say I enjoyed this novel tremendously! Stephen is a wonderful character because he seems to be based in reality, not modeled like a superhero. An average man who finds himself in an extra-ordinary situation, battling for his life and the life of the woman he loves to obsession but has never met. At times one might think some of Stephen's actions unrealistic but as you read on, you realize that he basically behaves the way most humans would; out of instinct and yes, sometimes quite outrageously.Thank you Ted Dekker for the novels you have written so far, including 'Obsessed'. I am looking forward to many more in the years to come."
5,Dekker did it again!,Obsessed is another hit by author Ted Dekker. I have read all of his work and this one rates as one of my favorites. The way he ties the past with the present through a search for truth is amazing. I can't wait until his next novel.
2,Weak ending is a letdown,"It's been a while since I read this, but my most vivid memory of the story is the weak ending. Dekker makes his villain seem like the ultimate evil this side of Satan, but then dispatches him with a yawn.I did think that the scenes in the concentration camp were tense and riveting, but the 70's part of the story struck me as odd. The protagonist's attempts to retrieve the objects of his obsession were so nutty that they played like black comedy. Dressing up like a woman to sneak into a building? What is this, ""Mrs. Doubtfire""?As with much recent ""Christian"" fiction, there's not much here in the way of insight or edification. ""Love conquers all"" is just about the only spiritual message here. Bottom line, ""Obsessed"" isn't horrible, but there are better books out there."
3,Decent storyline - but lacking spiritual substance,"Obsessed was clever in the repetitive flashbacks to Nazi Germany and the prison camps, and it painted a very grim picture of what it might have been like to be a ""guest"" there. I was interested enough to get through to the end of the book. A great thing about the book was the attitude one can have to allow them be at peace with dying, but the author didn't really substantiate this attitude except to declare that it was because they had found love and hope -in eachother? This isn't enough to overcome the despair of death.I was also disappointed by the repetitive scenes where the main characters are caught by the bad guys and escape.My opinion of Dekker books is declining. I think I'll give him one more chance. Perhaps I'll try Thr3e. That seems to be one his more popular stories."
4,Good story,"I have not even finished it yet, about 70 pages (paperback) to go.I dont know where I found this book, did not know the author or the publisher were concidered ""Christian"". I have read 100's of 1,000,s of books in my life, mostly King, Koontz, Fiest, Grisham, Brust, and several other more obscure authors.I found this book very exciting and fun. Sure, the characters dont do things that you would think they would do. The plot has some holes. At times it seems as though you are reading and amature work ( like my review). But never the less, this has so far been an exciting and fun read. 70 more pages.I am not finishing it now becouse I have had a drink or two.I just wanted to stick up for the book and the author."
4,I get it......,"This was my 2nd Ted Dekker book. I read Thr3e first and immediately wanted to read more by Dekker. So I bought this, the Circle Trilogy and Blink and read this one first. The book was good, but it wasn't great. I felt like Dekker was pounding the reader over the head with his message (which I won't spoil for those of you who haven't read it). By the time you get to the end of the book, you've heard the message so many times in so many different ways that you just want to be done with hearing about it. It was a great message, but I think it was overdone. So would I recommend the book?? Yeah, but I would recommend reading this one first so you're not let down by his other works."
3,Not Ted's best...,I had read Thr3e before reading this novel. I thought Obsessed was going to be awesome with a treasure hunt element.I was wrong. It's entertaining but it falls short on too many areas. It starts off great. It's when the beginning fades away that it doesn't seem to feel right. Things are too tedious with Stephen trying to break into the apartment. It was fun at first but it gets old.The characters I like and the sub plot during WW2 was interesting. The ending didn't work for me. If you like Dekker than its fun but it is flawed.
3,What to say....,This book is about a man's hatred that destoys his own son and causes others to suffer as well. It delves into the mind of someone totally obsessed with hatred. I used it as a discussion topic for why we should NEVER be tempted to hate because it will only destroy us!I like what Ted Dekker is trying to do which is make us think but his preference for the graphic almost over the edge writing goes to the extreme. Maybe some people need that but I don't think ALL of us qualify for that catagory which in turn keeps us from reading some of his writings. People from the streets aren't the ones reading his books.
3,Not one of his best books,"I'm a Ted Dekker fan. I found Blink, Blessed Child, and the Circle Trilogy to be really well written and interesting novels.Thr3e was a page turner, but a mediocre story. This book was neither well written nor a page turner. I kept waiting for something to happen and then the book ended. There was no payoff, and the story line was full of things which held promise but never materialized.Dekker has the ability to be insightful and provocative and to make me think. This book did none of those things."
2,"Ted, not your best","It was fair, but after the totally implausible actions (fiction should make sense within the bounds of the fictional ""world"" given in the novel)I find the book wore out its welcome with me. .Characters developed as ""main"" yet have significant things happen that are brushed aside with only a slight comment...People who show up out of nowhere with unreal ""talents"" that help move the plot along--and then fade into nothingness...bad guys that help move the plot along---for money--and then don't even fade...they simply disappear---and the final ending---the ""you've got to be kidding"" scenario....Well, as much as I like Dekker (one of the few Christian authors next to Peretti that can actually write intelligently)I'll have to pass on this one with only a ""fair""....but hey...the idea of the plot was very very good..."
2,Not impressed,"I don't get what the other readers liked about this manufactured thriller. Yes, there were some suspenseful scenes (too few) and a couple times when the characters poked at my emotions (some situations truly are heart-wrenching), but overall the plot was unbelievable, the writing OK but not great, and the characters were not very deeply developed, so I didn't care about them very much. Also, they seemed to think and act inconsistently. I sensed were the story was going, ""twists"" and all, and without fail, there it went. It was very formulaic. Mr. Dekker does try hard, and maybe that's the problem. I got the feeling he was trying TOO hard to make me care. Truly great writers have a knack for pulling the reader in without showing the tricks they use to do it. The cards up Mr. Dekker's sleeves are too apparent."
5,Brilliant and Breathtaking,"Don't start if you don't have time to finish. Aptly named, Obsessed will grab your imagination and not let go. Psychological thrillers are rarely my cup of tea, so I resisted this one for a long time. It is brilliant, breathtaking, and paced at a sprint from start to finish. It is hard to put a finger on any one strength. If there are weaknesses, the principal ones may be that the pacing never lets up - and the ending is almost too perfect (for this reviewer's taste) - yet I was consumed (obsessed?) by the need to reach that ending. The adrenaline pumping pace held competition with the desire to take in every word - the urgency to skim and so keep up with the narrative held competition with the brilliant writing that held too many gems to rush past.As a writer myself I am always searching for that elusive quality that raises one work above the crowd. Ted Dekker has captured that quality in Obsessed."
4,Obsessed,An interesting and fast read. The historical based fiction is well written. Dekker pulls the reader in quickly and holds the attention until the last page.
4,"Excellent book, but not Dekkers best","I just finished reading Obsessed and let me begin by saying it was excellent. I love the cross overs between past and present until they combine perfectly into the same time, ending the novel in a way you never expected. I also love how Dekker has once again so beautifully touched on some major Christian themes while keep the story real and exciting enough to not beat people over the head with religion. An excellent read. However, having just finished Three and the Circle Trilogy, i do have to say that Obsessed isn't quite as captivating as its predecessors. Still, if this is one of Dekker's slower novels, I will be reading him for years to come."
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS,"If you have never read a Ted Dekker Book - start with this one.The whole story flows well and does not taiper off at the end. Dekker deals with the concept of ""If we were obsessed with God as much as we are ourselves, what a change this would make to the world"".This is a book that even made me laugh at a few points at how the main character conducted himself in certain situations.In my opinion - his best work to date.GS."
4,If You Like Out-of-the Box,Ted Dekker does it again. I so appreciate a writer that isn't cookie cutter predictable. You can count on Ted to bring you Christian truth... but it's not all wrapped up in a pretty package. He has depth and an amazing imagination!
5,AreYou?,"Imagine being transport back to 1970, and your name is Stephan. You believed you had a ordinary life until the unspeakable happens: your adoptive. You mother was rich, but also a mother during the era of nazi Germany. Upon her death she leaves you clues that unsolves more than relics, but something or someone more value. How far would you go to get that prize? Would you go far enough to die?Roth and his father want the same treasures, the same power, but want more than stephan wants: greed and the unthinkable. Dekker takes it one step above Three and the Circle Triology. An interesting novel, unlike any other he has written."
1,What Am I Missing Here?,"Who wrote all the five star reviews? Obviously the Dekker fan club. This book is a piece of garbage. The characters are cardboard one dimensional figures and the plot is laughable. I found some really good laughs a number of times, particularly the places where the hero is in a tight spot and the action totally stops while he embarkes on elaborate soliloquies and rhapsodic day dreams, or a character at risk of being murdered is totally forgotten by the hero for a several chapters. I realize that this is supposed to be a mindless toss away read, but even in this category this book fails miserably."
5,Harkening by Carolyn Howard-Johnson,"It is a heart warming, charming, at times sad and at times funny collection of stories. Ms. Howard-Johnson is a wonderful story teller."
5,A Picture Perfect Life,This book was very good. The fact that the pictures really showed his entire life was refreshing. You felt like you were there throughout his life and were experiencing the events of his life with him. After reading the book I wish I would have had the opportunity to meet Jimmy Stewart. This book was a tribute to his life.
5,"Highly recommended for family, preschool, kindergarten, and community library","An award-winning independent children's recording artist, Brady Rhymer has released his fourth and best children's CD to date with Every Day Is A Birthday. Original, ""kid friendly"" lyrics are backed up by Rhymer's energetic guitar playing and precision backup singers are flawlessly recorded. The numbers comprising this outstanding and highly recommended for family, preschool, kindergarten, and community library children's CD music collection include: Rock 'n' Roll Mother Goose; Dilly Dally Daisy; Keeping Up With You; Instead Of Watching My TV; Every Day Is A Birthday; Full Moon Walk; Little Sacka Sugar; Look In Your Pocket; Mama Hug; Diggin' Up A Dinosaur; Mama Don't Allow; Side By Side: Happy Birthday Around The World; Snippets; and Karaoke Versions."
4,Enjoyable DVD,"I purchased this DVD not knowing exactly what to expect, and was happily surprised. The main feature is filled with information - and the other special features on the DVD like ""Fish School"" and ""Relax with Fish and Other Animals"" make it a pretty good package.I would recommend it to children between 6 and 12 who enjoyed ""Finding Nemo""- I think some adults will find it entertaining as well."
4,Cichlids and all other fishes of lake malawi,"This book is excellent for someone who is more interested in identifying lake malawi fish as opposed to general information on how to properly keep these fish in a home aquarium. For someone who is not a beginner, this definitely is a must have book. The pictures are great and there is a whole lot of information on lake malawi and the general characteristics of each fish. Buy this book, it will be a decision you will not regret."
1,Not worth the money,This is one of the most poorly produced books I have ever encountered. At least 25 text pages have been left in German--what was the publisher thinking?--and the design is atrocious. It will be a cold day in Hades before I buy another TFH Publications book.
4,A Sensitive Frightening Performance,"David Janssen's show business associates must have been trying to tell him something when he was persuaded to take on this role of a brilliant but self destructive professional man in this hard hitting made-for TV film. As the camera close-shots his bloated, alcohol ravaged features and watery eyes, you get the feeling it wasn't all acting. Tragicaly, he died just a couple of years after this was made. Tough to watch, but with a strong message for every one who has wrestled with the Demons."
2,NOT a Nerf Turbo,"For anyone in search of a Nerf Turbo replica, this is not it. I bought this due to the favorable reviews but I actually own an original Nerf Turbo and the Poof is definitely a lower grade knock off. The original turbo is quite a bit heavier than this ball and throws a much better spiral. To get this Poof to throw a tight spiral you have to use your wrist instead of your arm. It also ""quacks"" if you try and throw it long distances. It is a decent attempt at replicating the classic Nerf Turbo but ultimately falls short in several areas."
3,Footballs,"This was a decent purchase. Good price and shipped quickly. I graded them average because I did not receive the balls in the colors that I had asked for. I asked for twelve red balls because of they were being used for a company event. I received all different colors rather than what I ordered. If you ask me, they just sent what they had in stock."
3,awesome balls,"the only bummer for me with this product is that i needed all the same color, but i ended up with five colors and there was no way to just order ten of the same color. the balls are fun though."
2,Not the quality I expected,I tried to save a few dollars and purchased this one instead of the one made by Pampered Chef. The lid is not a perfect fit. The meat dries out too fast.
2,Steep Learning curve. Not as easy as they make it out to be.,Keep in mind this is not your typical roaster. It takes a lot of time and practice to learn how to use it right. Be very careful with it while you're learning so not to crack it and give yourself about double cooking time to be sure things cook all the way. Yes it can give great results but its a pain to learn...not sure its worth it.
1,3 cracks after 5 or 6 uses,"I followed the directions soaking 15 to 20 mins. prior to use, after 5 or 6 times I had 3 cracks in the bottom. I contacted the seller unbeatablesales who said I should contact the manufacturer for warranty. It seems to me the seller has more influence with the manufacture than I would have. Bottom line is I'm out of luck!Fortunately I also bought a Romertopf #117 works great and no cracks, I recommend them highly, I have several of theirs I have used them for years without any problems.I'm very unhappy with the way unbeatable sales handled this problem. The pot was only 6 mos. oldAl B."
5,Wow nice roaster,"This is a nice roaster for anything large and will fit a turkey, This is a gift so I can't wait to see the person face when they open itThank you"
4,No more nesting?,"I have a Romertopf from 1986 and a Schlemmertopf from the 1970s. We recently cracked the 30-40 year old Schlemmertopf. I just got my new replacement, and it doesn't nest! :(The older versions nest perfectly - top into the bottom - which makes storage easy. I'm really bummed that this new one doesn't nest. I KNOW it will cook well, though."
4,OK,"OK decanter, bought it for my girlfriends parents, they loved it. I did open the package after it arrived to make sure everything was fine. It has a small engravement on the side from the manufacturer that looks fine. It also had, to my surprise, a MADE IN ROMANIA sticker. I think thats the first time I see something made in romania lol. Well it fits half a bittle and for the price you can't go wrong. Didn't look like the cheapest glass that would break easy."
3,Just okay,"I was eager to get this decanter based on the great reviews. However, the quality of the glass is just okay. Perhaps not surprising based on the low price. Mine has a very obvious bubble near the top of the neck. Also, the glass is VERY thick and this creates suboptimal pouring tendencies. There is some dripping. As another reviewer noted, it is difficult to get all the wine out. Even pouring when the decanter is half full is challenging, involving inverting the decanter nearly upside down."
1,Poor packaging; arrived shattered,"I wish I could have reviewed this item, but when my wife picked up the box, all she heard was broken glass (and a lot of it). Upon opening the outer box, it was obvious that the person that packed it had no clue how to protect anything. We didn't even open the inner box; just returned it to Amazon, which fortunately didn't cost us anything. I'm getting real leery of ordering direct from Amazon!"
3,Crystal? Really?,"This serves it's purpose and looks really cool, but it tastes, feels, smells, and sounds like acrylic. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck..."
4,Nice addition,"I bought this as a gift for a family member but have had the opportunity to use it at their home. Normally I am a big fan of leaving the wine in the bottle. However, this is great, especially for an older red. It also displays the color of the wine.The raised portion of the bottom helps to aerate the wine.It is easy to pour and pretty stable, a good feature as the evening progresses."
3,One Little problem,"Ok here is the problem with this one. First off all it's very good if you will decant a wine lets say in a afternoon to drink it in the evening, because the neck is very narrow it gives enough air through long period of time, but not to much to get it spoiled. But if you decant a wine lets say 30min or an hour like most people will do before the dinner, get something that has a wide opening/neck. But overall it's a good decanter, and it's easy to pour out of it."
5,"Perfect femininity, classic look and feel","I bought this watch as a matching set for my wife and I after searching for something like it for more than a year. For this price range, this watch is terrific. Elegant, stylish... just beautiful.Craftsmanship is very good. Not that my wife cares, but it bothers me when the second hand doesn't align with the minute index markers, but this watch does. It also keeps time very well. The band is solid, and the overall weight is perfect.My wife loves this watch and wears it every day. It looks very pretty and wears well with everything. The mens watch, although should be in a different review, is equally as nice, although it doesn't go as well with casual clothing. It's very dressy.In summary, this ladies watch is perfectly feminine and beautiful. LOVE it."
1,Fluker's Cricket Quencher is a Fluke!,I had high hopes for this product. Giving the crickets something to drink without the drowning aspect is good in theory. Unfortunately my crickets avoided this stuff like the plague. It would just sit in the cage slowly shrinking as the moisture evaporated and it would become a little hard stone that I would just have to throw away. Waste of money.
5,Smart buy!,I purchased this item for the up coming summer. I used it once and found it very easy to set up and to take down. The bag is of good quality and the wheels make it easy to move. I can't find anything wrong with this item and would recommend this if you're looking for a good canopy. The price was right along with the free shipping....Thanks...
1,Terrible product!!!!,I am extremely disappointed in this canopy. I used it 3 times and the last time a storm blew in and bent the poles so it is now unusable. The company will not be held responsible for the shoddy materials and I now have a canopy that is 2 feet tall due to the bent poles!!! A horrible waste of money.
5,Works perfect in Mexico,"I test this unlocked smartphone with GSM network under Telcel in Mexico and Works without any problem, just make sure you configure it property, since default setting wont work.The good: WM5 has a lot of app available for the phone, and Java performance is acceptable for 2D gaming and apps, pretty easy to use, no need for read a manual.The bad: Battery life is not good, but it comes with dual battery so, its ok and JAVA3D wont work.Notice: If you want to install unsigned apps, like SNES or NES emus, you must setup the phone to accept unsigned (unsigned = not from official provider) apps."
1,MISLEADING DESCRIPTION,Although the description on the web says TRI-BAND Amazon shipped to me DUAL BAND phones AND THEY REFUSE TO EXCHANGE THEM.DONT BUY IT UNLESS YOU LIVE IN EUROPE. I GOT STUCK WITH 11 PHONES that DO NOT WORK IN THE US. They event shipped it with the european plug.THIS PHONES ARE FOR EUROPE ONLY even though the webpages says they are triband.
2,greatly dissapointed,All the reviews gave this item good marks. I'm unable to see that well in the dark with mine. I was reaqlly dissapointed in this unit. Don't recommend it.
1,eyesight works better.,"Was mine a defective unit ?put fresh battery in .. read instructions, do use binoculars on a regular basis I know how to set eye piece. This unit had green screen . thats a period .Worked when IR was on. Which leaves a RED BEACON for anyone to see You.Used with cresent moon and starlight. green screen..without IR.I called Company bought through Amazon and will be returning this unit.Seems there will be no problem returning unit, though cost of return shipping.But I don't have a night vision device which I was looking forward to using.So back to reading alot of reviews again, or maybe ill just eat alot of carrotshope my eyesight improves..."
3,Almost worked!!,"It will help at night, but just it. A little help. Very little for medium distances. In tight places works fine. (Who needs this for tight spaces??? Not me!!)"
3,Decent 1G NV Scope,"It works well, durable, easy to use first generation scope. It's funny to see some of the bad reviews on this scope--blurred edges and slightly blurry vision. This is normal an inherent on all first generation night vision devices. The blurred or bubbled edges are geometric distortion inherent in the design of all 1G NV devices.If you want a miracle product, spend the $3-$5k on better goggles. For $200, this is a great deal and does what it advertises. Not the best 1G device, but definitely not the worst."
2,Bad cover design,"The lens cover is badly design. I lose it when it fell off accidentally.There should be a string to tight it to the body, like a camera.Without the cover, the sensor can be damaged by sunlight."
2,So so,has intermittent problems poor optical quality with burn rings visible at night. . . . . . . . .
4,Great product for long range viewing.,"Great product, feels very durable. Excellent long range night vision viewing. Not good for short range. The only trouble I had was you are constantly focusing the lens depending on distance, which can be a real pain when you are in a hurry to see something."
2,Yukon NVMT 4x50,"Item arrived looking good - for a birthday several days later. This allowed me to get a battery for it before the Bday.On Bday, it functionned pretty well - especially for first generation, but it did not want to ""cut off"". Tried holding the off button, lightly touching, double pressing, etc. Finally went off. By next day would not turn off at all - had to remove the battery - a little difficult because I think it is supposed to be water proof or resistant. Now comes on whenever battery is installed. I am wary of items that start out defective and have (with a fair amount of difficulty I might add) returned it."
5,A born storyteller,"I wouldn't be surprised if Deborah Grabien's characters walked off the page and into my living room, that's how absorbing her writing is. Right from the start you're swept up in her characters' lives; you root for them to solve the mystery and are sorry to see them go at the end of the story.When I was a kid growing up I always wanted to go on a camping trip with Louis L'Amour just so I could listen to him tell tales around the campfire. With Grabien I'd want a scrumptious meal and fine wine; she's the kind of writer you want to settle in to enjoy.This is the second book in a series of mystery novels. You don't need to read them in order, but you are going to want to read them both so you might as well buy ""The Weaver and the Factory Maid"" too while you're at it!"
2,Good book except for 1 flaw.,"My mom got me this book a few days ago. I'veonly done 10 out of the 21 puzzles, but I feelthat it challenges me well, and it is a good book.There is one problem though. Puzzle #7 doesn'twork out. I even looked at the answer, and it stilldoesn't work. They're trying to say that 33x38=912,when it actually equalls 1254. My mom and I areboth quite upset about this, but the quality of theother problems nearly makes up for this flaw."
3,"Good information for any woman, but mainly the dependant one","I picked this book up because of it's catchy title and to find out where I fit in. I found a few helpful hints but this book will really help those women who really do believe they need to be taken care of and do not know how to break away. At the end of the book, I found the list of items to do with developing a stronger character helpful. Definately a book to share with women I know."
3,History bOOk.,"This is a somewhat basic book. Not bad by any imagination, but ""tell me something I don't know"" comes to mind."
5,Fast shipping and remarkable product,The product was in excellent condition. I received it faster than I thought. This was my first time buying anything on amzaon and the experience was great.
3,For the price it's okay,"I have many night vision devices, some REALLY good ones, and some cheap ones to throw around in the truck and keep handy without the great fear of it being stolen. Clarity is just what you'd expect from a GEN 1 device; actually, their bino's are much better and I have two pair of them."
4,got it as a gift,"i like it so far ,never had NV so i cant compare it to other all i know is gen 2/3 is bokuu $$one thing i dont like is you cant mount it on rifle so , im trying to make a adapter to fit on my rifle which i would prefer or ill try to use the head gear then look in the scope ..got lots varmits out at night , caught a beaver eating the cat food outside last night lol"
3,Not specific enough for my need,"I needed this for a test and it was too general. It would recommend it too a lay person or patient tech, but not an RN."
5,Outstanding Soccer Training,"When I needed something to help my two young soccer players improve their skills out on the field, I discovered Play Like Preki. He's terrific and my children were captivated by his enthusiasm and ability to demonstrate all the fundamentals they were having difficulty with...Preki takes them through skills, drills and then they run outside to practice. This is a great DVD."
3,Solid action,"Outstripped by the discoveries of no wmd in Irag, this is still a good action tale. Skimming is enough."
4,Brothers in Arms Novel,"Good Book. A little weak in some action on the ""Killers from Holland"". I'd like to see more of them in the future. But, overall I enjoyed the book and would buy the next one without hesitation."
5,Moeller's work is excellent,"This is a GREAT story. Deep characterization of Wonder Woman, with everything flowing out of that characterization. This story could not have been told with any other superhero.Add to that the awesome artwork and you've got a high-quality tale that you'll be showing your non-comics friends to get them to consider buying comics. Yep, it's THAT good."
4,Wonder Woman's show,"Great book. A different aproach to the justice league. Outstanding art (there's a pin-up of Wonder Woman that should be made a poster). It falls a bit short on the story...I kind of was expecting more, but it's a good read."
5,"classic ""Nerf"" type revisited","Since it's now the dead of winter (20 below this morning), this hasn't gotten a whole lot of use yet and I can't speak to its durability. However, I can say it has the same appearance and feel of the original Nerf that I had when I was a kid. It has a nice plain-Jane design whith no funky shapes, textures, appendages, or logos, just like the ones Nerf doesn't make anymore! Throws real nice, doesn't hurt when it hits you in the head, and my kid loves it."
3,"Nice product, but falls apart after short use!","Product is nice. I just wish that it would last longer. The ball was bought 3 weeks ago, and its already falling apart."
1,Not as good as a Nerf,I would not get this 'nerf' like football again. It's not weighted like a nerf and thus doesn't throw well. Both I and the kids find it difficult to throw as well as our old nerf and even catching it is not so wonderful. Bottom line-get a nerf
5,Good bvook,"this is a good book to refer to when you want to find whats in season, it also gives a calorie count and how to store your fruit and veggies, which a lot of us may not know."
3,Not very compelling or memorable,"Not terribly memorable, though competent, story of a group of British teenage boys who compete to get admitted to the university system in the early 1980s.I just didn't care very much about anyone or anything in it. I agree with the review by Zach. There is little or nothing to grab onto and remember about these guys or their story. You'd think there would be, especially with a troubled teacher involved, but it never comes together."
2,"History Boys, Teens, and Gays","This movie is beautifully shot, very low key, and fairly entertaining. However, one of the implications in the film is that the homosexual groping of teenage boys is forgivable when done by a quirky ""intellectual"", and that boys are willing able and to tolerate it. Also,the ""bad guy"" is the head of the school who fired him for his bad behavior. If you can overlook those themes in a movie you may enjoy it, otherwise pass on it."
4,enjoyable,"Nice movie. A little slow, but acceptably so. One of those movies that doesn't necessarily have a big climax but just makes you feel lucky to have been allowed to see a brief time in the characters' lives. Interesting debates about why one learns and the difference and value of knowledge vs. truth. The whole cast was excellent."
4,Teachers and Student Unite,"Well written, well structured, well directed and well acted. Did you apply to go to the Ivy League? Do you know your SAT scores? Do you value education? Please watch this movie at least once."
2,"Rubbish (Well, it is an English movie!)","This movie was totally, mind-numbingly, boring! The movie was a study in character (and motives), and the relationship between teacher and student. I get that. Please don't high hand me with your intellectual reprovals. The movie was littered with references to high brow literature and poetry to the point that it came off sounding like an intellectual version of name dropping. I don't think the comparison to Dead Poets Society is accurate. Dead Poets Society was a much better film, in my opinion.Anyway you slice it, though, the movie was long, laborious, and boring. I won't even go into the weird sexual overtones."
2,"Ultimately, merely, nought but an activist agenda flick...","Well done, and interesting as in the way of ""Dead Poet's Society"", yet ultimately nothing more than a gay-rights activist agenda movie.'nuff said."
1,Awful.,"Spending anymore time on this film than I already have is a waste. Skip out on this film. It is awful, dreadful, and gross."
2,Boring,"Saying that something is good or bad it is really a matter of taste, and for my taste this movie is slow and boring."
4,very good film,"I enjoyed the film, very much. I always wanted to viewthis film. Since I saw previews of it. When it first came out.I also was satisfied with the speed of delivery which I got.The day I received my email confirmation of my order.The DVD arievedThank you.Alex"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:It's nice to see a movie about school that isn't formulaic, but something about The History Boys just doesn't work; maybe it's the fact that it works better on stage, or maybe it's the lack of any real plotline, but I found the movie interesting yet distinctly unmemorable."
1,Not Well Written,"This book was definately not worth it. 200 pages of code with not a very good expaination behind it. The author tells you the ""how"" and not the ""why"". If you want to learn to program with MFC and know how and why your program works, then stay away from this book. If you want the code without needing the how or why, then this book is for you. This book is more of a reference than a learning tool.If typos and misspelling bother you too, then stay away from essential visual C++."
1,Poor customer service,This company has poor customer service. I needed to return an item and they would not call me back. I would not buy anything from this company ever again.
4,WeatehrTech stone/bug deflector,I have a 2007 toyota camry. Fit and finish is excellent. Rating this 4 stars and not 5 for teh fact the instructions fail to mention the hood snubbers that determine how far the hood sits in teh latch need to be adjusted to a shorter heigth. The grill / hood gap is exceptionally tight on a camry of this body style and adjustemnets are required. The item installed in under 30 minutes. Make sthe front of the car look nice. I'd but one from teh manufacturer again.
1,I expected coleman quality & was dissapointed,This tablecloth bleeds. As soon as it got wet we all ended up with red checked arms! I ordered a dozen from oriental trader for the same price and they are perfect! Go figure!Avoid these!
2,difficult to remove memory stick.,The reader works well and is great if you are going to use it as an extra flash drive and leave the memory stick in it. If you are wanting to use it to download different memory sticks to computer it is not the one you want. Changing the memory stick is difficult it doesn't open easily and it is hard to get the stick out of it.
4,It works,"As memory cards get smaller and smaller, peripherals that still use the MemoryStick or MemoryStick Pro is phasing out...so this is a great idea is still having the capability in using the MemoryStick, but as a flash drive. This works very well, I haven't had problems with it yet."
1,will ruin your card!,"ive had this for a few months now. yes, it does its job for a little while, but it's extremely cheap plastic and will ruin your card! like the other reviews say, its difficult to get the card in, and when you push it in, the metal contacts in the reader scratch the contacts on your card, so eventually it becomes so scratched that the card doesn't work anymore!!!! dont waste your money on this unless you want to lose your info and keep having to buy cards. what a piece of crap!"
1,COMPLETELY OVERRATED,"I sincerely wish I could have given this piece of crap movie ZERO stars BUT I had to settle on an undeserving one star rating. You see very little cannibalism in this movie. It has poor attempts to create shock factor by killing animals cruely. This movie had a ton of dialouge and very little GORE. Yes, very little gore. You freaks who think that this movie is gory need to get a life. It's just STUPID. I found this to be filled with absurdity, rape, and fake animal endtrails portrayed as human remains, WOW, NOT! Thankfully I only paid 8.00 for this pile of junk. I'd have been TICKED if I paid Amazon's price of 20.00. Anyway, if you like tribal nudity (PUKE), rape scenes which make NO SENSE, and senseless animal cruelty go for it. Other than that, get a REAL movie, this one sucks a**."
1,"You can paint a turd gold, but it's still a turd.","BE WARNED: this film's reputation far outshines its content! Don't let the hype and controversy lure you in. It suckered me...and now, in my mind's ear, P.T. Barnum is laughing."
2,Yawn,"Sure, this movie has an initial impact upon first viewing it, but after that I find myself being bored out of my wits watching it. Granted it's gory and all, it feels like it drags on forever. I find nothing remotely shocking about the animal killing scenes, nor the deaths at the end. Ok, so it looks real-- so what? Anyone who claims they can't watch it more than once a month are just plain wimps. I can't watch it more than once a year because it's so boring. It won't send shivers up your spine, it won't make you vomit, it won't make you turn away from the screen -- the only thing it might make you do is turn it off from sheer lack of excitement and/or interesting plot."
1,A young female vegan's nightmare!,"OMG, they, like, killed and animal and ATE it! Couldn't they, like, pay someone to do it for them? Seriously though, this is an all around waste of time, lame plot, awful acting and unattractive characters, both physically and emotionally. All schlock and no shock. If you read a couple other reviews you can pretty much imagine the few violent scenes, probably more graphically than they are actually portrayed and save yourself some money. Maybe this would qualify as horror in vegitarian circles but as for the rest of us meat eaters it may just make you want to fire up the grill."
5,Where to Begin...,"Cannibal Holocaust makes Saw look like a Barney film... ha ha, basically this movie can't be compared to others in it's class, if there even is a class, it's gory, violent, and apparently they kill real animals on set, it can be pretty gruesome, and if you doubt you have the stomach for these kinds of films i wouldn't recommend watching it. I gave this movie 5 stars. i truly believe it to be a real piece of art, some may disagree, but when you think about the plot, the way the film was shot, and some scenes which look incredibly realistic, you get the feeling that a lot of time and effort was put behind it. If your a horror genre freak like myself I highly recommend purchasing this movie, watch it once, watch it twice, and you may never watch it again, but the fact that it's in your arsenal and many people have never seen it says a lot. Good luck, and oh yea, watch it with the lights OFF!"
1,cannibal holocaust sucks,"all i can say about this movie is it sucks.....i rather watch Exorcist II:The Heretic that was a lot better,than this p.o.s nothing i do in life will make me watch this crap again i rather watch Regan Mcneil puking on father karras,and do the spider walk."
5,Unique in style and gross factor...,"...well this was one interesting film. After having heard much about it I finally ordered it and watched it just a few moments ago. I will admit that for its time, this film was way ahead. I can see why people thought it was real, and the movie was banned in many contries. This is one of a kind, the way it was shot, I think it is cinematic originality. Yes it's gross, yes it's violent, yes it will stay in your mind for a long time. The effects are so real, unlike any other movie I've seen, CG has nothing on this. If you want to watch a truly spectacular and original piece of film, give this one a go, but be warned, it is not for the weak."
1,Abhorrent,"The film had its merits, but I honestly, in good conscience, cannot get past the animal cruelty scenes. The turtle part, I was lucky enough to fast-forward. I didn't have time to fast-forward through the little piglet being shot and it made me sick then and STILL makes me sick. It's about terrible people having terrible things happen to them. I will give credit where credit is due: This is probably the first ""Found footage"" films, which happens to be a genre I love. I still wish I hadn't seen this. If you do get a chance to watch it, I would suggest going for the ""Animal Cruelty-free"" version. I wish I had."
3,will,"kind of disappointed after watching ""the most disturbing movie ever made"" the last 15 minutes was the only thing that got a reaction out of the crowd watching it. Way over hyped"
1,Disgusting.,I couldn't finish this movie when my roommate watched it. There is a scene where a girl is raped with sharpened rocks. I don't know how anyone can honestly enjoy this movie.
2,Cannibal Holocaust,"Though it tried, this was no CANNIBAL FEROX (MAKE THEM DIE SLOWLY). Most of the film dragged on and only the FF button kept me awake. Some scenes were good, plenty of nudity and violence, if that's what you are after, but the rape scene in the mud was almost comical. See FEROX and leave this one on the shelf."
2,Scariest movie please...,"I bought this movie because of all the reviews that it had for being scary and disturbing. it was not. yes there are some gross parts but in the hole this movie was disapointing. the plot was stupid and the music was lame, i guess it might have been cool in the 70's but its not now. i wil give it being one of the grossest things i have seen but it wasnt scary. i will be selling this one back on here soon. i guess the best part of this movie is its sell back value..."
2,Not Really That Good,"After watching a ""Top Five Most Disturbing Films Countdown,"" I thought I'd finally give this film a chance, after years of consideration. Well, it was a let down. Yeah, I'll grant that it has a certain off-putting quality and it isn't exactly light viewing. But still, it is basically a very low budget, amateurish gore-fest, with little redeeming quality. The closing scenes are pretty vivid and the impaled girl is fairly horrendous. But, in the end, Cannibal Holocaust is pretty weak. The final detractor is the fact that several animals were actually killed during its filming. So not only was it amateurish, it was unnecessarily barbaric. In the end, there are many more legitimate films which are far more scary, disturbing and creative. Take a pass on this BS and try: Irreversible, Antichrist, Jacob's Ladder, Requiem For a Dream, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973) or many many others."
4,Snuff or Bluff?,"Cannibal Holocaust is one of the most convincing ""snuff"" films ever, although its not really a snuff film. Some of the special effects scenes in this are scenes that other s.e artists to this day try to recreate but to no success. The effects were so convincing that it was band in many countries! The most amazing aspect of the movie consists of the cast, a real life cannibal tribe! Its completely amazing how the director was able to have these tribesmen act accordingly. This is a underground classic for the hardcore horror fan!"
1,Beyond Reprehensible,"I suppose that I should thank the makers of ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" because the experience of seeing it enabled me, as a longtime over-the-top gore fan, to discover what my limit is. The limit is this: While the human deaths in the film are (clearly) fake, the gruesome killings of various animals are absolutely, unequivocally real. Were these animals killed for the sake of food, to control overpopulation, or for some other potentially legitimate reason? No. THEY WERE KILLED ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF FILMING THE KILLINGS. In terms of humans, snuff films are basically nothing more than urban legends; in terms of animals, however, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is an actual snuff film. Whatever plusses the movie might have (and, believe it or not, they are many), its existence as an animal snuff film is beyond reprehensible."
1,It made me sick,"I feel like a terrible person for even watching this. When I saw the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie I thought ""Oh haha...it can't be all that bad."" Now I think I'm psychologically scarred for life. I'm left wondering if people actually were killed in the making of this film. I can handle fake human murders...but the animal cruelty...real animal cruelty...that's just disgusting. I can't believe this movie was made. And I can't believe it's allowed to be sold in stores. Free speech, yes. But not at the expense of innocent animals. That poor turtle...The guy at the end said the film he watched should be burned. I feel like burning the DVD I just watched except it was a rental.I don't recommend this movie to anybody."
1,"SERIOUSLY, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","This is a movie filled with unnecessary violent rape, animal cruelty, and disgusting gore. Now the gore, for myself, did not bother me, it was the killing of real animals and the scenes of rape. The acting is horrible, and the storyline would have been descent, but because of the graphic nature of this film, it steered away from the story. This was made to be a shock film, nothing more. I was told all horror fans must see this movie, and I really do not know why. It's pure grindhouse trash.If you are into violent rape, the killing of animals for entertainment, and people being eaten, then you would love this movie. If you love horror movies, that doesn't mean you should watch this garbage. I wish I could give it a half a star."
1,I WISHED I'D NEVER BOUGHT IT,"Essentially a rape porn/animal snuff film in which some mad italians use the world's worst horror movie music and some long,labourious and vague storyline about cannibals as a backdrop...f*#king hell I'd rather watch the Simpsons you know what I mean."
1,Not as graphic,Not as graphic as it was made out to be i mean come on where was the gore.There are better movies coming out of hollywood nowadays. Even back in the 80s we had Dawn Of The Dead and The Evil Dead which were much better than this. It was more like watching the national geographic channel but it looked fake.
1,I was duped!!,"Well the quality is better than ""Cannibal Ferox"".....but this one blows too!The animal gore is gross ......but save your $$$.People who think this and ""Cannibal Ferox"" are classics are on crack!!If I can quote Rob Schneider.......'WE SUCK AGAIN'!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"I thought I was missing out on a genre. Garbage. Clearly the producers started the movie and went into the jungle without a script, tried to patch something together at the end. Double coverage camera angles for repeat scenes. Gratuitous violence and sex. Animal cruelty was a joke; anyone upset over those scenes needs to get a life. Watched most of the movie on fast-forward. Not offensive, just garbage."
3,grow up!,"anyone who was morally offended by this movie needs to grow up and join the real world. threatening legal action? patheticno one should be morally offended by a fictional story, no matter how greusome.lastly, stop crying about animal cruelty. if youve ever eaten a hot dog or hamburger, you condone animal cruelty. congrats to the director for having the guts to bring an every day truth to the screen.~gR~"
1,THE ANIMAL KILLINGS ARE REAL,"I cannot even begin to describe how this movie scarred me. I have read other reviews and am glad that I am not the only one who felt sick to my stomach while watching this. I had to turn it off and only wished that I had turned it off sooner. If only there were a way to erase those images from my mind. The only reason anyone even watches ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is to see what all of the fuss is about. That is why I wanted to watch it myself. I just wish I had known that I would be watching cruel tourture of innocent animals. I had to turn away and actually covered my ears so that I couldn't hear the poor animals dying. I only wish the actors torture scenes were real, they deserved it for allowing themselves to be involved in such a vile production. A special place in Hell is reserved for everyone who had a hand in making this piece of trash."
2,Animal Snuff Film,"I thought I had seen this master piece at the drive in theater way back in the early eighties but I had it confused with the other cannibal gym ""Make Them Die Slowly"" (AKA Cannibal Ferox ). I have been hearing for years about how they killed a bunch of animals on film in this movie and must admit this go's way to far to shock the viewer and is really just animal snuff. I have seen enough animals die in real life and have no need to see it on film. The sad thing is the regular effects are not bad for a early 80's cheapo and I for one thought they were pretty creepy. If you are a gore hound you will like this film but all others should stay away."
2,I was expecting great things...but denied.,"Having heard so much about this, I decided to watch it. I even had a bucket ready for puking (hoping this movie could do the impossible). Guess what? I just wasted 90 minutes of my life on this piece of crap. A few scenes were kind of gruesome (for the 80's anyway), but other than that, it was disappointing at best. The animal scenes were real, though, and being a lover of animals my stomach did a small flip at the turtle scene. But as for the human mutilations, there were only 2, the second one obscured heavily by rampaging ""cannibals"". The first mutilation was fair, but as a whole it could have been SO MUCH MORE. And it was SO DAMN SLOW. The 2 mutilations of the group happened at the tail 10 minutes of the film. The beginning scenes of the professor trecking through the forest were a little more entertaining, but just a VERY little more. It was aiming for an 11, I give it a 2."
3,"Not bad film, but some stupid decisions by the filmakers...","One can see cleary through this movie, that was made to shock the audienceof that time (late 70-80's). A movie portraying stupid people is not new, but killing /butchering animals for the love of moviemaking usually points out what kind of crap was behind this film. If you research this movie on the internet you will find out that some of the movie crews were against the animal killings...hey but the head huncho bypassed all concerns and the killings went on.The story and movie itself was interesting and the jungle and outside location shots gave the film a boost. At least these days,if they ever remake this film, cgi and special effects will save the animals...i hope. A film not for the squeemish,, you have cannibalism, rape,torture,and other stuff that horror/gore audience will like."
2,gory? yes. shocking? yes. worth watching? i don't think so...,"I won't make this long, because there are reviews a-plenty for those interested to read.. all with differing and valid opinions.I am a horror fan, and always gravitate to anything that claims to be shocking. Honestly, this movie really disturbed me, and not because of the gore and scenes of cannibalism. I am a jaded person, and can handle blood and guts without so much as a flinch ;) But, animal torture (especially when it's real) and rape will never sit well with me, and these reasons prompt me to never watch this movie again. I suppose that is what makes the movie so shocking...Watch if you must, but know what you are getting yourself into..."
3,pretty cool,"this is a pretty good movie, older of course and VERY graphic, if you have a week stomach do not watch this one thats for sure, but it is worth watching."
3,"It's OK is the best i can say,",i bought this video bc i read about it in Maxim magazine as being wild and twisted. I was expecting more. It was ok only bc it was very different but after watching it i was left feeling unsatisfied. Kinda boring at times but Ok at others. I gave it away after watching and told my friend not to expect much.
3,Not my thing,Not my type of movie. I cant believe the director was harrassed for making this movie. There are other movies that have way more animal cruelty like Apocalypse Now and I dont believe that the director was hounded by anyone.
5,Cannibal Holocaust,Great film in its Grindhouse releasing. Not for everyone but a must for collectors of extreme cinema. Watch at your own risk!!
2,Watch it!!,"And then throw it away, because you will most likley never want to watch it again. I will admit this is one disturbing and sick film and very worthy of its reputation. But should you purchase a movie that you will probably only watch once or twice? Yes. CH has some of the most disgusting and disturbing images you will ever see. If you are looking for cinema that pushes the boundries that is what you get with Cannibal Holocaust. This is by no means a good film, the animal killings (real or not) were redundant, and all the other brutality was over the top. Basically the film is garbage, the only true artists were the composer, and cinematographer. So I recommend you watch Cannibal Holocaust but if you can rent it do so, if not purchase it watch it and place it in your trash where it belongs."
4,Awesome,Last night I finished watching..Cannibal Holocaust what a ride and what a film...It was way better then Men Behind the Sun and Thriller a Cruel Picture...I also finished watching Audition..A very good movie..will keep you on the edge of your seat.....Of all the so called banned movies so far..Cannibal disturbed me...The rape scenes were better than that of Irreversible I thought...Or maybe Monica Belluci is just to fine even if she is getting raped....wasn't really shocked as I was with Cannibal...A good movie to add to your list of other banned nasty movies...Don't bother with Men Behind the Sun.....though it is based on fact....It just is not real enough......
1,live dissection of a turtle is not horror,"The tribe took the shell off and kept returning to pull little bits out of the turtle's innards.This is not horror it is live sadism.We knew the turtle was still alive as its legs were moving. The john i was watching the movie with groaned.And by the way tormenting animals is how people who end up tormenting humans get their first introduction.These 5 and 4 star reviews don't indicate the real numbers of people who like this film,let alone the majority of people who support an ethical treatment towards animals.So i suggest the rave reviews are there because of the sick manics out there who have to prove their o.t.ness to be something special.Real people just groan and avoid the sensationalism of even bothering to post any review.The music throughout is really cheesy for the genre and kept reminding me of the silly dialogue at the start of a cheap porn movie."
1,"Overhyped, Cruel BORING","Even if you cut the sadistic and immoral animal kill/torture scenes from this turkey, this video would be unwatchable for several reasons. The premise is weak, actors subpar, the soundtrack sounds more 1950's than 1970's.Worse, there is very lttle suspense, it's basic filler material of a group traveling through the rain forest and the ""meat"" in this malnourishing stew are a few scenes of gore, some with real and live animals.I love my prime rib rare. I don't care about how Mr.Chicken makes his way into my frying pan. However I don't appreciate cowards killing helpless creatures as a substitute for good gore FX or suspenseful filmmaking."
5,Wow....,"Wow...absoluely horrifying, gruesome, realistic, and just...wow. I had always heard of this film and finally found and purchased it. I watched it once and I have to say, while it deeply troubled me with the realization of how human beings treat one another, I find the film maker to be ingenious in his work. Though it is obvious in it's cinematics, the ""film reels"" were captured in undenying and unrelenting realism. I found myself wondering how in the world Barbareschi made such a realistic film. Definitely not for the faint of heart or for those with a weak stomach, but definitely worth seeing."
5,Masterpiece,"Its sick,shocking,disturbing,cruel all those things but there is a meaning to this film if you can look past all the horrible stuff you might realize this is more than just a sick exploitation flick"
2,the reviews were right,I read the reviews that said the magnets don't stay on. I thought maybe people were exagerating. They weren't. I have no idea where i lost the little magnets when i wore them. The size is nice but they need a stronger adhesive.
5,Homedics MAG-10 Magna Dots,"I purchased these magnets for my wife and she uses them on spots that cause her pain. The adhesive is not all that great so she usually puts a little bit of adhesive tape over the dot to keep it in place. These are 1000 gaus magnets which are perfect for pain relief. It may all be in your head but if the wearer believes the magnets work, they work. It may not be for you but my wife swears by them."
3,MAGNA DOT,ADHESIVE WEAK. FALLS OFF SOAKS UP WATER LIKE A SPONGE.ANOTHER MATERIAL ON PRODUCT PURCHASED IN JAPAN HOLDSUP MUCH BETTER.TED D
5,A great TwenCen work,"I bought this a couple of years ago and it has remained a strong favourite of mine. Songcircle sing this work with great style and commitment and make the harmonic singing sound very beautiful. The work features all the things we know and love about Stockhausen, including the composer's whimsical sense of humour.I strongly recommend this disc even to those who are not normally fans of TwenCen music.This work, Carré, Gruppen and Mantra [also by Stockhausen] are amongst my favourites at the moment.What a fascinating composer is Herr Stockhausen!"
1,smile,I actually can't believe the other reviewers gave this 5 stars. The album in its entire made me smile in remembrance of blubbering my lips and making funny noises when I was a child. Maybe it is a masterpiece in Avant-Garde but it is not something I would truly listen to with any enjoyment. I consider myself pretty liberal about experimental music but this just goes to far.
4,this book is great!!!!!!!!!!,"In this book Amy Chandler goes to Washington DC the place where she was created. It's a class trip and her mother gets to come and be a class chaperone. Nancy, Amy's mother, see's one of her old friends but something really bad happened to them in the past and Nancy has hated and not trusted him since then. Tehn the entire class is on a bus ride when the driver goes crazy and pulls a gun out on the whole class he stops the bus and tells every body to get out of the bus except Amy. Will Amy be able to surive the pshyco man and get out of Washington DC before she is killed. Find out when u read this really great book,."
4,Good buy,"I ordered this for my 4 year old twin boys who are crazy about the Power Rangers and they just love it. The only problem I had was in the description it says the helmet opens to reveal the Ranger's face and the helmet DOES NOT open. Still, my boys like the sayings and just the fact that it a Power Ranger!!!"
5,Quality Flatware,I registered for the WMF Linea flatware for my wedding 5 years ago...it still looks as good as it did the first time I used it! It may be a bit pricey but well worth the expense. I love that the style is so elegant and timeless.
5,"Calm, contemplative, and enlightening.","An excellent introduction to the Desert Father's spirituality, lives, and way of life. Great for the beginner or the advanced in the study of God, love, solitude, contemplation, and faith. This should be on the shelf of every church library; Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant, and in the homes of every person who attains to a higher love and true communion with God."
5,Outstanding book for advanced players,"""The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle"" (Paperback) is an excellent book for Irish flute and tin Whistle players, but I would not recommend it to a beginner. It has great examples of advanced techniques and is well written. Many hours went into its creation. It is the most complete book I have seen on these topics.""The Clarke Tin Whistle: Deluxe Edition"" (Book & CD) (Paperback) by Bill Ochs, is the book I suggest you start with if you are a beginner with the Tin Whistle. Then you can graduate to ""The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle""."
2,"Maybe for the dead, serious professional?","I found the book a wee over-written for a beginning text: there is an analysis of the scales used by Neanderthal bone flutes-- p. 49; a scholarly differention between ""pitches"" and ""notes"" (notes have duration) -- p. 20; a description of the scales used by the ancient Greeks--p. 23, etc., etc. While I found the discussion of Neanderthal bone flutes interesting, when I reached that point in the book I concluded that this fellow intended to bore potential competition into a coma, so I hefted the book--all 480 pages--back on the shelf for possible reference after I've learned to play somewhere else.When I find a good elementary text, I'll add it to this review."
2,Too dated to be useful...,"Perhaps a sign of the hi-tech times, this book was published in 1996 and is now so dated it is of very limited value. If you read newspapers, or some financial magazines, I think you're already well past what is offered here. One facet of the book I actually found a little irritating is the tendency of the author to use copious amounts of filler between the tidbits of useful information."
2,A Waste of Time,"There is not much new here. Not much worth thinking about. And quite a bit that is wrong or misleading. The author's favorite exampe of a tech ""winner"" is Compaq. If you'd bought Compaq early you might now be a millionaire. Duh. But his example for internet stocks is... Netscape! The book was out-of-date on Netscape when it came out last year. The author brags about his fund's return. Well, if you read the Motley Fool you know he's done about average and you know that almost all his ""conservative"" advice is pretty worthless. He has a couple insights on timing and a couple interesting things to say about how tech stocks don't act quite as contrarian as the average Dow Jones stock and maybe a couple other insights.Overall, thin gruel. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. (I read two chapters, skimmed three others, and put my copy on a back shelf to gather dust.)"
4,Excellent insights for picking high-teck stocks,"High-tech stocks are almost impossible to buy below their book-values, and their businesses are hard to understand. No wonder, Warren Buffet stays away. Nevertheless, technology continues to be one of the most rewarding areas to invest in. Gianturco analyzes the criteria that a small investor can use as a guide in this volatile sector."
5,"If you want the facts, this is the book for you!","If you want the facts, this is the book for you! Michael Gianturco is a genius at presenting information in a way that makes you feel like a master of the subject. Michael allows you to see the whole picture of Technology stocks and what they can offer you. I have been investing in technology stocks for a year now. After reading his book, I now have a powerful resource to help me make more money. Put it to use for you in your portfolio selection"
1,Junk just as others have said,"Reasonably put together except for the lousy gate mechanism. Just as others have said this thing only opens and closes when the unit is empty. Put any material in it and you have a gate that is stuck open with material pouring out. This unit was simply not tested in development, there is no way anyone who used this thing would approve it for mass distribution."
2,Big Disapointement,"Solidly built except for the Gate machanism. It jams constantely. Very POOR design of this item.Otherwise, it would be a great spreader.Knowing and owning other Agri-Fab products, I'm very surprised that they come out with shuch a lousy mechanism for the opening gate.If it wasn't for that (it makes it a very expensive conversation piece, good only as a yard ornament) I would give it a five star rating"
1,Don't buy before you read!,"The spreader works great, until you have to close the hopper. The slide rails get clogged and the slide won't close, then when you manually push the slide close, it won't open correctly. I called tech support and they said to spray it with Pledge, done that, doesn't work."
1,wasn't feeling it,dig older TLC stuff but this track seemed like any other song that i'll hear on the radio&that's not good when they usually come out with there first Song.not feeling this one.

3,nice shoe but slightly more cramped than usual for me,I love skechers oxfords and wore out my last one so I decided to purchase the tredds flee. The color is exactly as shown in amazon's photograph and looks almost mahoganny under sunlight. I'm usually a consistent size 7 when it comes to skechers oxfords but I felt that a 7.5 would have been a better fit for this pair. I would perhaps recommend going up a half size if you are considering buying this shoe.
2,love skechers brand but.....,"when I order these I got two different color brown tone shoes, the left shoe is a darker brown, little disapointed! Thought they were cute, nice style, its a shame."
3,This was no gift.,"David Richo is obviously intelligent and armed with a stunning vocabulary. However, this said, he never manages to get beyond the academic and esoteric when discussing synchronicity. Although he is quite informative when speaking about different religions and metaphysics in general, he is unable to explain clearly how we as individuals should go about understanding, creating and applying synchronicity in our daily lives. There are ""lessons"" at the end of each chapter, but these seem almost an after thought. I was very anxious to get my copy of this book, but was more than just slightly disappointed when I finally was able to read it."
4,Unexpected Miracles,Mr. Richo provides a wealth of information on the subject of Synchronicity. His work in this important field of study provides those of us who speak and write on the subject with a broader context upon which to help people who want to learn to understand the gift of synchronicity and learn to believe in the possibility of a lifetime filled of miracles.
5,Jura-Capresso S9 Avantgard,"This machine is a coffee lover's dream, and allows you to customize and brew coffee exactly the way you like it. The brewed coffee and steamed milk are always nice and hot too! The machine is top quality, and also keeps your cups warm on top. Its elegance will grace any home or office, and make any owner proud.Richard Vaughan, Jacksonville, FL"
1,Beautiful but Defective,"What a beautiful machine. We were very excited to taste the first freshly brewed cup of coffee, on demand, but it never dispensed. The brewing process came to an abrupt halt and the display said ""Empty Tray."" Alas, the tray was already empty. Despite repeated attempts to brew another cup, it kept freezing at the same point with the same ""Empty Tray"" message. We called the manufacturer. They were were very kind and responsive, but told us to return the machine as it was defective. We are exchanging it for a new one with the hopes that this one will work. Hopefully, a better review will follow."
3,"Honestly, just use real fruit & veg.","I keep four different reptiles and frankly as I learn more I find this is a bit of a waste of money, if you eat any fruit and vegetables yourself.Crickets and mealworms will devour real greens with more gusto than this stuff and they eat so little that you can just cut a tiny bit off kitchen scraps and you'll be fine.Important to note: I dust the crickets and worms occasionally so calcium and vitamins are secondary to getting the insects moisture and natural trace elements.These cubes are ok, but it's unlikely I'll buy another jar. Save the dosh and buy an apple."
2,Not Very Useful For This Novice,This book seems to be a Southwestern and Texas version of Newcomb's Wildflower Guide - though the organization is different as this one is organized based on color (with B&W drawings?). Descriptive information is pretty much the same as well as the drawings - the vast majority of which are in black and white - and the color ones don't have enough detail to help much with identification - at least not for this beginner.
3,Good start,The Acacia Strain's debut was a decent effort by a bands debut album. It's easily forgettable when compared to the bands other releases.
5,Great rice,"This sushi rice was great,, would buy again. It was nice and sticky for rolling with nori sheets.It cooked nicely in the rice cooker"
3,sushi rice,"Been ill,haven't in all fairness, able to try out/taste product.Did not like the hi frt. cost-almost was what item sold for!So sorry............"
5,Excellent rice.,"I love Kokuho Rose rice and have been eating it since the early 80's. The only problem has been finding it in something other than 10 lb. bags. The 5 lb. bag is the perfect size and the rice itself is great eating, and you can eat this rice all by itself, no topping/flavoring necessary."
5,Very nice,right out of the bag this rice looks good and smells good...used it in a rice cooker with great results...perfect consistency for making sushi
1,rice tastes like chemical,"I purchased this rice for my son. He just received it yesterday and opened it today...says it tastes like chemicals but can't return it because it's an open, food product. So unfair... any solutions? it costs $13.99 for a bag. such a waste of money!!"
3,What are the dimensions of this tray?,"I love the look of this tray, but the dimensions are not listed. Can someone who purchased the item please review it and list the dimentions? Thank you!"
4,the 'cracker's dad tells all,"as bill landreth's father--from 'trs-80' to his 'franklin ace', i may assure anyone that he was the core of the 'inner-circle', no second place. i paid his 4-digit phone bills, was present as the FBI scoured a mansion for evidence--his group easily hacked the CIA, Nasa, NSA, Norad and any operative Big mainframes--they did no damage, and simply sought knowledge. confined for 90 days, he was released swiftly after scrutiny that revealed an IQ of 183, and no criminal intent. his book may now be'dated', but look a those acquiring it--a good 'security' primer still."
2,More fiction than fact?,"While this book was an interesting read when it first came out in 1985 it has dated considerably. It was written around the time when the media was getting interested in hacking and there were a few high-profile cases. Lots of people were coming forward and admitting they were ""ex-hackers"" and were trying to cash in on the public interest. My copy of this book even has the typical photo of the author with a black box over his eyes!The Phrack Inc. newsletter had this to say about the author, Bill Landreth: ""The book was definitely more fiction than fact as it tried to make everyone believe that not only did The Cracker form the Inner Circle, but that it was the first group ever created. However, for starters, The Cracker was a second-rate member of Inner Circle II. The publicity from the book may have served to bring him some dollars, but it ultimately focused more negative attention on the community adding to an already intense situation."""
2,Expected More,"Totally expected more. Lonely deployment in Iraq made this PSP disc pretty good, but definitely could have been better. Great looking ladies, but not nearly enough action."
1,Disappointing and kind of bland,"How they could mess up a video like this is beyond me, but somehow they did! Yes the women are pretty, and I have no complaints with the casting. But there's nothing erotic about the story itself. There's an opening encounter with Casey and a female model that started out pretty hot, but then fizzles out immediately as the director doesn't even try to make it seductive. Both women instead just start making out for no reason and take turns doing eachother. Again, how they could mess this up is beyond me, but they did."
2,Don't buy these for a beach house!,"Bought these 2 years ago for our house at the beach and they already need to be replaced. They corroded so badly, they are falling off the house! I'm annoyed because before I spent all that money for them (I bought 10) I wanted to make sure they would withstand the elements so close to the ocean. I contacted the company and was told that they would not rust or corrode. Not true.... now they all need to be replaced. I suppose now I'll have to buy those cheap, ugly plastic lights that everyone else uses. Oh well... I really loved the look of them, but you and you learn, right?Sea Gull Lighting 8870-44 Outdoor One-Light Wall Lantern, Weathered Copper Finish"
2,"Looked awesome for a year, SALT killed it",This plate looked great for a year then it started to pit. If you live where theres no snow you should be fine.
5,Flatware,"I bought these because my grandmother has had a set of wfm stainless flatware forever. They are very durable, and I have not noticed any wear whatsoever so far. I have been very happy with the purchase. At $50 for the set of 4, they were a great deal."
5,Excellent Flatware and a Bargain,This is a set of very high quality flatware for the price. I've found the finish to be extremely durable and the design is quite elegant.
3,"a ""lite"" read; not too captivating","I found this book ""OK"". Wasn't great, wasn't terrible. I didn't find this book to be very deep. It went many different directions with different characters, but none on a deep level. The writing style was again, just OK. In the end, I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
2,White Lace and Promises,"All the reviews set me up for a major dissapointment with this one. What promised to be a complex and comical read was like a first draft of a bigger, better story. It doesn't grab you until midway, if then. Using the guests at the wedding to pursue so many (too many?)complex topics...love, marriage, infidelity,spousal abuse... was effective. But, each issue appears quickly and dissappears just as fast. There are a lot of disconnected essays and character sketches set in the middle of a tacky wedding. Characters are not fleshed out. It's hard to care about what happens to anyone in this story. Given about 200 more pages this could have been a much more satisfying read.No more Ansay for me."
2,Disappointed.,"After having read Vinegar Hill, I was looking forward to reading Midnight Champagne but was disappointed. The story did not appear organized and was difficult to follow. The character development was vague. I wouldn't recommend this book to friends."
2,This should not have been an Amazon recommendation,"After reading Vinegar Hill, I expected a lot more insight and subtlety from this book. It was not to be found. I thought the description of these middle America, middle income types were trite and often cruel. Do people like this exist? Of course they do. But to make a blanket statement about a whole group is grossly unfair. It should not be assumed that people who don't have much money necessarily have poor taste. The bride's gown was a little much! Amazon recommended this book. Shame on you!"
4,What good literature is all about.,"Magnificent story. Well-elaborated plot. The author takes us through the adventures of some of the participant to a wedding in the middle of a winter storm. The plot develops right in front of our eyes with incredible logic. Smooth transitions from scene to scene. Little by little all pieces of information fall into place and you can't help but to fully understand the human side of the characters (as well as the not-so-human characters) I do recommend this book. Easy to read, wonderful writing. Leaves you with the taste of good literature."
3,Midnight Beer,"I had higher expectations for this book. It was a quick read which was a plus, I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was like I was expecting midnight champagne and got beer served to me instead."
5,Don't judge Ansay by Vinegar Hill....,"I was pretty soured on A. Manette Ansay after finishing Vinegar Hill. I just never got into the book and was not impressed by the ending. However, I picked up Midnight Champagne randomly at the bookstore for a 'vacation read' and I must say that Ansay has been redeemed! I loved Midnight Champagne and would highly recommend it (even if you didn't enjoy Vinegar Hill!)"
4,Can't You Hear the Wedding Bells?,"This book was the second of Ansay's which I have read. I very much enjoyed the book, a trip through April and Caleb's wedding in the midst of a terrible blizzard.The wedding itself is nearly an afterthought as Ansay delves into each character's lives and thoughts, including the children in attendance, the people who work at the hotel where the wedding takes place, the families of the bride and groom, and other guests who are staying in the hotel.The story is rich with detail and looks at the issues of marriage, what it means to the many guests (invited and uninvited), what love means to teenagers, newly weds, not-so-newly weds, divorcees, and people who aren't in love, rejected. The concept of family swirls through the book, and an interesting subplot leads to even more interest and suspense.I hope readers out there will enjoy this as much as I did!"
3,Just O.K.,"After I read Vinger Hill, I swore I'd never read another Ansay book again. But, after reading many of the comments from this site, I decided I'd try her again. After a very slow start to the book, I did begin to enjoy a few character story lines but mostly they didn't grab me. This book was okay, not great and not bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like past Ansay books."
2,Blech,"What a chore this book was to read. If it weren't for my OCD about finishing books that I start, I would've read the first couple of chapters and then given up.It seems like a wannabe-suspense, but it's not. It seems like there might be a love story in it, but there's not. It feels like there might be a creepy angle in it, but there is not. What I can gather about this book is that the author thinks she's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy. She tries to make a connection, but falls WAY short. Read Vinegar Hill - that one was worth it. Pass Midnight Champagne by."
5,Raise your glass to A. Manette Ansay.,"Members of my reading group recommended this, my first A. Manette Ansay book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was reminded of one of those 'fly on the wall' documentaries that are so popular at the moment. I was able to sit in, watching and listening to a whole cast of characters as they interacted (or didn't), from ceremony and reception, through to the bouquet toss and midnight champagne. Better still, I was even privy to their individual thoughts and dreams. The blurb on my book cover, talks of two stories, April and Caleb's wedding and the Hideaway Lodge quarrel, intersecting, but I felt there were dozens of stories weaving in and out of each other and culminating in what I thought was the perfect champagne toast. The characters are beautifully drawn and I defy anyone not to find at least one they recognise from their own family. From the opening page, I was drawn into a world so real, I could swear I was there, in my glad rags, enjoying the wedding myself."
3,"Interesting, but...","There were definitely parts of this book that I enjoyed and it was definitely a FAST read. However, there were almost too many characters for this relatively short book. I found it difficult to really ""care"" about a lot of them or become immersed in the story line (or lines). It was well written but not altogether captivating. When I reached the finish, I realized that I really didn't ""care"" how the novel ended."
3,Prod. Review,"The only thing I disliked was that the front of the ""t.v."" screen had some little scuff marks, but she loves it regardless and I know she'll end up chewing it anyways, hahaha."
2,You will not be able to speak spanish in 10 days,"I believe the Pimsleur method is a good way to learn a language However the material present in this product is too insufficient to give anyone any sort of command or comfort in speaking or listening to Spanish. The product includes the first ten lessons of Pimsleur Spanish 1. It seems to me the folks marketing this product are looking for a quick buck by attracting customers with cheaper prices. This is more suitable for a tourist who would just like to have fun by saying a few sentences in Spanish. For those wishing a better understanding, I suggest getting the full Pimsleur Spanish 1."
5,The original how to excel on the sales floor in commissioned sales primer,"Furniture SalesAuto SalesTrade Show SalesClothing SalesAppliance SalesSpecialty Retailer Sales...So many people concentrate on etail and 'professional' selling, that they forget that this classic 'how to sell on the sales floor,' was once (and still could be) a wonderful route to the American Dream.If you are a commissioned 'floor salesperson,' buy this book, learn it's lessons, and make your fortune."
2,"Figures don't lie, but liars can figure...","I'm sure once you wade through all of his unsupported statistics, you'll find some useful advice from Mr. Lawhon, but I'm completely turned off by his assertions of 75% of this and 25% of that, for which he has no documentation. If only I still owned the book (I was reimbursed for it by my employer), I would go back through it with a pen and redline all the useless crap. After reading Book One, I feel discouraged, which is perhaps what the author wanted--to discourage anyone who wasn't wholeheartedly committed to selling. (I started to write ""110% committed,"" but then I would be guilty of misusing percentages in much the same manner as Mr. Lawhon.)"
4,Salman Piracha's Review,"Pocket City Atlas: United States, Canada, Mexico is an easy to use guide to help you move around and explore these exotic North American dream places. This pictorial atlas has all the details for a smooth vacation. Only one sentence can be said for this pocket book. ""NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT!"""
1,Not all recommendations work out.,"I have to say I was very disapointed in the book after having it recommended to me on a message board. I found the content and underlying philosphies lacking in strong moral fiber that a daughter or son need to make their own way in the world. A parent cannot always be a best friend when it comes to helping children understand rules and expectations. If a measure of success according to the author (page 75), is whether a daughter avoids STD or pregnancy it is a sad commentary on raising children."
5,wow,"First up, yes I like the Backstreet Boys, but I had no idea Nick could sing like THIS. In my opinion he sounds better than I've EVER heard him. Payback is the coolest song - why isnt it on the album??"
3,Not what I was expecting,Nice set but these things are just huge. Not was I was expecting at all. Need big drawers to store these.
2,Disappointing.,"Buyers beware; this dvd is NOT an official studio product. It is a DVDR made by a private company. This quality is therefore only fair, and there are absolutely no extras. My main complaint though, is the dubbing. It is awful and unfortunately a pet hate of mine. I would prefer to see see the non English speaking actors speaking in their native tongue with sub-titles showing. The script is corny and typical of low budget films of that era. The premise is a good one; soldiers from two opposing sides meeting up again after a previous encounter, but the opportunity for an excellent film was lost, in my view, due mainly by the low budget and poor script. This type of thing was dealt with much better in the Lee Marvin film, Hell in the Pacific(?)."
1,Not a good gift,"I bought this as a gift for someone however it could not be used as a gift as it just comes with all of the pieces thrown in a cardboard box instead of a box with places outlined for each piece. Not only was it not in the proper box, the set looked really cheap and flimsy. This product really sucks."
2,Thank God I didn't buy this game,"I was one of the few people who actually enjoyed Angel of Darkness. The controls were absolutely terrible, but it made it a challenge and I was able to overcome it and beat the game. I thought the story was interesting and the graphics pretty good (though not near as good a current TR games). This DVD game pretty much takes all of the fun out of the game. I would rather just watch the gameplay than have to mess with the DVD commands. It's not fun. I never feel like I'm controlling Lara anyway. Entering in commands is just annoying.One thing funny is that, although the game is played with perfection (meaning that jumps are never missed) you can still tell how bad the controls are and how Lara still controls like a truck."
5,Definitely recommend,"My husband and I have only been married for two years and we wanted to start doing a devotional together. Night Light is wonderful! It has brought us closer together and I can already see changes in our relationship. We are beginning to get a better understandig of each other and how we each respond to life's issues. It has made our relationship stronger and, best of all, it has made God the central focus of our lives. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great devotional, we love it so much that we have bought some copies for our friends."
5,Night LIght for Couples,My husband and I buy this for every newly married couple. It is a time that encourages a closer walk with God and has questions that help the husband and wife grow closer to each other. Yet it is only one page of reading and can be done right before bed. We loved it!
5,Sweet Dreams,"Any couple ending their day with this devotional from one of America's great marriage experts will find sweet dreams. The essays are thought provoking and the questions at the end, though they sometimes make you squirm, also open up emotions, dreams, conversations that otherwise might not be shared. A great way to end the day-together."
5,Night Light,This devotional is amazing!! Whether you are married or considering marriage it will definitely enhance and challenge your relationship. You grow closer to eachother and truly see and understand the Lord's plan for your relationship. The topics are extremely relevant and the time each day to do it is about 10-15 minutes so it's a perfect way to end the day.
4,"Good, but not great...","""Night Light: A Devotional for Couples"" is a very good devotional, but there are a couple points that keep it from going beyond that...1. While my husband and I enjoy the questions at the end of each devotional, it is at times apparent that some were designed for couples who have been married longer than three months. Much longer.2. Unlike the ""Love Dare"" devotional I have seen in stores, it does not provide a ""Delve Deeper"" section, providing further reading. I feel like a devotional should be more devoted to the Bible than cute stories or insightful couple-related questions.All in all, we have enjoyed this devotional, but the questions and thin Biblical aspect makes it merely ""good"" instead of ""great."" However, I won't be jumping to the ""Love Dare"" one necessarily, since it provides the deeper reading but no couple questions. I really believe both are important."
5,Great devotions before bed,"These devotions are quick a must in todays world. They have questions to ask each other afterwards, some of the questions can be confusing but most of them are good and edifying to recieve answers too."
5,Great couples devaotional,A wonderful book for couples looking for devotional time together. I would recommend it to any couple seeking to improve their spiritual life as a couple.
3,Depends on what you're looking for,"I bought this for my husband and I to do devotions, but he's not really a Christian so it fell through the cracks and I haven't read much of it yet. As far as Christian books for couples, it's better than other's I've read, but not as good as some, if that helps. I do love Dr. Dobson, though."
3,"OK, I Suppose","I have to admit, I purchased this because of the author, and was not impressed overall. Though the devotionals are good and I like the questions at the end that you should answer together, I felt it was very dry in some spots and hard to stay awake for."
3,A Devotional for new couples!,"My husband and I recently bought this book as our first couples devotional. We have enjoyed the topics, which can be covered in literally minutes. Coincidentally that is my one complaint. With the lessons being so short, it does not leave much room for conversation. You basically read one verse from the Bible and answer 3 questions about each other and/or your relationship. My spouse and I have been together for many years so most of the questions are areas that we have already covered. I gave the book a mid grade of 3 stars because although we have enjoyed the scripture verses nightly, it still is not very thought provoking. However, I think this would be a great book for couples who are just starting out together."
5,HIDDEN GOLD IS REAL GOLD,"THIS IS A FABULOUS RESOURCE THAT tells all. I came away convinced that monthly giving will be successful for almost any non-profit. Perhaps more importantly, if a non-profit doesn't embrace this form of giving they will be losing dollars and donors to competitors. There are many wonderful examples and probably hundreds of useful ideas. The writing style is easy to understand, often quite witty, a rarity in martketing and fundraising books, and there's a perfect balance between practical tips and creative options. One of the best fundraising books I own, and I own a lot of them. It will be considered a fundraising classic."
4,A (...)gangster that isn't one of the Krays!,"A nice little introduction to the dark side of swinging 60's London.Rent boys,old lags on bombers,ska loving skins and (...)jewish gangsters, these are a few of the interesting characters we meet in this well written ode to a special time in the Citys criminal history.The second book in Arnotts trilogy flings us around the night clubs,seedy east end drinking dens and aristocratic country estate parties of merry old England following the murder investigation of a rent boy,dodging a bent cop and trying to make some cash at good old fashioned gangsterism.At the same time the author details the changes in english youth culture during that period in a very enjoyable way.Well worth the 5 bob!"
3,Pleasant Diversion for a Couple of Days,"Arnott's book is basically a quick-read, light novel, but it uses some interesting devices from more ""serious"" literature to make an engaging little book. The book focuses on Harry, a gangster in 60s London, but it does it by portraying him solely through the eyes of others. The book has five sections, each of which is written from within the perspective of each of 5 characters who relate to Harry in markedly different ways. Some characters are handled more effectively than others, but overall it is competently done. The gay sex scenes are described with more enthusiasm than the straight, and the last section in which the relevant character is a professor becomes somewhat didactic, but otherwise it is fairly well-balanced. I enjoyed reading it, and would have been happy for it to continue."
4,"The Swinging, Killing Sixties","This is the other side of England's Swinging Sixties - the underworld. Arnott weaves dozens of real-life villains and weirdos - the killer Kray twins, Roger Moore's ex-wife Dorothy Squires - into a truly unique gangster novel. Non-Brits may find it hard to differentiate between fact and fiction - but they won't care. It's a compelling, violent read."
1,Poorly written and complicated.,"This book is typical of being written by a white person. The book is about a white woman documenting gang styles and graffiti. She wanders around south central with a camera in her bag and tries to become friends with the members. she often refer's to these people as her ""friends"" such as my ""friends"" from ( ) gang. The photos are nothing you can't find anywhere else. I have seen all photos similar to these in other books and magazines. If people are so interested in seeing this thing simply jump in a car and drive around south central yourself. The book is very un orginized and over all I think it's [bad]. I grew up in south central so I would know."
1,"confused, misguided and poorly written","wallbangin' first off is badly in need of editing. constructions like, ""remarkably successfully"", make this text even more difficult to read. gang writing is one aspect of gang culture, whereas for graffiti writers, writing, for fame, style, etc. is the focal point of the culture. the constant blurring of these facts makes it difficult to discern the actual arguement. this book is all over the place and leaves us with a poor, undetailed account into two separate cultures, simply because they use public space for unintended purposes."
1,The two subjects couldn't be more distant...,Taggers and gangbangers are two very different types of people. Don't confuse the two.
1,Not well put together,"Book was poorly put together. Scattered pictures throughout the book. She put herself in serious danger trying to take these pictures...i know how south central is and people who are white will get either robbed or killed in some way or another usually not in a car of course. I don't really understand the point of the book what is it for? We already know about the crips and bloods etc; people are looking for answers to problems not listening to her rave about her Geertzian ghetto or whatever the hell it was. It's no problem that she is white in my opinion...she seems to have a little self-hate problem, for instanceshe says: i was on 103rd street when a black man charged at me on his bike of hate of my whiteness""DUH...she is white in WATTS an entirely black area so of course people will treat her as what she is. whatever the book was WACK"
3,Was expecting more. Over priced.,"I was expecting a lot more of this book. It's probably a good book for a business person to understand technical infrastructure but for those already in IT, it is more of a review. For example, chapter 6 talks about DSL, VOIP, and how cellular networks work. For people in the technical field the level that this book goes into is pretty much known but for those in non technical areas or just getting in technology then its a good book.Main issue I have is the price. For the price I think the book is very much lacking the level of technical review that is required to fully understand data networks. If you want to really understand networking, pick up a Cisco book for a lot less. To me this book should be no more than fifty dollars."
3,Returns are easy,"I purchased this item for my 1997 GMC p/u.... which it did not fit.!! The item was returned with no problem, and my account was credited. A job well done, thanks...... DRH"
1,Do not order from Amazon.,"The price may be right, but mine came without mounting hardware. It clearly was one that someone had returned without returning the hardware."
4,Rather Narrow,"I had had 3"" pins from long ago and was sorry when they eventually, you know, gone one by one. So, when I found these 3"" I happily ordered 1lb box. Minor disappointment is these pins are 3/16"" wide, while I used to much wider ones."
4,"Bell Trigger Youth Bicycle Helmet, Black/Red Brandana",It's perfect for my 4 yr. old toddler. Well made and he loves the way it looks. Great for a boy!
4,The meaning of each moment in the cycle,"This slim book covers all of the 8 festivals celebrated in the pagan tradition. The cycle of the seasons, the cycle of nature. There are things to make, meditations to focus on, poems, recipes and much more. Key words for each season help you focus in on the feel and meaning of each moment in the wheel of the year. I have enjoyed it and it will be put to good use with my other books which are much like it, Circle Round and A Calendar of Festivals by Marian Green"
5,Huckabee's Book is Fun and Uplifting,Great humor and a straight forward message from someone who knows the struggles of being overweight in the US today.
4,Loaf's loss leaves less lard lately. Like limited leap leftward. Laughed and laughed.,"The trouble with this book is his allusions to all the yummy yummy things he's given up eating. Cheese grits, biscuits, Little Rock's favourite chicken-fried steak, bar-b-qued pork, Whoo Pig ice cream. Ouch.But his cheerleading and encouragement crosses party lines and is apparently infectious, lots of folks speak about how this book has helped them. It has clearly helped Governor Huckabee, he was a real loaf before twelving his way to a waistline refit.The 12-Stops are a little forced, probably to conform to world view that everything self help has to have a 12 in it somewhere (I'm still waiting for numerologist Calypso Louie Farrakhan's entry to the field). But with those criticisms in mind, this is easily digestible and achievable weight loss advice."
3,Not BAd,"Not bad for a used book. That's what I ordered and I got what I expected, so not disappointed. Worth the price."
4,I am like him,"Wow, I am 50 and he lbs keep piling on. I am not one to excercise and definitly eat emotionally. Read the book in one sitting. Started out and have continued to walk for 30 miles each day. Since it is a 12 step, I need to read the book again. This is so to the heart that I will overcome my weakness and be the person I know I am inside and out."
4,Quit digging your grave with a knife and a fork,"I purchased this book for my husband who is obese. He read it, said it was good, but pointed out to me that the author has regained his weight. I will read the book hoping to assist my husband into applying the 12 steps so he can begin a healthy lifestyle. Amazon was terrific and I received the book in excellent condition in a matter of days. Going forward, I believe this is a terrific way to purchase books."
4,Do-able !,Mike Huckabee presents a simple plan with do-able advise. It's an easy read that includes many stories and parables remniscent of a Sunday morning sermon. Dollar for dollar it's worth the money. I enjoyed reading it.
2,Proof is in the pudding - the man is fat again,"Mike Huckabee is fat again, and making the usual excuses one would make - he is busy.His book says there should be no excuses. One could have predicted his weight gain with how simple he made the process sound. Lifestyle change can be repeated over and over, it doesn't mean anything without more specifics.Save your money for a weight loss book with strategies that actually work. Not one filled with tripe that obviously don't work if the AUTHOR cannot even maintain weight loss. Hear is a guy who was told he was going to DIE, and he still can't keep the weight off"
4,Weight,"I've had the same problem, I needed this book to evaluate myself and it did, Mr. Huckabee is my same age."
5,"Dismayed to see that, despite this great book, he's gained it all back!","This book made me (liberal christian _lefty_) really like Huckabee. He gives great diet advice and talks about how health scare made him change his lifestyle, the way he eats, FOREVER. But sadly, just saw on TV how he's lost his way and gained it all back :( Such a disappointment, but also a testimony how very hard in our society it is to not just lose weight but keep it off. He said he used to carry a little cooler of grapes and healthy foods around to keep him away from the doughnuts, etc on the campaign trail. I'm guessing he doesn't do that anymore. I hope he will re-read his own book and get the inspiration I did from it and get healthy again. Diabetes is too difficult to fool around with and I hope he takes care of himself and gets back to his 12 stops. I often quote him ""if it says 'transfat on it, it might as well say 'poison'"""
4,"Easy to use, no frills","What can I say? It's a PoE injector. Just plug it in, attach the ethernet cables, and you're good to go.My one complaint is it doesn't appear to be compatible with gigabit ethernet. The gigabit device I plugged in only detects a 100 megabit connection."
3,(Not) A collection of demos and rarities,"If you're yearning for the days of DIY musical aesthetic and no production values, or if you're just looking to fill out your 7 Seconds back catalog, you might give this one a try. Fidelity is at a premium and the production is at best primitive, but none of this stuff is unlistenable. Nascent versions of songs that appear on _Crew_ (""Definite Choice"", ""I Have a Dream"", ""Here's Your Warning"", ""Clenched Fists, Black Eyes"") and _Walk Together, Rock Together_ (""No Class, No Way"" becomes ""Regress, No Way"") are mixed in with covers (an almost incomprehensible Nancy Sinatra cover) and other rarities. Probably a good collector's companion piece to _alt.music.hardcore_, a collection of their early 7"" and EPs. [edit: the reviewer from New York details the history of this album much more accurately than I did, but I stand by the basic sonic assessment.]"
5,Prevue ferret exercie pen,"I bought my first one several years ago and was so pleased that I bought some extensions and recently added a full 8 panel. I have six ferrets and these work great for it! I can use it with the mat or put a rug or tarp on the floor and make it any size and shape I want. They can't get out. Very easy to take down and put away, too. Would recommend to any ferret owner!"
2,You get what you pay for,"For the price, this kit is alright. I think if they charged a couple dollars more and put it in a regular case it would be much better. It is just a flimsy plastic tray that will break after a few uses."
1,I am not satisfied,"Hi,In my carving set those blades r very thin.When i used to carve that blades r broken.Thanks--samatha"
4,Very good price-performance,I like very much the construction of the case.The magnetic strip is PERFECT to securely hold the knives.
2,Passable but uninspiring,"I never stopped reading it because it was terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either. To be fair, it has a couple great plot twists, but all in all 5 pages of surprise aren't worth 500 pages of filler. It's a fence sitter book, that is, it sits on the fence between satire and serious and doesn't manage to do either well. The story is filled with ""funny"" place and character names (like Sultan Tummyfat and the harbours of Gulp and Guzzle) that make the writing whimsical without any kind of humour. In between this ""hilarity"" the book preaches a half baked stance of eugenics and environmentalism without any rational justification or explanation. Any kind of credibility Tepper gains with the latter is instantly torn down by the former. She has some interesting things to say about animal rights, but ultimately her Nazi-esque ideas about solving human over-population prevent me from taking her at all seriously."
2,Slow without closure,"This is a book that wants to be better than it is, it limps along without a focus. WHen we find the focus, it does not make sense! I wish I could get my money back."
1,A waste of time,"I read a lot of stories written by Sheri Tepper, all of them ranging from good to excellent, but this one made me sick! Unrealistic, a mixture of all kinds of standard SciFi / Fantasy elements tied together by a story without any highlights soaked with morale... really not a book the world was waiting for! sorry for every tree that has been cut to serve as paper for this ""book"""
2,Incoherent and boring,Started to read this book and gave up after having read one third. The storyline is disjointed and boring. Felt abused as a reader.
5,One of the best books I have ever read.,"Tepper's books are like works of art or exquisite pieces of music. Family Tree is one of her best, if not her best novel to date. This book should be required reading. Along with Grass, Gibbon's Decline and Fall, and Beauty. I can't say enough wonderful things about it. BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,Difficult to swallow,"The author believes humanity can be wiped out in the name of nature, but not a single tree can be cut in the name of humanity. Now you can read the book without the blinders on.I found both the premise and theme to be laughably absurd. The surprise identity of the characters from the future was a unique and wonderful twist (thus earning the book a second star), but the concluding merciless debasement of humanity was overbearing and left me sick.Never before have mass murderers (who nearly wipe us into extinction in hopes of lessening our evil interference with grass, trees and the like) been held in such regard as heroes of a novel. At least I hope not..."
4,The Animals Grow Up,"""The Family Tree"" by Sheri S. Tepper, 1997This story is a tree-hugging saga. Ms. Tepper is sort of interested in environmental stuff Another book of hers I read is about saving the animals of this world from decimation by progress. This is a story of animals becoming intelligent and self-aware. Dora Henry is a cop doing her best to keep the world safe. Her husband, Jared, is a creep. He does not abuse her or treat her badly, but he does not act husbandly towards her. It is the magic that he uses to keep her with him and for his ulterior motives, and he needs her for accomplishing his purpose.In the end we find a bit of truly odd things occurring. It is an incredible book, with a bit of magic and science and discovery through out."
4,So clever I was numb with admiration.,"Tepper's trademark plot twist is letting themajor characters--and readers--discover near theend of a book that nothing is what it seems to be,that there is a perfectly logical and unforeseenexplanation to the world she has taken you into,but it's nothing like what you thought it was.This book delivers, and then some. Even better,Tepper doesn't waste her brilliant surprises onanything that isn't important and meaningful.She is clever about all the right things. I willbe reading this book again just to appreciate incloser detail how wonderfully well written it is.I gave it a less than perfect score, though,because it just isn't as compelling as some ofher earlier (pre BEAUTY) novels. I liked hercharacters--but I wasn't in a state of urgencyto find out what would happen to them next."
2,Does not contain 2nd hole for colt ar-15 22lr,"Felt good until I went to install it. If you are buying this for an AR-15 22lr check your factory grip before purchasing. My colt ar .22 has 2 holes in the grip, one for the mounting screw and one for a small metal protrusion in the top of the grip. Would have modified but did not want to compromise the durability of the grip. Liked the style also but does not provide the wrap up design that covers the back of the trigger guard over and around."
5,Nice grip,Was easy to install and feels great. I installed on an M&P 15 and it did stick out to where the selector switch would not move freely. I just shaved a small area and the switch works just like it did before.
5,Fits like a glove!,"This pistol grip fits the gun well and my hand even better. Ten times more comfortable than a standard plastic mil-type grip. The rubber overmould is very helpful if your hands are sweaty or wet and you're manipulating the gun with one hand (during malfunctions, etc)."
5,I have seen a few Dummies try to say that Hogue is not made in USA,Boy are they wrong I happened to drive by their place last week while I was down their way. They are in CACA Land. Now many of you do not feel that CA CA is not in the USA I know they think they are better than us but honest they are still in the good ole USA.drayGranted CA CA is over 50% Hispanic still it is a long way from their to Mexico City.The one guy who is jumping up and down about the things coming from Mexico has reviewed two of these grips sets by hogue. the other one he gave a 3 star and this one a 2 star. If he hates them so much why is he buying them. dum de dum dum ddddddddddduuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmm only the facts maam.......
3,Almost Perfect but could be better!,"Fit's perfectly on my Smith Enterprises AR.Exactly what I expected from Hogue. Great grip, perfect ""tac"" and the grooves are nice.HOWEVER, if this grip had the extended palm swell towards the top of the grip similar to the ERGO style grips; it would be perfect!!! COME-ON HOGUE I have dreamed it now build it!"
5,"Excellent Quality, Reliability, and price!",I bought this Hogue grip over the popular MOE Magpul grip because of the finger groves and soft material it's made of. It's not too cheap feeling and holds up well in many conditions and sweaty hands! It's a bit difficult to get the bolt tightened enough on the inside when installing but make sure it's tight and it'll never come loose during handling of the weapon! There's even an insert you can buy to store extra batteries and such in the grip!
5,Best you'll find,"I am Marine Infantry.This is the best product going, as far as pistol grips go.Shipped FastInstalled EasyFeels perfectBuy it."
4,Good grip,Really great grip. I love hogue stuff. I have there stocks on one of my 10/22s and rem700. Only reason this one doesnt get 5 stars is its empty bottom id prefer to be able to put 2 aa or 123a bats would make it a 5-5
2,"Not the Hogue I remember, Made in Mexico","I have countless hogue products for my handguns, rifles, etc. I even have a older model of this Ar-15 grip. DO NOT BE FOOLED by the OLD photo Amazon has up, this grip is now made in Mexico to a lesser quality than their old grips. They are decent but if they are gonna move production out and skimp on quality they should at lease lower the price instead of increase it!Low stars due to Amazons misleading photo, lower quality than the older grips, and Made in Mexico."
5,"Get a GRIP, get a Hogue GRIP!","SWEET grip!! This is NICE. The FEEL is great. I wear XL gloves and this grip is IT. The material is phenomenal, semi tacky yet doesn't leave a residue. Only after thought would be to include the plug for the bottom of grip to secure extra batteries, earplugs, etc... Bottom Line I'd definitely buy this again!"
5,If You Dont Already Have One...Get One,One of the best additions to any firearm for the money that I have found. If You Dont Already Have One...Get One
4,Happy with this.,I ordered this and received it three days later. It feels great and I am looking forward to putting it on my AR. this is the last piece I needed for my tactical transformation.
4,love hogue grips,"second hogue on a rifle. used hogue on my pistols previously. grip is much better than factory grip. its longer, fills the hand better and is grippy without being sticky. only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - i can't get my hand up against the bottom the rifle without my trigger finger running downhill. if i slide my hand down slightly, my finger is straight to the trigger. for me, needs a little bigger ""swell"" at the top for the web of your thumb."
5,Best ever,"This grip goes on easy and looks great, the best thing is the way it feels in your hand. I spent 4 years in the USMC infantry and was used to the mill spec pistol grip we had there but wanted to try out the hogue grip I had herd good things about it. So for $20 it's a great price for a great product it fits my hanf perfectly and it's not to soft or to firm. you will not regret this purchase I plan on useing this on all my AR's and any I might get in the future."
3,Maybe if you have small hands,Great texture and hogue feel but too skinny for average to large hands. Also the fact that it doesnt have that extra material that curves up in the back is another negative.
5,A Must Have,The look and feel of the Hogue grip is beyond compare. Would have given it 10 stars if I could.
5,Great product,Huge improvement from stock. I always felt that the stock plastic handle on my ar cheapened the gun. I was right with this new grip it looks and fills amazin. I would recomend this grip to all my friends with an ar.
5,Hogue Rubber Grip is Awesome,"Have one on my AR, absolutely awesome! Comfortable and easy to grip I would rate more than 5 stars if I could!!!!!"
4,Hogue Rubber Grip Ar-15/M-16 Rubber Grip with Finger Grooves,Fits perfectly. Has a great soft but not total rubber feel. Highly recommended. Hogue makes some of the best grips
5,A+++,"Great feel on my mp15, amazon shipped it super fast. Installs with removal of one screw. This is a add on a ar must have!"
5,Great price for a Great grip,I just realized that I ordered my Hogue Rubber Grip directly from Hogue as I did not look here on Amazon.......DOH! I paid dearly for this blunder. Hogue website has this Grip priced at $24.95 add shipping and it cost me $34. DOUBLE! Almost. Anyway this is a fantastic grip very comfortable and gives you more control due to the nice fit. Moral of the story? CHECK AMAZON FIRST! LOL. Peace.
5,Hogue Grips,I think this is the best grip made for an AR rifle. They fit good and feel good. Much better than the standard plastic grips that come on most AR rifles.
5,WOW!!!,Who put this super glue on my right hand? Oh nevermind... I am just holding the Hogue Rubber Grip Ar-15/M-16 Rubber Grip with Finger Grooves!!!!!!! :)
5,Awesome Grip,"What a simple installation. The grip fits perfect, and feels great on my S&W M&P15. It gives the rifle the right ""feel"" when your holding it with one hand. I would say I have smaller hands and the grip is good as far as size. I recommend this grip to anyone that wants to replace their stock grip!"
5,Really nice feel.,Installed this grip on my oracle and M&P 15-22. Fit perfectly on the oracle and for the M&P I had to make a small and really shallow hole for second spring. No big deal and the grip feels really awesome.
5,Great grip!,"I bought this grip to replace the stock one on my Smith and Wesson M&P 15.I am a big fan of Hogue grips overall, as I've replaced the stock grips of all of my various firearms with them. The texture and feel of this grip is much more ergonomic, with the finger grooves making for a much more natural grip on the weapon. The rubberized surface also makes it easier to control and hold the gun with wet or sweaty hands. Highly recommended for anyone with an AR/M16/M4 style rifle."
5,great price,I was looking for new pistol grip 4 my ruger ar 15 and I could not pass this up do to the price. Other stores want 40 or so bucks and I paid 18. The only down side is it took alittle over a month to receive.
5,Super,"What can I say? It is a Hogue rubber grip for your assault rifle. Very nice texture that is quite ""grippy."" The finger placement seems perfect. Highly recommended. There are imitations out there but nothing beats a Hogue."
5,Nice Grip!,"More comfortable than the standard a2 grip! Looks good on my rock river, feels good in my hand, great buy!!!"
4,Comfortable AR grip,Feels great in your hand. My only regret is that I did not purchase the Hogue grip that has the built in storage. This is the same grip but has an open end vs. a latch to hold batteries or other items (be nice to have an easy place to store an allen wrench or two).Worth the money.
5,Worth it,"Is it worth about $20? Yes. I don't know why they don't come with a grip like this already installed. As others have said, don't loose the little spring that is held in by the grip. Take the grip off with the grip angled toward the ground, that way you are less likely to shoot that spring across the room (lol). Assemble with it facing up. When I pick up an AR without one of these, it feels cheap."
5,Perfect for What It's Supposed to Be - With a Caveat,"I'm just a little disappointed because I tried to make this product be something it wasn't, and that's my own fault entirely. But I bought it hoping to replace the grip on a Colt Umarex M4 Carbine in .22 LR, which appeared by all observation to be a regular M16 grip. It turns out that the Colt uses a *slightly* different setup and the Hogue won't fit properly.However, I'm not going to ding Hogue for that mistake, as it fits perfectly on a standard AR15 platform. Instead of the Colt I pulled out my Bushmaster and installed the Hogue on that, and it fits great and feels very nice in the hand. It's everything I'm come to expect of a Hogue product over the years, except that I notice on the package that they've outsourced production to Mexico now. Sigh. Better than China, though."
5,Perfect !,Just received and mounted this on my S&W M&P 15-22 and it is sweet ! Very comfortable and rubber grip makes for no slip.
5,Awesom,Im a huge fan of the Hogue grips anyway.I have them on every pistol i own. This one is no different.Feels great and looks like it belongs.Only took about 5 min. to install.
5,great comftorble feel,mounted it on my bushmaster carbon 15 . fits perfect .. Heads up 4.5 mm allen wrech needed to remove cap screw thru the handle... looks and feells great
5,Hogue AR Grip,"I had handled ARs with Hogue grips at the range and really liked the feel. After getting a Bushmaster and S&W M&P, I put Hogue grips on both of them. Would not change back, and haven't seen or felt anything better."
5,Quality Item,"Bought this for Chiappa m4 Pistol, and it is great, so much more comfortable than OEM. Good price, delivery slow thanks to USPS. Easy to install. just watch for the spring/springs. Thanks for another outstanding product from Hogue, well done Amazon."
5,Favorite Hot Cocoa,I received this hot cocoa as a gift last year and had not had it before. I thought it was absolutely delicious. Once I finished it I wanted more. I will be ordering more and share with others. :-)
4,"Two different styles, but both Must Reads for any Clancy Fan","Cardinal of the Kremlin brings back Ryan, but this time throws him into weapons talks with Russia. Great character development brings all of the characters alive as they are superbly interlaced throughout the novel.Red Storm Rising lives a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe. This novel is different from other Clancy novels, since it follows several distinct plot-lines and characters, instead of having one main and several off-shoots, as in Clancy's others. However, all of the different plots are well-written, and the technical aspects throw the reader into the war, while remaining easy for the layman to understand."
2,"Least Favorite ""Don't Know Much About"" Series","I purchased this book to help me learn world geography, but I must confess, the book is a big disappointment. I was expecting maps and diagrams that show geological features and explain them. There are a few maps in this book, but certainly not enough, and the ones he uses are really not that instructive or informative. His typical format of stating questions and answer the questions just does not work real well in this instance. The topics he wrote about were interesting, but learning how it all fits together (what I wanted) is not in this book. For those interested in learning geography from maps and drawings, I suggest reading this book:The Complete Idiot's Guide to Geography, 3rd Editionkone"
4,A good introduction to Geography,"Davis gives a good introduction to geography. He discusses commonly misunderstood topics concerning several aspects of the subject, such as physical science, physical geography, etc. I would recommend this book to anyone taking a basic geography class, as it provides a decent knowledge base to build upon."
3,"Decent, but preachy","As someone who loves geography, I was hoping this would be as in-depth asDon't Know Much About Mythology. I was hoping to learn more about places like the Caspian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, Great Rift Valley, the Andes, etc. While I did learn some about those types of things, much of the book deals with preaching about the dangers of global warming, and how we're cutting down the rain forest blah blah blah... Maybe this was interesting or cutting edge stuff back when the version I got my hands on was published - 1991. But in 2012, it's not; it's trite and boring. Without a doubt my favorite part of the book was the section talking about each of the 50 states."
3,"You don't? Well, you can....","Think geography is just where things go on a map? Read this book and let Kenneth C. Davis disabuse you of such ideas. Napoleon, volcanoes, Vikings, and killer meteorites are only a few of the topics Davis gives a solid going over.One minor complaint: the amount of finger-wagging at the United States and Europe, as compard to that directed at everyone else in the world, is a bit excessive. But, overall, Davis is reasonably fair."
3,"Good style, fair facts","Designed as a friendly supplement to an adult American's geographical knowledge ~ which can be amazingly incomplete ~ this is a fair success in its aim, in that it assumes very little other than interest on the part of the reader and in the tone, which is never condescending (Davis is probably a graduate of the American public school system and knows what his audience has had to cope with). For my part, i did not learn a whole lot i'd never known before, though i was reminded of some facts, but then i am not a member of Davis's target audience. It is a measure of the book's success with me as well, though, that i was sorry to arrive at the appendices and, thus, the end. I shall search out, at some point, Davis's other listed book, ""Don't Know Much About History"" and see if that is as simple and satisfying a read. I'll probably learn there, too, since it is about American history."
4,This is Fun Fiction,"Why do I call it fun? It's a rollicking good read, chock full of interesting mini-essays. A good bed-time read, easy to pick up and put down when necessary. The index goes from Abreu to zircon, with lots of stuff in the middle.Why do I call it fiction? In the cat mysteries I write, I made up an entire county in northeast Georgia, but it never occurs to anyone (I think???) to assume they could find it on a map. Just so Davis gives us an exercise in critical thinking -- as in, I'm thinking that a meter is longer than a yard, and certainly longer than a foot. Wonder why he (or an editor) didn't catch that?So, let the buyer beware -- read it, enjoy it, but be careful."
2,Don't know much about Davis,"The moment I saw this book in our local bookstore, I quickly grabbed it. The title is very eye-catching since I'm very interested about the sciences, and Geography is one fascinating subject. The book is written in simple terms and easy to understand. What I didn't like about the book is that it's explicitly very biased against the creation theory. On the earlier pages, the author clearly stated that science is dynamic which I or presumably anyone will understand that when it comes to the sciences nothing is certain. Yet the author appears to be preaching the THEORY of evolution as a fact. I thought books like this calls for unbiased and unpartial content. So I scanned the back pages looking for his credentials. And I found my evidence, ""don't know much about Davis""."
2,Authour does not know much about geography,"Superficial, trendy, politically correct, and shallow.Presents many theories and personal opinions as fact. Misrepresents views of the scientific community regarding the issue of global warming.For a book about geography, contains far fewer maps than would be expected."
4,Interesting and Entertaining,"Mr. Davis has done a top-notch job of disseminating some very useful and needful information. Don't let the title fool you - more than just ""geography"" is covered here. You'll learn history, ecology, astronomy, and more. The only caveat, and it's not a huge one, is that he occasionally gets a bit preachy, especially about the environment and his liberal attitude comes through loud and clear. Overall, a good read and well worth the price."
4,It can be embarrassing...,"I must admit that it can be bit embarrassing how little I knew about geography. Davis pulls everything together with facts of old and new. This book forced me to pull out the some maps a few times, which expanded my understanding. He answeres the questions I had always wondered (and a few that I should have already known),an easy and intersting read. Reasonably priced."
5,Excellent product and company,I broke the sprocket on my LaJolla single speed bike and this company had the exact part I needed at an excellent price. The sprocket was shipped quickly and I received it well before the expected delivery date. I will definitely be using them in the future for my bicycle parts.
4,The Master's Indwelling,Throughly enjoyed reading this book by Andrew Murray. Its one of his best on the Holy Spirit and I would recommend it to anyone.
2,good book badly formatted,"I used to have a hard copy of this and the book is superb. However, this is not formatted for the Kindle. The paragraphs do not reflow properly, making it extremely difficult to read.You would be better advised getting the text yourself and putting it in a Word document and emailing it to your kindle.If publishers cannot be bothered to format documents properly, they shouldn't be trying to sell them on Amazon."
4,"Andrew Murray, yes; Presentation, no","Anything Andrew Murray writes is excellent and five-star. However, recently, publishers have begun to scan and print without proofing. The result is missing words and letters, no proper paragraphs, or chapters, etc. The proposed intent is a more economical book, but this paperback was almost $15.00 and poorly done. Some of the Andrew Murray books (although not this one) have been rewritten into a presumably more readable text, but the fire that defines Andrew Murray is greatly lost. They are also renamed so that you can't tell if you have already purchased the original version. I like to know these things before I buy and these things aren't being presented outright nor is the publisher's page declaring the true facts being made available before purchase. Again, Andrew Murray is well worth reading, but if you are particular about these things research carefully."
4,Stirring,"This book was an excellent read. For me, it reminds me of written text of an old time gospel preacher. Murray preaches scipture with real life application. All in all he brings to life the text of the Bible and inspires the believer using the Gospel itself."
2,Narrow View of Subject,"The author here only uses one or two biblical verses that do not even especifically address the subject and bases the whole booklet on those verses. Although I am not in the defense of current pop psychology, there is research to the fact that there is much more psychological damage on totally restraining normal sexual impulses in healthy adults. But even more than that, the writers' view is what has forced many christians into totally unfruitful marriages, so they would not commit the ""sin"" of masturbation. When the Apostle Paul was referring to being burn, he was talking about men having relationships with prostitutes, not masturbation. If you want to get relevant information about the subject don't buy this book."
4,good for the price,"I like my food really spicy and I was sick of always using up the little red pepper containers I got from the grocery store (and how expensive is that??) so I bought this. It's not super spicy if used right out of the canister and cold, but I almost always run it through a spice grinder because I've found that releases the oils better (in not just this brand but in all red pepper). Also, if you put it on/in something you're cooking, the heat will bring the oils out better and spice it up as well. I wouldn't recommend this product if you're not going to use it fairly fast - I think it'll probably start to lose its flavor and potency after about 6 months."
5,Very tasty,"As advertised, what more can I say. Tasty and fresh, a pleasure to use in cooking. Would buy again the future."
2,partially defective,"Delivered as promised but snap on belt loop has 1 of 2 snaps defective, it's a great case for my LG Voyager cell/pda otherwise it gets 5 stars"
5,Great Case,"For those in the construction, public safety, etc area or even just an outdoor enthusiast, this is the case for you. Very durable and great for your smartphone."
4,Decent italian stuff,"First of all...the track listing is completely wrong! I dunt know which artist's song they stuck on that page! Main point, This is a pretty good CD. I liked all of the songs and i believe that's what it takes for an album to be considered great. I bought it last year when i was in italy 'n it sure was very popular there, since i heard it everywhere i went, and that's the reason i bought it. Because a song got stuck in my head n i decided that i had to buy it or i'd regret it for ever!o, and one last thing....CDs in italy are so goddam expensive! So dunt think it's expensive here at amazon, hehe!"
4,Slightly Stoopid is amazing!,"I picked this CD up because I love Sublime. I actually discoverd a band that I love just as much through this CD Slightly Stoopid. Long Beach Dub is cool to, but whenever I throw this disc in I immediately fast forward to Slightly Stoopid songs ""Mexico"" and ""False Rythms"" I actuallyu bought their two full length CD's which are now my two favorites."
3,Okay,The fit was a little weird on my 12 year old son (even though he wears an adult sm/med)- but he used them anyways and they were of good quality.
4,Zona Jones does not disappoint.,"I have been a fan of Zona Jones ever since 1995, when I first heard him sing. To correct the above review.... Zona has been playing in local bars for years, but in Beaumont, Texas.... not Nashville, TN.I am very impressed with his new CD and his original song ""Two Hearts"" is my absolute favorite. Zona reminds me of how country music use to be and how it should be."
1,flexall,the company mailed me that the product for the price stated was not in stock would I settle for the regular strength. I agreed but the price remained the same. disappointed.
4,good but almost too good.,This cream shouldnt be bought as massage oil or lotion- only as a bengay / icyhot replacement! It was good as a pain reliever not as a massage oil.
5,"A ""Must"" for Swedish Genealogy Researchers","""Swedish Exodus"" is an indespensible reference for Swedish researchers. In these pages one can find out why so many Swedes decided to come to America, how they mananged it, where they emigrated to in America, how many came during each year of the mass migration, how many remigrated each year, how many came from each major Swedish district, and how they did in America. It even outlines the consequences of the emigration on Sweden. It is nicely indexed, contains a useful bibliography, and is illustrated with photos and drawings."
3,The right venue for Lou Reed,Reading Lou Reed's lyrics is a lot more interesting than hearing him sing them. If only he'd lived at the same time as Hart Crane...he coulda been a contenda!
1,Dissapointing,I expected a glorious book full of quality and class but instead it's cheaply made and hard to read. When you open the book the pages literally fall out and paper quality is low. Was there NO publisher out there willing to give this artist a GREAT QUALITY PRODUCT WITH DECENT PAPER?
5,Thru the Fire with Sweet Lou,"Hardbound lyrics from a hard-edged man. Some of the lyric-stories felt so intensely personal, it seemed almost as though I were trespassing on a personal experience. How brave and bold he is. Others were so visceral and raw, they were a challenge to read. (A challenge you should meet.) This book requires a lot of time and attention and it is so worthwhile. Thank you, Mr. Reed."
4,Youth Helmet,"I ordered two helmets for my grandchildren for Christmas. They looked well made and were colorful and modern.However my grandchildren preferred another style and did not like this particular style.I suppose it is a matter of what their friends are currently wearing that makes the difference to them, as these were nice looking helmets.I have shipped them back and asked for a refund.Gramma"
5,ANOTHER KEEPER,"I have just finished Lady Polly and have thoroughly enjoyed it -- the dastard, Ditton was the only weak character in it but maybe I like a little mayhem ------- Lady Bolt was not too active but still caused trouble ----- Lord Henry finally got to declare himself - he ended up with more reputation than fact! grin - but that makes for an interesting character -- Lady Polly pulled all of the characters together -- I am looking forward to future Cornick books."
5,A MUST READ,Could not put this book down! This is the best book I've read in a long time. I'm going to be following these new authors.
3,pretty good,This was a pretty interesting book. Especially reading about what are now recognized medical conditions. Couldn't beat the price for it!
2,Boring.....,"The first story titled ""Voices"" was good but the rest was very boring. I only got through barely half of the second story and a few pages into the third story."
4,Good buy!,"I bought this for my 4 year old twin boys and they just love it! The only problem I had was the description stated that the helmet opens to reveal the Ranger's face and the helmet DOES NOT open. Still, my boys really like the different sayings and just the fact that it is a Power Ranger!!"
2,notice wrong specificity definition in biostatistics chapter 4,"I read chapter 4 biostatistics first, and noticed a serious error in the definition of specificity on page 43. Specificity should be D/(B+D), not B/(B+D).Chapter 4 is not well organized, and comprehensive enough.I am disappointed since this is already the 5th edition."
1,Get out of the way of this book,"I read the first few chapters looking for substance and concise directions and instructions.....found none there or in most of the book. The useful portion of this book could have been condensed to 3 pages of bullet points. Did find alot of quotes from other people and the same tired motivational cliche's found in 100's of books and tapes....sorry I wasted my money,"
5,Like Listening To An Old Friend Tell A Story.,"Most talented comic I've seen since George Carlin. His boyish charm and blunt honesty about life is almost overwhelming. He takes the art of storytelling to the next level. After watching this guy no one else seems funny anymore.HE IS THE BEST! Don't panic.. He exploits women, religion, sex, etc. But he does it with such grace and humility you can't be offended by him."
5,Hilarious!,"I was told about this stand up by a friend, and he hyped it in such a way, so I told myself I'd buy it, and if I didn't like it, I'd give it to him for Christmas... HECK NO! THIS DVD IS MINE!!! It's pretty raw dark humor, just my style!"
4,"Very crude, very funny","4.2 starsJefferies has definitely listened to plenty of Bill Hicks' religious material, but adds his own gleefully misogynistic take on things while drinking four pints of lager as the show progresses. All in the name of a good time, mind you, though Jim confesses that he's always hated life and found it dull and pointless. Good start for a comedian!He seems to have a pretty good time though, even when discussing his lack of endowment down under. His Aussie roots are clear enough from his bashing of the Sheila sub-species, but he's likeable enough to not offend.He drops the f's constantly, so beware, and if you're easily offended, this will easily offend. But it's worth watching for any fans of honest comedy and uninhibited wrath at all and sundry. There's plenty of truth here, however uncomfortable, and that's always a good thing."
5,FUNNY!!!,Saw Jim Jefferies on television and just had to order the DVD. Hilarious! Definitely worth seeing.
5,Great CD,"As an Idol contestant, Kelli was adorable but a little rough around the edges. She has really polished her music."
5,kelly,"kelly pckler was my #1 pick to win idol.from her very first apperance on the show.mcphee and kelly were supposed to be the 2 finalists with kelly the winner.taylor was to be third.i don't know why mcphee did not go all country.i think if she would,she would be doing a lot better.but kelly realy blew me away on the music award show.my eyes also teared up."
4,Beautifully done,"The songs that are not played on the radio are great, a few could stand to get aired. Kelly Pickler's voice and delivery is one that fills my body with goosebumps."
4,Good debut album,"Kellie is off to a good start with her recording career. The album is very personal, as several of the songs are about her life experiences. The song ""I Wonder"" deals with her mother's abandonment of the family, and is really touching. ""I'm On my Way"" is a very inspirational song, being about how life's obstacles can be overcome, as Kellie has shown by what she has achieved in such a short time. The entire album is very entertaining, and I would not say there is any filler material on it. Well done Miss Pickler!"
5,Home Run!,"Kellie really knocked it out of the ball park with this first CD. I can't believe so many songs appear to be written by her and about her life--and not remakes of other popular songs. They sound great the first time you hear them. But, they grow on you even more each time you play them. Small Town Girl has made it big time. I can't wait for more. Keep'em comin' Kellie!"
1,Tired,"This is a good example of what ""country"" music has sunk to - pop/rock with a slide guitar. Ms. Pickler is no better, and no worse, than dozens of other wannabees who seem to think a whine qualifies them as a country singer. As far as the material goes, well, it matches the artist in quality and authenticity.An almost unqualified mess - with decent sound."
2,less than i expected.,"I thought that many of the songs were disappointing. I really expected better from what I had seen of her on ""Idol."""
1,A FORGETTABLE EFFORT,"Nice try Kellie,but this cd is full of weak material and does not do your vocal ability justice....Next time you go back in the studio choose your material and have a say in the production.The last thing you want to do is model yourself as a young Dolly Parton!!!!"
3,Good artist but short on songs.,This a good sounding country music album but seems short on songs. Amount of music is similar in length to the 33 1/2 LP's of the past. I was disappointed in the value for the money.
4,Better thank expected,"I really liked Kellie on Idol, so expected to enjoy maybe a song or two on this album. Her voice comes across surprisingly unique; different enough from anyone else currently singing country music. Most of this album's songs were worth repeated listening too and several were great. Bottom line ~ well worth the money. Go Kellie!"
4,Who Needs Calamari???,"Wow! I listened to this CD to see which direction ""the powers that be"" would send Ms. Pickler. I was very pleasantly surprised. Most of the songs were written for her with lyrics such as ""I'd rather have a cheeseburger than calamari"" on ""Small Town Girl"", but this CD is certainly in Kellie's wheelhouse. She is a cross between Gretchen Wilson's sassiness and LeAnne Womack's soulfulness. Excellent CD, especially for a debut CD. Hands down better than Taylor Hick's debut CD. I hope the label decides to release ""I Wonder"", by far the best song on the project, and the song ""Small Town Girl"" should secure her position in country music. Not a Carrie Underwood clone...but simply a small town girl."
4,Amazing album..,"This cd has been the most played CD in my collection since I got it. It has its balance of upbeat country and ballads, its the perfect mixture. Before I bought the cd I didn't really pay all that much attention to her, I knew of her and thought she had talent but thats as far as it went. But she has gained a new fan with this cd."
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,Kellie really did a great job with her CD...I was impressed!She really showed her great vocals....a much more mature sound than on AI.
4,Small Town Girl,"This deserves to go all the way to the top.Small town Girl with a""big heart"" and all her own compositions are great."
4,Better than Carrie Underwood!,Kellie has the perfect country music voice. I think she is much better than Carrie who won. She just has a more unique sound!
4,kellie please read this,I am a huge fan of yours. I think you are amazing. You are not just a pretty face. I think the song red high heels is amazing. That is why her cd is amazing.
2,Not what was expected from Pickler,"I loved Kelly Pickler on American Idol. Her sheltered,innocent and good hearted nature allowed the viewer to warm to a girl who has a big country music career ahead of her, and because of this i couldnt wait for Pickler's first album to be released.What a disappointment! The album is bland verging on boring and doesnt show Pickler's voice range to the max. The album is very unadventurous and young Kelly needs to get a better range of songwriters for album two.I'll not be giving up on Kelly's country career but i've already given up on this album."
1,Painful!,"A couple of the songs are not bad, but the voice is shrill and whiney. It's a good thing I listened to the whole album online before purchasing. I'll save my money for other American Idol cd's coming out soon. It's too bad, because I love Kellie's personality, but not her voice."
1,Red Hot,This product was red hot and was totally awesome to hear in country music. Please let me know when she will release another album. Thanks.Donald Woodson
1,Sheesh!,"More offerings from an American Idol loser. AI is like the scourge of the music industry. Modern country annoys me, it is even worse when sung by a game show contestant."
4,Kellie Comes Through,"Almost all the song on this CD are great. Most are sure to be Top 40 Hits, and all are good listening. The music and lyrics are easy to listen to and appropriate for all ages. My 10 year-old daughter has not stopped listening to it all month."
4,Amazingly Wonderful,"Aah, Kellie Pickler obviously didn't need American Idol to be a big star...my favorite songs are: Red High Heels / I Wonder / Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You and Gotta Keep Moving, I also love her rendition of Walkin' After Midnight from American Idol 5: Encores."
5,Kelly Pickler,"I love her CD. I find it a very touching, personel and very well preformed. I like it more each time I listen to it."
5,Great CD,"Kellie really made the best 1st cd that she could have. She really tells her life story on this collection of songs. It's Just Kellie Being ""REAL"" and ""TRUE"" to herself. She has just the right mix of upbeat and ballads. My favs are ""Red High Heels"", ""Small Town Girl"", ""Didnt You Know How Much I Loved You"", ""Gotta Keep Moving"", ""Im On My Way"" and ""I Wonder"", any of those songs would have a good chance at radio. GOOD LUCK KELLIE! Keep It Real!"
5,Small Town Girl is Awesome!,"I couldn't wait to buy this album on October 31, and since I have listened to it almost continuously. I am not really a country music fan, but I started listening to Kellie on AI, and her innocence, wonderful personality, and voice has definitely earned my respect and admiration. If you haven't bought this album, I would definitely recommend it. It's AWESOME!"
5,this cd is worth buying !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"kellie has made a awesome record. the songs are incredible. i love every song on this record but one, i cannot tell you the last time i purchased a cd with this many GREAT songs. My favorites are Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You, I Wonder, Red High Heels, Small Town Girl and Wild Ponies"
5,Sure to enchant & intrigue,"Fine watercolour & pencil detail, illuminated snowy landscapes and delightfully drawn bears embellish the pages of this endearing storybook.Simply worded for pre-schoolers to relate to, the three bears play a pretend game with their mommy bear which will delight and enchant the young reader.Divine illustrations and realistically styled bears from mother to the three children go zooming through the snow, play at snowballs, and climb wonderful pine trees before returning to the warm log cabin and hot fire for delicious toast.The repetition within the text, and warmly human actions of the bears is sure to enchant & intrigue, whilst the chore of bedtime stories is lessened for you the reader by the pleasurable sweetness of the illustrations.A great favorite.kotori ojadis@yahoo.com"
3,missing something...,"After the positive progression that resulted in ""Poltergeist"" I had high expectations for this album, and so far I'm feeling like something is lacking here. Out of the 18 tracks there are only a few that Eligh actually has flows on, and a majority of the instrumentals don't seem to go anywhere. However, I did just get this today, so I haven't fully absorbed it. And it is definately better than the majority of the crap that comes out these days. I'm curious to see what other heads have to say..."
5,Enigma,"this album is great. the thing i liked most about this album are the instrumentals. theres a lot of them -not too many, and theyre all spectacular. do yourself a favor and download it from some site for free or somthing. if you dont know how to do that then buy it. you wont regret it. its definently worth the great price amazon.com has it for (...)"
3,Too much hype for Eligh,"Eligh, a producer and emcee for the Living Legends busted out his own CD in early 2005. Although this was thought to be the coming out of Eligh, it fell well short of what i thought it would be. Only about half of his songs have him singing or rapping, and the other ones are just instramentals. The last song is the highlight of this CD and who ever doesnt feel this song, has no love for the UNDAGROUND.Top Trax: #7 Dali Lama Lullaby, #8 Who Else,#17 New Eyes, #18 Desperation (feat Murs and Scarub)"
4,The lyrical joyful!,"Anton Rubinstein' s piano music has been overshadowed by the legend of the performer. His thundering pianism and well known qualities as admirable soloist have created a barrier around just a few have been able to surpass it.Among his Piano Concertos, the best known is the fourth Op. 70, but his piano compositions are almost neglected for most of pianists. His works for piano are not precisely originals, they accuse the influence of Liszt, Mendelssohn and Schumann, and although we may realize there is an excessive use of superfluous material, there are certain virtues around them.Leslie Howard made a colossal effort to bring us the entire set of Piano Sonatas. And for all the music lovers, these piano pieces should be included among their invaluable collection.The Fourth Sonata is by far, the best achievement."
2,stiff stiff stiff,"These sheets are super cute, but so stiff and not soft at all. My 3 year old son told me he didn't want to sleep on them anymore because they were ""too noisy and hard"". I washed them a few times and it got minimally better. The company was very understanding, but I would not recommend these particular sheets at all. I have gotten other sheets from olive kids that were great, maybe this was a bad batch or something but it was too stiff."
3,Looks great but....,The elastic in the fitted sheet is no longer elastic! They must have used cheap elastic for these very expensive sheets..I am disappointed it didn't last longer..but is it cute? Totally! I will just have to re-sew new elastic in it myself...:(
1,Not great for the amount of money I spent,"What a disappointment! For the amount of money I spent on this bedding set, it was soo not worth it! The bedding doesn't fit by son's toddler bed very well - it works, but ends up pretty short on the sides. The worst of it is the material. I would think toddler bedding would be nice, soft and snuggly, but this is not that. It is hard and scratchy and the comforter is so stiff! If I must say one positive, my son likes the outer space pictures on it."
4,Great tool,"First of all, the reason this review did not receive a 5 is because the driver did not download properly with Samsung PC Studio ver. 3.0 CD and I was required to visit the Samsung website to download ver. 3.1 of the software. Once that was done, everything worked perfectly. I haven't used all the tools available, but the simplicity of transferring files is excellent. The tools available are as follows: Manage Contacts and more, Manage Messages, Synchronize, Transfer Files, Manage Internet Connections, Compose Multimedia Messages, Manage Multimedia Files and Play Multimedia files. At this point, I've only experimented with managing multimedia files, but I've been able to create some cool wallpapers and ring tones using my favorite CD's as it has a photo editor and sound editor. All I need is a memory card for my phone and when I experiment with this further, maybe I'll come back and write another review."
5,Just great Domino,The music is just great. Musicians are having fun. Nothing like a live performance. If you like Fats Domino you will love this.
3,Okay DVD,"This DVD was okay, but not like other performances of Fats Domino I have seen in he past. Will look for other DVDs by Fats."
1,missing the good stuff !,"THE GOOD OLD SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY ACT AT THE END OF HIS SHOWS AND,THE INTERACTION WITH THE AUDIENCE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OFTHIS CONCERT ! I FEEL CHEATED."
2,Disturbing book,"I read Sleeping With Soldiers by Rosemary Daniell and found it disturbing. Like alcoholism or drug abuse, migratory sexuality is a true compulsive disorder and Daniell describes what a life of compulsive sexuality is really like. Rosemary drank too much, tried drugs and engaged in a lot of zipless sex as well as changing husbands. She had 3 husbands and 3 children and a live in lover with whom she became pregnant and had an abortion. The book is hard to describe. I seems to be a collection of previously published articles and not a consistent voice. Sometimes it captures the voice of people's speech patterns, other times it seems to brag about her ability to have sex easily obtained and often that would make the reader envious. Her ability to pick up men was the thrill of victory that became the agony of defeat after a while. She claims to have been a cheer leader in high school and the one with the most dates in the history of the school. Really that popular."
1,What a Shame.,"I've always had good luck with Verbatim, and hopefully this is just a fluke, but it appears that Verbatim has gone the way of the overwhelming number of companies that don't care what kind of garbage they foist off on their customers. Every disc in this bunch was faulty. I got, at most, one recording out of each one. Now I don't know where to turn. Maybe I'll throw my DVD player away and go back to reading books."
1,Incompatible with Mac OS X,These discs do not appear to work on machines running Mac OS X. Please post otherwise if you find they work on your machine. I'm using a MacBook.
2,two out of ten discs OK?,"Two out of ten of these discs may have functioned correctly. The other eight had sporatic disc error 0x80070571 disc structure is corrupt orunreadable. Erase, diagnostic scans showed multible errors. Returned to Amazon for refund, only bright note was ease of discs return, wonderful process used by Amazon. Will try another brand."
4,Re-recording fine,I have two exact JVC dvd recorders. I can't get anything to work in one (even JVC discs) and these discs are currently working in the other. I don't understand why when you get beyond 4 hours the discs seize up.
2,First disk a dud.,"All the others seemed to record ok (although I have only watched a handful so far). I know the defective disk should be covered under warranty, but to start the process for 1 disk is too much. I will buy a different brand next time."
1,bad discs,"would not format in my Philips DVR, despite the fact that the DVR manual listed them as compatible.Went to BestBuy & got Sony +RW & Verbatim +R which work fine, so the problem is not my DVR."
4,Ad advertised!,So far the DVD has operated as advertised with no glitches. I am pleased with the packaging and the performance. The price is great for the quality of the product.
3,Have not opened them yet.,I am hoping I purchased what I need. I do not understand the 4X. I still have a couple other dvd-rw to use before I open these.
5,Verbatim rules when it comes to Data backup,I am going to start this way and tell you that i think Verbatim is the best DVD-Rom makers on the planet. The product states that all of the discs are stable rewriting performance for up to 1000 times. To clear that up that means that it can be wrote on and then erased for over 1000 times and it will still perform and no data lost. If you are storing some pretty important data you need this item. It has what Verbatin calls SERL. What this is is a special laying on the disc which only this unit type has and it is the best i have ever used in my life of copying data and pics to a CD. I have not had a coasters with anyone of this disc that i depend with my important data. One more thing it comes with a thick cassete to hold the DVD's not the thin ones. Even more protections.
3,good product,"What makes this product good is that it each DVD has its own jewel case. Not stuck on a spindle, which will wear or ruin the recorded data. Another good thing is your can rewrite over or update old data without having to throw away the whole DVD."
4,Very compatible with my Magnavox DVD recorder,I love the output at EP speed for 4 hours of recording. I would love 6 hours of recording but it seems my DVD recorder doesn't have enough of the best features to render a clear and precise finished product. I find this brand of DVD+RWs are super nice and very productive for my needs.
3,verbatim dvd,"Recently purchased a Magnavox DVD recorder to replace VCR for daily programmed recordings. After trying several different mfg. (with poor results), tried Verbatim disks (recommended by Magnavox customer service). Same poor results... Could find no difference between disk mfg.Returned Magnavox DVDR and exchanged for Panasonic. All disks have clear recordings - regardless of manufacturer. Generic disks work as well as Verbatim and Sony. I have found that quality of recordings are determined by the recorder - not the disk.As for product purchase experience through Amazon...excellent. Very quick and easy."
5,The Man From Yesterday,I was pulled in from the first page and it kept getting stronger. It flows good and has a great story line plus strong Characters. I think this Novel is destined to become a Best Seller.Jean PremeauAuthor of Station In Life.
1,Tedious and boring,This book has the right idea--write a book about urban legends and explain how they came about. It's too bad that they blow it completely! They give you the original urban legend--and then EVERY variation of it. It gets boring very quickly. Even worse is that the author recreates it in EXACTLY the words it was spoken or written. That's comendable but the writing styles are all over the place! Some work as they are--others are next to impossible to read. Even worse is that thr authors explanations of legends and their origins are very VERY dry and dull. Not recommended.
4,I LIKE IT!,"I LOVE THESE BOOKS! THE URBAN LEGENDS GET ME SO GOOD. THESE ARE STORIES THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD, UNLIKE MOCT URBAN LEGENDS BOOKS. I DEEPLY SUGGEST THIS BOOK."
4,3 thumbs up,"this book is very cool. fun to read so you won't get bored. and you find out where some of the urban legends originated too, which will make you an interesting conversationalist at any party."
4,good cheap rain slicker!,"this long black nylon button up rain slicker with lining is cheap, packable, and looks good. fit is true to size and quality is better than i expected. this is a great raincoat and of course keeps the rain off very well."
3,Good price,"Couldn't find this at a better price and it shipped quickly, The only bad thing is the liner in the right arm is sewn in all twisted. So are going to have to pull threads and do some resewing so it can be worn."
3,Good reference book,"If you are interested in the theology of the early Christian church, this is a great reference. It provides an excellent overview of many topics, including a description of the writings and of various subjects of the writings."
3,to short,This book was a bunch of short articles that were of little value to the research I was conducting. I would not recommend this if you was to learn and understand the subjects found in this book
1,So Boring,"This book was on my summer reading list. I read the first few chapters and have concluded that all this book does it Critisize the ETS and the SATs. We all know everyone hates the SATS and they are not fair but why do i need to hear two more people (the authors) whine and moan about something no one can help. I could really care less about some of the issues discussed in the first few chapters such as where the money the ETS makes goes. Again, i really dont need to read other peoples opinions about the SATs. I thought this book would be factual rather then critical."
5,Just as advertised,Love this blanket... I've had it for over a month and washed it twice so far.. it's holding up well... it's very soft feeling... I bought the purple which was true to the picture. I use it for yoga but also as an added cover on cold nights. I love the extra large size. Overall very pleased with purchase.
4,Ginormous!,"This blanket is ginormous, but also super soft in texture and of good quality. The plusses to having a bigger blanket are that you can create larger bolsters for certain poses you might want help with or to support areas of your body that need supporting. It is also nice that it is bigger because when folded into a smaller square it acts as a pillow for sitting on during yoga nidra practice. So, the minuses of having a ginormous blanket ?... lugging the thing around, obviously, but if you don't mind that part I totally recommend this blanket for its versatility and quality."
5,Stories Are Short,"I like this anthology because the stories are short, so if you are lazy reader or are busy, we could read one or two episodes and put it down, save for later. All the Star Trek Readers stories are like this, because I guess one hour episodes in print aren't that long. I remember all the TV episodes, so reading them I already knew the ending. And they are more for reliving the episodes, than wanting to read new stories."
1,Not as advertised,"This ball is not a size 3 soccer ball. It is about the size of a large grapefruit. Also, my daughter wanted something she could kick around the house without breaking things - even though this ball is full of rags, it is still extremely hard and in my opinion my suitable for indoor use."
1,Zeus Juice,"The way that I view this book is that it is not really intersting. I was looking for something that ahd more to do with Egyptians. It had more to do with juice. I really think that tis publisher needs to get her license checked to be a writer but hey thats only my opinion. Bye, Bye. Anyway I really don't think that this is important but you see I got this report and it gotta be done by friday the 26th. Well I dont wanna run up your time so I'll be seeing ya.TiaraLovelifewitPooh"
5,One Night for an Hour!,"Stonehill is a master musician/performer! I've search for years for this video and finally found it. Though it's a VHS, I am transferring it to DVD! Excellent show and well worth the wait!"
2,Stopped working after two weeks,"Don't know what is wrong, but the unit stopped working after about two weeks. When first installed, it worked fine, a little loud; but it worked as advertised. Should have spent the extra $10 for the factory one."
4,Pushing all the right buttons!,"In the interest of full disclosure - I haven't even heard this 3-disc compilation. My father-in-law visted from Panama and the only language he and I could speak was ""Rat Pack."" Apparently, there's a dearth of this high-quality music in Panama and I was dying to find a quality compilation to send his way. This was it! It took every thing in me not to open it and ""listen"" to it myself. But I did do the right thing and sent it sealed and fresh straight to Panama City, Panama. What a good son-in-law am I! I plan on ordering my own copy, of course."
5,BUY THIS BOOK!!,"This book is inspirational! You will want it in your library. It is for anyone who has doubts about accomplishing a goal or is questioning his or her personal growth. It is about taking risks and being triumphant. The transformation this couple makes to the landscape and their souls, after a year of building a house in the country, is poignant. You will want to know Henderson and Lucy. The symbolsim is right there. Your English teacher will not have to spell it out for you! You will laugh and cry. TAKE YOUR BLINDERS OFF AND JUST READ IT!"
3,Easy Heat RS-2 Automatic Roof De-Icing Cable Control,The Easy Heat RS-2 Automatic Roof De-Icing Cable Control system is easy to install and comes with easy to follow instructions. 2 months into owning the device I have not seen it turn on once however I still dont have any ice dams either.
1,Easy Heat RS2 Controller,"I had an electrician install exterior wiring on a new 20 amp breaker, then I installed the easy heat deicing cables myself and have had no problem. But the controller has not worked at all. I saw a previous review say it only works in the presence of water and all I have is snow. That sounds odd but it doesn't work."
1,Not worth it!,Absolutely the most worthless product out there. Why? Because immediately after installation the product stopped working and froze onto the roof. Don't waste your money on this junk!
1,Easy Heat RS-2 Auto Roof De Icing Cable Control,Haven't been able to get this product to work. Followed the instructions but had no success. Therefore not very impressed.
5,Great book,"What an exciting and creative designer......her designs are resonant with color, and are based on simple motifs - stripes, circles, leaves, and tiger strips - which can be used to create bold, graphic effects as well as more ornate designs. The book has templates and step by step instructions, which clearly show how to transfer these to a variety of plain surfaces using only the most basic materials. Projects will appeal to both the homemaker and artist. Projects range from a deck chair with tiger strips to a dotty lampshade and base, chequered table top and jewellelry boxes, decorative plates, etc."
3,Oh want a tangled web we weave,"Gwen Mayfield (Joan Fontaine) fresh from an encounter with a witch doctor is given an opportunity to recover and a position in a private school in England. There she finds something sis a miss and the discovery of a voodoo doll confirms she is up against someone's wicked ways. As usual everyone is suspect and it is always the last person you suspect. Oh all alright the last person you are supposed to suspect. Will she figure it out in time or will evil have its wicked way. She may even be the target.The only two things that give the film any credence is Joan Fontaine and that it is a Hammer production. Hammer cannot go wrong in many eyes. The butcher (Duncan Lamont) can be seen again in ""5 Million Miles to Earth"" (1967).The DVD I watched looks like a direct VHS transfer and not Blu-ray. There is an extra - World of Jammer ""Wicked Women"". A U.S Theatrical Trailer ""The Devil's Own"" and TV SpotsI have to admit that I had a hard time keeping my finger off the fast forward."
4,Joan Fontaine in a superb performance,"A classic Hammer chiller, THE WITCHES, which is also known as THE DEVIL'S OWN, is an engrossing story of the occult set in the seeemingly harmless English countryside.Haunted by the terrors she saw in Africa, schoolteacher Gwen Mayfield (Joan Fontaine) accepts a teaching position in a local Haddaby School run by Alex Bax (Alec McCowan) and his sister Stephanie (Kay Walsh).Soon, however, as mysterious occurances start, such as a boy falling into a coma, a headless doll found impaled with pins, Gwen starts re-living her African nightmare again.Very good story, although the climactic witch-coven scene draws more laughs than gasps, with the Witch Queen looking like a cross between Edina from AB FAB and Bullwinkle the Moose.In deluxe widescreen (aspect ratio of 1.66:1), and original trailers of the film under the DEVIL'S OWN title, and paired with another Hammer film PREHISTORIC WOMEN."
4,Excellent Hammer movie without Peter Cushing,"Joan Fontaine is a teacher who was traumatized by a frightening voodoo ritual while in Africa. Years later, she accepts a job at a small private school and then strange things start to occur.The DVD is released by Anchor Bay, there is excellent color and the sound is also outstanding. Extras include the original theatrical trailer, two TV spots that advertise the film as a double feature with Prehistoric Women, and the episode ""Wicked Women"" from the World of Hammer series."
4,does not work with Vista,"Nice little package and super easy - but be warned - it does NOT work with Vista nor does their website have a patch. Nonetheless, I did the BIOS version on Vista machine and was able to backup all data, then the boot failed on the backup drive. I was able to patch it with the Vista DVD repair, but YMMV - you'll need the Vista original disk. It worked for me but it is somewhat risky. I do wish they would better disclose the Vista compatability problem."
2,Sounded good,I guess if you had a xp system it would of worked great I was upgrading vista and I could not get it to work with vista and could not find any new updates in the apricon website I am not going to put down the product all I am saying it just doe not work well with vista upgrade.
1,Unclear instructions/pictures,I couldn't figure out how to use this contraption. It's not worth the money for what you get. I just ended up with the car seat on top of the luggage.
3,Ummm...it's okay.,"This would be great if it were easier to attach/detach from your luggage. It really sucked going through security. You have to take it off, put it back on. Then it won't fit down the aisle of the plane So then you have to take it off again. It was kind of a pain in the ....! You definitely need a carry on with a locking handle. In my personal opinion It's too over priced for what you get out of it! Notice in the picture the guy isn't smiling. That'll be you!"
3,it is what it says,"It is, and does, exactly what it says- no more, no less. We used it part of the time, but sometimes it was too annoying after security."
2,difficult to attach,I did not feel that there were enough directions as to how to attach the product. I was unable to make it work. The idea sounds good.
2,Impractical and WAY overpriced,"Works fine, but be prepared to be disappointed with what gets shipped to you. I'm all for rewarding innovative products and the investment in idea and prototyping, but this is ridiculous. It probably cost less than a buck to make!Also, i should have frankly thought it thru more. The time you will actually be able to strap your kids seat to your baggage will be minimal. For me it would be the distance between the kerb and check-in, about 200yrs...not worth it frankly. After that, the seat is usually on my back like a backpack as we battle security...hey keeps the chiropractic industry going right!!!!Do yourself a favor and put your $20 to better use."
4,Very useful for airport travel,"I recently traveled alone with my 2 year old son. I knew I had to bring his car seat on the plane to keep him confined, but I wasn't sure how I was going to manage him and everything else I needed on my own. This worked very well. Two problems I ran into were 1) I had to disassemble the cart seat and suitcase every time we went through a security check and 2) you need to be sure you have a durable suitcase with strong wheels and handle to support both the car seat and your child. I would reccommend this product. Happy Traveling!"
3,Strap too small for large suitcase,"I don't recall the box stating the dimensions of the suitcase that this strap would work for, nor the maximum weight capacity. I used it on a large suitcase with my large carseat. I had a hard time strapping it down and ended up using a carabiner to extend the strap. Also since my suitcase was full and my 1 year old weighs about 30 pounds, all of the extra weight ended up twisting out my tires on my suitcase and ruining it."
2,Not quite what I thought,In concept I thought that this would be a great item to have. I was planning on traveling from Virginia to Oregon (with a layover in ATL) with a 15 month old and a 2 1/2 year old - by myself. I thought I would be able to strap the carseat to the carry on. I did not plan on having my son in the carseat while strapped to the suitcase. Once I received the strap thing I realized that there was NO way it would work on a carry on. The suitcase would have to be at a huge angle in order for the carseat to not drag on the floor. Waste of money.
1,"Penny wise, pound foolish","Sounds like a great idea, until you look at the Safety Warning: ""-We are not liable for damage to your suitcase or car seat caused by use of this product.""You're going to strap 40-50 lbs of kid and seat to a carryon with little dinky wheels and a simple tube handle? That's just asking for the handle to get bent, or the wheels to break off the bottom while your kid is riding on it. Look at the wheels on any stroller, or for that matter the Gogo Kidz Travelmate, and then look at the wheels on your carryon. They are *not* built to take that kind of weight. So you might be saving the $60 by not getting something like the Travelmate, but give it a little time and you'll probably be spending more replacing your suitcase.Bottom line: Could be real useful for carrying an empty carseat, if the suitcase isn't packed with much weight. Put a kid in it, and it'd be a good way to destroy a suitcase."
5,Very Handy!,"I was very skeptical about this even once I got it. The first time I tried it at home, I thought ""this isn't going to work"" and I decided to jam my son into the infant carrier for our flight. Now that he is without a doubt too big for that, I tried this again and it was wonderful. It really only makes sense if you use it with your carry on luggage or else you have to check your bag and you can't use it to move them through the airport. I didn't think it would work since the car seat (britax boulevard) is just a big as my rollerboard, but once we got it set up it was brilliant. Even getting through security wasn't too bad once you knew how to attach it, it was very quick. I highly recommend!!"
1,Did not work for us,"The concept is great-simple and easy. But the strap did not wrap around our suitcase-it just did not fit our Britax carseat So, we invented our own with a booster seat strap and clipped it in place-no problem. Amazon as always was great in providing a full refund."
1,Not for toddlers,"I bought this for my grandson. He is only two but this item did not work for him. His mother tried to use it to help her get through the air port. Unfortunately, she was unable to move the suitcase with the car seat attached and ended up having to carry the car seat in her hand while holding her toddler's hand and also toting a 7 mth old in a sling. They need to put in their ad that their is a weight limit so someone else does not waste their money as I did."
4,Life Saver and a Hassle all in one,"I used this to go from Okinawa, Japan to the U.S. and back again. I liked the fact this product is very affordable and works with my rolling carry. It allowed me to take my daughter's Britax Marathon stroller (which she loves) on the plane and allow her to sleep comfortably.However, the negative side to this for me was trying to get through security check point. I had to disconnect/disassemble the car seat from the carry on, take my daughter out of the car seat, then put the stroller and carry on through the X-Ray machine. And then put it all back together again on the other side. With that said, it is still a great product. I got a whole lot of people telling me how ""together"" I seemed to have everything."
5,"A stress reducer,","This was just what we needed for our trip to Jamaica. We strapped the (Graco Eddie Bauer) car seat on a 22"" carry-on and then strapped our 3 year old in and it worked like a charm. We made sure that the top tether of the latch system for the car seat was as close to the car seat as possible and didn't have any problems with it scraping the ground.We got down all those long runways with ease. I read earlier reviews and thought it might be a pain to get on and off to go through the x-ray machines but we had no problem.It gave me peace of mind knowing she was right with my luggage and she loved the ride. We didn't have to worry about lugging the car seat either. However, I think the best part was the looks and comments we got from people at the airports. It was well work the money."
4,Pretty Handy,"I have used this product twice. I used it the first time with my infant car seat. Of course my child was not inside. I planned on getting a bigger carseat for the travel back. It worked okay, considdering it was not designed for the infant carseat. It is a bit of a pain to take on and off at the security points. When we traveled with it using the Alpha Omega Elite it worked well. Took a bit to get it to really fit on the bag well, and it was a good sized carry on bag. We had a stroller as well and more or less used this to move the carseat. We did strap her in it just to check out how it works and it was fine. I think it was a good idea and a good buy since its not pricey. You can stick it in your bag and just pull it out of needed. Overall a good product."
4,Great Idea!,"This is the coolest thing ever! It's really easy to put on your carry on luggage. The only hassle, of course, is security. It's a great thing to have when I have to travel alone with the baby and just don't have enough hands to carry everything! I highly recommend it!"
2,"Great concept, but...","I'm giving this product two stars just for the concept alone. I read previous reviews here and thought this would be the solution to traveling with a toddler in an airport/airplane. Wrong! It was such a hassle having to un-strap the carseat at security, strap it back on, and then having to un-strap it again at the gate! I guess this product would be ""great"" if you're not traveling alone with your child. This contraption was such a pain to deal with. I recommend getting a sturdy carseat bag and putting the carseat in that, and using an umbrella stroller to get around the airport."
3,It's ok- it works as advertised...,"We've used this now for six flights, one of which was to Alaska. It works as advertised, but I would not advise having a toddler sit in the car seat while it is attached to the bag...it makes it heavy and very hard to pull. Other than that, it's pretty convenient and easy to use and store. However, I think that the Go Go Kidz travelmate would be better for me since we do fly a lot and sometimes we want to check all of our bags. With this accessory, we always have to ""save"" one carry-on so that we can attach the car seat to it."
1,Not worth it,"Product did not fit my carry on luggage and so it ended up being a waste of money. We had to use bungee cords instead to attach the car seat, but my son couldnt sit in it. Probably better to attach the car seat to a stroller and then gate check the stroller. The Childress stroller bag was easy to use, so that's probably what we will do next time."
3,a simple idea that works,"This is a simple piece of ""T"" shaped strap with (3) metal rings on each end. We used it with the Cosco Alpha Omega Elite car seat and it did work as described, although the car seat is larger than our roll on hand luggage, so it was a bit unstable to sit our 2 year old in it too. However, we fitted it to our large wheeled suitcase and it was fine, very stable and our 4 year old was able to ride. This is just a piece of strap, like you'd find on a rucksack, so $15 seems a bit expensive, but we didn't want to pay out $80 for the proper wheeled carrier. And in the end, it worked great, I was able to pull one large suitcase, one car seat and one 4 year old with one hand! Note, you have to really tighten your car seat straps to attach them securely. I have only given 3 stars, because if you buy this to attach to roll on hand luggage, as described by the manufacturer, you might have problems."
2,I could make something better myself.,Great idea but needs altering. I would just use a click-locking tiedown strap instead. It would go tighter than this device I actually bought. The carseat would just barely drag on the ground when connected to the carry on. I had the anchors and latch as tight as they would go but it still wasn't tight enough from keeping the carseat from touching the ground unless you had the bag tilted so much that your back was breaking from your hand almost touching the ground. My husband just ended up carrying the carseat by hand the whole time!
4,Good but could be better,I have a newer car seat and it is heavier because it is a all in one car seat. When you attached the car seat to the carry on bag it was too heavy to pull without my child in it so I ended up having to lug the car seat on the carry on bag and push a stroller in front of me. All by myself for this last trip. And my carry on bag was not strong enough for the car seat because my handles are bent from just the car seat. My suggestion is definitely pack your bag then attach the car seat at home before you leave to see if it will actually be worth the hassle. Also if you go on a small charter plane you have to detach the car seat and carry all of your stuff including your child to the seat. Not always easy or fun to do by yourself. But I do love the idea I wish it was thought out a little bit better.
4,"Helpful contraption, but $14 seems a bit steep for a nylon strap with D-rings LOL","I decided to purchase this since my 2.5 year old daughter is a SPRINTER! It was her first time flying, and I didn't want to have to chase her all over the airport, so I strapped her in her carseat and attached this strap to my carryon. It was pretty easy to maneuver it --my carryon weighed about 20-25lbs. and she weighs approx. 35lbs. I just can't believe it costs $14 for a nylon ""T"" strap! They are makin' a profit on this little thing! I only ended up using it once, and then just carried her carseat since she wanted to walk and roll the carryon. But, it DID work like it said it was supposed to, so I was happy with it! It was definitely a lifesaver (when the little escape artist was actually strapped in her carseat)!"
4,Good for flights without layovers,This product worked really well and wasn't too hard to put together even when I was traveling by myself with my daughter. The only problem was when I had to get off the plane. It was more difficult to get it together in a narrow aisle with flight attendants hurrying you. I liked how it worked and my daughter appreciated the ride but I would only use it on flights without layovers now.
4,What a great idea!,"I bought this product to carry my 15 month son at the airport. It's such a simple idea, but works great! I put my son on car seat and it was life saving for me. So many people turned their heads to see how it works. Only thing you want to be careful is to make sure not to tip over when you are putting your kid in the carseat. Because it can be bit unstable, depends on your luggage."
3,Does the job,"This strap works pretty well, although it always takes a couple of minutes to hook the carseat on correctly. One thing that's annoying is that until the carseat latch is tightened, the whole thing moves around a lot and becomes un-centered on the suitcase. Is really a 2-person job.The price can't be beat though."
2,Too Small,"Good concept and would have worked good, if it wasn't too short. Couldn't hook up the anchor straps because it wasn't long enough and this was on only a medium size suitcase. Would modify it if we didn't loose it after 10 minutes of our first use. Instead we'll me making out own versus spending another $12."
1,I really wanted to like this,"With all the rave reviews, I figured this was the product for us. Boy was I mistaken. I read most reviews and tried all the tricks, suit case was full and it never was tight enough. I have a Britax Roundabout 55 and was using a 20"" carry on bag. After several attempts, it still was not working. We ended up not bringing any car seats, rented them from the car place and worked like a charm. I do not think it would have been wise trying to push this through the airport."
4,Great product! Can be a little sturdier.,"My wife was travelling alone with our 18 month old, internationally. This product was a great blessinig, kept the kid in control through out the journey. My son liked it too, as the experience was both fun and comforable for him. When we tried to remove the buckle, one of the buckle came off, it can happen in any accessory, i wish it didnt happen, but without this product, she wouldnt have made the trip all. I would highly recommend this to anyone, who is in a similar siuation or in need."
4,Works well,"It works well, but not perfect. It works best when the suit case is full and heavy. Our car seats are huge and drag on the ground a bit but it beats carrying the things. They attach pretty quick once you have done it once or twice. I did let my son sit in once while it was attached and he rode it like a stroller. I would research other products, but this one definitely got the job done."
4,"EASY ON, EASY OFF","THIS WAS GREAT ON OUR TRIP. IT MADE MOVING THROUGH THE AIRPORT WITH THE CARSEAT EASY, ONLY DRAWBACK IS IF YOUR CHILD IS IN THE SEAT AND YOU HAVE TO GO FORWARD INSTEAD OF PULLING THE BAG THAT THE CARSEAT IS ATTACHED TO IT IS HARD MOVING OVER BUMPS BUT OVERALL VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE."
5,Great Product! Makes Traveling so simple!,"I was skeptical when this product arrived, but now I LOVE it! My daughter loved riding in her seat and it made navigating through the airport very easy. I highly recommend it!"
4,works great,"This simple little strap works great. Wish I had invented it. I'm currently ordering a second one after losing our first one mid-trip, which made the trip home much harder without it."
1,Just a strap,"This is just a strap that wraps around the piece of luggage and the carseat. I don't know any pieces of luggage that will withstand the weight of a carseat with a child in it, along with the weight of whatever is in the luggage. Not to mention the level of trust that you would have to have in this little strap in order to use it to carry your children around. This thing is just about useless."
4,Simple and Easy to Use,"Although my wife was doubtful when I purchased this, it turned out to work on both our small and medium roller bags. It made for a heavy load (of course this depends on the size of the child), but it worked as advertised."
4,Question,I would like to know if this work with the graco nautilus? it seems a little big for the strap. Can somebody share their experience?thank you
3,great idea,"The idea is great. We used this a few times on our trip and it was quite useful. It was easy to hook up and remove and my baby loved it, he enjoyed cruising around in this and it keeps him occupied when going through security. The best part is that it was very portable and you can take it anywhere you go. The only thing is that it puts a lot of strain on the carry on luggage and it doesn't feel too stable."
5,Worth every penny!,"This product is so simple and works so great. Was thinking of buying one of the go go travelmates and this saved me hundreds of dollars AND the hassle of rolling around yet another piece of luggage. With this, you just add it to your already existing carryon. Got so many questions and compliments about it. Great product, wish I would have thought of this one."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT...worked great and easy to install,"Purchased to travel through the airport on our way to NY from Seattle. It was so easy to install, you just clip onto the 3 anchor points on your car seat, around a full suitcase, and strap your kiddo in. We needed the car seat for our daughter in NY but this worked great to hold our 10 month old boy while we walked with our daughter. We used the smaller of our suitcases that would fit into the overhead bin. As a previous person said, you do need to have that bag full. We just packed our jackets and the kids blankets into it and that was perfect.Works great and well worth the tiny price."
3,Dont use your good luggage,"The strap is super easy to put on the luggage and car seat. Once you add the car seat to the luggage, the luggage becomes pretty heavy. Add the kid to the car seat, you have an extremely heavy pull. So heavy that it busted the wheels out on our luggage. So now we cannot use our fun spinner luggage. Great concept though!"
5,Love It!!!!,First time I have ever made an effort to write a review on a product....This simple strap was a lifesaver for me. I was long haul traveling with my toddler daughter and the ability to wheel her around airport terminals and providing somewhere comfy for her to sit while waiting in long Immigration and Custom lines was a godsend.Thumbs up from my daughter and I.....(p.s My friends in Australia would like you to make a strap compatible for Australian standard carseats that do not use the latch system).
3,Maybe I'm doing it wrong?,"I loved the concept of this, but it just didn't work out as well as I had hoped. It took some practice getting it hooked up so that the bottom of the car seat (Britax Marathon 70) didn't drag. Definitely would advise anyone to practice well in advance of your trip, or you'll be frustrated!!! Works well with an empty car seat, but I wouldn't put my son in it, for sure. Better to put your bags in the car seat and either walk or carry your little one - I'd be worried that it would lean too far over to the side, and with the added weight of your kid, it would easily tip over completely. Of course, if you have your kid strapped in - no biggie, but it sure would slow you down!"
2,Not Impressed,"I thought this was a great idea and was glad to find an alternative to a 200 dollar car seat stroller device. However, this was quite a disappointment. It was pretty unstable even though I tightened it as far as it would go. It also broke my suitcase. It wasn't a cheap suitcase either but it broke the wheels off anyway. I ended up having to drag my daughter and suitcase around the airport on the last leg of our 16 hour trip. I was traveling alone so it sucked big time."
4,Review of Traveling Toddler strap,"My wife and I recently traveled with our two year old twin girls. The product works exactly as advertised, with just two minor compains.1 - My wife had a really hard time balancing the weight of the toddler + car seat + suitcase. She had to push hard on the extended handle to keep it balanced which was akward. I was able to hold it a little lower which made it easier.2 - You really need a very sturdy suitcase to use with this strap. We had two suitcases; one sturdy, one a little more ""light weight"". The light suitcase's wheels struggled with the weight and the handle flexed quite a bit! The sturdy suitcase (a Kirkland business carry-on case) had no problems.Overall, we are satisfied with the product."
1,"great concept, lousy physics","We got this as well as a car seat bag with wheels. I was not going to pay $200 for a car seat/stroller combo, so we picked 2 alternatives. I was hoping that the Traveling Toddler would be great, but I found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase. To add the weight of my car seat (a Britax) and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase. It felt awkward and unstable. The physics of it just did not work. So, we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us. The bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand-by and wait and see what seats are left. There was no more window seats available on one of our flights, so we gate checked the seat and I was happy to know that it was protected."
5,Exactly what I needed,"The traveling toddler car seat accessory is a simple but genius idea! After dragging my car seat through several airports while pushing my toddler in the stroller and rolling my suitcase at the same time, I was desperate for a better alternative. I have seen other similar products that are more like at trolly and cost over $75. $75 more than I wanted to pay. When I saw this I was intrigued and loved the price. Several comments complained about the price for such a simple device, but I had neither the time or inclination to fashion my own. And for less than $20 I figured it would be worth a try. It worked perfectly! I did not put my toddler in the seat only because I didn't need to for this trip. But she walked beside me while I only had to pull ONE thing instead of 2 plus carry the car seat on my back! This was a huge lifesaver & I would recommend it to anyone."
4,It works great,Love this and that it works so great. Only complaint is how it is difficult to put on and take off repeatedly. I still use it cause it is better then nothing and easier then lugging around a stroller and carseat.
1,not stable,great idea but wiggle everywhere when I attach the car seat. Even the most strong carry on still can't make it stable enough
3,Be sure you know if you have a LATCH carseat before you buy!,"I would have to say that the idea behind this is pretty great, but our Evenflo car seat does not come with the extra straps needed to make this work. I did read the [...] site and Amazon before buying and none of the descriptions tell you what a LATCH carseat is... they just put the LATCH part in capital letters and let you guess at what that means. We are going to try to make this product work with a bungee cord because our carseat only has a top tether and not the straps that come out the sides. I am a little dissappointed that they don't explain more thoroughly what type of carseat setup you need in order for this product to work, so that is why I'm giving it a 3. Hope it works with the bungee cord."
4,Simple and easy!,"Now that we have to cart around the toddler seat, I was trying to figure out the easiest way that I could manage on my own. I was going to get the GoGo Kidz Travelmate, but found this one as well. I figured that for $15, might as well try this one out first! It works great! So easy and simple. Even my husband who usually rolls his eyes when I come home with ""gadgets"" for the baby thinks it's great. We've used it for 4 flights so far and my husband even went through security and took the car seat on the plane with this, carrying our little guy in his seat the whole time. We're very happy with it and hope it continues to work well for us as he gets bigger!"
3,Pretty good,I now have two of these products and they work pretty well. The first time I used this product I strapped it to my luggage put my son in it and the whole thing flipped upside down with my son still in it and I was still moving forward not even aware of what happened. You have to make sure that you have this product on properly and very tight if you want it to be safe and effective. It is great just to tote you car seat also if you don't want to put your child in it. I did get a lot of parents wanting to know where I had bought it at!
5,MUCH BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL FUSHIGI YUGI,"Ok,so I'm wasn't a BIG fan of Fushigi Yuig, although I liked it to a certain degree.When I saw the advertisement in a mag, I thought, 'oh, I should check it out', and I did, and it was THE BEST.Takiko isn't as whiny as Miaka, but she's still so funny, and of course the there's a love interest, but it's also so much CUTER.The characters don't get together so fast,and Takiko's love interest is what's the word..I don't know more outgoing than Tamahome maybe? Anyway, wether you're a FY lover or not, if you like Yuu Watase's stuff, this one is THE ONE!!!"
4,As Good as the origianal,"I just started reading the orginal FY series a few months ago, and I totally fell in love with that story. So, it was only natural that I am also reading Genbu Kaiden.Genbu Kaiden is the story of the first girl to come to the Universe of the Four Gods, wich is a universe that exist in a book of the same name. When a girl begins to read the book, she is pulled in and transported to the land of one of the four gods. Takiko is taken to the land of Genbu.One of the reasons that I like this series so much, is because it's so different from the origianal Fushigi Yugi, but it's almost just as good. Like I said before. I really look forward to reading the rest of the series and finding out what happens. Although, if you've read the first series, then you know what Takiko's fate will be. That does make it a little sad, but that isn't something that should stop you from reading it. So, buy it, and read it."
3,no pronounciation,"the worst thing is to buy a new-language ""course"" that does not teach you how to pronounce. german is very difficult to pronounce and there is no clue whatsoever about pronounciation.the rest is fine i think.the same author has ""beginners' german"" which contains the pronounciation but with no grammer!!!! the editing of the two books has many gaps."
5,"All great, Dame Janet Baker shines","For me Dame Janet Baker is THE best Mahler singer. Like her English predecessor Kathleen Ferrier, Baker's voice is characterised by that marvellous juxtaposition of warmth and a tragic tone. She can be devastating, even-toned and has great stamina."
5,wonderful!,This was a great quality gift. I also purchased the wax sealing sticks to go with it. Made a great gift!
2,Incomplete!,"I bought this book because I loved it as a kid, but this version is NOT the same as the original. It is missing the best ""scary thing"" of all.. the apple with a mustache! I will be looking for a vintage edition."
2,A product not yet designed,This sprayer is not yet designed. The hoses are too short -- by a frustrating few inches. The pressure gage is directly on the output of the pump and therfore oscillates so violently one cannot see the needle. (I will add a damper to prevent a fatigue failure of the gage.) The connector to the spray wand broke off during my first use session.(I have replaced the thin-walled plastic part with a brass part. I have replaced the cheap plastic hose clamps with real clamps to stop the leaks. The pickpup hose is curled so that the pickup screen would not stay near the bottom of the tank. I have added a weight to the end of the pickup hose.This product is not badly designed. It has not been designed at all.
1,Does Not Work As Advertised,"This sprayer advertises that it puts out 1.8 gallons per minute. It does not. This is an easy specification to measure so there is no doubt of the result. I spent over an hour on the phone with Agri-Fab and they were unable to make any adjustments to the pump that achieved any better than 0.6 GPM. Without regurgitating all the details, I needed at least 1 gallon per minute to achieve the dilution recommended - even if I were able to go 1 mile per hour on my tractor - and I was simply unable to achieve this.If something is advertised I expect result at least close to specifications. I am now faced with disassembling, packing, shipping at my cost, and returning this item. Amazon should enforce some truth in advertising before someone else is affected by this improper claim.Bill"
2,Disappointing,"This sprayer does work but I encountered the following problems:1. When full or near full the liquid solution comes out of the top where the hoses enter the tank spilling in areas not intended for the spray. The solution will also come out when going up or down hills if it reaches the hose areas.2. When the switch is turned off after spraying, solution continues to drain from the boom at a fairly substantial rate. I have to turn the valve off to stop the flow.3. There is no way that this unit will put out the maximum amount of solution that is advertised.I also own another spray rig from Northern Supply that does not have the above problems. I chose to buy this rig since I needed a bigger tank and it has its own wheels. I got those features but I wish I'd have gone with the Northern version.On the up side, it did spray well enough and with sufficient amount of herbicide to take care of my pasture weeds."
2,written for peoplec who already know the material?,"This entire subject is very difficult. I suppose that i wouldn't know that this bookwas bad if i hadn't read better?Computability: An Introduction to Recursive Function Theoryfor instance, uses much more understandable language and symbols.In most cases books in this area of language and automata theory are difficult,but most authors realize this and try to make the textmore understandable. I suppose if this were a text for a classI'd be faced with trying to find a Schaum's outline text to get me through the course?In other words the text is a failure that seems to be difficult foreven people who are familiar with the material.My heart goes out to students who have only this text for their class:an instructor that choses such a text will be no help in his lectures?"
2,Very Dissapointing,After Having finished reading this book I found myself asking more questions than I felt were answered for me. From a pedagogical point of view this book leaves much to be desire. At times it is out and out confusing and seemingly contradictory. I am told this is supposed to be a classic: such a shame!
3,Excellent as a reference; pathetic as a textbook,"There is, strictly speaking, no in-between for this book: it's either 5 stars or zero stars depending on the intended use.It's very simple: Don't use it if _____, and do use it if ____.Do NOT even THINK of buying this book:1. If this is going to be your first brush with formal languages and the theory of computation.2. If you need to get motivated to learn the subject, and you need that ""first grasp"" on it.3. If you're taking a first course in the subject, and if you have an IQ below 130!On the other hand,You MUST buy this book:1. If you already have some background, and you want a larger picture.2. If you will often need an authoritative source for proofs etc.3. If you need a reference for formalizing concepts touched on elsewhere."
3,"Five-star reference, one-star textbook","This slim volume is the standard reference for research in automata theory, languages, and computation (especially regular and context-free languages). For that, it gets five stars. As a textbook for students, however, it is dense, uneven, and confusing throughout. Generations of novice computer scientists have been soured forever on theory by being forced to endure this book in their undergraduate- and graduate-level theory courses.Conclusion: buy this book and keep it on your shelf, with the other essential references, but if you want to *learn* the material, look elsewhere -- for example, Michael Sipser's excellent new textbook, _Introduction to the Theory of Computation_."
2,Not a good choice for your first contact with automatas,"This book may be an excellent reference text, but as a learning tool it is abysmal. It is confusing and takes a lot of knowledge for granted. I second earlier reviews and recommend Michael Sipser's ""Introduction to the Theory of Computation"" instead, which has to be one of the best books I've ever read for class."
3,A reference book,"This is *not* a good book to use as an introduction to computation theory (CT). If you *already* know CT and look at this book, everything will make perfect sense and seem 'obvious'. If this is your first exposure to CT, then this book will seem very confusing. There are far far better books to purchase if you wish to *learn* CT, namely ""Introduction to the Theory of Computation"" by Michael Sipser. Once you have the basics down, you will be able to appreciate the detail of the Hopcroft book.As a reference book, however, it is very good. It is extremely concise which makes it easy to zoom in on definitions and theorems without having to wade through explanations.If you are taking a course in CT and this is the text you are using, then I suggest either getting Sipser's book or hope you have a really good prof!"
5,Packed with useful information,"This book is well written, laid out nicely and packed with information about successful sales based on understanding customer needs, building trust and delivering solutions. Every chapter has good background information, useful lists and ""to dos"" and examples. Great for the salesperson, sales manager or marketing professional. There are lots of immediate takeaways in this book."
2,Not durable enough for outdoors,"I took these on a 5 day camping trip, to use with my stainless steel cook set. All of the pieces show wear, the nylon is peeling off on the edges. I didn't leave them in the pans on the stove, nor did I cook anything that stuck to the pan. I am really disappointed in how cheap these were made. Buy a quality utensil set and a key ring to keep them together, but don't buy these."
1,Red ink comes off,"After opening the package and handling the utensils, I noticed that my hands were red.I had to scrub the 3-piece set several times before the red ink stoped comming off, because of the concern with lead in the ink comming from China, I decided to throw the set away."
2,Not good,"Go to your local dollar store and buy some spoons and spatulas and you'll get something of equal or better quality. I didn't have the problem with the red dye rubbing off, but regardless I wouldn't purchase these utensils again. The only upside is that they don't melt--we used them making scrambled eggs in a cast iron pan and the spatula survived."
3,Good product-Terrible shipping,"The wizard itself is a good product but I was deceived about shipping, and had to proceed on a job with the bark attached as it took weeks to get it. The bark will have to be removed later mostly by hand. I waited a week or so for it arrive and then was told it was on backorder and waited another 2 weeks for it to arrive."
4,A Song To Remember DVD,This DVD is very good except if you need to wear a hearing aid you will find the dialogue is faint and hard to hear. Too bad it doesn't have closed captions.The music is terrific and Cornell Wilde and Merle Oberon great however Paul Muni is a drag overacting and given too much attention. This is hardly a true biography of Chopin but the piano playing makes it all worthwhile.
2,Cheap bootleg copy!,This title has never been officially released on DVD by the movie company that owns the rights to it. An NTSC DVD with Mandarin Chinese? Obviously a bootleg.
2,"Ridiculous facts, but fantastic fainting","For anyone who is really looking for the facts, don't see this movie! However, if you like extreme drama and death bed scenes it is pretty stirring. My ultimate favorite scence is when he faints after his final concert."
3,See it as fiction...,"Despite many nominations, this film didn't bring home the bacon. Its a fictional, rather overblown account of Chopin's rise to fame, a process which had its ups and downs. Cornel Wilde does a nice, sympathetic, sensitive job as Frederic, and his piano playing was convincing; Paul Muni's part was way overly inflated even though his character wasn't very interesting; Merle Oberon was a good choice and enjoyed a come-back of sorts here, however noone comes away feeling sorry for her. The film could have used some strict editing, however the music was quite enjoyable."
5,great,it was great the product was on time it was in great shape and i will continue to shop amozon.
4,A very difficult DVD to find,"I was very pleased to find ""Song to Remember"" available for purchase from Amazon. It was not available on DVD rental sites. Some years ago, I was also very pleased to find a copy of ""Elvira Madigan"" in a very similar form."
1,Regressive and concerning,"Kirkus is on target here. This book prescribes the ""easy solution"" so many regressive conservatives are peddling these days: a return to the golden age of 1950 (when so many women who did as they were expected to were frustrated and so far from fulfilled they couldn't define the term.) In spite of Crittenden's efforts, there is no one answer for all women. And absolutely nothing here that I can see working in my childfree yet still very full real life."
5,Something every woman and man should read.,"Crittenden brings up a lot of issues modern women face today that are not widely discussed on either side of the political spectrum. Although her views are fairly conservative, Crittenden does not so much attack feminist thought as she brings up things feminists conveniently forget to tell women. For example, she says there is nothing wrong with wanting to pursue a career first and put off family until later, but you have to realize that your body is not going to magically stop aging which means it might be difficult to have the family you want if you wait.This is a really thought-provoking book, one that you could definitely read again and again in different stages of your life. It will make you think about important things you should be considering as you look ahead in your life. I did not necessarily agree with every thing that she said, but it definitely helped me examine my life and my plans."
4,"Eye-Opening. Identifies Modern Problems, But Does Not Pose Real Solutions","I found this to be a very interesting and eye-opening read. I had formed some of the beliefs Crittenden states prior to reading this book, but it really helped cement my own thoughts on marriage and children. I appreciate the unique points she states throughout the book, but Crittenden seems to rely more on anecdotes rather than facts and/or statistics.Although I agree with most of what she writes, she fails to come up with valid solutions to our current ""problems."" (A large problem being that women and couples wait too long to have children) Most young married couples simply could not afford to raise a young child on one income even if they did ""cut back"" on luxuries.Additionally, Crittenden is pretty critical when writing about this generation and our mother's generation. So I imagine readers who do not already share a view similar to hers will not appreciate this book."
1,Get married early so we can have kids early?,"Silly me, I always thought people should get married when they felt emotionally and financially ready -and have kids when they were emotionally and financially ready, too! Thank heaven I have Danielle Crittenden to tell me that's all wrong. We should marry young because when we're ""older"" (like 30?!) men won't want us. All I can say to that, honey, is that any man who doesn't want me because he prefers young things is a man I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYHOW!"
4,Rhetoric It Is Not,"Danielle Crittenden does a great service to this generation of young women and men by presenting some well-researched facts and well-thought-out ideas on the subject of male-female relationship in this very readable book.As a middle-aged man, my interest in a book titled as this one was initially very low. However, I find myself very much absorbed as I started to turn the pages.Miss Crittenden took on a very complex and controversial subject in what might be called a contrarian approach, and presented some revealing facts, refreshing ideas and insightful analysis. With so much poisonous theories and commentary that built and shaped the gender battlefront, which should never have been, this book is one that invites the readers to take a rational look at what women really want from the opposite sex and the society at large.If you have a daughter (or friend) at her late teens or early twenties, you should introduce her to this book. Yes, it could be life-changing for her."
1,The stereotypical and strictly biological dead-end fate of being a woman,"An unsophisticated analysis of women as simple, one-dimensional creatures who lack complexities or uniqueness entirely. In fact, we shall think of ourselves and our united fate in terms of biology alone.What Our Grandmothers Didn't Tell Us: Why Happiness Eluded the 1950s WomanMs. Crittenden (or, I assume Mrs.) makes the assumption that because therapy, antidepressants, and divorce were not as acceptable to 1950s society, and thereby not utilized at any alarming rate, women were fulfilled being married mothers. I pity any woman or man who feels that her or his own lifestyle and beliefs are OSFA. That is the thought process of a child; egocentric and underdeveloped."
1,"Women should be kept barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen.","There. Now you don't have to read it. One less thing to worry your pretty little heads over.Besides, shouldn't you be looking to your husband for guidance, not some book? All that squinting at the page will just gives you crow's feet anyway."
1,what males want you to think,"EQUAL ( appeciation )or pay has ALWAYS been ignored by people like you,and the male population, when it comes to managing and maintaining a HOUSEHOLD, MUCH less a home! shame on you for saying things like,women who choose to WORK or stay at home! staying at home IS NOT eating chocolat and watching t.v. staying at home IS a full time JOB. why do you think males choose to pay higher wages to other males who leave home to work?it's really difficult to see why females will except whatever they are told by ""society"" instead of seeing the reality that is IN their own lives, and they're personal desires.you just perpetuate the myth""equal"". people who REAR CHILDREN are at least as valuable to society as the president of the country, just watch the news and see how well our children are rearing themselves.if you can't get the truth out, you should at LEAST be listed as fiction."
1,This book is shallow and tunnel-visioned.,"This book reads like a mediocre term paper. I'm amazed that a 35-year-old writer and publisher can understand so little about the complexity of human lives and relationships. She may grow in wisdom over the next 10-20 years, and may also meet a few more of the masses of divorced women who married early."
5,Right on the money,"Every sentence in this book hits the nail right on the head. I swear, I am going to write Danielle a letter one of these days and tell her what a genius she is."
2,Gloom and Doom,"What a depressing book! I wasn't unhappy before I read this book, but I sure am now! This was not a helpful book in the slightest for anyone wrestling with the stay at home, go to work issue. It is mostly an accusatory guilt trip for modern women! Her solution to this is to troll for a husband and crank out those kids early, and then you can go on to have a satisfying career while tose kids are safe in school. What utter nonsense! While I feel her premise that there is no substitute for a parent's care, there are alternatives to completely giving up one's career. For a really good perspective, read Cokie Robert's book about a modern woman balancing career and family. It can be done, and done well. The happy spin that this author put on the 1950's parent is a view a lot of overworked moms are now clinging to. The 50's weren't so great, and moms had issues as well."
1,Elitist & condescending book,"The only women who could benefit from reading this book are white, wealthy, pretty, and lucky. Crittenden assumes that all women would benefit from marrying young and forgoing careers to have babies in their twenties. It MIGHT work - if the woman is lucky enough to get a first-rate education and find a man who is wealthy enough to support her and moral enough not to divorce her. The rest of us (and that's about 95%) will just have to tough it out and invest in our careers. The reality is that most people who marry young wind up divorced, and that with no-fault divorce there is NO guarantee of life-long marriage anymore. Crittenden also condescendingly imagines that no woman in her 30's can possibly attract a decent men - her ""shelf life"" has expired. I thought Susan Faludi debunked that long ago in ""Backlash"". Crittenden's book is elitist claptrap that simply has no bearing on the lives of most American women"
4,human AND female,"A strong argument against the androgyny project of the last 30 years. Most of her points are common sense, but it says something that they are controversial. I especially liked her point that while feminism allowed women to express and nurture their humanity, it did so at the expense of their biology and this was a reverse of the previous situation where women were allowed to express their biology, but not their individuality. Would be nice to be able to do both, but she makes a strong argument for the fact that we really can't in the current ideological climate. Good book! I wish all young women would read it."
1,Why is she telling WOMEN to marry younger how about the MEN!,Why doesn't her book address all the 20 year old men who delay marriage?? Why doesn't she address the work force that makes parents leave their children for 8 hours a day!! With the proliferation of computers in homes today how many people are actually able to find work at home??Why doesn't she just come out & tell woman to marry millionaires? The man who doesn't want a thirty something woman is a immature pig!!It's about personal choices. My parents were in their 40's & late 30's when they had me & you know what I think I'm going to wait until I'm 40 to have my first child.
5,Refreshing,"This book was refreshing and offered an alternative to the all-too-prevalent ""More, More, More!!"" attitudes today. (...)"
1,Worst Book Ever,"This quite possibly is one of the worst books I've ever read. Our company tried to read/study this together and we only made it 1/2 way through because of the poorly written and completely unapplicable content. I generally don't write bad reviews of products, but this is one I had to tell people about."
2,"Badly written book, good packaging","After reading 100+ pages, my knowledge of MBA programs and MBA practices has not increased at all. This is a random collection of essays with little practical use. This is not a ""How-To"" book or a ""Cookbook"" by any means. This book is very light on practical advice, and I doubt that it would help anyone learn about MBAs. Although it was written by people who have MBAs, their writing has almost nothing to do with getting an MBA yourself.I was pretty disappointed with the quality of writing. There are better MBA books out there."
5,Excellent and griping account,"Petra Nemcova's book about the tsunami is very detailed and gripping. But what I didn't expect in this book was such an interesting account of her life and her love story with Simon Atlee. It surprised and had me riveted to her every word. I wanted to read a survivor's account of the tsunami but I got so much more. I hope she writes another book, which I would surely read, about her work with the Happy Hearts Fund and her life now. The sign of a true good book to me is that I didn't want it to end, and this is one of those times. Excellent, uplifting, and a good read."
2,Not Inspired,"It would seem that I am the only reader who didn't find this book inspiring. I will sound cruel when I say that I found it vapid. I am sorry that Petra lost her lover in such a tragic way, and I am sorry that she had a challenging childhood. I don't mean to sound cruel, it's just that I don't see what is inspiring in this book. Many, many, many people have lost lovers to tragedy, have been severely injured and experienced heartache, have had a tough childhood. That does not necessarily make an inspiring book. The center of this book contains about 50 full color modeling photos of Petra. A couple of them would have been enough. I kept reading, trying to keep an open mind, looking for the inspiration and I didn't find it. Petra has a lot of money that obviously was instrumental in helping her get over her heartbreak."
1,Wrong!!!,We ordered this item twice! Twice it came and was the wrong size - smaller than we ordered. The carton was marked the correct size but the item was over twice smaller. We had to go through the whole return rigamarole twice. A real pain. But I will say Amazon quickly let us know by email that the item had been returned and promptly refunded our money. Both times!
2,"Better than Ryobi 10"" one speed at same rpm","Use this if your forearms or wrists hurt and you need a break from the hard work of wax removal. It will help, but you will still have to wipe up after it and you will do a better job. I am very disappointed that there are two speeds but that the first speed is useless. The Ryobi that I gave away last year had only one speed and claimed to have the same rpm. It was, in fact, weaker. Perhaps it has an inferior motor. I don't know but this one left wax even though I flipped the terry cloth pad and followed up with a lambs wool (not included) pad. My dad has a variable speed Ryobi that he says is good. Neither Home Depot or Osh sold anything worth getting. Well, Osh had a Milwaulkee (not sure spelling) for $189 but the salesman said they make one in the $89 range that would be safer in the hands of the inexperienced shine-obsessed person. Ugh...black cars...and the search continues."
4,Cutest shoes you ever did see!,"I actually sent these back and ordered a red pair in a larger size. They are pretty true to size; my daughter just had growth spurt. They are expensive, but so adorable. My 8-year old loves them and all the detail seems to be staying on the shoe."
4,A favorite with the little ones,"This book is very popular with my one year old. First, he loves Elmo and he loves animals. Also, my busy little one does not sit still very long and this book is brief enough to complete in a very short time. It is sturdy and colorful and I am certain that our copy will wear out someday and we will be buying another one."
4,Elmo is always a hit!,"This book is fun! It's got tabs on the sides with pictures of Elmo dressed as the various characters on each page. It's a board book, so the pages turn easily and are smooth/shiny, so if your toddler goobers on them, you can simply wipe it down! The story is just about Elmo going to the zoo and pretending he's each one of the animals he sees. It's a very cute book and we read it multiple times a day! The one complaint I have about it is that the edges of the cardboard have started to fray apart a little bit since we read it so much. I was hoping it would be a little more durable than that, but it's nothing that makes it unreadable."
4,Pretty good but not a hit with my kid just yet,"This book is a cute exploration of animals with Elmo dressing up as different animals and describing what he could do if he was actually that particular animal. It is colorful and short and my five month old will sit through it and seems to pay attention and look at the pictures. However, we have other books that seem to interest her more. Perhaps it is because this book doesn't rhyme or have anything for her to touch that has an interesting texture. I will keep reading it to her, however, and see if she becomes more engaged as she gets older and understands more about each animal. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and will definitely be ordering more Elmo, I'm sure!"
1,Hinge sucks,"The box itself is beautiful, but the hinge already broke. Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It broke and hit my son in the head. Poor thing has a huge bump!"
2,Hurts chinchillas,my pet chinchillas love to run on the wheels we have but the problem is these wheels are not made well. the metal breaks and hurts the chinchillas so owners MUST KEEP CHECKING to make sure chinchillas are not HURTING.
4,chin wheel,It's the best available but an improvement would be if the chin's back would clear the hindges when he runs
2,"It will do, but not what was photoed","I really wanted one that was not mesh, but got mesh anyways. Very disappointed."
2,Fine if you're not a chinchilla,"The wheel is advertised as being safe for chinchillas, which I find to be a bit cruel. The way a chinchillas hands and feet are built, it is extremely easy for their claws to get stick in the mesh pattern of this wheel. If this happens and the injury is not caught in time, it could lead to serious issues, such as amputation of the leg that was damage. Furthermore, the wheel has side spokes (The bars that go across the middle on either side.) Chinchillas like to run, then jump out of the wheel, and because of this behavior it is very dangerous to use a wheel with side spokes, as their tails could get caught in it.If you're getting this product for a rat or mouse, it's safer, but I still wouldn't fully trust it. I advise finding a wheel that's solid, and has no spokes on the side. Sometimes safety is more important than frugality."
4,Best wheel for rats,"This wheel is the most ideal type for use with rats. The square mesh does not catch tails or limbs and it is easier to clean this way. Wheels with a single spoke on one side always bend and stop spinning. This one does not and can be set anywhere from one to five inches off the ground by bending the stand. While after a while it squeaks, petroleum jelly applied once on the axles lasts many months and keeps it quiet. While after a year or two so it may become corroded around the spokes and break, this wheel is cheap enough to replace, and they can't destroy it by chewing, which could reduce a plastic wheel's life to mere months.This wheel is probably not the best for chinchillas and you should look into a solid wheel for such creatures."
3,Not the same quality that it was 2 years ago,"I ordered this wheel 3 times. The first time was back in 2010, the wheel I ordered in 2010 seemed sturdy and did not arrive to me bent. I decided to order another wheel in 2011 just to freshen up my chinchilla's cage. The wheel arrived to me all bent up, and had sharp spokes, so I returned it. I just kept the wheel I bought in 2010, then this year 2012 when I bought my chinchilla a new cage I decided to try ordering a new wheel again, again, it came bent, but this time I bent it back into shape and kept it. This product seems to have a quality control problem. Overall I do like the wheel, but wish it was of the same quality that it was when I ordered it back in 2010."
1,Don't buy for chinchillas!!,I bought one of these for my chinchilla and my poor little boy pinched his tail in it and it tore the fur off of his tail!!
2,my ls400,"These blew out (became inoperable) in less than 2 years. Kinda bogus. I had hoped for better construction, especially for the price."
5,Very Good Book,"It is a very well written book with many pictures showing you proper technique. You won't become a black belt, but if you want to take a class you won't be completely lost with exercises, names of each position and general knowledge."
2,Forget about it.,Don't be fooled by the title. This book is not going to give you the knowledge of a blackbelt Shotokan karateka in twelve months. It is a good book that provides an overview of the basics that you can get elsewhere for a lot less money. Most of the stuff in the book you will pick up in a few months at a good dojo.
1,Popstars ?,"Being a French myself, I heard, of course, of the tv show that made those 5 girls famous, and even watched the program a few times. To my surprise, I found that the girls were quite nice and that at least two of them had a pretty voice. As to their first album (made all in a rush after they won the show), I didn't buy it but, well, it could have been much worse. So when their second release Retiens-moi came out, I gave it a try. And I was REALLY disappointed. The music is so bad, I can't even describe it. I am not even sure I would call it music, actually. It's all beats and nothing more. Their voices are most irritating and do not fit with the musical surrounding at all. I listened to the songs a few times and cannot even remember any of them. They said they took their time to release this one, but I think that's a waste. I wouldn't even recommand it to your teenage kids. If they do not change direction for their next release, that'll be the end of the group I think."
1,Boring- very boring!,"This record is very bad. I think the songs are boring; we have too many dull bands like this in England. And why is ""Maniac"" sung in English, when they are French?! I will not be listening to this again. All the songs just drone into one another.Alizée and Lorie are a millions times better than L5 will ever be- their songs are fun, catchy, funky- and IN FRENCH only! Try them- and NOT `L5'!"
5,James Ellroy,The above review is a bit tongue & cheek. There is no Paula Abdul garbage in this album! This album is melodic and it rocks. It reminds me a bit of the Get Up Kids minus the emo keyboard with great weaving guitars. All songs are solid you will not skip around on this disc. The formula is straight indie...light on the production for a quasi raw sound with a get up off your feet sound. Try it you will like it.
5,Arizona Music Rocks!!!,"This band is truely one of the best indie bands out right now. I'm getting sick of all the poppy punk music. This is definitely not one of those bands. I compare R.A. more to Jimmy Eat World, where their lyrics are cool and they jam out to some rocking beats. Happy Mondays is great! I also like Fireworks. But the whole CD is good. Definitely worth buying this album. I can't wait for their next release and I hope they can travel up to the midwest. Detroit needs to jump onto this style of music!!!"
4,Useful scientific writing tool,"As the title says, and as Weston writes in his introduction, this is ""...not a text book, but a rule book."" This short book is a useful desk reference for technical and scientific writers looking for practical approaches to structure written arguments clearly and logically."
1,"A lightweight pamphlet, not a text","This is a lightweight pamphlet written about proposition, not a meaty discourse on the philosphical argument. If you are looking for the different type and processes of argument, look for something in critical thinking or philosphy."
1,"If I don't want to listen the author's argument, then he's not a good teacher.","The book assumes you are interested in rational arguments. In any case the book is not interesting to read. I know little about arguments, but if the argument isn't interested, whether it is good or not is secondary. In order to win any argument or succeed you must first be interesting. This books fails at that."
3,A basic but helpful shortcut for beginners and undergrads,"I do agree with the majority of reviewers here this little book does help to improve one's critical and logical thinking. However, I am obliged to comment that the degree of satisfaction depends much on a reader's previous experience with similar books and his/her level/background of education. That's nothing the matter with the capabilities of the author but apparently he had tailored his book to be as concise and easy to read as possible. In that respect, he had done a good job. For advanced readers, ""Asking the Right Questions: A Guide to Critical Thinking by Neil Browne"" and ""101 Philosophy Problems by Martin Cohen"" would be more suitable."
1,Complete waste of money,"The toy has been in my dog's ""hands"" for 10 minutes...The paint is already gone, having peeled right off of this ""Tough Tube,"" and now my dog has just torn a hole in the toy. That works out to about a dollar minute. Need I say more??? I'll be complaining to the manufacturer as well.Amazon should really have a zero star option because this toy qualifies."
4,Fascinating Study of Tudor England,"Author Plowden is very well known for her books concerning the Tudor dynasty of England. This book traces the story of Henry VIII's sister, Mary who first wed the elderly King of France. Upon his swift demise, Mary pursued and won the man she wanted, Charles Brandon. For a while she was banned from court for daring to marry for love, instead of dynastic reasons. From this marriage, her offspring and their descendants would be tightly controlled by the subsequent Tudor monarchs, Edward V, Mary I and Elizabeth I.While focusing on primarily Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Mary Tudor, all other descendants (primarily female) are also discussed. The complication succession to the throne made a minefield which ruined many lives.The book is very well written and quotes extensively from original sources. I would recommend it and any other Plowden books to anyone interested in Tudor England."
4,Very high quality popular history,"Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, was not only the brother-in-law of Henry VIII but also his best friend; after the king's own children, Brandon's descendants were named heirs to the crown. The duke's granddaughter, Jane Grey, died for her legacy at the age of sixteen, a Protestant intellectual challenging the accession of the Catholic Mary Tudor. Jane's sister Catherine subsequently ruined her chances to become heir-presumptive to Elizabeth I by her unauthorized marriage to the earl of Hertford -- and then by presuming to give birth to a healthy son (seven of whose close relatives lay buried headless under the chapel in the Tower where he was christened). The Suffolk drama would have been a fitting subject for a Shakespear-ean tragedy."
3,"So close,yet so far.....","This book concentrates too much about Lady Jane Grey. I know it is called ""LADY JANE GREY and the House of Suffolk"", but the parts about Jane aren't detailed enough to be a biography, and the rest is too short and foggy to be read as an equal family saga.So close,yet so far."
3,"Yes,lots of Jane Grey-but what about poor Eleanor Brandon?","It is really helpful in describing and understanding the Tudor period,but it's unbalanced.1 page on Mary Grey,2 chapters on the French Queen,Mary Tudor,1 paragragh on Frances Brandon.There's this uneveness."
1,False advertisement,It stated when I purchase this item it was PACK OF 36. Why did it only get one bottle. I will never order from this vendor again.....
2,depressing,"This book will prove very discouraging to a parent looking for answers. It's all, ""well on the one hand this may work but on the other hand it hasn't been proven"" so what's a parent to do in the meantime - Dr. Schrieibman doesn't say. She also dimisses ""Options"" as a useful method without even getting its name right. If you're looking for hope, I recommend Let Me Hear Your Voice by Catherine Maurice for a well documented success story."
4,Ofra Haza 1997,Ofra Haza 1997 being the final full-length album before Ms Haza's untimely passing 2000. Frank Peterson that had helped Sara Brightman reach mainstream success and one can only imagine if this had come to fruition if she had not died at such a young age. Ms Haza had an amazing voice and her vocal skills were some of the best in the business. All the lyrics are included in the booklet and we get a list of whom plays what on the album. The album has many very nice photographs of Ms Haza. I disagree with Allmusic that only gives it 3/5 and in my opinion this is more a 4/5 release. 4/5.
4,Series Ending,I bought for my grand daughter because she hit missed the ending of her favorite show. She loved the way the series ended and the built up to that end. It was different than the standard Robin Hood story a fun ride.
2,Just OK,"This is a pretty cheesy series. But I did watched all three seasons, so it does kind of hook you. The plots are pretty lame, and many many times it is completely unbelievable (it evoked many groans from me). They (the robin hood gang) are constantly getting into impossible situations and then escaping too easily. The villains aren't believably bad. I did like the ending, but if I could do it over, I wouldn't have wasted my time."
2,Who is this show for really?,"Most people who tune in to watch a TV show entitled Robin Hood probably fall into three groups. The first two are closely related: people who like Robin Hood and medieval junkies (like myself). The third group are people who just want a fun show to watch and who don't care about period accuracy or the legends at all. This show is aimed at the latter group, which doesn't much real sense.Season 3 of this new incarnation looks much better than 1 and 2, but there are still daft choices which might be OK if the show was set in a fantasy land. A female sheriff of Nottingham (??), a black Friar Tuck (???!) and the odd ninja weapon (?????!!!!). All this makes it very hard to take seriously.For me, this show will always be squarely in the shadow of the old 1980s Robin of Sherwood TV show, imperfect as it was. One thing both versions have in common are the arbitrary decisions to write out Maid Marion in unsatisfactory ways."
2,chuck it and start over,"Season one was pretty entertaining and season two was pretty good too. A bit too politically correct at time and a few episodes were poor in taste and quality but, in general, quite an entertaining show and most were good. Season 3 is a waste of time and effort. The writers should (must) be replaced (was there a writers strike in the U.K.? Must have been). Still, I hope the failure of season 3 doesn't mean the end of the show but that they will go back to the beginning and miraculously bring back some key characters they've killed off (find a new Marian, Allan, etc.) and start over and kind of pretend season 3 never happened. Hopefully, they'll go back to fun and somewhat realistic escapes and rescues and develop the characters they have and the comradery between them. Season three is a waste but we'll see what the result will be."
5,Columbo: Mystery Movie Collection 1990,I thought I had all of Columbo's DVD and was pleasantly surprised to find this one.Have enjoyed it very much.
3,it's about time...,they came out with the next installment of the series. one thing only i didn't like and that is once you start an episode and even at the end of an episode you cannot access the main menu. you have to eject the dvd and then reinsert it to get to the main menu or the next episode. never had to ever do that with any dvd I own. somebody sure messed up somewhere when they designed this dvd. it's quite annoying.
3,Columbo Lovers,"Episodes are classic columbo however: this format is not in widescreen! The 1991-1993 video is when they started widescreen format. It makes it so much better to see the entire screen filled up!Columbo is quite older in the 1989 and later videos which are made for tv 2 hour episodes.But they are still interesting. However, if you want widescreen, buy the 1991 and later videos!!"
5,I love Columbo,"Since Columbo reruns have disappeared from TV, I am really enjoying these DVDs. Product is well made and video is very clear."
3,Columbo 1990 Mystery Movie Collection,"I do enjoy the individual episodes on this set of DVDs. What caused me to give the set only 3 stars is the way they set up the DVDs menu. ALL the other Columbo collections have a menu that allow you to Play ALL or play the episode you want to see. But if you choose to play a certain episode when it is over you get taken back to the main menu and get to pick Play ALL or any episode on the DVD. THIS collection decided to leave off the Play ALL option, so you must pick a certain episode to watch. When the episode is over the DVD does NOT go back to the main menu but only goes back to the menu allowing you to play the episode you JUST watched.As we always used the play all option on Columbo DVDs we were VERY unhappy to find it missing and MORE unhappy when we found how difficult they made it to even watch the different episodes."
2,Disappointing...,"I love the Columbo TV series so I thought I would also enjoy the movie collections, but I was wrong. They have none of the charm and cleverness of the TV series. The storylines are boring and since they're movies, they are longer and the set up takes forever...not necessarily a bad thing if the story was interesting. Also, unlike the the series, the movies have a lot of sexual situations which are not intriguing in any way and just look ridiculous. Plus, the 90s style was so tacky--the clothes, hairstyles, interior design... Everyone is trying to look cool but look silly instead. It's like watching Miami Vice today and wondering ""what were they thinking?""Anyway, the price was right when I bought them and I thought I got a great deal but it was just a waste of money for me. I'll stick to the TV series."
4,Columbo Movies,"My Mom & I enjoyed Columbo when I was living with her ... now many years later, she is 95 and I gave here these DVD's for her birthday. She is living with me and we are enjoying them together."
2,Columbo Collection 1990,"took a little while for the movie to get here....an after I got it I saw what the other people were talking about...ie there was just NOT ENOUGH Columbo on each disc! not only that, there were two separate series on each one an NO WAY to go back an watch the second one after the first one was over! that meant taking the disc completely out an putting it back in to go to the next movie! (that was not fun!!)being a Columbo lover, I also thought the discs were a little grainy at times,,,.(I'm used to my movies being clear, especially on dvd) all in all, I doubt if I would recommend this one to any of my Columbo fans!"
5,Selections from James Harrington,"This book is a compilation of writings by English utopian philosopher James Harrington (1611-1677). He was a political theorist of classical republicanism, best known for his writing The Commonwealth of Oceana (included in this collection), a book which was censored and seized by Oliver Cromwell. Harrington was subsequently arrested and tortured.This collection includes:Part I: A System of Politics(Includes 10 articles/selections, on government, civil disobedience, religion, military, etc).Part II: The Commonwealth of OceanaPart III: The Rota(Includes 6 articles/selections on forming a utopian model of a free state based on equal commonwealth)"
2,"""Metal Phantom of the Exorcist""","I think that ""progressive-rock"" needs one more distinction added as far as classification. If the musicians, no matter how articulate, love rage, anger, and violence; anf feel that every event they encounter is the fault of ""society...or GOD"", and take no personal responsibility for their own sanity- THAT KIND of 'music' should should come with a warning: This CD is not intended to bring greater clarity or insight. It is merely designed to help you play out your rage. Another Gothic nightmare....ho-humm . I think I'll have a beer with Tony Iomme."
5,Wow!,"Okay, I'm going to make this one short because I think it is unneccessary to get into things here. This album $%$$^# ROCKS! To be honest, I did not ever hear about this band before until I was searching some metal bands on myspace and took a listen and heard ""Inside the Monster"" and thought it was an amazing song. How the heck did these guys go unnoticed? I am a huge metalhead, to a certain extent for I really don't care at all for these death metal bands, i.e. Lamb of God and other 2nd stage acts at Ozzfest. I love loud guitars and such, don't get me wrong but I can't handle a band that has a singer that, well, can't sing.Anyways, getting off topic. This band is great musically and they seem to bring something fresh that is missing in metal nowadays. And not only are they good at thundering metal but they can go ballad to like on ""Heavenly"". Point being, buy this album now. You will not regret it."
2,"Good melodies, but no structure","This CD is great - melody wise, you've got some good lead guitar work, and some good vocal melodies. Other than that, there's really not a whole lot to this CD. Basically, I like it somewhat, but it just gets boring to my ears after the first 2 songs. They don't really know how to structure songs that well (anymore, their older material was so much better), and the drumwork is a letdown. I've heard of going minimal, but this is simplistic. Overall, they're a great band... but this CD is not their best."
4,Charming tale,"I enjoyed this novel because of the quietness. This isn't the hustle bustle Steel style novel. This is the story of people and their lives. I enjoyed how Jean moved from her grief over her failed marriage to her emotional rebirth on the Island. However I enjoyed all the little details of the village life almost as much. That part reminded me of DE Stevenson, the Scots-English novelist. McClellan has done a very nice job with this book and has written a sequel, The White Rose of Scotland. I even shared the first book at a recent library presentation and several other readers enjoyed it too."
2,A mostly sterile academic debate,"I bought this book expecting a real effort to understand the impact and the dynamic of the recent representation of gays in the media. Statistics show how important the visibility of homosexuals has been for shifting public opinion. Well ... you won't find any endeavor of this sort in the this book. This collection of articles is merely a descriptive to moralistic commentary, put into some complicated academic and semi-activist style. The level of their analysis is desperately shallow. Unless you are looking for a purely descriptive commentary on TV shows (like Queers as Folk, Will and Grace...) that cast gay characters, the book you are looking for has not been written yet. If yes, please let me know. Overall, this book was a true disappointment."
5,A RARE TREAT,"This fine recording showcases the Westminster Cathedral Choir while it was still directed by David Hill, who used restraint and subtlety (which, unfortunately, were traded in for a much too forward--close to yelling--style by his successor). In particular, the choir's performance of Alonso Lobo's ""Versa Est in Luctum"" is sung very movingly and at a much slower pace than any other version I have heard (including the Tallis Scholars, who omit most of the emotion as they rush through the piece). The choir really digs in and luxuriates in the dark rich sonorities of this great music. A rare treat as are all the other Hyperion recordings of this choir that were made when--and only when--it was under the direction of David Hill. Especially recommended are their recordings of the ""Requiem"" by Tomas Luis de Victoria and the ""Missa Papae Marcelli"" by Palestrina."
4,Attention all singers! Finzi is a master at setting texts.,"Gerald Finzi's song-cycles are the most celebrated works in his small and carefully composed output. His settings of poetry by Thomas Hardy, not easy words to tackle, stand alongside the similarly-fused art of Faure & Verlaine or Wolf & Morike. The eager student of English song should discover in Finzi something much more exciting than Quilter's or Head's efforts; he and Vaughan Williams are clearly at the apex of early-20thC. songwriting in the English tradition. I can think of few works that appeal in such a pastoral, largely diatonic way, yet prove their worth as well-wrought compositions. This is Finzi all over. Try his choral music by the Finzi Singers on Chandos as well."
4,Speedo 2 piece swim suit,This is a great bikini. It is very sporty and you don't have to worry that your top is coming off when you dive in the water. Also I nice feature is that you can adjust the waist with a string that hides and is not noticable.
2,Not what I expected.,"I thought my child who is eight would enjoy this toy, but it's for much younger children. It's also much lower-tech than it appears. Not worth the money."
1,"It's a bible for ruminant nutritionists, but...","I have been very upset about this book from the first page to the end. This is the book only the author can read. I would like to see the updated version can be more readable. However, the author's knowledge on this topic is nquestionable. My suggestion is looking for another book for serious reading and putting this one on the desk for reference."
4,Powerfull Voice & Music,"Best Blues/Rock singer in the country today,actually this is his second album ,follows GRAND PAS PLACE (1995),produced by the best guitar player in Brazil,Robertinho do Recife.His style remenbers Walter Strout,SRV with a BAD CO. Blues/Rock edge.He just released a new cd called BOOTLEG(2003)his best album.If youre looking for powerfull R&B,Blues/Rock oriented ,you wont find anything better in Brazil ,check it out....."
3,Leave the vegetables alone!,"Joe's father loves his garden and looks forward to the annual garden show where he will show his tomatoes to win the blue ribbon. Their neighbour is equally devoted. Joe's father also loves lawn ornaments. One day he purchases 2 ugly garden gnomes.The next day someone has destroyed most of their neighbour's melons, the ones that should've entered the garden competition. More vegetables are destroyed and Joe gets blamed. Joe decides to find out who's behind.This was not a very good Goosebumps story. The plot was a bit too far out, and the story could've been better. The vegetables were among the most exciting part of the story."
3,Ok? i guess..,"This book, was about a boy trying, to prove that two werid lawn orinates came to life, and are causing all the trouble going on. So mainly he goes on a little adventure, with his sister mindy and his bestfriend moose, cant forget about his dog buster also. I personality didn`t really like the book. If anything its for younger kids."
4,Keep off their grass!,SOMEONE'S BEEN STALKING IN MY GARDEN!Two pink flamingos. A whole family of plaster skunks. Joe Burton's dad loves those tacky lawn onaments. But then he brings home two ugly lawn gnomes. And that's when the trouble starts.Late at night. When everyone's asleep.Someone's creeping in the garden. Whispering nasty things.Smashing melons. Squashing tomatoes.No way two dumb old lawn ornaments could be causing all the trouble.Is there?
1,This was s'posed to be...............scary?!,"I HATED this book!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't understand how it even got published!!! Heck, if I were the main character, I wouldn't be scared!!!!!!!!!! Puh-leez!!!!!!!! The main caracter and his frend are just big fat, losery chickens!!!!!!!!!!! Bock Bock BOCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I woldn't even think about buying ths horribly cheezy and sorry book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Keep off their grass!,"Honestly this book was more funny than scary. But it was it was still a pretty good book. Not much action happened though but I liked the scenes with the gnomes. I really liked it when the gnomes were shouting ""Tickle them! Tickle them! Tickle them!"" ""Bounce them! Bounce them! Bounce them!"" ""Dribble them! Dribble them! Dribble them!"" etc. I rated it four stars but it's still a good book. I'd recommend it you were looking for a slightly humorous and creepy tale."
5,Very good bettery on my Canon Rebel,"I have been using this bettery for 3 months. I'm very satisfied. My canon rebel never runs out of bettery with it.PS: I don't shoot with a powerful flash, so I don't know about that situation."
1,Poor battery charge,I am frustrated that a battery taken directly out of the charger at full indicates nearly discharged when inserted into the battery (first charge out of the container). This does not act like any of the previous 4 Canon batteries I have owned for my camera.
5,Canon Battery,"This is an excellent battery that powers my Canon 5D camera very well. Although I haven't tested it against the spec for how many shots I can get from it, I've been very impressed with the longevity of it's charge."
4,Additional Battery for Canon PowerShot G3 Digitial Camera,"I bought this battery in addition to the Canon CB-5L Battery Charger for BP511-BP535 Series Batteries. The Canon G3 camera, which I bought about 2 years ago, came with one battery that must be charged inside the camera as it didn't ship with an external charger.This bacame a pain, as with one battery, you cannot use the camera whilst it is charging. Hence external charger and an additional battery.New and fully charged, one battery's charge lasted 3 days with frequent use."
4,More juice is always better.,"I bought 4 of these and the container is easy to tell that its genuine, the container has canon halograms on it.So it makes you fell save.The terminal cover has a hole that you can invert to indicate if its full or drained out."
1,bogus batts!,I ordered three of these thinking they were Canon Batteries. They do not hold a charge and were in mock Canon packaging. I later learned Canon seals their batteries with a hologram sticker. I regret that i threw away the packaging and did not know of the warning and that DID NOT read these reviews. Since I bought these in Feb of 2011 I am pretty much stuck with these weak excuses for batteries.TEUPhotoTrainer.com
4,"Great, but overpriced","This is a great battery pack that gets great life, but the non-Canon brand BP511's are just as good and a fraction of the cost. You won't be disappointed in the performance of the battery, but you'll be paying extra for the Canon brand."
1,Ordered this but got a knock-off brand,"Ordered this Canon brand name (OEM) battery. The order was filled by Eforcity. The item I received was a knock-off brand with no manufacturer name on it. I contacted them asking for the item I ordered. Instead they just apologized for the ""inconvenience"" and processed a refund. If I use this battery then I void the manufacturer warranty. There's no way I'll take a risk like that. This is false advertising aimed at fooling those that don't know better. I already left seller feedback but since this item is still advertised I decided to include my feedback here. Buyer beware."
5,Spare Battery Saves the Day,"I put off purchasing one of these for quite some time thinking that I could manage. Well, all it took was running out of gas in the middle of shooting. I told myself it would never happen, but I was wrong. I've had it for a short time but it has saved me more than once having the spare battery. Don't be an idiot like me, buy one for back-up."
4,A Battery is a Battery is a Battery?,Have been advised by friends to go for 3rd party batteries with bigger capacity at a lower cost. But the one I got turned out to be a dud. Unable to hold charge after 3 cycles. At least this one is still going strong.
3,Did not last long,"I have this battery in my digital Rebel and I do take many photos with it. I have had it for 18 months and it is now showing signs of dying. I will buy a new canon battery but it does seem that the original should have lasted longer. My camera is used professionally, all canon components, and overall the battery has been fine,just a little short lived."
5,Spares,I needed a spare pair of batteries for my Canon 5D dslr. These batteries are working perfectly for me. Excellent!
1,Sounds like a fake to me,500-1000 shots for an authentic Canon battery is not good which leads me to believe this is a fake. My Canon battery that came with my 20D would get me at least 1200-1500 shots at a wedding even after using it for 6 years and still have power left over. Unfortunately another photographer whom I was working an event at in Schaumburg stole mine while I had it charging and stuck his cheap knock off battery in my charger. Protect your authentic Canon batteries because they are worth every penny!
5,Canon BP511A,I ordered this battery to replace a Cannon BP511 which died after 6 years or use. I have not used this battery as of yet. However I have used the BP511A battery for about 5 years in a Cannon 10D camera with no problems.
3,always have a backup,"I have been in so many situations where I couldn't use my expensive camera because I didn't have an extra battery, do yourself a favor and get one."
1,Order Never arrived!,"Never arrived after ordering, while I noticed it was posted cheaper in the price .."
5,My original battery lasted 4+ yrs. Makes sense to buy original,"May be a little expensive but remember when we used to buy film and process? If this is the only incremental cost to taking pictures, and I have taken thousands in the 4+ years I had the original before it went out, I figure it is best to just get another original Canon.Bought an off-brand for my camcorder and wished I hadn't. Only lasted 1 year."
5,Excellent,"What can I say, it's a battery, but I guess even batteries have issues. This one works great - I use it in my Canon 5d."
5,It works,Don't waste your time with the fake batteries. I bought a Targus clone for my 20D and the battery died within a year. Targus support is ignoring me. I should have just stuck with Canon batteries from the very start.
4,Lasts for a long time,"This lasts for a longer time than I though possible on a Canon 30D, taking say 100 shots over a couple of hours per day it has lasted for about a week... I haven't really used the built-in flash but I do review every shot on the built in screen. It recharges in a couple of hours.It's still a good idea to get a spare battery, just in case... I didn't feel comfortable buying a no-name battery for such a great camera; the bottom line is I did get over the initial sticker shock and this will prove to be good value for money if it continues like this in the medium and longer term."
1,Not suitable for Canon EOS 50D,I bought this battery as a backup for my Canon EOS 50 D. Do not buy this battery! It barely fits into the space designed for the battery and taking it our again becomes a major operation as the built in spring mechanism is not strong enough to push the battery up again. I doubt that is is an original Canon battery. Unfortunately I discovered this only after the return deadline had expired.
3,Dissappointing!,I have more than seven of these batteries all less than a few years old. Now each charge lasts ridiculously little.
2,Beware of misrepresenting photograph!,"The photo in the product description portrays a genuine Canon battery. The item received was a cheap knock-off! I can understand the price discrepancy, but it is up to the seller to make sure listing details are accurate."
2,cannot hold a full charge,Out of the box (just received) they cannot hold a full charge. Camera never advances beyond the LED and never progresses to blinking or even steady color. Feel kind of ripped off.
4,Canon Battery review,The battery seems to work better than original with a longer life than the battery that came with my Canon 5D. The true test will be over time when the battery life degrades with age.
1,told not reliable by a auto parts salesperson,I tested a battery that I bought with this. Testing each cell showed each cell to be in the low fair range. So I took the battery back where I bought it and they tested it with their equipment which showed the battery to be good? So the battery is either good or the salesman is lying? The battery red light is still coming on in the car????
4,I'd lost my other copy...,"I had been wanting to reread this story, as I do all of her books, but my collection of Tepper's paperbacks disappeared when I moved."
4,Fabulous!!,The first hundred pages are a little difficult as you get used to the style and setting. But the rest of the story is well worth the initial struggle. Highly imaginative with great insights into societal pressures. A very rewarding experience.
4,Excellent themes and philosophies. Mediocre adventure.,"This book was fantastic in terms of presenting ideas. It was meaty, thick, you can really sink your teeth into it. You can *learn* from this book, about sexuality, gender issues, dancing, environmentalism. It's chock full of facts, thoughts, philosophies. I loved it for this reason. As far as its descriptive detail it is not an evocative story... No brilliant or rich imagery, no character you completely fall in love with, no plot that makes you breathless with expectation. Those aspects are present, and fairly solid, but not extraordinary. I would recommend this book to those who take an interest in the world-building and sociological aspects of science fiction, and predict it will be something of a disappointment for those looking primarily for a ""great ride."""
4,Superb...,"An answer to the grimly misogynistic cultures in Raising the Stones, and similar in theme to her early Lands of the True Game/Jinian series, this astonishing novel weaves together a society that no matter how flawed, works. She also lampoons society rather viciously, sometimes amusingly, sometimes very darkly."
2,Disappointing,"I actually really enjoyed this book for a while, the ideas presented were stimulating and thought provoking and the characters were, for the most part, interesting. But the story lost something towards the end. As if the author didn't know how to express what she wanted to say. The ending itself was extremely disappointing, I've rarely felt so let down by a book as I was by this one."
4,I liked it but for the typos,"I quite like this book. I've read a lot of her other books about 15 years ago so I can't really compare them to this one anymore. However, the amount of typos in this Kindle version is unbelievable. On one page alone a guys named was spelled 3 different ways, none of them being the same name even. I really hope the paperback book isn't riddled with this amount. I find it distracting with all the missing or incorrect letters in words."
2,A little too extreme...,"A note that I would give this book a 2.5 Stars if that were an option.I first became fascinated by Sheri S. Tepper's writing after reading the surreal _Singer From the Sea._ I first heard about this book mentioned in reviews of Singer. Let me just say that it's not nearly as fascinatingly-written as Singer was, and several scenes of sadomasochism (among other gross items) rather ruined a good deal of it.The plot is good enough but the beginning skips around a lot. There's several subplots and sub-major characters that don't all come together until of the book is over and done with. I did enjoy the reversed society where women are more important than men. That's definitely something of a ""new"" concept.Over all, read this only if you don't mind occasionally disturbing scenes. If you really want to read a good book by Sheri S. Tepper, I'd suggest _Singer From the Sea._"
3,Too much Tepper?,"Perhaps I have read too many of Tepper's books now. I found ""Six Moons Dance"" just a bit too formulaic, a bit too much like everything else she has written in the last ten years, without the usual spark of inventiveness that normally lifts Tepper's books above the run of the mill.I just didn't get that spark from this book. All the usual Tepper elements were there: the suitably bleak distant future setting, the bad guys complete with physical deformities and sexual deviances, the topsy-turvey gender system - and a couple of political issues thrown in to make better citizens of us. But there wasn't much else, and as a veteran of some ten or so Tepper novels, I found that wasn't enough to keep me enthusiastic.My advice: Buy it if you're a collector or if you can't get it from a library. Otherwise, spend your money on one of Tepper's better books. Beauty, for example."
2,Poor editing and Deus Ex-Machina rule in this book.,"Ms. Tepper starts with an interesting premise and an interesting puzzle. Unfortunately somewhere around two thirds of the way through the book, the puzzle becomes evident and the climax which happens later seems forced and not really a true climax. This book could have used several rounds with an editor. It appears to this reader that the book got read by someone who pointed out a few flaws causing Ms Tepper to make some changes. Those changes were not reflected everywhere in the book.Once again Ms. Tepper insists on having a moral too her story and rather than leaving it to the reader to pull the moral from the story, she insists on hitting the reader over the head with it. Whether you agree or not with Ms. Tepper, I find having a position forced makes for unnatural and uncomfortable reading."
1,"You Pay Ninety-nine Cents, You Get About Five Cents Worth.","This book is a great disappointment and a vast wasteland. It's TERRIBLE. I bought it because I read 'The Companions' by the same author and THAT was a great book. I was expecting something along the same lines but, instead, I got rubbish. I got incomprehensible, verbose, inane gibberish. I got feminist lunacy. I got a Dempsey Dumpster. I had to struggle to stay interested enough to read the first four chapters. I used speed-reading to browse through about six more. Then I gave up. The book got less and less interesting; more and more useless, stupid and trite. What did the author do? Toss a bunch of flowery words into the hopper, spin it up to max rpm and let it spew a hodgepodge out the chute? Most likely.Don't waste your money - don't waste your time. This book is an insult to science fiction. If a book burning were to be held this would be the kindling."
2,not believable,"The history and reasoning Tepper gives for how the female-dominant society came about is hardly believable. This social structure (as she has it set up) could not maintain itself. However, Tepper is a very good writer, and if you can blindly accept this society, the book makes for a good read."
3,Okay.,"Gives some insight into the character. You can tell this is just another mini-movie from a Blu-ray edition which has a lot of bonus features. It was worth the free price, since I enjoyed the movie and really like Charlize Theron as an actress."
2,boring sales piece,"Charlize Theron is a wonderful actress, but this was boring beyond belief. Start out with a bad (truly bad) movie, and then put out interviews to try to sell the really bad movie. This really has no value. I gave it two, simply because I like Charlize Theron."
4,"good, but...","i, too, found out about big sir because i was such a big fan of pet. the self-titled CD is hard to find (try half dot com). big sir is excellent and both of their CDs have their standout tracks (especially the cover songs on this album!). i like the instrumentation on the big sir albums, but prefer lisa's vocals back when she was screaming in pet."
3,"GOOD FILM, POOR PRINT!!!!!",The DVD I viewed is from Miracle Pictures. The print is quite worn and is just chock-full of splices. The best print I know of is the Hal Roach VHS. The VHS is easier viewing as the splices there are do not interrupt dialogue or the flow of the film.
2,Charlie Chan - The Golden Eye,"I am also a collector of all the Charlie Chan movies and have waited a long time for the Roland Winters series to be released - This is indeed a rare issue and it is mostly easy to watch and the sound is good - Roland Winters does a good job as Charlie but it is Mantan Moreland that, (as usual), steals the show - I hope that TCM will listen to the public (doubtful) and release the final Chan films as they might be very surprised at the public response -"
3,TV Series,I am a CC fan and have all the movies that I could find and enjoy them as I remembered them from my childhood. The TV series is not of the quality I would wish for and the sound is poor. I have viewed other TV series of this era and the quality is usually disappointing also. I guess I am used to the Movie actors version of CC and J carol Nash isn't as good in my opinion. There are alot of episodes and it will take time to go through them. I am happy that I purchased the set.
3,"""Black Magic' AKA ""Meeting at Midnight""","This is a very good,classic Chan movie with Mantan Moreland stealing a lot of scenes. My only disappontment was that I already have the story in a now very scratchy vhs as ""Meeting at Midnight"" and thought ""Black Magic"" was a newly discovered story.The Charlie Chan Chanthology (The Secret Service / The Chinese Cat / The Jade Mask / Black Magic / The Scarlet Clue / The Shanghai Cobra)"
1,Golden Eye w/Charlie Chan,"One of WORST movies (productions) I've ever seen. Plot okay re gold mine, but scenes so dark, most of them, that can't tell what is going on. For that price, DO NOT BUY. I would not buy even for my collection if $1.00 - it is recorded that BADLY. I have asked for refund. ALso, NEED TRACKING on all your products, Quick N Easy -- not good to not track, as if someone doesn't get, YOUR loss. NOT GOOD SALESMANSHIP or policy to not track. Will never order from you people again if I don't get satisfaction for my return of S&H; & Label and full cost of movie o movies. Not my error. You need new master to record from--this is VERY POOR.Cecy Ivie"
4,The Golden Eye,"Although I like Sidney Toler as the best Charley Chan, Roland Winters did a creditable job. The plot in The Golden Eye movie was much better than a lot of the previous Chan movies. I wouls recommned it for Chan affectionatos."
1,Oh you limeys !,It never ceases to amaze me that you Brits eat this horrific dog food-paste.No wonder you lost the revolutionary war.It's clear from you eating Marmite and Vegamite that you never deserved those colonies anyway.
5,"a rose by any name is still a rose, good stuff !","I have Marmite on toast every morning. Although I have been told by an Australian friend that Marmite is not up to the standards of Vegemite, I cannot tell the difference. An English friend tells me Marmite is better. Go figure.:) I love it and make certain to never run out of Marmite. This is one of those: you either love it or hate it, things perhaps. I've been even told it's healthy for me *gasp*. Regardless, it's a good way to start my day."
4,cool for girls,"I bought for my eleven year old, she going to middle school and she wanted something groovy. She hasnt used it yet but the bag is much nicer than it looks on the picture, besides that the size is perfect."
5,spiders and snakes,"This is a really fun little set of stories about soldiers in a war fought across time and space. The soldiers are recruited from many places and times - recruited to one side or the other, serving either the Spiders or the Snakes...without really knowing who or what those names really mean, or what the ultimate goal of either side is...I guess the author was inspired by theater, and there are great elements of that. Great characters, great setting, great concept."
4,Very Good ;),"This book went very in-depth into issues specifically relating to women in college, not just the token ""anorexia"" or ""bulimia"" sections that are found in most general college survival books. Much appreciated."
2,good but HETEROSEXIST,"This book contains some very useful information for women college students, but fails to be all inclusive. Perhaps, a better title would be The Heterosexual College Woman's Handbook. Despite attempts to use gender/sex neutral terms, the authors fail many times, leaving the bisexual or lesbian reader feeling minimized and alienated."
4,Based on real life,I have only read half of it but it is truely based on real life. It's about two young teens that fall in love and get married because they're going to have a baby. They run away to New York and have a hard time.
5,PB and J..Great Game!,"Bought this for my daughter a few months ago and we loved playing this game as a family!! We loved stealing from each other's sandwiches and placing flyies on the sandwiches as well! Great interactive learning game and the illustration of the card's and the whole lunch box itself, so beautiful and easy to take any where. Def recommend....we are going to purchase the other games just like it!!"
5,Excellent product for any skin type,Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. I also use it for a face to wash off a mask residue.
3,"An OK product, could be better","Got this for camping with the family, worked great the first year we had it, no real complaints. Just don't fill it up more than half way and be mindful of sharp objects.Now that we are in the second camping season, the material has become brittle. Two cracks have developed in the wash basin, both are ""fixed"" with duct tape. Don't see us finishing the season out with it, will prolly go in the trash soon."
2,Coleman PVC Double Wash Basin,"I bought this a few weeks back for use on a cross country trip that included some car camping. The first time this was taken out of the package it was purchased in was moments before it was used at the camp site. After it's first use we collapsed it up and packed it away. The next time we used this we immediately it started leaking. Upon closer inspection I found that the basin had developed tears at the bottom seams where the basin folds when you collapse it down for travel use.I'm a little disappointed that this would happen this quickly after use, but I also understand that this sort of thing happens from time to time. Since I'm still in the midst of my vacation I'll have to find time to reach out to Coleman to see inquire what or how they'll address this."
2,It is just not durable enough,"It only lasted one Camping trip. The second trip it developed a leak at a place where it folds. Yes it folds for compact storage. I guess folding is a good idea to have it compact but not if the material can't take it. It's very thin material. I would have paid more for a durable one. I threw it in the trash at the camp grounds as it's not worth getting it replaced under warranty.We are now using a Rubbermaid 18qt clear storage box, we use for transporting camping stuff, as our sink. It is made of Polypropylene, it's tough, worked in an emergency and now it is the main solution. I bet I paid $10 for it at a local hardware store."
5,quite useful,"So far, I'd have to say this is a great product for camp cleaning. Its held up quite well for me and I've gotten much use out of it on my last camping trip."
4,My review,"This simple little sink was absolutely great for a camping trip. We heat hot water and pour in each side, wash and rinse. Held up great and makes it so easy to wash dishes right there at the camp table. Everyone raved about it, another little enhancement to our Coleman Camp site which consists of Coleman Stoves, ten (1) Coleman Instant Tents in our group, Coleman air mattresses (double high queen), and lanterns and LED string lights."
2,Leaky dish basin!,I used this product once and it is leaking in 2 spots. It also is very small and does not look as big as the picture.
1,Pretty useless,"This little plastic creation is not big enough to wash dining ware of any sort, especially pots. I use it to store things."
1,Worthless item,"My husband used this when camping. After the hot water was poured in, the basin became very soft and pliable. After about half way through washing dishes the first time, a hole came in the rinse side. He did not get one whole load of dishes washed. He expected better from Coleman. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT!!"
4,Just what I needed,Now that the kids have move out we sold the mini van and downsized to a tiny two door hatchback. This meant that we had to downsize our camping gear. The one thing that we thought would be hard to downsize were the wash basins. They are just so big to pack....or so we thought!! Thank goodness we found the Coleman folding double wash basin. It folds flat and pops up to a reasonable size for doing our camp dishes.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the plastic carry bag is as small as they could possibly make it which makes putting the basin away rather difficult. Too bad they didn't spare a bit more on a decent carry bag.
1,Go Big or Stay Home,"I really despised this Coleman PVC sink and it now lives in my bin of rejected and unloved camping gear. I gave it a chance, but it is too small to be useful and very unstable. With hot water, it feels like a child's pool toy that's been left out in the sun. It was a waste of money. It won't last and will soon end up in a landfill. There are far better products out there.Seattle Sports Pack Sinksare larger and tougher. I use two of them when car camping. It costs more, but it works and makes the whole camping experience that much more enjoyable. Problem solved. You don't need to settle for this chintzy and cramped little piece of junk. Spend a little more for something that works and that you can depend on. Go big or stay home."
5,Good value for the money,"I did not have any problems with this standing up or holding water. I do know from the type of plastic it is made out of, I would not use hot or even very warm water to wash dishes.I am glad I found this. I would also keep the paperboard so you can use the plastic sleeve bag or I am thinking of making a fabric bag to put it in."
2,Small and cheap,"I bought this for my scouts, it was far too small to wash anything bigger than silverware and one of the legs broke before then even filled it with water the first time. Since they were also limited to cold water because the material gets soft when on contact with heat, I decided to go back to my 5-gal bucket wash system."
4,Great item,"I go camping about six times a year. We go to the same spot, and have frustrated ourselves with washing all our cooking gear and utensils. I finally invested a few dollars and it made all the difference."
2,"Like others, arrived with a hole in the corner","Arrived with a small tear in the corner (not on a seam) so one side didn't hold water -- out-of-the-box. I need to figure out how to repair this type of vinyl anyway; my soft-sided portable food storage bag also has a tear. Therefore, I won't return it to Amazon."
4,"not very stable, but worked","The sides of this don't hold up to being filled with water. my camper has a small sink and washing dishes was hard. So i use this and make the kids wash the dishes outside when we camp. it works well enough considering it's a camping tool, but i would be better if it held the water better."
2,Leaked on first use,"I was excited to use this sink this past weekend on a camping trip; however, the product failed to function as promised. I unfoldeded the sink, filled it with water and immediately it began to leak. The sink hit the garbage can on the way out of the campsite."
2,Useless,"Way too small, it doesn't even hold a single dinner plate. I hate to throw it away but that's probably what I shall do."
5,Smart Buy,"After my last camping trip, the site didn't have water, so hauling the water jug is annoying. Glad to have had the soapy water and clean water, saved a lot of time, effort, and water. Awesome buy!"
1,Leaky PVC Double Wash Bag,"This Basin is a piece of junk. It leaked the first time I used it. It is almost impossible to fold back to original size for storage, but not a big issue since it is only good for one use."
3,"Just ""ok""","Used it for camping, but wish it was a little bigger. When filled on both sides, the soapy side would seep into the clean side, so I would have to re rinse. We had it stationed on the ground, not really a flat surface available when you are roughing it. Other then that, it defeated its purpose"
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"This was such a waste of money. The first time I went to use it, it leaked all over the place. I through it away. Not even worth sending it back to get a refund. RIP OFF"
2,Seam broke 2nd day of light use,"When the wash basin arrived, I was a little skeptical at the size. I was pleasantly surprised when we used it on our camping trip this past weekend that it was larger than I expected and I was able to wash full size plates and a frying pan without a problem. The fact that it folded up so compact was the reason I purchased it - that's one less big thing we had to bring camping. One the second day, after breakfast, I went to fill the sinks and water rushed from side a to side b...the seam had broken. So much for that compact item in our camping gear."
3,Get the Seville Concert by John Williams instead...,"if you want to hear Concerto for Lute in D Major the way it should be played. As I can recall I sought out another version of the D major concerto as I was displeased with the superfluous instrumentation (authentic as it may be) on this disc--especially on the renowned RV 93 section. Williams plays this part cleanly and brightly, without cloying strings in the background."
4,Good Idea...,"I enjoyed this film, I picked it up last year in 2009 at a horror con in Chicago from the filmmakers. I feel that it is not meant to be true horror film but rather a horror comedy type of flick. The main character in the film is rather funny from the way he does things. Some dude has these demonic things living in one of his apartments that he has somewhat became buddies with. The demonic creatures kills the tenets before the owner can collect the months payment...I like it when the cops come to investigate as they are just waiting for the landlord to slip up and make a mistake...the landlord always gets stuck cleaning up the mess that the demons leave behind (most of the time). I would recommend this film as I have seen nothing like it before."
2,Too thin,"It does what it says, but the plastic grids in the middle are way too thin and break very easily...and yes I know it is temporary fencing!"
1,"does not fit 12"" laptops!!","i bought this for my dell inspiron 700 m, which is 11.5"" long. The case claims that it is 14"", but it is totally not..it is barely 13"" .Anyway, it claims to fit most 12"" laptops, but it didn't fit mine, so I had to return it. 1 star for time wasted."
1,Garbage,"This book was given to me and I wish I knew who gave it to me because I'd give it back. This book shouldn't even be considered a book, it should be considered kindling. No joke, this book is impossible to read and follows no path of literacy or mental comprehension whatsoever. This ""book"" should be removed from this site and destroyed."
1,Diarrhea of a Kind,"got this piece of garbage at a work seminar. seems like some old rich guy was looking to push this pretentious waste of tree and come off as some literary master. Limited number of hand signed copies? what only 2 billion? everyone gets a hand signed copy. this guy has too much time on his hands.also, would it have killed him to use a full sentence occasionally? night hot. me? trying to forget... what the hell? did the stuttering black kid in that one story write this?do yourself a favor and save the two hours on the john you would have used to read this and get a Maxim."
3,Godbody,"I remembered this book from my much younger days and thought I'd read it again now. It was a lot more impressive in my 30s than now in my 60s. Sturgeon can write, no doubt about it. But the Christ figure embodied in the hero, Godbody, is a lot more believable to the young than to the more mature reader. The message of eros instead of agape loses its charm to the elderly reader."
5,Godbody is a life-changing book,"This book opened my mind and blew my useless prejudices away. I read it shortly after reading Heinlein's _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and the combined effects of the two books made the world blossom for me. I understood love, and I understood honesty, and I had Sturgeon and Heinlein to thank for it.Sturgeon's book tenderly shows us that there is humanity and value buried even in the most twisted personality. He shows us the value of empathy. I strongly recommend Godbody, especially for Christians or recovering Christians."
5,"Arnold Chamber Music, Vol 2","This is simply an older release of the identicalThe Chamber Music of Malcolm Arnold, Vol. 2, still currently available. Why would anyone want to pay an outrageously inflated price to a reseller?"
5,good book,"My husband used this book all through school, gave it to a friend, and they used it through school as well. The book held up wonderfully, was rugged enough to carry around everywhere, and had very good information."
1,Don't get your hopes up...,"This game is not a high quality item. The screen is *very* small, and it is hard to see the actual pieces on the screen. The stylus must be used for all operations, so plan on keeping track of it - the storage slot for the stylus is on the back, but has little, if any, holding power.Overall, this would be an OK toy at the ""sub-ten-dollar"" price range. If you are spending more than that, plan on being a bit disappointed."
4,Romace reader,"I enjoyed the book, but felt they left the relationship unfinished, would have liked more interaction between June and the mystery man she helped, would have liked it if they'd told more of their relationship and not so much of the towns relationship with the doctor."
1,Most Boring Trilogy I Have Ever Read,I loved the Virgin River Trilogy so I bought all of The Grace Valley novels at once. What a mistake!! I read this one (the first in the Series) and was sorely disappointed. I had hopes that the other two would be better. But they were not. I skip read through the Second book in the Series and read about three chapters in the last Book of the Series before discarding it. Don't waste your money on this Trilogy.
3,"If you liked the Virgin River books, this will disappoint...","Having just read the entire Virgin River series (except for V.R. Xmas), I was hoping this would be more of the great characters, fantastic settings, & get the kleenex box out, wonderful stories. It hopped from one mediocre plot to another, I really didn't get attached, or even particularly like any of the main people, and frankly I couldn't wait for it to end. I won't give it lower than a ""3"" as Robyn Carr's worst book is better than tons of other one's I've read-- but I buy books based on customer ratings a lot, and just want people know this isn't Virgin River-- in any way, shape, or form."
3,Pleasant read; Easy to walk away from,"After reading the Virgin River series, I couldn't wait to read the Grace Valley series. What a difference. I do not recommend the Grace series. They go from slow to standing still. I was so bored reading this trilogy. Save your money. Also, for me, there was way too much doctor and nurse and cop stuff. If I have to read the name Tom Toopeek again I will scream."
4,Deep in the Valley,I love Robyn Carr's portrayal of book Grace Valley and Virgin River. Her characters are rich in character and make you want to believe they really exist. Looking forward to more of her books.
5,Couldn't Stop Reading,"I'm a new reader of Robyn Carr. I had read a couple from the Virgin River Series, which were great. Tut this was my first for the Grace Valley Series. I promptly went and ordered the other 2 books in this series. I'm hooked!"
2,Good but fragile,I am an avid tennis player that has used Bolle tennis sunglasses for years. I have never had one break until now. I tried the first pair and it broke within days. No problem rreturning for a new pair. The new pair broke wihin a week. I like the kickback because it is lighter and doesn't seem to fog as much as the others. I will soon return the broken pair for a new one one more time because I can't believe that they are that fragile. If the third one breaks I will ask for a refund.
3,light weight ..,glasses are decent for the price..only complaint is.. they get wider on use.other than that.. pretty nice glasses.
5,Great glasses,Very lightweight and love the look! You still have peripheral view coverage even though they look smaller. They don't fog up as my vigilante ones.
5,Works great,I see really well into the sun with these. I can see the fuzz strands on the ball from 10 feet away! Does not interfere with depth perception. No problem wearing a hat over them. Sweat will get on the lenses some times. Not super sturdy but shouldn't break if you're moderately careful with them.
5,Cristina is great,"Murmurios is a great CD. There's no better fado singer than Crisina Branco, really. Listen to Fado Perdicao, listen to Murmurios, listen to As certezas do meu mais brilhante amor... The melancholy, the heartfelt sorrow, and still, the joy, it all fits and creates a wonderful sense of wanting to be in Lisbon, or with Cristina (whom I've had the pleasure of seeing perform myself), or whatever. When in trouble, seek comfort in Murmurios (or her other CD's, like Post Scriptum, or Cristina in Holland, although I don't know if it's available elsewhere). Cristina Branco is great and the world better know it (and soon will)."
5,Buy this album!,"If you like Tech N9ne this is a must! Skatterman & Snug Brim have a sic style with bangin beats, the whole cd is good w/ appearences by Tech N9ne, Kutt, B.G. Bulletwound, Big Krizz Kaliko and the rest of the Strange Music crew, don't miss out on this one!"
2,Not for my horses,"I recently bought Defy the Fly for our horses. I got the smaller size collar and found it large for even the 16.2h gelding. It definitely smells like it would repel flies but he had it off within a few days. I found it ripped, not unsnapped and lying on the ground. This product may work fine if you get a good fit and it stays on. I won't be buying anymore."
3,Not really the Professional's Book,"This is more of a book geared toward beginners and enthusiasts. Too often the comments are very general in character -- under anatomy, for instance, the author tells us that koi have all the usual internal organs one would expect -- and the author frequently refers the reader to other publications. There are numerous very nice color photographs and the book is easy to read. It just scratches the surface, however, and so is perhaps not aptly named."
4,"Pretty book, but has some weakenesses","I love reading this book, for the tons of photos of different strains of koi. It also has a surprising amount of information on designing and building koi ponds, pond plants, anatomy/physiology, history, breeding, etc. But it does lack detailed information on some topics such as diseases and water chemistry. Statements such as ""koi thrive between a pH of 6.5 and 8.0"" are a good start, but a bit simplistic for the serious koi keeper."
4,Soft and cute frog but can be pricey,My son loves his taggies blanket and I bought this frog being it's a taggie and it is a very soft stuffed animal. He loves to play with the blanket and likes to use it as a pillow being it is large compared to him. It seems to be a bit pricey depending on some of the sites where it is available. But I still really like this frog and so does my son.
3,last season,"It was a shame to see the girls leave my living room. I generally enjoyed the seoson, however I wish there would have been more of a resolution between Loreli and Luke. I guess I just wanted more Gilmore Girls!"
2,Unhappy With This Season,"Gilmore Girls has been one of my all time favorite shows. I loved the witty language and banter and just the whole plot line. However, I was upset with this season. A lot of the fire was gone from the show and I just could never see where the show was going. I imagine it would have been 10 times better if Amy Palladino had stayed with the show if her demands had been met. My least favorite episode probably was the last. After Logan proposes you hear absolutely nothing about what happened except Rory said no. I loved those two together. The only good thing about the whole season was that Lorelai and Luke got back together."
5,On Second Thought,"I deleted my original review because admittedly I had just finished Season 6 and was so ticked off after watching it and by what I read on the ""spoiler"" websites so I had not actually watched Season 7. I doubt I am the first person to have done this sort of thing.Anyway, after having watched Season 7 over the course of three days I must say I am shocked by how good it was. It reminded me of seasons 2, 3, and 4 in its quality and balance. It was almost like the good old days all over again. Makes me wonder why Season 6 had to stink so bad."
1,A Banal and Saccharine Train Wreck,"I consider my 'Gilmore Girls' DVD collection to be complete without the addition of this ill conceived and incompetently written final season.It's very sad that the creator, Amy Sherman Palladino, wasn't given whatever she needed in order to stay on and oversee the conclusion of her remarkable show in the manner it deserved. Instead, she left after Season Six and took the heart and soul of 'Gilmore Girls' with her.Worst episode ever: French TwistMost obnoxious characters ever: Lucy and Olivia"
5,BRILLIANT,"This dvd was purchased for my 18 year old daughter but if the truth be known it was for me too. We love Gilmore Girls and we had a weekend of watching nothing but this box set. A real find for mother and daughter to watch. FANTASTIC, BRILLIANT. Good wholesome entertainment with the odd bit of sexual teasing and plenty of laughter, we did not want it to end."
5,love it.,"All good things must come to an end, but that doesn't mean that we can't have fun while doing it, and the final season of Gilmore Girls delivers just that."
1,Oh my word...,"Such a lame season!! Ok, just because marriage never worked for Lorelai, doesn't mean it couldn't have worked for Rory. She and Logan were obviously meant to be together, so why not marriage?Lorelai needs to pick a man and stay committed to him for more than a few weeks.April drives me crazy! She is so stinkin' annoying. All the scenes with her in them are so nerdy. Also, her mom is a selfish woman to have this custody battle with Luke.Also, Olivia and Lucy get under my skin. There is nothing interesting about them. And is the drama between them and Rory about the whole Marty situation really the best the writers of the show could come up with?If you want to be disappointed, watch the 7th season."
5,GREATNESS,I love this series and to get each season for such a small price and brand new! INCREDIBLE!!! Thank you Amazon!
1,What the...?#@!!,"I have never been so disappointed. All throughout Season 7, I cursed myself for watching what had become a watered down, slow and painful version of this previously outstanding series. But how could I not find out what happened to the most beloved characters of modern television? Season 7 had the patina of all of the limp ""WB""/""CW"" shows - colorless, with unfortunate story lines and bad dialogue that left a bad taste after the rich seasons of Stars Hollow's past. Buy Seasons 1-5, watch them again and again. But be warned - Season 6 starts to show wear around the edges, and Season 7 is like Frodo's return from his adventures. You can never go home again when writer Amy Sherman-Palladino has left the building."
1,Beyond Upset over this end to a beloved show.,"I have loved this show from the begining, and up until just now after watching the very last episode, I am Extremely sad over the end. This was such a beloved show for me. I just cant get over how this ended.Why the show ended the way it did makes no sense, it felt like everything that was going on good for these girls was being sucked out of them towards the end of this season and finally did get sucked up completely by the end credits. I just dont get it. Why was it so hard to let rory stay with Logan, why the build up between the two and then the lame break up. Huh? And Luke....? What kind of ending is this?Ugh....Can anyone end a TV Series right?"
5,Wonderful!,"This season is just wonderful! I was a little disappointed in the ending, just because it was the end of the series, and I was expecting a little more. But it is still a must see!"
4,Not the best season,"I have all the seasons of Gilmore Girls so I had to get the last season but for me it was the most disappointing season, especially the ending. I felt like I was cheated. I just could believe it ended the way it did. I guess they meant to make the last scene like the beginning of the first episode. What I like about the DVD is the extras, but that's it."
4,all you need is love.............to screw things up,"season 7 and here we go again.........the women talk more and more and get more convoluted by the episode....whilst the men get more inarticulate...........see it's just like real life. As Rory says.......women are from venus and men are bowls of soup. i find all the characters very flawed and very human, it may be set against the backdrop of a dreamy new england semi rural paradise with wacky characters but at its heart is the great human tragi-comedy of love"
5,The End to a Great Show,I thought this season was well written and I enjoyed every episode. I missed Jared Padalecki from this season and the 6th but had to buy both seasons to see how the series ended. I would definitely recommend buying all seven seasons.
3,meh,"the show rocks, but the dvds wouldnt all play on my dvd player. had to watch a few discs on my comp."
4,Gilmore girls season 7,Gilmore Girls season 7 was fantastic... I had no complications ordering it through amazon. i previously owned seasons 1 to 6 and couldnt find 7 anywhere till i came to find it on Amazon. the quality of the product was faultless and i definately will order again from Amazon. Great final season to the gilmore girls story:D
2,"the worst season, by far","I loved Gilmore Girls, especially the first 3 seasons. This season just seemed to miss Amy Sherman Palladino and even Daniel Palladino. So much of the spark and great writing seemed to have disappeared. I hated instances such as the episode early in the season where Luke tells Lorelai they never really belonged together, that she belonged with someone like Christopher...that just flew in the face of him obviously having feelings for Lorelai going back to the first episodes of the show. Or later in the season when Luke's sister basically said (I don't know which episode that was, but I'm sure someone who has posted here does) she never thought Luke and Lorelai were right for each other, which went against what she had said in previous seasons. I couldn't quite figure out why Lorelai married Christopher. I'm surprised this season got so many 5 star reviews from people here."
2,Sadly the final season was a letdown,"Gilmore Girls was an amazing show. Unfortunatly, the final season was a disaster after the creator left. It is really too bad. If you want real Gilmore Girls, watch the other seasons instead."
1,Patience,"It took forever to get to me, I ordered another season of the gilmore girls days after and I received the second one a week before this ever came in. I never got a confirmation that it will get delivered to me and I just couldn't wait, next time I will never buy from this company!"
1,One disc came scratched,"I have purchased all seven seasons of Gilmore Girls through Amazon. I have been perfectly happy with prices, service, shipping etc. On this seventh season disc 6 it came with a huge scratch. It was a Christmas gift and we wanted to watch all the discs, so we have tried to watch it several times but it skips too much... :("
1,Stupid Movie,I bought this for my mother. Every time she wants me to sit down and watch it with her I see how irratating this series is. I have never understood how this show survived to the seventh season. If you attempt to watch this get ready to blow your brains out.
4,This Sets Me FREE!!!!!,"Here is the review in a nut shell: I HATE THIS FREAKING SHOW WITH A PASSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUT...My beautiful wife loves this show. I love playing my XBOX 360Xbox 360 Pro Value Bundle, and making my wife happy. This DVD set gives me freedom, for hours, to play my gamesCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Collector's Edition, and makes my wife happy, therefore, I am happy. All thanks to a HORRIBLE show that comes on the CW. If you have a wonderful wife and you have a love for your free time, just buy this and all the 6 other CRAPPY God forsaken seasons of this TV show. Just a warning, if you don't have a second TV I wouldn't buy this, because you will be stuck watching it!Sony Bravia XBR KDL-46XBR4 46"" 1080p LCD HDTVIn closing... GILMORE GIRLS + WIFE = FREE TIME FOR THE HUBBY. FREE TIME FOR THE HUBBY + XBOX 360 = HAPPINESS. One question...WHY DO THE GILMORE GIRLS TALK SOOOOO MUCH!!!!!AEARO COMPANY #92050 PR Disp Ear Plug"
2,Is it bad that i only want this season for a few reasons?,"Lets see. This season wasnt that great. I blame the writers. Not that they weren't terrific i just think that it was too much for them to handle. They just werent ready for this. The only good events were all the stuff with Lane and Zack, everything having to do with Rory though sometimes i wanted to put her through a wall and just leave her there, and the very last episode. The moment that i most cheered about was when Lorelia and Chris divorced. I jumped, literally jumped out of my chair when that one happened. Either way it's still worth owning but serously lacks something, oh wait i know what it was that's right spunk, the fire went out in this season my friend. It went out and not in a nice subtle way but in a BAM there goes the fire kind of way."
4,All good things must come to end although it was bittersweet,I can't wait for a reunion show would the WB ever coordinate that? It would be awesome of the entire cast were guests on the Actors Studio I would pay to see Lipton interview the quick witted fast talking Gilmore Girls!
4,Different Writers,"Gilmore Girls is my favorite show. But I can tell in the last season that it was written and directed by someone else. It isn't as quick and clever as the years prior, and there were camera shots that I never saw before. Over all I still love the show and the actors that make it as good as it is."
5,One of the best TV series ever!,It is wonderful to complete our set of this series! It is definately one of the best written TV series that ever aired. We love having the entire series on DVD to watch whenever we want and not depend on re-runs. Great set to complete your own collection.
4,Gilmore Girls Season Seven,"Excellent condition of the dvds greatly added the enjoyment of the product viewing. The final series season was a bit rushed, plot-wise, and left us viewers as confused as we were in the first season."
2,What's so special about this show!,"Gilmore Girls - The Complete Seventh Season is the final season of this show and I could never figure out why everyone adored this fast-talking dramedy. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel get two stars since they are good actress' but the plots and dialogue just drive me crazy, hey I enjoy wordy people but this takes the cake, I get a migrane listening to all the mindless chatter. Love it or hate it, this show isn't for me."
5,Yeah!,I have watched this from the 1st season till I joined the army in 06 and deployed a year later not able to watch it then. Still love it!
5,Great item!,I was trying to get the entire show for a Christmas present. This one ended up being just $8. What a great deal!
3,Pales in comparison...,"If you are a Gilmore Girls fan, you will buy the 7th season anyway. It does have some of the little moments you crave, but it is just sad in comparison to previous seasons. If you've never seen Gilmore Girls, DON'T start with this one."
2,Major Disappointment!,"I have to say, i think that Gilmore Girls was one of the BEST series on television. Every season was refreshing and exciting, and this last season started off the same, but the end seemed abrupt and wrong. Rory and Logan's ended relationship seemed to me like the writer was pulling a ""That Girl"", meaning that a woman couldnt have it all, there is no reason Rory couldnt have a relationship with Logan and pursue her career. So for me, i was left a little cold at such a sorry ending for such a great show. I really hope that someday the much talked about movie comes about to fix the story!"
5,Gilmore Girls Rock,"Of course I am giving this last season of Gilmore Girls a glowing report. The show is one of the best I have ever watched. I am 33 years old and I still watch all of the re-runs on ABC Family. I was saddened when it was announced that this season seven was to be the last season. I think the storyline could have progressed on and people would have watched. But, regardless, it was an ingenious creation and television at its best. I have a five month old daughter that I can't wait to introduce Gilmore Girls to when she gets older. I have the entire collection!"
5,Gilmore Girls- 7th Season,The usual high standard for this show. I just hope the producers don't stop making episodes as my family have all 7 seasons!
5,Excellent,The DVD was just as described by the seller and arrived promptly. Thanks for the great service!
3,GG season 7,"I wasn't able to watch season 7, because it isn't coming to the family channel just yet, so I bought it. I really wanted to know what happened. I wanted to know about Rory and Logan and who Lorilei ends up with. Boy this season started off very slow and it seemed to me very dark and sad. The quick wit was not mixed in the way that it was in past seasons. But in one way they finished it with Rory becoming the very strong independent women following in her mom's foot steps.Karen"
2,Everything went downhill when Amy left...,"Wow, I can't believe all of the positive comments for this season! After Amy, the creator of the show, left the scene after season 5, things definitely went downhill. The witty dialog was gone, and the characters were completely out of their element. If you watch interviews with Amy you'll see that she IS Lorelai Gilmore. The show wasn't the same after she left. With that said, I still purchased seasons 6 and 7 to complete my collection. I watch seasons 1-5 over and over, while the last 2 seasons collect dust on my shelf. So sad to see such an amazing show go out in such a horrible way."
4,Amazing show...Terrible Ending,"Gilmore Girls is the best TV series ever created! My single mom and I would sit down weekly and watch this show ever since it started and surprisingly I was the same age as Rory. It truly mirrored our relationship. I will miss it greatly! Season 7 was better than I expected after reading reviews of it, but the last 2 episodes were horrific. My mom and I both agreed that Rory should have married Logan, and that there should have definitely been more of a reunion between Loralei and Luke. Also, the ending should have been an episode with a look into the future so you know what really happens to the characters in the end! I pray that there is a movie made to wrap up these lose ends and even reunite Rory and Logan! Everyone should watch and own the whole series!"
2,Gilmore Girls: The Complete Seventh Season,"I was very disappointed with disk one. It was scratched, had a glue like substance one the back and I was unable to watch the first four shows. I didn't want to return it because I didn't want to wait for it to be shipped back and then returned."
5,Last of the Gilmore Girls,This is the final season of the beloved Gilmore Girls series. A must have if you're part of the family!
4,gilmore fanatic,The dvd's were great the outcome not what I expected but it still ended better than most of my favorite sitcoms
4,Gilmore Girls- The Last Season,"I am, of course, a Gilmore Girls fan and so this product was extremely straightforward. I bought it to conclude my collection of seasons as well as conclude my viewing of this series. It is a great season and leaves you sad to see them go but happy with where they end up. If you like the Gilmore girls and you have shared the past 6 seasons with them then I encourage you to buy this product."
3,Ran out of gas,"I think the series basically ran out of gas. Don't get me wrong I have thoroughly enjoyed the Gilmore Girls over the past few years but Season 7 just seemed to drag on and on and the story arc could have been wrapped up in half the time. Having said that, if you enjoy the Gilmore Girls then you still need to watch how it all ends."
5,love me some Gilmore,Great quality and extra features..I love the extra features available on this and all the Gilmore Girls season disc sets.
1,It should have been Amy!,"As an avid Gilmore girls fan I was in love with this series. I watched every season, bought every DVD box set, I felt like I grew up with Rory and Loralie.The seventh season is a huge disappointment to a wonderful show. The main creator and writer of the show left after the 6th season. Season 7 the last season in the series was written by someone else and it never worked. It was not the same funny drama we had all been used to. They tried to duplicate the banter but failed miserably. The characters seemed like different people. (Especially Luke) The last episode gave us what was needed but it was all too late. A sad end to a show I loved! only watch or buy if you have not seen any other seasons or you will be disappointed."
5,"Great Product, Fast Shipping","Great shipping from Amazon, as always. Of course, the Gilmore Girls are great. A must have."
4,It's over....,Makes me so sad to see that this is the last Gilmore Girls. I am a little disappointed in the ending and I hope that they will put out a short movie to finish off or follow up on the Gilmore Girls after life...I guess I just want it to go on and on forever!
4,Gilmore Girls Season 7,"I bought this set to complete my collection of the series.Excellent show and very well produced dvd's.The extras are nice and there's been a bit of thought put in them.Still, I would've liked to have more audio commentaries on the dvd's, especially from the two starlets of the show.Aspect ratio is interesting, as I seem to recall that the later seasons on tv were widescreen, and still the dvd release is only 1.33:1. That is a disappointment.All in all a good release of a great show, too bad there aren't shows like Gilmore Girls anymore in tv... but thankfully I have the dvd's."
1,This scissors is useless!,I cannot even use this tweezers for plucking hair because it is so sharp that it cuts the hair off! I'm considering filing it down a little so it won't be so sharp.
5,One of the ten best sf novels ever,"There's not much to add to everyone else's praise. This is way up there at the top of the top ten and anybody who claims to like adult science fiction -- or good contemporary fiction for that matter --can't claim themselves educated until they've read it! 334 and Wings of Song are great, too. In fact 334 would probably also be in that top ten, too."
3,"Overshadowed by ""Flowers for Algernon""","For all its good points, Disch's ""Camp Concentration"" is and always will be overshadowed by ""Flowers for Algernon."" And for good reason. Simply put - ""Agernon"" is a more emotional story - especially in its novella form, which also prefigures Disch's book by some time.However, taken on its own, ""Camp Concentration"" has some lovely prose, ideas and exciting twists. Perhaps the problem is it could have been so much more.My favorite scene is when we first meet George. Disch manages to give us such a creepy and enigmatic meeting. If he had concentrated on the mystery of who these people were and how the drug manifests changes to their intelligence more than what they say, the book would have been better.Not much else to say that hasn't already been said. Fun, short read. Just not what it might have been."
1,One of the Worst,I read this book in 1982. I only remember it because it was hard to get through and disapointing. Maybe I need to get syphilis to understand it ...
1,Contemptible,"Sixties burnout pap. Sloppily written, confusing, obviously rushed into print. Could not finish it (read 2/3, the last 30 pages or so being a real chore). Why other reviewers like this dreadful misshpapen thing is utterly beyond me."
3,A decent read from a little known author.,"Hard core sci-fi fans will be disappointed with this seldom seen title, but it has some merit. Depsite being billed as science fiction, this book is more of a dramatic mystery with some sci-fi elements thrown in. The story revolves around the thoughts and writings of a political prisoner, during a vaguely described 'alternate timeline' World War III. The subject of experiments in human intelligence boosting, the main character interacts with other prisoners in a similar predicament, with some intriguing results. The author writes in a style which is more intelligent and introspective than most 'pulp' sci-fi novels, and may bring to mind Orwell's _1984_ in it's approach. However, Disch does not offer any real deep themes to carry the plot, so it is ultimately entertaining at best. For a little something different, this novel is a short and enjoyable work, but don't expect too much of it"
3,Not as good as The Trailer!,"Ever see a trailer for a movie ,see the film and wish it were more like the trailer. This is one of those. The blurb on the above paperback really grabbed me, so i bought the book. The book is pretty good but it IS weird .The whole thing is mainly epistolic( told in the form of letters or in this case diary entries )and breaks down the middle section when he is in a state of syphilitic dementia.In fact, it so completely captured his rambling dementia that I basically had skip over that part. On balance though, I liked it ;the ending redeemed the craziness and in fact expalined it."
3,Unrealized potential.,"After recently reading numerous classic sci-fi books penned in the 1960s I've come to the realization that many of the works of that era suffered from too much agenda and too little story. _Camp Concentration_ had the correct formula to be a greatly entertaining book, but instead the story gets mired down in blatant social finger pointing and preaching. I appreciate authors who can hide their agenda WITHIN the story without having their main character(s) railing out loud (unendingly) against the establishment. I found it fairly entertaining, and the ending took me a bit by surprise...but other than that it's Disch's self indulgent pose, through the main character Sacchetti, that may turn off the average reader. This really isn't even sci-fi...but who's keeping track? ;-)"
2,"Oh Boy, A Stinker For Sure","I really do hate writing bad reviews of Trek novels because I love Trek novels so much, but this has to be the worst novel based on Trek that I have ever read. Talk about forced reading, it was a complete struggle just to get through all that I did. Don't expect this to be an astounding story, it definitely isn't.Boring and uninspired, there are plenty of other Trek novels out there that are A Lot better"
1,Save your money.,"Don't be misled by the words ""Star Trek"" on the cover - other than being set in space, it has little to do with that universe. Your favorite characters meander in and out of the story uttering such absurd lines that you wonder if the author knows anything about ""The Next Generation"" or ""Star Trek"" generally. The story itself is clearly something that has been (badly) shoe-horned into ""Star Trek"" from some other genre. It could be an interesting premise of a story, but is just badly done. I would give this book zero stars if the option were available."
1,I want the last 4 hours of my life back!,"This book belongs in the children's' section - it reads like it was written for (and perhaps by) a 6th grader. It is clear that the author has no knowledge of the TNG characters beyond that of watching a few episodes. Their rich backgrounds and varied mannerisms in other books are reduced to caricatures of the characters - forget expansion of their stories, this is character contraction. This book started out bad, but just got worse. The destructive climax of the novel was resolved using a tired cliché, and the resolution evoked a deus-ex-machina solution that felt as bad as a reset-button trick. Forget saving your money - save the hours of your life that you are contemplating wasting with this load of garbage."
3,Not THAT bad,"This book was a slight disappointment to me because, based on the title and the back-of-the-book synopsis I expected a far more philosophical view at the problem of the day. It turned out however to be quite clear as to what was going to happen as well as what needed to happen. There were no dire consequences to the success of the story. What I mean by this is I was expecting this book to be a ""if we don't find a solution there'll be HUGE trouble, if we find a solution there'll still be some trouble."" There was also a part near the end where they went trough the holosuite history of a planet that I think lasted entirely too long. I still gave this 3 stars however, because once I was over the fact that it wasn't a philosophical story, I was able to enjoy it for what it was."
5,stunning--full of color--real philosophy and poetry,"this is what star trek is really all about: serious issues discussed with meaningful, rich characterization. of course fans of somtow's work already know that he's a stunning writer who just won the world fantasy award. it's amazing to see these talents brought into the star trek novel-writing universe where even when the concepts are great the writing is sometimes shallow. people expecting the same old thing won't find it here. this is right up there with the old james blish star trek books"
1,Highly Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. The whole thing just seemed ""off"", the characters, the narration. It's almost as if the author has no real understanding of Star Trek. This reads more like a standard SF fantasy rather than a ST story. The narration has this epic quality that seems way over the top, it's as if he's talking about a Norse adventure story. I find myself skimming the end because the plot is just so boring. There's no action, just some history that doesn't really make much sense."
2,Not very good.,"This book has a very weak plot, for all that a synopsis of it sounds promising enough. The idea (sister planets engaged in a millennia-old interstellar war, headed towards mutual destruction) isn't very original, the handling of it is pretty shallow and silly, the characterizations are rather two-dimensional and cardboard, the dialogue is bland and stilted, and the ending is contrived. Other than that, it was great!Sadly, even with all of that, it's far from the WORST Star Trek novel I've ever read, which is why I rounded my 1.5 rating up to two, but seriously, unless you REALLY need a Star Trek fix and there just isn't anything else handy, I wouldn't bother with it."
2,Slightly better than bare hands.,"Works only slightly better than bare hands. Purchased these for my mom who liked the rubber opener that I have. I thought this one was more attractive, but in this case looks were deceiving. The two I received are white (not clear as I assumed from picture) very thin and flimsy and have a horrible chemical odor. I'm not happy with them, but they are so cheap that it is not worth the shipping cost to return. I will donate and hope someone out there is happy with them. Trying the Fox Run brand next as they look thicker and more like the opener that I already have, which works great! I should have known better as the Norpro brand stainless cookie sheet I bought was of poor quality as well."
3,Floppy jar opener,Didn't grip well on regular jars but was great for small lids. I also use it to open finger nail polish bottles.
4,Mary Magdalene,While not an exhaustive study it is nonetheless entertaining and a good look at the often misrepresented saint. She was an apostle (one sent to tell the good news) and no where in scripture is she the prostitute the Catholic Church has made her out to be.
3,"ok,",but disappointed it how much information from the scroll was left out. The interpretation could also be improved upon. .
4,Same as Fox in Socks,"We are big Doctor Seuss fans and are attempting to get the entire collection for our daughter. Like the book, just too similar to Fox in Socks. Nothing but tongue twisters and no real story.Great to have if your trying to collect all Dr Seuss books. If completing the collection is not important to you, I would only chose this if you don't already have Fox in Socks"
5,Fond memories,"I just ordered this book for a 3 year old's birthday. Not as popular as Fox in Socks, but every bit as fun and twisty. At one point, I had the book completely memorized and some of the little ditties became household standard jokes (""Is this fresh fish from Finney's diner?"" ""Of course! There's none fresher or finer!"") One time, my high-strung son was throwing a tantrum outside a restaurant and I started softly saying some of the tongue twisters in the book and he chilled right out.Another book I fully recommend if you enjoy reading to your kids."
5,Favorite Book of my Children,"I'm a Grandma now, and this was one of my children's favorite books for me to read. I love Dr. Suess books because I like to read them dramatically to my kids, and now my grandkids. This is a real fun one to do that with, being full of tongue twisters and randomness."
4,oh say can you say is a very good book,its a rhymeing book good for all ages and fun to read. It will leave you with a smile on your face wondering how he did it again. Dr. Seuss is a great author and shows you why once again in this book....
5,A real guide to the actual Internet,"For those who want to discover the actual Internetin its diferent dimensions. Esay to read, hard to beat.A very usefull and complete guide to the Net comprehension.Just a must !"
5,By Way of The Heart,Dr. Au is my professor and I had first hand experience in being lectured on the book by the man himself. He is truly and amazing writer and a man in touch with his spirituality. He is book and his class had allowed me expore my faith and overall develop a spiritual relationship with God that is right for me. I recomend this book for anyone who is in need of guidance or who admires a well expressed book from a knowledgable man.
2,Hilarious!,"I love to read these out loud and using my pretentious beatnik voice. I had myself and my wife in stitches reading ""The Quarrel."" Groovy, man! How anyone could keep a straight face while writing this stuff I don't know. It's the next best thing to REAL poetry!"
3,Aerosoles Women's Coy Wonder,I like the looks of these shoes and they are comfortable. My problem is that I can't keep my heel from coming out. I think a smaller size would have been too tight in the toe area.
2,Ouch!,"Very cute shoes, but the leather is very hard and gave me terrible blisters. These are not as soft and comfortable as other pairs of Aerosoles I've worn. Wearing socks and padding has helped some, but these shoes are still uncomfortable. Great price though."
1,Do not waste your money!,"Although the orchestra in this recording does sound quite good, Thea King sounds far below the professional level of many other recordings of this piece. Her sound and articulation are both dreadful. Some clarinet teachers have actually been known to give this recording to students as a way of showing them how NOT to play the clarinet!! Put very simply, THIS IS NOT PRETTY CLARINET PLAYING, IT IS VERY UGLY.Sabine Meyer, Harold Wright, and Robert Marcellus have all made wonderful recordings of this piece. If you are looking for a quaility recording, with a high level of artistry, those recordings are a great bet. Also, Sabine Meyer plays the concerto on basset clarinet as well if that is something that your are specifically looking for."
5,Stunningly beautiful polyphony,"This disc is a collection of beautiful polyphonic songs from the late 15th century. The pieces by Morton and Binchois are particularly fascinating. These performances by the Gothic Voices are excellent, as always, and the recording is first rate. This is my favorite Gothic Voices recording."
5,Excellent,This product was nicely packaged and was practically brand new. This book is wonderful and the condition that it was in was excellent! The shipping was very quick also.
3,referr backward and forward,"I found this text book to have great examples. However, explanations were confusing from chapter to chapter.Also, there were continuing references to tables, examples etc. that were either in the previous section/chapter or the next page/section/chapter. This is very distractive when one is trying to understand a concept."
4,I teach out of this book.,"As the title says, I teach statistics using this text and I was surprised to see one very negative review of it. I did not choose the book (my graduate department did) but it is much more ""user-friendly"" than most, especially for the student who is new to statistics. It does not try to impress with arcane formulas and does not try to cover every data analysis contingency (e.g., situations you will run across once or twice in your career). It comes with tons of problems and answers and solutions for each. I'm glad that we made the switch."
4,Good book to use to learn Stats,This book got me to understand many statistics in life. Has several formulas to find things that would matter. Awesome. I would recommend this to teachers who plan on using books for stats.
5,OMG love stats!!!,Just bought it cuz I need it...no complaints...product was as expected and the package arrived on time. (maybe even early)
2,Should be KSA for limited Government Jobs,"This book has too few job examples and many of the jobs it does offer KSAs for are related. If I could, I wouldn't have spent the money or the 5 months it took to get it. Out of hundreds if not thousands of fed. jobs, this book manages to cover KSAs for whopping 42 of them. If you are in any science field other than medical, don't bother with this book."
2,not all KSA,Unfortunately it had nothing of value in this book for me it didn't touch on a single KSA I need help with.
2,Basic Information,"This book mostly contains examples of KSAs for intro level jobs. It doesn't have any examples for professional counselors, social workers, or other mental health providers. I purchased the book for the one example for ""guidance counselor"" which turned out to be for a bachelor level position and not a professional level counselor (master degree). There are very few KSAs at or above 11. Save your money and review the free examples online at one of the federal job sites."
2,Bike Mounting for GPS,"It is not streong enough, I have purchuased two, for me and for a friend and both are brouken after short time."
1,Garmin GPS 60CS Handlebar Mount,I have purchased 5 of these items and they break after 5-6 months of street riding. I'm glad I had the fore thought of using the GPS strap to secure the unit to my handlebar or the GPS would have bounced on the concrete street. I really enjoy the GPS unit and the handlebar mount is a great idea --- I only wish it would not break for no reason!
5,Had My Doubts ...,"... but after several thousand miles and almost as many pot-holes my 60csx is still firmly attached to the handlebars of my Harley. I've been tying the wrist strap to the mirror ""just in case"" but it's been over the worst terrain Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota have to offer without ever popping loose."
4,Rugged just like the car mount.,This is rugged just like the car mount. I have yet to use it though. I plan to put it on my snowmobile this winter and use the bread crumb feature on rides.
3,Ok product,"Nice original Garmin product. The rubber spacers that came with the unit are useless, the 2mm is too thin and the 5mm is too thick, leaving me with a unit that will not stay in place on my ATV. Once I improvise, I fear that my results in the field will be the same as already reported... needing extra reinforcememt to keep it in place."
4,GPS navigation for my bike has arrived.,Looking forward to warm weather so I can get out and have GPS tracking and navigation on my bike for the first time.
3,Useful if not as secure as I'd like,"I've owned a Garmin GPS 60 CSx for something like 5 years. It's a decent, not perfect, handheld GPS device. I purchased one of these to mount on my road bicycle to map and track my rides about 3 years ago. It worked well, but the clip in attachment mode never overwhelmed me for feeling secure. It has popped the unit out several times in fact, but fortunately the unit came out unscathed each episode. As I predicted, the snap in tab that secures the device to the mount one day snapped off. This is a replacement and anticipate another 2-3 years useful life before history will repeat. I continue to worry the unit will pop out and tumble down the road, but I have not found a reasonable substitute for this holder for my particular GPS and its use on bike handlebars. It functions, but I know it will fail. In the mean time happy riding....."
3,Works well - if it fits your bike,The unit held a GPS60CSx securely in place on a straight bar hybrid bike. I could not transfer it to my road bike though as the bracket does not fit around Bontrager drop handlebars (they are too thick).
1,Awful Mount,"I have ridden with this for about 4 months and today it broke completely. About a month ago, the top circle broke and the GPS came flying off the bike a couple of times. After that I strapped it down with elastics, which worked well enough. Today the entire top piece came off and it is now unusable. If you ride on any roads with potholes (almost every road here in Eastern Mass) then I would recommend finding a different mount. If you do buy this mount, make sure to secure the GPS to it with elastics or something similar."
5,Rock Solid!,"Very nice, high quality mount.The mount holds your gps with an iron grip on the roughest terrain.The plastic is tough and can take a little abuse.Super easy to install.U can't ask for more."
4,Garmin GPS 60 Bike Mount,"So far I have been pleasently surprised with this mount. It installs easily, but the first impression is that it is very flimsy compared to the Magellan mounts I was familar with. I gave it a torture test on some rough terrain and the 60CSx stayed firmly attached. I also give it good marks for design since it uses the belt mount hook. (included)"
4,Holds great,"Bought this mount to use on my polaris 4-wheeler, It holds and works great.Wish it had more movement."
3,Handlebar Mount - For bicycle only,"This was not the product I was expecting. I was planning to use it on my motorcycle, but the mounting clamp was much too small. Make work very well for a bicycle."
5,Tough and Simple,"The Garmin universal mount for the GPS Map 60 CS series is great - take it from the car to the bicycle, to the motorcycle in a jiffy. Or get two and just move the GPS.The little mount looks delicate, but don't let that deceive you. I took a spill on my trekking bike last winter, with the mount on the handlebars. The GPS wasn't in it, but the bracket (the thing with the loop at the top and the curved bottom, which actually holds the GPS) took a big wallop, which cracked the loop right at the top. I thought it was ruined. I glued it, which didn't hold, but it didn't need to. The GPS still sits tight and firm. I now use it for the car, and have an intact one on my bicycle - I'm a little risk-averse here...And for the price - can't be beat."
3,Fine . . kinda,"This bracket from Garmin is fine, but does not fill me with confidence, looks like the gps may pop out of it upon hitting a large bump. I use a cable-tie to secure it to my handlebar just in case."
5,Perfect for my bike,I have mounts for my kayaks and bike now. It's a great training aid to allow my GPSMAP 60 to track my speed and distance. The mounts work perfectly.
1,unuseable,my Garmin CS60 WILL NOT stay attached without rubberbands. To add insult to injury the service people at Garmin have not responded to two e-mails. Do NOT buy this produce untill Garmin actually tests it in the field and comes up with a better system.........FYI I LOVE my Garmin CS60. Just not for bike use.
1,Why is this so cheap?,"I agree, this is a flimsy piece of plastic that will not hold the GPS unit over a few little bumps. I expected more from Garmin. Consider this: Touratech Mount for Garmin 60C series. Its a solid unit. It costs a little more but you won't be replacing your GPS unit due to it falling to the ground."
2,Possible Amazon Error,"I bought this CD for one particular song which was listed on the review, and it was not on the CD. Since I bought this CD several years ago, I thought maybe it was revised and the additional song ""I love how you love me"" was added. It was not. Anthology is a great (album) CD, but Amazon could be at fault for this error."
1,"hey, wait a minute!","ok--at first, i said ""YES!""--they listed the tunes...but then i compared the two anthologies, and quickly realized that you HAVEN'T LISTED THE EXTRA TRACKS! it's the EXTRA TRACKS that i'm interested in--if they are what i hope, then i would order it...u know?"
2,Middle of the Road,"While I don't mind several of The Baby's songs and respect the individual muscianship, I find the majority of their stuff to be over produced. It seems like they're trying to hard to make a hit instead of making good music."
5,Nicely Remastered Anthology from U.K.'s The Babys!,"I always liked this group from day one! John Waite has an excellent voice and it didin't surprise me that he was successful as a solo artist in the 80's. The Baby's put out excellent ballads such as ""Isn't It Time"" and ""Everytime I think of You"" (both big hits) as well as great rock n' roll. Songs such as ""Head First"", ""Love Don't Prove I'm Right"", and ""Back On My Feet Again"" (to mention a few) are extremely catchy and very radio friendly. The Baby's (in my opinion) never really made it as big as they should have, but atleast they left us with some great songs and a nice collection of l.p.'s as well. Highly Recommended!"
3,I'm pleasantly surprised,"Psst, I got to tell you something. When this stuff first came out, this did nothing for me, NOTHING. I thought it was syrupy and weak.However, a second listen, decades later, reveals something different. This is richly melodic, excuisitely crafted, power pop. This is pretty good stuff. And you know what? It holds up pretty well and sounds contemporary. I dig it!Some highlights are;""Isn't it time"" is a beautiful song with a gorgeous piano interlude and a powerful, horn-charged chorus. What a great song!""Back on my feet again"" is rather 80's sounding but, nonetheless, has an effective, anthemic chorus.""Head First"" is a fast-paced rocker that discusses chasing/stalking a beautiful girl. It's a legitimate rocker.The rest of the songs are well written and have depth.This was a talented band that put out quality pop songs."
4,"No reason to cry, Babys","Emerging as a pretty faced bubble-pop band in the 70's, The Babys quickly evolved into a first rate power-pop outfit and scored several top-40 hits. Eventual solo star andBad EnglishmemberJohnathan Waitewas the focal point, with his clean and soulful vocals. Keyboardist Jonathan Caine, while not an original member, found later success as a member ofJourney.The band excelled at pop-rock, like ""Midnight Rendezvous"" and ""Back On My Feet Again."" While no-one would ever classify them as heavy, a song like ""Head First"" had echoes of""Hot Blooded"", or maybe Rick Springfield frontingCheap Trick. The ballads pretty much are what you'd expect if you followed Waite's solo career. Much better than average, and good for 70's nostalgia, The Babys called it quits in 1981."
1,very fine After Armageddon,"Fine and unconventional fantasy, clearly drawing at least partly on north american indianmyth. Can't be summarised; must be read. In this book, comradeship between men, betrayal.Very fine."
2,Consistent throughout,"On every track of this CD, Cristina demonstrates complete and precise chromatic control of every possible note throughout her range of almost a full octave. Likewise, the production, style, and presentation is consistent throughout this CD; listen to any track, and you've heard what the rest of the CD is like. I admit I was seduced by a PBS puff piece about fado, featuring Cristina Branco, and I bought the CD expecting much more variety within the fado style, and also a broader range of performance from Ms Branco. If you want one, I'll sell mine cheap."
3,DeLonghi toaster /broiler baker,"This large capacity toaster does not have an interior light and takes a longer than usual amount of time to toast. The good thing about it is it does not burn the toast when putting more bread in it for a second round of toasting.I have not used the broiler part of it, but it bakes very well,and does so rapidly. It's inexpensive and does the job!!"
2,DeLonghi EO1260 Stainless-Steel Toaster Oven with Broiler,"This is a great toaster oven. It makes perfect toast every time and is great for warming sweet rolls, small dishes, and many other items.However, it has a major flaw! I HAVE REPLACED THE TIMER SWITCH THREE TIMES! This flaw causes the bell to fail after a while and the timer continues past the stop position on into the ON POSITION. Therefore, if you take out your food and walk away...THIS IS A SERIOUS FIRE HAZARD!Good luck if you buy this product!I have just thrown it into the trash bin and will be buying a different brand to replace it!"
1,POS!,"Very, very bad. Can't toast at all. Flimsy controls. Very cheap feeling. Laughably expensive for what you get."
1,Delonghi does not stand behind their products,"We had a Black and Decker toaster oven which lasted us close to 20 years, then, after enduring a poor Cuisinart substitute, we settled on the Delonghi. For the one year or so that it worked, it was great. After it died, slightly more than a year after purchase, Delonghi refused either to replace or repair.With all due respect, a toaster oven ought to be able to last reliably beyond 1 year, regardless of what the formal guaranty is.I will not be purchasing another Delonghi product any time soon."
1,NOT SAFE!!! DO NOT BUY!! DEFECTIVE/DANGEROUS!!!,"Please, please, please don't buy this product! How it is still available is beyond me. Our oven (about a year old) got stuck in the ""on"" position during toasting this morning. We noticed this and so we unplugged it (the only way to turn it off at this point, very dangerous). A couple of minutes later, while unplugged, the glass on the front blew up and shattered all over my kitchen countertop and floor! Please Amazon, take it off your site, you're selling a defective, dangerous product! I'll post pictures if I can figure out how to."
1,"Not just cheap, dangerous.","Two of three of the knobs have broken on our De'Longhi Toaster oven within the year. The center control didn't work well before it's knob broke off.I called De'Longhi to get replacement knobs, and they claim to have ""no complaints"" about this toaster over. I will direct them to this review page. They have offered replacement knobs to me at my own expense because I failed to call them within the warrantee period, and that's fine because my aggravation with them is what led me to look up reviews of this product. I am going to send a link to this page to Crate and Barrel customer service as well, because I am shocked that they are willing to carry a product as poorly made as this one.Judging from other reviews, this item is worse than cheap, it is dangerous."
4,toaster oven,"I purchased several of these ovens for our breakroom at work. They work great, but are not exactly a commercial grade. I have searched but have not found a better oven for the price. Easy to clean and operate."
5,A loyal Delonghi shopper,"I have only purchased Delonghi toaster ovens my entire life, I have never needed another brand. I felt they were the kings of toaster ovens ... I replaced an older model not for any other reason than it was starting to look ""old"" in our modern kitchen. Very satisfied with it, highly recommend!"
1,Walk away,"This toaster oven looks beautiful on the counter. Just leave it there to enhance your kitchen but don't plug it in. The shabby knobs break the moment they are stressed at all, the toaster does not toast.... if you want toast for LUNCH, turn it on at BREAKFAST, mechanical timer sounds like the ""60 MINUTES"" stopwatch and is only a few minutes (for toast). No timer for oven. I am truly sad because it looked so good!"
4,Excellent oven,"This oven is very nice. This will bake as well as a large oven without burning edges. I used this for 5 months now several times per week with no trouble with the dials as others complained about.My only complaint is the labeling of the dials. I recently cleaned this unit with oven cleaner which turned this into a new unit again. The only problem was the dial lettering started to fade away. So be careful with cleaners. I should have taped over them for protection but live and learn.Anyway, I would have liked to see the lettering engraved instead of enamel paint.Still a fantastic oven and would purchase again if needed."
1,Door EXPLODED!!! Glass everywhere!,Delonghi has been the worst company to deal with. Not only did they sell me a hazardous appliance but they will not respond to phone calls or emails regarding warranty. The glass door on this oven exploded while I was cooking chicken nuggets. I only had the oven for 3 months when it exploded. I paid over $80 for it and will never buy another Delonghi product again. I'm just grateful my children were not infront of the oven when the glass exploded or there could have been serious injuries.
1,DeLonghi toaster oven EO2060,"This is the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased. The outside door heats up so much you must use an oven mitt to open it. The two broiler elements are so far apart that it's impossible to broil any piece of meat properly. The temperature on the dial bears absolutely no relationship to the temperature inside the oven. The inside temperature is so erratic I have to watch an oven thermometer constantly and readjust the dial in order to get anything inside to cook evenly. And my watchfulness often fails. I will never buy a DeLonghi product again. If you're considering buying this model, don't even think about about it."
1,Truly the Pits,"Last week I threw out my DeLonghi EO1260 and my new Cuisinart arrived yesterday.I had to replace the knobs on the DeLonghi twice ... the last time, the charge for 2 knobs and 2 springs (yes, separatecharges for each) was $30 including shipment to NYC. Go figure. Then with visitors here for Christmas one of thenew knobs came off again. Had to use priers to use the unit. Then, at least the visitors had left, the heating system went off and the DeLonghi went out!!All this not even to have mentioned how non sympathetic the customer service was...short of being rude. This has truly been a negative and expensive experience not to have ever had a satisfactory result."
1,Dangerous VERY Dangerous,"I've had my Delonghi Toaster Oven for about 3 1/2 years. In that 3 1/2 years, the knobs have broken off, the timer has stuck itself so that everything in the toaster oven burns. Most recently the timer would ding but instead of turning itself off, it would continue timing after the ding, turn itself off, and then time past the off position to where it turned itself to the on position. This happened in the middle of the night the other night and barring the fuse actually blowing could have burned down the house with me and my family in it!!! This item should be barred from being sold! I'll never do business with Delonghi again!"
2,Doesn't last!,"This was the 2nd DeLonghi toaster oven that I purchased. I didn't even have the product 6 months before it self-destructed. The on/off timer knob does not last on these units. The unit itself looks good and works well when it is working. However, It should last longer than 6 months. If you register the unit, DeLonghi still won't honor the warranty unless you have the original receipt. Then, at your expense, you have to package it and ship it off to some distant repair station, unless you live in one of those few cities that have one. I'm sure DeLonghi knows that most people would not be willing to go through the expense of having the unit boxed and shipped. My advice would be to find another brand of toaster oven and purchase that one instead."
1,just to add to the list of parts that fail on this thing...,"I received this as a wedding gift. Shortly after it was 1 year old, the glass door spontaneously shattered after I had just toasted some waffles. DO NOT BUY!"
2,De'shorti,"The reason for my title is for this product's very short life. I bought this product from a local Macy's and it stopped working after one year. It just wouldn't turn on. Of course I couldn't return it because it was past the one year warranty stage. For the price I paid for it, I would expect it to last a lot longer than it did. Before this product, I had a simple (and cheaper) Black & Decker toaster oven that lasted for over 4 years.Also while it did work, the door sometimes wouldn't open all the way, causing a few burns on my wrist and hand."
3,DeLonghi 1260,"I was searching for an attractive stainless steel countertop toaster oven, and I chose the DeLonghi over the Kitchen Aid and Cuisinart based on looks. The knobs on this toaster are really lousy. They are plastic and do not turn smoothly at all. The toaster occupies alot of counter space due to the semi-circular outcuopping at the rear to accomodate pizza. It is NOT a convection oven."
4,Delight With DeLonghi,An excellent toaster oven with great looks that match our stainless steel appliances. It functions very well. The knobs are not up to the same quality as the rest of the oven.
1,DeLonghi customer service is AWFUL!,I purchased this toaster oven because I loved its exterior design and thought it would look great in my kitchen. It did... until the middle knob came off after less than 6 months of use. I've been using a pair of pliers to turn it on for the last 5 months while I await my replacement part. I have followed-up on my request with DeLonghi customer service on a number of occassions and they offer no solution other than to continue to wait. I even left a message with a supervisor and received no response whatsoever. I vow to never buy a DeLonghi product again. Still waiting for that knob...
1,Already broken...,"I purchased this high-end toaster oven because I wanted /needed a proficient smaller oven for smaller baking needs. After 5 months of moderate usage, however, the middle knob has malfunctioned and it will no longer bake. Other than that I was satisfied with the product. I called their customer service and to get it repaired under warranty, will have to ship it at least 250 miles away, at my expense. What a hassle. I may just go buy a cheap toaster oven to replace it instead of spending the time and money on postage. Live and learn....just because a product costs more doesn't mean it's better."
2,"Nice Look, Not so Nice Features","1. Knobs fell off within a few weeks. Nice appearance but very cheaply made.2. Replacement knobs are on backorder for 4 weeks, apparently, it happens alot. I don't expect the new knobs to last very long either if it's the same design.3. The on/off switch is connected to the timer. When cooking is done, the timer should ""ding"". But when I switch it from on to off, it shouldn't ding also!4. The on/off light indicator is impossible to see unless you're in pitch darkness. Seems like a hazard to me.5. Other than that, it works..so far. It does have a nice Stainless Steel look however."
1,"Defective switch, poorly thought-out","Very happy with capacity, appearance, etc. Switch design makes this ""designed to be defective"" toaster ultimately dangerous to house and home. Our switch went after a year (past warrenty period) and the toaster cannot now be turned off except via the plug. We're sending it to the landfill (which is sickening) and buying a toaster oven from someone else. Sad."
3,this is NOT a convection toaster oven,I have no idea why this is called a Convection Toaster Oven. Convection cooking is not a feature on this model. The light indicator is almost impossible to see. The manual instructs you to turn the Toaster -Bake feature off every time you toast even though the bell rings indicating it is off; seems to be an unnecessary chore. The stainless steel exterior shows finger smudges and it is not easy to remove. It toasts well but seems to take a very long time when toasting more than 2 slices especially if you like more well done toast. In the future I will stay away from the higher end products and rely on the basic mid-priced toaster ovens.
1,Terrible Piece of Junk,"I bought this toaster oven because it seemed to be built well and had all the basic features I needed. Wrong! Within the first year, two of the three knobs on the front broke. They are made of a cheap plastic material. The knob to turn on the oven instead of the timer never worked correctly. I can't reach anyone at the company to help. They are useless and so is my $100 toaster over. Stay away from this POS."
1,All That Glitters......,"This is a nice-looking unit, but very cheaply made. DeLonghi products are no longer the sturdy, attractive appliances they once were. The three knobs are chrome-plated plastic and not metal. Also, there is no timer. I just gave away a GE toaster oven that was entirely made of metal, had a timer for frozen foods, felt far more substantial AND was 1/2 the price. We will see how long this tinny-feeling $100.00 toaster oven works......"
1,Good-looking but CRAP performance,"I have had and liked DeLonghi toaster ovens in the past and bought this one based on that performance history, plus it's good looks.This model however, takes A CENTURY to toast or broil anything. It has one heating element on the top and one on the bottom, but they more or less ring the outer area of the oven, so there is no coverage over the main center rack space.In short, this toaster oven is TERRIBLE! You can do much better.Unfortunately, I tossed the packaging or I would have returned it."
1,Read this before buying or plugging in!,"I received this item as a gift to match a DeLonghi toaster and electric kettle. I took it out of the box, read the owner's manual, plugged it in, cleaned the kitchen and went to bed. 2-3 hours later I smelled something burning this morning, so I walked downstairs- I found the oven smoking! It was not on or doing anything- it was just plugged in sitting there! I never even got to use it! Be careful!!"
2,broke quickly,"After a few month of usage 2 knobs broke, so I bought new knobs. Then a few days ago the middle knob which controls the temperature stopped turning the toaster off, I have to unplug the toaster now. It seems like a common issue with this toaster so I am very surprised the company and Amazon are still selling it."
1,Brittle tips.,"These were a huge disappointment. The tips, both slotted and Philips have broken under modest torque. Cheaply made. I love the length but the quality is bad"
2,CHEAP,"STEEL IS NOT MADE OF GOOD QUALITY. WILL REACH HARD TO REACH SPACES, BUT THE DRIVE WILL WEAR OUT ON THIGHT SCREWS."
2,Way too big for a mouse cable!,"This thing may be handy for large cables like power cables to your PC, but it certainly isn't intended for something like a mouse cable. The thing is larger than most mice. Use this if you need to wind up something like a power cable, but find something else to manage your mouse or telephone cable."
1,"Garbage, misleading size reference","Purchased what I was told were 10-15 over the calf socks. What I received TWICE after a reorder were socks that were in a package marked size 6-12. TWICE! Don't call them what they arent Hanes. Had to pay portion of shipping out of pocket last time, might as well keep these and find some kid with little feet to give these to. I wear a size 13 shoe and no way are these over the calf as advertised."
2,"Too short to be called ""over the calf""","I was hopeful buying these, but those hopes died a quick death when I tried the first one on. The foot portion is great, but they are a tall ""crew sock"" height at best. Came to mid point on my calf muscle, and were so tight at the ribbed top they were painful. I would not try these if your calf runs higher than maybe 11 inches above the ankle. Shame on you, Hanes."
2,"Incomplete, and Biased Besides","This book gives short shrift to anything vampire-related that doesn't interest the author personally. It also, as a previous reviewer noted, paints vampire afficianadoes as sexual deviants and credits too much to the Freudian idea that all forms of personal expression are rooted in sexual misgivings. Not of the slightest interest to anyone who REALLY wants to know what vampires are all about."
2,Not David's Best.,"David Skal is one of the better writers on Horror Literature and Media.However,in this particular book, he spends too much time analysing our love of vampires and the like,as an indication that we are sexually disturbed or have a streak of facism in our character.Sorry David, but some of us just liked to be spooked!"
3,7th heaven,"MARY is a strong , smart, teen who plays basketball and loves sports. In this book Mary sneaks out of the house to see her old boyfriend. Mary did not want her parents to find out because she was supposed to be babysitting her twin brothers. This is an ok book but I liked the other ones better ."
3,All The Fat None of the calories,The Ghost In The Shell: Individual Eleven Movie is Basically Second Gis without the B-Stories or original VA's. While the overall plot and story is good the B-Stories sometimes Gave you Background info not found in the A-story. Why characters disappear and appear with no explanation. if it's still on sale this a worthy purchase but if you liked second Gig You are better off getting the complete season set. the VA's did an OK Job Emulating the voices but you'll notice and miss the Original's.
5,"A lively celebration of Irish life, history and people.","Nathaniel Harris' Heritage Of Ireland celebrates Irish life and history, providing a lively review of the peoples and geography which have formed the Irish peoples. Vintage illustrations and modern photos accompany a fine colorful review."
5,I love it,"this is a fast paced never boring workout.I am a big firm fan and for the other firm fans ,you will not be disappointed. I would buy from this seller again.I recieved my dvd even before it was expected to arrive and it was exactly as described"
4,IT'S ALRIGHT,"I just did this for the first time last night and though it did get my heart rate up, I felt that the cardio section was too short. A lot of reviewers are calling this a tough workout but I didn't think it was that hard at all. I am an advanced exerciser, but I'm still 170 lbs, so I'm not just saying that because I'm in amazing physical shape. I think super cardio, calorie killer 2 (power cardio), and fat blaster were all harder than this one. She does lift the weights a bit too fast but if you use this as more of a pure cardio routine instead of a strength routine and keep the weights light (3lbs) you should be ok. It was fun though, and the hour just seemed to fly by. The instructor is pretty and very pleasant to listen to. I will be adding it to my rotation for lighter days."
5,Better than Insanity,I started using this video VHS back in 1990. I pulled it out of storage Last December 2011. I lost 15 pounds and got toned in a couple of months. I thought I would try something new this spring. Everyone was raving about insanity. I hated it and it was making me bulky. I'm going back to the firm. I am replacing all my VHS with DVD's.
4,quick results!!,"This workout has got to be one of the best I've done. It wonderfully incorporates cardio with weights. No need to worry, ladies, you won't bulk up and look like a man, unless of course you're taking steroids! The instructor doesn't look too masculine and neither will you. I do this tape twice a week and it is still challenging. Once a week I'll workout to a kickboxing tape (Aaron Lankford) to keep myself from getting bored. As you get better at one set of weights, simply use a heavier weight to stay challenged and keep yourself from reaching a ""plateau."" I don't have to worry about any body part being neglected. Now that I'm in my 30s (31), I find that weightlifting is an essential part of working out. The music is kind of cheesy and at times you'll want to cuss the instructor out for making some of the moves seem easy, but still I highly recommend this tape!!!"
4,Good Muscle Shaper and Fat Burner!,"I am starting to excercise after having a baby, this was a good video to build muscle and endurance with weights. You can choose your weight level, which makes you muscles develop slowly and more effectively. The leg excercises are done with weights on the ankles, I recommend placing them above the knee. This video will make you sweat!"
