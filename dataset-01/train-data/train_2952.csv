5,Simply the best,"I would say that my beard is thicker than the average fellow. And I have used MANY razors over the years, including a few electric shavers. These razors are, hands down, the best I have used. A high price, yes, but they work, and they work very well.Note: This is the second time I bought these online. The first time I felt like maybe the cartridges were not quite as sharp as usual. Perhaps my imagination, or perhaps some ""seconds"".Highly recommended."
4,Standard 3 blade razor,"These blades last me a long time. I buy one of these packs every year and a half or so. I shave everyday, except for maybe a month and half a year where I grow my beard for a little bit.I like the 3 blade razor, and see no reason to buy a new handle and different blades. I use a brush and soap in a bowl, but these also worked well with gel when I used to use that."
5,"3, 4, or 5 blades","Isn't it crazy how we've come to a point in time where the best these guys can do in razor technology is to add another blade every two to three years. Well I've used the three, four, and five blade versions and to be honest the difference is very minoot. I do however notice some difference in going from a two bladed razor to one of the three, four, or fives. So I say skip the two bladers all together and stick with the three blades as long as these guys keep making them."
5,"Gillette, the best...","I tried some other blades because I thought the price Gillette charges for their blades was just unreasonable. To conclude, nothing out there is better than Gillette, so I guess they can justify the high price."
3,Decent blades and decent price,"I have owned Mach3 razor for over 3 years now. The razor is good, but hard to differentiate its performance from Sense Excel ( I have owned that one before). Only reason I switched to Mach3 was honestly, I got bored using the same razor. The blades give normal performance, nothing out of the blue like they show on tv. It doesn't causes itching, so that the good part about the blades. However, after a month of use, for a good shave you will need multiple strokes on the same spot. Overall, decent purchase, nothing extraordinary."
3,blade extenders,"Please note that there are blade savers you can buy that can extend the life of razor blades considerably.The one I use is Razorpit. There is also one called Everblade that supposedly also works.After spending something like $45 on Mach 3 blades at the department store some weeks back, in order to have a few months supply, I decided to try one of these blade extenders that supposedly allows you to get a whole lot more shaves out of razor blades.With the Razorpit, I am at least getting about 3 times as many shaves per blade. Some people have said they get like 100-200 shaves per blade. I guess the key is that these blades don't lose their efficacy after a few shaves because they go dull, but because they accumulate gunk. The blade saver products allow you to remove the gunk.I'm sure Gillette and the other blade makers are hoping the whole world doesn't catch onto this."
3,Great...for a short time.,"I bought these for a great price compared to Wal-Mart and drugstore.com but my concern is with the razor itself. They work excellent but only for a few uses. They dull very quickly. They shouldn't for the price. The Fusion is much, much longer lasting."
1,NOT the same as store bought Mach3s,I thought I found a good deal on these blades but they were NOT like the smoooth Mach3 blades I buy at the store. These blades said Mach3 but were very rough on the face and not smooth at all... all the blades were that way..Pointless spending even a dollar per blade for this quality. MAch3s are great blades though the ones you get online from here are either fake or just bad.
1,Not sharp - not at all the Mach3's I'm used to,"These blades are not sharp and shaving is just painful.I should have paid more attention to what the other reviewers were saying... I've been using Mach3 cartridges for many years and I strongly believe these are, indeed, NOT the real deal. Extremely disappointing, considering they're sold directly by Amazon.Buy at your own risk; mines are going straight to the garbage bin."
2,Why do they get dull so fast?,"When I bought my first Mach 3, it worked great, and the initial blade lasted for about three weeks. The refills that came with it lasted similarly long.Then I bought refills, and each blade was dull within a week and a half.About two years ago, I found a place on the Web that sold cryonically-treated razor cartridges (you can Google for ""cryogenically tempered Mach 3 razor""). They were slightly more expensive than most Web retailers, but they last at least three times as long... I'm just now running out of them (I think I bought 32, and gave eight to my dad).Anyway, I only posted this because these cartridges popped up as the top recommendation on my home page. Weird."
1,"Dull, don't swivel","I'm not sure about the other reviewers who say they are fake... the packaging sure looks real, but the blades are definitely not right. First, they are not sharp at all. Second, there's is something about the backside of the blades that causes the swivel mechanism on the razor to jam. The blade ends up stuck perpendicular to the razor handle and basically doesn't shave. I've tried the same blade on two different razor handles: it's definitely the blade, not the handle."
5,No Nicks or Cuts,"Mach3 has been my favorite ever since they first come around, as it was the only razor to never cut or nick my face... I love them, but the blades dull so quickly and are only good for a few shaves before having to replace the cartridge."
5,Very sharp blades,I've been using the disposable blades for a long time and decided to give a try to Mach 3 and I'm totally impresses with the sharpness of blades. I also feel my skin smooth and soft after shaving and I don't even feel need to repeat the shaving on any area as I used to do with disposable ones. These are good quality and highly recommended.
1,"Not the same, perhaps counterfeit or reject blades","I have used the standard Mach 3 blades since they came out (several years), and tried to save money by purchasing these. Bad choice: As with others, the packaging was faded, and although the blades look the same, they are NOT. A normal new blade would glide over my face, easily removing any facial hair. These blades purchased from Amazon are worse than a 2 month old used blade; right out of the package they scrape across my skin and pull the facial hair. I suggest avoiding these at all cost!"
1,Terrible razors,"The razors I bought here are NOT the actual Gilette Mach3 razors that you buy in the store. The razors purchased here are not durable, they are very brittle and they only have a useful life of about 2 shaves per blade. The actual Gilette Mach3 blades are good for nearly a full week of shaving. These razors are causing me to nick myself every other day.Garbage blades. Don't buy em."
5,Three blades is the charm,"I've used single blade, double blade and four-blade razors, and I've even tried the headblade, but nothing i've used before shaves without clogging and lasts nearly as long as the Gillette Mach 3. I've been using them for years, on both my face and my head. It shaves close as you like, and can handle the rough stuff with ease(I usually only shave once a week). Also I've never experienced skin irritation like I have with some of the other blades. The only negative I could mention is they are more expensive than I would like for something that just removes facial and head hair, but isn't everything nowadays. You get what you pay for, and these work well."
2,not good for a close shave,I prefer my older Sensor Excel to the Mach3 when I want a close shave. I still have stubble on the chin and jaw line when I finish shaving with the Mach3. It also does not shave well on the neck area. Thumbs down for this product.
5,great blades,"I have no problem with them. Have been using these blades for about 5 years, purchases at sam's and the px. The blades from amazon give a good shave, there's no difference except for a much lower price."
2,Impersonator?,"Is it possible that these razors are imitation knock offs? they seem quite dull and don't last. I only shave twice a week, and these razors didn't last very long at all."
4,package ok and razors seem fine,"IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONI fell in love with Mach3 razors years and switched over from a single-blade (not straight-edge) razor. I just wish the price was cheaper! I saved a few bucks and time by ordering these Mach3 razors directly through Amazon. Everything went fine with the order. The package arrived quickly and the product was not opened. The razors appear to be in their original packaging (plastic is not cut and it is the Gillete stuff).THE CATCHI thought I had gotten past all the online negative reviews of counterfeits. Nonetheless, I found it quite odd that the plastic cases (holding 4 razors each) were scrapped and had smudges on them once I cut open the plastic packaging. Those oddities seem to suggest the product is not brand new.CONCLUSIONAll seems fine so far. We'll see..."
1,Counterfeits! What a rip off!,These blades are dull after the first swipe over your face. The real Gillette blades last well over a week.Definitely fake! Definitely counterfeits.Don't waste your money.
5,"Great deal, great blades",These blades are the real deal. Much cheaper than you'd buy at a retail store (which are outrageously expensive). No issues with the quality as posted in other reviews. These are not knockoffs. Happy shavin! Buy these.
2,Gillette Mach3 Cartridge 12-Count,It was average. The lubricating strip was dried out. It must be an old item.
1,I ignored other reviews and regretting now,Cartridge blades lost sharpens after just three shaves and now its like shaving using stone I am returning the order.
2,Knock offs?,"You must be kidding!These razor blades couldn't hold an edge for more than four shaves. Are they ""knock-offs"" from China?'Too bad for me, the alternatives are not great..........RN"
4,Like it,Its the only blades I've tried that don't make me itch after I shave but I wsh they were less expensive
5,No Surprises Here,"These razors work just like you'd expect. They're new, arrived quickly, and saved some money. All in all a good buy."
2,These are not Gillette product,"They work ok but are not a genuine Gillette razor. Clearly counterfeit. The moisture strip dissolves in one shave and the ""stainless steel"" will show rust if left in the shower."
2,"Are these real, fake or just old?","I bough these three weeks ago, and to be honest, either these are fake or they must be really old, because they can't match new Mach3's that you buy in the local store. It's like shaving with the cheapest set of razors that you'd buy at 99 cent store.. Stay away from these.."
1,Definitely FAKE!!,"I read a few other reviews about these blades being fake and didn't believe it since i've never had such an experience ever. The blades looked fine but within 3-4 days of opening them, the blades started rusting. Stainless Steel blades cannot rust. The lubricating strip dissolves in no time, the blades get clogged. I have used Mach 3 blades for over 8 years and can clearly tell that these are not original blades.STAY AWAY FROM THESE. Pay the extra dollar and buy them from a reputed store."
1,"These are Fake, do not buy","I have only purchased the Gillette Mach 3 since 2000. I never minded the high in store price point because of how sharp the blades are and how long they last. A month or so ago I decided why not buy these through a reputable site like amazon to save some money? I bought a package of 15 and I can't say how dissapointed I am.First and foremost are not real. The blade is comparable to a high end disposable blade and does not cut at about 10% the effectiveness of the in store Mach 3 blades. I have not had one good shave since buying these. Originally I thought my first blade was simply just defective, but that is the case for all the blades in the package as I have tried 7 of them and they are only good for one below average shave.Never again will I buy these from Amazon. I will explore return options, but I wanted to ensure the rest of the general public does not waste their money or fall for this scam. My advice is spend the extra money in store."
1,Mach 3 Gillette,The merchandise arrived promptly after order. I never thought I say this but The razorz that were purchased were of substandard quality and I will never purchase from the vendor again. I threw away all razors after a few trials.
1,BE CAREFUL! They aren't all the real thing.,I bought these for my husband and thought I was saving a lot of money only to find out that the first pack was fine and the rest were bad blades. He says they do not shave well and have a glue substance on them. We just bought a pack from Target and what a difference! this is the last time I buy something like this on the internet.
1,did not fit fusion razor,not what i thought i was buying. I have no use for them until i buy the mach three razor
3,$$$????,"My husband LOVES these blades. Uses it for both his face and head. Gets alot of shaves out of one blade! AS for the price, I have bought them for years so I knew they were pricey; however, I could have done better for the even the 15 count at local Walmart!"
4,great price! better than WalMart & Target!,my husband & I use this razor!. works great! love the price here versus even WalMart & Target. can't beat this deal.
3,Cheaper than costco!,I order razors heads from amazon.com because it's so mcuh cheaper than buying in stores even with a manufacture coupon
5,great product,"Excellent product, good service from vendor as well as priced right. I certainly would reorder without hesitation. Delivered in a very timely manner."
5,movie,"Received the movie in very good condition, but it won't play on my DVD.I can play it on my laptop, but not on the desk top computer! Please help me out"
1,Fire hazard,"WARNINGWe have owned our Cuisinart DCC-1100 for approx 1&1/2 years. This morning I smelled burning electrical wiring and found the coffee maker smoking! If I hadnt been home to unplug it, I am sure there would have been a fire. It appears that the thermostat for the warming plate failed. Products made in China may not be of the quality we expect......I read about other people experiencing the same thing with this model on another web site. cuisinartsucks.com/"
1,Poor Cooffee Maker,Bought this coffee maker in feb 2009. Took 20 min to brew 12 cupsWe always use filtered water.Brew Time as of Nov is 30 min for 12 cups. Cuisinart never answered my email when I inquired about returning it.It's supposed to have a 2 year warranty! Will never buy a cuisinart product again. Bought a $20 Hamilton Beach to replace it! Great coffee in 9 minutes!!
5,Very pleased,So far I am very happy with this coffee maker. The pink is not too bright & it makes nice hot coffee. The carafe seems pretty sturdy too. I had a pink cooks brand coffeepot that was so bad I threw it out. I read all the reviews on this model in all colors & almost everyone Likes this model. I am hoping it will last for a long time as it looks great in my kitchen. The 3 year warranty is nice too.
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"I recently purchased this item from my local Lowe's store. (it is just over the 30 day limit to return an item) It has produced about 4 pots of coffee before it died. When calling Cuisinart for help, I was given a big run around by a women who named herself Kimberly. Even after I explained that the unit was dead, she was trying to explain to me that I would need to decalcify the coffee maker. I couldn't get thru to her that the coffee maker was dead. I got nowhere with her or with Cuisinart. I now own a $70 paper weight and will NEVER buy another Cuisinart product again!"
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I wouldn't buy this coffeemaker again because the on/off button doesn't work very well. Even brand new, we have to hit the button several times, or push on it in a certain manner to get it to turn on. I suspect its a design flaw, but perhaps its just our particular one. I wouldn't risk buying this one again. Also, it has an annoying chime that threatens to wake up the infant when the coffee is done...maybe that can be silenced, but who wants to spend the effort"
3,"Not a review, but a question.","How long does it take to brew a 12 cup pot of coffee with this Cuisinart? I have a 4 year old Kitchen Aid and even after it's been cleaned, it takes about 1/2 hour to brew a 10 cup pot. Thinking this is too long, I'm possibly in the market for a new coffee maker.Thanks for info.Cathy"
1,audible tone,"I just received the Cuisinart coffee maker today and operated it for the first time, only to discover that the machine beeps five times in a very high pitched tone after the brewing cycle is finished. So for any of you with tinnitus, this is a painful sound.The coffee maker might be the greatest ever, however, I am thinking about sending it back and finding another brand. There was no indication in the Amazon descriptions regarding the tone, and I called Cuisinart only to find out that all their coffee makers have this feature and that there is no way to disengage it.Too bad, because it looks great, operates easily and no doubt makes good coffee!"
1,Unit LEAKS!!!! But It Looks Nice.,"Have had this unit for three days now, has been working okay up to this morning. When we went to the kitchen for our coffee that had been programmed the night before to be ready when we awoke....surprise....WATER all over...counter...down to our wood floors!!!We had no complaints for the previous three mornings, but this morning was quite different. I had filled the reservoir to the 9 cup mark, so it wasn't overfilled....the unit had not been dropped, etc. Anyway, the water tank leaks somewhere....and besides the unit won't turn on at all....just beeps on and off, senses something is wrong? I'll agree, now I'm back to trying to find a coffee maker that works. Had spent so many hours here online trying to make that ""right"" decision. Other than leaking, this units heats well and seemed to work okay...but just won't hold water!!"
2,Auto-brew timer went kaput after 3 years,"I bought this in Nov. of 2009. In Oct, 2012, the timer function stopped working. It still lets me brew coffee manually (and does a good job of it). But, I can no longer wake up to a nice, freshly brewed pot waiting for me. I have to drag myself out of bed, punch the start button, and crawl back in bed to wait. A much less existentially appealing experience!"
3,Thought I Liked It,Everything seemed fine. Made exactly 2 pots of coffee with it and now the lid will not snap back on. I discovered this while pouring a cup of coffee.....all over the counter fortunately.
4,Some Reviewers Don't Understand Product,"This is a decent coffee maker. Decent, not fabulous. But not too expensive either. Coffee is plenty hot enough for me, especially if I follow the manufacturer's recommendation to rinse the carafe with hot water first. The five short beeps when the coffee is done are not nerve-jangling as some wrote. It's a very minimal notification alert sound. Most importantly, the overflowing some write about may well be due to their not getting the plastic cone that holds the filter properly seated. Happened once to me but then I realized what needed to be done to prevent overflows. I think the coffee quality is excellent."
2,Cuisinart DCC-1100BK,"I bought this Cuisinart to replace my older model and was very disappointed. I wanted a 'hot' cup of coffee and this model didn't cut it (the older model did). I have now switched to the Keurig, which makes a hot cup every time; however, the pods are expensive. I would really like to find a coffee pot that makes my coffee hot!!"
1,Crapped out after 2 years,"After 2 years of very light use (2 times per week), this coffeemaker quit working. A search online found that it was common for the electronics to fry on Cuisinart brand coffeemakers. Expected more for the price. Won't buy Cuisinart again."
4,Cuisinart coffee maker programable,"It really is a cute coffee maker, it was easy to program ( no instructions, used). I do love it. The pink is perfect pink. I haven't made coffee or tea (why I bought it)from it. Yet, I need a new carafe. Mine was broke or was beat to hell in transit. They placed it in an over size box. Only 2 1/2 wraps of bubble wrap,and a few pieces thrown in literally! And the coffee maker beat the pot to death (RIP). Can you believe? they only used one piece of tape for a box 2'x3'. But I would recommend the maker. It's a Cuisinart! And the name says it all for me. I have had several pieces of Cuisinart and I have loved all of it."
4,Makes good coffee!,We have used Cuisinart for many years without issues so decided on this model for the office. Good prices (under $40 with a rebate). And of course easy to use and keeps coffee hot but not burnt.
1,Cuisinart DCC-1100 - D.O.A.,This coffeemaker made ONE pot then died. Does not get power at all. Completely dead. Very disappointing. I am returning it for a refund.
3,Died after 14 months,"Feature-wise, its a great coffee maker - timer, 1-4 cup setting, fill window on right, etc.Two Cons:SHORT LIFE: The unit died after 14 months. The clock ""freaked out"" - jumps ahead and shuts off randomly. Cuisinart replaced it under warranty. I had to pay shipping costs.POSSIBLE DRAWBACK: ""Alert Tone"" -- 5 beeps that sound when the coffee finishes brewing. Very loud, cannot be turned off. This may be an issue if you brew coffee while other family members are asleep.LOTS OF PRO's:- Water filter- Timer- Setting for 1-4 cups- Fill window on side (other models you must look down into chamber!)Note that fill chamber is on the right toward the back. A little awkward to fill with right hand, since you have to look around or under your arm. But you get used to it."
1,foot long cord,Can't tell you if it worked or not. I have already thrown it away. The cord on plug needed to be about foot and half to plug in my coffee and would NOT reach! Crazy.
1,Worst coffee pot ever - FIRE HAZARD!!,"I've had this pot no more than a year and have to say it's the worst pot I've ever bought, which is completely shameful given it's cost and particularly that Cuisinart products used to be top-shelf. This morning, after brewing a half-pot for my wife and I, I heard a popping noise coming from the kitchen, followed by the smell of melting plastic. Naturally I rushed into the kitchen, to find the coffee in the carafe starting to boil and the warming plate and surrounding plastic glowing red hot. Thankfully I had the remnants of Hurricane Isaac to bring the unit out into to quench the fire that was starting. Now my kitchen reeks of melted plastic."
1,Fire Hazard!!,"I have always loved the 'look' of this coffee pot; I love pink and up until today, it has worked really well. BUT, today I took a nap and came downstairs to the smell of a burnt tire in my kitchen. I discovered it was the coffee pot. It no longer works and smells strongly of burnt plastic. It is a funny coincidence that today I just got this month's Consumer Reports March 2012 magazine in the mail, and it had a whole article on appliance fires. It said these fires are getting more frequent and people should unplug appliances after each use. I had heard this in the past but ignored it. I will no longer ignore that advice. I am not sure if this one is having more problems than others but it appears that it is. I hate to write a bad review because I do like this coffee pot, but safety is more important than appearances. :-) For all of us who love a pink kitchen, do not leave it unattended or plugged in."
1,Electrical Melt-Down,"This was a great coffee maker for a year and a half before it had an electrical melt-down. If it had just stopped working, that would have been one thing, but to have a fire hazard is something else. After reading so many similar reviews, I am stunned that this product has not been recalled."
2,Loved it untiil it starting leaking,We really like this coffee maker but after about 2 months the carafe started leaking when we pour the water into the coffee maker. We cannot figure out why and since it has been more than 30 days we are unable to get a full refund or exchange. We were told the call teh company but am dealing with so many issues post hurricane Irene that i am prob not going to get toit. Too bad as it makes a good cup of coffee and is easy to use
2,"If you want something that lasts, this is not it","I purchased this product in Nov (about 9 months ago), and already the timer does not work, it brews the coffee at the set time but after brewing immediately shuts off. If I make the coffee and brew immediately, it shuts off after less than one hour (meant to wait for two).I would not purchase this maker again."
5,Excellent coffee!,"My husband and I love this coffee maker. The coffee tastes great, it is easy to program, the warmer keeps the coffee the perfect temperature and we are thrilled with the way it pours - into the cup and not all over the counter. I can't believe it took me so many years to get a great coffee maker! Worth every penny."
3,"Good coffee maker, but coffee not hot enough","The only complaint I have is the coffee does not come out hot enough. Other reviewers have said the same. I know coffee is not supposed to be boiling like tea, but it is already luke warm within about 30 seconds of pouring it from the carafe. Everything else about this coffee maker is great; programmer, auto shutoff, looks great, easy to clean, large carafe, etc. You don't need to buy the paper filters since it has a built in gold filter. And if you already have filtered water don't bother buying the charcoal filters. They seem a bit pricey and cannot be found in most stores. Since I'm not a hardcore coffee drinker, I will accept the fact that it's not perfect especially for $50. Still makes great coffee. Just the smell of coffee in the morning is enough to buy a programmable coffee maker."
5,wow a warranty that they honor!,"We got this in late October 2009. It leaks a lot as of late. Plus the self cleaning light is always on even after cleaning it. But the good news is we called them, on a Sunday morning!, they answered right away and quickly agreed to send us a free replacement! We only have to pay $10 to ship them back the old machine."
1,What a waste of money,"We bought our first one of these in December 2009. It made really good coffee, quickly, and was easy to program. We loved it. But the pump died just six months later, in June.So we went back for another one, figuring maybe we'd just got a lemon. The new one lasted THREE DAYS. The clean cycle light is always on, but no matter how many times we run it, the danged thing won't make coffee. It's going back this weekend.I had a Braun that made good coffee for 8 years. Since then, I've had a Mr Coffee that lasted less than a year, and two of these Cuisinarts, lasting 6 months and a week respectively. I'd welcome any suggestions for a replacement.We can put a man on the moon. Why can't we make a decent coffeemaker?"
3,Good coffeemaker with a few shortcomings,"This coffeemaker replaced a dead Krups. It makes very good coffee but it has a few design quirks that I think are going to be annoying in the long run. The coffee filter basket is not able to stand on its own, so you must fill it with coffee while it is installed in the unit. So, if you spill coffee it goes right into the unit. This is a problem because the inside of the tank area stays wet all of the time because the lid incorporates the water jet that sprays hot water on the coffee. The condensation stays in the machine and the whole thing stays wet. Also, the tank has a very small opening in which to pour the water, and the gauge on the side is very hard to read.I liked the Krups better, but their quality has deteriorated over the years and it seems that a Krups is only good for about two years before it croaks. We'll see if the Cuisinart is any better."
2,temporary coffeemaker,This coffeemaker looks good and provided good service for a bit less than a year and then gave up the ghost. I need a coffeemaker that will last for a few years so I will now look for one not made by cuisinart.
2,Maybe just my bad luck,"Bought this for my daughter and within a very short time it quit working....Cuisinart was VERY helpful and replaced the item with no problem. However, the same thing happened to the second one! I'm either jinxed or this coffee maker is just not up to the challenge of making coffee every morning!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this coffee maker in April 2010. Shortly after that, the finish on the heating plate started wearing away and looking like a 10 year old coffee maker. I make coffee once a day.I emailed Cuisinart asking if this was normal or if there was a recall. A week later I emailed and asked if anyone worked in customer service as I did not get a reply. I finally got a reply. After sending in all the information they requested I got an email stating that if I return it at MY expense AND include a check for $10.00, they will send me a new one. I can buy a new Mr Coffee with that money. What kind of warranty / service is this??Buy a different brand."
2,Nothing special,"I bought this model in 2008. It lasted just under 2 years. It just quit working-lights still came on, but it wouldn't brew, nor would the plate warm. It's not like it got moved around. It sat on the counter like most makers. Not what I would call a recommended purchase for the price. The coffee tasted about the same as any other coffee maker. I guess I expected more for the price and the brand name."
4,cusinart coffeemaker,great product. makes a great cup of coffee. carafe doesn't make a mess when you pour. am very happy with price and quality
4,Coffemaker,This coffeemaker works fine. The only portion that could be improved is the reservoir. It is a little cumbersome to pour a pot of water into the small reservoir without spilling some of the water. It makes good coffee. I have not used the programmable function yet.
1,Defective unit--boiled coffee,"I liked it a lot at first, although filling it is very difficult; too narrow a space. Now, after 4 months, the unit, left on keep warm for 3 hours, suddenly reheated so that the coffee was boiling rapidly and smelled horrible.When I called Cuisinart, they said they would send me a replacement, but would charge me shipping both ways. Since the product itself was defective, I don't think this is a fair policy. Shipping for the new unit is $10; for the return, who knows? $13 for priority mail? Also, I have to wait 7-10 business days for the new unit. I would certainly not do business with cuisinart again."
5,CUISINART COFFEEMAKERS ARE THE BEST,"I already have a Cuisinart coffeemaker, but when I saw this one and the great deal with the rebate, I bought one and put it away for future use. Then I went back and bought a second one for my son as a Christmas present and he thinks it's great. It makes a great tasting pot of coffee. The water filters make a big difference over other coffeemakers."
4,Great little machine,"After burning through countless coffee makers over the years, I finally decided to purchase something different. A condo we rented for vacation had this Cuisinart coffee maker in it and we fell in love!So glad I now have one of my own. It works like a charm and is very easy to use.I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone."
2,Very Disappointed,"I expected much more from a Cuisinart product. The inside collects and holds moisture and water for days. It drips and leaves coffee stains on the lid, on the back of the pot, and on the 'bobble thing'. The carafe is difficult to clean and does not drain dry. The gold liner leaves lots of residue and ugly looking coffee. This coffemaker also makes the counter top so hot that I am afraid that it is damaging. I would not recommend this purchase and I don't know WHY I am not returning it!"
4,Cuisinart DCC-1100BK,"This is a wonderful, reasonably priced coffee maker. Thecone-shape filter keeps the coffee grounds from spilling overwhen making a stronger coffee. The unit is solid, the carafehas a nice shape and size and the controls are easy to set. Onlyminus, hence the 4-star, is the clock does not light up.All in all a fine unit."
1,Really elegant,"I just got this today and it looks nicer than I thought. Shiny high quality black. I have not yet brewed anything i it but will tonight. I will do another review as I go along. Amazon shipment was fast and the item was intact and well packaged.Update. My coffee is not as warm as hoped in the 1-4 cup setting. at first it did now, less than a week later not so hot. Hmm.Avoid this clunker"
4,Cuisinart 12-cup Programmable White Coffeemaker,"I have been very happy with this product. It makes hotter coffee than my previouscoffeemaker, though my husband would still prefer his coffee hotter. One of thenegatives that I read about in the reviews said that the water reservoir openingwas very small. I haven't found it to be a problem. The opening is adequate in myopinion. The one drawback is the fact that you have to put a new water filter inthe machine every couple of months, which is a bit expensive, but I knew about thisbefore purchasing."
1,Cuisinart DCC-1100 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker,"I purchased a Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker model DCC 1100 four months ago. This coffee maker is a FIRE HAZARD!!! This morning, immediately after brewing, the unit started billowing smoke and making a crackling noise. As my smoke detector sounded, I grabbed the smoking coffee maker and threw it on my balcony. A few more minutes and it would have ignited into a full flame. I have now found a number of posts at [...] which describe the same problem. It seems that Cuisinart denies there is a problem and has not pulled the product from shelves. I stopped by two major department stores this morning (The Bay and Sears in Canada) to advise them of my experience, and asked them to consider pulling the coffee maker from their shelves. If Cuisinart will not listen to consumers, then I am hoping these stores will. Hopefully, someone will not have to die to finally get this coffee maker recalled."
4,Very Nice!,"I bought this after going thru a GE, black & decker, a few Mr Coffee's....I wanted to try something ""better"". It looks well made and attractive. I just got it today so I'll find out in the morning how it well it works. You can buy a piece of junk in a dept store and have it the same day or order a nice one for the same price (because Amazon has such good prices!) and wait a week....patience pays off! I'm hoping it will last longer than the rest. It does have a 3 yr warrenty so I'm keeping my fingers crossed! This time I did my research first and this is one of the few machines, that's reasonable in price and got 4-5 stars on several website reviews...that's gotta say something!"
5,Lives up to the good reviews,This Cuisinart DCC-1100 12 cup coffeemaker is everything I hoped it would be when I ordered it. I do not find it difficult to pour in the water as some people said. Coffee is very tasty and hot enough when brewed. I can pour a cup without dripping all over the place unlike the Braun that I replaced. I recommend it!
4,Wonderful coffeepot,Have had some Mr. Coffee pots previously but this one is byf ar the best we have. A nice HOT cup of coffee is ready when the audible beeper goes off. Only thing is the water reservoir is a bit small to fill which is why I gave it 4 stars but otherwise would recommend it to anyone.Great one.!
3,Sometimes Leaks,"This is a very good coffee maker except sometimes, for no apparent reason, aftercarefully filling the reservoir it leaks a small amount of water onto the counter.After repeated email to customer service they never replied. Stuck with a newcoffee maker that sometimes leaks...."
5,to the very last drop...,"ahhhh... good to the very last drop!!This is the best coffee maker I have owned.My coffee tastes great every time. I use non-chlorine water and quality coffees. I also remove the coffee grounds basket as soon as it quits brewing. My coffee stays hot, which was a complaint with my previous maker. It is easy to program. I have recommended this purchase to all of my family and friends."
4,It makes coffee,"This Cuisinart Coffee Pot makes perfectly fine coffee so no issues there. Just a couple of small things - the clock is entirely too small and really surprised that it is not backlit which means you cannot read it unless you really make an effort. I probably looked like some myopic nerd trying to set the programming times! And I agree with others - the spot for pouring in your water is really small - nothing insurmountable but you certainly have to pay a lot more attention to what you are doing. I do like being able to set the auto-off time as my old one did not have that and cut off after two hours which just wasn't long enough some mornings. This is a tall machine, so make sure to measure your space - it fits under my cabinet, but just barely."
2,This coffee pot is a dripper,"Cuisinart DCC-1100BK 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, BlackI value customer reviews but don't typically write many myself. Well, this coffee pot changes things.Unfortunately, this coffee pot is a dripper. Unless your each cup VERY SLOWLY, you will drip coffee all over your counter or floor.When you are in a rush or when you have guests visiting, this is a major nuisance.I would not buy this pot again."
1,"Went through 2 in 6 months, now have a Krups","Several weeks into using this coffee maker, the coating on the hot plate/burner started rusting and flaking off. Luckily the consumer protection laws in my state mean I could just return it to any store that sells the same model. I took back and, thinking I just got a lemon, exchanged it for a new one. Within 2 months, the exact same thing happened. I got a Krups and am much happier."
1,Not designed well,Worst designed coffee maker that I've owned. Display is small and not backlit. Water input is too small and difficult to fill. Water level indicator is at the the back right and I usually need to move the coffee maker to see it. Bought this model in December and replaced it in May because I was tired of the design shortcomings.
4,Cuisinart DCC-1100BK,"It brews a great cup of coffee. However we find that the the pouring spout leaks, and we end up with water all over the counter."
2,way too HUGE!!,"big, bold and beautiful... yes i love the pink! it does match my kitchen... BUT it's just so daggum BIG!!!! looks so gaudy and takes up way too much counter space... but the coffee is great!"
3,"Pink is great and the machine better than the Cook's, but","I love pink and the breast cancer awareness and funding (3%) is a nice idea. I have the Kitchenaid Java Studio which is so much better made. I have that in black with chrome. It does not look as nice, but this Cuissinart has a cheap control panel -- mine has noticeable flaws in the metal (raised like the metal was molded around a hair). It certainly looks better than the Cook's ($25 at JC Penney). The Java Studio is about $95, so one could say the quality and price go together. For me, I expect this coffeemaker to look less cheap even at $55. I am returning to await a pink Kitchenaid (if we ever get one)."
2,Very poor design,"LCD clock/timer display too small, not illuminated, in a bad position, and generally very difficult to read.Water tank hard to fill. Top is in the way.Filter holder does not stand up on counter so you have to hold the holder with one hand while filling it with coffee in the other hand. Very awkward.Doesn't tell you in advance you need the triangular shaped paper filters. And if you have never used them before there are several sizes so you have to dig through the instructions to find out it is a #4 filter.Coffee doesn't taste any better than from my cheap Walmart coffee maker.Top of caraff does not hing. You have to pop it off and it often flies out of your hands.This is the poorist design coffee maker I have ever owned and I have had many. Cannot believe it gets mostly good reviews. Makes you wonder."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"I BOUGHT THIS COFFEE MAKER IN RED THIS PAST JANUARY, 2009. WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF RECEIVING THE COFFEE MAKER IT BEGAN TO SOUND LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BLOW UP EVERYTIME I MADE COFFEE. I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT HATES TO RETURN SOMETHING I BOUGHT ON THE INTERNET PLUS THE FACT THAT IF I SENT IT BACK I WAS GOING TO BE WITHOUT A COFFEE MAKER UNTIL IT WAS RETURNED TO ME. IT IS NOW MAY, 2009 AND THE COFFEE MAKER HAS TOTALLY QUIT WORKING. THE SAD THING IS THAT MY LAST COFFEE MAKER WAS A CUISINART AND I HAD IT FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 YEARS WITH NO PROBLEMS, SO THIS WAS A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME AND MORE THAN LIKELY I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CUISINART PRODUCT."
2,Good Coffee - Bad User Manual!,"The Manual that comes with this coffeemaker should be rewritten by someone who has actually used it! There are almost no instructions for how to program it, and some of the basics aren't mentioned at all. (Like using the permanent filter and using the paper filters that are included -- do you use one or both?? I found out the hard way.) There are too many other omissions to list here. The coffeemaker does make good coffee, but I still haven't figured out how to program it to turn itself off, or how to set the clock, which is so small I can barely see it. I really miss my old Mr. Coffee that died after 6 years."
3,Love the brand but there's better choices,My major problem is the temperature of the hotplate. It burns the coffee if on over 2 1/2 hours. I have a very similar machine that cost $30 more at my house and it has temp settings and is worth the additional cash.
2,**UPDATED** Not bad for the price,"Updated after using for 1 month, I actually am returning the pot. It leaks from the lid everytime I pour over 8 cups.Cuisinart DCC-1100 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, is a little flimsy then other Cuisinart coffee makers I've had. It just feels cheap, no so strong, but it made a good cup of coffee this morning. We'll see how it holds up in 6 months."
2,More water on the counter than in the pot,"This coffee machine is fine as coffee machines go, except for one major issue: the pot spills water and/or coffee all over the place. I must keep a towel nearby for when I fill the coffee maker and for when I pour my cup of coffee. The manufactuters also didn't make the top of the machine open enough so that you can pour all of the water from the pot into the machine. For some strange reason - it's an angle thing - you are unable to pour the last of the water. The lid stops you from being able to turn the pot upside down to get the last of the water out (does that make sense?). This means that inevitably there is water left in the pot that I must throw in the sink so I don't have watered down coffee. Neat."
1,fire hazard,Purchased this coffeemaker 26 months ago. Travel a lot so only brewed a pot per day for about 400 days in that time (about 13 months). Worked fine until it started an electrical fire. Never had any other product as dangerous in my kitchen.
2,Started out ok,We have had this unit for about 6 months. It has started leaking water out of the bottom of the unit. Will not purchase another.
4,Solid but not exceptional,"It's a pretty good coffee maker, but really is not anything to write home about. The water filter on the maker was an attractive feature and I imagine it helps a bit, but it's a pretty lame design. It's a paper bag with (I assume) charcoal filter elements inside and it just hangs out at the bottom of the water tank. Not a robust design by any stretch.The rest of the maker is good and I'm glad we got a great deal on it - if I had spent the full $100 I would have returned it. It is worth $40 though!"
5,Coffee Lovers Dream,"I read all the reviews, and they are right!! This pot makes GREAT coffee, and that's what I want. Plus, you can't beat the price. After years of describing myself as a diehard Krups fan, I became discouraged with the downhill quality and uphill price of the product. Cuisinart has restored my faith in the coffeepot!!"
1,broken ! at 15 months,"Coffee maker broke after 15 months.Actually much worse than broke - started emitting very acrid smoke.A product like this should last a lot longer - and it was certainlya hazard - although no fire.September 11, 20010"
3,Great Coffee but it leaks!,"We have had our machine for over a year now. It makes terrific coffee, no doubt about it and we also like the carafe idea which eliminates the hotplate danger. However, the machine clogs up all the time and leaks coffee onto the countertop no matter how good we clean it. Even after washing the coffee filter and the basket holder and running water onto the carafe top it still backs up and leaks out onto the counter. We have a dish strainer on our countertop to channel the spilled coffee into the sink but this is getting very old! It leaks about 50 percent of the time even while we are watching it!"
3,Beware of warranty,"My Cuisinart coffeemaker, Model DC1100, stopped working a little over a year after purchase. It was under warranty so I called Customer Service. Yes, they did ship a new product to me, BUT I had to pay $10 for that AND they want me to ship the broken coffeemaker back to them at my own expense (which isn't going to happen). It seems to me that if a product fails during the warranty period the customer shouldn't have to pay anything to have it replaced. I will check warranties more carefully when I eventually replace this coffeepot."
1,Fire Hazard,"I purchased the Cusinart DC 1000 thru Amazon. It caught fire today. There has not been any recalls on either of these products but there are alot of complaints about fire hazards and overheating. Cusinart has been notified. PLEASE be careful if you have either of these products. Had my husband not been in the kitchen when it caught fire, no telling how much damage we would have had."
3,Very nice looking but has a strange taste,"I wanted this coffee pot in pink to go with all the other pink appliances in my kitchen. It looks very nice but has a very strange taste. Cuisinart includes a ""charcoal-filter insert"" that is supposed to remove bad taste in water (so they know about this problem).....but, I never have a problem unless I am using this coffeepot. My tap water and bottled spring water normally taste fine but as soon as I put ANY water in this machine there is a strange taste. This is with and without the charcoal filter. I can only assume at this point that it is something from the processing of the appliance that causes this. I will probably do a vinegar cleaning but don't know if it will help."
4,Cuisinart DCC-1100,"Couldn't ask for a better coffee maker. The Cuisinart DCC-1100 makes great hot coffee and is easy to use. Previously purchased a Cuisinart DCC-1150 which comes with a thermal carafe, but the coffee didn't get hot enough. (I didn't realize it didn't have a hot plate and I should have returned it.) As for both models, I ordered white so it would match my kitchen, but it would be nice if the top of the carafes didn't show the coffee drips so much."
4,Cuisinart DCC-1100BK,"I purchased this coffemaker in September of 2009. After about 6 months the original just quit working, the light would come on but nothing happened. I contacted the Cuisinart Corporation and they sent me a replacement (I had to return the old one to them at my expense). Approximately 2 years later after using the new coffeemaker daily, the clean light came on and it will not go off no matter how many times I clean the maker. After saying that, this is one of the best coffeemakers I have ever had, the taste of the coffee was better than from any other maker I have used. The coffeemaker still makes a pot of coffee in ten minutes or less; the clock is too small and recessed to be able to see easily, but is easy to set.Overall, the coffeemaker is easy to use, settings are easy to understand, and I have been mostly pleased with the product."
3,disappointed,I think the coffee maker works OK but not exceptional. The thing I really don't like is the difficulty in putting water in the water chamber. I like to use the carafe to put the water in and it is almost impossible to measure the correct amount in carafe and then pour in maker. I have to use a tea pot with a spout to get the water in. The lid needs to move back farther.
4,Happy with this one,"I've had a variety of coffee makers over the years, and am very happy with the Cuisinart. Makes great coffee. The glass carafe is also a lot more solid than others (e.g., Krups, which is too thin and easily cracks)."
2,"looks great, but lukewarm coffee","I thought I'd done a lot of research before I chose this coffeemaker, but I was disappointed. My first cup of coffee was barely drinkable, so I started checking the temp of each pot right after it finished brewing. The hottest reading I got was 165 degrees - well under the 185-200 degrees recommended range. I contacted Cuisinart and they said it should have been at 180, which is where they designed it.So, could be it was just a bad coffeemaker, but I couldn't recommend it. I returned it, ordered the Krups and am much happier."
1,Did Not last a year,Not worth the money it burned up this morning and filled the kitchen with smoke. Good thing I caught it before a fire.
1,There is a reason for the negive reviews,"There are better designed coffeemakers out there. Besides hearing a pop and having electrical smoke come from the unit after making the second pot of coffee... the maker is very, very difficult to fill (super small holes that require you to poor very slowly - big hassle) and very (just one very) slow compared to my old Braun, nor did I like the flavor of the coffee made. On the positive side the carafe poured with out drip and the unit is ascetically pleasing. That said, because of the electrical smoke I sent the unit back and would not want the same as a replacement. Not recommended."
4,"OK coffeemaker, but not the greatest",Makes good coffee. Don't like the small opening to fill water. Don't like the unable to read clock. Don't like that you have to take top off pot instead of flipping it up. Like the color. Like the markings on pot. Wouldn't buy again.
2,Coffee lover,"This coffee maker makes very good tasting coffee, HOWEVER, I have had two and neither one lasted much more than year. I returned the first dead one to the store and they replaced it. This one has lasted exactly 13 months. I suppose I could return it but I have had it with Cuisinart. I am ready to try another brand but WHAT?"
3,over-rated,I thought that buying an expensive coffee pot would guarantee having delicious coffee. It does not. Also the white plastic stains and is difficult if not impossible to keep white. I just bought a percolator (Presto) for which I will be able to use two thirds less coffee and I will get a nice hot steaming cup of rich coffee EVERY DAY....
3,It's fine,"I bought this to replace a Mr. Coffee that I had for several years but died from neglect I guess, since I never cleaned it, not even once. This Cuisinart is fine except the temperature is too high and there is no way turn it down which was one of the features that I really liked about the Mr. Coffee. Also, the clock is a very small unlit digital clock that is impossible to see unless I bend down to look at it. The Mr. Coffee had a nice lit dial clock. Also, the mode selection dial is hard to turn and the settings are hard to read as well. The Cuisinart does have a water filtering capability, but honestly, I cannot taste the difference between using filtered or unfiltered tap water. One good thing about the Cuisinart is that it brews pretty darn quick. I guess I'll stick with it for now but I do miss my Mr. Coffee."
1,Kaput,"A week after the warranty ran out so did the coffee pot. Just quit heating. Going back to cheap Mr. Coffee I can buy locally. They at least last 5 to 6 years. I can put up with a drip or two. Coffee tastes the same from Mr. Coffee, Cuisinart, or whomever."
3,My LAST Cuisinart,"This was my 2nd Cuisinart in less than a year, and after the first one (higher model) sprang a leak I pitched it and bought this one on sale. I bought it just a few months ago, and last night discovered THIS one was leaking as well. I removed the bottom this time, curious to see just what the issue was, and there is a crack in the soft rubber hose leading from the tank to the heating element...definitely a hazard, and evidently a reoccurring problem! No more Cuisinarts for me..."
4,It makes coffee,I got this coffee maker to replace a bunn. It works OK but it is a lot slower. I like that it comes with a water filter and a gold coffee filter. You really have to make sure you put the top on the carafe tightly or you can not pour water without spilling it. Sometimes the part that lets you pour coffee while it is brewing lets the coffee spill onto the warmer.
2,Worked great for 6 months then broke,It was great having a programmable coffeemaker and having fresh brewed coffee first thing in the morning. Until about 6 months after purchase when my wife and I came down to the kitchen to a huge water puddle on the kitchen coubnter and floor around teh coffee maker.An internal tube that carries the heated water up to the coffee ground had worked loose and now does so after every 2 to 3 pots of coffee.We no longer use the coffeemaker.I would NOT recommend this coffeemaker.
5,Great Coffeemaker,"This is a great, great coffeemaker. Anybody who has trouble using this one just isn't doing it right."
5,Fantastic coffeemaker,I have been extremely satisfied with the Cuisanart 1100 Programmable Coffee Pot. It is relatively simple to program with was a big plus. I enjoy the speed in which the coffee is made and beeps announce when it is done. The pot stays warm another hour and beeps when that time is over.
2,Not the greatest,"I have owned this coffee maker for only about 15 months, and it died this morning. It was used at most once a day during the period.Not only did it not last long, but the white color stains quickly from the coffee and cannot be cleaned. It was also hard to pour the water into the resevoir.Its good points are the ease with which you can set the controls and the size of the carafe. While it worked, it made good coffee.I will not repurchase this type of cofeemaker."
4,Great Coffee!,Hot and tasty! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars...the space you pour the water in is rather small.
4,Makes a good cup of coffee.,"I like this coffee maker. The only real negative is when we tried the timer we found that the machine is really loud while brewing. If you're already awake you don't notice it but if you set it to brew before you wake up, it will wake you up."
5,Great Coffeemaker!,"We are thoroughly enjoying this coffeemaker, especially with such a great price that included a rebate. It makes great coffee and is easy to clean and program. Love it!"
1,This coffee pot left a bad taste in my mouth,This Coffee pot is rather large. The water reserve is too small. I can't fill it when stored in my kitchen under my cupboards. I have to pull it completely away from the counter to fill water reserve.The lid thing was an issue for me. I actually never got to taste the coffee because there was a leak in the water tank. Made a mess all over. Had to pull everything out of my drawers and re-wash everything. I returned it and decided not to get another one and stick with my currant cheap Mr. Coffee Pot. Too much a hassle. The pink color was the ONLY plus.
2,Great coffeemaker...until it catches on fire,"I had this unit for about 10 months and it brewed a great-tasting, quick cup of coffee. Unfortunately, as I was recently brewing a cup, smoke starting pouring from the base of the unit. It appears the heating element shorted and caused the base of the unit to catch fire. I've seen a lot of people post similar reviews, and I'm surprised Cuisinart hasn't caught on. If you buy this coffeemaker, beware."
3,Makes good coffee...but,Water reservoir is small and difficult to reach. All the controls and time indication are small and very difficult to read. Carafe top isn't hinged and you must take the entire top off from the back to clean the pot.
1,melt down,Lasted less than two years before an internal malfunction - a nasty smelling smoke began wafting from it's guts - just happy it didn't burn down the house.
4,Caraffe is poorly engineered,"I think this is a good coffee maker, but has two flaws:1) The glass carafe is not designed in a way that makes it easy to pour the coffee into a cup when it's done brewing. There is no sloped lip where the coffee could easily pour out; instead, you have to almost turn the thing upside down completely.2) The clock is not back lit or fluorescent so it is basically worthless."
2,Poor design will drive you crazy,"On the plus side it makes good coffee (if you're careful), but so most coffee makers that heat water over grounds. The problem is in the design: the water reservoir and filter basket are right next to each other, so when the grounds get dumped into the filter basket, some inevitably spill into the water reservoir = bad coffee.Another major annoyance: the lid to the reservoir doesn't tilt all the way back. Because the reservoir hole is so close to the lid hinge, it's a real pain trying to pour the water in there, and you can never get all the water out of the carafe into the reservoir.Not sure who designed this coffee maker, but it wasn't someone who drinks coffee everyday. Look elsewhere."
1,Didn't last long,"I bought this coffee maker in September 2009 based on good reviews on this website. However, this week I was awakened from a nap with my wife saying she smelled something electrical burning. Not a good way to wake from a nap! The smell filled the entire lower floor of our house. You can imagine our relief, after frantic searching, to find out that it was the coffee pot, not the wires in our wall.Needless to say, I am disappointed with this coffeemaker. I understand that it's possible to get a lemon on even the best products, and it had worked well up to that point. However, I thought this significant enough to report. You make your own decision"
1,Thank goodness for warranties!,"I purchased this coffee maker in December, 2008, based on consumer comments. Six months later, water poured into the coffee maker spilled out the bottom onto the counter. After calling Cuisinart, they agreed to honor their warranty by sending us a replacement, as long as we returned the faulty product. We have received the replacement in a timely fashion, however, we are expected to pay return postage which will probably exceed $10!"
5,Red filtered coffee pot,"I needed a coffee pot to match the decor of my kitchen, and this red programmable Cuisinart is perfect. This coffee maker also has an extra filter to clean the water before it perks. We have well water and needed an extra filter at times."
3,Makes great coffee BUT,The opening to pour in the water is not very big BUT the real drawback are the annoying five beeps it makes when the coffee is ready. It sounds the same as the house alarm.
5,Lots of Extra's Coffee Maker,"I am so pleased with our new coffee maker! It's fast, makes piping hot coffee, and has little extra features that I really like. It beeps when your coffee has finished brewing. It has a light that lets you know when the machine needs cleaning and has a cleaning cycle. It has many other helpful features. The instructions were easy to read and follow and I've had no problem filling the resivoir with water from the pot. The pot is dripless and I'm also able to use my old coffee filters with it. Plus the pink color goes great in my kithen.I'd highly recommend this coffee maker. Enjoy....."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this model because it is the same kind we have at work, and that one makes very good coffee and is easy to use. I followed the instructions regarding initial cleaning and setup, plugged it in, and nothing happened. No lights, no activity of any kind -- wish I had tried plugging it in before going to all the trouble of getting it ready to use. I am going to try returning it for a replacement, since Amazon is generous about allowing returns for defective items. I hope Cuisinart Quality Control isn't slipping, and that I have better luck with the next one. Interesting, though, that another buyer reported the same experience when they purchased this model last summer."
3,Don't buy it here.,"This was a replacement. I had this coffee maker four years and wanted a new one. I should have been suspicious when i saw the price is much less than a dept. store where i got it last time.The on- off button does not work on my new one. I'll think twice about getting appliances here, i wonder if this was a second."
2,"It makes coffee, but the taste... ugh","There is nothing mechanically wrong with this coffee pot: grinds in, water in, coffee out. But I've been suffering through the taste for weeks. First, it's too hot. And I add alot of cream and it's still too hot. It's the kind of hot where you don't even taste the coffee, you just taste the hot, if that makes any sense. No matter if I put less grinds or more grinds there is something about the taste that just doesn't access the good taste of coffee. I drink flavored coffee and I can't taste that. I'm going to sell this one on cragislist and go back to a Mr. Coffee, which has always delivered me a good cup of coffee."
4,I Am Pleased with this Coffeemaker,"I purchased this coffee maker to replace a Bunn machine that developed a leak after three or four years of use. This coffee maker has a clean design, it is easy to use, and it brews a good, hot cup of coffee. I like that I don't need to purchase paper filters and that this machine requires about 15% less coffee than the Bunn to brew coffee the way we like it. Also, I do not use the water filters that are available for this machine, and I am completely pleased with the results."
4,Great budget friendly coffee maker,"I bought this for myself after going through two cheap coffee makers in 6 months. This machine definitely isn't the fanciest or most expensive, but it gets the job done. I like the 1-4 cup setting (it super heats the water for the smaller amount of coffee) and the fact that you can program both the brew time and the length of time before it shuts itself off. I'm taking away a star for the annoying beeping sound it makes when it's done brewing (you can't turn that off) and because it uses water filters that aren't cheap. The small opening to pour the water into hasn't been an issue for me."
2,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this based on the raving reviews. It was great from November until January and then just disappointing. Without any warning, water would not leave the reservoir. I lost coffee for 12 cups (Ethiopian Yirgachaffe, so I was not pleased). I unplugged it and waited a week or so before trying again. It made sounds as if coffee was brewing or water heating, but the water remained in the reservoir. I only used bottled reverse osmosis water, so I doubt there was mineral buildup. I also cleaned the included gold filter thinking perhaps it was clogged. Nothing. I have a Cuisinart 4-cup brewer that has been successful and going steady for about a year. I expected the same with the 12 cup. I am glad it happened within time limit to return, however I am still left at a loss for brewing large quantities."
2,"Dead, already?",Bought this coffeemaker in red to match my kitchen in Jan '08. Coffee quality was fine. The pot leaked a bit under the top band but we dealt with it. This morning it just died. We'll be attempting to contact Cuisinart to see what we can do.
5,Coffee break,"Good all around coffee maker. Fits nicely under the cupboard, makes a decent cup of coffee and keeps the coffee hot during and after brewing. Automatic shut off after 2 hours is a bonus. Have not programmed it to start on its own,as it is not necessary for my use."
4,Well designed,"This Cuisinart coffee maker efficiently does what it was designed to do, with several conveniences. The price was reasonable. I like the ""gold foil filter"" which eliminates the problem of buying and storing paper filters."
2,"Fast, but too many design flaws","As with most all Cuisinart coffeemakers, I have three big gripes:1) the filter basket is hard to lock in place and it's also hard to know when it IS locked into place (and since the basket's the same color as the rest of the machine, it's also hard to know its even there). If the filter basket is not correctly positioned and locked, the basket will overfill and you'll have a terrible, wet mess;2) Cuisinart, in its wisdom, refuses to position the water reservoir in the front of the machine, and instead, positions it in the back up against AGAINST THE lid where it is difficult to position the carafe to pour without spilling;3) when the lid is opened for cleaning after brewing, the condensate drips down the back of the coffeemaker near the electrical plug at the base.Like I said, it's a fast machine. But I wouldn't buy one. This was a gift."
1,didn't even get to use it!,"I was going to run a cycle of water through as per the instructions - to clean out the machine. Well, 100% of the water that I put in the machine RAN OUT THE BOTTOM of the unit! It ran out almost as fast as I poured it in - all over the counter top! It's going back but what a pain to have to send it back! Didn't even want to give it one star!"
3,Mostly good,"I haven't tried the programmable function, so can't comment on that. The machine works and doesn't take up much space on the counter, which I was looking for. I miss the 'slow brew' function I had on my previous machine because I have to use a little more coffee to get a good, rich result. Another thing I was concerned about was the ability of the carafe to pour without getting liquid all over the place (my old carafe had to be used over the sink. This one pours well with the lid off, but sometimes if you tip the pot too quickly with the lid on, the stream with hit the lip of the lid and suddenly change direction - redirecting the flow forward by about two inches. This means you'll be filling your cup and all the sudden the coffee overshoots the edge of the cup and is pouring onto the floor (or your fingers). Probably a useful feature for someone who need to learn to slow down anyway."
1,Don't do it,"I am sad to say that I had this coffee maker. It just quit working one day, the warmer stopped warming and the pot would brew but then turn everything off. Well, I had the carafe, since they are pretty expensive to replace , I thought I would just get the same pot. Amazon did a great job, and I had it within 48 hours of my order. I excitedly plugged it in and brewed a pot, and guess what? It did exactly the same thing as the old one. Brewed and turned it self off. So, back it went and I opted for a less expensive MR Coffee."
2,Still hoping for a great cup of coffee,"After reading many reviews on many coffee makers, I finally decided to go with this Cuisinart. I had to retire our Krups after 8 years and was eager to get a really good cup of coffee with a new coffee maker. After only two pots, I regret buying this model. It comes out much hotter than our Krups, but lacks the deep flavor I used to get with my old maker. I am using the recommended amount of grounds and filtered water so I expected to have delicious coffee. I would return it but for the hassle of repackaging it so I will live with it and keep looking in the meantime."
2,It should last longer!!!!!,"This does produce a good cup of coffee and thus the reason for the 2 stars. I purchased this item on March 8,2010 and it broke on September 19, 2010. I understand that it is under warranty but I have to pay shipping back and ALSO, I have to include $10.00 shipping so they can ship it back to me! It's not worth it to me so I'm going to order a Bunn coffee maker and be satisfied once and for all. Never again Cuisinart!!!"
3,style over substance,"i bought this coffeepot even though it didn't have any reviews because i thought it looked cute and that the cuisinart brand was quality. unfortunately, i've had a lot of problems with this coffeepot and now i'm kicking myself for not going with one of the other better-reviewed ones. first, i find the tiny hole you have to pour the water into kind of awkward. my boyfriend doesn't, but i do - if you don't pour the water in just so it spills everywhere. in addition, sometimes when i try to pull out the carafe midstream to pour a cup (it SHOULD pause) it doesn't pause and it just keeps spewing out coffee and it starts sizzling/smoking when it hits the bottom (and once you put the carafe back it gets even worse). and it takes FOREVER to dry - even if i leave it open all day it's STILL wet at night.despite these problems, about 60% of the time it works OK and i have no complaints, it looks cute, and it has a great timer feature that brews your coffee for you in the morning."
3,filling water tank problem,"My significant other wanted a white coffee maker to go with the white toaster. On the whole, the coffee maker is good. However, I'm annoyed daily when I try to put the water in. The opening to fill the tank is very small. I used to pour the water directly from our Brita pitcher into the tank of my former Mr. Coffee. It's an impossible feat to do without spilling water on this Cuisinart. If i use the carafe, I can't quite get all the water out of the carafe. Also, what were they thinking by putting the view of the tank level on the right. If one is right handed, you can't see the level of water, (and if you're left handed i imagine it's worse)."
4,Its OK,"Was just a little dissapointed when we recieved this coffee maker. I did my research and no where could I find ( even the Cuisinart web site ) that it has a auto shut off, I was looking for one that didn't. But all in all its a pretty good maker. Could be a little eaiser to pour water into and the drip from considation is a pain and it isn't the fastest coffee maker i have ever owned. but it makes a decent cup of coffee and is easy to operate.Up-date on my 3 year old review. The coffee maker is still making good coffee which for me is something. As a rule a go through a coffee maker in one year, they are on pretty much all day. Have to say now I would recommend it to anyone."
4,For coffee lovers,This Cuisinart Coffee Maker is great. It makes good tasting coffee and looks great on the countertop.It is not as tall as some others and fits under my cupboards with a little room to spare.I liked the moderate price also.
4,Design flaw,"Works well, EXCEPT there's a flaw in the design. You can't fully empty the pot into the top of the coffeemaker. The lid lifts to ninety degrees, no farther, and the pot collides with the lid. No matter how you try, there's always a tablespoon or two of water left in the pot to dilute your coffee. And to get rid of it you have to take off the lid of the pot completely. It would be better if it simply flipped back. Otherwise a nice product."
4,"Loud, but works well","Bought this coffee maker solely for the feature that allows me to program the auto-shut off to 0-4 hours. I get up much earlier than my husband and the standard 2-hours isn't enough. This coffee maker is quite loud as it brews, especially at the end. I can live with that. It makes very good coffee and keeps the coffee very hot. Maybe too hot given how long we like to keep it warming. As the coffee level lowers, the coffee gets almost a starbucks type burned flavor, if you know what I mean. This might be a good thing for some.Just wanted to update. We have had this for about five months now and it is still working just fine. No issues like some have reported with overheating, etc. We don't use it more than a couple of times a week though."
1,Horrible coffee pot!,This coffee pot went bad within about 3 months. It doesn't even get used once a day! Thankfully I was home when it messed up because we were just sitting here and started smelling an electric burning smell. Turned out to be the coffee pot and it wasn't even turned on!
4,mostly happy,"We bought this based on reviews after our much loved Krups finally bit the dust. We have used it for a couple of months now. I am very pleased with the quality of coffee it makes. However, the size of the opening for pouring in the water and the carafe lid design are both pretty inconvenient."
5,Best Coffee Ever!,"I thought I might be taking a chance buying a coffee maker that was listed as 'used', expecting something that might have a few scratches or flaws, but I was very pleasently surprised to receive a product that appeared to be brand new. Not a scratch, smudge or even a fingerprint to be seen, the coffeemaker seemed to be still in its original un-opened packaging and even the fragile glass carafe was in perfectly new condition. But did it work? I plugged it in, cycled plain water through it to flush out any plastic taste, then set it up to brew my regular coffee for the next morning. First thing I noticed when I walked into the kitchen the next morning was the aroma, fresh hot coffee already brewed and smelling better than ever! And not only did it smell better, it tasted better than the same coffee brewed in my old coffee-maker which had finally played out. Five stars for good delivery, excellent product and best value for the money!"
1,Burning coffee maker,Purchased Jan of 2011. This morning the unit overheated spreading smoke throughout our home. Lucky I hadn't gone for a walk as usual. Obviously the 1100 model has a serious flaw. don't buy one until the co figures it out.
5,Very Happy,I bought this coffeemaker based on the reviews I read on Amazon from other purchasers. It is very easy to use. I noted that some people said they felt the area where you fill it with water was somewhat awkward and small. I use a separate pitcher to fill it and also pull it to the front of the counter when filling. No problem at all. I would definitely recommend this coffeemaker and feel it is worth the price.
4,Consistently makes good coffee,"I'm a fan of the cone filter style like this Cuisinart has vs. the flat-bottom Mr.Coffee style. I found it easier to program than some units, but the only down side is that it's awfully easy to get water into the coffee holder while you are filling the reservoir with water from the carafe. So you'll want to fill the reservoir, let the spilt water drip into the empty carafe, then empty the carafe and return it to the base, then insert the paper cone (or use the gold one... what a mess to clean, I would guess), and finally add the ground coffee. A bit quirky, but I've got the routine down. Once the coffee is brewed, it doesn't drip when you pour unless you're really in a rush. Anyway, this is a reliable coffee maker that consistently makes good coffee."
4,Great cup of coffee!,"Amazon was having a great deal on coffee makers and we were looking to replace our BUNN. We love this coffee maker! It makes a great cup of coffee. Our favorite feature is the small pot brew. If you only need 1 to 4 cups it heats the water extra hot so even the small pots taste wonderful. We have not found that filling it is a problem.I don't know why others are having problems but we just take the top off the carafe, fill it from the side and its ready to go. You don't even need the carafe to fill it. It has a water measure on the side of the unit itself. We highly recommend this Cuinsinart."
1,Cuisinart DCC1100 12-Cup Coffee Maker,"I have had this Coffee Maker approximately 5 months. Although I always use the same amount of coffee and water, sometimes the coffee is pretty good and other times it is very weak.Luckily I placed the coffee maker on one of those flexible cutting boards to protect my counter. It's a good thing I did because the bottom of the coffee maker has completely rusted. If I hadn't placed the mat under it, my white formica counter would have been ruined."
1,electrical fire provides morning excitement,"I bought one of these about 6 months ago. It made great coffee twice per day until it suddenly caught fire and filled my home with noxious smoke. Normally, the machine brews coffee and keeps it warm afterward. But today, it brewed the coffee, quietly warmed it for about half an hour, then erupted in a noisy and foul smelling electrical fire.If you are looking for a small home appliance that might someday burn your house down, killing you and your entire family, then look no further. This is the coffee maker for you."
4,Practically Perfect Cuisinart DCC-1100 12 Cup Coffeemaker,"This coffeemaker makes excellent coffee and is made for no-fuss cleaning simplicity. It would be absolutely perfect, though, if the pot's white plastic rim were glass and the lid were stainless, so I didn't have to wipe it after each pour to try to keep it from staining. It's probably a futile effort, but I hate stained plastic, and my kitchen is white. A no-plastic pot would give this product six stars in my book. Also beware that the snap-on lid must be on when brewing to avoid a big mess."
1,Less than two years old and dead as a door nail,"I was happily making coffee every day. I was fine with the unit until this morning when I woke up and all signs of life on the coffee maker were gone. Wouldn't brew coffee and there wasn't any indicator in the timer slot so that wasn't working. Basically, something very key seems to have worn out. I guess I'm lucky. After reading many of the other negative reviews here, that it didn't catch on fire. But, I expect YEARS of service out of a coffee maker. Is that too much to ask? This purchase was me, upgrading from my old Mr. Coffee. Guess that was a mistake. I'm very disappointed and now have to go out and get a cup of coffee."
4,Cuisinart Coffeemaker,"This coffeemaker features a push button on/off switch vs the toggle switch of the more expensive unit. (It was the toggle switch that went bad within 3 yrs in the more expensive unit - the DCC-1200).I do like the top on this unit better, as it's made thicker and seems sturdier. I also appreciate that it includes the scoop, a permanent gold tone filter, a water filter w/ the 1st charcoal filter provided, and some white coffee filters. Other low cost makers may not include a scoop, much less a water filter.UPDATE 2/20/2013 Just 10 months after purchase and there's a problem with pouring a cup near the end of brewing time. It should stop brewing a few seconds and then resume when the carafe is replaced on the burner. However, it's continuing to run non-stop, so now I have to wait for the brewing to completely finish before pouring. I wrote Cuisinart yesterday and by this morning heard back that they are sending me a new filter basket. I hope that solves the problem!"
1,fire,Have had this coffeemaker for 9 months. It was zapped by something electrical and started smoking. I am just grateful that I was home at the time and noticed a pungent electrical burning plastic smell. I see that many others have had the same problem with this coffeemaker. It really should be recalled. The potential for diasaster is just too great.Have also read that Cuisinart has been less than helpful regarding this problem.
2,"Bad for the Maker, OK for the Drinker","Wife got me this for Christmas. Long time coffee maker and drinker. This machine is DIFFICULT for the maker. Fill hole is small, funnel for grinds MUST be in place to fill (cannot set on counter, must be installed in machine), no hinge on pot (must remove lid on pot to fill) and don't EVEN have wet fingers when changing from 'Auto On' to 'Brew' (or any other setting) in order to turn on the machine. Oh...and the pot's design will not let anyone pour all 12 cups (except into the sink). Next time, I will return to my favorite, Braun."
3,Cuisinart Coffeemaker (1100BK),I purchased this coffeemaker for my daughter and son-in-law as a Christmas gift. The price was spot-on and I was thrilled to see how nice the product looked. Its function is yet TBD but I hope they enjoy many years of good use!
5,Great coffee maker!,"This is the best coffee maker I've ever used, I didn't know that filted coffee can be this delicious , and it is very easy to clean."
4,Good choice,"I am happy with this coffee maker. It is an improvement over the previous one in which the water level could not be seen. Easy to use, all the now standard bells and whistles, and the coffee tastes good."
5,Cuisinart Coffemaker (Red),"This product works as described. It is easy to use, easy to program, and easy to clean. This coffeemaker makes a pretty good cup of coffee. For the price, it would be hard to beat.I would say that if you need a coffeemaker that is Red, to match everything else in your kitchen, you can not go wrong with this one."
4,Good Coffee Maker,Based on the reviews I purchased this coffee maker. After several weeks I am very satisfied.
5,Best Coffee Maker,So far this happens to be the best coffee maker I have ever owned. Goodbye Mr. Coffee!!
5,Good job!!!,"As for me, I was expecting something like ""Tears don't lie"",king of instrumental rave. But I've found it even better. It's a great song in great remixes. Actually Mark Oh is too hard to find in USA. And I'm happy that I bought this CD single."
4,Good tires for the price.,"They're not a bad tire for $6.95. They're not very thick. They might not last that long. I would suggest a pricier tire for any long distance biking. These are good for the neighborhood, or a park."
4,"Good tire, smoth ride.","This is a good tire. The ride is smooth and quiet. It has enough traction for unpaved trail riding.My only complaint is that it is only rated for 40 psi. Higher pressure reduces rolling resistance. I run mine at 50 psi, I'm not sure how much they will really take."
2,A complete flop,"The theory behind this product is great, but it was a complete flop for my chair. I ordered the slipcover in cocoa, loved the color, but could not tuck the material enough to make it look even remotely decent. It looked like my chair was wearing a moo-moo. As another reviewer mentioned, it was so huge that it could fit a loveseat. It's being returned..."
3,"Excellent book, but with huge oversight","This is an excellent book which I found hard to put down. However, I kept waiting for him to discuss the most basic problem which underlies most of the other serious problems on this planet, i.e., uncontrolled human reproduction. He might also have discussed the role played by religions such as Roman Catholicism, Christian Fundamentalism and Islam, in worsening the population explosion, by condemning birth control."
4,Book is interesting,"Well written, definitely some criticisms of Davis's style, but it is accessible and raises a lot of questions about personal responsibility, lifestyle choices, and hazards geography."
2,Drinking from a firehose,"OK Mike. Slums are bad, there are too many of them & the growth is incredible. I wanted a bit more about life in these places & a little more focus. My attention is demanded in Lima, Kenya, Rio & back again, all in a single page.Tremendous & frightening data. May as well have sent a spreadsheet."
5,Great book,Another great read by Mike Davis. He gives a realistic view on the impact of urbanization on the world. He sheds light on issues that many would prefer to stay in the dark such as poverty and a large formal and informal urban underclass that continues to grow exponentially.
2,useless,"This item did not at all stay on my smallish to average size nose. Worse, it is formed with a center ridge that actually cut into my flesh until I used a nail file to smooth it down. Its elastic was too small, also, to be very useful. When I dropped it in the pool, I could barely see it--a bright color would be better."
4,Not my type of reading.,"I give it a (4) star because according to my instructor, the book was really good, but I do not care for it."
2,"Jargon, anyone?","This was a really, really irritating book, because I was sure he knew better. He packed his text with needless jargon, plus dozens of acronyms made up just for this book, many of them so nearly alike that it's hard to remember which one means what. If that weren't bad enough, just when he comes to a critical piece of information, he writes, ""you'll find this in my previous book,"" or ""I'll cover this in my forthcoming book."" There are a lot of diagrams, and they are easier to understand than the text--at least the acronyms are labeled--but they could have been a lot better as well.The topic is vital. Nothing prevented the author, Richard Barrett, from writing a really good book. Maybe he thought clarity would hurt his credibility.In short, while there is some valuable information in the book, he makes you struggle for every bit of it. If you have to read jargon every day in the course of your job, maybe his won't especially bother you, but I found it infuriating."
3,Needs work,"Nicholas von Hoffman is a brilliant columnist who, if this book is any indication, should stick to shorter-format works. CITIZEN COHN is fact-packed, and has some well-drawn anecdotes, but overall it is an unwieldy and disorganized tome. Von Hoffman jumps forward and back in time, in an almost stream-of-consciousness style, which bogs down the narrative and muddies the chronology of events he recounts. In the space of one paragraph, he darts from 1954 to 1980-something and then back to 1964, bringing in a parallel but unrelated incident involving entirely different players.If you have a lot of time on your hands, and access to a high-speed internet connection to provide additional context for his stories, this great lump of a book can help kill a few hours here and there, but to someone who admires von Hoffman's usual style, it was a serious disappointment."
1,You don't get what is in the pictures,"I received the skins after approx. a month and they were not the ones shown in each picture with ribs on the sides. I ordered them specifically because of what was shown as I had a black one already and love it. Instead,I got the four skins that fit very loosely, causing the triggers to hang up more than half of the time, the rubber is super thin, and they aren't comfortable to hold. I was told I could mail them back, which would cost as much as I paid for them, and wait another month to possibly get the same thing again, or they would refund 20% of my payment, or basically $1.08. The customer service dept took about a day to respond and was very courteous, but I have not been happy with any part of the transaction whatsoever."
5,Nice touch,These controller skin add so much life to my controller. also I can easily identify controller 1 & 2; love it!
4,Kind of flimsy but still good,"The material and build feels kind of flimsy.But it fits the PS3 controller just right, getting it on wasn't too hard, and the value can't be beat.It makes gripping the controller much more comfortable.I was originally gonna only use the black one, but the ""blue"" isn't really a blue, it's more like silver/blue/grey and IMO looks really cool.Shipping was ok. Good product.4/5-D"
4,good buy,"as others have said, you get four skins. the ones i got were not the same ones in the pics. they work the same just not as cool looking. fit is good. they will give you more grip. the hotter your hands are the gripper they become."
4,This are not the one in the photo!,"This ones are not the ones they give you, but the ones they give me are cool and i like it soo if you want a confortable controller this are the ones that you want..."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping to get a similar skin to the Psyclone brand, which are excellent skins, however that is not how it is. First off, these skins are not the same as pictured in the product advertisements. That isn't a very big deal however, the pictures lead you to believe that you're going to get side grips. Well you don't. Second, these skins don't grip as well as the Psyclone skins--these feel almost slick in your hands. Thirdly, they are not built as well. The Psyclone skins are thick and feel durable. These are very thin and I felt as if they were going to break as I tried to fit them over the controller.In the end I took this skin off my controller and gave the others away. For the price they aren't bad however, there are better skins to be had--Unfortunately it's looking like the Psyclone brand is no longer being sold! :("
4,Just wondering,I am thinking about buying these grips i just wonder if they would offer any shock protection i dont drop my controler that often but it would be nice to know if i did nothing would happen to my controler i hate it when my controler gets the rattles.
1,"DO NOT BUY!! ITEM SENT WAS NOT ITEM PAYED FOR, YOU WILL GET CHEAP ONES INSTEAD","THE SILCONE CASES SENT WERE NOT THE SAME AS PICTURED AND THE ONES I PAYED FOR. THEY DID NOT HAVE THE GROVE ON THE SIDE AND THEY CUT OUTS WERE AN UGLY OCTAGON LOOKING SHAPE NOT ROUND AS PICTURED. THE RED AND BLUE CASE DONT EVEN HAVE SAME COLOR AS PICTURED, THESE ARE MUCH BRIGHTER AND NOT VERY EASY ON THE EYES. VERY UGLY CHEAP LOOKING CASES. DONT BUY , STAY AWAY!!!"
4,Look at how much they cost!,"You are pretty much paying 1 dollar for each skin... it can't get much better than that.You can see that it was not made to look beautiful, but it works just fine in appearance. You have ""leftover"" plastic on them, but nothing that will make you lose a game :).It will protect your controller from dust, sweat (where it covers :P), but not from a rage moment...They are easy to put on and take off. However, they do not look like that. The grips are far from what its shown in the picture. Still, as long as the controller is wearing this skin, I doubt it would move in your hands even if you sweat (A LOT).Now if you are OCD about it, just search for another cover. If you don't mind, get it because it is worth it."
3,Pretty good,These covers are pretty cool. They fit exactly and feel great. The downside is that the pictures on the site are wrong. The covers are actually more simple. But good. One glad I bought them what a great price
4,Good for the Price,"I received three of the controller skins: red, black, and blue. They were different than advertised, but they're still good. They make it hard to lose grip and prevent scratches on the controller."
3,Good item but not the same as in picture.,I did not receive the same product that is in the advertised picture. That being said the product that I did receive was a satisfactory silicone case. It did help with my sweaty hands slipping. If you have the nyko chargebase2 this skin make it difficult to drop the controller in the charger slot. The product you receive is good but I rated it a three because it was not the product that was advertised in the picture.
1,The worst I`ve ever buy..,"In your description of the product it says:Product DescriptionCombo Set Includes: 2 x Black Silicone skin case for Sony PS3 Controller, 1 x Blue silicone skin case for Sony PS3 Controller, 1 x Red silicone skin case for Sony PS3 Controller. Compatible with: Sony PS3.I only recive one black (u say TWO)The picture of the product is not what I get! Awful silicone skin...."
4,Low price for nice product,"I ordered this silicon protection for my play station 3 controllers.It fits perfectly and it is made of soft material to avoid scratches on the controller and on your hand.I am happy with it.PS. If you like to feel the original plastic of the ps3 controller, it is not recommended for you."
4,Skin Case PS3,"These ps3 controller skins are great, especially for someone who hates getting a sweaty controller or playing with people who eat while playing (I hate that). These things do a good job of fitting nicely in your hands so that there is no noticing it unless you look down at it. The reason I gave it 4 stars was that the bumps ""grippies"" on the sides could have been a little more pronounced."
1,Item sent NOT one in the photo.,"Either they know it and send it either way, or they just dont know they are showing the wrong photo. They send the WRONG item not the one shown in the photo. The one they send is a cheap dotted one that barely fits the controller. in fact you have to take a little knife to make it fit perfectly."
4,"Decent fit, not the same as pictured","The item I received is not the same as the one in the picture. If you're specifically looking for those grooves on the site of each hand, you won't get that. The skins I received have small dots on the side, which don't really help that much for grip. But my hands don't get so sweaty to the point where the controller literally drops from my hands. The red is also not that deep, and is more of a transparent red. Same for the blue--a bit transparent.I purchased this because I was afraid that a white controller would turn brown with sweat.Putting on the skin feels a bit scary that you might rip it, but I haven't ripped one yet. The skin feels comfortable to play with, but the fit isn't quite there. The center is a bit too long, so it will lift from the surface of the controller. So overall, this item is good for the money, but isn't very snug."
1,Breaks while putting on contoller,"Recieved the product and was very happy with the look but one did not fit the contoller snug and another broke as it was being put on a controller, very upset with the quality and I would not recommend these to anyone."
4,"Sony PS3: 2 black, 1 blue and 1 red remote covers","Great price. If you are buying skins for you PS3, buy these 4. I bought them because I thought they would be able to absorb a little bit of impact if the controller was droped. Unfortunitaly, they are too thin to cushin a fall but they feel good and protect from scratches."
4,great textbook,"I have really enjoyed this book (as much as a textbook can be enjoyable). It is concise, well-written, and to the point. Information is intelligently arranged so it is easy to reference and look things up. There are also lots of care plans included to help you out with clinical paperwork. My only gripe with this book is that the glossary is kind of puny- so if you don't know what something is (and there are lots of words in OB that you won't hear anywhere else) then you have to go back to the index and flip through the chapters to find where that thing is talked about in the book."
2,Not very helpful,I've found this book to be a very difficult read. The chapters are long and boring and it's very difficult to find information on a specific topic by using the glossary. I've found it more helpful to go online and research topics than to use this OB text. Avoid this book if you can.
5,I found the cookware!,"I first purchased this cookware at a store closing in Maryland. I really hated the fact that I didn't buy more pieces. There were stockpots, that I wished I purchased.But, this product is great, great enough for me to take a considerable amount of time to research and luckly find at the Amazon.com website. I would purchase more and give as gifts, if I could find the sets and accompanying other cookware (larger stockpots).I LOVE THIS SET!"
5,Absolutely the best pans ever!,"This is a fabulous set of pots and pans. It cooks evenly, can be used on medium or high heat. And I like that it came with 3 saucepans, 1.5 qt, 2.5 qt, and 3.5 qt. The 7 qt has made many great soups and stews. It's heavy for stainless steel, to me it's comparable to the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro line. It can go into the oven up to 500 degrees, the handles are firmly welded and there are no nonstick parts to it.I got mine from Overstock dot com, and at the time it did not have the 8"" skillet nor the covered saute pan. I wish they were part of the set. And now it's discontinued. Too bad, I wish they'd bring it back. Also these pots can be used on my induction hotplate, which is fantastic as that's how we do hotpot and sukiyaki at home."
1,Worst Sudoko Game Ever,I had gone to the store to buy a casino game but I saw this one for $9.98 and couldn't pass it up. It is not worth anything. Putting it on the DS seemed to be an afterthought. It does not use the touchpad for any usefull purpose. It is faster to use the buttons. I was hoping it would be more like the Brain Age version but with endless gameplay. The solutions to most of the puzzles so far have many numbers in sequence and there are multiple answers. The grid is very hard to read and there is no way to enter multiple choices in a box. I'll stick to my $15 touch screen stand alone game that I have. I'll sell the DS version for whatever I can get at my next yard sale.
2,"Numbers, Numbers, Numbers","Was a bit difficult to figure out at first; once you get going on the game it is hard to put down. This is different in the way you move from cell to cell, doesn't allow you to make notations, different backgrounds are nice but once I found one that makes it a bit easier to move I won't switch it now."
3,It was fine,"I have read many of the negative reviews on this, and I have to disagree about how terrible the game is. I did not buy it - I recieved it as a gift. While I do prefer the puzzles that came with the Brain Age games, this simply takes getting used to. I don't like to use pencil insertions, whether on paper or electronic, so the lack of this feature didn't bother me. Also, my version has a way to move around the squares without using the ABCD keys - there is an arrow pad in the center if you wish to use the stylus. Plus, it is easy enough to enter and erase numbers. I have played better Sudoku games, but this isn't as bad as some of the reviewers have made it."
1,Very Poor Sudoku Implementation,"The controls are poorly thought out, the fonts are difficult to read, and the puzzles don't always have unique solutions. I only paid $10 for it, and that was too much."
1,Buy any other sudoku except this one,I agree with the other reviews that this is the worst sudoku out there. It's allready all been said: the numbers are too similar to each other (especially the 3's and 8's) and being required to use the gamepad to navigate to an open square is aweful. Don't buy it.
3,"Fun, but not as challenging as expected","Sudoku-mania is an engaging game with lots of different ways to customize play. Players can select from three difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard) and two puzzle layouts (2x2 or 3x3).Players can also select from several ""themes,"" including an animae character, a space scene, lions, or dolphins. The themes allow players to switch between standard sudoku (numbers 1-9) and a series of symbols. For example, the lions theme can be played with numbers 1-9 or with mini animal icons.This game is my first experience with sudoku, and it was not as challenging as I expected. However, the selection of customization options (especially the symbols play) has kept the game fresh."
1,"If you're looking for Sudoku for DS, look elsewhere ...","I bought this game after playing the sudoku in Brain Age and I am very disappointedwith Sudoku Mania. The overall quality of the implementation is really shoddy,especially when compared to Brain Age. Just to point out a few of the majorlimitations:The user interface is really primitive. You can't use the stylus to navigate.No handwriting recognition (a nice feature of Brain Age).The font they use for the numbers is very hard to read (e.g. 3's and 8's arealmost indistinguishable).There's no way to take notes about the potential possible numbers thatare valid in a given square (this is one of the great features of theBrain Age sudoku).It appears that they generate puzzles that have multiple solutions, which,according to my understanding of sudoku, is not copacetic. What's the pointif you have to guess?Trust me, buy Brain Age, not this turkey!"
1,Just say no,"I bought hoping that the random puzzle generation would keep it interesting; unfortunately the generator, much like the rest of the program, is a disaster. For brevity's sake, rather than list out every single defect I'll just focus on the two most significant issues:1) There's no form of annotation -- no way to mark for yourself which numbers have been eliminated as possibilities. So be prepared to drag along some paper with you.2) The generator produces malformed puzzles. The whole point of sudoku is that there should be ONE solution to the puzzle, and your goal is to reason it out. The designers evidently thought differently, since the puzzle generator often creates puzzles with multiple acceptable solutions. So actually reasoning out a solution is often impossible, and you end up needing to make some random choices."
1,Not a DS Game,"The biggest limitation of this game: You HAVE to navigate the grid using the D pad, and not with the stylus. If you have played Sudoku, you know you're jumping all over the screen. Imagine having to click-click-click all the way to a open space. This feels like a quick port from another platform, rather than a DS game.Don't waste your money on this one."
1,I wish I would've read these reviews,"If you're thinking of buying this game, STOP NOW! I didn't look at any reviews until I bought, got it, played it for about 3 minutes and realized that it is, in fact, the worst game ever made. I, like a few others, bought this game because I had solved all the puzzles on Brain Age. It was nothing like Brain Age. My bad. I want my money back. Amazon should not even sell this game anymore and offer a partial refund to all that have been duped into buying it on here."
3,Not quite straight,"I bought this replacement blade for my Warner scraper. It was the only replacement I could find. Although the blade works reasonably well, I was disappointed that the three edges are not straight - they have a slight convex curve which means they will not easily scrape a narrow flat surface.John"
3,Laura,"This was the theme music from the movie Laura. I presume a reproduction, and not the original.It was OK and brought back pleasant memories."
1,Content is worthless,"... The interview is short, but beyond that the content is really not interesting if it is Dire Straits' music you are interested in. The interview does not have any cohesion, it focuses on things that are peripheral, and mostly, it does not address the music and artistry of Mark Knopfler and the group. To me, this was a complete [cheat]."
4,Best,Hey Rockers'Buy This..............Accept Kicks Ass.Get Your Balls To The Balls Man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,The Weirdest Vacation,"The book is about a 12 year old kid named Joey. Joey and his family go on a vacation near a lake. One night in his room before he went to sleep, he heard voices in his head. The voice said,""There's a door in the lake!"" It repeated in his head until the sun came up. Joey was curious about this unusual thing in the water. It was really colorful. Joey gets abducted in a blink of an eye. When he opens his eyes, he realizes that he was abducted by aliens. I'm not really a sci-fi fan but this book was ok. I learned more about aliens in this book. If you're a sci-fi fan, it's your book."
3,it was overly dramatic and depressing at points but ok,"The book was actualy pretty good if you like science fiction. I thought it got a bit depressing when his friend ditched him, and it was a little too mellowdramatic, (the reasons I took the two stars off)I like less pointless books much better, such as Dealing with Dragons or the Forgotten Realms series."
4,"Toy is fun, even for adults",This globe toy is full of informaton and can settle many arguments as well as keeping kids busy and informed. The seller was very prompt and the package was not at all damaged when it arrived. I would recommend this vendor and product highly.
2,"Good, fun educational globe","I gave the overall rating of this globe a two-star rating because it did not come with any instructions. We played all day on this globe...the whole family! But the stylus would work some times and not others. Overall it's a good, fun educational globe,"
5,Educational But Fun for whole Family,"I Bought two of these in Dec 2006 for My Nephew and Niece. They Loved this Learning Toy and Continue to use It a year later learning so Much about the world & geography having fun at the same time with its Built in Games. I Loved It so Much I Bought One for Myself this year when amazon had them for a Daily special. When friends come Over we all have a good time Playing with its games testing Our knowledge or Lack of It! Last year this item could not be found anywhere 2 weeks before Christmas and is Popular every year. This is a Welcome Gift in Most Households even one Like Ours that Owns a Wii. Batteries Last a Long time too, a Plus!"
5,Cool to an 8 year old!,"This globe was a gift to an 8 year old female who likes to learn and likes to master her abilities. She sent me a thank you note with a hand drawn picture of the globe saying that it was ""really cool."" It was a pleasure indeed to enjoy her delight."
3,"good, with notable exceptions","bought this for a college course in Mass Media. Good basics, however, it is a 2009 edition, and some of the info should have been updated - for example it lists ""hotwired"" (now WIRED) as an example of online media - but hotwired stopped publishing in 2006. Also, the index is kinda spotty, meaning that some key terms are not even listed, and others are listed as being on a certain page, but they are not. I expect a bit more rigorous fact checking and editing from a textbook. Also at least one passage so far seems to have been directly lifted from a 10 year old NYT article without attribution - naughty naughty. I tried to leave feedback on their online ""student companion"" website, but the feedback feature has been disabled. Since this is a required text, I had to buy it, but if I was teaching the course I might shop around for a better text."
2,NOT compatible with Kindle for Android,"This Kindle version is NOT compatible with ""Kindle for Android"" app. This is not written anywhere in the description as far as I can tell. This would have been a helpful bit of information for me to have BEFORE I puchased it.As fas as content is concerned (I am able to view it on ""Kindle for PC"" app) the book is a required textbook for me. I have found it to be very accessible and the layout is appealing so far. Although it would be even more ""accessible"" to me if I was actually able to view it on the device I purchased it for:("
3,Mind Numbing Detail,"There are sections of this text that read like a dictionary...paragraph after paragraph of definitions. The section on the Internet devotes several pages to the history of the medium, going back to the 1960s. My instructor told us he chose this book because it had truly current case studies (in both the book and the DVD). Yet I found these current examples were less effective than I expected...perhaps because I had already ""lived"" them?"
4,Pretty Good,"While there are a lot of old songs on these CDs, the mix is pretty good. Maybe they will grow on me. I am still waiting for Volume 1, but 2 is pretty good. I originally bought TOTPs in 1995. Now that one is very good."
1,disappointed,"Although the information given has some value, readers be aware that this is not a book. This is an information pamphlet. I was looking for a small book on the Advent Season for the children in my class to look thru, read and understand what the true meaning of Christmas is. The information in this pamphlet can be easily obtained on the internet. Needless-to-say, I am very disappointed."
3,BAKTABAK Interview review,"I purchased this cd with the impression it was going to have some great audio footage of Kate discussing her albums ""The Dreaming"" in 1982 as a promotional interview & ""Hounds of Love"" in 1985 also as a promotional interview. The interviews are great to hear Kate in her own words on her work, but hard to understand with the distracting background noises as the interview is obviously being held in a restaurant/diner. There is no music on the cd just Kate & the interviewer's voice's. It is a nice piece to own for diehard Kate Bush fan's such as myself but not for anyone unfamiliar with her work."
3,maybe the only Kate interview CD,"For die hard Kate Bush fans only, this CD brings two interviews Kate did after the release of The Dreaming, in 1982 (the first one) and also to comment the Hounds of Love album (the second one), in 1985. The first one has an abrupt cut after circa 20 min. and also lots of ""restaurant"" noise. In the second one we can hear Kate speaking clearly and the sound quality is pretty good here! Well, that's good to ""learn"" so much information about the albums anyway and the CD is also a collector item since you won't find this anywhere else! That's the only reason I recommend this interview CD."
3,Good sound,"The sound is great and the display is awesome. Usability is fine. As for the software... Unless you register with sony and have an online account with them you can only use one computer to put music on the player. So much for work (my business - my computers), my laptop and my home office computer. I am sending it back. If this does not bother you I would give it five stars."
1,Total Waste,"What a waste of money! The whole thing consists of a couple of newspaper articles scanned in with a few pictures that don't always fit on the page. None of the scanned images were formatted in any manner. Just a total waste of time and money! It should be noted in the product description that this ""book"" is simply a few scanned newspaper articles - had that information been available, I probably would not have made this purchase and experienced the disappointment that I have."
4,Not to shabby,"For the numerous years I've been reading Elfquest, Rayek has been one of my least favorite characters. But being the EQ fanatic I am I had to get it. When they first brought it out in this graphic novel version I thought that it was the same as the hardback Rogue's Challenge that was released a few years back due to the same cover. To my happiness it wasn't. It was a totally different novel and compilations of stories. By the time I finished reading this I had a totally different view on Rayek and not only LIKED his character but felt sorry for him in a lot of ways. A definate need to read if the Elfquest characters have made it into your life."
1,Just your average reader,"I just finished Dreamtime and was looking forward to continuing on with Cutter and his Tribe. Unfortunately, that was not to be. I started Rogue's Curse and cannot finish it. It feels completely out of sequence, which it is and gives away things in Reunion, which I haven't read yet.If you buy this book, read it at the end of Reunion or not at all. I'll keep my copy rather than return it just to have a complete set of books, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,Educational yet fun,"This is a book about Jake Sherman and he's shocked when he finds out that the President of the United States is coming to his class. Jake and the President switch bodies by mistake but they make a deal so that the President can do his debate and Jake can take his social studies test.I liked this book because it was very exciting. This was a great book. I thought this book was great because it told you what the President does and how hard it is. If you like books about trying to solve a problem, you will like this book."
2,Help! I'm Trapped in the President's Body,"Help! I&#65533;m Trapped in the President&#65533;s Body by Todd Strasser is just an average book. Parts of the book are funny, especially when the characters almost start a nuclear war. There is also a funny ending. I like the idea that a middle school student gets turned into the President. The book needs more action, though. All the characters do is walk around and talk. Maybe the other books in the series are better. I wouldn&#65533;t recommend this book to a friend. I rate this a 2 star novel."
3,One-way communication,"While previous reviews correctly note the value of this book in communicating with a child who does not speak English, the book has one significant limitation. To a far greater extent than in English, stress matters in Russian. The pronunciation guide does not indicate which syllable is stressed, and there is no simple rule. For a native speaker unaccustomed to dealing with foreigners, such as a child, stress on the wrong syllable can make a word unintelligible. As a result, the book is far more useful and dependable in understanding simple Russian than in speaking it."
2,Useless without stress,"As any student of Russian knows, the words are long and multi-syllabic. Stress is extremely important in Russian. Russians frequently do not understand me simply because I stress the wrong syllable. That stress is not indicated in this book is an unforgivable oversight. Who wants to look up every word in a dictionary? The other problem with this book is that there are far too many useless words. Who needs the word for a hand operated drill? These are definately not the first 1000 words you will need. Maybe 300-400 of these words are useful and should be in your initial vocabulary. The pictures are a nice learning tool although it's not always clear what the ""answer"" is from the picture. Knowing what I know now, I would not buy this book again."
2,"Great idea, frustratingly poor execution","This was a very good idea: Create a picture book of a thousand objects with their Russian names. What can go wrong?The answer lies in the nature of the language. In Russian, each polysyllabic word has stress on one syllable. If you don't stress the syllables correctly, it is very hard to be understood. Imagine learning the English word ""fundamentalism"" with the wrong stress pattern, and you can imagine the problem: at best, you sound like Borat, at worst, your listener can't understand you.And there is no reliable pattern for learning the stress of Russian syllables. You just have to memorize it on each word.As you might have guessed the Russian words in this book do not have the stress pattern marked. You just have to guess. It's so frustrating. With just a little bit more effort, this book could have been made so much more useful."
1,The Innovator's Solution,"I am afraid I cannot recommend this book. It wonders around in theory and academic analysis and never says anything practical. The imagined ""solution"" is so complex and ethereal that even the authors admit they know of no company that has successfully implemented the ""solution"". A waste of time for any real solution."
2,Christensen's Dilemma,"Funny, the author faces the same dilemma as his innovators!! Isn't it about time Christensen innovates around the next ""disruptive"" management fad?"
4,Christensen explains creative destruction and how to make it part of the firm's strategy,"The economic literature is full of articles and books on a macro view of creative destruction... ref: Schumpeter. However, at a more basic level there was very little available on how destruction works and how it can be part of a firm's strategy. Christensen has done a commendable service in educating educators and businessmen as to the forces at work."
3,A dated and verbose read,This book was a difficult read for me. It uses a fair amount of business jargon and lots of (somewhat dated) research but doesn't quite get there with advice. One takeaway for me was the importance of addressing non-consumption (e.g. Apple introducing products people didn't know they needed). The authors also discussed the difficulty of disrupting existing markets although Walmart and Kmart show what is possible. Overall a dated and verbose read.
1,Miss-printed book,"The service was fast. The book was in good physical condition. The only (and somewhat major) issue was the book was miss-printed. Pages 86-116 were missing from the book. Where these pages were supposed to be were pages from other chapters. I don't know if the seller knew of this or not, but it somewhat defeats the purpose of purchasing a book if all the pages aren't there."
5,outstanding review of challenges and guidelines for action,"Christensen updates challenges presented in the Innovator's Dilemna and focuses on guidelines for meeting those challenges. The text is great, the footnoting is amazing."
4,Almost completely compatible...,"This remote works very well, but I only have two gripes...1. The real Apple Remote sends a return instead of a space for the play button, and so applications that expect that, like EyeTV's full screen menu mode, do not work. However, it does mean that it can pause iTunes and other apps directly without having to use Front Row at all.2. The signal could be a little more powerful, I think. The angle where you hold it does actually matter at times."
4,good but not really necessary,It works great...but its not really something you need if you already have the apple remote.
5,It works! (if you set things up right),"So, after messing with this for a long while in Leopard - I figured it out. The 'menu' button replicates pressing command-escape, so that shortcut needs to bring up front row. By default, that shortcut isn't enabled.. So go enable it! That makes everything work, which is super."
1,Waste of money,"The range on this product is no where near what was advertised. I purchased (2) units and neither will work consistently beyond 4-5 feet from mac. Attempted to improve operation by relocating mac, using USB extension cable, and changing ID on transmitter with no improvement. Extremely disappointed."
2,My mistake on this one,"I usually buy high end bags--Michael Kors is a favorate--so I was very disappointed in this one. I needed an olive green bag and from the picture and description it looked very nice. It was pleather--which I knew--not leather, but the quality was very poor. I have seen excellent quality pleather bags, of course, and they actually looked and felt like genuine leather. This one did not. It is now a storage bag in my office closet and works well for that. I don't blame Gal-Mart; their service was excellent. For that they got 5 stars. I chose not to send it back and pay shipping charges when I could use it for something else."
2,"Decent Performances, flawed packaging...","These are good performances of each of these great ballets. The performances could, however, be a bit more vibrant.What really ruins this box set is the packaging. EMI bureaucrats decided that rather than running Sleeping Beauty over to a third disc (disc five, by the way, which plays for forty minutes) that they would cut two movements from this great ballet. Presumably these bureaucrats would also cut Joyce's Ulysses in order to bring the book in at the primo manuscript page length in order to keep costs down. Personally, I prefer to hear what the composer wrote in full, rather than what some bureaucrat or some conductor thinks is preferable cost wise or aesthetically.Once again, boos and hisses to EMI who continually are doing such things (see my review of their Lehar, Merry Widow reissue)."
3,Wonderful Performances Marred by Heathens,"This collection of the complete ballets is absolutely spectacular. The orchestration, the tempo, the conducting, and the overall quality of music are absolutely immaculate, and have provided me with many hours of delightful entertainment. I particularly love the performance of Swan Lake and the Nutcracker on here. With the Nutcraker, the music really does paint pictures in your heads, of fairies and dancers and sugar plums and flowers etc. etc., and the Pervin's rendition here really does help with that. Wonderul music.As another reviwer commented, chopping up music for the sake of marketing one less CD is an absolute disgrace. The 3 stars is not for the quality of music (which deserves 5 stars), but rather for a uncultured uncivilized marketers who have commited an absolute travesty by cutting off sections from Swan Lake for the sake of CD space. Regardless, this set is well worth listening to as what is actually on the CD makes it worth the price."
3,"Nicely played, but too comfortable by half","This is fine as a bargain, but there's a lot more that can be done with these works. In all his Tchaikovsky ballet performances Previn sounds correct and sensible, but in that virtue he misses a lot more. There isn't a grain of passion or fire in this performance and not much buoyancy or fun, either. I guess you could call this a very English approach to the music, and UK critics seem to like Previn a great deal in Tchaikovsky. I think you need to go Russian, or Ansermet, or Monteux, and luxuriate in either of Karajan's recordings (on DG and Decca) for the three suites."
4,Good Stuff,I received this book in top condition. It was delivered very quickly as well. From what I read so far I am enjoying the book.
4,Memories,"Having been stationed (USAF) at NKP 68-69, it brought back fond memories for my brothers in arms. Well written and descriptive accounts."
1,A Total WASTE Of Money!,"I wouldn't buy this book if I were you. It's really a total waste of money. This book is only a making of two writers desperate to earn money. This book if full of Diana bashing and worse of all, they are not true. The book only contains allegations and provide no solid proof to prove that these things actually happened. The authors really didn't think before they publish this book. The Princess is already dead, and cannot defend herself anymore. And they used this to write an utterly distasteful book about her! How immature of them! And what a friend is Simone, if she's really a friend of Diana, then she wouldn't write this kind of book about her! Bottomline is, DON'T BUY IT!!!"
2,Already a credibilty issue,"I have not even read the book yet, and I find a huge mistake. The picture in the book that is labeled Hasnat Khan is actually Dodi Fayed. If you look at pictures of Khan and there are several online, you can see that he has fuller lips and straight thick hair. When you compare the picture in the book to pictures of Dodi you can see it is the same person.If they can't even get that right or missed the correct name in the editing, you begin to wonder about the rest of the book."
2,Self-serving biography,"Author Simone Simmons purports to be one of Princess Diana's closest friends, a ""healer"" and confidante who was constantly giving advice and comfort to the princess. However, she admits that she was not invited to Diana's funeral, and that at the end of her life, Diana was not speaking to her. Most of this book is a rehash of information which has been published in other sources and the quotes from Diana could be deduced to be her attitude in certain situations. As another viewer stated, she claims to be a big supporter of the princess, but she is also very critical of her. She devotes one chapter to her own trip abroad which she took to protest land mines and she says that she persuaded Diana to take this on as cause. This book seems to be self-serving and a pure profit-making project for Miss Simmons, as I don't see that the proceeds were given to one of Diana's many charities."
3,Interesting content but lousy writing,"I don't mind at all that this book is tabloid-ish; Simmons gives names and details of events that other Diana biographers have merely danced around. And besides, Simmons knew Diana well by all accounts. But the writing absolutely reeks and is poorly edited. Marginal grammar and wretched sentence structure abound, paragraphs end with a points that are never explained, and value judgments are dropped throughout what otherwise appear to be factual narrations. The author makes little distinction between what she knows and what she suspects. Also, there are tangential explanations of things that have little to do with Diana, like the author's ""healing"" career. If you can bear the writing and skip over the diversions, there is interesting info inside. Is it true? Anyone's guess."
2,"Save your money, and just read the tabloids","I haven't read too many biographies on Diana (I am just starting) but I found this book provided very little information I had not already known. I felt Simone Simmons was too self promoting in this book and seemed to try too hard to throw in the ""she only told me"" phrases. She also seemed especially competetive with Burrell's biography adding lines to explain why Paul Burrell wouldn't have known something. The photographs provided in the book were curiously all from previously published sources. Where is the personal connection she is claiming to have shared so strongly? It appears to me, Simone Simmons was just one of Diana's hired help and not the ""best friend"" she claims to be."
2,The author didn't even know Prince William's zodiac sign!,The minute I saw that error..I stopped reading the book! Prince William is a Cancer..NOT Gemini!! This author was no friend of the late princess..IF what the author has revealed..(if true) the princess would not have wanted it published! Trash this book!
1,Give it a Miss.,"The saddest thing about this book is that I have come to understand that Diana had no friends. This witchy wannabe cashes in on her ""friendship."" One friend- one true friend in this young woman's life coulds have made a difference. She was walled-in and an a victim of the leeches that surrounded her. This book goes in the trash heap. I don't believe a word one."
3,Interesting memoir,"Diana, Princess of Wales, met Simone Simmons during a visit to an alternative medicine clinic where Simmons worked as a healer. The two women became close friends. This memoir tells the story of their friendship, from its start through the day when Simmons learned of Diana's death.Simmons has strong opinions, particularly about the other people in her friend's life, and she does not hesitate to share them with her readers. This book is definitely a memoir, not a biography, and as such it makes enjoyable reading for Diana's fans. I found its viewpoint an interesting contrast to those of other authors.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of ""Love, Jimmy: A Maine Veteran's Longest Battle"""
3,not for cheddar,"This is the coarse microplane which should do well with softer cheese like cheddar, but it's not coarse enough for that. I like it only for harder cheeses like Parmesan. I recommend getting a regular shredder for cheddar, or better yet, an attachment for kitchen aid or Cuisinart."
4,This is a really nice razor. It's aesthetically ...,"This is a really nice razor. It's aesthetically pleasing, has nice, solid weight to it, and comes with a convenient storage case that also holds replacement blades. The blades were easy to change, and it was definitely a comfortable shave -- there was no dragging or pulling. My only complaint was that with a brand new blade I suffered a bit of razor burn, but that could just be my sensitive skin. Overall, I'm happy with this razor, will continue to use it, and would recommend it over disposables."
2,Didn't like it,"It seemed that Kennedy has great techniques on the violin but he has no ""musicality"". He was trying to do too much and was getting too flashy with most of the pieces here. There is a way to play popular music and another way to play classical music, you just can't mix them up."
1,CLAIM,"SOORY BUT WE DIDN'T RECEIVE THE PRODUCT YET, DESPITE WE PURCHASED ON NOV/10/2006.WATH'S HAPPENED ?"
5,Very good collection and Kennedy's performance is great,"Simply,I like to listen to great music in this CD. I'm interested in classical music and I knew already some of the titles in this CD before buying it. I should confess that while I was buying this CD , It's for the titles whose names I have never heard. I wanted to hear new and good sound. Because I trust Kennedy's pleasure ,and I thought these couldn't be bad,and I was not wrong. Even if you know some famous titles ""Presto from summer -vivaldi"" or ""Air on string the G string- Bach"" or ""Hungarian Dance -No5 Brahms) , listen to them again with Kennedy's interesting and outstanding performance. You won't regret it."
5,Clearly Kennedy,"I had only heard Kennedy one other time and knew that this would be good, as it is. I'm not new to classical music and can say that Kennedy's playing is clear and beautiful. I don't know why others have such a hard time with it, but if it's talented and artistic violin music that you're looking for then this is for you..."
4,Classic Kennedy,Classic Kennedy is a 1999 EMI Classics recording starring Nigel Kennedy and the English Chamber Orchestra. The sound quality is a bit supbar which is a shame. Julian Haylock has written the music notes. Also included are notes by Kennedy himself. The booklet also contains photographs from the time of the recording. Recommended. 4/5.
2,Private Benjamin goes to prison,"I've read a few of the author's books and found them, for the most part, to be witty - but this one isn't one of her best. It's a tired, rehashed, unoriginal story that runs out of steam pretty fast.A beach book, nothing more. Save your money for the paperback, or better yet, take it out of the library for free."
3,Good mindless reading,"I bought this book at Wal-Mart just because it looked good. I have to say it was so-so. I did like it all in all, but I for one did not like how the book switched from one point-of-view to another. It really was kind of confusing. I wish the book would have been only from Jennifer's perspective. I couldn't imagine being thrown in prison, and I wanted to know how she coped. The book is very improbable though. I really don't think that a person who was terrified of going to prison would actually be stupid enough to believe they could hide a cell phone in their bra, or who would tie a belt around their prison uniform and think it would be fine!All in all, it's a good silly read, and I loved how she got back at her boyfriend, but I was hoping for a little more true-to-life situation."
3,Definite improvement on her last novel,"I toyed with the idea of reading this book or not. Her last one (Bad Boy) was so terrible, it almost put me off her novels for good. This book was definitely deeper than her usual novel, but her formula with revenge is getting kind of tired. Although the story had a good premise, the picture of life on the inside was unrealistic (which she somewhat noted at the end of the book). It's hard to beleve in this day and age that a woman as supposedly smart as Jennifer is would take the fall for her boss. I also found it hard to believe that the inmates were able to smuggle laptops and cell phones into their cells (but you never know). The ending of the book was so neat and tidy and also improbable. But...Otherwise it was an interesting book. It took me a while to get into it, but when I did, I couldn't put it down. She is a very good writer, I just think she can do better then she has lately."
4,"Much better than ""Bad Boy""!","""Bad Boy"" had been really disappointing. This one - of course it is again a revenge story - is again readable. The author seems to have done a lot of research about female prisoners and their lives."
1,An Original Novel?,"Jennings Correctional Facility seems to be the women's alternative to Shawshank. This work was a disappointment. Our heroine, Jennifer Spencer does intake,laundry duty, library duty, even spends time in the hold and her friend, Movita has the warden's ear just as the her male counterpart in The Shawshank Redemption. There is no originality in this novel. The rest of the plot is another First Wive's Club clone..."
2,women prisoners ARE suckered by men,"I liked this story very much. I just gave it 2 stars as I was comparing it to deep literature, but it was really fun to read. I do have some contacts with prisoners, and I found the author's descriptions carried a flavor of authenticity. As a woman, it was fun to watch these women find themselves and their power, and use it for positive reasons. It was nice to see them engage in a generative struggle- more win win than lots of stories. The undercurrent of love and support among the women was very refreshing."
4,"This book ""locked"" me in!","I bought this book thinking that it would be a lot of laughs, it wasn't. It was however, a good story. It was a bit far fetched at times, but I found myself rooting for Jenny and her friends.Each chapter in the book being told from a different character's view point added to the flow of the story. A good beach read."
4,It's not what it seems.,"Other reviews give the plot, etc. I agree that some of the writing is mediocre and that some of the plot is unbelievable, but what Goldsmith has done here is exposed the inhumane situation in America's prison systems, especially women's prisons. She cleverly concealed it in a bestseller style and gives good entertainment while doing so.Therefore, I gave it 4 stars and urge people to read and learn and realize that the truth about our country is not found in the newspapers. It is odd how much of the truth is buried in popular fiction and Goldsmith is to be commended for her research, her daring and her entertaining style."
4,Really fun read,"I LOVE the banter between the hero and heroine. I just wanted them to talk to each other all night (of course the other stuff they did was great, too). Ms. Leigh has such a great ear for dialog and making her characters real and appealing. Great read."
4,"Strategy in Poker, Business and War - John McDonald",This is a small and concise introduction to the issue of strategy. Easily read in a weekend or less with great value. This is a keeper for sure.
5,96 toyota Right side door handle,Great product and fast transactions.Just what i was looking for and the part fit just perfectly
1,Need a gym,"If you don't have access to a gym, don't get this book. I thought I could use this book for home workouts, but I was wrong. I don't understand why they write books for people to use at the gym, when you can get plenty of advice at the gym and all of the instructions on how to use the equipement is on the machines. If you want an at home workout, don't get this book."
3,Good if you are a Gym Person,"For under 50 pages, this book is good for the beginner who is going to join a gym or is going to start using the membership she has been paying for.It is straight forward and simple. A good tool to have if you are looking to focus on improving your rear end, especially if you are just starting out."
2,Good advice. But...,"The main reason this only gets 2 stars is that it's poor value for money - less than 50 pages!However what there is is very good, & the layout & pictures are excellent."
5,BUNS OF STEEL,"THE EXERCISES IN THIS BOOK ARE GREAT. MY BUTT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR ME. THESE EXERCISES ALONG WITH LOTS OF CARDIO HAVE HELPED ME TO FIRM UP MY BUTT. NOT TO MENTION, I CAN'T SIT DOWN. SO, IF YOU WANT BUNS OF STEEL THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU."
1,Not as Advertised,"It may not make a difference to most people, but I was looking to match some Realtree AP clothing. This tape is Realtree APG. There is a difference."
1,Does Not Stick to Anything,"Look elswhere. Wanted to use it on some geo-caches and it barely sticks to dry plastic. Plus, there is really not very much tape - at the price a total ripoff. DONT BUY!"
1,Allen Company Cloth Camo Tape,I received the tape and when I applied it it did not stick very well. The ahesive appeared to be lacking sticking quality
3,Nothing special!,Whatever. It's camo tape. If that's what you were looking for. Here you go. I have nothing bad to say about it other than it may be slightly over priced.
4,Camo tape,"I am enjoying photographing birds in the fields, so this camp tape is good for the equipmets hide, tripods, big lens.only I dissapoint is that I ,living in Japan, can not buy the goods directly through Amazon,so that I asked my friednd who goes USA to take delivery in his hotel ."
1,Look closely,"It escaped my notice that the '1' means ""Kindle [version] 1"" as opposed to ""[qty] 1 replacement cable"". For inexplicable reasons, Amazon chose a different connector for power port between the version 1 and version 2 of the Kindle. So when I went to plug the cord into my version 2 Kindle, it didn't fit."
3,Different cables for my Kindle.,"This didn't work on my Kindle, gave it to a friend and it worked great on his. I would think all Kindles would use the same chargers."
1,USB end is not correct connector,"I ordered this replacement cable because my first one got garbled up by the vacuum cleaner. Unfortunately, the replacement cable for the 1st generation Kindle does not have the correct USB connector to fit my Kindle. I plan on returning it and trying to go to some stores that carry Kindles so that I can match up the USB end with my Kindle and make sure it fits. What a drag!! Are there really two types of 1st generation Kindle USB cables?"
2,disintegrating cable for kindle,Length:: 0:32 MinsI pulled out my cable to charge my kindle and to my shock the whole thing had disintegrated and I had exposed wires! I googled this issue and found out it was quite common. It was suggested to call the kindle cs and they gave me an instant credit to purchase a new cord while on the phone with me.
1,It did not fit.,I purchased a replacement cable since my original cable's insulation was peeling off. The replacement cable did not fit my Kindle. The connector was too large.I returned it to Amazon with an explanation....and have never heard anything since.
5,Love at first sight.,So far it has been to Spain and Norway and I never want to be without it. It is all that I hoped for and I only use it for books. Someday I may go further but just wanted to get new books cheaper and instantly without leaving home. It works for me. Try the Kindle! I bought an extra cable to make sure I did not lose one and not be able to recharge it. It is also dual voltage which was important to me.
4,Cable Deterioration,"The plastic coating on the calble has hardened and is peeling off. I don't know if others have had this problem or not. It is not due to dryness as I live in Hawaii and that is not a problem. I would buy another one but am afraid it would just be the same. I have only had this one year, should last longer than this. I hope that Amazon will take action to correct, but don't think they read these comments. Many have commented on the poor quality of the small portable light (M-Edge e-Luminator2 Booklight for Amazon Kindle (Fits 6"" Display, 2nd gen), but nothing has been done.Len Hammondlen.hammond@live.com"
3,I wish this charged!,"I love my kindle! I read it constantly BUT today i broke my adapter...it's really to weak. Anywho, i've been trying to find a way to charge it while i await the arrival of my replacement adapter. My iPhone can charge through a USB port with my computer and through it's adapter..I wish my kindle could too. :("
1,Waste of money,USB plug was to big. Went to radio shack to get the proper size. Would suggest starting there if you need a new cord.
5,Does the Job.,I bought an extra cable for my Kindle so I can keep it at the office for moving content. I love the white color. Amazon learned something nice from Apple. I love that the Kindle and all the accessories are white. Clean & modern. Very chic ! Does the job. Reasonable price too.
5,Just What I Wanted!,"This item was just what I wanted, and it had a great price. It works just as I hoped for, and it's a great addition to me Kindle experience."
2,everybody correct re insulation on earlier Kindle,My Kindle adaptor insulation just simply disintegrated too! Looks like it has been chewed up. Why does this happen? Hope this one is better.
3,Please include electrical pug,I need the electrical plug in adapter. I've purchased 2 without it and with out a computer handy it is worthless
3,Wrong Cable for Kindle DX,"Like everyone else, I ordered this when my original cable disintegrated. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with the first generation Kindle DX."
1,not what i need,HAD A MSG FROM AMAZON THAT THIS WAS FOR MY KINDLE I DONT HAVE THE ON ROUND ENTRY TO KIND HAVE BOUGHT TWO OF THE OTHER AND THEY DONT FIT. AM NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT I HAVE BEEN RECEIVING.KORKY
4,Close to perfect C++ learner's guide,"With this book I learnt C++ from scratch. Even now when I can handle C++ quite well and used it to earn a living, I am still using the way the author presented the material in this book to think when I write OO programs. I said it's a ""close to perfect"" book is, in fact, to express a kinda regret that I need to find some other materials on C++ to tell me more about multiple inheritance. If not taking this into account, I would rate this a 5-star book. From scratch, it shows and walks with you the way from how to write procedural functions, arrays, pointers to classes, from simple private inheritance to polymorphism and from objects to containers. Simply, it's really a great book for beginners."
3,Small with lots of typos,"Even with the tremendous number of mistakes and typos, this is still a nice compact review book to read while you're on the subway or don't feel like lugging a >800 page C++ primer around. You still need to have a good C++ reference and tutorial book, though."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Simply not enough info in to few pages. This was not a ""traditional"" Schaum's Outline that I have come to know and depend upon.Spend a few dollars more and get a more comprehensive Schaum's on the same subject. If you're uncertain of how to do that, simply review the indexes of a few books; The more comprehensive the index the more comprehensive the author treats the subject.This was a waste of my money!"
4,its a good book. But u need programming with C also.,"The book is good but it doesnt cover struct's and unions. unions are worth there weight in gold in data i/o programming. The book has not got a mistake on it as the ""Shaun G Pearson of nova scotia put it"". Its using the newer C++ library and <iostream> is part of it. (...) I suppose the book doesn't want to go to far into C stuff. C is essential to writing clear and concise code in C++. But at the price the book is at its a good buy. I've got it."
2,"Covers basic C++, far out of date.","This book will give you a basic grasp of C++ at a good price. Unfortunately, the information in the book is dated and does not follow current C++ standards."
4,"Cable didn't work, but...","I bought this cable to hook up a new laptop to my home network for some file transfers. Fresh out of the packaging, the cable did not work. Tried to hook it up elsewhere to test it and its just dead. At first I gave the company and the product a 1-star rating, but they very quickly contacted me to apologize and offered a fix. I didn't think it was worth the hassle of returning the cable since postage would be more than what the product itself costs. But I am changing my review because they at least cared enough to contact me to try to resolve the problem. Since they were willing to do that then I would do business with them again."
5,Product Received and Functions as expected,"It's hard to provide a colorful review of a product like a USB cable but.. what I can say is that the ordering process was simple, easy and effective. The product was received in the expected time frame and I am pleased."
2,The humor is sparse and dated,"Written in 1954, this book depicts football before it became the national passion that it is now. At that time, professional football was a minor sport with a following that was limited compared to the college game and dwarfed by baseball. The jokes here are certainly clean, after all this is a book by Scholastic Book Services, but the modern child will be a bit taken aback by the depth of cleanliness in the stories.The jokes themselves are not terribly funny; to understand many of them you have to know some of the history of the game. For example, you need to know about Jim Thorpe to understand the significance of a joke about what he said in a game. This book will not make you laugh out loud, for most readers the most significant outcome will be a wry grin."
2,Not What It Seems,"This book is a great book on classic cars....unless you are actually interested in American classic cars. The book review never mentions that 80% of the material is on the foreign exotic car market. On top of that, the book deceives you by showing 5 out of the six cars on the cover as American. There is only one section that covers all Ford cars from 1920-1936. For anyone who knows Fords, a lot went on during this time. However, in a span of about 10 years, there are 15 entries for Ferrari. On top of this, this book considers cars like the Ford Taurus and the Chevy Cavalier as classics!!!??? If you are looking at this book to show you a little bit about classic cars, I would say do not waste your time or money. There are many more books out there that will do a better job with more familiar cars."
3,Not what I expected,"This publication was a bit more historical then I wanted but it is quite information and has some interesting antecdotal information. Those who have not ever been to Boston may not find this to be worth their while but those who have dealt with the heartaches of Back Bay traffic will understand,"
1,Born To Make Me Happy (If she stops singing),"STOP! (And I'm not copying her stupid ""remix"") BTW, how does one word constitute a remix?"
5,Just like when I was little!,Quality and fun! I love having magic tea with my daughter with the same set I had as a child. It's really neat. And Playskool never disappoints!
5,Must have for all Princess Tea Parties,Mom loved it and the Girls went crazy when the tea/water turned purple. Durable and Cleans great. My daughter liked the color and print better then ones she saw online.She stills plays with this and her friends alway ask to use this when come over ages are from 4 to 8.
3,Tea party review,"I bought this for my 3 yr old granddaughter whom loves having tea parties. I chose this particular set because of the cups turning colors, well this feature does not work. Waste of money."
5,This Is The One,"Whomever is looking for a Tea-Set 'ready for liquid', this is the one! After searching through many toddler-type Tea-Sets this is the best find, IMHO. Complaints for other sets are; rusting, hole in cups to keep user from drowning, liquid poured from teapot does not dispense properly, etc. The reason for less than 5 durability rating is because it is plastic and can easily melt or crack if stepped on or dropped on hard surface (i.e. one has a balcony and little ones drop things onto concrete below). Thus, this comment is here because of ding-bats 'out there' thinking a TOY like this should withstand titanium type durability tests... sigh..."
5,WE really enjoy it!,We are sooo happy with all these videos. We love watching them over and over again. It really helped our library grow. Our friends like to borrow them from us. Thanks for making this possible.
1,SPO/t SpotBrites Safe-T-Strobe Pet Light,"I purchase three lights. One did not light new from package, One worked for about one minute and then would not come back on. I did not bother opening the third light. These are junk and do not recommend anyone to purchase."
5,i love tis game!,"you see i dont have the game yet, but i have played the demo. this game sort of reminds me of cops and robbers. you got to get the loot without being seen or else you fail."
3,biased,"This book presents American foreign policy in a very negative light. Blum is a fierce critic of U.S. interventions and sometimes his ideology hurts the credibility of his book. The fact that the book ignores the millions who died under Mao Zedong while covering America's policy towards China over the years is inexcusable. Blum also fails to mention the human rights abuses by Fidel Castro's regime. That being said, the book does offer countless examples of why American policies our criticized by people residing in other countries. American policy in Southeast Asia, Central and South America has been particularly appalling over the years. In conclusion, if you choose to buy this book, purchase it knowing the information in it is presented from an extreme leftist perspective."
1,Worthless Left-Wing Propaganda,I'm sorry to say that I actually spent money on this! I had thought of returning it but I didn't want to allow these misconstrued fantasies to be further spread so I destroyed it. It's sad that the author used biased references and half truths to support his position. As a retired USAF military member I'm ashamed to think that I protected his rights for over twenty years. If he's so against the U.S why doesn't he leave this country and go peddle his stories somewhere else.
4,Important Read,"I admit that I am a bit of a conspiracy theorist, but you need not be one in order to be shocked at some of the information contained within. The reason is that many of the sources referenced are mainstream media. Not that this makes the information true necessarily, but it certainly provides a dose of credibility to other more abstruse historical accounts."
5,perfect book for topic,"I had to buy this book for one of my International Relations classes, and any fellow student knows there are basically no textbooks worth getting excited over. This, however, is an exception. It's not your typical drag-on, historical fact after historical fact textbook. This is a very conversational, plainly written, semi-sarcastic compialation of US foreign policy interventions. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,"Fits the bill, but keep your options open","This particular variant of Arizona Ice Tea leaves little to the imagination. Straightforward taste and moderate zest leave you with a slight satisfaction.One thing I found disappointing about this beverage is that the label was confusing. I really couldn't find any of the information I was looking for on the label. This concerned me and I'm still worried about it as I write this review.If I had to sum it all up, I would say that if I never had this tea again, my life would not change in the slightest."
4,Seed cups,The cups are excellent. The only things I do not like about them are that they have a sticker on the inside that is very hard to remove and where you screw them on to the cage is painted so it makes it more difficult.
2,disapointing,"I have enjoyed Linda Brava's earlier recordings. However,I found her newest endeavor very disapointing. Her natural creativity and talent was lost as she was trying to prove herself to be an accomplished violinist to her many critics. If you want to hear linda at her best, select an earlier recording like, Aquamarine. I wish she would continue to listen to her own muse and only do independent songs.It is quite evident that her heart, soul, and talent is missing from this recording."
1,"Horrible, horrible disc",I've heard high school violinists with a better tone and more musical instinct.
1,Really really really not good,"Or in other words, really really bad. Occasionally Linda Brava's performance rises to the level of being only moderately bad, but mostly it is really bad.Her intonation is suspect much of the time, and her bowing technique is deficient, resulting in an often scraping, uneven tone. At times, it even sounds as though her bow is skittering across the strings, which amazes me. That is elementary technique. With universally cautious tempi, it sounds almost as though she is afraid of the music, and it appears as if she did the one necessary take on each piece, called it good, and scurried out of the studio to attend to her other myriad business interests.Clearly, these short & relatively undaunting pieces are beyond her limited technical capacities. There are no greater heights awaiting her in the world of classical music. Perhaps a crossover album or two might prolong this undeserving career."
5,Great book for understanding relationships,"Recommended by a friend, this is a Biblically based short book, but I read a little and stop to reflect and ruminate. This book is good for an adult who finds that the childhood family is dysfunctional. It helped me to understand a cause and effect relationship. I learned why my adult siblings froze me out when I had cared for our dying little sister."
1,does not work,"These cartridges do not work in the Epson 2200. It looks for its own Epson brand, and refuses to work with anything else."
1,Don't buy this,"I have an epson 2200, in an attempt to save some money i bought these. installed a couple of the cartridges, and they don't work. After trying to clean my print heads and doing all the maintenance i could think of , they still don't work. A waist of money. Just buy the epson's I guess."
2,Apologetic in the wrong sense,"This book seems to be a rehash of ""The Cruelty of Heresy"" by C. Fitzsimmons Allison, but aimed at a less educated audience.In this book the author spends most of his time explaining to the reader, in the most patronizing way imaginable, why theological orthodoxy is important. Those who are not convinced will quickly understand that the book is not for them. Those who are convinced will soon want to yell, ""enough already! I'm convinced! Get on with it!""I'm certainly generalizing from my own experience here (I fall into the second camp). I recommend Allison's book, and not this one."
1,Unless it's filled with dollar bills....,...then anything over 13 or 14 bucks is extremely expensive for this model of baseball--Rawlings brand notwithstanding. One wonders how they manage to sell any at all at this rate when less-expensive prices are easily obtainable. Great baseball--no question there--but a lousy deal.--JR
2,Not the best but close to the worst,Shipping was ok. The baseball isnt pearl white when you get it and it doesnt feel like the real ones. do not buy if you want it to be pearl white
2,Not as shown,The picture shows a ball in a clear plastic cube. The baseball came in a cardboard box (no cube) and it had scuff marks on the leather (as if it had been previously used). Now I am going to have Fukudome sign this baseball with scuff marks on it and I won't even have a clear case to store it in afterwards. Not cool!
2,A fantastic start a unrealized finish,I loved the first section. The words flowed and entranced me with the vision of time and it's real meaning. I developed a new appreciation for the meaning of time and how I view it. I was expecting a total development of that beginning thought. What followed was just dull and never really opened up any new directions or motivated a new outlook.
1,never again,That was the worst book I have ever read. The constant music puns and repetition of every single point was almost as bad as his incessant need to quote everyone who mentioned anything related to sound in the nineteenth century in America. I felt like he beat me over the head with his main point for TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY-NINE PAGES! It was terrible. I had to stop reading it. Do not buy this book unless you really feel compelled to experience bad writing.
2,Too many other authors.,"I love elfquest, but this is one of the worst books in the readers collections. There are a collection of stories that don't fit anywhere else, and all but one shoudln't have been published at all. The store of Egg's meeting with Timmain is wonderful, good art, good story. It is the only one worth while. The others have poor art and chatoic story lines. The store where sutter was a cross breed between elf and human, rather than a wolf rider wear bearable to read, but not really enjoyable. The other stories I couldn't get through. Don't wast your money. Find a back issue with the the storry about Egg."
3,"Cute, but...","This one is cute, but not as cute as it looks, and also, not as secure. It's fading very quickly, so as long as you're ok with knowing you'll probably want to replace it shortly with another or one with higher quality, then why not get it? It is sweet, after all."
1,"It has been replicated at MIT, in a series of beer bottles","Science and Torah confirm each other truly. As both Bertrand Russell and the old melamdim, including this Nissim Rov, inform us, the World before the World was created, well, it was a Different World. Causality and the other Laws of Physics just didn't work the way they do now. Then G-d, Boruch Hu, thought, lehavdil, how to get some regularity and entertainment into this Dead Machine? So he caused, lehavdil, the Big Bang. Since then we have had the Lights, and Shells, that scholars and mitzvahniks see, and the Moon, Sun, Oceans, Rivers, Mountains, Trees, Pretty Girls, Snowfalls etc etc etc that the rest of us see. All Khlipah, but I will stick with these Manifestations, rather than bury my face in more Books."
2,not well organized,"maybe this book will work for someone, but not for me. I had hoped for a clear explanation of how to read and chinese cursive, but good just mysterious poorly explained charts."
2,same old warmed-up movies,"they keep redoing the same old little rascals movies then they add one new movie to the collection----then sell it as a new collection! i've had it!! & i'm not going to take it anymore! SMILE!! i'm not buying little rascals collections anymore!!I have 3 different sets with some of the same movies on all of them!! they put them in color to get you to buy them-- first you have the B/W. then when you buy the color it is the same thing all over again, i.e. 3 of the same then one new one!! that's it until they add ALL new movies & IN COLOR!"
4,Become a dominating runner,This book is a must read for those who believe in true strength training. The training technique that is talked about in this book is something that can be used at any level. A definite must read.
4,I haven't read it yet,"I've read it briefly a couple of pages and the book seems amazing! At least, as any other running book! I would recommand it to a friend!"
1,waste of money,"Complete waste of money. Mispelled words, lack of information regarding actual running, and too many pages about relationships with coaches! The author talks about various sports other than running. If I had wanted to read about other sports, I wouldn't have purchased a book called ""Running to the top""!!!"
5,Good quality,The seat post is of very good quality. We received it in just a few days. It was a perfect fit for my daughter's bike.
4,Great Gift,I gave this to my 10 year old nephew for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! He liked all the activities in it. The only negative is that the lock on the box sticks and is almost impossible to open even with the key.
5,"Our own ""Boy King"" loved it!","Learning should be fun, and this splendid kit from Running Press Kids is truly a blast. I purchased this for an eight-year-old who had begun to demonstrate an interest in studying Egyptian history. I can guarantee that this gift was a total WOW for him. He didn't just read about art, science, religion, and daily activities -- he was able to actually hold in his hands ""artifacts"" that stimulated his interest to an even higher degree.This is a great value, and his parents enjoyed playing with it almost as much as he did!"
5,Hugh Fordin,"One of the best books I've read, details the amazing career of Arthur Freed and provides insight into the magic of the art of making musical movies."
1,"Great price, lousy service.",I've had the stock G2 battery since we bought it and have put many cycles on it. It's still going strong.I've put about 10 cycles on this thing and it won't even hold a charge overnight anymore.Spend the money and get the Canon real thing. Or buy 25 of these things.
1,Digipower BP-CN511 corrupts my photos,"I have had a problem with my Canon Digital Rebel that I tracked down to the Digipower BP-CN511 battery (7.4v 1300mAh). The battery fits well, holds it charge, but when I take photos it often corrupts the image stored on the flash card. Really weird, but verifable. When I use the original Canon battery no problems. Seems funny the camera powers up fine, but when it goest to store the image the data it is getting corrupted.I had an incident where the Canon Digital Rebel blew a fuse and I had to pay $200 to have it fixed (symptoms was the battery part got really hot, and the camera acted completely dead).I picked my battery up at Best Buy, which seems to no longer carry the item. I'd strongly recommend AGAINST buying this non-OEM battery for your Canon.Looked at Digipower's 1 year warranty and you need original proof of purchase and $5 to get a replacement. Given my $200 repair and lost photos I'm not going to risk it again with them."
1,Classic Bait & Switch,"I Bought the item expecting it to be the same one as in the picture, and therefore the same one as came in the camera new.Redtag town instead sent me a knock off battery. I definitely felt deceived. Classic bait & switch. I am going to return it as I have read too much about cheap knock off that don't hold a charge."
1,DigiPower knock-off,"Advertised as a DigiPower battery, it isn't. I didn't even try it. Sent it back and got a refund."
1,Worthless,Bought this as a replacement battery. Does not retain its charge after a day or two. Also lasts for only 30-40 pictures compared to the original from which I was able to take more than 100 pictures. So this does not even work as a replacement or emergency battery
1,What a disappointment.,"Note to self: Next time read the product description more thoroughly. This isn't Roxon's original, delightful 1969 tome. Rather, Ed Naha took her format and typeface and completely rewrote the text, without any of the original's charm and wit. This one's going to Half Price Books soonest. Feh."
3,Lillian Roxon's Rock Encyclopedia (revised 1978 edition),"With Lillian Roxon's passing in 1973, the task of updating her Encyclopedia fell to one Ed Naha. To make room for all the new big-selling acts of the '70s, a great number of the artists covered in Roxon's 1969 original were purged from this edition. Nonetheless, this was a good place for info on ELP, King Crimson, and Jethro Tull. It's amusing to see America's first glimpses of Punk: In 550 pages, there are only the briefest mentions of Patti Smith, The Sex Pistols and The Stranglers alongside Fleetwood Mac and Linda Ronstadt."
2,Weight misrepresented,"The weight as shown in the Amazon product details is very wrong, it states item weight is 2 lb (32 ozs), it is in fact 12.5 oz, you will receive less than half (almost a 1/3rd) of the amount in weight of chocolate, which I am sure will be delicious come Christmas Day. Makes it a VERY EXPENSIVE $17.89 for 12.5 oz including packaging. Will not be caught out again."
1,Does not fit 2010 4Runner,"Even though it says that this product fits a 2010 $Runner Limited, there is no way to make it fit without serious modifications to the vehicle. Do not buy it if you have a 2010 4Runner."
1,Fraud?,"I'll get right to the point. I don't think Turow wrote this book. I was an avid fan from his fist book onward, eagerly waiting new releases, buying hard cover and paying hard cover prices. His style was unmatched. Reversible Errors is at best a clumsy effort. Some passages make no sense whatsoever. Perhaps Turrow has taken to drugs or lost his mind in some fashion. Or, he's desparate enough for money to put his name on the works of others. How could something like this happen? If I weren't such a long time fan I'd say nothing. Frankly, I'd like to hear his explanation."
4,Adventure in Egyptian Tomb,"This is a very interesting and fun read. If you are at all interested in archeology and Egyptian tombs, this is a must. Like Crichton's later books this appears to be very well researched. Even if you're not into archeology (I'm not) it is still interesting and suspenseful throughout, and the ending is very funny. Crichton shows that even at a young age he was a talented writer. I found this book (The Last Tomb aka ""Easy Go"") to be much better written and more enjoyable than his other John Lange books,""Zero Cool,"" ""Grave Descend,"" and ""Binary."""
4,"a.k.a. ""Easy Go"" by Michael Crichton - Excellent!","I can't believe nobody has reviewed this book yet - I just finished it and it was a great read! This book was published when Crichton (writing as John Lange) was only 26 years old. Considering his age, and the fact that it was published in 1968, this was an outstanding book!The plot involves the discovery of an intact Egyptian tomb, and the efforts of an eclectic group of individuals to rob it.The book obviously lacks the sophistication of Crichton's later novels, but if your tastes are simple, it's a fun read with a rather unexpected, though brief, ending.Definitely recommended for any Crichton fan, as is Binary and other books written by ""John Lange."""
5,Do The Potty Dance,"These are far better than the Pampers Easy Ups because of the velcro like sides that make them easy to remove. I have also found that the Huggies Pull Ups are easier for my son to remove when he goes. The television commercials help too, because it got my son interested in leaving the diapers behind! Buying these at Amazon.com made things even easier because they were delivered to my door and saved me a trip to the store"
3,Like the designs...to bad they leak!,"We had been using these but they are a little stiff..not soft at all and they leaked EVERY night! We love the designs but had to switch could not stand having to strip bed every day to wash bedding! FYI we are now using pampers brand....they are soft, flexible AND so far no problems with leaking! :o)"
2,"May work for some, but...","My son was completely freaked out by these the first time he wore them and won't wear them again! The feature where it gets cold when they pee in them sounded brilliant to me, but the first time he wore them and that happened, he freaked out. Ha ha ha. He kept asking ""what happen to my pants?"" I tried to explain that when he pees in them, they get cold, and if he wants them to not get cold he can do that by using his potty. He's not interested. Too bad, they have the characters from Cars on them...one of his favorites...so I thought he'd LOVE them."
2,Shipped Product Changes,"The first order of pull-ups I received was branded with Toy Story characters. I was quite happy the design of pull-ups had changed since I last purchased them. However, all subsequent orders of pull-ups I received were branded with Cars characters. These were the old, poorly designed pull-ups. The design of the Toy Story pull-up is significantly improved. There are tabs that mimic diaper tabs as well as the 'velcro' sides on the Toy Story pull-ups that make for easy folding to dispose of the pull-up. The velcro sides were much better and the pull-up itself seems to stay on the child's waist better instead of gradually getting lower as the day progresses. If Amazon would consistently send the new, improved Toy Story Pull-Ups, the review would outstanding."
4,Not great for overnight use.....,My son was 3 when we bought these and we only needed them for overnight use. Normally I love Huggies pull ups and they are great for day time users. My son is a heavy wetter at night and he would frequently leak out of these. I know they make special night time ones and I suggest those for night time use! Otherwise love Huggies Pull ups!! Never had a problem w/day time leaks when my son used them.
2,Cars characters not Toy Story characters,"Very disappointed purchased because of the Toy Story characters they said were on the pull-ups. Instead it was the characters for Cars. My grandson is into everything from Toy Story. his bedroom is decorated with the toy story theme he has all the Toy Story movies, toys, books, bedding etc. So needless to say I thought this would be a great way to introduce him to potty training. He has the movie Cars and shows no interest in the movie(so no help here). I feel that this is false advertising and you should receive what the say they are selling.Huggies Pull-Ups Training Pants with Learning Designs, Boys, 3T-4T, 52-Count"
5,Good deal,"This is a great product if you are like me and your child is being stubborn about doing umber 2 on the potty. For 20 bucks and free two-day shipping, you save on gas as well."
3,No choice as to design,"We just ordered these for our two and a half year old. As a potty training incentive, he picked them himself -Toy Story. Imagine our surprise when a pack of Cars Pull-Ups arrived at our house. Listen, the pull-ups still work and functionally are no different than the Toy Story ones we ordered. But as any parent of a two and a half year old knows, there is a big difference between Toy Story pull-ups and Cars pull-ups, especially when you picked out and are expecting Toy Story pull-ups."
1,False Advertising,"I bought these because my son is obsessed with Toy Story and this package claimed they were.Unfortunately, the package came with Cars on the front and Cars diapers inside. I was more thanangry, I know its crazy to buy diapers based on the photo but we were having success with potty training.This was my most regretful purchase on Amazon to date!"
2,Underjams are better.,So we switched from pull-ups to underjams. Much higher liquid retention capacity. Otherwise very similar. Both are crazy expensive. These are better though. Am I up to 20 words yet?
4,Don't leak and my son loves she cars on them!,"Great pull ups, be sure to get night time ones for night time...because they will not hold a nights worth of pee!"
4,Convenient,"Convenient, absorbent diaper for overnight. Didn't help my kids with potty training much because they are so good that the kids don't feel the wetness enough, even with the wetness liner ones."
4,A Little on the Large Side,"These are great if for no other reason than the graphics. My son loves the movie and is happy to put them on and show off his 'Big Boys' and the cars on each one. Also, they're good at holding in leaks and loads, which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 3.As compared to similar items, the Velcro sides are nice but they can be a pain if your child figures out how to open them. The other brand has sides that rip easily along the seams if you need to use them as a diaper but don't allow little fingers to open them too early.Also, my son is 40 pounds and these are a little bit big on him. The age is about right on these but they better fit kids who are 38 to 45 lbs."
5,Easy on and off; good absorption,"I like these very well. They are not bulky and can be taken on and off, open and reseal. The absorption is quite good as far as training pants go. But traditonal or overnight diapers would still be needed at night and for naps. I started my son with these during the day several weeks ago. They appear to be comfortable and my son likes the Toy Story characters.Just one thing. I wish all of them are Woody and Buzz. My son refuse to wear those with Just Buzz and no Woody. I now have a pile of Buzz only diapers sitting in the cabinet."
2,Quality is not good as Outside Buy,"I have found, the quality of the diapers is not good as i buy the same product outside stores like, Babies r us, Costco.These diapers are so delicate not enough stuff inside.The only good thing is less expensive than other stores."
4,Nice product.,"My kid has grown old 2 years now the usual diapers are difficult to put it on him.The Pullups are good quality but it seems to be bit rougher than the one I purchased from the local store, same size and same brand.Anyway, My kid likes it and that is important.I hope that before the pull ups are over, my son is fully potty trained."
3,"Not a ""Toy Story""!!!","Ordered this package only because of ""Toy Story"" on it, but received the one with ""Cars"" instead. From our experience, the ones with the ""Cars"" a leaking, so I had to return it. Amazon just added the description of ""new"" pull ups with the right package picture (Cars), but main picture still has missleading Toy Story. Make sure you are OK with ""Cars"" before ordering!***** (for Toy Story)+ * (for Cars) = ***"
5,Huggies Pull-Ups,"Great product. Re-sealable tabs a plus, unlike Pampers Easy Ups. Best price on Amazon! Huggies has great customer service and sent coupons when I recently called to comment on how much the pull-ups are helping my son with potty training."
1,The Unconcealer,This product did nothing to cover my dark circles. It goes on very thinly and then disappears. It was not even effective as a base.
5,tales of the wish fairies,this book tales of the wish fairies( by the author laureen jones)is one of the best books i have read in a while.suitable for the young at heart as well as children.full of adventure and enchantment.good versus evil and some lovely poetry as well.excellent choice for all who love fairies and fantasy.
1,Received the wrong item,"I was excited to receive this as I thought my daughter would enjoy it. However, what I received was in fact a hardcover book and not nesting blocks at all."
1,Please read and consider this before you buy this book.,"HiI am a 21 year old senor at Bible College, I am married and my wife and I are trying to start a family. When we decided to start a family I felt it would be a good idea to get some Godly, Biblical guidence in parenting. So Looked online for Biblical parenting Books with good reviews. This book had Great reviews and from the sounds of the reviews you would think that this would be a top notch Parenting book filled with Godly, Biblical advice. Well, it is full of advice but not biblical advice. was not able to finish the book due to the Heresy in it. I personaly will not be giving my copy away, I will most likely end up using it as an example of twisted and misinterpreted scripture or destroy it and let it find a home in the grey filing cabnet.Justin"
4,Restoring the Christian Family,The book was in good condition with a few marker markings and the book was bent upon shipping.
4,For Parents Too!,"I am the parent of two adult children of divorce. For thirteen years since our family divorce, I have been seeking closure to this very painful experience. My concerns have been mainly for my adult children, because I think in they are the ones who have been hurt the most. My ex-husband and I seemed to move more easily into our new lives. This book is a MUST for divorced parents like me who want to understand their adult children better. I'm sure that other parents will find themselves and their ex-spouses in these pages as well as their children. After reading this book, I sent copies to my daughter, son, and ex-husband. It has opened new and productive dialogue in our family. With thirteen years behind us, we can all put the situation into better perspective and move ahead in our various lives."
4,This shaving cream was very good. It had ...,"This shaving cream was very good. It had a nice feel to it. Initially, I didn't think it felt creamy enough -- it just seemed a little too airy at first. After using it for a few days, my impression improved. I think it has a good scent. I'd use this product again."
3,"I wouldn't buy this shaving cream again, but ...","I wouldn't buy this shaving cream again, but I wouldn't recommend against it either. There were things I liked and disliked about it. I didn't particularly like the smell, nor the fact that the can didn't fit easily into my shower caddy. My normal brand of shaving cream has a much smaller can. I also didn't like that it was a foam. I've always preferred a gel because it takes just a little bit of gel to make a whole lot of lather. With the foam, it was harder to spread and it took more shaving cream to get the job done. The one thing I DID like about this shaving cream is that it lived up to its name; I have very sensitive skin and the Barbasol did an excellent job."
4,This product worked fine for me. I'm used ...,"This product worked fine for me. I'm used to shaving creams that are """"thicker"""" for holding up while shaving. However, I got a good shave with it. The fragrance in the product was neutral, which I liked. I'd recommend this product if you want a good shaving cream and don't want to spend a lot of money."
4,"When checking prices, I found that this product ...","When checking prices, I found that this product was very reasonable. The product performed well and was put to the test on my husband. He's a surveyor and works outside, so the weather can be quite harsh on his skin. Barbasol for Sensitive Skin worked very well."
2,Vague in it's approach.,"I much preferred ""The Healing Art of Sports Massage""--it's author has impressive experience that was every day for 20+ years...the illustrations and text/knowledge are clearer and easier to apply."
2,vague.amen,this was used as a text in my school five years ago. better texts available now. mr.king probably has a much better book in him
3,Anna's back...,"I recently listened to an unabridged version of this book on CD. There was surprisingly little time spent on actual personal happenings between Anna, the king and the court. She really does get into the history, culture, art, customs etc. of Siam in the 1860s. Three quarters of the book is taken up with this very kind of detailed and endless information. Nadia May, with incrediable skill and a voice that is as prim and English as Anna's, adds to the diminsion of this narrative. Her amazing ability at pronounciation helps capture a real sense of time and place. If one is looking for the glamous story from broadway or the movies--be ready for a disappointment. For a person fascinated by the culture and history of this country as well as interested in the English view, then, get your walking shoes on and have a nice listen to Anna's story."
3,decent...,"Although easy to read, and good for those who have seen the movies and not read the book, I would not really recommend this to anyone who has read the books and is looking to expand on their knowledge of Tolkien's world. There are a few mistakes and often times (to my horror) characters are compared to Harry Potter characters. If you want a good bed time read this book is probably for you. But if you are serious about getting to know Tolkien, try something else first."
4,A mythological study of Tolkien for juvenile readers,"Better than Leslie Ellen Jones's ""Myth & Middle-earth"": by not pretending to give anything more than simple, basic explanations of the most obvious mythic parallels, and delivering them in language not overly cutesy, Colbert succeeds at his modest task surprisingly well."
3,Again with the vikings...,"I learned some very interesting tidbits from this very quick read. But my brain kept screaming ""Why is he writing like this?!?!"" I felt like it was a book aimed at older children. After endearing this for far too many pages, I looked at the About-The-Author and saw that he wrote for the Eyewitness Books, a series of educational (but beautifully done) picture books for older children. It all made sense. So...if you have a couple or so hours to spare, read away. I actually learned some neat things about LOTR."
5,As Expected,I was not too sure about the end connections. This item comes with plastic adopters that would fit both type of end connections. I am delighted with the performance of the roller.
4,Rename relaunched,"Junior Cartier, formerly John Carter of the big beat elite 'Monkey Mafia' and hardline DJ of the now departed and sorely missed 'Heavenly Social'club has refound himself as a cool dance genius. Swapping dubbed out trip hop for soaring synthesiser riffs this single and the mix album 7 Live are truly masterworks. BUY THIS NOW DAMMIT."
1,don't waste your money,"This is a very bad cd. No music. Verbal interterview, seems distorted, hard to understand, of only Mick Fleetwood speaking to some DJ. It is only about 15 minutes long."
3,Meah,These shaving creams are ok. I expected more creamy coverage but some of the cans spewed out liquidy cream. Not too great.
4,Welp- it's shaving cream!,"It is what it is- no major comments. The only thing I could mention is that it's very watery & runny the first couple times I use it... probably the first 1/4 at least, before it gets foamy. Whatever."
1,design of cap no good,LEAVES RUST SPOTS ALLOVER.CAN NOT PUT UPSIDE DOWN IN THE BATHTUB BECAUSE OF DEFECTIVE CAP.CAP MUST BE MODIFIED BEFORE I BUY THE PRODUCT AGAIN.PRODUCT GOOD.CAP DESIGN SUCKS.!!!!
2,"Subtitled ""Hire Gallup""","We use Gallup at my workplace. Gallup is an excellent organization and we're better for working with them. However, this was too much. It's not a book. It's a brochure. Their Engagement Index is brilliant, but you can skim the other 260 pages without missing anything important."
1,Wrong can,"While I was delighted to find this out of stock item on the site, I was disappointed that the vendor sent us the wrong can of regular cream. It gets a bit irritating when you expect better service."
2,Lost Horizon Shangri-la info at wikipedia,"Later releasesIn 1942, the film was re-released as Lost Horizon of Shangri-La. A lengthy drunken speech delivered by Robert Conway, in which he cynically mocked war and diplomacy, was deleted because it was feared such sentiments expressed at the height of World War II would prove to be unpopular with audiences. Capra felt the film made no sense without the scene,[1] and in later years film critic Leslie Halliwell described the missing twelve minutes as ""vital.""[5]read it at [...].You will see that scene in the original restoredLost Horizonmovie."
3,lost horizon shangila,This is not the correct tile for this movie. The tile for this movie is Lost Horizon. I bought this movie because it said Shangrila. There is a second book written by the same author called Shangrila this is the movie I thought I was buying.
4,Beautiful but with scatches,The pendant arrived way before the delivery period so that was a pleasant surprise considering I am in the Southeast Asia region. It is a beautiful pendant but it had scratches on the silver surface area surrounding the pearl. It's obvious unless you look at it from a reasonable distance. For that reason it could be priced a little cheaper. Was going to give it to my boss for her b'day but quite embarrassing with the scratches :(
3,Count satoris and grains of rice...,"...if you must, Hakuin, but you just couldn't sink your teeth into Bankei. Note: don't vote for me, I'm not running."
1,Not worth the few dollars I spent on it,This thermometer has never been accurate and consistently shows temperatures under the normal 98.6 degrees. I dont trust it especially after having a really bad fever where I was sweating bullets and it showed I was at 98.2 degrees. I dug out my old glass one and it recorded me at 101.7...big discrepancy there. I would only recommend spending more money and getting a one second ear one instead.
5,"This is a quick, easy, and safe way ...","This is a quick, easy, and safe way to check temps especially on children. You don't have to worry about glass breaking and you can feel confident that the reading will be accurate."
2,I didn't particularly like the thermometer. It was ...,"I didn't particularly like the thermometer. It was nice but the flexibility was a pain. My child couldn't easily hold it in his mouth. I think that if you were to take it rectally, it might not be so bad, but mine are the age to take it in their mouths. So, for an infant it would be great."
4,Artistic clock,I was looking for a wall clock that can also serve as a wall decoration. This clock apparently worked for this purpose. Friends came to visit were all impressed by it. I gave it a 4-star because it was a bit pricy.
5,nice and inexpensive,I bought this for my aunt's birthday and it was really pretty. Great quality for the price.
4,Solid Doc on Richard The Lionheart!,Enjoyed watching this documentary. Helped me to understand the story of Richard the Lionheart. Some good detailed information about the events and places. Although the pacing could be a bit faster I enjoyed this program and will show it to my family.
4,Fantastic soy pasta,I've never encountered soy angel hair before. It cooks extremely fast and is very tasty.
5,This is great!,"This is great food. If you are trying to get and stay on a vegetarian died, this is it. It is now the bottom staple of my diet now. It has little or no starch with a great source of protein. You may want to go to a store to try a small amount at first to see you like the taste. Personally I loved the way it tasted, but to each is own. Bottom line... I recommend it highly...... Vern"
5,My husband and I both loved this product. ...,"My husband and I both loved this product. We normally shave with soap and water, but this was great! My legs felt really smooth afterwards. My husband didn't seem to have as many nicks, either. A little goes a long way, so it will last longer. It has a pleasant smell, too. We'll definitely be adding this to our shopping list and recommend it to family and friends!"
1,Stay well away from this product,Wish I had read these reviews before making the mistake of installing Norton 2006. My once zippy laptop is now slowed to a crawl. Literally takes minutes for internet pages to download.
1,Pitiful support (and product),"Go back froze at boot. E'D Norton a question and got a long answer not at all related to the question. Still frozen on the go back screen. Goodby Norton, Hello one care."
1,Norton Personal Firewall 2006,Purchased the 2006 firewall.Product installed easilyProduct will only recognize Norton Anti-Virus.If you wish to use another brand this will cause an error to be registered on your firewall. Called their help line. they first told me to remove my anti-virus because it was a combo package.It is not a combo. Second call they told me in very poor english that they only recognize their own product for and anti-virus. Be carefull with this product. It can be a big waste of time and money.
1,Norton Internet Security STINKS,After deleting half of the programs on my computer including all Norton Products due to recommendation of incompatibilty from Norton website (!?!) I still can't enter the product key.I WILL NEVER BUY NORTON AGAIN!!!!!!!
3,Helpful for competing !,"I agree with the other review on this board: this DVD is very helpful in terms of posing, diet, what to expect when competing... however there are 2 Figure Coaches who make it uncomfortable to watch! You can feel that they are nervous being filmed, and I had to fast forward a few times because I couldn't take it anymore.Aside from that, I was VERY impressed with the overall content (aside from the bad editing). I think one of my favorite parts was when they compared ""good posing"" to ""bad posing"". What a difference! Then they showed live footage and you can see how amazing the correct pose looks next to some of the girls who can't pose at all! So I really liked that part.I am making it a goal of mine to compete in the future, and this DVD did give me a lot of helpful tips."
1,better choices out there,"Very poorly made, the price is OUTRAGEOUS. It's NPC specific but doesn't list it as such. The film quality is awful. Don't waste your money."
1,The Figure Competition Training Guide,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. The packaging was cheap. It looked like a home filmed movie with bad editing. A very poorly directed,written and edited instruction video. It definitely wasn't worth the money. Cathy Savagage has a far better DVD for a fraction of the cost."
1,Does nothing,"I needed to get away from parabens and aluminum and was dissatisfied with plain baking soda (no way to keep it there), and so I bought 4 different natural deodorants at once. Glad I did. The Kiss My face goes on easiest as a stick. But it does nothing. I am stinking in a matter of a few hours. I found the crystal sticks work better and the roll ons of mineral origin. I am very odiferous and this is very important to me."
3,B.O,"This deodorant i like that its all natural, plus it doesn't irritate my skin. However it doesn't do its job with lasting long at all. I think it lasts prob 30 min and thats it. I'm on the search for a better all natural deodrant that actually works."
1,Not my favorite product.,"The Thrustmaster Ferrari GT 2-in-1 Rumble Force Racing Wheel gave us one week of racing before falling apart. Fifty dollars is a lot to spend for one week's enjoyment. The quality is poor and the plastic snaps easily. If you are looking for a racing wheel, it would behoove anyone to shop around for something else. It might not be as inexpensive, but it probably won't be as cheap, either."
1,Buttons faulty -6 months use,"My version of this self-destructed within 6 months. the shift paddles broke off almost immediately, the other 16 buttons started dropping out immediately after and continuned until the thing was unusable. It'd crap...Don't buy it, unless you enjoy donating. I have to use 20 words to submit this review, It isn't even worth the effort. Don't buy this POS"
3,Not bad...but,"Pretty decent wheel for the money and I agree it works great with Test Drive Unlimited. The feel and handling is the best for this particular game (in my opinion). My reason for the three stars is the problem I encountered about four months after I purchased it. I'm not rough on gaming units as they tend to be expensive to replace, however, this wheel did stop responding. The wheel would recognize left turns but for some reason ceased responding to right turns. Everything was still fine. All the buttons worked and the pedals functioned, but it became useless for anything other than NASCAR racing! (and not totally good for that either)."
3,For Ford requires a bit of Drilling,"I ended up having to get these professionally installed because of the Drilling required. If you plan to install yourself and don't want to mess with drilling make sure you contact Westin. The finished product is nice, but I wasted a lot of time before realizing the bracket would not match up to the Factory pre-drilled holes. The guy who installed said he sees this all the time on Fords. Installation was about $70 in Richmond Va if you are factoring in this cost to your purchase."
5,SUPER SITH FUN,"I GOT THIS TOY ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO AND IT IS AWSOME!!! MY BROTHER HAS LUKE AND OBI WAN KENOBI(EPISODE2)AND WE BATTLE ALL THE TIME!!IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE ACTUAL DARTH VADER. IF THIS TOY IS NOT AVAILIBLE IN TOYSRUS I'D TRY [a local store]. YOU CAN COLLECT ALL THE SITH LORDS AND THE EMPEROR(IF HE COMES OUT). RIGHT NOW IM GOING CRAZY SEARCHING FOR ANIKIN, MAUL, AND DECOO. YOU CAN ALSO CREATE SCENES FROM THE MOVIE WITH DARTH VADER, ANIKIN, YODA, LUKE, MACE, OBI WAN, AND OTHERS.IF YOU GET THIS TOY I HOPE YOU HAVE LOTS OF FUN WITH IT!!!"
4,Bun' Story - Remarkable,"Having seen the movie, The Killing Fields, I found this autobiography to be enlightening and exciting. To read about how one individual could survive the horror and have the strength later to rescue others, then be united with his family was cause for hope for others. To find that this young man lives in Ellensburg, WA, near my hometown, was amazing. The human spirit is resilient!"
5,EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!,"What a great book! The author Elizabeth Minchilli has done has superb job in creating this wonderful book. Although she's not Italian, she now lives in Italy after marrying an Italian architect. Her love and passion for Italy is obvious and the wealth of information that she has gathered is priceless to anyone thinking or planning to buy and/or restore a home in Italy. Her informative writing is beautifully coupled with fantastic photos from the well known photographer Simon McBride. The setting of some of these homes is spectacular! There are many books out there on Italy, but this is truly a must for any fan of Italy or old rural architecture. I highly recommend this book even if you don't have any intention in restoring a home in Italy."
3,Beautiful Images,"A book that is in a large format which makes the photos seem like you are almost really there, but the book isn't so heavy that it is cumbersome. The variety of homes and gardens are good enough to make almost each one memorable. One of a group of recent books on Tuscany and Italy that will become rare and more expensive to purchase as time goes by. I think most people will find it worth the current price."
4,Restoring a Home in San Diego,"After our house burned in San Diego county, during the waiting time for the insurance company, the architect, the engineer, and the city approval, we purchansed MANY books on Tuscan design and architecture, as that is the style we want to emulate. Restoring a Home in Italy provided may examples that helped us though the selection process."
2,General Dog Knowledge,I was hoping for a book that had more information about the breeds temperament and specific information on the breed. This book was more of a general dog maintenance book and most information anyone who owns a dog should already know. I did enjoy reading about the history of the dog but still all the information you can get online....
3,Giant Schnauzers by Barbara Andrews,This book is base on the America Stantards for Giant Schnauzers and because I am in Australia a lot of the stantards are different but there is still some good information in this book.
2,not as good as vhs version,"This low budget South Korean-made dvd spoils Gance's masterpiece with its poor picture quality and shabby video transfer. No wonder it's so cheap. Furthermore, the first few minutes of Carmine Coppola's music soundtrack is cutoff from the DVD."
3,Beautiful when it worked,"I bought this TV around 2007.Maybe the life expectancy is only 5 years, but I was extremely disappointed that the motherboard went out after 5 years. And maybe I'm used to the old, name brand TVs that lasted for 15 years, but I'm still disappointed.When it was working, it had a beautiful picture. I had a home that had the insert in the wall for a TV. The sound system was so good on this TV that I had to turn the stereo sound off, otherwise it would boom against the walls of the home. (I'd turn it on for football, but otherwise, I didn't want the base bouncing off the walls).I give it a firm 3 stars for picture and sound, but it lost a firm 2 stars for the short time it 'lived'. Yes, the motherboards can be repaired, but because it weighs so much, I'm not going to invest in the transport requirement to get it fixed."
3,worked the same as regular dipes!,"my son is inthe middle of the weight range, he's about 17 and a half pounds, and he out-peed this diaper in his night time sleep of 8 or 9 hours. i don't want to wake him to change his diapers, but his clothes and bedding are constantly soaked!i wish these had worked, I was hopeful."
4,Hard to find,Finally was able to get size 3. Stores on;y seem to carry 4 nad 5's. Great until he grows a bit bigger.
2,Do not expect to receive these in a timely manner.,"These diapers work fairly well for overnight usage, probably a small bit better than regular diapers. A size 3 overnight seems smaller than a regular diaper size 3 though.HOWEVER, shipping is very tardy for these diapers. Despite expected 1-2 weeks for shipping, my order from over 3 weeks ago still hasn't even shipped. My new estimate is now over a month away with expedited shipping. Shipping for this product is simply unreliable, unless you plan at least a full diaper size ahead of your baby's growth. I'm cancelling."
2,"Used to be great, but they've changed....","and now are thinner and do me no more good than the regular diapers from Costco. The previous style were much thicker and more absorbent but my last two shipments have had a different, thinner diaper. Beware!"
5,stop wet cribs with this purchase!,These diapers are the ONLY diapers I have found that keep my girls beds dry at night! They are also great for traveling long diastances in the car. I have never had one leak. Amazing product and highly recommend for babies that sleep long hours at night. My daughter sleep over 12 hours at night - NO LEAKS!!!!
1,Too small and leak,"I bought these diapers after friends said they worked for their children. My child however they did not work for. They say 16-28 pounds and my child is 20 pounds and the diaper seemed to be too small for him, and he woke up wet. He wears pampers during the day so I will try pampers baby dry. These diapers just did not work for us, I suggest pampers baby dry you can buy from the store and not have to pay for shipping."
2,Beware the Kindle edition - poor conversion,"The kindle edition of this book is in the older Topaz format. As with other books in this older format that I have purchased, paging on my Kindle 2 is slower and sluggish compared to newer books.Fonts are sometimes odd - paragraphs will suddenly appear in a bolder font than their surroundings for no apparent reason. Lines of text will sometimes be set unevenly vertically as if the second half of the line were a superscript for the first half.Most importantly, however, is that I went to one of the sections where I was already familiar with the mathematics involved. Over the course of about 12 pages, I found two sections where, partway through a mathematical expression, there would suddenly be a large chunk of text missing, as much as half a page dropped out. I verified this on both my standalone Kindle 2 and the Kindle for PC software."
4,Practical & Sound Advice,"The authors have packed a lot of info into this slim book. Their four-part strategy: 1. Lift weights to lose weight; 2. Cut back on the (simple) carbohydrates; 3. Exchange fiber for fat; and 4. Extended fat burning from cardio training. I've read extensively on fitness and diet topics and I couldn't find any bad advice in the book. Just ignore the 40 photos of pumped-up steroid freaks and women with breast implants. If the authors had found some normal models I would have given the book five stars. For the price of (roughly) of two body-building magazines, this book is worth the price."
1,This is the WORST book I have ever paid money for!,"Don't waste your time on this one. This ""book"", and that's a stretch, has only 48 pages and 46 of them are dominated by photos of ego-maniac body builders in their most ""cut"" poses. The text font is large and the word content is small, like trying to stretch a 5 page term paper to 10 pages! Most people will never, ever, EVER come close to looking anything like these photos.I bought this book because I was interested in books similar to Atkins style, low-carb diet and fitness. This title was ""highly recommended"" by someone. THIS BOOK IS USELESS! It's non-specific about anything. The two page appendix is the only useful information. The rest could have been written by a fifth-grader.I wasted my money...you don't have to.-GL"
2,Not worth the Money,"If you've little or no experience photographing anything this book might be helpful. Other than that I'd recommend you look elsewhere.Much of this information is easily found on the internet in 5 minutes of searching. If you'd like to learn more about dog behavior to help photograph dogs I'd recommend a dedicated book on dogs.My copy was published in 2003. It has 4 pages, total, of information on digital imaging. Admittedly digital camera technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the 5 years since; to put it bluntly this book is sorely outdated.The photography and poses are bland. A tip about creating an uncluttered background is ironic as the author provides scores of pictures with distracting background elements. Another tip about moving the flash off camera seems not to have been headed by the author either.Spend you're money elsewhere. Even at $16 and change this books going to goodwill on my next run."
2,Not-So-Creative Canine Photography,"If you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer, this book will provide lots of information. It also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog. But for my taste, I found the photographic results to be uninspiring - too much posing, too much portraiture lighting, not enough of just plain capturing that wonderful dog as it is."
5,"Poignant thriller, with more depth than Ullyses!","Wow! What else can I say? The main character, Chuck Simon, is like a post-modern Holden Caufield, except he has telepathic powers and an ass-kickin', talking dog named Rommel. Not since H. Sommerset Maughm's 'The Razor's Edge' have I read a story as poignant... David Peters, It definitely begins with him!!!"
5,As exciting as evr,"This was the first ""grown-up"" film I saw, when it was first released, back in 1951. It was on TV the other night and I found it as exciting as ever, full of psychological mystery and exhilarating chases against some beautiful scenery. Trevor Howard would be a match for Daniel Craig anytime and Jean Simmons is lovely as the vulnerable trapped ""butterfly"" of the title. I highly recommend it to anyone who liked ""The 39 Steps"" or ""North by Northwest"""
2,Routine 'thriller!',"I guess in the fifties this must have been exciting but in that respect it doesn't stand the test of time. I found it mildly interesting as I might find a museum piece or a bit of social history: Britain in the age when rationing was still in force. And of course, it's always of interest to see stalwarts of the British post war movie industry doing their thing but there are so much better films to watch than this. It represents something of a decline for Howard when set against masterpieces like Carol Reed's The Third man or David Lean's Brief Encounter and neither does it stand comparison with Hitchcock's early British thrillers with which it's been bracketed.As a nostalgia piece it's okay but great cinema it aint!"
3,IT WORTHS,"The after war life in England and the special views of Liverpool then are very interesting. The Overhead Liverpool Railway, which was demolished in 1957 is shown in this DVD."
4,Third Book in Legal Briefs Series,"Going to Far by Tori Carrington is the final book of the Legal Briefs Series. This is fun afternoon read about a Sicilian family (The Bertelli's) facing mob charges and being represented by Ian Kilburn ,Marie Bertelli first love/lust. Check out the entire series A STRANGER'S TOUCH (1), FIRE AND ICE (2), GOING TOO FAR (3)."
4,Very Good,"The only thing I wish this headset did better was provide louder volume. Usually, it is not a problem at all, but when I am driving, I always have to put the windows up to hear it properly. No big thing - under normal conditions, it's almost perfect. I love it."
3,Terrific but broken,I can't say enough good about the HS810 headset. I use it with my Motorola V600. Great sound quality. However - like Todd from Houston - after 3 months the plastic hinge where the boom mike flips out broke off. I have one small piece holding it together and when that goes I'm sure mine will stop working as well. Sloppy design for such an awesome product.
2,try a better solution for your bluetooth headset needs,"I have had this headset for several months now, and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK, but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect, ie. no background or wind noise, and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off, when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset, I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws."
1,"Great Headset, terrible reliability.","Everything is great about this headset except how long it lasts. I purchased my first HS 810 in September 2004. The plastic hinges broke after a few months but did not affect performance. However after around 6 months the microphone stopped working; I could hear others but they couldn't hear me.I sent in the headset under warranty and it was replaced by Motorola. With the second headset the plastic hinges broke again and now, just recently, the microphone stopped working! Additionally, the rubber around the earpiece used as a cushion between your ear and the headset will come lose and/or melt if you leave it in a hot environment (this happened to both earpieces).I loved everything else about the earpiece, now if only I could get it to last..."
1,Very unhappy 0 for 2 and no customer service on the weekend,"We ordered the motorola hs810 headset and the charger was defective. We actually ordered two products from Tiger Direct and both products were defective. We now need to wait for Tiger to contact us, and wait for them to fix the problem with both products. Oh yes, what was wrong with the other headset we ordered? It was used... yes, somebody elses ear was wearing it and it wasn't a clean ear either... needless to say I can not recommend this company."
3,"Great functionality, poor construction","This headset functions great. Decent reception, cool form factor...the problem is the contruction. After about a week of owning it, the plastic piece that covers the ear started to tear away (looks like the glue came loose). The next problem I had was a piece of plastic broke off of the hinge. Finally, I notice that the case sometimes comes loose and must be snapped back together. I typically carry this in my pocket, so no major abuse on my part. I will say - with all these problems, it has not affected the performance of the device at all. Everything continues to work properly. But for a $50-60 earpiece, I'd expect better construction."
3,Requires an old charging connection,Just be aware that it is not a micro connection only a mini.The earpiece is a bit too long for the unfolding boom.
2,It's the people I talk to do that do the complaining...,"I bought this the other day and charged and linked it up. Whenever I use it I can hear the person I talk to very well (with volume all the way up), but all I hear is complaints that I sound horrible. I get comments like I sound like I am in an empty room or underwater. So on my end it sounds great but I guess not so great for the people I talk to.They notice that it sounds better when I turn the volume down...but then I can barely hear them. I even got yelled at when I washed my hands...they though I was blowing into the speaker! I don't recommend this product even though the idea of having a light thing attched to your ear without wires is great.Also...the earpiece should be bendable to fit the ear better. I feel it wobble around when I move my head."
2,Works OK- but fragile,"I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn't really as ""standard"" as one might hope!) However, it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch. Did not impact usability so I didn't care. For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems). The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase, so I don't know why it is proving as fragile as it has. If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed, it is a good choice. Otherwise, I suggest looking at other designs."
2,Battery life too short,"After one year using the HS810, the internal battery dies and you can not buy a replacement.The ear protection rubber falls off completely. Requires a quiet environment for good transmission."
4,Ok headset,This works pretty well most of the time. My only complaint is that it does not secure to the ear very well. Other users have complained that the volume is not that loud. I have not experienced this...I drive a loud Jeep Cherokee and I have used it while on the highway and have still been able to hear the conversation.
1,Beware this is garbage,I bought this with my phone from AT&T when it first came out. I took very good care of it but with everyday usage when opening and closing it causes the unit to break due to its housing being plastic. Make sure you thought of this before buying it. I would rather buy the HS805 because it last longer and uses AAA battery.
1,lousy product,The Mororola HS810 Bluetooth headset is a piece of garbage! It worked for about a week and then died.
2,"Works well, but poorly made","It works great, but the plastic is flimsy. In about 8 months the first one had cracked in several places. After receiving a replacement from Motorola (since it was still under warranty), the new one lasted just a few weeks before plastic started chipping off (on the hinge where the boom flips out). It's great as far as technology and functionality, but it's really poorly made. I'm not even going to both trying to get another one from Motorola. It's not worth the trouble for such a poorly made device."
2,Poor Sound Quality,I was able to get better incoming and outgoing sound quality with a $24 Jabra Wave Boom.
4,"Works great, but could be sturdier","Love the ease of use and design of the headset, can hear other end very clearly, and they can hear my voice clearly as well. Very wind-resistant. Unit is constructed of plastic that cracks fairly easily, and rubber surround has all but come off of mine, but even with these problems, the unit continues to function well."
2,Dont use the belt clip,"When I did have this headset, the sound quality on my end was good, battery life was excellent, as was the range. The other person always said there was an echo when I was talking to them. The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all. It was always a task to get it around my ear quickly, and even then it did not feel secure, although it never did fall off. My biggest problem with it was the belt clip, since it came off when I was walking and I lost the headset. I have had cell phone belt clips and pager clips which have never come off, I feel as if it was a design flaw or perchance a fluke. Overall, I didn't like the feel of this headset."
3,nice...but flimsy earpiece,"I have had this product for a month. I am using it with the Moto Razr V3. It works well and is easy to use. It is also fairly comfortable.My problem is that the rubber earpiece fell apart. It provides a cushion for your ear. It would be easy to replace (it simply snaps on and off). I called Motorola to order some (I figured a dozen would last me a year!) I was told that they don't sell the earpiece separately. Since it is in warranty the only way I can fix it is to ship it to them and they will then ship me a new one. So, I have to go without it for about 2 weeks. If the next earpiece lasts as long as the first one, I'll be without the headset 2 weeks out of 4 while it is being replaced!Hello Moto! Get a clue! sell me replacement earpieces!"
5,An informative guide on the remarkable power of the brain.,"Creativity exists only for the young. If by the age of 30 you have not written a novel, composed a symphony or invented something, you never will. Gene Cohen, an expert on aging, has one word for this notion: nonsense. The thinking and intellectual skills of the elderly can stay remarkably sharp into the most advanced old age. Numerous scientific studies indicate that the brains of the elderly, if not affected by illness or accident, work better in many ways than those of people in their 20s and 30s. Cohen explores these and related topics in his fascinating, fact-filled book about old people and their superbly functioning brains. getAbstract suggests that this groundbreaking work has much to offer readers of all ages. And if you're worried about getting old - even though you'll still be smart - it is better than not getting old, after all."
2,"Some good information, but...","I wish when I was young someone had sat me down and explained explained some of the life stages I would go through as a teen, young adult, young married person, young father, and a young ""provider.""The good thing about this book is that it gives some clues about the stages people typically go through from about 55 onward. Since I'm 49 I appreciate the clues about what is coming.The bad thing about this book is that it only touches the surface of the subject it addresses, and the writer is not extremely gifted at conveying his material.Nevertheless, the writer performs a valuable service and I'm sure he does the best he can."
4,The Mature Brain: Where Wonder Never Ceases,"This book is a historical marker in the rapidly growing field of cognitive development. Standing on the shoulders of Piaget and Erickson, and even Freud, Dr. Cohen creates four distinct yet integrated stages for the mature mind. Together they prove that the difference between adolescence and retirement (like heaven and hell) is about half an inch.Remarkably readable (and approachable) this book can best be summed up by one of the author's own stories, about Charles Darwin. Darwin's youthful mind took him to the Galapagos Islands, where he gathered insights and information. In his fifties, Mr. Darwin's mature mind coalesced those thoughts into The Origin of the Species.That is the cognitive difference between intelligence and wisdom, between youth and maturity."
3,Reads like a Fairy tale,"A real fun quick read. Corso wrote this in about a month while living in Paris and it is his only novel. Nothing life changing about it, but it's filled with comedy and satire to make for an entertaining read."
5,Still a great read,"I first read this on publication in 1961. It's Corso""s only novel and is well worth your time. This is a nice new edition. The 1st from France goes for over $100. Peter E Scott of Ridge Books"
4,Vapo Steam,It helps with snuffy noses. It is good. Make ssure your humidifier allows this to be mixed inside the water or just in a cup on the top.
4,Difficult to put a price on good night's sleep!,"$13 might seem like a lot of money for a bottle of cold medication but it's really difficult to put a price on good nights sleep!I was a little put off by the price of Vicks VapoSteam but I didn't realize how long this stuff will last. This bottle, for my Vicks humidifier, will definitely last the entire winter season, so the price isn't so much when you think about it that way.I worried that the smell might be too strong or even irritating but it doesn't overwhelm at all, it's actually quite comforting as it just sort of lofts around my bedroom.I don't use it only when I have a cold but when my head or nasal passages are just stuffed up from daily allergies (my cats!:) or the dry, discomforting winter air that's so irritating to my nose. About 10 minutes after the humidifier is turned on, my breathing is so much easier and pleasant, I really appreciate this stuff."
1,No like.,"Nao gostamos do produto, pois colocamos no quarto do nosso baby, depois de alguns dias, estava com mofo nas cortinas, janelas e em alguns moveis. Se fosse possível queríamos até realizar troca por um outro que nao tenha água e sim somente o vick. Nao gostamos. Nao aprovado."
1,"Excessively priced, barely effective.","I can't remember exactly but recall, not many years ago when I bought and began to use my Vicks Humidifier and Vicks Vaposteam the Vaposteam cost a couple of dollars less. To this day, I'm not sure whether it was effective, but at the time I was willing to pay for the pleasant Vick's odor; having seen the current cost, I'll do without this 'luxurious' but very doubtful benefit."
1,Caused Terrible Sinus Headache,"I have used Vic's Vaporub since I was a child, and always loved the scent, so I thought this product would be the same. There are some similairities, but this product smells awful. Not only that, but after having it on for ten or fifteen minutes, I got a terrible sinus headache. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Dynamicism + Rhythmicism = Acoustacism,"A drop or two of Jackson Browne, A couple shots of Ben Harper, A splish, splash of James Taylor, A lovin' spoonful of blues mixed into one disc that rocks. A definite must have in your music collection. Kalai is destined to be a star if he hasn't already reached that status..."
4,Good Book,This book is informative and easy for the beginner to follow. The flow is logical and an easy straight forward read. The only drawback is the index of the book. More information should be referenced in the index instead of the reader having to skim to find key points. But all in all a good reference tool to use Pro Tools......
3,Not for beginners,"I'm new to digital audio, so of course to Pro Tools. I purchased this book as an introductory handbook and had to return it. I found it assumed knowledge I did not have and left a lot unexplained. The explanations that were present were good, but I found it confusing that the discussion might refer to an illustration as much as 3 pages earlier. If I had a basic grounding in Pro Tools I might have found this helpful but as a beginner it was beyond me."
5,Awesome,"This figure is awesome... I am not a MINT collector so i decided to open it. Believe me its even BETTER opened! Though the ""force"" levatation isnt the best its pretty awesome. And the mini lightsaber?AMAZING! Overall i great figure..Get it fast its rare i am lucky i found this AND anakin skywalker Hangar Duel:)! Other figures to get:Count dookuFlipping figuresPadme amidala"
5,"""Cop"" Yoda Jedi Master--by Mason","Awesome this toy is! Ha, ha, ha. That's how Yoda speaks. This toy rules, I'll tell you. Turn the upper part of the base and Yoda will levitate in the air. Base has a detachable edge that Yoda can use to levitate with his blue force power. He's got a cane but doesn't fit well in his hand, though. And he's got a dinky lightsaber with a removable blade. This toy goes well with Count Dooku, since he and the old Jedi fight each other on Geonosis. And the funny part is how Yoda keeps jumping up and down over Dooku."
5,This is a quality action figure,"I'm somewhat of a collector of Star Wars action figures, and this is one of the best ones yet. Yoda was the best character in Attack of the Clones, and this figure is just as good. Although very difficult to find, it's worth the search. Yoda comes with a small lightsaber, a lightning effect, a walking staff, and a hangar pod. The hangar pod has a piece that you can pull off to make Yoda hurl it at his enemy. Yoda has incredible detail, especially with the wrinkles on his face. The only bad thing about it is the lightsaber doesn't stay in his hand very well, especially if you're making him duel with another character. But that fact doesn't really take away from the quality of this toy. I give it five stars."
5,"Little Master, I am.","This incredible action figure is the best one you can find. He comes with so much stuff that he should be worth a lot more. (Don't tell anyone, though.) He comes with his awesome smaller-than-usual lightsaber, and is very flexible. Both arms can move up, down, and sideways. He has a levitating platform that moves him up and down (Makes him look like he is floating.) And his face looks so realistic. ""Sorry that I'm very, VERY, VERY rare, I am."" says Yoda. ""But be brave, you must. If you get me, scream for all you're worth."" (Not really)"
5,Useful hands-on information on the many tools available,"Government has no choice but to look for ways to work better. The push for reform of public administration is real, and fortunately there are numerous success stories from some reinvention pioneers that can help light the path toward improvement for the rest of us. The text profiles a fairly comprehensive package of the tools. Most reforms or best practices approaches should not seek to duplicate others' successes but rather should be viewed as guidance by illustrating successful principles for adapation. This volume provides excellent profiles of successes and useful information that should be invaluable to those seeking such guidance. This volume will be one of many resources my county is using to develop its performance initiative to ensure we are operating in a manner consistent with the public's expectations for our use of their dollars."
2,Guide to Owning a Labrador Retriever,"This book was informative on the basics, but did not go into a lot of depth on any one topic. I bought it because I was researching the breed, but I feel I need to buy additional material in order to answer my questions, since I plan on being a new parent to a pup."
3,Not really a guide,"I have to say that I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping for more information to be contained within the book but this is more like a book that you would give an elementary school child. The book gives only superficial information about the breed. I think that people can find more information on most online sites,i.e. Wikidpedia, etc."
1,Wrong Book,I ordered this book but Amazon shipped me a different one. Customer Service will not return my emails to get it fixed.
4,Great carseat!,Love this carseat--bought it as a extra for us to carry around our grandson without having to take his out of his parents' car.
4,Good Choice,"I Bought this car seat as an extra for when I need to transport my grandson. It is a solid seat, easy to use, not heavy so it is easy to take in and out of the car, which I need. I would prefer a little bit more reclining but the few times that I use it the child is fine with it. It has a five point harness so the child is secure in the seat. It is also has the right amount of padding. I gave it just 4 points because I have the Evenflow Triumph as well although it is heavy and not a good choice of a seat to take in and out of a car, It is actually a luxurious safe seat for a child."
4,As a new grandmother...,"this works well for us. It eliminates my daughter having to carry one on the plane when visiting with her son. We did have to have a neighbor with young children assist us with the installation, otherwise I would've given 5 stars."
3,nice but wrong weight listed,"I purchsed this after seeing it in store, but the store was out. I needed a new seat for my 3 y.o. son, who is about 34 lbs. On the website it said the weight limit was 80+ pounds. However once it got to my house and I looked at the instructions it said 40lbs max! Needless to say it went back into the box and was returned. I ended up going back to the store and purchasing an eddie bower convertable and have been very happy with it so far."
2,Car Seat Not User Friendly,"I am disappointed with this car seat. I used it during my 35-lb grandson's five-day visit last week. I found:* The crotch strap too short. It is only 5 inches (total from the seat pan to the upper tip of the release buckle) and there is no adjustment. It requires effort to reach between the child's thighs to insert the buckle tongues into the buckle. Because it is so short, it also causes discomfort to the crotch of my grandson. The owner's manual shows the buckle rides higher near the stomach area which would have been more comfortable.* The extra seat cushion is ineffective. It is not attached to anything. The weight of the child keeps the bottom down but the side flaps tend to get tangled with the seat harness. I end up not using it.I bought this car seat based on other users' reviews. My experience keeps me from recommending this to others."
3,Great Secondary Car Seat,"We picked this car seat to have an extra for use in taxis and on planes, so that we don't have to uninstall the seat that's in our car. The appeal was price, weight, and ease of installation, and we haven't been disappointed."
3,basic value for money car seat,this is a basic value for money car seat . nothing special with the car seat just serves the purpose . Cushion is very thin .
2,Doesn't Recline,"I purchased this convertible car seat to replace one that reclines while rear or forward facing. The seat has a ""recline"" lever, but it is only one position and is required for rear-facing and must not be used for forward facing. In other words, this product doesn't recline in any position, it simply has two positions, and the rear-facing position is more reclined. The ""adjustable pillow"" simply has velcro on in and the velcro doesn't stick unless the pillow is in the top position, which according to the manual, shouldn't be used for the pillow."
4,A good buy,"We bought the car seat for our granddaughter. It is a real bargain, very safe, functional for a good long time and attractive. The only downside was that it was a challenge to install it initially to fit our granddaughter."
4,Decent for the price,"This car seat has really high safety test results, which in the end is probably what we should look for in a car seat. I think it serves it's purpose, but it is definitely not fancy. It looks quite generic, and the padding is very thin. I imagine it wouldn't be too comfortable on a long car trip."
2,A Disapointment,"I bought this for my 2 year old for Christmas last year. The swing does not work properly. It hits the sides and does not swing freely. The high chair only works for small dolls. The bed(s) work fine. One other thing, the monitor has no volume control and it is loud!!! All in all, this was not worth the expense."
5,The Little Mama Loves It!,"We bought this for our 2 and a half year old daughter and she loves it! Assembly was relatively easy, had some issues with some of the screws, but that was easily remedied. So far, the majority of her dolls fit into it and even if one or two don't, she still has plenty that can make the rounds in the swing and feeding chair! There is a minor durability issue with the swing in that the connections are plastic and will wear out over time, but that can be dealt with when the time comes, with a little innovation and creativity! Overall, we are very satisfied!"
1,You can't even put this thing together!!!,"Oh my goodness. I couldn't even get this thing together. Why? Because the holes were too little for the screws, and it's plastic. So I went and bought a power drill to really drill through this thing, and it worked for a couple of the holes, but then I tried to put the bassinet part together and it kept coming apart. The hole was too big. I got sooo frustrated with that thing, I put the whole thing in the trash. I would have gotten my money back, but I had bought it last Christmas, and it was too late to complain. Especially when the receipt is long gone. Get something that doesn't require the assembly of plastic parts and screws!! (Well, at least this product, because my daughter has a kitchen set that's plastic, and it was hard to get together, but not as difficult as this thing!)"
4,Hope I never need it,"I product looks great. Can't give it a 5 cause I haven't used it yet. Hope I never have too. Just hope it works the way they say it would . Most people give it a 5, but they haven't use it. So thats why I can't give it a 5."
2,Overpriced,"This worked as advertised, but if it overheats its shuts off for a while to cool down.I saw another motorcyclist with a Cycle Pump and was envious. It comes in its own bag, with all the adaptors and cords packaged in there. The Cycle pump has a better head to attach the hose to the tire. Its simply a better thought out and designed piece of kit that this pump.This comes in a large-ish case with the bottle of slime (which I didn't plan on using). The case is larger than needed to hold the pump, yet not really large enough to hold other tools. Its cheap plastic and is getting beat up looking from being packed in the tool bag.I'm planning to get the cycle pump and use it on my good bike and use the cheapy slime for now on my dirt bike."
4,Emergency Use Only,"This is a neat little/portable kit that's small enough to fit in a saddle bag of a motorcycle and it also contains a 8 oz container of Slime Tire Sealant, which by the way is only enough for just one tire repair according to the directions. The compressor is small and noisy, it can only run for 8 minutes at a time as it becomes very hot (this could be a problem if it's too hot to throw back in the saddle bag). My purchase is solely to have a repair kit on my motorcycle and to use it in an emergency only.Good kit for a good price."
5,Just the right size,This fits easily into the saddle bags on my motorcycle and is more than powerful enough to fill the tires using the motorcycle battery as a power source
1,No Go,"Plugged the unit into the battery tender lead permanently attached on my motorcycle battery. It pumped air for 2 seconds and quit, never to operate again. Sent it back for a refund."
4,Fits Pharmacy Brand Digital Thermometer!,Wasn't sure if the BD Digital Probe Covers would fit my pharmacy brand digital thermometer -- but they are a perfect fit and the price is right!
4,Ending to end the west,"In this final instalment of the deadlands 3 part series of a playable storyline we come upon the truth of Stone, the stone he has stolen, and a look into the next era of books Hell on Earth. If you have bought the previous issues you must buy this one! Even if you are just looking for a good story this is a wild and weird tale that will take you into the depths of fear itself"
5,good read for soldiers,"from private to general, really, I suggest at least reading it once. In our professions, they equipment may be different, but the principles-the same.be cruel, hard and dont hesitate."
4,boook,"this book has imensely inspired my life and moral. i haven't changed myself for the books sake, but merely incorporated the books ""principalities"" into my life as i best see fit to encourage a better life. the package came in ample time and was boxed safelythankyoudurell"
5,Book for class,Bought this for class. It worked well for class; however I wanted to sell it ASAP. It is well-written in an easy manner. Glad to have bought this product and recommend this.
2,The Prince,"Not sure why, but I am unable to get into this book even though it was recommended by a friend."
4,ok,the book is small it fits into the palm of my hand. and it really isn't a hard back it's more like a paperback lamented. the commentary is ok i think i would of rather bought an ordinary copy instead but it's not to bad
2,Machiavelli was a loser,which is why the hero worship evident in these reviews in the 21st century weird me out. He is example of those who cannot do teach...teach eloquently repeatedly and stupidly simplified and sure the masses will listen for what...half a millenium? And continue to justify horror because that is just how we are. Read cum grano sal forgive me my latin rusty half c since Jebs
3,"Prince is great, this edition is OK","First off, if I am reviewing The Prince in and of itself I give it 5 stars, but I'm going to dedicate this review to this particular translations and Kindle edition.I'm not a huge fan of the translation. It's definitely readable and captures the meanings and themes of the text, but I feel that there are better translations available.The formatting as far as Kindle goes is decent, but everything kind of just runs together. I can't really complain too much for it being a free edition, but specialized Kindle formatting is definitely lacking."
3,more than a book -an influential work,"It is evident after reading this that ""The Prince"" left a footprint through years in politics. Seems like a guidebook to kings and leaders.but just not my type of book that I enjoy the most."
5,Great book.,"It's a wonderful book .I am telling you some leaders follow the arts of leadership from the ""Prince"".Knowledge is Power.I recommend for people who are interested in the intrigue of art of power."
5,Must read for life,"This has been one of my favorite books thus far. It isn't too long, but contained within it is invaluable wisdom. Considered by many as politically incorrect or immoral, Machiavelli's work is the perfect guide to gaining and maintaining power over people. These skills, in any context, can always prove helpful."
4,Great Overnight Diaper,"We use Huggies Overnites every night. They are not 100% leakproof, but our son (18 months, size 5) doesn't wake up from a wet diaper anymore. I can buy these at our local supermarket for a little less, but the convenience of shipping is nice."
5,SHOULD HAVE TRIED THESE SOONER!!!,"My son began leaking a lot at night. He'd wake up with wet pants or a wet shirt. I tried using diapers a size larger at night, Huggies and Pampers, and it did not work. Initially, I didn't believe the Huggies Overnite diapers would work. They don't appear any larger than his usual daytime diapers. Was I wrong! These diapers are a DREAM for night time. We haven't had one leak. I only wish they made them in larger sizes for when he outgrows these. No more leaks with these diapers! Wish I had tried these first. We use Kirkland (Costco) size 5 during the day (great diapers) and Huggies Overnites, at night. No leaks."
1,It worked for a little while,"I have owned many VCRs, this one worked for almost 2 months.It was only used in a bedroom, never used to record only play.for some reason now the picture does not project clear. The sound comes through but the picture is fuzzy. Its not the tracking or channel. Cannot figure out the problem. I have tried to disconnect and reconnect but still the same results. I would like to return this but no longer have the box."
4,"Nice clock, but does make noise after a while","The sound of a ticking clock is maddening to me, I bought this clock and for about 3 months it was nice and silent, but like others have said it does start to make some ticking sounds eventually, still, very nice looks and it does keep great time, but I am donating mine to someone else that can tolerate the ticking."
3,Product not as specified... Letters are smaller then they appear in photo...,"I received this clock yesterday and was a little disapointed. It states that ""on the hour"" there is a red dot to highlight each 5 minute interval. THIS IS NOT TRUE. THERE ARE NO RED DOTS WHICH HIGHLIGHT EACH FIVE MINUTE INTERVAL.I was also disapointed in the size of the numbers. The clock will be adequate to read if you install it in the kitchen and read the time from the kitchen. However, if you want to install the clock in the kitchen and read the time from the living room, your in trouble. The numbers arent big enough. I have EXCELLENT vision and really had to strain myself to tell the time from the next room over (a distance of 20 feet).But other than this, the clock appears to be well made."
5,Quiet!,"A good looking, substantial feeling clock, and the best part is that it's quiet. No ""tick tick tick"" as it moves. It does not have a sweep hand, which doesn't matter to me, but might bother some people."
2,Too loud !,"I had high hopes for this clock, but unfortunately it is DEFINITELY too loud. It does not have a second hand, but it does make a loud 'TIC TOC' sound nonetheless. Has to go back.BJ"
4,limited two year warranty,Product features said '1 Year Manufacturer's Warranty'. Product Description said 'Guaranteed by a three year manufacturer's warranty.'.The truth is: this product has two year warranty. That is written on the back of package box. :-)
5,The Best Kitchen Retro Clock,This item is a beauty. I was very happy with the quality of the clock and it exceeded my expectations.
4,Green retro clock,The clock has been returned for a credit. There was nothing wrong with the clock - just the wrong shade of green.
3,Infinity Instruments Retro Wall Clock,"The clock is definitely quiet, as advertised. The clock is so thick from front to back that hanging it required a very long nail. The glass is somewhat reflective making it a bit hard to see from bed. Otherwise, styling is cool, size is perfect."
1,"Defective,had 2 that both stopped working. Rip-off!",Cheapo. Stopped working within days. Tried two kinds of new batteries and still doesn't work. Do not really like the color of clock face as it looked slightly green-tinged instead of white like I expected.
2,Ingredients misrepresented,"I am disappointed to find that this product contains two of the ingredients I was seeking to avoid: perfume and parabens. They were not present in the wonderful Kamill hand creme for sensitive skin that I purchased in Germany, and I thought I had found the right product because they are not listed in the ingredients on this site. But after receiving the container, I see that it contains these things. I feel duped."
4,Neutrogena Visibly Firm Eye Treatment Concealer,"This is a very fine product in and of itself. I find it necessary to use a little moisturizer before applying the concealer for a smoother application. I find that no other makeup foundation is needed after I apply the concealer so I move on to the rest of my face. I have found, though, that if I have a blemish I wish to hide, this concealer is good for that use also."
4,Nails,"Any Gabriel Dupree mystery by Peter Bowen is a literary gem, and this novel is no exception. Aided by a wonderful cast of eccentric family and neighbors, Dupree again unravels a knot of murder, greed, and human folly. I particularly enjoyed the prominent role played by the loveably klutzy priest, Father Van Den Heuvel, in this book."
2,Mislead,"The picture is the updated version, but in the comments it said 2005 version. I had to go buy it from my school's bookstore which was very expensive."
4,"Good Reviews, Info and Pictures","I'm not a real mechanic, just trying to keep my own cars going. I bought this manual along with another brand so I'd have at least two views and instructions for most jobs. This manual is VERY thorough and written for a novice like me to understand. After using it several times and relying on it, I would have no hesitation recommending it to anyone needing a little extra help with their car!"
5,Human Senator Padme Amidala,My 2nd figure in my AOTC collection. When I got her I played with her forever. I even brought her to school. Later I took her chain of and then lost it. I didnt really fing anything I didnt like except for her right arm. It always popped back up. Great for your Senate Collection. ENJOY!
3,Why no 12-inch of the same character?,"Of all the characters in the ""Star Wars"" saga, my favorite are the heroines in the movies. I really like Padme ""Amidala"" Naberrie and Princess Leia Organa. However, I am only interested in the 12-inch figures they make of the heroines. When they made a small action figure, I thought Hasbro had flipped its lid. Therefore, I am asking whoever is in charge of the company in Pawtucket to please put out a 12-inch Padme Amidala action figure. I would really like to own one."
4,Padme is so cool!,"Padme is the first Episode II figure that I bought and I don't regret it. She is a very cool figure and looks excellent on display, chained up with the blaster rifle in her hand. The only problem is that her arm sticks out ..., if you want it to go down beside her, then you have to hold her waist to the right. Also, it would have been nice if the chain came of her arm, but her hand is in an awkward position, not allowing the chain past it. This is a must have for your Star Wars collection, but because of her ""deformaties"" I give her a four."
5,"Good fun for the kids, but not the collectors","I must say, that I was let down by this figure.I think that with it's action feature- the quick draw- set in motion by the twisting of the waist, it will please the audience it was aimed at: children. But I buy figures only for display purposes, and unlike other collectors, I open them up.The trouble with Padme Amidala: arena escape, is that she can only hold one pose thanks to the action feature. I guess they inserted the break-apart column to make it a bit more exciting, and give her some more possible poses.as well as the column, she also comes with a blaster, and a metal chain that's connected to her left arm. Her holster is also removable. Why, I don't know.For articulation, she has her hips, neck, and left shoulder- waist and right shoulder are moveable but canot be set in a pose.I gave this a five star rating for fun, not because I myself got a lot of fun out of it, but the kids will."
1,Meant to stay in the package?,"As toys, particularly action figures, become more important as items of acquisition for adult collectors than as playthings for children, they also appear to be increasingly designed to stay in their package. Case in point, this Padmé Amidala figure: though it can stand up with a bit of effort, it's not really meant to do anything else. A lack of articulation in the joints means no poses other than the one it was molded to take, and the figure's blister pack seems designed to conceal the fact that one of the toy's arms is significantly smaller and thinner than the other.As a result, there's little reason to purchase Padmé's figure, as she can't be played with in any meaningful fashion, and her body is so poorly put together that she seems like a deformed reflection of the original character. A very disappointing toy that will be wanted only by completists."
1,not suitable,"I find this toy to be very unsuitable for young children, the sex appeal is one of which should be aimed towards adults not children, I knowI would certainly not allow my child to play with a toy where her breasts show through her shirt and are too big for her body, they should have made one for children and kept this one strictly for adults, dont use sex to sell to our children"
3,This shaver didn't work any better for me ...,"This shaver didn't work any better for me than others that I've used. I did like the rotating blade. It made it easy to change to a new blade. I also liked the design, which made it easy to use in the shower. Overall, this is a good product and I'd recommend it to others."
2,I didn't particularly care for this product. It ...,"I didn't particularly care for this product. It wasn't a close shave like I'm used to when using other razor brands. However, it is easy to hold -- made for a woman's hand. I did like the fact that it holds the blades. I have small children and this is a plus that the additional blades are contained within the product. Overall, I might use this in the wintertime when a close shave wasn't as crucial -- but not in the summertime when wearing shorts, bathing suit, etc."
3,"Unfortunately, I didn't like using the Flicker. Although ...","Unfortunately, I didn't like using the Flicker. Although I did like the idea of just being able to twist to get a new blade. I didn't like the shape, it was hard to use in some areas, also it didn't provide a close enough shave for me. The shape also made it scrape off the shaving cream on the sides of the blade, so on the next pass there was no shaving cream left where the blade would pass."
5,Have not found a better shaver in 30 years!,"Yes, I've been using this product for over 30 years. Periodically I try another, usually highly touted, shaver and I've always been disappointed. A Flicker blade lasts many times longer, rarely nicks, and is so much cheaper. I was dismayed when the last store I knew that carried it stopped carrying it. I'm so happy to have found it here through Amazon!"
1,If I could give the Women's Shaver by ...,"If I could give the Women's Shaver by Persona less than a """"1"""" rating, I sure would. This thing is AWFUL!! First, it is extremely awkward to hold and handle. Second (and more importantly) it just doesn't work! It leaves stubble even if you shave over the same spot three or more time! You just cannot get a close shave with this. Another concern is that there is no safety cap or anything on the blade. I would never buy one!"
3,eh...,"not really hard, solid facts. just a collection of little pick-me-ups and quotes. not worth the price."
1,disgusted me more than it helped,"I regret buying this book. I was/am stressed out about getting in to college, and I expected this book to help. It just made me angry with its sugary-sweet spiritual advice like ""reach for the stars"" and ""dig deep into the essence of your dreams"" from Mimi Doe. It also stressed me out even more because of Hernandez's definitive-sounding instructions like, ""Don't sign up for AP classes unless you plan on taking the AP exams"" ""get a job"", and ""[at an interview] boys can wear chinos or pants other than jeans with any regular shoe (as opposed to sneakers) with a button-down shirt or polo (no tie necessary)...Try to avoid any extreme statements (nose rings, Mohawks, spiked collars, tatoos, etc.).""This book is just... creepy."
5,Just in Time!,"I just received this book and want to kiss the authors myself. My son is a high school junior and the frenzy over at our house has begun. I'm stressed, my husband's stressed, and my son Josh is a mess. I read about this book coming up and preordered a copy. It arrived and Josh disappeared for about an hour and then threw it onto my lap saying, ""Well this makes sense Mom you read it.""I did and feel calmer already. It puts things in perspective without telling us to give up. Sure, Josh can do this thing...without losing his mind."
5,Great book with great advice!,"This is a wonderful book filled with great tips to help high school students ease their worry about getting into college. With practical knowledge, insider information, and a real understanding about the emotional challenges of the college application process, this book really speaks to students themselves, rather than their parents. Perfect for any student preparing for the college admissions process! Kudos to the authors for providing a resource kids will actually WANT to read!"
2,Better to save your money,"Having read Hernandez's high-powered ""A is for Admissions,"" I was very disappointed by this product resulting from the collaboration of two seeming experts. Each page contains one advice, with only a few sentences of explanation, so the content of the book could've easily been compacted into fewer pages. Also, the advice seems to be a downgrade compared to those offered in Hernandez's other book; some are rehashed, while others non-brainers. Save your money and time by avoiding this book. If you want sound admissions advice, get Hernandez's other book instead."
2,Be aware of gas,"I bought these thinking they were a great price for large pieces of beef jerky for dogs. I overlooked the dimensions in the description. My mistake.My second disappointment was the gas and loose stool they gave my huskies. Unfortunately, I will be passing these treats to someone else. $30 down the drain."
5,Step by step help,"This book has step-by-step help for people who have never maintained or repaired a pinball machine. The book has a full section on general repairs, another full section on fixing flippers, and chapters on what to look for when buying a machine, disassembling and setting up the machine, protecting the painted backglass and playing field, checking fuses and checking batteries for leaks.The book has information about the balls, rubber rings, locks and missing keys, lightbulb types that should not be used, wiring problems, tips for making the machine faster and more fun to play, and where to find parts and game manuals.This book gathers all this information in one volume, with a separate terminology section that describes the parts and operations of a pinball machine, a lengthy index, and over eighty illustrations. Highly recommended, best guide of its kind."
4,Picked up some good hints,Pinball restoration is a very opinionated hobby. Everyone has their idea of how it should be done.I think this book follows the more 'standard practices' and does not do anything too weird.I did pickup some very good hints and tips that helped me restore my Black Pyramid pinball.
4,inball Machine Care & Maintience,Good coverage on Williams Pinball machines. Would like more devoted on my machine being Fire Pinball.Overall Item is good and the price was excellent. Thank You. Frank
4,Good starter book,Great for when I got started in the hobby a few years back.Have loaned it to people that got their own machine and needed a good start.Grabbed this book off the shelf again when I got my first Electro Mechanical Pinball.
4,"Pictures are good, but don't over do them","The book has some valuable information on golf swing. I especially like the idea picturing a certain part of the motion with a image. But somehow, there're too many of them, which miss the point a little. One picture is worth a thousand words, what about 200 pictures? This means an overflow of information. I still like this book, but I think novice golfer or people who want to learn from a book should also pick up Ben Hogan's 5 fundamentals first."
5,Golf is a funny game,This is a very well written book and should help anybody who wants to further their golfing skills. The problem is that it is dealing with a very complicated subject. There is only one good golf swing in the whole world and that is the one that works for you. If a golf instruction book happens to fit your profile then you are in luck. I personally have 967 different swings and I never know who's going to show up. I find many more benefits in playing golf than just the score. If one associates the quality of their life with their golf score then either they don't understand golf or don't understand life but one of them is amiss.
1,Not again!!!,I saw Mr. Bradley on Golf Channel Academy Live and was impressed. I then got online and waited until his book price got low enough for me to want to buy it. The other reviews seemed overwhelmingly good and every one was impressed. I got it finally. What a let down. While the pictures are great and yet disturbing in some cases I have yet to complete reading it.I cannot get past Mr. Bradley's overanalysis of the whole swing process. If you buy anything (and I don't mean to endorse) get anything by A.J. Bonar or just to go your pro and get at least 2 lessons. Golf does not have to be Rocket science although Mr. Bradley seems to write as though it is.
1,This technique didn't work for me,The wide stance advocated was hard on my back & my creaky old body simply couldn't execute it.
1,"Maybe I'm Just Not Justin Rose, but","This is a beautiful picture book. All the things Bradley says about biomechanics may be true, but no one past the first days of youth should go at golf in this way. His body will never stand for it. There are no laws of the golf swing except for one: hit the ball to the right of your intended target to make the ball go straight. Everything else is style. Those who want to believe golf is complicated and that secrets exist should add this one to their library"
3,Some good tips,"This book has some good tips on the golf swing, but I wouldn't call it a must read. It also shows a number of swing faults and how to prevent them.It does have one of the best descriptions on how to grip the golf club of any book I've read. That one section makes it worth the money.It does assume there is only one correct system for swinging the golf club (the modern, coiling swing). If you use another swing method (swing axis, traditional swing) some of the tips may not apply."
2,Too much,"Maybe a low-handicapper will beg to differ, but like several other reviewers, I thought the author went into too much detail. This would certainly seem to be the case for a high-handicapper to truly benefit from this book.At some point when my swing is consistent enough and my handicap is in the teens, I may try to re-read this book to see if some of the fine-tuning principles can help me further improve.But in the meantime, I've found books like ""Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing"" much more helpful, at least at this stage with my golf game."
3,back & forth,"A palindrome: a word phrase or sentence that reads the same forwards & backwards. Repeating images/people/thoughts/phrases-- those aren't palindromes-- neither is bookending ideas.The proper names work, & I appreciate Solondz's efforts to do something different structurally, but I can't help but feel he's pointing fingers & talking down to the people who support his work. Storytelling was overwrought with boundary pushing, and Palindromes ambled along in one too many directions. I appreciate ambiguity, although I wonder if Dawn's death was just a tool to keep Welcome To The Dollhouse fans interested.Happiness was squirm worthy, & smart, not just shocking for the sake of it. I will admit though, when I read the screenplay, as opposed to watching the film, I wanted to take a shower. Dirty! Dirty!One more movie about the underdog (poor weiner dog!) raising arms and sinking again, no matter how it's disguised, and I'm done watching."
2,Todd Solondz missed on this one.,"I loved ""Happiness"" by Todd Solondz, his ""Storytelling"" was OK, but this movie is almost painful to watch. Behind each scene you see the director trying to be *controversial* through exploiting human drama. And it simply does not work. Not in this movie. I was anticipating this film for quite some time, reading all the praise from the critics, and my big disappointment came as the result. Yes, some of you may enjoy Palindromes, and this only means that you have richer imagination and are able to look through the director's pretense. But I wasn't able, and this was the last movie by Solondz that I saw. He peaked at ""Happiness"", but now he stinks."
1,More torturous sports from Todd Solondz,"In ""Palindromes"" Solondz has found another novel way to tell us how miserable and futile life can be. He's great at pinpointing where it hurts, but I think I'm ready to call the doctor.There's a scene in Preston Sturges' ""The Lady Eve"" where Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck are on the deck of a cruise ship, and Henry Fonda is staring out over the water saying something like, ""I feel like I've known you all my life. I keep meeting you, etc."" ""Palindromes"" stretches that idea over 110 minutes, using a young girl who desperately wants to get pregnant portrayed by eight different actresses. When she's finally successful, you'll be mumbling to yourself, ""This is so wrong. This is so wrong.""Solondz reportedly wanted Heather Matarazzo to reprise her role as Dawn Weiner from ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" for this film; when she declined Solondz had her character commit suicide."
3,A Challenging Film,"This movie was difficult to watch. It employs several actresses for the main character, not all of whom are at the same skill level, and the narrative jogs along at an uneven rate. In addition, the subject matter is very dark, even when presented in a seemingly lighthearted fashion. However, this film is a wonderful discussion starter. The issues of the reproductive rights movement are covered in a thoughtful way. This movie is a good way to get a group of people talking about the value conflicts within the pro-choice community. I wouldn't watch this film solely for entertainment, even in an ""artsy"" mood, but it's an interesting one to screen to start a discussion."
1,"Not creative, but twisted. Not depressing, but disturbing.","The tendency is to label any sort of unusual movie as 'interesting.' In this one, the director's imagination runs wild, which in itself is not bad or unusual. Good movies often come out of such mindsets. But things do go horribly wrong sometimes, and Palindromes is a classic instance. Simply a series of haphazard events which were strewn together, with the central role played by as many actors as they are different, Palindromes ultimately lacks direction or meaning. At best it leaves one dumbfounded but is otherwise a sheer palaver. It is the sort of movie which, when it ends, a (polite) reaction is: ""Ok."" Three thumbs down."
2,rotten.com,maybe it's the fact that i was exposed to weird things during my formative teenage years that i still have some kind of curiosity toward solondz et al. regardless this was tedious to watch and i wish i hadn't.
4,An Absurd Fable About Innocence,"Director Todd Stolonz has always made controversial films (""Storytelling"", ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"", Happiness""). This time the controversy is simply about a girl that wants to have a baby ever since she could talk. Stolonz always has a trick up his sleeve and this time, Aviva, a young girl is portrayed by several different actresses at different ages. They are small, big, white, black, freckle-faced, skinny, fat, you name it. It's confusing at first until you realize that `perhaps' Stolonz is using them as a universal theme. No matter. The acting is amazing, in that some characters are banally subtle and others are manically intense. From a middle class home with normal parents to an extended family of adopted children with disabilities, ""Palidromes"" never allows you to lose interest. Aviva is on her own road trip and encounters all kinds of people with many different opinions. It's not as good as ""Happiness"" or ""Storytelling"" but it's worth viewing."
3,Ok movie but waste of money.,"It seemed like this movie tried to come off and bold, shocking and controvercial but came off as perverse. I am a big fan of ""Happiness"" and enjoyed ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and "" Storytelling"", other movies by this director. This movie was a bit weak for me and dragged along. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was fresh and had a couple of good lines. I don't think I would get anything from repeated viewings so I wouldn't suggest to buy this movie, rent it instead."
4,free thinking film for free thinking viewers,"Well...I liked it. You wont see Spielberg or any of the other ""great"" filmmakers take on such a difficult subject without making it a maudlin melodrama. Very good script writing and directing (after all most of these people in the film are not polished professional actors). This movie will make you have a talk with your kids, at least it should. But what I enjoyed mostly about the film is that is amoral. All the players are realistically represented. Watch for yourself if you like movies that don't hold your hand as you watch it."
4,Makes your skin crawl!,"This is one of the better suspense/mystery novels I have read for a while. The writing is excellent, the characters are well developed, and the plot is an original one. One of the reviewers complained about the language, but the book is dealing with a pychopathic/schizophrenic looney who probably isn't going to say ""darn"" or ""shucks"". Mr. Ames really put alot of effort into keeping his characters true to their natures. Some authors start out with a character acting or speaking one way then suddenly change personalities half-way through the story.This story is disturbing, exciting, creepy, and will keep you on the edge of your seat with a can of raid in your lap! It's a wonderful work of fiction that will keeping you reading long past your bedtime."
2,Venom lacks bite,"There are many excellent novels of serial killers out there-- this is not one of them. In fact, it is not even a good one. The killer is not convincingly creepy, many of the police procedures are questionable, the action lacks suspense and strains credulity, and some of the characters border on stereotypes (the killer is physically deformed, the black hooker is straight out of a '70s exploitation movie). The only interesting aspect of the novel was officer Courtney Bedell's relationship with her drug-addicted sister! Were it not for this, the novel would be more reminiscent of bad pulp fiction from the '30s and '40s. I had to force myself to read the last 100 or so pages."
1,1 Star is way too much,"I'm going to keep this simple --- do NOT waste your money or time on this book. It is terrible. It was so bad, I kept thinking that perhaps it was a 'spoof.' However, I'm convinced the author was serious. He needs to keep his day job. I can only assume that the other reviewers tastes are far less discriminating than mine."
3,Why buy the box?,"Installed from CD, then updated it from the website. After a 10MB download (via my poor, SLOW dial-up service), I was finally up to date. Why bother with the CD; I can only hope the downloaded version is more up-to-date."
2,"Software OK, but don't count on the rebate!",I purchased this s/w ahead of competiotors because of the available rebate. Wish I had not bothered! terms are not clear and no that easy to satisfy. Before you get fooled read the terms very carefuly and be prepared to wait a long time!
4,No rebate,"When I received my software I learned that the promised rebate had expires 4-15-2003. THIS IS JULY. It required a lot of updating. I don't mind that, but I think it was a bummer deal.You should know when these rebates expire before you say it is FREE plus shipping"
3,Have all day,"I purchased V7, had only one problem. I Could not download product update to v7.3.6. So I needed to turn off instant updater so that the software would not constantly try to download the update.Just recently I tried installing V8 to fix the constant download problem. However, V7 gave multitude of errors regarding uninstall before installing V8. Windows uninstall did nothing, mcafee sugests a forced uninstall, but for tech challenged people it is difficult. Took many hours to remove. Don't get rid of if you you all ready have it, but you are a new user try something else.The good-Easy to use, good viruscanEasy to install the first timeThe bad-stubborn to get rid offSupport staff needs more people to get ahead of problemsFirewall locks up internet"
1,Problems and Headaches,"I purchased McAfee Virus Scan a few months ago, and I have had computer problems ever since. A word to the wise, DO NOT install this product."
1,No Stars. Waste of Money and Time,"This program freezes my Win98 system. Trying to get tech help is another waste of time and money. Since it freezes my system, I can't get through to their website for help. Try calling the 972 area code phone number printed in the manual, and you get a message that their phone number has changed. Call the new number and have to listen to a long message directing you to the website, then you are given a 900 number to call, and told it will cost you $2.95 per minute for help. Called that number and you get a recording that the call can't be completed as dialled. I have removed it and am now ordering Norton. McAfee should be ashamed."
1,Not worth it...,"I had norton on my computer at home for the longest time, and never caught a virus or ad/spyware. When I came to college, they made us install McAfee on our computers, and it's also what's protecting the school network. Well, at least one virus gets through every month, prompting the whole schoolwide network to shut down, and while surfing the 'web, McAfee does a fairly good job of detecting ad/spyware--the problem is, it never seems to be able to clear or delete it and doesn't give me any options to get rid of it. Norton is more user-friendly, easier to use, and since installing it on my computer and uninstalling McAfee, I haven't had a single problem. Don't go with McAfee."
1,This product is trouble,Just try calling into any of their so called support desks...that should convince you not to by the prodcut. Maybe talk to a user who has tried to up date dat files...that will convice you not to buy the product. Or finally talk to some one (me) who has had their computer taken over and locked up for seveal days by their inept updates that can not even figure out compatability of versions. Believe me there are products with much better support and just as good functionality.
1,Pay more to cure viruses that get through!!,"I bought this & had nothing but problems. Computer freeze, computer crashes. Now to top it off, 2 viruses got through. McAfees response? If I purchase their upgrade they'll send me the cure. Why didnt the virus scan catch the virus??Plain & simple-this does not work.My ISP gave me a free cure on Klez & bigboy worm.I uninstalled McAfee & my computer is back to normal.McAfee support is more money hungry than customer oriented.More important,McAfee's products cannot be trusted,they do not work."
3,Be careful,It doesn't support email agents other than MS Outlook. So you are not protected when you are using other email agents.
1,This Software is [no good] And Support is bloody awful!,"McAfee has a cavalier attitude to upgrades. Upgrading from Version 6 to Version 7 was a nightmare. The software wouldn't install. Support was unintelligent and seemingly based on keywords. Staff absolutely cretinous. Finally after hacking around with the registry for weeks managed to get version 7 installed.However, settings aren't saved and errors reported every time machine rebooted.The best brains (sic) in McAfee have been looking at this problem for a month.To sum up McAfee and the support staff[are disappointing].VirusScan more like VirusScam."
1,Buy McAfee and get pestered with their own promo pop-ups,"Life with McAfee is hell. Eleven months after you buy the product, the software starts to generate pop-ups which advertise their promotions. These pop-ups are impossible to disable. Think of the worst spam you've ever had. This is worse. Don't touch this prodct."
1,Avoid this junk at all cost !,"Cons: You can't repair it, you can't remove it, and the tech support stinks.Pros: It looks pretty and takes up lots of disk space. The CD disk makes for a nice dog toy and the box is good for small bits of rubish and perhaps as another dog toy.Giving this a rating of one star is generous, infact I feel they should be giving me a few stars back in exchange for this worthless junk. Avoid this mess at all costs !!"
1,This software is TERRRIBLE!,I installed this program onto my computer according to the instructions. Immediately afterwards my computer stopped functioning. I could not use the internet. When I had 3 other windows open my computer showed all 3 simultaneously. They only give you 2 options for technical support: 1 is an email option which I could not use because I could not use the internet. ... I uninstalled the program and threw it away! Fortunately my computer is now back to normal.
2,Slower than the speed of blight,"Installed easily enough, and the firewall is always catching port scan attacks (are there really that many?)but McAfee has slowed things down so much on my computer I got to where I disable it most of the time. Having it enabled is about as bad as having a virus. If there are options for only disabling parts of the scan I can't find them (my old program made more sense that way), and their customer service, as you can read in other reviews, is pay-per-problem.End result...it works, and then becomes your newest problem."
1,Buyer beware!,"This program wreaks havoc with my Windows 98 system. It installs easy enough but turning the computer off loses the virus protection and unless you are on top of it you are left wide open you all! The program is severely flawed as is McAfee's idea of customer support. It is also not friendly to dial up connections.Yes, I wasted my money on this program. Please reconsider if you are thinking of making this purchase so you don't waste your's."
1,"It's awful, go get Norton","What a lousy product! I had problems installing VirusScan on my computer and had to redo it several times. After installing an reinstalling it frequently locks up my system, usually when I am in the middle of something. And forget about getting the rebate. I submitted mine 5 months ago and still haven't received it. When I call the rebate co they say they are waiting for McAfee to approve. When I call McAfee they say there can't find my record. Just go get Norton's AntiVirus."
1,if there were no stars this software would get it from me.,"A tragic desicion was my buying this garbage. It took a while to install, and afterwards simply interfered with everything I did on my PC. There even were times it left me flat and needed to be tinkered with in order to maintain Virus Protection.Customer support is a bad joke at McAfee.Why would someone make a poor product then charge you to ask them why? Well McAfee gets paid for answering questions, maybe that's their game.I removed this trash from my PC and I am fine again with another brand that works quietly in the back ground.So the rebates make this McAfee product free, big deal! It's a turkey, so buyer beware of the tempting rebate offers and stay away!"
2,Piece of Junk,Installed both VirusScan and the included firewall. Had to uninstall the firewall almost immediatley in order to use the internet. Performance of my computer declined until the last straw - had to reboot three times in less than 30 minutes. Uninstalled McAfee and have had no problems since. This is unfortunate as I've been using McAfee products since 1991.
1,"Poor Performance, Zero Customer Support","After installing this software, I began having trouble with updates. The updates would ""freeze up"", requiring a reboot. I tried many times to contact customer support, but received only one reply, suggesting that I consult the FAQ's on their home page. Apparently, many people were(are) having trouble with updates freezing up, as there is a whole section dedicated to that specific problem. All of the suggestions, (settings, configurations, etc.) failed to correct the problem. I finally ended up uninstalling the entire program. After uninstalling, I now find that my computer operates much faster and has fewer problems that it did with the McAfee installed. I am now using Norton Systemworks 2003 and it works great. Updates load instantly and smoothly. My advice is to buy the Norton!"
1,"Locked on install, no competent tech support","Locked Win98 up on install. After hours with Tech support,( Bubba in India didn't speak the english ) I had to format and re-install everything in my computer from scratch. ( Bubba thought it would be a good idea to edit my registry and ini files. That was the end of my machine. ) I then purchased and installed the major competitors product without a glitch. Bye bye McAfee, you won't ever sell me another loser program."
1,Bad Product. But REBATE SUCKS...,"There are many bad things about McAfee products which cannot be described within these 1000 words. Their earlier version, due to expiration after an year, so badly destroyed my O/S, that I had to reinstall the O/S. You cannot upgrade, unless you manually unintsall the older version. And, their new releases are more frequent than even Microsoft. Do not buy McAfee if you have dialup, imagine 13M download every 2 weeks. Their DAT releases have 40 odd files !!!(...)"
4,Much Better than Norton,"This has allowed my (Pentium III, Windows 98 v.2) to operate efficiently, which I couldn't say about Norton Antivirus and Systemworks. Just don't install the firewall."
2,Looks good on paper but didn't work for me,Auto run failed on two new cd's & I was given by best buy store Norton AV2003 that worked fine. See my children's review for more stuff.
2,No match for Norton,"I decided to try this software because I could get it for free (due to promotions) and Norton wanted much more for the subscription.Installation on Windows 2000 immediately presented a problem: the entire system hung after the installation. McAfee's support is useless, just their user's forum on their web site. Many users reported the same installation problem, but nobody has received any help from the company (I stopped watching the forum after a few weeks). To compromise, I had to turn off one of the major services on Windows 2000. Unless the company fixes this problem soon, I am gong back to Norton.This particular problem may not affect you if you don't use the product on Win2K, but being a software developer, I extrapolate my negative experience to the robustness of the McAfee's products in general. This is shame that the last line of defense like anti-viral software is crafted so unprofessionally."
1,Installation nightmare,"I purchased Version 7.0 to replace my V6.0 on my Windows XP system. I could not get 7.0 to install.An error message came up ""un-install older version of VirusScan"".I uninstalled version 6.0, but still got the error message.After looking on McAfee tech site I found that I needed to modify my Windows Registry (very, very dangerous).This software installation is way too difficult.Version 7.0 should have removed the older version in its installation operation, or at least over-written it.The Version 7.0 is now in my un-usable software bin.I think I'll try Nortons Anti Virus."
1,[Weak] Product,"Buying this product direct from McAfee, it installed what is virtually a virus, operating an undisclosed FTP server sending tons of undisclosed software out -- finally detected by using a Firewall. The program was even clearly labeled with a McAfee icon and my firewall identified its source. This continued even after uninstalling the whole product with the Windows installation manager. ..."
2,Don't count on any rebates,"The product is ok. However, don't plan on receiving any promised rebates. They just don't happen as they find different reasons not to comply. The sad part is that I would have bought the product no matter if a rebate was included or not - its just that they offer it, and never pay off."
1,Very disappointed,Their RuLaunch update product constantly crashes. I have never been able to update the virus definitions with it. Online support is confusing and useless. Be prepared to update the definitions manually.
1,FIREWALL HAS HUGE CONFLICTS WITH SBC DSL,I bought this software from McAfee and literally could not get the firewall to work...
1,NOTHING BUT GRIEF,I purchashed this software 5 months ago. I keep my computers OS updated reguarly. Newest security patches ect. Keep hard drive defrag ect. From the minute I loaded this product and it updated itself from their site the computer slowed to a crawl. Would refuse to shut down at times. Would love to freeze up when online. Yes it can scan files quickly for known viruses. But it you have it running while your working it's a dog. Found if I diabled it things were fine then enable and have it run it scan when I had free time to do somthing else. This has to be the worst piece of software that I have purchased in the 15 years I have owned a computer. I finally uninstalled it.
1,Takes Hours to Download,Took 4 attempts to download. This program kept getting stuck & the support staff's advice was to CTRL ALT DELETE and do the download from the beginning 4 times...There is no way to pick up where you left off on this download.Wait time for chat support (other than that you have to pay) was @ 10 minutes. My 80 year old grandmother is more computer savvy than the support staff.From start to finish the install time was well over 3 hours not 30 minutes.If you buy this1) don't make any plans2) expect to spend an entire evening aggravated
1,Screwed up my XP network settings,"What a pain it caused. I have a Dell 8200 with XP Pro and internet access through a LAN built around standard old NetGear RT314 gateway router hooked to a DSL modem. Nothing fancy. While installing McAfee VirusScan Home 7.0, I explicitly tell it NOT to install the Firewall because I know it could (mess) up my network settings in XP. And what does it do? It (messed) up my network settings anyway, and I could not get back online no matter how many times I tried to tweak the XP LAN settings. Luckily, the XP System Restore let me go back to before installation, and then everything was fine. I have since learned from other reviewers that, apparently, McAfee installs part of the firewall even when you tell it not to..."
2,stay away that about says it,"lack of support, by the way they have a forum, but guess what they don't treat you good at all in there. Was having computer problems for the longest time, windows would crash all the time and stuff. I really didnt know what was causing the problem. I did after I took mcafee Virusscan home edition off my computer. I rated this previously high, but then i found out what they are really like, and the program if it catches anything, probably it wont. Half the time vsmain didnt't respond, and then error messages all over. Listen to me and dont get, youll really regret if you buy this and then are disatified with it. Don't be stupid, and buy the program like i did."
2,"Convenience and good idea, but won't last long.","The first one I bought last for 7 days. I thought I was just bad luck, then made an exchange to a new one. The second one died in 9 days. They both have the same problem. When it dies, you can't turn it on, you can't even charge it. I returned the second one, and will wait for a little longer to try next batch from manufacturer."
4,Bobbsey twins,The book was one of series my daughter started and now she can't wait for the next book. The books have come in handy for school reports and essays.
2,V.3 Not a Charm,"Lots of songs, but only a few that were recognizable. Perhaps all the best tunes from the 80's were in V.1 and V.2."
4,Good Product,"Just the right size and sturdy. If you need under-shelf hooks, these are great; I hang multiple heavy coats on each tine and it doesn't wimper."
5,Great item!,"This worked perfectly in the spot I needed it to! Like another reviewer stated, why can't we find these at our local box stores!! Great item for adding a little extra storage to a closet!"
5,Hooks,These under shelf hook are just what I needed to finish a shelf I made for my wife for Christmas.
1,Never recieved it,"I have no idea what the condition of the shirt would be, as, after three promises, and, one delivery to ""a man"" in another city and statte, I have never recieved it. Then, I was promised a refund and a free shirt, for waiting 3 months..still nothing. Now, I dont really expect the ""free shirt"", but some apology is due. (Old Glory)"
5,Loved it so much I bought it twice!,"I bought one of these at Walgreens years ago, and loved it. The size is perfect, and it holds a lot. It has so many different compartments including brush holders. Also the fact that it zips up completely means you won't lose anything. I went online to find it again after my old one started to get shabby, it was around 8 years old. I was so happy to find it again. I use this case every day. It makes getting ready in the morning so simple, (no digging around in the drawer looking for what I need). And when you are done, just zip it up and put it in the cabinet. Also it is terrific for traveling. I highly recommend this planner."
1,"""Disappointing""","I must admit that I have never heard Ms. Collins before purchasing her CD to get the song ""There is Love"", but after listening to the CD, the first thing that poped into my mind was, ""Well there goes $22.95 down the drain"".""There is Love"" is a beautiful song but her version really missed the point. Oh well!"
5,Action-packed excitement with many strong characters.,"I am a lower elementary teacher (first through third grades) and each week we have storytime twice a week. Last year, I read this book to my students representing the ""mystery"" genre. Not only is this a wonderful read-aloud book for any age group, but it is a perfect mystery as every single chapter ends with everyone wanting to know what happens next. I had every student on the ""edge of their seats"" so to speak, which is a very challenging thing to do when you have such a diverse group.This year, when I started storytime, my students asked if I was going to read Deadly Waters again. I told them I'd get another in the series and read that to them. I just hope the others are even half as good. Just as a side-line: the characters are truly one of the best things about this book. Strong female and male characters that the students could really root for and understand."
4,READ DEADLY WATERS,The book Deadly Waters by Gloria Skurzznski and Alane Ferguson. First there were manatees getting sick and dieing. So the Landon family got called to Florida. Than Gordon came and stole Jack's camera. After they went to a restaurant they saw Gordon's boat. Jack's parents left to go to other places so Jack and Bridger went to go check out the boat. When they got to the boat Jack found his camera and took it. Than Gordon came and pulled out a gun than held it to Jack's waist.At the beginning of the book I thought I wouldn't like it but I did like it. There was a bit of action in the book. My favorite character in the book is Bridger because he wouldn't really give up. At the ending they solved why the manatees were getting sick.
4,A Gift for a child,I bought this book for my younger sister after she read it in matter of hours after checking it out at the library. She loves the book and has read a few more times since then.
2,You get what you pay for...pay more.,"Sure, it works, but I would rather just use it for playback and forget the recording part.The LED display doesn't show you nearly as much as with more expensive machines. You can't tell if you're recording SP or EP, for example. Just record something and see how fast goes on Rewind or Fast Forward.Another interesting ""feature"" is that when I hit the ""menu"" button on the remote, it doesn't work unless I hit ""play"" first. That's just plain weird.So, the lesson is that if you want a cheesy, minimal machine that's a pain to use, spend a little money. I which I had spent more and I will on my next VCR, if I buy another one."
1,Not Too Good,"I bought this machine for my mother so she could play tapes that I made for her. It seemed to work fairly well for that purpose, although some tapes I had made on another, older and more expensive, JVC machine would not play properly on this one, and one had to manually adjust the tracking to get a reasonably clear picture.Now, after minimal use for about two years, the machine eats tapes. It's worse than useless."
4,Good value for the money. Great for 2nd room or spare TV.,"Great unit. Reliable. Good picture and sound. Bought it to replace 10 year old [X] JVC Hi-Fi VCR that performed well under adverse condtiions. I have 2 of these - one is the source for VideoCD creation on my Mac. One's my primary VCR.Front panel buttons are hard to read in the dark - my only complaint! Otherwise, a good VCR for the money."
2,I'm very disappointed.,"I've had this machine for over 2 months and I still can't get it to work! It's not the machine's fault or the seller ... but without a remote, I can't get it to work. Then I asked a neighbor of mine that is much handier with technical machines and after he hooked it up, it still would not work. Maybe it's because my TV has to go through a DSL Converter box since I don't have cable. So far, it's just sitting there and I can't see any of my video tapes. What a disappointment!"
5,Little People by Dan Kennedy,"A well-written and interesting look at the human side of dwarfism, including dwarfism's repercussions to the individual and family members. Author Dan Kennedy has made a concerted effort to include as many facets of dwarfism as possible, things that others can never know without reading a book like this. This book is not just for little people themselves and families involved with dwarfism, but doctors and other healthcare professionals, teachers, therapists, and anyone interested in learning more about the strength of the human spirit. A very engaging and worthwhile book!"
2,Atmosphere,"I though the book was well written in horrific/grisly detail and I enjoyed it for the most part, but the continual reference to Frank's three personalities was a bit tedious. Yah, I get it, there's an inner struggle."
5,One Great Book,"I picked this up in the bookstore because I liked the cover. I was not disappointed with the contents either. Someone else here mentioned this book reading like a Dean Koontz book. They're right, it does. It reminds me of some of his earlier work. If Laimo's drive and talent takes him in the same direction as Koontz, we might very well see him on the bestseller lists in the years to come. I'm looking forward to his next book.If you like Police Procedurals with a touch of the supernatural, then get this book. It's great!!"
4,Actually 4 1/2 stars....,Laimo has debuted with a fast-paced read that I finished in less than 24 hours.Laimo's style is similar to Dean Koontz and is great stuff. He writes like a bat out of hell and is very good at characterization and setting the plot up very nicely. He knows how to scare and adds a touch of humor to this fascinating tale.The ending seems to set this up like a series in the making. This book reminded me of the X-files series on Fox. This would make an interesting movie.
3,"close, but no cigar","When I first started reading this novel, I didn't have high hopes for it, as the writing was awkward and needed a rewrite or three to get just the right effect. However, the plot was sufficiently novel to keep me reading. Though the story really didn't begin to take off until halfway through, I stuck with it, and found that he brought all the elements together quite nicely. It's too bad he didn't take more time to develop the characters or the, um,*atmosphere*-- a good deal more of Lovecraft or, better yet, William Burroughs would have made this novel a lot more memorable. Better than most, but not worth cancelling any appointments or taking the phone off the hook for."
3,"A fine and educational book, but completely overlooking","This book completely overlooks the very constitutional perogrative, that the power to change the clear meaning of the constitution lies with We The People, and nowhere else.I realize that making a case for fundamentalism is asking for some ugly reversions to earlier interpretations that our society no longer accepts -- but it is WE who should change the text of the constitution to realign it with the ""consent of the governed"". This is our duty, and it has been taken away from us. Far reaching judicial interpretations -- most of which we all agree with and consent to -- have lulled us asleep, and allowed unelected judges to rewrite the clear meaning of constitutional law.It was never their job to do this, it was ours all along. We must reclaim it."
3,Same old stuff,"I borrowed it from the library, thinking I might want to buy it. I like films that teach, so I thought the premise might be interesting. I wanted a GOOD script, a solid connection between characters (I try to overlook a mediocre script if the acting is good enough - it wasn't) and this film just didn't have enough sparkle or holiday charm. So I give it two and a half stars because it was okay to see once - alone."
4,Tough Shannon at her best !,Shannon Doherty plays a tough cynical jewel thief who gets stuck minding her niece and nephew during Christmas season. Shannon is great in the role- funny-likeable and completely believeable as a jewel thief. I really enjoyed this one- you will too.
3,Don't waste your money.,"This is an ok Christmas story but not worth the $ 2.99 I paid for it, save your money for A Christmas Romance with Olivia Newton John, A Home by Christmas, Christmas List, A Season of Miracles, or Snow Globe."
4,BE QUIET NOW,I CHOSE THE RATING BECAUSE I DO LIKE THE MOVIE AND THE CAST IS GREAT ESPECIALLY SHANNON DOUGHTERY. I LIKE WATCHING CERTAIN X'MAS MOVIES BECAUSE THEY ARE FUNNY TALENTED AND GREAT CAST. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LIKE CHRISTMAS
2,not what i expected,I bought the book based on the cover. I thought I would also get new decorating ideas but I was wrong. The cookie recipes are just ok.
1,don't waste your money,"Not a good book. I actually haven't tried one recipe in this book, because none of them sounded good. I like the cover though!"
5,Hitting the Suite Spot,"The only thing wrong with this book is that more CEOs don't read it. Ross Dawson captures and communicates the strategic and tactical imperatives to help any organization (or person) build lasting and successful client relationships. It is akin to something you always knew but didn't know how to say. Ross does all the work and makes it seem easy. From placing value on your services (do you want to be a commodity or a partner) to implementing collaborative technologies, Ross tells it like it is, in a way that even the most static organization can understand and embrace. A must read for anyone who wants to survive in today's marketplace. Great for marketing communications professionals in particular (at advertisers or at agencies).Tony Keevan<html><div style='background-color:'><DIV class=RTE></DIV><DIV><A href=""http://www.CSquaredFocus.com"">www.CSquaredFocus.com</A></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV> </DIV></div><hr> <a href=""http://g.msn.com/8HMBENUS/2755??PS=47575"""
3,"Good information, excellent photos, flimsy binding.","Bought this book along with Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, also by David Reynolds. The pages are falling out of both books. I've had this problem with a few DK books, even the children's books. The older DK books are more sturdy. I give this item only 3 stars, and only because of the content. A book with missing pages doesn't get 5 stars."
5,good reading material,"the villian was too easy to kill.villian needs too last as long as darth vader& have stronger powers.also needs female jedi! focus more on the battle of good & evil,like have good on one side of battle line & vise/versa. make it known who they are.fem. jedi needs to be a strong leader."
4,A Great Gift,"I bought this book for my nine-year-old son, but I had a quick peek first! As expected, the very next day I found the living room floor carpeted with drawings and diagrams he'd based on the illustrations. My only complaint would be that the book was a little thinner than I had expected, and personally, I'd have given the actors single pages and put the pod racers on the double-page spreads. I was particularly disappointed not to find a cut-away of the Radon-Ultzer engines - well, there's always the Incredible Cross-Sections book, I suppose!"
2,it fell apart!,"We bought this for our 6 year-old son for Christmas and I do have to say that he LOVED it. However, after about 3 weeks the binding just totally came apart!! I know he didn't abuse it because the rest of the book really looks brand new. The pages are all coming out. He was so disappointed and I am too, I'd expect much more from DK publishing."
2,"Nice, but better to borrow it from someone or library","I bought this nice book, taht outlines everythign in the movie, from all the nitty gritty things you dont' even pay attention to. It has some nice pictures, but really, its not worth the 20 bukcs you end up paying, cause you read it once, you''ll never touch it again."
2,this toy is boring,i went out and got Obi wan because i had Zam and i wanted to act out the scene in Coruscant but when i opened him i was upset the figure shows no ressemblance to Ewan McGregger for one his hair is ginger in the film not blond and his hand with the magnet looks as if he has got a tumor there i am begging hasbro to bring out a decent aotc Obi wan
3,GO OBI-WAN KENOBI !,"THIS IS THE FIRST STAR WARS FIGURE I GOT. I'M NOT OBI-WANS BIGGEST FAN, BUT I LIKE IT. THE LIGHTSABER BLADE BENT AT THE PART WERE IT ATACHES TO THE HANDLE. THAT WAS A REAL BUMMER TO ME BECAUSE I WAS HAVING SUCH FUN. IF IT WASN'T BENT, I'D HAVE THE TIME OF MY LIFE."
4,obi-wan rules,"i got this figure when i got jango fett kamino escape and i opened it and play with it. there are two problems though. one, he is a little small and two, his lightsaber blade comes off too easily. but overall a good figure. he is rare."
3,"Honey, I Shrunk Obi-Wan...and dyed his hair...","This toy is pretty cool, but has a few defectrs to it. Such as he is shorter than other figures like Anikan, or Dooku, only taller then Boba Fett of Yoda. Plue, the magnet in his hand does not hang on to the droid very well, so if you try to stand him p with the droid in his hand, he will probably fall over, and the droid hangs lopsided. Also, his right hand looks goofy holding the lightsaber, like he's magically floating it in the air. Plus the lightsaber blade falls out of its handle eaisly, andhis hair is too blonde, needs to be more reddish-ginger colored. And his expression makes it look like he got shot in the foot. All in all, a fairly decent toy, but I'd eccomend you instead buy either Jango Fett Kamino Escape or final Battle, Count dooku, and Anakin Skywalker Hangar Duel."
3,Obi-wan and ASN droid,"While looking for cool Star Wars action figures, I found this pair. It looked really good (especially the droid), so, of course, I bought it. It's okay, but the problem is that Obi-wan's arms and legs are not jointed at the knees, elbows,or at the bases of the legs. All you can move is his head, his waist, and his shoulders. The droid is cool. I would get a different Obi-wan, unless you really like the droid."
3,Dissapointing,"After playing FIFA '07 for Xbox, I decided to buy the 360 version. Let me just say that it was a BAD DECISION. For starters, the gameplay is lacking (it is nearly impossible to switch players). There is also no way to make your own team."
2,Shiny with no substance,"If gaming graphic is what you looking, fifa 07 on the xbox 360 is the game for you. The game look great, the player model are simply unbelievable but once you pass graphic there nothing there. The gameplay is horrific, commentary should have been left out. The game is very dull,I tried playing on XBL but it didn't help, there was no excitement playing this game at all just frustration. I got so frustrated playing this game that I almost broke my wireless controller. I am so glad that I rented this game before I actuallybrought it. If just want to stare at the player model definitely buy this butif you actually want to play it and have fun doing so try something else."
4,This game has some quirks but not bad!!,The game play is a little quirky. But the graphics are good. Also the manager mode is pretty cool. All in all a decent game for soccer fans but not as good as Winning Eleven.
4,Great Game but still needs improvements.,"This is the best FIFA game so far. Every year it gets better. The graphics for '07 were much better than before and so was the game play (the smoothness movements of the players). The only thing i didn't like about it was the few leagues it had, and i thought some of the players skills were either overrated or underrated. This game is very fun but it still needs improvements."
1,Do not pay for EA's experiment,"This game is terrible. I rarely write comments on amazon but I just hope before you spend 60 dollars on this game (50 on amazon)please re-consider. You are much better off finding one of the many pre-played games being sold by people who have had the same experience as me. My fellow reviewers at amazon have done an excellent job of explaining why not to buy this game so I will not go into details. For people who have followed the franchise they will be VERY disappointed by the gameplay and the lack of any flexibility over your teams and strategies which gets very frustrating. For casual gamers and new-comers the game provides great eye candy but by no way are you playing the best football simulation out there. Rather save your money and buy PES or play the vintage FIFA games from EA. If for any reason you really absolutely need to spend your money and play this game, go the pre-played way."
2,Titanic Short-changed,"The European editors of this fine 1980 TV production eliminated much of the original 150 minute drama which made the fate of the Titanic a real cliff-hanger. Missing in this DVD rendering are all the good radio room scenes (including the Marconi sparkgap transmitter sending ""SOS CQD"" in the TV production's opening titles) as well as the question of the nearby Californian's failing to identify the Titanic's rockets, and its tragic absence of a radio operator who went off watch at midnight fifteen minutes before the Titanic's first SOS went out. Unlike ""A Night to Remember"" (which remains the most accurate and compelling version of the tragedy), this Titanic story (much like James Cameron's slosher) focuses on the horror of people of all classes going to watery dooms. Of the eight Titanic versions I've seen, including the 1943 Nazi Germany one, S.O.S. Titanic ranks, along with its namesake, on the very bottom."
2,DONT WASTE TIME,"ENGLISHDONT WASTE YOUR TIME, THIS BOOK NO HAVE MORE INFORMATION THAT THE MANUAL OF THE PIC BASIC, AND THE PROJECTS ARE TOO BASICS,ESPAÑOLNO PIERDAN EL TIEMPO, ESTE LIBRO ES MALO, SOLO COPIARON EL MANUAL Y NO AGREGARON NINGUN TIPO DE INFORMACIÓN REALMENTE UTIL, ES DAMASIADO BASICO"
1,Cheap Thrill? Not even...,"This is the work of a bitter misanthrope. Sugar's jokes are predictable and his writing style is stale. Try ""When Pride Still Mattered"" for a good book on football."
2,Jealousy promotes hatered,"Who elected The Dallas Cowboys 'America's Team' anyway? It was The NFL. The original film titled ""America's Team"" was produced in 1979. There was also a video produced in 1997 titled ""America's Team' Forever"". This was the 1997 Dallas Cowboy team video. Throughout Mr. Sugar's book it was clear that his writings were driven by jealousy; Jealousy of the one and only 'America's Team'."
5,This is a well informed and organized book.,I feel that Mr. Sugar has done what a lot of long time fans have been wanting to do. Write a book informing the General public of what the Cowboys are all about. They have been around with an attitude for long enough. Mr. Sugar has compiled essays laying out specific excusses to hate the Cowboys. There are a couple of them that are for the cowboys. This is a well balanced book. It is suggested reading for all fans who love to hate the worst team ever.
4,this toy is wicked,This was my second aotc figure i picked up and i have to say its excellent the clawdite face that you can put on her looks really good and the quickdraw action works surprisingly well. The only thing i don't like is when you stand her up she's wonky but thats just a minor problem.
4,"Not for the very begginers, but a great aid for admins.","I got this book after some experience with WNT4.0, when I was heading for my cert. It's a very good technical book, very concise and does not waste pages repeating itself hundreds of times. I think it's great as a certification aid and also as a reference book, esentially for admins and field techs in a networked WNT4 environment."
4,"Good content,so so sound quality.","Wow this cd is great when it comes to hearing real accounts of people discussing what they just saw.these people see ufos.Yes indeed they see a glow in the sky really big.Much more substantial than any plane,jet,or balloon.Yes folks this is the rare an authentic cd of actual 911 call and police radio disscussions of the ufo they are seeing at the moment they are seeing it.The sound quality wasn't top rate but certainly tolerable,considering what this is a recording of.Also the price is reasonable.I believe they saw a real ufo,afterall I see real ufos in my backyard all the time.This cd of the trumble county 911 dispatch calls is more proof that our space brothers are preparing us for something really enormous and energy composed in the extreme."
3,I liked the product. It seemed like you ...,I liked the product. It seemed like you could use less than a regular shaving cream. It went on very smooth and left my skin soft. The scent was not overpowering either. There really wasn't anything that I disliked about this product.
3,ok,The show is great it just shock me these where not the season that all the other cast members was not in that we no that are in the 1980's on up shows but good show
4,vintage 1979 last of the summer wine,"I never watch these British Comedy before until I was at my MOM's and she really likes these shows after watching them I was hook on them.They are shows that just make you laugh,and MOM and I watch them together and she is ninety one years old with deminta and this is what makes her laugh.I'll will buy all of them for her and I."
5,excellent!,This is an excellent program. I am now buying them and sharing them with my family. I highly recommend to others
2,Last Of The Summer Wine,Very few if any new episodes Most shows are the same as seen in earlier releases. With thirty plus years of shows it seems as if they would not have to repeat earlier releases
2,tiresome name dropper,"There are so many memoirs of expatriats who move to Paris and feel the need to write about their experiences. I am sorry, but this--for me--did not work. While John Baxter may be a very nice man, he comes off as an insufferable name dropper that must reveal to the poor reader his sexual exploits with far too much personal detail. I found this book barely readable and empty. Two books that come to mind (and there are many others) that I can recommend for reading on the subject are Paris to the Moon by Adam Gopnik and The Sweet Life in Paris by David Lebovitz. They are very different from each other: the former is told by a family man who is a respected editor (New Yorker) who does what many of us only dream of doing: moving to Paris for a year or two. His essays are very well done and enjoyable. David Lebovitz is a talented baker and ice cream maker who has several good cookbooks under his belt. His memoir is--given my experience in Paris--spot on and hilarious."
4,We'll Always Have Paris: Sex and Love in the City of Light,I really enjoyed the book as it showed a part of Paris I was unfamiliar with. It also gave some ideas on places that I would like to visit the next time I am there.
3,Good blend of historical and personal accounts,This was a fun read. There are parts that were a bit dry and boring but overall I enjoyed it. I thought it was really interesting how the author weaved in historical events with his actual experiences in the City of Lights.
2,rather pointless,"The author can't decide whether he wants to write an erotic history or the tale of his own romance. Doing both doesn't work in this book, which has no frame of reference or even a reliable sequence of events.The other major flaw of the book is ots reliance on the sex lives of the Surrealists- as if Parisian sexual histroy is limited to these odd ducks.Not particularly inspiring or evocative."
3,Good enough,The used book was in good enough condition to meet the requirements of my doctor's instructions that I read it.
2,"Just ""OK"" for newborns","I bought these diapers for my newborn daughter because that is what everyone told me to purchase, and I have returned every package except the first one I opened. I have preferred Pampers because they feel more cloth-like, seem to fit my daughter's body shape better, and she did not develop diaper rash like she did with the Huggies. Perhaps Pampers breathe better than Huggies? I'm not sure - but you stick with what works for your kid - and for mine, it's Pampers all the way!"
1,not obsorobet,i bought dese dipers for my baby born doll since she peas alot.the pea would come out of the diper it wets my friends when they would carry her.it would wet me.when i bought pampers they wher great.noleaks. it did not wet my friends.
1,Tired of WASTING your Money!!!!!Don't Buy These....,"We Rec'd Pamper Swadlers and Huggies Newborn as shower gifts. We used the pampers the first two weeks and they held up to our expectations. Week three we used the Huggies newborn we rec'd and about every other diaper leaks, also noticed that the velcro tabs don't hold, leaks urine and defication around the legs. Ever notice how huggies is always giving samples out and also giving coupons out like mad. Makes you think that they know they have a problem with their products and trying every marketing way to sell HUGGIES, we will be returning all the Huggies we have now to exchange them for pampers or another brand."
2,L-E-A-K-Y,"I got a bunch of these from the hospital after I had my son. At a skinny 6 lbs., 13 oz., they fit perfectly as the other brand (Pampers Swaddlers) I had at home were for babies who were at least 8 lbs. and seemed to swallow him whole. Fast forward 2 weeks later. I pick up my son and notice his left side (he had learned to turn over on his side during his sleep) was very moist. At first, I thought he was sweating since I had turned down the A/C. I'm a first-time mom. What did I know? Since newborn urine has no smell, I never thought he could be leaking. He was only around 7 and a half pounds by now. A week later, he's sleeping in the bassinet part of his stroller. I pick him up and, once again a wet spot not only on his clothes, but on the bassinet sheet as well. Needless to say, I whipped out the Swaddlers and posted the Huggies on Freecycle. We've been dry ever since.I gave it 2 stars since they do have a nice fit."
3,Can't register for this?,"Tried to add Huggies Newborn ro my Baby Registry, but the only option I get is to add it to a Wedding Registry. Does this make sense?"
1,Very slow,"This was ordered on July 21, today is Aug 10 and still now merchandise. You said it was due to ship by Aug 13, now it is changed to Aug 19 - Sept 13. My grandchild is due any day now, hope he can still wear them come Sept. ????? So much for usually shippes with in 24 hours!!"
4,A good intro to Hemingway,"James Mellow should be applauded for the way he harmonizes Hemingway's stories and Hemingway's life. After all, Hemingway did write with a highly autobiographical slant, and by reading his fiction, one is able to travel alongside the famous writer as, for example, he travels with his father to the Indian Camp, as he lies wounded in an Italian hospital, as he leans on the rail of the bullfight arena and watches horses get gored by bulls, etc, etc. I took my time reading this massive biography, and, simultaneously, I read each of Hemingway's stories (in the First Forty-nine) as I encountered them in the bio. This dual-reading allowed greater understanding of Hemingway the man and greater appreciation for Hemingway the writer. Compared to Kenneth Lynn's biography, Mellow's objective treatment is rather dull, but memorable overall. Read the last paragraph and enjoy the beauty of the language."
3,OK STARTER KIT ON HEMINGWAY - WITH RESERVATIONS,"I enjoyed this work. The author did give a different slant to Hemingway the man, and indeed, the works of Hemingway. I cannot say for a second that I agreed with the author much over 25 percent of the time, but hey, Mellow has his opinion, I have mine. I did feel that Mellow beat the ""gay"" thing into the ground (as like in ""Who Cares?"") and did feel that the author did not have a good grasp of the works of his subject, i.e. Hemingway and his writing. Again though, it was nice getting another opinion and did leave me with some food for thought. This in no way compares with the work of Carlos Baker and his ilk, but, again, gives us just another view...always a nice thing. I do hope though, that the reader of this work reads some other biographies on Hemingway and do hope they actually read some of Hemingways work. On the other hand, I am a big Hemingway fan and my view, I am sure, is a bit slanted."
1,quite possibly the worst thing I've ever tried to read,"I had a great interest in learning more about Hemingway. The home in Key West, the love of fishing, the adventures -- someone so notable must surely have stories to captivate a willing reader.This book was an effort to get through the first 200 pages, and when I slowed down to a painful page a day, I had to call it quits.The author attempts to take people and events from Hemingway's life and piece together who they ended up as in Hemingway's writings. And......well, that's pretty much it. I felt compelled to write a review to warn others -- it's just that bad.I closed the book well before the last page bored and unmoved."
5,I loved it!!,"I enjoyed Crossing Jhordan's River immensely. I have a childhood friend experiencing the same problems Jhordan experienced. I happened to be speaking with him about the book I was reading and hadn't realized he was going through the same issues with his new wife, how coincidental. He has since purchased the book and I'm waiting on his phone call to see if he has come to grips with his situation as Jhordan had done. GOOD JOB KENDRA!!"
3,too mant references,"I usually enjoy reading Paglia but thought this condensed Art History effort was more a bibliography than an enlightening effort. It did keep me busy, recording references to other works so I could read them. She spent too much time talking about images most readers are unfamiliar with so very hard to stay with her thought process. Kind of like name-dropping contemporary work."
2,couldn't even finish it,"It isn't often that I don't read a book all the way through... unless of course it's utter rubbish. I wouldn't peg Paglia's book of essays as that, but i would approach it with trepidation. It wasn't that I didn't agree with most of her rantings (although I didn't), it was the way they were written. Buried in a heap of reference after reference, it was almost impossible to trudge through most of what she said, without feeling the need to research every other sentence. Her essays on date rape were linguistically digestable, although her ideas were fairly offensive, not to mention, reading this work in 2001 (It came out in the early 90's) makes a lot of her opinions read as outdated. At first I liked it, she made me angry and it was fun to wage an inner debate... but later on... I mean, do we really want to read her lesson plan for a class she once taught... all 50 pages of it? Do you get the idea? A lot of it seemed like her own mental masturbation. Proceed with caution."
1,"oh, boo hoo","After reading through this collection of essays I had to throw it against the wall out of utter frustration. Although Ms. Paglia's neo-feminist approach can be quite refreshing and, yes, amusing at times it ain't happening here. I don't want to dismiss the points that she attempts to make, but, God, could she keep her huge phallic ego out of everything? Do I need to be constantly reminded that she is an Italian-American and a scholar? Well, I figured that if she is a professor and has a book of her essays published she must be. So what? The topics are purely approached with subjectivity and lack of depth. Not so scholarly."
1,"blunt language, banal conception","Paglia enjoys being irreverent and un P.C. However, her sharp pronouncements are not qualified by either scholarship or personal experience. Sass is the propellant for her arguments. Her examinations of various topics from rape to the avant garde are cursory. So her conclusions are simplistic, sensational, and ultimately very irresponsible."
4,Paglia the Thinker,This book is for the real Paglia fan. I'd reccomend reading this book in chunks not straight through. I wonder if she is ADD? Or maybe on the autism spectrum? Her thoughts seem to explode onto the page.
2,Camille can do better,"While she deserves her fame, there have been two negative effects from it. One is that her immense ego has gotten even bigger. The other is that she now wants us to hear her opinion on every topic under the sun. Compared to the insights of Sexual Personae, this book is fluff. Yes, there are some interesting things here, but nothing like the sustained analysis of her first book. There's a contradiction in her work. While she is always criticizing the semioticians and the post-structuralists, in a sense they made her work possible. Before them, pop culture was not a fit subject for serious intellectual study. You don't see her mentor Harold Bloom talking about the Rolling Stones. She can write intelligently about pop culture when she puts her mind to it, which is what I'm hoping Sexual Personae Volume Two will be about. Unless you're a big fan, skip this book and wait for that one"
2,Notice,"Don't fret that this book is out of print. Actually, it's included in the Von Bek omnibus currently available from White Wolf. But don't bother. This is, in my opinion, the worst book Moorcock has written to date. A shame, too, as it is the sequel to The War Hound and the World's Pain (also included in the Von Bek omnibus), which I consider to be not only one of Moorcock's best, but also one of the best works ever written in the genre. City in the Autumn Stars combines all the tedious boredom of a Victorian novel with the frustration of trying to relate to a main character who has absolutely no self-determination. The result is a thoroughly unpleasant experience that seems like picking over the rotting carcass of the previous novel in the series; a recognizable form, but with none of the juice and a decidedly nasty flavor."
3,A difficult read...,"...for one very simple reason--it's too damned long, and not very satisfying. None of the characters are at all sympathetic (quite the opposite in ""The War Hound and the World's Pain,"" as I liked Ulrich von Bek very much), save Lucifer himself...sympathy for the Devil, you say? Maybe. I also gotbored rather quickly with Manfred von Bek's wanderings about the Deeper City; I really think Moorcock could have pared back quite a few of the details here, and the narrative would have improved immeasurably."
3,Super Reader,"The Von Bek family is still involved with that whole Heaven and Hell thing. This time it is one of the descendants, named Manfred.The French Revolution doesn't suit Von Bek, so he leaves, quickly. Going to Mirenberg, he gets involved with a Duchess, and an Angel?"
5,Book with good lessons,"I originally skipped the lessons in this book, in favor of just playing all of the tabbed out studies. Big mistake! The lessons are very well graded, and move at a comfortable pace (the studies kind of throw you in to the thick of things, a bit overwhelming for a beginner). As a teacher, I have used this book to help students out with their technique, performance, and theory.The actual blues that it does teach is very much on the cliche side of things, but the lessons will have a universal appeal towards other types of music, especially as far as the theory goes. Because of this I have to grade this book with 5 stars, because it is really one of the best in this regard, and with a good mix of learning and playing, it is a great choice for learning and understanding the guitar.Daniel Page, Guitar Instruction"
4,Very solid instruction for the blues,"This is probably the best introductory book I have managed to find for electric blues. The tunes are great and sound good. The performances are inspiring, well graded and fun to play along with. However what distinguishes this book is the lesson material. Each chapter contains a different topic or two to practice, including pentatonic scales, chord changes, intervals and so on. They are set out well, you just have to proactice them!Areas where it could be improved are to have fingerings on the study tunes and separate backing tracks on the CD. I have to admit though that this book is backed up by a great web site and these issues are being addressed. Make that four and a half stars."
4,Good Teaching Format,I really like the way the material of blues guitar is presented in this book. The best thing about the book is that it first teaches a critical part of blues guitar and then give you a song in so you actually see what you learned in action. I think this is the best way to teach material because it keeps the player interested. There is a wealth of info for beginners but anyone should buy this book.
5,Very accessible,This instruction book provides a path for the frustrated adult beginner to advance on her own. The book starts with easy concepts and moves forward through generally increasingly difficult exersizes. There are no real songs in this book. It's an instruction manual.The landscape is lttered with instruction books that are quite useless. This one is refreshingly useful.You need to be able to play typical cowboy chords and easy bar chords before starting the book.
5,Excellent Method Book. For Intermediate + Players,"This book is not really a beginner's book. Some of the licks require a dexterity level beyond what a beginner would be expected to do. This is one of the few books with a method presented in a logical format as opposed to a caffeteria style approach leaving you asking questions. For the most benefit, you should do the following:1. Get this book as well as the ""more Blues You Can Use"".2. Also get ""Complete Rhythm Guitar Guide for Blues Bands"" by Larry McCabe.3. Listen to the Rolling Stones' Beggar's Banquet and Exile on Main Street CDs.4. Listen to Kenny Burell's ""Midnight Blue"" CD over and over."
5,Stellar learnings on blues rock!,"I have only been playing guitar for about a year so am still entry level. I knew the major chords and some others before picking up this great book. I would say it is NOT a raw beginner's book as others have said but it is an entry-level book for those who have at least tinkered with the guitar for a couple of months. The content is very easy to comprehend and simply takes some practice to master. It is laid out perfectly and the instructions couldn't be more straight forward...just do what Mr. Ganapes says and you'll be on your way! This is definitely a blues rock course though and not traditional acoustic blues. I play it on my acoustic (as well as the electric) and it sounds great, but not traditional. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in playing blues rock music on guitar!"
5,Excellent Blues Intro,"This book and cd cover a variety of blues styles. John Ganapes emphisises learning the blues pattern, and he gives many excercises to really burn the patterns in memory. He gives a good variety of coards (7ths, 9ths, etc.), and he gives differnt fingerings to help you make smooth transitions. Many of the songs are slow and fast tempo on the CD. I like the different tempos because it helps you to play with feeling at a slow and fast tempo(if you decide to use the tracks to help you develope your from the heart playing[this is what the blues is all about -right?]). This book should be used with ""More Blues You Can Use"" to get all John Ganapes wants to teach."
2,Just ok.,"Not what I expected. Doesn't look as nice as pictured. The closure was just a felt strip with velcro on the end of it (no all around zipper). And I really wouldn't call it a ""large traveller"". I guess it serves it's purpose, just wish the finishes were a bit nicer."
3,Other figures are better,"I purchased this figure based largely on the reviews. But compared to other figures I own, this was a disappointment.CONS:1. It is slightly difficult (but not impossible) to assemble. It does not seem like much thought was put into this action figure.2. It has only minor detailing. Overall it is dark, plain, and has a very ""plastic"" look and feel.3. It does not stand well. It will stand on its own, but It is top heavy and will take some adjusting. I higly recommend using a plastic action figure stand for this guy.PROS:1. It was a decent action character in the movie.2. He has a blast apart feature and shoots a missle from his arm. Very good if you intend to actually play with this figure.3. Its a Star Wars Episode II figure!OVERALL: If you haven't purchased some of the other figures (like Dexter Jettster, Yoda, or Taun We) get them first. This is not one of the better figures."
5,This droid is suh-weeeeeeet!!,"After seeing this figure in huge numbers everywhere I go, I decided to use my ""Gift Card"" I got for my birthday on a Super Battle Droid, a Geonosian, and Kit Fisto. My favorite figure that I got with my card was this figure. It looks exactly like the droids from the movie and is so awesome with its blow-apart feature which is possible by a button on the back. Some may complain that it is a little difficult to reassemble, but with a little patience, it can be reassembled in less than 10 seconds if you lay the pieces and assemble it on a hard surface. The canon arm with the fireable projectile is great, too, as it shoots pretty far. Also included is a second breastplate that is battle damaged and can also hold a little blast effect on the right. This figure is very detailed and very poseable, which is very important to me. I will have to go get a few more, and I recommend that you should, too."
4,OK for kids,"Software a little confusing, but overall a good MP3 player. My granddaughter is really enjoying it."
4,pretty good for something that isn't an ipod,"i asked my fiance for our first chirstmas if he could get me something that will hold all of my cds. well he didn't like ipod that much and bought me this one and himself a blue one so we matched. i like it alot, the battery last pretty long for me, its small and light. i got water some how on it and it didn't get ruined, also i have the 512mb and i have over 170 songs on it. the down fall is if i didn't use his computer it would delete all the songs i already downloaded so i now have to use my computer and borrow cds of friends to download not just pop it in and down load. but i like it its pretty good for not being an ipod."
5,Perfect MP3 player,This Mp 3 player is great... no doubt about it. It easy to use and has a cool screen. Sounds better than any stereo I've heard before. A little over $100 is a bargain!.
1,NWE 505 a questionable package,"I purchased this item to listen to FM radio or music while running. The wire for the ear buds are incredibly short, and so I clipped the unit to the collar of my tee shirt. Sweat got on the case and the thing quit working within 30 minutes.This seemed like a fluke, since the device seems to be made for working out, so I returned it to Sony. At first Sony refused to repair or replace the unit, and wanted to refund the purchase price. I refused and they shipped another unit, which quit working in a similarly short period of time under similar circumstances.At this point I gave up. Visiting my local Radio Shack later for another reason, I found that an FM radio with a two gig MP3 player (the NWE 505 has 512M) was available for about $40, cheaper than the NWE 505, without waiting for delivery. Works great, without the hassle of the Sony MP3 software."
5,Great MP3 player,I received this mp3 player as a gift and I'd have to say that I'm very pleased with it. It is super easy to use. It is simple to put songs onto and sort. Plus the battery life is great. It's nice and small about the size of a lighter. The FM tuner comes in very good. At my work I had a hard time getting in stations but this little player gets even the ones I didn't even think could.
5,WOW,"I love the NW-E505. I used it at work and a co-worker thought I had lost my mind because I was bopping my head and he couldn't see the ear phones or the player (cause it's so small). It's great for the gym, which is why I bought it. Very easy to use software included. Best of all IT'S PINK! I'm not even close to maxing out the # of songs it holds. Great for the price, I'm very pleased."
4,"Great player, really bad software","This player is great. Forget about the iPod Shuffle. This has a much longer battery life, an fm tuner, and an incredible OELD screen. A previous reviewer said that it doesn't support mp3. Well they are wrong. I only use mp3s on it.The only down side is the terrible Sonicstage software that you use with it. This is the worst software I have ever used. Thankfully there is an alternative. Get MP3 File Manager. It is drag and drop and works great.(...)"
2,Defective technology ruins great performances,"Like several other reviewers, I was frustrated by the pops and skips in the first disc. The second disc had no problems. I liked everything about the performances, including the interviews with Kurt Mazur and his views about this music. The performances were deeply satisfying and played with great emotion by the orchestra. It is a shame the manufacturer didn't control the quality of the product better before releasing it for sale. I could not return my DVDs because they were purchased too long ago and was prepared to order another set, but apparently Kultur is still the selling defective ones. Without a change in cover, how can one know if the problem has been corrected?"
2,music lover in MD,"The two stars are for the quality of the disc, not the performance. I too purchased the DVD. Performance is superb, but the picture has problems with popping noises and jumps. I contacted KULTUR. They knewabout the problem. It was in the transfer to the disc. They said they are fixing it and will reissue the DVD. How will anyone know if the DVD purchased at a future date has the problem fixed???I sent mine back and hope to eventually purchase it at a future date."
3,Good buy Brahms,All four symphonies for a reasonable price! Pretty good commentary too. Unfortunately the visual quality is no more than adquate.
1,Not well written,Author jumps around and was very little continuity. It is just a jumbled mess. I don't understand how it was ever published.
3,Hindsight is 20/20,"The book is filled with some great historical accounts of the secret service. I especially liked reading about the origins of the agency and it's evolution.I did not like the arm chair quarterback, hindsight being 20/20 attitude of the author. He consistently referred to assasination attempts as ""failures"" by the USSS. While their may have been mistakes made, no operation is executed perfectly.And he spent way too much time on the Kennedy asassination. The author is a real conspiracy theorist.Overall, it seems the author has a poor opinion of the USSS."
5,excellent,The book was just as it was presented - A good choice andI will recommend it. Good subject matter.
1,2 cans in a row leaked,"I had 2 cans in a row explode. The first time it happened, I thought it might have been caused by the altitude change during a recent ski trip. But the second time it happened, the can never left my house. No, I didn't shake the can or knock it around. I just got a little every morning and then put it back under the sink. I'll try another brand instead. I don't want to have to clean up any more messes."
3,Not impressive,"I used to use this in past and since switched Gillette. Currently using Gillette comfort advantage shaving gel, and will try theGillette Fusion Hydra Gel Shave Gel, Moisturizing, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)next. The lathering was not as good and it was not bubbly enough for me. Hence I stopped using Edge brand."
5,A First Class Shaving Gel,I find this gel to be superior to the foamy Gillette product. It easily worked into a good uniform foam and I find no reason for a change to another product.
3,Former shave gel user,This shaving gel does not create an enjoyable shaving experience.1) Feels cold when you apply it to your face2) Foamed gel is thick & takes a little extra time to clean off face & razor (compared to shaving cream).3) Scent is strong and feels tingly on my sensitive skin - occasionally leading to after-shave irritation.4) Gel foam will dribble out of the pump nozzle after each use. Have to rinse out cap every time.
1,Nice Gel but a HUGE mess,I've been using Edge Gel for years but in the past year I had 2 cans leak the entire contents into my medicine cabinet leaving a huge slimy mess to clean up. I wont let it happen any more. Switchng to another brand
4,This is a vastly improved product. I found ...,"This is a vastly improved product. I found that it does relieve skin irritation to a certain degree. The can is also better now: It's easier to wipe off excess gel because of the new can design. Before I had problem with a half-empty can not having enough pressure to spit the gel, but my Test Drive can is still going strong."
3,I got a close shave and my face ...,"I got a close shave and my face felt softer, but I was not impressed with it. I will stay with the brand I've been using."
2,It doesn't make as much lather as a ...,"It doesn't make as much lather as a foam shaving cream. Leaves your face feeling greasy, and I wouldn't use it again."
4,A classic,"This book is terrific, with a narrative that is well integrated with the math. As noted by previous reviewers, van Kampen does a particularly good job of spelling out the necessary conditions for using Langevin techniques. My only complaint: some of the derivations are fast-and-loose, with typos that lead to confusion."
5,Hillbilly Music,"Product arrived as described on time. Slight wear on cover, otherwise actual record pristine, plays just fine. Three more words."
4,Decent Case...Not the best for protection!,"High Quality Leather. Solid Construction. The only reason this is not an excellent case is because it does not have a screen protector built into it, all it is is just an opening. It is my belief that keeping the screen clean and unscratched is most important with protecting a cell phone and this is where this case falls short..."
3,Product was Discolored - shipped from seller,"I had been looking for a really good R2D2 action figure for a really really long time, for a friend of mine who is a big fan! And i was really glad to find this one. The 3 star rating is not for the toy itself but for the condition in which it arrived. This wasn't fulfilled by Amazon so this feedback goes to the seller. It arrived perfectly on time and with good packaging. However, the toy was not white (as shown in the picture) but was discolored to yellowish cream color in front. This was probably due to the opening at the front of the plastic case. This wouldn't have been much of a problem if it wasn't going to be a gift. I didn't have the time to send it back and wait for a replacement. But it would definitely have been a better customer experience if I had got one that didn't look 20 years old :("
4,R2's dome does NOT swivel.,"Believe me, I've tried. Hasbro paid so much for the licenses to make these toys that they had to skimp on a lot of things to turn a profit. I love R2 and Star Wars, but I would say this toy is only marginally better than the vintage ones (I'm talking 1978). Sure the body's not just a sticker on a cylinder (old figure), it's molded plastic bumnps on a cylinder. Compare this to what you get from Playmates (who have the Simpsons license) and other companies (even Hasbro non-Star Wars) and you'll understand why I'm a little down on the quality. The sounds are cool, but the stationary head is unforgiveable...."
3,Interesting Information,"I ordered this book because an elderly relative developed ""musical ear syndrome"" and this was the only publication that had any description or data on the subject.The book was informative but did not give enough scientific explanations by way of scientific studies on the subject. It was, however, helpful to the elderly person and her caregivers to aid her until the situation abated. It was also helpful to know that other people had this syndrome even though most medical literature does not take note of this."
2,This product was not for me,This product was not quite what I thought it was going to be. It was more boasic than I wanted and not very informational for me. I had thought it would be a fun CD to listen to in the car but it wasn't. I would not recommend this to anyone who has had 2 or more semesters of Italian classes. It basically was on the cheesy side.
5,Tear jerker about a life well lived,"An outstanding book.I'm an emotional sap and cry at the drop of a hat, but if any one can read this book and not go through a few tissues they either have incredible emotional control or are extremely cold. I started this book yesterday after I got home, around lunch time. I finished it (250 pages) last night. I don't think I've ever done that before. It reads fast. It is the tragic, yet wonderful, true story of John Baker - one of American's best milers in 1969. He teaches elementary school kids and truly lives a life of purpose; a life well lived.Buy this book now and read it, but stock up on the tissues. You'll come away wishing you had known him. This is mostly a book about teaching kids and heroic character and doesn't talk much about running."
5,exceptional book - especially for teenage non-readers,"I have taught freshman English to all levels for 28 years, and this has been the single most popular book I have employed. Boys, girls, avid readers, non-readers - they all love this emotional, true account of a young athlete who finds he has cancer. I have had hundreds of students read this book for pleasure reading, and nearly every one has loved it and cried at the end. Students who have never read a book before stay up at night reading, and students who are voracious readers tell me it is the best book they have ever read"
3,OK but complicated,"Having upgraded from a Philips key mp3 player I had last year because it only had 256K at that time, I found the Sony unnecessarily complicated. With the Philips I was able to simply drag and drop mp3s onto the mp3 player (which appeared as a removable disk when connected) using standard windows operations. You can't do this with the Sony and have to either use the horrible Sonicstage software you get with it or the primitive mp3 file manager which you can download off their site. I found the sound inferior too, and the controls way too fiddly and complicated.Good things are that its stylish (it looks great with flashy leds) and has a long battery life, and of course 1GB of memory, but otherwise I preferrred my old Philips (Philips motto funnily enough is sense and simplicity - maybe Sony should listen)It's a reasonable machine but given hindsight I'd either go for one of the later Sony Walkmans (which now support mp3) or a newer Philips."
4,What you should know...,"This player is great. Small form-factor, sexy looks, logical user interface, and good sound quality (through Shure E2c's). However, what everyone should know, and why I submitted this review, is this: the Sony E407's OLED display is completely useless in direct sunlight. I can barely tell it is on, and I have had this confirmed by others. To some this could be a major flaw."
3,Great hardware but crappy software,"1. doesn't support mp3 directly (need to be converted by sonic stage)2. sonic stage is very picky about OS, read the manual and spec before you buy it.Wait for apple Nano!!"
2,Sounds like Fast Ca$h...,"This ""interview"" is recorded in mono, from what sounds like a micro-cassette recorder placed on a coffee table 10 feet from Erasure and the reporter. The first two minutes you hear the clink of spoons and tea cups, and a couple of guys with HEAVY English accents. I had to listen to it three times to make out the words between the tape hiss and the tea stirring. No revelations on this interview you can't find in a magazine interview. Just a way for the reporter to make a quick buck from us die-hard fans. Save yourself from 27 minutes of drivel, and buy the ""Drama!"" CD single or Abba-esque."
5,They are Great!! Loved hearing the voices.,It was so cool hearing them discuss music and the new album and singing and keyboards. This a nice change and a must for the serious Erasure fan.
5,Still Using IT!,I'm a student in a medical school and I'm still using this book whenever I need good quality pictures of anything from microscobic views of miosis to relatively simpler and understandable illustrations and tables.
4,AP biology,"This book is useful for AP biology. Best use would be in association with other sources - but it can be used by itself as well. Well written, good questions overall a good book."
5,colest toy ever,i love this toy because it has a lot of values like he uses the forse to open a box and pick up a gun it has a cool pancho you can choose the size of his lightsaber and you wont loose the lightsaber because it is conected to his hand
5,Star Wars,"This figure is pretty cool! It comes with a blaster the lightsaber and that box. It is cool cuz it can use the force. It's sculpting is great the poncho looks pretty real and the force abillity is awesome. Other toys you should get are Jango Fett, Clone Troopers, Super Battle droid, Count Tyrannus etc."
4,a ok toy,this toy is pretty cool but the magnet on the computer thing does not work the best and i wish the light saber was removable
3,The legacy Anakin Figure,"Ah a flashback to 25 years ago when I got my first Luke skywalker figure. The light saber up the sleeve worked better back then because we were not expecting as much and toys were not as sophisticated.My three year old son enjoys the figure (without the cape and the gun) because he can use the lightsaber. I would have preferred (for my collection) the seperate saber.The detail in the face and the clothing is excellent. The box works fine for my son and when I tried the force action out on the gun it seemed to work ok. For us older kids, I would wait for a better version of Anakin."
4,whats with the box,"I duno, but does anyone recall Anakin opening a box and taking out a gun? I don't. Did i miss that part?This figure is not as bad as those people ...say it is.The lightsaber is awesome, and the hilt is a little bulky but thats fine.The poncho and the box are pointless. ...the poncho would be good if it was cloth, but its plastic so he can't move in it. It doesnt really look like Hayden Christenson, and it seems small like Obi Wan Coruscant Chase.wait for a cooler anakin to come out"
4,CCR - Ultimate Collection.,"I always enjoy CCR, but the collection I had bought previously had a bonus disc. I was slightly disappointed by this."
1,Bad Quality,"The bowls and cups are fine but the plates are just poorly made.When you stack them you can see how far off they are, they are not all made the same. The printing is the worst thing though. We bought 12 settings and 6 of each plate sizes were terrible. Colors didn't match, big white patches, printed off center, and you could see through the red line on some. I called the company and they sent me replacements but they are just as bad. It is a nice pattern but if you care about quality at all, don't buy them!"
1,Corelle Dishes poorly packed,"I order two sets of Corelle Impressions 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4, Fresco style. In both sets, one of the cups was broken during shipment. I would not order Corelle products online for shipment based on this experience."
3,Buyer Beware,I am very happy with my purchase of Corelle dishes. I was very unhappy to find out that the mugs are not warrantied. I have already broken two.I would also like to say how happy I am with Amazon. When my dishes arrrived several where broken. Amazon shipped new ones immediately.
2,It'll do in an emergency,"We usually get Trader Joe's olive oil spray. We use it on popcorn and things that need an even, light coating for spices to stick to. I was relieved to find Pam had this olive oil spray when I couldn't get to Trader Joe's, but I was disappointed with it. It comes out in more of an uncontrollable streak than a spray. It'll do, but Trader Joe's is far superior."
3,not consistent,"Well I had this keyboard for over a year now.At first I didnt have any problem with distance but recently I am starting to have problems when I am over 2.5 feet away, thank goodness my den is not too big.The connection is not strong anymore .And its not the battery. It's possible something is interferring with the 2.4Ghz.But I really like the design, the buttons, the trigger button, I am use to thumb designed roller ball but this one is abit too slippery.They should make the roller ball heavier."
3,"It is good, but...","Good product but the track ball has poor accuracy. If you want the keybord for regular service, then is perfect. If you want to use it with programs like pictures editor then the track ball can be an issue."
4,"Great, except for the mouseeeeeeeeeeee","This is really an awesome keyboard and works well from any angle or any part of the room. The problem is the roller-ball mouse. It is very tricky to use. I bought this keyboard to use in the classroom and I can use it with no problem, but my students find it very frustrating. If you get used to it, the mouse is fine. But it has not worked well in my classroom because my students can't get the hang of it. It definitely takes practice to get used to the mouse. With a wireless mouse, this would be perfect.Like I said, it's a great keyboard and works really well. Plus, it's a bargain at this price!"
2,Couldn't get it to work.,"First of all, it comes with a very short directions page, that has no ""help"" contact number. I followed the directions exactly, and it worked for about 2 seconds before freezing. Rebooting didn't help. I had to plug my usb mouse and keyboard in to be able to use the computer again. There's no way to ""reset"" the system and try again, as far as I can tell. So, I left it uplugged and tried it again a few hours later. Finally, I got it to work. I spent about ten minutes surfing the web using the keyboard, before it froze again. When it worked, it was really great, but the random freezing thing is a major problem for me. Perhaps I got a defective keyboard. I'll be sending it back, for a new one, rest assured. Hopefully, that'll fix the problem.Good luck."
5,Perfect for a Media PC setup,"This is the perfect keyboard/mouse combination for a Media PC type of setup. I previously had an infrared keyboard and mouse combo, and I found that despite their claimed ranges I had to get them within about 5 feet of the TV before they would work reliably. With this keyboard I can comfortably sit on the couch and use it with no problems. Having the trackball integrated into the keyboard is also very convenient. I consider it far superior to a mouse for this kind of application, because you can use it without having to find a flat, smooth surface to move the mouse around on. If you hold the keyboard with one hand on each side, you can easily move the trackball with your right thumb, click the mouse buttons with your left thumb, and use the scroll wheel with one of your left fingers. I found it surprisingly comfortable."
2,Keyboard keys not responding correctly',The keyboard keys not responding correctly most of the time I have to press the key 2 to 3 times in order to workI dont like this keyboard and I dont recomend it
2,Left click stopped working,Keyboard worked great then the left click function in all 3 areas it can be used stopped working. Only had the POS for about 4 weeks. I threw away the box it came in so Amazon won't take it back. I have to send it back to Adesso. They are asking in the RMA to return it in the original packaging. Crap! Going to send it back anyway and see what happens. Hopefully they'll replace it and the new one will work.
5,Well made wireless keyboard,"The quality of the craftmanship on this keyboard is excellent. The keys, right and left mouse click buttons and trackball have excellent feel and response. You can point the keyboard in a wide direction when typing. The size fits very comfortably on your lap and has well made rubber pads underneath. I have my computer hooked up to the TV and sit back on the couch or chair typing away with great comfort and reliability. I would not hesitate to buy another one."
5,Great Keyboard,I use this with a computer that is hooked up to my TV. The trackball and the buttons are positioned very ergonomically if you are sitting on the couch with the keyboard on your lap.I have used this for almost a year and so far have only replaced the batteries once.
2,Functional while it lasts,"I've had this for about 8 months now and the scroll wheel has stopped working. After disassembly, I discovered the mediocre build quality. The scroll wheel does not use an optical photomicrosensor design like just about every other mouse / keyboard wheel but two small contact switches instead. The support shaft for the wheel itself broke off after repeated wheel presses. Unfortunately the wheel is a critical component in my opinion for any internet or HTPC use.The range suffers due to a low quality transceiver. My receiver is about 12 feet away and unless I hold this just right in my lap it the signal loss is terrible.Battery life is also quite poor.The only good thing about this unit is the attention to ergonomic design. The scroll wheel, trackball and buttons are all placed in logical and easily accessed locations."
4,Good....,Good cute nice range.... especially helpful when you have ur laptop or PC hooked on to TV you can sit at the other end.
4,Pleased with the Purchase,"The Wireless Rf Mini Multimedia USB Kyb definitley has the range it advertises. It is also compact, yet efficient which is a great plus for incorporating into a home theatre system. Only con is that the keyboard starts up with the num lock on."
3,A so so keyboard for daily use,"wireless and integrated trackball are good features to have. With this keyboard, the feel of the keys is too firm. The trackball is low in accuracy so when you are trying to highlight one or two characters, it's difficult. Also, moving the cursor acorss the screen quickly is not possible. It appears the trackball mnovement is not detected. So the movement sensor is not as good as a $20 trackball mouse from most manufacturers. It's probably a good product for occasional use. It will take some patience if your intention is to replace your regular keyboard with this."
2,"Great design, but poor wireless reception and build quality","I have been using this keyboard for about 8 months. The ergonomic design is perfect for using with a home theater PC. The trackball, mouse buttons, and scroll wheel are placed in smart locations and the design works really well for use in your lap with both hands. That being said, there are some issues with this keyboard that may sway you to look to other options.The wireless technology of this keyboard is a bit suspect. If you do not have line of sight from the keyboard to the USB receiver or are more than 6 feet away from the receiver, the connection breaks resulting in random missed keystrokes and button clicks. I am always proofreading text I write to make sure there were no missed letters. This is very frustrating.The build quality is also suspect as I had the keyboard fail after a few months of use. I have been using the replacement for about 4 months now with no problems."
3,Not as good as rated,PROs:1. It works.2. Good wireless range. I have no problem using it from 20 ft away.Cons:1. Cheap plastic feel. Keys feels cheap and track ball isn't smooth.2. Amazon shipped me something that looks like returned item. The box was beat up and has been opened previously.
3,Sting talks about himself,"This CD is a nice choose for fans. Sting talks about his music, life and the things he likes."
4,FBTMOF Does it again...,"first off, the complete track listing for this album is:1: Hey Kid, I'm a computer, stop all the downloading2: Should have stayed in the shallows3: Consequences David You'll meet your fate in the Styx4: Whiskey is alright in its place but its place is in hell5: The story of the curious oysters6: Absolutely fabulous and me7: The long road to the middle8: The state of Texas vs. Fear Before9: Law of averages10: A tyrant meets his maker11: The God Awful TruthThis album is an evolution of their first release. Their music has become much more complicated, but the same general idea is there. The mastering though is SIGNIFICANTLY different... much less raw but it's not overly produced either.Overall it's a good album, my favorite song is track #2, and anyone who has been to one of their shows in the last year or so will recognize many of the songs.Definitely worth the purchase!"
1,not worth the money,"This book provides no insight into developing a mini storage complex. I received as much information free over the internet as this book provided. I would not recommend to anyone. If someone wishes a copy of this book, I will send mine for free."
4,Another side to Penny,I first discovered the Penny series when I stumbled across Measuring Penny while looking for books for my preschool class that taught measuring concepts. It was so fabulous that I now have a library of Loreen Leedy's great books!
4,Strong but short,I was really impressed with the impact of the scented oil candle smell. It DID fill my room AND in a very short amount of time. It looks pretty and adds a wonderful mood with the lit flame. The only down side is that they don't last very long. But the refills are cheap enough to buy. I do wish they would package a few fragrances together in one package so I can try them out.
1,"Glade can knock ""Boutique Candles"" but...","What Glade is knocking and referring to as ""boutique"" candles in their ad campaign are almost ALL AMERICAN MADE! Most are made by small start-ups by SAHMs who are supporting American made products by purchasing all American made ingredients, including the containers.Of course Glade can undercut these prices, they are sending the contracts to china! They are manufacturing a product made entirely of ingredients and parts that are from china. NOTHING AMERICAN ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, other than the slick American advertising meant to further hurt and demean American business.If SC Johnson chooses to take not support American manufacturing,that is all well and good, their mistake in my opinion, is using their ad campaigns to demean those few products we have left that are entirely American made.PLEASE BUY AMERICAN!"
1,If i could it would have been a 0,These have to be the biggest pieces of junk i have ever used. I figured because they were 2.4ghz they might be better than the 900 mhz pair i had. They weren't they have a fair less range than the 900mhz do. Don't bother buying them i throw them in the trash after having them for 2 days. Waste of time and money.
1,NOT WELL CONSTRUCTED,"After only a few weeks of gentle use, the pieces that hold the earphones cracked and fell apart. I now hold it together with electrical tape. Otherwise, it works just about as advertised.After so many years of sturdy headphone manufacturing, you'd think this is one thing that they could've gotten right."
2,Not what I expected,"These headphones aren't up to expectations. The general fit is loose to the point where the ear pieces do not stay put and they dont grip your head.The audio quality is dissapointing. Unless there is constant signal output from the headphones, electronic HUM (quite loud in fact) is all you will hear. In order to get a workable audio, you must turn down the volume control on the headset to the point where it almost becomes inaudible.Unless you aren't concerned with quality, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Knocks out your wireless internet,"I bought these on impulse for $30. They are cheaply made (which I would expect), and come with no instructions. The three major drawbacks are: (1) it knocks out my 802. 11g wifi connection TOTALLY and INSTANTLY when turned on (even with a 98% signal strength). I got it to be able to watch TV and use my laptop without disturbing my sleeping wife, not even for listening to music. (2) There is an incessant right-click, left-click repeated over all channels (perhaps interference from another device). (3) the hiss reported by others is hard to minimize.I am taking these back for a refund. I would avoid these even at this price."
1,confirmed that this case is too small,"Supporting previous reviews, this case does not fit the NV11,not even close, thus any quality descriptions are irrelevent. It is unfortunate that Amazon (and other camera shops) have an option to buy this case with this camera. However, the NV11 does need a case."
3,Too small for camera Amazon pushes for this case,"Amazon gives a ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" recommendation for this case under the Samsung NV11. Since I have the NV11, I bought the case. I mean, all those people couldn't be wrong, could they?But yeah, they were wrong. The NV11 just plain will not fit. If through some miracle you are able to force-fit the camera, it will be poorly protected.Some cameras in the NV series may fit within this case just fine. But definitely NOT the NV11. Amazon should remove the link from ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought""..."
1,Tiger patch flop,Looked at the reviews of this item prior to my purchase and thought wow this is what I need. When I received it I was quite disappointed in the fact that I could not get it to stick to my pipe. I did as it said but this would not work. Finally as a last ditch effort I wrapped this on and covered it with DUCT tape to hold in place and let the truck idol for 1/2 hour. Did this do the trick? Naw just got alittle harder and let the leak right out. Inexpensive repair wasn't worth it.
4,A necessity for avoiding costly shop repairs,"Loads of info. About 2.5 inches thick, like a phone book.The images and text are good, but not sufficient - you'll need to look up supplementary info on the web, or have a cheapo Hayne's manual alongside to be efficient with it. This book definitely gives you the correct factory info, saved my @$$ many times.With that, it is still GOOD, a NECESSITY (perhaps a necessary evil?)."
5,Could not live without it,This is a must for anyone owning an Audi. For example. The dealership told me I needed to replace my coolant temp sensor. Okay... $100 for the part and another $100 to install it. So i took it in the butt and paid it. A year later they said it needed to be replaced and i needed to flush my coolant and add a newer more up to date coolant as well as some other minor things and there estimate was close to a grand. So I got this book and ordered the parts on line and did it all myself. Brought the car in for inspection later on and they asked where the work was done because it was great and were wondering why I did not use them. I smiled and said thanks. Not a word more. This book made it simple and combined with other info on the web and pictures it saved me a pile of money as dealerships are so expensive. Completely worth it.
1,Unacceptable DVD quality,"Don't buy this. The DVD is too poorly made to be enjoyable or even watchable. The picture is jittery and the colors are faded. The DVD is a Chinese-made piece of junk. Perhaps if you paid $1 for it from a street vendor in Beijing you'd be content, but this is in no way a commercially marketable product.The movie itself is excellent, BTW . . ."
1,Song Without End DVD,"This DVD was purchased to replace an older VHS tape. The DVD of this movie was apparently produced in China. Upon viewing, the picture quality was very poor--much more faded colors than in the older VHS tape. The subtitles appear to have been translated from English to Chinese, and then back to English, as the language was stilted and rather strange at times. We returned the DVD on Oct 30, 2009, and asked Import CD to credit our Amazon account for the amount of the DVD. After waiting a month and hearing nothing back from the company, I sent them an email on Dec. 1, 2009, asking if they had received the DVD and were going to credit our Amazon account. Now, 15 days later, I have still gotten no response from my email request.I would rate their customer relations as being very poor, and would caution people from doing business with this company."
1,What a Disappointment!!,"I cannot believe what poor quality this DVD has! It's blurry, the sound is bad, scenes have been cut. This is a total waste of money! Thank God I saved my VHS copy. I love this movie and I can't imagine why they desecrated it like this. Hang onto your VHS copies or try to find them, they are 100 times better!"
3,Future Leadership Styles,"The first serveral chapters were excellent. Many of the later chapters were so-so. Presents a vision of where the Army needs to go with leadership. Thesis is that leadership will not be replaced by a digitized army but will become more important than ever. Calls for new paradigms in the way senior leaders lead. Although not directed at business leadership, I believe the underlying principles apply. Despite all its problems, once properly motivated, no organization can go from zero to lightspeed faster than the army. This book examines how to develop future organizational structure and leadership to do just that."
3,so so,seem like glorified diapers if you ask me. did not help with training my daughter. did like the pull away sides though. too expensive
4,Mixed feelings,"Pull-ups don't help with potty training. Your best bet is to put them in cloth training pants and just clean up their messes. They will learn faster that way. Pull-ups are just glorified diapers (and expensive to boot). I got these as part of the Unilever $50 rebate. My 2 year old daughter loves them because there are princesses on them. But I'm not really pushing potty training with her right now. Pull-ups leak faster than regular diapers which is good for potty training, but it's not really going to help too much. She sure likes to have her diaper (pull-up) changed now. Also, you can find them less expensive in a regular store."
3,"Works, but beware","PNY claims that no drivers are needed for this reader to work with Windows XP. I tried both XP Home and Professional and the only way I could get the reader to work was to use the drivers on the CD. The only reason I give this product three stars is due to the frustration of trying to figure out what was wrong and the fact that PNY's support site incorrectly states that drivers aren't necessary for XP.On a side note, I can plug in and mount the reader as a SCSI drive (/dev/sda1) in Linux with no problems."
4,An interesting read,"As a Brit having lived in Italy many years ago, I always like to take the opportunity to return there even though I am at present just an armchair traveller. Tim Parks writes a witty and interesting story and gives insight to the inner workings of the bureacracy and the ""system"". The trials and tribulations of everyday life are well chronicled including the hysterial neighbor and the barking dog. At times I wish the author had ""opened the door a little wider"" by telling us what he had when he dined out and just a few more titbits about his personal life. He leaves it to the reader to surmise that his wife is actually an Italian. I highly recommend the book and can't wait to read the sequel. Enjoy it!"
2,Nice Flavors but Disconnected,"Parks gives the reader a series of vignettes with a slim narrative connection but his stories never seem to come alive with a true appreciation for Italy. Although I found bits and pieces to be very good -- choosing a cafe, for example, or first sampling his neighbor's prosecco wine -- on the whole the book left me with absolutely no desire to visit the Italy of his experiences, and no interest in reading any of Parks' other books."
5,This is really us!,"I bought this book when I was homesick (I am from Verona leaving in the US). Reading it made me feel so much better that I abandoned the idea of being depressed. The author does an excellent job at describing how we think in Verona and how people live in the small towns around it. I could see exactly the expressions of the faces of the carachters in the book while I was reading, and sometimes I would be amazed to discover the author's perspective of the reason we do things like always wear slippers in the house, etc... I bought this book for my boyfriend and I highly recommend this book to anyone who's partner is Italian because it pictures extremely well how Italians are like and why."
2,Minority opposition,"I see that I'm definitely not in the majority, here. I found Tim Parks' book to be an immense disappointment. As an American who's been living in Italy for nearly 12 years, I found very little I could relate to from my own experience. I was horrified at the plotting to poison the neighbors' dog (who was sadly mistreated), for instance. While his descriptions of certain frustrating aspects of contemporary Italian bureaucracy, housing, etc. are spot-on, unlike other reviewers I often found his tone to be patronizing towards the Italians he encounters in everyday life. An Italian friend, fluent in English, loaned me this book without giving me any hints as to what she thought of it; after I'd finished, she was relieved to find that I was as taken aback as she was at his characterization of his adopted country. ""I would be terribly upset if every expat felt this way about Italy!"" she told me. As much as I have enjoyed his fiction, Tim Parks' nonfiction left me cold."
2,No appreciation of Italy,"I found this book tedious, slow-paced and not at all what I expected. For some reason, I thought an expat who has chosen to live in Italy would find the country and its people beautiful, as I do. Instead, he seems intent on telling only the bad, the worse and the ugly. Sure, it can be a pain dealing with the government, but I bet it is in nearly any country (I think it is in the USA). I was also disappointed because Parks hinted at a mystery--a bit of a plot--when he wrote early in the book that the Professor, whose flat they were renting, would turn out to be a very interesting character in the end. I don't think he ever wrote another word to fulfill this promise. I'm not sure 2 stars is low enough, but there were some interesting bits, quirks and traditions I enjoyed reading about. I would also add that I very much agree with the 3 other 2 star reviews which are already posted."
3,Music is a 5 - other stuff is a 1,"I purchased the CD ROM called Headcandy when it first came out. It was early in the life of PC video playback, and the psychedelic content of this was dissapointing to me. I liked the music quite a bit though.Years later Eno released his book 'A Year With Swollen Apendices', in which he shares the sad fact that this product is one of the only regrets he's ever had professionally. I was glad to read that, and I'm glad its no longer available.Let it go. The 'visualizations' in Windows Media Player blow it away.The music is excellent though. I hope it is released as a music CD at some point."
1,Hmmm.,"As someone who spends at least a month every year in Mexico struggling to perfect my Spanish and understand Mexican culture, I'm always drawn to books written by people who seem to share the same passion. This book, however, seemed to be written by someone wallowing in self-pity (not a crime) while passing through Mexico jotting down a few notes and getting them published because of his connection to National Geographic (a crime). Do yourself a favor and travel through Mexico and write your own book. Of course you may not get it published. I gave it one star because minus one star wasn't an option on Amazon's rating list and any anyone who write's anything is doing something, which is better than doing nothing. Or maybe not."
3,A bit like a travel magazine.,"I thought the book was going to be a narrative of his travels with his children through Mexico. What I got was extremely brief blurbs about different areas, like you'ld read in a travel magazine. Which is where the articles came from,I believe. Just too brief to really get into.The best part of the book was the last section where the articles were much longer and gave you some real insight into Mexican culture and it's effect on the author.A little dissappointing overall."
3,Barbara Steiner-The Mummy-review,"I thought it was a very good book. Some parts of the book actually gave me the chills. I thought it was a little ... how Lana was in high school, and was volunteering all her spare time to work at the museum. I don't think anybody of that age would actually get their hair cut to look like an Egyptian princess, but it was very descriptive. I liked how Barbara used her imagination to make Lana's role model,... It was a big surprise to me. I liked how she kept describing Nefra and Lana's feelings when she was by his coffin-type thing.Overall, I think that Barbara did a great job, but she needed to make Lana not be so involved in everything about Egypt, that she would rather volunteer at the museum than be with her cheerleading boyfriend, Josh."
5,Great documentary,Shows the history from different angle. Carefully made and extremly interesting.All major political figures presented with care.
5,NewPerspective on WW2,Well done docu-drama format that really put a new perspective on what happened between the Big Three in WW2. Revelations on Roosevelt/Churchill; and how they used Poland in the War were big surprises. The Soviet's murder of the Polish Officers and their cover up was shocking.Behind Closed Doors was truly a look into what happened..... Had to watch all 6 hours in one week end...could not stop.
5,The Truth behind WW2,This movie made by the Brits outlines the behind the scenes look at World War 2. It shows key players and their side line politics which in the end cost other countries loss of land and the freedoms that were fought for during the war. Everyone should watch this to really get a good look at the horrors of that war.
5,World War II: Behind Closed Doors,I read the book and then watched the DVD. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the DVD so much. I learned things I didn't know and I thought the acting was superb. I will watch it more than once.
5,Revealing series very well made,"This is 20th century history that we, as Americans, are by and large fairly ignorant of. Pearl Harbor, D-Day, and Battle of the Bulge have obscured our knowledge of the most devastating and in many ways more significant aspects of World War II on the eastern front. The dramatized sections are excellently produced and portrayed, which only the BBC seems to be able to do so well. It gives us a glimpse of the power dealing leading to some of the most violent and tragic consequences of the war. Highly recommended."
5,My Mom was right,"I was born in 1940 and always remembered how my Polish mother used to say how much she hated the Russians. Her parents fled Poland before all this began, and they were smart doing so.While I have studied WW2 for 50 years, I must admit I never really knew how bad the Russians were toward Poland during WW2.They were about the same as the Nazis, but Stalin, I think, was even more vicious than Hitler...if that's possible.Well, now I know that my Mother was right. It was painful watching but superbly done.PS Please don't write me and say that all the Russians were not as bad as Stalin like all the Germans were not like Hitler.But, they surely loved what was happening when things were going their way! Watch the new films during that time"
5,Love it,"Love Blue Ray on HD TV. Everything is sharper and tons more clearer. I wasn't sure about having Timothy Dalton play James Bond, but he did an admirable job. Each man that has portrayed Bond, brought his own person into the character. But as I tell my husband they act as the director wants them to.This movie reminds me of ""On her majesty's secret service."" He lost his wife and grief settled in as he fought his enemies. His friend Leiter gets married an looses his wife and almost his life thanks to Sanchez and his hooligans. But he too fights back as Bond does and doesn't let anything get in his way.Grittier than his other movies. There wasn't anything funny about this movie. Parts are horrific and others you just cheer on the good guys."
5,"The download worked well, and the movie is a solid showing","The movie is a fantastic and unheralded bond adventure. Worth the low price. The download works well, and brings up no technical difficulties. A well displayed and well performing prodcuct."
4,My first Bond movie.,"Licence to Kill is definitely one of the better Bond movies, I'd certainly rank it in the top ten. It also stands well on its own, as a fun but still dramatic action movie. It's absolutely worth seeing.My full review is here: [...]"
2,PROBLEM,I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT. IT WAS SEALED AS IF NEW EVEN THOUGH IT SAID USED. BUT THE PRODUCT FREEZES AND CAUSES ME TO REBOOT MY SYSTEM.
5,One of my favorite fantasy/suspense books of all time.,"If you like veins-in-your-teeth horror, this isn't for you. But if you like extraordinarily well-written, deeply unsettling fiction that captures its setting and action so vividly that a later trip to the actual locale revealed no surprises, then this IS for you. After reading ""Our Lady Of Darkness"" I happened to have a chance to travel to the Corona Heights park in San Francisco and other locales depicted in the book and went ""Wow. Leiber REALLY captured this place."" Few authors could have equalled the visionary characteristics of Leiber's writing. I recommend this book to all my friends."
1,Our Lady of Darkness,Great book but the worthless publisher didn't even read this manuscript as it is so riddled with typos that it is barely readable. Amazon really needs to no take every damn digital edition uploaded to them. This is the kind of work that really hurts digital editions overall.Please Amazon clean up your act and make sure that you are dealing with reputable publishers.
1,Kindle edition is riddled with typos,"This was a good read, and I enjoyed it very much. The reading, however, proved cumbersome due to the large number of repeaded typos. Apparently the book was digitized by some flawed automated system, because the typos were of the same type (""mat"" where it should read ""that"") over and over, but always the typos resulted in real words, which, of course, foils the trusty spell checker. In my experience, the free books that are pounded out by volunteers are of much higher quality."
4,Return of the Royal Guards!,"When i saw this in the store i picked it up right away. I loved the old imperial guard figure from ROTJ but i lost it and i figured this would be a good replacement.The articulation is pretty standard on this figure. It has shoulder, wrist, forearm and waist joints. Even with the lack of artiuculation this figure is still great to play with. The accesories are kind of dissapointing. The staff fits in the hands alright but the lightning effect is kind of hard to attach to the staff. The design is what makes up for the articulation and accesories. The guard wears a long crimson cloak and mask. Under the cloak are dark red fatuiges.Rating: 9 out of 10"
4,I would like to buy it !!!,"Hi people from countries where amazing,com is having it's rates (sales their books). I live in Poland where plenty of Ford Taurus car are in use now, but their owners can not buy the Manual of it from amazing.com jus because the live in Poland. It is silly not selling books here !!!Please dear owner of Taurus from the country where they have their rates contact with me on: rafal.jaworski@bpb.com.pl and help me with buying two cheap books about it (maximum price is 15$).Thanks in advance.RJ"
3,a great split,"this is a fun split cd by two cool bands.aftertax is a basic indie-rock punk group along the line sof early superchunk and archers of loaf (y'know...that ""college sound"" haha). but they have some good jams and the song ""big trap"" will get stuck in your head for all time! they use some unique recording tricks and cool changes in their music to give it a quirky edge.the rusty nails are more of a straight up punk rock and roll band...except for one small thing: they are led by a crazed bagpiper! haha-yes! how cool is that? they play some of their own great songs and mix it up with some traditional songs rocked up in their scottish punk style. they close the disc off with a fiery ""when the saints go marching in.""a cool split cd by two bands that have broken up.oh by the way...jack ball is the tom jones of this generation."
2,Very basic book with little useful information.,"Although the pictures are great, there is actually very little useful information contained w/i this book. It was too basic for me and was a let down."
1,Seller sent the WRONG one and it was garbage.,"Like the title says. Perhaps if the seller sent me the right headset it might have been OK. If you order one of these and get a no-name unit with an in-line volume control, SEND IT BACK!!!! Unit lasted about 1 week."
3,It Burns!,"While I understand your desire to clean your face, and clean it well, this formula makes skin ""sensitive skin."" I couldn't wash without the feeling I was using a medicated soap or bleach to wash my face, and I could feel the smell get into my eyes and nose. After using for about a week, I gave up and got the foaming clenser instead. It does the job, it's just very strong. If you *really* need some powerful cleaning, this'll work."
3,good...not great,"1st. half of the book is interesting since it gives a lot of perspectives on each of the major 4 supermarkets. The rest of the book is the same discussion on global expansion over and over using the same examples and failures used in the 1st. half. Interesting to read, but not the best source of knowledge."
5,Best album of all time.,"Undertone of death throughout. Puts all artists, country or otherwise, to shame. I just can't describe the brilliance of these recordings."
3,Just so so,A little disappointed to receive this cell case. The case looks ok but the leather is fake and made with leatheroid. You will feel hard and not that comfortable and somewhat hulking.
2,Poor belt clip design,It is keeping falling out of belt . Bad clip design .Other Sony Cell Phone cases I used had much better clip.Do not recommend this type .
2,Fanny pack!,"This is not at all what I expected. Apparently there are models of sony ericsson phones that are significantly larger than mine because this case is much larger than needed. Also, it does not have the option of belt loops. Consequently, it is frequently slipping off my belt."
4,I liked Buf-Puf Facial Sponge. It left my ...,"I liked Buf-Puf Facial Sponge. It left my face feeling realy clean. Yes, I've already recommended this to women I work with."
3,I liked the how the Buf-Puf left my ...,"I liked the how the Buf-Puf left my face feeling very soft, and it really did a great job exfoliating with my regular facial wash. It did seem to be a bit rough and even hurt a bit while I was using it. If your skin isn't too sensitive, this would be just perfect. But if it's even the slightest bit sensitive, you might want to go for something more gentle."
3,I simply used it to wipe off the ...,I simply used it to wipe off the excess foam of my cleanser. I really don't care for the texture of the sponge and wouldn't recommend it.
5,keep with it,buff-puff is rough at first but keep with it. I used to have terrible acne...no more and I get comments on how young my skin looks.
4,extra gentle buf-puf,I have been using extra gentle buf-pufs for years and love them. They keep my skin smooth and free of clogged pores. I don't know what to do without them. They are no longer available in Nova Scotia or Massachusetts. CVS sells a house brand that is similar but it is too rough. 3M Health Care is missing a huge audience of middle aged to older people who need the extra gentle product. What's going on?
4,"I enjoyed Test Driving"""" the Buf-Puf Facial Sponge, ...","I enjoyed Test Driving"""" the Buf-Puf Facial Sponge, Original Gentle! My skin doesn't feel """"clean"""" (especially after wearing makeup) unless I wash with mild soap and some sort of puff. As I get older, the ones I could use as a teenager are just too rough for my skin. This is by far the most gentle puff I've found so far. I'll continue to use this product."
4,I found that it's still a bit rough ...,"I found that it's still a bit rough for my face, which is somewhat sensitive. My skin is red and blotchy for a few minutes after use, even with light pressure. But it clears up quickly and the texture has definitely improved. The sponge rinses clean easily and dries quickly if left on a ventilated shelf. I'll continue to use this product 1-2 times per week with a gentle soap and would recommend it to anyone who wants to exfoliate their skin to control acne or improve the texture of their skin."
4,"I thought the product was fine, but a ...","I thought the product was fine, but a slight bit too rough. If I was too rough with it, it left red patches on my face. But my face definitely felt cleaner after using it, and it helped to smooth out some rough areas on my forehead. My son tried it and he didn't like it. It was too rough for his 14-year-old skin."
2,Spotty at best (and I don't mean the cow print),"This is a novel concept in coffee making, but when I have to say ""Results May Vary"" for an $80-plus appliance, I can't give it a full recommendation. Lattes come out either not hot enough or speckled with coffee grounds (no matter the grind), while cappuccinos come out with speckled grounds and a froth that's just not thick enough. For my cappuccinos and lattes, I'll stick with theBialetti Brikka, which makes the closest thing to machine-style espresso on the stovetop (crema and all), and microwave my milk for 1 minute then use a battery-operated hand frother (orBodum milk churn) for the milk and froth."
4,Great alternative to an out of control latte budget,"Love this, though it can be a bit temperamental at times! It def only makes one full mug of coffee though, so I would not be expecting to serve two people at once :)You have to be really careful to put it together correctly every time you use it, and watch it like a hawk while on the stove: you need to turn off the heat a few seconds after you hear the click and it starts foaming or it will overflow onto your stove. Sometimes it will spew out of the bottom for no discernable reason but over all it is great! I havent felt the urge to go to starbucks for a latte since I received this. For those unable to purchase a 'real' espresso machine at this time due to cost or space issues, this is the way to go."
2,Valve fails,"Take a while to get it to work right, must be exactly the right amount of flame or heat on the bottom. The first valve failed after about 6 months, a new valve worked for a while then also fails, does not deliver what it claims. I wish this worked right, but I am not buying any more valves, think it will just fail again."
2,Unreliable,When it works out it makes the greatest cup of cappuccino ever but even when I am very careful to ensure the lip and seal is clean it will steam over making a mess and this last time it never popped and while the latte is yummy the pot is burnt/dammaged.
4,Quick Cappucino,"I saw the Mukka Stovetop cappuccino maker in Italy and wanted to bring back a couple for my college-bound daughters, but what with the rate of exchange being so execrable, I desisted. However, here they are on Amazon so I bought two. You get a 2 cups of cappuccino or one large latte in about 4 minutes with minimal clean up and it tastes great! The Mukka comes with an instructional dvd but it's completely unneccesary, as it's simplicity itelf to use. Plus the cow design looks nicely whimsical on the stove. (It is also available in plain metal) Obviously it needs a stove in order to use it, so it's not appropriate for dorm-livers, but for the coffee enthusiast who would like a taste of Italy in their home, this is a cute and efficient kitchen tool."
3,"Bought one, then took it back","I had mixed results with this machine. As others write - you must follow the instructions to the letter. I must have been doing something wrong, because I had lots of problems. If you buy one of these machines, you *MUST* keep your eye on it while it's on the stove. Don't turn away... It can boil over and create a collossal mess on your stove. If you buy one, make sure the seller has a liberal return policy in case you have problems.The other thing I didn't like was that there's a lot of cleanup after you brew your cappucino or latte. Some of the new modern machines require almost *NO* cleanup."
2,Choose something else,"I bought the Cappucino Maker because it looked easy to use. The directions were not that great. But what I dislike the most is that it always boils over onto my stove. I have tried different temperatures when heating, but it always makes a mess. Plus there doesn't seem to be a way to make changes,ie. stronger coffee, more milk, etc. I should have taken it back."
4,love it!,"This little item has brought great joy to my mornings. I had been using a little bialetti moka pot for my morning coffee and adding milk from the fridge. The Mukka Express is a bit more effort, but is more than worth it. As other reviewers have revealed, it is not foolproof (the reason for the 4 star review). There have been 2 times (in over 30 uses) when it leaked. Unfortunately, when this occurs, you have to start over (much hassle). There have also been a few times when it has not produced much foam (still good, though. I think this has to do with how well I've cleaned it). But, on the whole, the end-product is just as promised - a good strong latte with a lot of foam. Because there's milk involved, it does take a bit longer to clean than the regular moka pot. But, it is not too much trouble for the joy of a good cappuccino at my own kitchen table."
1,BEWARE,It EXPLODED all over my kitchen causing great damage!!! I had it for over a year with out issue. No warning was given that it was in any way ready to explode. I wrote the company without even a resonse!
1,Save yourself the trouble,I bought this machine a few months ago - used it twice and never again... Made a huge mess on my stovetop and was extremely hard to clean... Nice to look at though...
2,Not impressed.,"I got this for my wife for her birthday.We follow the directions to the letter, and still it randomly overflows out the bottom. We will keep trying, but there seems to no rhyme or reason as to why. We follow the DVD that comes with it, though the directions state the same thing, and don't waste :15 minutes of your time. The DVD is a little silly.Mukka is a glorified teapot, that cost 80 bucks.If I want a cappuccino or latte I can bang one out on my Krupps cappuccino maker and not have to diligently make sure I have all grains of espresso off the threads. Is this thing popular because it is cute? Cow spots? Dunno...Just unimpressed.Anything this simple, yet subject to a learning curve of ongoing practice is flawed in my opinion. Good luck."
2,splattering seal,"I would love to love this product, but it just doesn't work well. We are on our third one and the seal between the top and bottom just doesn't hold tight. Coffee ends up splattering out of that joint and all over the stove top. We've tightened it until the point of not being able to unscrew it and it still bubbles out. How hard is it to make a functional seal?"
3,"Hard to use, doesn't live up to the hype","I had high hopes for this cappuccino maker being an easy way to have a cup in the morning. The first time I used it, it leaked coffee all over my gas stove. After some adjusting, I was able to keep it from leaking, but now it's very difficult to unscrew even after it has cooled down for hours. So cleanup is tough. I will say that it makes good coffee. I was hoping for more of a latte consistency, but the water and milk volumes are not flexible."
2,Understand before you buy,"I bought this thinking its simple and straight-forward. Add water, coffee and milk and put it on the stove. End product is frothy coffee latte. Actually I got the expected result on the 1st day. That's it. Never again! Cleaned the maker yet never got the same result again. If I am doing something wrong then this maker is not straight-forward. Cleaning is not easy at all due to the shape of maker parts. And most important is the pressure value. Don't know how best to clean that. So its upto you now."
3,Do wash in dishwasher!!,"I rate this product a 3 because it is not perfect. It makes a good cup of cappuccino with practice.If not careful it will leak, which can get quite messy. Making the perfect frost seems random.This is a good product and get a good feeling of satisfaction when you get it right.Finally do not put in dishwasher, the surface on the inside of the top chamber starts to dissolve.This gray silky surface starts to loosen, you may start drinking that material.I threw my away, but am now concern what's in my body."
1,Tank Problems,"I too had trouble with the tank leaking. My hands are small, making it very difficult to screw the top onto the tank tightly enough, so I learned to make sure it was on good, and made cappuccino successfully twice. Well, this morning I made very sure it was on tight. Perhaps I put too much coffee in it?? I did not tamp it down, though. Turned on the stove and waited. All that happened was that the milk boiled - no coffee. I finally poured the milk out and hoped the coffee would come up. It never did. Then I had a time removing the button mechanism - finally got it off, but I cannot get the tank top unscrewed!! I may have to send it back with a note that the tank contains coffee and water! Very disappointed!"
5,It's wonderful. Clean well for happiness.,"The mukka Express rocks. But there are some small tips:1) Use it, clean it, this means taking all parts off and cleaning well (specially the gasket) and the pressure valve.2) Expresso ground. Anything else and it won't work correctly3) Rub the rim with your index finger before you screw the top on4) Screw the top TIGHTLY. This may require big hands!Perfection.OK - Have had this now for over a year. And it rocks. The only thing I want is a stainless-steel version that can be dish washed without damaging the finish."
4,Excellent espresso,"I'm no cappucino fan, but my wife is...and Mukka Express does the job.Takes a couple of uses to get the desired cappucino/or espresso taste and frothiness.Excellent product, only downside is, capacity. I figure it may sacrifice quality if they made the product of larger capacity"
5,Mukka Express-BEST COFFEE IN THE WORLD!!!,"If your coffee isnt coming out just perfect, you have perhaps had the heat too high so the water didnt have time to heat slowly and brew the coffee properly. This little cutie of a coffee brewer is the best one I have EVER tried! Best if you leave the top knob up to prevent too much action resulting in spillage. Emily in Houston"
2,missing parts,"Would love to give this new machine a try, however it didn't have all the parts. I even ordered special espresso, so I hope a replacement comes quickly. I think the one I was shipped was previously used. Not happy."
5,Seattle Starbucks drinker gives 5 stars,"Sell your Starbucks stock because this product is amazing! In just 4 quick minutes a delicious frothy cuppucino is ready - and it tastes better than Starbucks!! Forget the bad reviews, if you have half a brain this maker is no problem. Just add water to the line on bottom, scoop in a few teaspoons of espresso, screw on the top, add milk to the line, put it on the stove, wait for the button to pop and your done!"
5,Great for coffee lovers,"I got the Mukka Bialetti cappuccino maker as a gift.Pros: It makes EXCELLENT cappuccino. Note: whole milk does not 'froth' as well as low fat. The taste and quality of the cappuccino is like what you would get in a coffee bar via a professional machine. I assume the quality of the coffee used is a factor, and I'm using good quality bean.Cons: It makes a small amount of cappuccino. Enough for two demitasse small cups, or for one large mug. Also, there are four non-dishwasher-safe parts that have to be cleaned after each use: the lower (water) carafe, the coffee basket, the upper (milk) carafe, and the pressure valve. It's best to clean it right after serving before anything dries to the interior.Even with the drawbacks of small portions and clean-up duties, I would recommend this maker for the great cappuccino it makes via such a small device."
1,No foam yet,"I bought this unit because I was tired of brewing my coffee in a stovetop espresso maker and foaming the milk in a separate pan. Cool, the mukka espress would do it all in one unit.I have yet to get any foam. If I'm doing something wrong I'd like to know what it is.In addition, the beverage that I do end up with, is tepid."
1,terrible product,"It is sad to see these products reaching the market performing so poorly. The valve is almost impossible to take in or out. The two main parts which must be screwed together are a true dilemma. If you screw them tightly unless you are King Kong you won' be able to pull them apart. If you are the slightest timid the coffee will drip all over your range. There are many steps involved. The coffee must be added very carefully. The amount of water is critical. For instance, there is only a 3 ml difference in the amount of water to pour into the main container if you use a gas top versus an electrical range. I can't picture anybody using this coffeemaker more than few times.Big Al"
1,Worthless junk,"Every single time we have used it, it has spilled out all over the stove and made a huge mess. Threw it in the trash eventually. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!!!!!!"
1,Barely works. Way overpriced. Just Awful....,"Even when the directions are followed carefully, it constantly overflows. Unless you like cleaning milk and coffee off your stove, I'd stay away from this one. For the price, I expected much much better. A complete waste of money."
2,Unit returned,"This is a nice tool if you don't have the counter space. BUT...the cappucino consistently comes out too milky for my liking. Also, no matter how tight I screwed the tank and upper piece together (and ensured the gasket was placed properly) the unit always leaked. The button on the button pressure valve (for the milk) did not stay up and was a in a permanent ""botton down"" position for the cappuccino option. It looks like this is a common problem. I had to return the unit for a a standard stovetop espresso maker. At least with one of those I have a perfect espresso to pour into a controlled volume of milk, frothed just the way I like it."
2,Conclusion: Unit returned.,"""Cappuccino is an Italian beverage, prepared with espresso and milk. A cappuccino is generally defined as 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk and 1/3 frothed milk.""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CappuccinoThis is not what you get with the Mukka Express; you get 100% milky coffee after which you scoop out brown frothed milk. Taste is ok; presentation is consistently poor.Now for the bad news, this is a very tricky device to use and requires very special attention in assembling each time you use it. We found that attaching the top to the base, which requires screwing the units together, has a 70-30 chance of success; and with the failures steam and coffee will penetrate the rubber seal and flow unto your stove, resulting in a failed effort and necessary clean up of your stove.Conclusion: Unit returned."
4,Discovered the secret!,After I got my Mukka I had the same problem lots of people had regarding the milk spilling over. I called Bialetti and was helped by a lovely woman who explained to me when that happens often times the stove is set a too high a temperature. I lowered the temporature and voila! Perfection :)
1,Very pricey for the quality,"I purchased this product, ignoring some of the negative reviews on the difficulty of use, etc., assuming that as a well-educated person, I could use it. Hey, I even roast my own coffee beans. I have had the Mukka Express for three years and drag it out periodically, determined to master it. Inevitably I have milk and/or coffee everywhere. I have tried lower heat, higher heat, fastidious cleaning of the gaskets, etc. Nothing works. Save your money. For what you pay for this little pot, it will buy A LOT of coffee from Starbucks!"
4,Great Latte in minutes,This was a great purchase. The mukka express makes a delicious fast cup of cappucino or Latte in minutes.This puchase even came with 2 cups and saucers and a package of expresso
1,Not worth it,"This item does not work. I know people say, well you cannot fill it up to the line, but I tried many times, many different ways, and the product still leaked everywhere. I couldn't even open it once because so much pressure had built up. It's just not worth it."
2,Hard to clean & Expensive,"I received this as a gift and was very excited to get it. I wanted a stovetop espresso maker and this one will do cappuccino too. After using for a while, it became kind of a hassle. If you are used to clean-up of stove top makers, this may be for you. But for the money, I found an Imusa Espresso & cappuccino maker for less than half the price. It cleans up more easily, and makes a better latte (the bialetti doesn't get the milk very hot). The Imusa also makes a quad, again a timesaver. Both machines are fast, and for cappuccino, excellent. But for ease of use, clean up, # of portions, steam control for milk, and of course price; Imusa wins easily."
3,Not Easy to Clean,"I bought this item based on Amazon reviews. After I used it for about one month, here is what I found out so far.Positives:1. good looking.2. better coffee.Negatives:1. painful to clean, especially the cup (the top part). The inner side of the cup is not smooth. After making a cappuccino, the milk is very sticky to the surface. It's so hard to clean it. Plus there is cylinder in the middle of the cup so my hands are hard to get into the cup to clean it. In addition the cup edges are not smoothened and they hurt my hands. I would suggest them to make the inner side smooth. Adding a layer of porcelain would be a good idea.2. After each usage, it's not easy to separate (twist) the top part and bottom part. My wife often asks me for help."
1,"Messy, messy, messy","I could not wait to purchase this item. I love my moring latte's and figured if I skip my afternoon latte for a month (as this is an $89 product), it would be worth it. In any case, I must have gone through at least 1/2 lb. of espresso coffee with no success. I read through all of the previous reviews on every possible site. I tried taking it apart, cleaning every piece. Lowering the flame, etc. To no avail. My stove would be splattered. No matter how tight, how clean, how patient, it was a mess every time. I'm returning it this weekend and will return to using my regular espresso maker and warming up the milk and using my separate frother.My advice ... save your money and wait for the Mukka 2 (we hope) that will fix all these problems."
2,Great foam - weak coffee,I found this product easy to use. It produced great foam and made coffee quickly. Only trouble was no matter what I tried the coffee was always weak and tasted a little like dishwater. Even with good ground espresso. I am currently making espresso with a traditional machine and using a $5 aerator for foam.
3,a complete mess,"as other reviewers have stated, WHEN this product works as its supposed to, it does make a great cappuccino. but more than half the time, the unit leaks all over the stove, leaving a mess and a strong smell of burnt coffee. half the time i have to re-do the process and start over again from scratch. the froth and coffee also tends to suddenly erupt, leaving another mess and a burn risk if you dont pour it into a cup the second its ready. it cannot be left unattended. i cannot believe this product passed any tests. its a fire hazard, a burn hazard and makes my kitchen a mess. its just not worth the stress!"
2,cute but a mess,I was so disappointed with this product. It doesn't screw closed correctly and the leaking coffee got progressively worse. This leaked so bad the last time I used it that I had to take my stove burners apart and clean them. Definitely not worth the $$$$.
1,don't buy - thought it was good too but already broken,"I read the reviews and since it received (on average) about 4 stars, i thought i would buy it. i did and i probably would have given equally positive reviews when i first used it (even a few weeks after receiving it). it's stylish; it's fun to use (in a weird, european kinda way).now, it's already broken and doesn't work. the problems i have with this item are very consistent with what i have read from the few negative reviews of people who didn't just jump to write a review, used it for a while and now experience problems.again, i would have given it a very positive review when i first got it so i would be curious to see how long the folks who gave it positive reviews had the item.i've had mine for less than two months and now would not recommend anyone to buy this item."
3,"Good Cappuccino, Frustrating to use","Wow - I got this for my birthday and I've followed the instructions veeerrrry carefully, and most of the time it makes really excellent cappuccino. I recommend good quality grounds, like Illy Dark/Fine ground. Some MAJOR problems, though: It is so, so difficult to screw the bottom and top halves together. It's metal on metal threads, and it can take as long as five full frustrating minutes to get it on right. And woe to thee if you do it wrong- as other reviews have said, the coffee leaks out everywhere, all over your stove. Awful. This product must also be meticulously hand cleaned each time, no dishwashing. The frustration is causing me to not use this thing much."
2,disappointed,"I made a few really good pots, but have had more total messes, and I have been extremely careful. Although the process is not at all difficult, it must be very finnicky.I have had water and coffee leaks all over my stove- perhaps a tiny ground of esspresso prevented the proper seal.After reading the trouble-shooting tips I was extra sure not to overfill the coffee resevoir and to clean the area, just in case.No luck.It was nice when it worked, but I will sadly go back to my grind 'n brew."
4,Wonderful cappuccino,"I have now had the Bialetti Mukka Express for several years. One reviewer had commented that there is a learning curve, and that is exactly what I experienced. The first couple of times, it spewed coffee all over my stove like a volcano. A few times it kept leaking at the seal. But after awhile, I figured out how to tighten it just right so it (almost) never leaks. A few times the milk has not frothed, but I believe that is user error. The valve should probably be cleaned in warm water pretty quick after making a pot, otherwise the milk gums it up and then it's harder to clean. So I have wonderful cappuccino about 3 times a week, alternating with my completely foolproof, VERY-easy-to-use french press."
3,Odd little pot,Bought really for camping. Very useful tips from reviewers here. Been using it about 5 times a week trying to get in the zone for camping. Other pot is a Saeco Super Automatic. Fun to use tho. Tough to get really jazzed about the clean up compared to the easy other one. Quality of beverage? Acceptable. I can see if your favorite cap is from Charred-to-Bucks how this is one to rave about tho. I'll make it as a Cap instead of a latte as the lattes are extra watery. Works the same w/ soy or whole milk.
5,Fun to use!,"This espresso/latte/cappuccino maker is really fun to use. It isn't the best Cappuccino ever made, but is as good as a stovetop can get! It is a little tricky, so read all the instructions through and you will have no problems."
5,"Good product, very satisfied with it so far","I purchased it about two months ago, it works very well, extremely easy to use and clean. Make sure you use coffee for espresso machines. It always makes a nice foamy cappuccino. It has no frills but is fun and easy to use."
1,Dangerous!,"I have been using the Mukka Express for about two month now. When it works, it works great. Sometimes, however, the coffee doesn't come through at all and I'm pouring a cup of hot milk into my cup. Sometimes it explodes and starts pouring all over my stove. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why this is happening. I'm doing everything according to the video instructions. This morning the hot milk was just pouring out of the spout. No foam, just a fountain of scalding hot milk. This product is dangerous and makes a mess. I wish I could get my $ back!"
4,Great little machine,"Almost every pot of coffee I've made with the Mukka has been perfect. There was one incident of overflowing, as some reviewers described, but this was due to user error. For better or worse, this coffee pot requires that the directions be followed exactly- there is little room for error. As other reviewers have stated, I have gotten the best results by doing the following:*Fill the water and milk exactly to their respective lines- do not overfill.*Make sure there are no coffee grounds on the rim of the basket before screwing on the top of the coffee maker.*Always keep the stove on a low heat setting. The few times I tried using a medium setting, the pot overflowed.*Clean, or at least soak the pot immediately after emptying to avoid gumming up the valve.Enjoy!"
3,Patient User of the Mukka,"I have had this product for four months now, every morning I drink my capuccino, only I get capuccino's every other time, then every 2 or 3 times I have to run vinegar to unclog the pressure valve. It has stopped leaking for the most part from the middle, but now the valve doesn't push pressure through anymore, I have no idea why, maybe the vinegar killed it. I will replace the valve because I refuse to buy a 2000 dollars capuccino maker, but yes the milk doesn't warm enough when the valve breaks and you set the valve for capuccino, yes it leaks when it is not screwed correctly. Now it only makes nice lattes. But I won't give up that easy ... not yet."
5,Perfect every time (after a few tries)!,"If you use it right, the Mukka makes perfect Cappuccino every time! It is very easy to use. It takes a few tries to get it down, as the instructions are less than stellar. Here are some tips to help:- use cold water- fill the milk above the line marked if you want a good amount of froth, just submerging the nozzle - don't overfill!- use semi-skimmed or 2% milk, not whole milk- wait for the gurgling sounds to stop before you remove from the heatGood luck!"
2,Coffee leaks out and makes a mess,"I have used a lot of different stove top espresso makers over the years, and I was very excited to see one that actually claimed to make a frothy cappuccino. I went out and bought it the next day! However, I was dismayed to find that all the coffee leaked out of the seal between the top and lower units. I thought I must have done something wrong, so I went back and read the directions and made sure that I screwed the top and bottom together tightly and that there were no coffee grounds impeding the gasket seal (that last step is a pain in and of itself). I have officially made 8 pots of coffee and I have been partially successful only two times but made a total mess of my stove top every single time. Now that I have gone through over $10 in coffee, I have concluded that this thing is a total bust as far as I am concerned. That is disappointing as I *really* wanted it to work."
5,give it time,We LOVE this machine. I haven't been to Starbucks since I received it as a gift. It paid for itself in weeks! It does take a little practice- make sure you don't leave grounds on the rim and we found that heating the milk for one minute in the microwave gives us a hotter end product. I too wish it had a four cup capacity but you can brew a second batch immediately after the first. We have enjoyed experimenting with custom blends of coffees. I am buying this for all my Starbuck addict family for Christmas. This makes a cappuccino that rivals any coffee house!
3,good coffee,"Makes good coffee but does not work properly,parts are not made exellent.I have returned twice.In general product is good.I do like it."
1,cappupccino bomb,"I excitedly ordered this cappuccio maker for my husband after reading about it in a magazine where the chef said it was his one go-to item in his kitchen. My husband read all the instructions and prepared the most delicious cappuccino EVER--the first time. After that, it never worked properly again. I returned the product."
5,YUM,Ok. So the directions are pretty good and pictures are easy to read. It says to make 3 servings of it and toss it out but .. I made one and drank it hehe. The first cup I made was cappuccino. It came out perfect! Nice and foamy and smooth. I flavored mine with Torani Vanilla Syrup. I added 1 Tbl spoon per cup. Came out perfect. I'll be saving me 3 bucks and change on coffee everyday (starbucks).
1,"Product falls short, did not work as expected, not worth $80+","My wife and I are avid coffee drinkers. No Folgers crystals in our house. We bought this device from a non-Amazon, national kitchenware retailer for $75. We thought it would be a good 'add' to our coffee gear, my wife like the cow print. Boy, were we disappointed. We used it once and returned it.1) it was cumbersome to use, the directions were not clear.2) It simply does not do what it claims to be able to do. It barely made 1 cup much less 2.Before you drop $75-$80+ on this thing, do a hard think. In our opinion the value proposition is just not there."
4,I got it to stop leaking from the middle by...,"When I first used it, it leaked from the center every time. All I could think was that no way Chuck Williams would have this thing sputtering all over his stove and thought seriously of returning it to Williams-Sonoma. Then I tried lowering the amount of espresso grounds I used in it and voilá it works! I use about two rounded spoonfuls of Illy espresso fine grind.I have a gas stove and set it to medium, I use either half & half or cream (in smaller quantities than one would use milk - careful not to let it boil over)and I let it stay on the burner a bit longer because I like it extra hot. I've also added sugar-free flavor syrups to the half & half with no problem.This was a frustrating process, but worth it."
4,I'm an expert and I say this is great,"Really, I am an expert on this subject. I have a restaurant quality espresso machine at home, roast my own beans, and know good coffee when I drink it. This device is amazing, and almost foolproof. You see from other reviewers that it isn't entirely foolproof, but if you actually follow the simple directions, it works every time for me. The biggest difference between this capp and pro-machine capp is that the foam and the coffee are one---meaning, the foam is not white, but the color of coffee. Still, it makes a nice rich foam, not quite as rich as I can with a proper machine. But for 89 dollars, a moment of time, a moment to clean----this is really great, and a brilliant invention. Make sure you use good coffee---Illy is the best in a can, but many local roasters can do better and fresher."
4,Makes yummy cappuccino,"So far, I've used my Mukka Express (""cow"" version) nearly every day for ~1 1/2 months, and it has consistently yielded delicious cappuccino. I've tried this with both soy milk & 1%, & it's great, although I find it froths better with 1%. My cappuccino tastes & looks like the real thing - which is amazing considering it takes less than 5 minutes to prepare on a regular electrical stovetop. Cleaning the unit is no big deal either - I do it right away since it gets more difficult as the milk dries in the upper chamber. ***The only caveat to this product is that the cappuccino comes out lukewarm.*** So, I have to nuke my cup each time. Other than that, I love my Mukka Express & recommend it!"
1,"Great idea, but could not get it to work. Hot water everywhere!","I really wanted this to work; it was a much-desired wedding gift. But every time I tried to use it, the same thing happened... hot grounds and water went all over the stovetop. I tried to do everything right; I tried to make sure the gaskets made a tight seal, I didn't fill up the machine with too much water or coffee grounds... but now I give up."
1,What a mess this makes,"Do not buy this product unless you are really looking for something to do in the mornings. I feel like I've ground $100 up in the garbage disposal with the used coffee grinds. I am college-educated, very analytical and meticulous in reading and following directions, but I can not get this device to work more than 1/3 of the time. It leaks all over the stove top creating a mess and stink of burnt coffee. Imagine dealing with this at 6:30 or 7:00 in the morning before work. I have tried every remedy from reducing the heat intensity, using less coffee in the filter basket, cleaning the gasket/seal every time and nothing corrects the problem. When I contacted the distributor from whom I bought the product, they would not let me return it for a refund but did exchange it for another -- no improvement at all. I've now wasted a second 1/2 pound of coffee and am back to stopping at Starbucks for my morning cappuchino."
4,Love the Mukka Express,This easy-to-use device makes excellent cappuccinos. The instructions are much more intimidating then the actual use of the machine. Thanks to Mukka Express I have cappuccinos every morning with uber frothy milk. Well worth the money!
3,I really want to like it...,"I got this a few weeks ago, and like most other reviews, had troubles (overflowing, no foam, couldn't get the parts together correctly). But then, it all came together and I made a couple of really good tasting cappucinos with perfect foam. For some unknown reason though, it stopped working again - the cappucino tastes watery even though I am sure I am using the same amt. as before, and the foam production happens a lot faster than before, giving me watery foam that dissappears. I am thinking about buying a replacement valve, as I think my problem has to do with that part. Has anyone tried that, has it helped?"
4,"Very good book, but I would like to see a new edition","Very good book, but I would like to see a new edition with better paper, graphic artwork and photos. The first time I saw this book here in Italy was in the early 90's and I decided to buy it but I didn't have the money that day, then the following week I didn't find it anymore in the shop. Some 15 years have passed and in my brain this missing book had remained as an alert, and eventually I bought it on Amazon. Very good book that explains the real story of this funny and beloved old cat... I highly recommend this book to everybody."
5,The Best Handling Guide Ever,"This is a great book! It has really helped me.I am a Junior Handler in shows, but I don't yet have a dog, so I show other peoples dogs.I really enjoyed reading this book. It has so many helpful tips and pointers. I read it before I go to bed, and I also practice my ring procedures with a stuffed dog.This book has done so much for me. So, if you are new to dog shows, like I am, this is definately the book for you. I would recomend this to newcomers, like myself.After reading this, I attended my 5th show. I came in first and that was all I needed to make it to the Junior Nationals, where I placed first.Read this book. If it can help me, it can help you too!"
4,Good For the Beginning Handler,"This book is a really good introduction to dog shows, especially since you will understand it if you've never even been to a show. There is a section about how to stack, gait, and bait the dog with diagrams and photos. Coile is very precise, and most of the information you will find in this book will come in handy in the showring."
5,The Oxford Dictionary of Scientific Quotations,"This title delivers scientists' quotations that not only sum up the writer's life work but also epitomize their belief systems and rationale for doing their work, even on a higher level. Masterful selection of writers and their quotations. Open anywhere, and read! Makes an inspiring gift.--Jinna"
5,Honey Bunn Loves It!!!,"My little hamster just loves it!!! The wheel was too small and she liked her old wood house better than the plastic, but that was really easy to fix. The water bottle that comes with it is great and she loves to go through the tubes and loves the little ""basement"", she feels very safe there aways from the cats. I highly recommend it!"
4,Almost there,"While it appears I was one of the few people who actually enjoyed Chris' first solo album, this one is much better. This album has a better contextual feel and opens with a great track (40 days).This release makes for good driving music, weaving in and out of blues and rock, refusing to be pushed into a certain musical box. The arrangement is good and there is a solid flow to the whole thing.While I do enjoy this album, I still feel that Chris has more in him, that he still hasn't hit one completely out of the park yet. Now that he has gotten back together with Rich for a few shows in NY, it will be interesting to see what kind of effect that has on him and his writing.One other note...the album cover could have been a lot better. But if that's the worst I can say about an album, that's pretty good."
5,A Must Buy For Crowes Fans!!,"If you have the true Crowes bug, you will love it. I was suprised to find out how much I actually like it. It is an alternative to a more calmer side of chris. Like the Crowes it will grow on you and than you won't be able to shake it. It is worth the buy."
5,Wonderful,"A very beautiful cd. Don't believe what some brain-dead bi ""jello shooter"" from MA writes. Obviously someone isn't the ""sharpest knife in the drawer."""
2,too long and to slow,"chris robinsons second album was a huge dissapointment. I loved his first album and was anticipating the second until I heard it. It is 67 minutes long and I swear to god if you have one hour to live listen to this album because it seems like it lasts an eternity. its slow and boring and goes nowhere. He needs a guy to fully produce his album not just a couple of tracks. I love ethan johns and his work with ryan adams, and the jayhawks but even he couldn't save this piece. Please god let the black crowes get back together because I need some rock. I guess I 'm a little jaded but listen to it and thank me for my opinion."
2,Eh,"I ain't a NEM fan, but I keep trying! It sucks that Chris' stuff just doesn't move me, but I guess that's the way it is...What the hell is Swamp Theater?I think I'm talking to myself since it's now Saturday, and we won't see chubbs for another week, prolly...~Foxy~"
5,Girl on the mountain.,"Chris Robinson has touched on where I want my music to go with this song.Excellent song, and an even better better album than the first, but everyone else here has said that already! A must for CR and Black Crowes fans.Another MUST OWN!"
4,Keeper of the flame...,"I always admired Chris and the Crowes for the no-nonsense approach to their music and the industry. Robinsons second solo release is a throwback to the days when you bought a album (yes a album, those 12"" vinyl things) for all the songs. A great Sunday morning disc to put on and relax too. ""Tumbleweed in Eden"" is fantastic, as is ""40 Days"" and ""Train Robbers"" Looking forward to seeing New Earth Mud opening for the Allmans in a few weeks. A great CD, pick it up, give it a listen or two, and enjoy."
5,Everybody Twist!,"This little gem of a movie will take you back to the ""twistin"" sixties. All of the songs (with the exception of the Marcel's Merry Twistmas) are fun to listen to. Sure, its a lame movie but hey, it sure brought back memories for me! Vicki Spencer was a good singer - especially ""He's So Sweet"". I would like to see this available in DVD format - hey, why not a CD of the music. Anybody able to make that happen?"
4,A Real Collector for the Future,"This toy is a good collector but is fun for the little ones. I would consider it to be a real money maker when they get older.In 15 years this thing could be worth $1,000. It will be less if taken out of the box. So you might as well buy two will their cheap.In 30 year it could triple that amount or even more. So buy them while you can."
3,Changed Color,I haven't bought this product in a couple of years (was still using an old tube) but thought I should update. The new product is a terrible reddish dark color! I try to think whose complexion it would work on and can't think of anyone! (I have a very average medium skin tone) I definitely can't wear this in public which defeats the purpose of the tint. Very disappointing...
2,Awful stuff,"I put it on in small amounts, and by the end of the day my face was red from it. I don't reccomend it."
1,As it was,"Once you have read ""The Third Eye"" you wont want to read this.Alot of repetition and its an old old book taken from some long forgotten warehouse and charging a high price !"
5,Perfect CD for a long drive,"Even though none of the cuts are by Royksopp per se, the cumulative feel of the CD itself is very Royksoppian and equally delightful to the ears. I recently had the pleasure of enjoying this entry into the ""Back To Mine"" series during a long road trip through the Pacific Northwest. While it was playing, I was in bliss. The boredom of driving was erased with a smile on my face during every moment it was playing. What a perfect CD for the road."
4,"Not For Play, But A Solid Showcase Figurine","A great, little showcase piece crafted in the image of the original from the 1995 film, not the more current TV show. Set up takes a few minutes, and is very simple. The effect is quite cool, actually, with the figurine appearing to be suspended in mid-air. The limbs move at odd angles to provide you with a range of interesting poses. Not for kids who want to play or have their action figure interact with one another in elaborate battles (you remember when you launched sieges with GI-Joes, don't give me that look). Rather perfect for the comic book and film geek (like myself) who simply wants to buy it, set it up, and leave it out as a display item. For $5, it's a steal."
5,It is not really a toy as much it's really an display figure.,"Great display figure for fans of ghost and the shell, and for those who are serious fans this figure is acctually modeled after the orginal ghost in the shell movie."
2,Video is very ameturish...,"This video (and its companion piece ""Last Poets Interview"") is very poorly done. I own both VHS tapes and they are THE SAME FOOTAGE! The sound quality is very disgusting, whomever filmed and recorded the interview did a piss-poor job. The camera stays on Ole-Woye more than Umar Bin Hassan, and you can't even hear what Umar says when interviewed!These are VERY neophyte and ameturish in production and quality. I wasted my money purchasing these tapes. I met the Last Poets when they came to Sacramento, CA and they are cool, down to earth people. I'm sorry that these videos are out in the public, it does them a great disservice.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!"
2,Textbook accurate,"I expect more from a Deutsche Grammophone label.My standards are too high as a result.At the most, the playing would score high on a piano exam but not to classical music conoisseurs."
5,Great debut,"Cole's playing is technically sound and her rubato is sufficiently restrained yet her playing is quite emotional without going overboard. I think the selection of French composers suits her playing style well. Her version of the Satie Gymnopedie is the slowest one I've heard and it elicits a stronger sense of longing and rememberence than the others. If I had to describe her playing, it would be like taking in a long breath on a meadow after the first spring rain. I highly recommend this cd and I really look forward to future works by Nadia."
3,Ok,"This CD is ok, but I am use to listening to the great recordings of the Gaspard by Argerich and Pogorelich. I would recommend this CD only for the lesser known works of Chabrier and Faure."
4,Paz may have broke his ice,This CD from Fransisco Paz is delightfully put togehter... It's a collection that can be shared internationally because it omits lyrics and instead romances us with a dazzling collection of piano and other instrumental pieces. I have not heard any of Paz' other works that come close to Andrea.
3,NIKTO,I agree with most of the reveiws not a lot of posibility but still fun. Dont worry about taking the robe off its a waste of time. But over all a good toy.
4,grindiing and polishing,A wet dry sanding pad which I use to shine up stainless steel pots and pans when I burn them. It does the job.
2,Jusst highlights? *sigh*,I just wish they could just get the music licensing issues handled so that they could release the series in it's entirety. All the highlights and commentary can't express the impact of actually seeing the full programs.I'll skip this and wait for the real thing.
3,PBS Missed Opportunity.....,"Awhile ago I reviewed a VHS recorded edition of ""An American Family,"" the first true reality TV show featuring the Loud family of Santa Barbara, CA circa 1971. A remarkable documentary, but those who think they are getting the entire series on one DVD are sorely mistaken; bear in mind this is strictly a documentary on the series and the work of Craig Gilbert, the series director, and an overview with highlights from the show running approximately 95 minutes.Nonetheless, for the uninitiated to the series, it is still a worthy foray into the show with some engaging interviews and background into the show, its historical significance, and its impact on reality television to this day. For more information about the series itself, please check my review on ""An American Family""--a plea to the powers that be at PBS or elsewhere to transfer this seminal television artifact to DVD for all to enjoy."
2,wait for the series to come out,patchwork quilt attempt to squeeze an entire series that played over many episodes. very disappointed in the editorial choices that were made.
2,American Family DVD,"I was disappointed in this DVD as I expected the original series, not snippets and ""after the fact"" scenes. Apparently the original mini-series was never recorded and this is all that was ever taped."
5,One of the Saga's Greatest,"First and for most I have to say that this is by far one of the best figures out there. Since I am a collector I know a lot about 'good' figures. If you're a collector like me, I would suggest getting this figure as soon as possible because this figure is very rare and hard to find. The articulation is amazing on this toy which surprises me very much. This toy is also heavy compared to the other Saga Figures. Ephant Mon is also very cool looking and scary. For those who aren't collectors, this looks just like every other toy. I wouldn't suggest getting this figure for someone who has no idea what Star Wars is all about. Ephant Mon is Jabba's Head of Security in which he isn't even mentioned in the movie. Ephant Mon isn't a major character, so I would recommend getting either Count Dooky or Yoda because of their popularity. Hope you enjoy this figure."
5,Funny and Frightening,"If you haven't read any book by this author yet, I recommend you start with these short story collection. It took me a while to become familira with the African names, style of dialogue and the titles and traditions, but after I got used to it, everything fell in place.I finally liked his style of writing, especially the messages behind the stories.My favourite was the title story.I never liked Jacob because he was without scruples, still I sympathized with him after he lost the throne and ties to the royal family. The exciting part of reading his work is that the stories are interconnected.Overall, ihis is a very good collection of stories."
4,So hilarious,"These stories are so originally African. They are written with grace and are so funny. I am moved by the wisdom in them, the true to life situations and the vividness of the characters."
5,Gazza magic,"A brutelly honest biography from one of the World's greatest players! He tells of the highs and the lows of what has been a turbulant life! It brings out the sensitive side of the man, the player, the one Paul Gascoigne! He brings over his side to it all very well. The vulnerable side of the show-man is strong, a fantastic insight to the life of a true legend!"
4,"Cozy, comfy","This is a warm and fuzzy scarf, which has done a good job of keeping my neck warm. There's nothing all that spectacular about it (just a scarf with a flag on it, so I'm glad it wasn't expensive) but it's a cute little way of being patriotic!"
1,Unplayable,I am unable to view the DVD. The DVD is full of bad sectors and is almost entirely unplayable. Do not buy unless you enjoy spending money for junk.
3,Silk Shirt,Retruned this item. Well made. But I thought it would have more of a JKT appearance to it.
4,The Next Generation of Zydeco,"Brad Paul Frank is the up-and-coming youngest performing member of the Frank zydeco dynasty from Soileau, Louisiana. He is the nineteen year old son of Preston Frank, and brother of Keith Frank. He was the drummer in Keith Frank's Soileau Zydeco Band, and is now an excellent accordion player and front-man for his own band. With his first solo recording, he steps out front with accordion, as well as handling keyboards and vocals. This offers eleven tracks in nouveau zydeco style: funky, danceable, rhythmic groove patterns on a diatonic single-row accordion, double-beat bass and drums, an urban feel spicing up a country flavor."
3,Here They Come Again!,"The '72 release `Return of the Blind Dead' is writer/director Amando de Ossorio's second installment in the ""Blind Dead"" series. While many consider this to be an improvement on the first film, I personally think the first was the superior of the two. While the overall scope of the second is larger I find the mood and atmosphere of the first to be more compelling and evocative. Maybe it's just a case of what's done the first time is done the best. Anyway, for those of you who like the unnerving moaning and slow-motion specters here they come again!"
2,Those Wacky Spaniards,"De Ossario really tries, but his horror films always look like the work of an eighth-grader who has just borrowed his father's cam-corder one Saturday afternoon. The Knights Templar rise from the grave in this sequel to Tombs of the Blind Dead, and they run amok in sort of a mild way in some small crappy town. Sex is always about to happen in this film, but never does. People are always about to be killed, but that never quite happens either. Before you know it, you've just wasted two hours of your life that you'll never get back."
2,More Blind Numbness,"This superior inferiority to the original dumb ""Blind Dead"" movie is another trash bin waste. So many people have hyped up these films that I can't believe what they say about it. Since I was a kid I have heard about how scary and great these films are and I saw them all and was throughly disappointed, was everyone on drugs, from the 1970's or do they just not know how boring this crude is?"
4,A little long,"Marvel's account is pretty much all you have to turn to if you want to read about the infamous Burnside. The author tries his hardest to present Burnside in a favorable light, going so far as to claim he could have won at Fredericksburg if not for the slowness of General Franklin. Marvel's contentions about Burnside's competency are at best debatable. As noted elsewhere, there is very little here about Burnside's early life (perhaps due to lack of source material), and less understandably, little is included about his post-war political career.I feel the book was a bit long, going into great detail about situations where Burnside's subordinates were preforming some maneuver in New Berne or East Tennessee. The book could have been edited down by a hundred pages or so.There also a lack of the voice of the subject. Very few letters seem to exist from Burnside, so it is hard to get to know him outside the limits of his official communications."
4,HOPE TO HAVE IT AGAIN,I used to have this album on a cassette. Have no idea where it is but I loved it. Would love to find it on a CD format.
1,THE TRUTH EXPOSED!!!,"HE DOESN'T STAND UP!HE JUST FALLS DOWN!ONLY HAVE HIM FOR A ""DEAD""SCENE.5 STARS FOR ""EDUCATIONAL"" BECAUSE IT TEACHES SEVERAL THINGS;NEVER BUY A FIGURE(NOT ACTION)MADE OF !!!RUBBER!!!;DONT TRUST SOMETHING WITH ""BATTLE DAMAGE"" OR THE HIGHLIGT OF THE TOY IS ""HOLDS GUN IN BOTH HANDS!""(IT IS ON THE BACK)OTHERS I HAVE:(SO FAR)1 JANGO FETT:FINAL BATTLE2 ""RED"" CLONE3 SUPER BATTLE DROID (GOT THIS BY RETURNING REG DROID)"
5,battle droid that doesn't stink despite what you guys say!,"Okay, first of all, his legs are made of nice FIRM plastic, not ""rubber"". Secondly, he stands up very EASILY, and his gun fits perfectly in his hands; his head doesn't come off with a touch. That's why he has a clear elastic band to keep his head in place. Lastly, he has nice detachable electrical energy that can be wrapped around other action figures. This figure is a GOOD toy, not a lousy one. P.S. He has a really nice backpack that has a slot that you can fit his gun into."
3,Realistic But Boring Droid,"This figure is as about as realistic as possible, but it feels rather flimsy and doesn't come with very many flexible joints. The head falls of with a light touch and usually has to lean against something to stand. It can only hold its realistic weapon in one position and don't touch it, or else it will fall off."
1,Very flimsy. Worst of the bunch.,"The legs are a very ""gooey"" plastic that are usually deformed when you remove the figure from the package. It's very hard to straighten the legs out and make the figure stand up for display purposes."
3,Early Piper; interesting to see a non-SF novel of his.,"Murder in the Gunroom is an early work of H. Beam Piper's. It ties into his hobby of gun collecting, and the knowledge exhibited in the novel is so substantial it is obviously second nature to him. As murder mysteries go, it's ho-hum. Piper was still finding his voice when he wrote this, and it shows. I found his characters rather wooden, a common enough phenomenon of early works. It's a problem that clears up with experience.I bought this novel because of the author. I've read most of his science fiction, and I was curious as to how he wrote in a different genre. He isn't Dashiel Hammet or Mickey Spillane, that is sure; but had he persisted in murder mysteries, I am sure he'd have become a solid, readable mystery writer.Still, when all is said and done, I much prefer his science fiction to his take on the mystery novel. This may be of value to a completist, but it is not something I'd recommend to a friend who likes murder mysteries."
3,H Beam Piper's Only Mystery,"Piper was a pretty good writer, even here at the start of his career. The characters aren't too well developed, but they work. The details of collectible pistols are good, but the prices of the time will make you weep!"
4,Excellent book,"I have read well over 15 books in the last year on the history of Harley Davidson. This book in particular broke the mold in comparision to the others because the author went over and above the call of duty in his research. Rather than simply recite the corporate timeline and Harley's non-asscociation with outlaw biker gangs, Wright chose to speculate on some very real issues facing the Motor Company today. Problems like an aging customer base, continued invasion from foreign manufacturers and a strong emphasis on where the company must set it's sights in order to overcome these issues.Besides that he actually speaks in detail about everyone's greatest fear-the retirement of Willie G. The rest as they say is history. Definately a great read. If you're like me and have read a great deal of books of this nature, then you will truly appreciate this book. Throughout my time spent, I probably only didn't read a total of 10 pages of the entire book. Enjoy!"
4,Just like Daddy's,"I bought this dart board for my 4 year old daughter who always wanted to play with her Daddy's real dart board, but for obvious reasons was not aloud. This was a Christmas gift and she was thrilled to have a dart board ""just like Daddy's"" that she could play with. She loves it. The darts always stick to the board as the magnets are pretty strong."
2,Difficult to Play,"The entire game board is made out of a hard plastic so there is no give at all. Almost every dart bounces around the scoring area after impact. After just a few throws, I was considering re-wrapping the game for a white elephant party when one of the feathers broke off a dart. I do not recommend this product for players of any age."
4,Taun We,"in the movie, Taun We is one of my favorite characters. The problem with the figure is that one leg is longer than the other. this may onnly apply to mine, but it is almost impossible to stand up with this defect. It could be a little taller, but it is pretty well scaled. It is fun to move around her long arms and it is very detailed and looks just like the character. the ""clone chamber"" is pointless, it doesn't do anything and its not very cool looking. I would still buy this figure if your willing to deal with these defects."
1,too educational,"i was really dissapointed with this figure.clone chamber could do with a human embryo inside.educational references to the human body,cloning and space.not very durable.sinks in water falls over in sand.legs are awful.worst episode 2 toy so far.don't buy."
5,Food and drink for the Soul,"Cecilia Bartoli possesses a unique combination of beauty of voice, vocal technique, and musical knowledge. Although sometimes her intensity may strike a newer listener as ""over-the-top"", I found it very much in character for each and every piece that she sings. It is not often that a singer puts as much of herself into the character she is portraying as Ms Bartoli does. One reviewer mentions her ""aspirations"" on some rapid passages. In my experience, this is a style and method appropriate for many Italian composers. Ms Bartoli doesn't use this style when singing Mozart or Haydn, for example.In this album Cecilia treats us to works of Vivaldi that are seldom performed. And the supporting orchestral ensemble, Il Giardino Armonico, performing on authentic period instruments, simply could not be improved upon. The overwhelming enthusiasm of the Parisian audience was well-deserved!"
3,"A thrilling trapeze act, but just how much do you want?","Having followed La Bartoli's spectacular rise as operatic superstar from the beginning, I rushed out to buy this recording the moment it hit the shops. Within twenty minutes of listening I seriously wished we were back in the old days of 78s, because, as thrilling as her vocal acrobatics are, it starts taking on a same-ishness after two or three arias. Towards the end of the disc I found myself laughing out loud at the sheer excess of it all. The problem for me is that there is not enough variety in Vivaldi's music and, try as she may, Bartoli cannot find depth in what remain rather empty show-pieces for a phenomenal technique. Even the most preposterous of Mozaert's concert arias (""Popoli di Tessaglia"" comes to mind) there is a sense of purpose and drama which I find lacking in this music. A superb effort, then from soliost and orchestra alike, but best experienced in small doses."
5,This is Vivaldi!,"This recording clearly shows how important the ARTIST is when it comes to performing the music of Vivaldi. If you present the music with energy and fantasy it won't become dull. The reason to all the negative talk about Vivaldi being a bad composer is really that the musicians until recently, never have had the right approach to the music. I love this record and I must give Il Giardino extra credit for there superb playing. This is a must-have!"
5,You will be enlightened....,"This is one of the few recordings that like Glen Gould's Goldberg's Variations in 1955 that stunned the music world. Cecilia Bartoli is communicating directly with listeners: about love, about death, about loss, about joy - all human needs and pains are here as for the first time. Hers is not only the superb voice, hers is a gift of her soul. It shocks again and again. How often do we need to be shaken so? She thinks every time we listen to her voice!This CD is a sensation!"
2,"Great music, but disappointment","I thoroughly enjoy classical music but found this cd to be a disappointment by a heavy vocal performance. It was shocking to hear the heaviness and darkness in Cecilia's voice, whom I had remembered to be lighter and more playful. My only good thought about this cd is ""At least it was a gift"" because if I had actually purchased it I would be thoroughly disgusted."
3,Flimsy,This might work fine for thin iPod head phone wires bit is too flimsy to hold a phone charger wire which is what I intended.
3,Bood book but not good printing,It is a pity that a good photographic material is loost in a deficient printing. The paper is porous and it make photos look dim.
3,Warning - Beware- Warning This set will lock up on you,"This is a wonderful monitor. Excellent picture quality and very good value, but you can be sure that the set will lock up at least twice a week. Then you'll have to unplug it from the power outlet and re-plug it. I called Westinghouse and they said to plug it into a UPS. I bought a $129.00 UPS with automatic voltage regulator and the monitor is the only thing plugged into the UPS. It still locks up. Now Westinghouse is saying to unplug it and leave it unplugged for at least five minutes to see if the problem resolves itself. Let's see.If you don't mind paying $2,000.00 for a monitor that needs to be unplugged a couple of times a week to be used, then this is a good buy. Beware, however.I wonder what long term repercusions will there be from having to regularly unplug the set."
2,Wonderful TV - HORRIBLE customer service,"I bought this TV because you could not beat the price for what you get. The picture is incredible. That is where the 2 stars come from. However, I would not have bought this TV if I had known how awful it would be if there was a problem! I have been back and forth with the company about having someone come out to fix it for 4 MONTHS and they are still giving me the run around. By the time they come, the warranty will have expired and I think that is the point!Someone from customer service actually told me that they have no control over the repair service that THEY hire to fix their products! Last time I called they said I should send it (at my expense and I live on the east coast) to California so they can fix it. Sure.If you still want to buy the TV, get an extended warranty from the store because Westinghouse does not seem to want to honor theirs."
4,Future Proof Bargain,"I bought this monitor after looking at LCD and Plasma TVs that were twice the price yet had inferior picture quality. The picture is excellent - bright, vivid colors, good contrast, and amazing detail. The fact that this has no TV tuner doesn't matter if you use cable. The speaker system is weak and yes, the remote is cheap, but for well under $2k this is a future-proof bargain with 1080p true HDTV capabilities. In other words, when High Def. DVDs become common, this monitor will display them at their best."
4,Very Nice LCD,"I've owned this monitor for a couple of weeks now and I'm very satisfied so far. The picture quality is stunning - no dead pixels, great color, high brightness, etc. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the monitor responds sluggishly to the remote control. Since the unit does not have a built in TV tuner, the remote control really doesn't need numbered buttons either but it has them anyway. There have also been a couple of instances where the monitor did not pick up the input signals and stayed in standby (dark) mode. However, I haven't seen it do this after I decided not to turn the monitor off but just let it go into sleep mode by itself. If you get one, I think you'll be very happy, especially at the recently reduced price."
3,Good pictures. Poor remote control. No closed caption,"plus:- Good pictures. Cannot tell difference from Sony- Good price- Three inputs for computer, and looks very good when using as computer monitor- Ok speakers.minus:- Poor remote control. Has to point exactly to the spot- No closed caption"
1,Horrible Build Quality,"Bought the TV because it was one of the cheapest 1080p units around at the time. But I've realized you get what you paid for. First, the HDMI is horrible, it makes my PS3 signal flash uncontrollably. There's also no dedicated HDMI button on the controller; it cycles between 3 DVI/HDMI modes. That means it won't work properly with my Logitech 880 remote. Then, my first unit failed on me with a screen problem.Long story short, I got 2 separate replacements, and they were both refurb units in worse condition than my original box, and both failed (the first one was dead on arrival with a broken speaker and messed-up colors, which means they didn't even test the thing before shooting it out the door). The second box failed about 2 months out of warranty, so I'm stuck with a $1500 piece of junk. Suffice it to say I'm never buying Westinghouse ever again."
5,EXCELLENT HD LCD TV for the price... I have one question though...,"This is a GREAT HD LCD TV for the price. The colors are dead on and SO many inputs to choose from! 1080p ROCKS!!Two knocks and a question though....1. As stated before, the remote has weak features (like having 8 dedicated buttons for choosing inputs, yet no PIP features like swap or PbP changing).2. The manual is about as skimpy as they get. Minimal information, but just enough to not make it a huge problem.My question is, does anyone know how to take the stand off so you can mount this puppy? The manual say NOTHING about mounting, but the VESA mounting holes are clearly on the spine of the monitor.If you're looking to buy a 1080p LCD TV you can't beat this one!"
1,DO NOT BUY Westinghouse LCD tv's!,"I bought a 37 inch Westinghouse LCD TV from Walmart only a year and a half ago and already the screen went out! Obviously the manufacturers warranty is already up after 1 year and although I called them to ask about what it could be that's wrong they offered me no remorse for the lack of quality and no solution. I then called a tv repair shop and was informed that flat panel TV's have only about an 18 month life expectancy before they go out! Well if I would of know that I wouldn't have spent $600 on one, I would have stuck with the TV I had that lasted for 20 years. So my recommendation is not to buy TV's from Westinghouse I am shocked, broke and severely disappointed.."
4,A great companion to lounge music,Lanza tells the story about the music that music snobs don't want you to hear. And he tells it clearly and with charm and wit. I wish there was a CD to accompany this book.
2,Uneven but interesting effort,"Lanza's historical treatment of modern moodsong is interesting, but uneven. Rather than telling a cohesive story, the book appears to have loosely connected sets of facts that meander chronologically. At times, there are sentences in the same paragraph that don't have anything to do with each other. Moreover, he uses quotes but doesn't attribute their source. In a passage about Brian Eno, I can't tell if the quotation was said by Eno or about Eno. Finally, the treatment of New Age music is cursory and one-dimensional. The advent of Windham Hill and Will Ackerman's rejection of the term ""New Age"" to describe the label is missing. However, if you have the patience to read through it, it does contain some interesting details about background music, easy listening, and the like."
5,Jim Kelly can sure do those round house kicks,"I love this movie. Its one kung-fu movie that any kung-fu fan should buy, or atleast rent. This film is action packed and full of those roundhouse kicks, you can tell right when they come up. The best part of this film is the car wash fighting seen. BUY THIS MOVIE."
4,Black belt jones,I grew up watching these old school movies. I really enjoyed it brought back a lot memories. And a fan of jim kelly
1,"Awful, awful! awful!","What everyone liked about this film I hated: dumb plot, awful fight sequences, a cast devoid of acting skills, college-level direction, etc. etc. You know a karate flick is bad when the star needs a stand-in (toward the end of the film a stand-in does a series of spinning back kicks for Kelly. You can tell it is a stand-in because the actor is several shades darker than Kelly!!!"
3,Its a 70's Karate Fest!,"I take it from the other writer he didn't like it. However you have to look at this movie that in its day it was a good movie. Jim Kelly had just did Enter the Dragon, and many wanted to replace Bruce Lee. Jim Kelley was the next best thing at the time. Some of the Scenes are funny, and I agree that you can't take this seriously. But you can enjoy the movie if you look past some of the corn ball stuff. They did a black version of Enter the dragon. Not! I gave it 3 star's for a good effort and I have to say it is still a classic."
5,This is the big niggest movie,"This movie was SOOOO cool I think its a great movie for all people, black and white alike!BIG NIG!"
4,"""You can tear out my groin just give me my coin!"" - Pinky.",Great movie with great quotes. Only problem is the weak storyline. However this is Jim Kelly's breakout film after he nearly stole'Enter the Dragon' from John Saxon.
2,Too Thin,These pads are way too thin to maneuver on your face. They really don't scrub very much unless you use a lot of pressure. I'm not real happy with them.
3,They need a shipping reality check..,We purchased some of these at a local art supply store - which has since gone out of business. Went to order four more today from amazon to protect the kids yearly creations and they wanted $20.00 to cover shipping..the total weight for the package was one pound four ounces..deleted the order and will look elsewhere..
4,This was a great movie!!,"I'm a huge Robin Shou fan, but fan of his or not, this is a really good movie. The action was non-stop, and it wasn't the cheesy faked kungfu over acted fighing scenes either. They were really powerful on the edge of your seat action scenes with great Martial artists who know what they are doing.Like the other reviewer said, this wasn't an all bang em up bloody action movie either. It actually had a plot to follow. However I very slightly disagree on ""King Kong"". I like the actor, and he did do an excellent job in the movie, but after a while he became a tad cartoonish. Although he was a good character played by a talented actor, he did stretch my last nerve after a while. although he did bring a few laughs and even had some scenes that made ya really feel for the guy.All in all, if you're a Robin Shou fan, or if you just love Martial Arts action movies...this is a MUST have!"
3,amazon sucks,I bougth this book but after a year I want to read it again and amazon system is asking me to buy it again.This makes no sens because when you buy a book you have it forever.
2,Dooku aka Darth Tyrannos,"This Item Is not that Educational in my Opinion.. It is more of a collector item than a toy ,And should be left on its card. One problem is the cape it does not stay on very well,as for the saber slash you have to take the cape of to use that feature."
5,A Must-Have,"Excellent character, good figure, and a must-have for an EpII collection. My only gripe is the paint. I had a hard time finding this one, probably because it's part of collection 2 and they are just starting to find their way to the shelves. Because of the bad paint, I typically compare 4 or 5 of the same character and select the one that has the best paint job. Since I could only find 1 of these Count Dooku figures, I had to get it even though the paint is bad. His facial expression looks surprised rather than evil because his eyebrows are painted too high up. I may get another one later. Despite the bad painting apparent on all EpII figures, this is a good figure and a must-have for fans."
5,THE BEST OF THE SITH!!!!!!,"AWSOME TOY, CERTAINLY THE BEST OF THE SITH. IT'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR HANGER DUEL. IT COMES WITH A SPECIAL ACTION AND WEAPONS.IT COMES WITH:1 GREEN LIGHTSABER1 RED TILTED LIGHTSABER1 DARTH SIDEOUS HOLOGRAMAND SLASHING FORCE ATTACK"
3,Excellent Service,"Gary went the extra mile to ensure I received my order even sooner than expected. Amazon.com suggests that for international surface shipping, you can expect the book in up to six weeks. Gary upgraded the parcel to Air Mail at no extra charge.It arrived 3 days later.Thank you Gary."
2,Pretty old,"I bought this book expecting it to once for all explain aa's zone system. i was quite disappointed that the book is from 1974 and the illustrations are of very poor quality.sure, the basics of good black & white photography are still the same, but think the book feels outdated.there has to be a better guide than this out there."
3,Much of the Information Doesn't Really Apply Nowadays,"This text is interesting mainly from an historical perspective because it's written in the context of films and papers of the 1970s. You'll have to apply the principles to modern materials by doing your own testing. Some of the text essentially advertises the Zone VI company's products, which I suppose is OK if you want to find and use them."
5,Bought 2 and Bought 2 More,"After a lot of research on convertible car seats, I was deciding between the Britax and this car seat. I have twins and will be eventually getting 4 car seats, so price was a major factor. I decided on the Evenflo Triumph DLX and I have to say I love it! I've read a lot of reviews on these that say that they are hard to install, difficult to move the straps to a different position and difficult to release. I found that the installation took 10 minutes to get it tight in both my Acura and my husbands Tahoe. The straps are easily moved without removing the car seat by detaching the cover and lifting a panel. The harness release takes some getting used to after using Graco Snugride seats, but after a few times it's apiece if cake! My son that is using this seat also loves it! He falls asleep rapidly and can see out the window more easily. Like the title says, I bought 2 and will shortly be being 2 more!!<br />"
3,Not Perfect,"I agree with the other reviews that safety is #1 when buying a carseat and this by far has top rating for this; however, with 4 kids our second important factor is easy dismanteling for washing. After my baby got a bitter biscuit all over the car seat and straps I began the task of disassembly. This was not so easy. After 30 mins. I finally called customer support and then found out that you cannot remove the straps for washing. So I had to give the car seat a bath and scrub the sraps with a toothbrush. Did I mention to take the cushion off you have remove 8 screws and the back panel. This is way to much work for me and I would probably make another choice."
3,So So....,I don't know how this seat will do facing forward but it is very hard to maneuver backward. It is hard to release the straps to get your baby in easily. Not too happy so far.
