1,"Dated, skewed ""science""","This book is purely wishful thinking. The so called research is based on manipulation and skewed examples. Do not waste your time trying to ""fix"" your child. Spend that time and energy trying to LOVE your child. There is nothing in this out-dated book that hasn't been proved wrong in the past 10 years."
1,A Parent's Guide to Changing Your Child's Eye Color,"Many parents struggle with feelings of revulsion when their children come out with the wrong eye color. Sometimes a recessive color will reappear after several generations, while in other cases, the child's eye color clashes with the furniture or other decor. In this book, Dr. Joseph Mengele gives practical, useful advice to parents who want to change their child's eye color, and even more importantly, prevent their children from developing unwanted eye colors in the first place.Most of the treatments Dr. Mengele recommends are perfectly safe. Reports of resulting blindness and other disfigurements have been grossly exaggerated by his critics. Ignore the ""all eye colors are good"" lobby and follow the advice in this book if your child's eye color is unacceptable - your child will thank you later."
1,Complete Fiction,This work is complete rubbish. The scientific and medical community condemn the idea that homosexuality can be altered or changed. I urge anyone considering buying this book to turn to legitimate scientific research on the topic.
1,Deceptively logical -- Entirely Fallacious -- Empirically Unsubstantiated,"This book ignores or misinterprets the entirety of psychological, developmental, and biological research on homosexuality. The author exploits people's homophobia and their hopes that they can ""prevent"" homosexuality so that he can take their money. His rhetoric is seemingly rational, but it is entirely unsubstantiated by research and the current scientific understanding of sexual orientation. This book could cause much suffering. Parents who treat their gay children according to the recommendations of this book will live to see their children have to spend much money on psychotherapy - to heal the psychopathology created by this book and their parenting."
1,stupid people,how can you say you can prevent homosexuality its not right for you to say that. you prople must all be racist homophobes.well what you suck.this book is so offensive how to prevent homosexuality.here it is you don`t prevent homosexuality because you can`t it doesn`t work like that.if your son or daughter is gay then they can`t help it its who they are they. you people should be ashamed of yourself.
2,avoiding dumb books,"a silly, extremely close-minded and paranoid work guaranteed to preserve the status quo of messing people up while they're young so that they will then rush off to see PhD's like Nicolosi when they're older.Call it planned obsolescence for minds.I had explored this book assuming it was parody. It then started to read like a Benny Hinn sermon.The combination of the title with mentions of his wife caused me to wonder: ""Are we trying a little too hard to establish or prove our heterosexuality?""Here's a little secret on encouraging homosexuality: worry about your children becoming who they were intended to be and impress these worries on them on a daily basis. Nothing works better than forbidden fruits!"
5,Gay Politics more important than Children's Wellbeing,"I read the hateful reviews, and heard what was said in the news media, before I bought this book, I hope you will forgive me of the crime of reading this book before condemning it. Dr. Nicolosi has been unfairly attacked, there is nothing in this book harmful to children. After reading this book I have more sympathy for homosexual individuals, and no tololarance left for gay activism. I am now convinced homosexuality should be returned to the list of mental disorders. It is beyond words to describe how frightening a thing it is that political axe grinding is more important then what is best for our children."
1,What a title,"First of all: I've not read this book. Yet if its contents are very different from its title than please change the title. Who on earth would like to ""prevent Homosexuality""? It's not a sickness, it is a gift. The real issue here is: how to prevent hate towards people just because they behave differently from you, this is the disease!"
1,Sick....,"Especially in today's open and diverse society, it still surprises me that garbage like this is published. There are even hate-books like this targeted towards CHILDREN, as young as THREE!I am a straight woman, a mother of two daughters and a son, ages 14, 10 and 6; my husband and I have raised them all to be faithful and beleive in God, but to accept everyone for their differences, and to never push their opinions onto others. I love my children for who they are, and if one of them or if ALL of them grew up to be gay, then so what? As long as my children are happy, safe, and with the one they truly love, then I've done my job as a good mother and will be happy for them.Let me just say this right now, if you put your religion before your child and their happiness, then you are nothing but trash, and maybe, you shouldn't even be a parent."
1,Didactic,"Although the author puts forward a shroud of pseudo-science and insufficiently substantial evidence, the meat of the work is clear: This book assumes a didactic, ""Because I say so"" air that completely ignores legitimate ethical arguments. The primary argument, that homosexuality can be prevented with the proper circumstances in the life of a person, even if true, can be compared to the idea of preventing whites from being attracted to blacks. Certainly the kinds of people one is attracted to are not only genetically determined, but the argument that interracial relationships should be prevented has for the most part died out.With no other real arguments to fall back on, this book comes off not only as a work of ignorance, but as a message of hate that has been present in society for centuries, interchanging 'gay' with other groups convenient enough to fear."
1,The book is only dangerous if you believe it it true.,Pseudo-science mumbo-jumbo of the most unscientific methodology. This ranks right up there with eugenics. Hopefully anyone who reads this nonsense is doing so for entertainment or a study in pseudo-science to support someone's twisted ideology.
1,"Hateful, disgusting bigotry.","I am shocked and appalled that this is the first result when one searches 'homosexuality'. This disgusting ""pray away the gay"" attitude is pathetic, and if this is the sort of thing Amazon stands behind, there are plenty of other online shops."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this would be a cute case for my new camera. I wanted something snug and my camera is the exact size of the maximum measurements. I thought from the picture that the top was a flap that came down and secured with velcro. Instead, the sides are sewn together on the top part too. you have to put the bottom of the camera in and then wrestle to get the top fitted over it. It took me about ten minutes to get the camera in. And then, even when everything is lined up and on there ""properly"" there's a gap between the top and bottom. I gave it two stars because it might work okay with a smaller camera. But my guess is that with any camera that it fits snugly enough to actually protect, it's going to be a project to get it in and out."
2,"In the end, even I am a little tired of OCS","Firstly, I would like to say that I am a huge Ocean Colour Scene fan, and they are one of my all time favourite bands. But I'm afraid here is where I draw the line. This album is uninspired and quite boring. There are no songs on here which would have been a single off any previous OCS album except maybe their self titled debut. The lead single I Told You So is the only one which provides any sort of break to this, but to be honest it is almost as far from The Circle as a Girls Aloud single.It is still Ocean Colour Scene and so is a relaxing listen, but there is nothing on here to inspire any emotional impact or musical excitement.If you are interested in Ocean Colour Scene, you may want this to complete a collection, but otherwise look to any of their previous albums and not here."
1,Don't Bother With This Edition!,"It looks like a good deal, but it is not. These are both great movies, no doubt. But this is not a good quality package to buy. Both movies are 20 or so years old. So when they're offered together at a bargain price you tend to not think much of it. But this version is very low quality. First off, TSOTL is in ""Full Screen"" only, no widescreen. The way this thing is described, it makes you think both movies are in widescreen. Second, both movies look like they used a bad print. The colors are washed out and many scenes are kind of fuzzy. Parts of TSOTL look like they were filmed by a guy sitting in the theater using a hand held camera. If I didn't know that these were not bootleg copies, I would think they were. Don't waste your money! This bargain price is no real bargain. Even at this low price you don't get what you pay for."
5,Music teacher's review,Lighter and easy to store. Sounds better and feels better then your standard practice mute. Sounds good as a bucket mute too half hung off the bell(has rubber grip on inside) although it looks a little funny. However if you need a really quick change you're better off with the H&b(holding in front of bell unclipped) or jor ral.
1,This Service is Terrible,"I'm an extremely mad that I have not received my book yet. I orderedthat book on January 8, 2007 and I have almost had to drop my classbecause I have not received the book. This is absolutely ridiculous andI want a some sort of refund. This book has caused many problems and Ipayed over $50 to recieve it two weeks ago. I WANT SO DISCOUNT AND I WANT MY BOOK!"
1,"Over , oer and over again...","Wow... I didn't think anyone could say the same thing so many different ways and so many different times and sell their book. The only reason this book sells is because their are good salesman who convene department head to use this book.I read the text book cover to cover and after writting my notes out from the whole book, my notes were only four pages long, this book is a waste of time.I will admit their are several quotes and passages that made me chuckle but, over all this is not a good buy.I am selling my book back and I'm only half way through my semester."
5,WAYYYYY cheaper then school price,"Bought this after I learned that the school was selling the same book for way to much. I ended up getting in on here for about $5 and it was in great condition. Very happy with my purchase, and with the extra money I took the wife out to dinner."
4,everything but the code!!!,"Everything was included but the code you need to log onto the Lucas website. Therefore you would still have to purchase the code for $15.00, so really it is not any less expensive than any other seller...."
4,Useful,"Not cheap for the class, but very useful and clear cut. All the material included wasn't very helpful to me, but the website was. Overall, stll nice but no keeping value..."
1,BAD BOOKS,"I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THE BOOK I RECIEVED, IT STATED THAT IT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION WHEN IN FACT IT HAD SOME KIND OF WATER OR COFFEE DAMAGE TO IT AND IT SMELLED OLD AND DIDNT COME WITH THE CD'S LIKE THE AD SAID!!I ALREADY COMPLAINED ABOUT IT WHEN I FIRST GOT THE BOOK AND I HAVE HAD NO CONTACT FROM AMAZON OR THE SELLER!! I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK BECAUSE THE MAIN PART OF THE BOOK (THE CD'S) IS WHAT I NEEDED AND DIDNT RECIEVE!!THE SELLER NEEDED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THE BOOK AND WHAT DIDNT COME WITH IT BECAUSE HAD I KNOWN THE CD'S WASNT WITH THE BOOK, I WOULDNT HAVE BOUGHT IT!!!!!"
1,disappointed,i have not yet received my book and i purchased it more than a week ago. i need it for a class. its very disappointing
4,Bought for College Class-Serves Purpose-Good Condition!,I bought the book for a college class and it serves it purpose well. The book was in good condition to be used.
1,I would not rate you any stars,I still have not recieved my purchase. How do I get a refund!? Because I think this is ridiculous that I am now finished with my semester and I never had the chance to use the book I order from this website. I will not order books from amazon ever again. Please tell me how to get my money back.
4,In Great shape and great savings,THe product was in great condition. Basically new but got it for half price. Great buy and service. Recieved it in about a week.
2,Review on my purchase of a public speaking text book.,"The product itself arrived in great condition as promised. However, I am extremely dissapointed with the way it was shipped to me. I chose to pay extra money to get the book to me the next day, a Friday, because I needed it for class. Unfortunatly, Amazon.com couldn't be bothered to get the package to me until Monday, which made my life very difficult. I wouldn't have even gotten the book on time for class on Monday if I hadn't called UPS and told them I was supposed to have gotten the book several days ago. I will not trust Amazon.com to get books to me with next day shipping ever again. If I need a book in a short amount of time I will be taking my business elsewhere."
4,"Sweet, dude.","I got turned on to this music at a hockey game, I've been describing it as the ""go king king go"" song (cause that's what it sounded like when I first heard it in ""Excaliber"") and could never find it. Then heard it on a commercial when I was near a classical music type person and was able to buy it (run a search for ""go king king go"" in Amazons search engine!).I'm sure everyone has heard this music, but not this quality. Other versions I've heard (like in movies, commercials, and hockey games) are almost indecipherable. The music overwhelms the singer people in the other ones, this version seems to me to be what the composer had in mind. Of course, the composer is probably dead so I don't know for SURE what he had in mind.Seriously, this has the best balance of the 2 or 3 versions I've heard. I wasn't until after hearing this disk that I found out that they don't EVER say ""go king king go""."
5,the coleman concept,"here is the modern day ellington,basie,coltrane,daviscolemans writing and use of rhythms of the worlds great cultures represents for me the ongoing development of music as an artform this album like his others before keeps pushing the envelope and makes me realize how interactive different styles of musical rhythms of the globe react with one anotherfor me there is no finer album to show thiscomplex yes initially but further listens show the simplicity,but genius of the materialif you want to have youre senses pushed try this album of knowledge and enlightenment"
3,The book came in great state. A little late though.,"The book came in great condition, all pages included with the cd. I expected to arrive like in a week, it took 2 weeks to arrive."
5,a great read (& re-read & re-read),I first encountered this book nearly twenty years ago. As soon as I read it I fell in love with it. The characters are real and engaging. Even when Gretchen is being stupid you still cheer her on and want the best for her. I keep hoping to find this as an e-book so that I can take it with me everywhere I go. This book is a great read for any woman who has felt like she is jinxed when it comes to love.
2,Hair Volumizer Attachment,"Does not seems to really do the job of volumizing. Drys my hair but would not recommend it for lifting the hair. Easily falls off the end of the dryer, I have to be extra careful when using it. I'm not sure why no one is making the old style volumizing dryer."
4,Great Protection and Super-light!,"I must admit that I did not purchase this case through Amazon, because I thought that the description that it had all the protection of a hardshell case had to be hype. So I checked it out at my local guitar store, and it's true! This case is so much lighter than a hard case, looks good, and should be durable. The only thing I wouldn't do with this case is use it to transport my guitar on an airplane. I've only had the case a few months and love it, but wonder how the zipper will hold up over time."
5,Another great Melissa and Doug Toy!,"We got this today and my kids have played with it non-stop! My son has been showing my little girl how to ""cut"" the items in two. It's really a very cute set! I don't know how well the velcro pieces will stay but so far so good! It's a really great toy!"
4,Recommend!,"My 2 yr old daughter received this as a gift, and we all love it! It is such a fun and durable toy. There are a few cons: The paint is starting to rub off on the knife a bit, the inside of the fruit and veggies is not detailed like the M&D wooden slice-able fruit set, and my daughter was actually able to bite a piece off the corner of the watermelon when I wasn't looking, which makes me think maybe that part of the wood was too soft. Thankfully, she didn't break a tooth! All in all, this is a great product, and I highly recommend!"
5,This is a learning tool but they think it's a toy,I have twin boys that are 5 and my older twin is autistic. We started at a new school that had a special program for him. His teacher had this at his school she had him use this to help with his dexterity. He loves this so much he wants to play with this every day. I have been looking for this and now will get this for him at home. This is a great product and I recommend this to anyone my other twin likes the product as well.
1,"Cheaply made, smells awful.... and the shapes of the vegetables?","I've heard such good things about Melissa & Doug products, but I'm sorry -- this food didn't really ""cut it"" for me. The only thing that's painted is the top of the food, you have to get the pieces to match up just right to re-velcro it, the velcro wears out... the knife was splintery. For the price, there's just more bad about it than good.Also, not to be perverse, but the cucumber and carrot look nothing like what they are supposed to be! My Mom, myself, and my husband both thought the same thing without any mention of it to each other."
3,A Favorite!,"Our grandsons have had a good time playing with this set of cutting veggies/breads! We weren't sure if they would have an interest, however, it has given them fun play time and held their interest for lengthy periods of time. Concerned the velcro won't last long though."
2,"Cute toy, but cheap paint","My girls (aged 2, 3, and 4) received this toy for Christmas last year. They loved playing with it, and did learn to cut the toys right away. But, they played with the pieces in a bowl of water in their toy kitchen. The pieces didn't even last a few days before the paint started chipping off. I've seen this problem with several other Melissa and Doug toys, including other food crate toys and lacing beads. I am not too interested in purchasing any more Melissa and Doug toys, which is too bad, because they do have such great ideas.Melissa & Doug Cutting Food BoxMelissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Cutting Fruit CrateMelissa & Doug Food GroupsMelissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden 27-Piece Lacing Beads in a Box"
5,What a great toy,"My 3-year-old son likes being able to cut his own vegetables, fruits and breads as I prepare dinner. I don't have to worry about his reaching for my sharp knife - he prepares his ""stew"" beside me. He can play with this toy for hours, and engages lots of adults."
4,Keep's daughter's attention for long time,"My 2-year-old daughter loves this set. She uses the knife to cut the pieces apart easily now that she's figured it out and spends a lot of time doing so. A couple of the food items could be a little more easily recognizable (carrot and zucchini/cucumber), but that doesn't seem to bother my daughter. She calls it whatever we call it."
3,Its an okay toy,"It is a good toy for what it is. My daughter likes playing with it. My only complanit or comment is that it is really hard for my daugther to cut it. She is 3 so maybe she just needs to work her arm strength more. There have been several times where I had to ""start"" the cutting processes for her."
5,Love This Toy,"We have had this product for 2 months. Both my 2 and 3 year old love it! To be honest my 8 and 10 year old also play around with it a bit....My 2 year old can spend over 30 minutes playing with this toy. He enjoys taking each piece out of the box, saying what it is, and practice cutting and putting the food back together. My 3 year old likes to cut the food and put it into her pots and pans to 'cook' it.The quality of this product has been fantastic. The Velcro that holds the items together is strong enough to hold the pieces together but just loose enough that my kids can cut them. The Velcro was a bit tight at first but after a few days it loosen up perfectly.I would highly recommend this product."
5,"Wonderful toy, very durable!","I bought this for my daughter when she was 2.5, and she still plays with it (she's 7 now). The velcro is good quality, and the cutting sounds are relatively realistic. It has provided hours of fun, imaginative play. The velcro still sticks, even after 5 years, and the paint hasn't faded. Great product!"
4,Fun toy for 3-year-old,"This toy is quite nice. My son got it for his third birthday and has been playing with it a lot. It's neat that it actually makes a noise that sounds like cutting a vegetable because you have to slice through the velcro. I will say that it's a little hard for him to cut the tomato because it's kind of small and hard to hold while cutting it. And he hasn't quite figured out how to put them all back together. It's kind of a puzzle, too! I have a friend who has had them for a while, and she says her paint is chipping off and starting to look pretty bad. And it seems like the velcro could wear out pretty easily. It wouldn't be that bad to glue more velcro circles on it, but I think it would be hard to paint it and match the paint exactly. He's only had it for a few days, but it's a hit so far! He also really likes the pizza kit and the sandwich-making set."
2,Great Toy but BEWARE - Made in China,"My son loves this toy. However, I expected that for this high price it would be made in the USA where toy safety regulations are good. With all the recent lead paint scares in Chinese-made children's toys (even from respected manufacturers), I was VERY disappointed to see ""Made in China"" on the label."
3,Disappointed in Melissa & Doug,"I'm a big fan of Melissa & Doug, but I have to say I'm disappointed in this food cutting set. My 15month old hardly played with it at all before the paint started peeling off around where the parts velcro together on a couple of the pieces. At least I know it's non-toxic paint, but I would have expected better of Melissa & Doug.The other thing that I hadn't thought of prior to getting this set is that there is wonderfully realistic play food available out there, but this play food only vaguely resembles the real thing so while my daughter has fun cutting it, she seems to be drawn more to her playfood that more closely resembles real food."
4,TEACH'EM TO CUT!,"Even though i downgraded this toy for 'educational value', it doesn't make it any less fun. Everything doesn't have to have a huge 'educational value'! The 2 year old I gave this to loved it and played independently with it for a long while. I think it is probably better for a 3 year old as when she couldn't handle the velcro or knife, she'd just rip the pieces apart. The toy is well made and promotes creative play. I do wonder, however, how long the velcro will last. I'd buy it again - a definite hit!"
5,Worth the money,I have two boys age 5 and 3 who love to pretend to cook. I bought this set 6 months ago and it continues to be a favorite on a daily basis. It has already outlasted many of the plastic or cardboard food sets I have bought. It is also an extra bonus that they have to figure out how to put the food back together so it looks right! It has been a big plus for me that it came with TWO wooden knives and a nice wooden stoage box. I will be buying this as a gift for many of my friends' kids in the future!
4,"Great toy, but got beat up quickly.","We got this last week and my 3 yr old. LOVES IT! It's a great toy but the zucchini is a bit difficult to chop. I feel they all need little grooves like the bread has for easier cutting. You do need to apply some pressure when ""chopping"" as some of the items are a bit difficult to ""chop"". The bread slices have began to show some wear after a week and one had a big chip in the wood already. Our cutting board was the first to get damaged, the wood split after 1 use. Not sure how but in two places the pieces are separating."
4,My son loves it!,"My son loves this set. He sits and plays with it continuously! I love that he enjoys pretend snacking on the fruits and can cut it up and put them back together. He is 21 months and has played with it everyday since getting it, about a month now. My only concern would be the paint coming off. I already see the red paint scraping onto the wooden knife and cutting board. Other than that, we love it!"
5,Awesome product!!!,I bought this for my two year old and she loves it. It's a great toy. So much fun. She loves to slice the bread for me!
5,Nice product,My son likes to pull the pieces apart. You don't find many wood toys anymore. I recommend this product to anyone trying to develope their child's fine motor skills.
5,Cutting Food,"The Melissa and Doug Cutting food toys are absolutely a hit - I can't give them enough stars.The quality of these toys are excellent - even the boxes that they come in. The sound the food makes when ""cut"" (the velcro comes apart) actually sounds like cutting! They are also fairly easy to cut. A couple pieces I had to take apart the very first time so the velcro connection wasn't quite as tight, but that's not a problem as far as I'm concerned.If you are on the fence about buying these toys - do it! I have been amazed at how much fun they have been and that they are played with almost every day. We now have the cutting foods set and sandwich set, and everyone has fun playing with them - even my 15 year old!"
1,Buy FisherPrice Instead!,"I was completely shocked by this product because I normally love Melissa & Doug toys. The quality is very low. The paint on the vegetables is not uniform (i.e. the bread has streaks of pink and purple on it) and the smell was horrible just out of the box. My daughter pretended to eat it...(this is toy food!) and said ""yucky"" because indeed, there was some kind of awful taste to it probably from the horrible paint. I have to be honest, I love the FisherPrice toy food a lot more than this. She never plays with it, preferring the toys that look more realistic. Melissa & Doug fail."
4,These are great,Love these wooden veggies and so does my daughter. The only complaint is that because they come apart there are lots of pieces that can get scattered about. But I do feel they are very interactive and she enjoys them.
5,Very realistic kitchen toy,"My 3 and a half year old son loves this toy! He wants so badly to cut things, but he's not ready for a sharp knife yet. He gets to practice his cutting skills while playing imaginatively. The food is all connected by velcro and when you insert the knife into the slicing points the velcro comes apart. The velcro is actually pretty strong so he has to cut pretty forcefully just as if he were cutting through real food. I can see where the strength of the velcro may decrease over time, but have not experienced that yet. The pieces are also likely to get lost if your child isn't good about putting them back together after they cut it up. Fun and educational toy!"
5,Great Toy,"I run a home daycare and bought this to add to my table toy collection for my young preschoolers and one toddler. My 18 month old loves it and can cut the pieces apart, he does need help putting them together and holding some of the pieces while he cuts them, but we have not used it that much yet. The 3 year old children I have can use it basically by themselves, some of the food pieces have to go back together a certain way so that is hard for them. Overall this is a great toy, seems pretty tough, and if the Velcro ever comes loose it will be easy to fix. Good buy for kids!"
3,"Love the toy, the quality...not so much","The knife in the first item that Amazon sent separated into two pieces the first time my son used it. It looks like it was never glued together. Amazon replaced it right away, and the second set seems to be okay. I don't have a ton of faith that this toy will last forever, but my son does enjoy cutting his food and pretending to eat it."
5,Wooden Food & wooden knife,"This turned out to be a great toy that my son thoroughly enjoys. The wooden knife cuts like a real kife, as far as seperating the wooden pieces of food. My son (and even my husband) love it!"
5,Great product even for little ones!,"My daughter was 1 when she first started playing with this. She is now 2 and I have ordered many other sets from Melissa and Doug. I find their products to be very durable, and I have never had an issue with the paint. Will be buying a ton more in the future!"
5,Realistic food to cut but safe,These foods that you can cut are so realistic and fun for the kids to play with. A little toddler can manage to do it. Teaches coordination and is plenty of fun.
1,Concerned,Melissa & Doug sound like they live next door. I was disappointed to learn that all their toys are made in China. I am still worried about lead paint and don't trust Chinese regulation/enforcement.
2,Doesn't last,"My children at the center thought this was the greatest thing. Only problem is after 2 sets, it doesnt last. The velcro wears out. I ended up purchasing a plastic set that is lasting better."
5,Great Toy!,"I'll keep this short since there are so many other reviews. We just gave this to our two year old for her birthday. It says for three years plus, but she's had the cheap cutting plastic food and we wanted to upgrade. The plastic doesn't last long with little kids, it gets stepped on and broken pretty easily. My daughter got this at her birthday party and was a hit with the kids from then on. It's always in the middle of the living room floor because someone is always playing with it. Some of the paint was already on the cutting board after the first night, but that's not a surprise after reading the other reviews. It's tough being a toy these days."
5,Excellent toy and so much fun!,"My 2 year old son absolutely loves this toy. We originally discovered it as speech therapy, and since he liked it so much, we bought it for him to play with at home. The wooden pieces are high-quality and make a satisfying ""crunch"" sound when cut. We liked it so much that we also purchased the cutting fruit crate which is also made by Melissa & Doug."
5,Good purchase,We bought this food set for our 18 mo. old. He goes back to it again and again. I see it lasting for a long time. Great toy!
5,Fave toy that Santa brought!,My kids are ages 3 and 2. They both love this. I might buy another one to keep at my parents' house. Keeps them so busy. They played more with this than any other toy Santa brought them.
5,Fun for everyone!,"Got this set to go with a play kitchen for my 3yo daughter. Well, my 12, 10 and 5 yo boys are having as much fun slicing up the food as she is! Well made, and the velcro holding the food together is holding up well."
5,Great Overall!!!,I recently bought this for my nephew who is two and he loves it. I loved it because it wasn't made from stupid plastic. The wood makes it last and durable...so when he growes out of it someone else can play with it. And he loves to play pretend with food.
5,Fun Food,This toy was brought to my house from my sons speech therapist. He took to it right away. The food makes realistic cutting sounds as the food velcro is separated. Since then we have bought the fruit as well. He has learned the names of the food verbally and in sign language. We have now bought this toy for all of his friends because when they come over they all want to play with it. Fantastic toy.
5,High quality and fun!,"This was a Christmas present for our then almost two year old, and he does enjoy it. The ""food"" has a nice feel, and the apple, especially, has a realistic crunching sound when cut. A lot of fun--I've always been satisfied with Melissa and Doug products. Recommended."
5,Buy it!,"My 3-1/2 year old grandson opened this gift, among others, at Christmas and kept going back to it. Very fun! They love ""food"" items at this age."
2,"Warning, dont add water","My 2 and 4 year olds got this for Christmas, and decided to make vegetable soup. And whats vegetable soup without a little (or lot) of water. 30 mins later, the paint is peeling off all the tomatoes and carrots and the whole box has to be thrown away. Im suprised this hasnt come up in any of the 100+ reviews, maybe I have the only kids who extensively use water when they're playing with food. They rinse, they boil, they wash and these pieces cannot handle water.Im sure this is a great quality toy, but not for the way my kids play. Also, the pieces are heavy and hurt when dropped on toes."
3,It's well made,"I think the wooden foods are quite creative and fun to play. However, my 2 and a half year old boy is not interested anymore - played with them for couple days only. I'm hoping that he will get interested again at some point, but never know."
1,I give up...,"People all say they love this toy. I bought it about 1.5 years ago. I have tried to like it, as my daughter got older I hoped my feelings about it would improve, but they haven't (She is 4 and my son is 18 months). It is cute and maybe for an older child who likes puzzles it would be great, but the way that it has to be put together is not easy for a small child. Some pieces have two sides of the same type of velcro and if you misplace those, the rest of the pieces are useless. It also makes it hard for little ones to get it together correctly. My kids do enjoy playing with the little pieces, so it hasn't been a total waste, but I always end up having to put them back together and search for the parts all over the house. I feel similarly about the sandwich kit. The cookies and the cake are great. I also have the 4 food groups and I wish I had ordered two of those instead of this."
2,Not as good as other M & D sets...,"I just purchased this at a store and am disappointed. These pieces are harder to put back together because they have to fit precisely. I watched my daughter lose interest as soon as she couldn't figure out how they fit. She has another M & D set she loves and uses all the time. I was also taken back by some of the shapes of the veggies, they don't look right, and some don't even have detail paint or design, just one color with no identifiable markings like our other sets have. I wish I could return mine now."
5,Fun for EVERYONE!,"We got this for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas, since he always wants to help cook. Everyone played with it for hours, from adults to tweens to teenagers to toddlers. It really sparks pretend cooking and imaginary play. My son has created ""sandwiches"" and ""stew"" as well as many non-food ""things"" with the peices. I'd highly recommend it to anyone and plan to give it as a gift to many kids (and their parents!)"
2,"generally good, but the paint was stuck.","It looked good and educational when I was tearing the plastic wrap. However, the orange paint of wooden carrot was stuck to the natural wooden bread so badley. It seems that the paint was not adhered securely. If you have a kid who loves to put a toy to her mouth, please think this one more time."
5,Loads of fun and learning too,"This is a great addition to any kitchen set. A good quality wooden product, it's realistic enough without being tempting to really eat. The cutting really works, is completely safe and little ones love to do it. Tons of imaginative play possible and very durable. It was a hit!"
4,Better than the best!,This adapter is awesome better than anything i had. It reached a signal that i used to get one bar and now i get two bar. One bad thing is that it takes drew too much power from the computer so i can not use other accessories while i am using the wireless but thats only for me because i have 10 other things running at the same time. I recommend everyone give this one a try...
5,Compact Unit,"Used at a campground to connect to their WIFI which was located to far from our site to connect, and it worked for our needs."
2,comments on Hawking HWUBDD adapter,"Our experience with the Hawking Wireless G dish adapter has not been totally a good one.It has not completely solved the problem of bringing in the signal we want. It works sometimes, but not allthe time."
3,Increase of range,"This unit DOES increase the range. I am able now to use a signal in the neighboring office building (maybe 300' away) while sitting in my favorite coffee shop. It does take a bit of pointing to get it just right, but the signal is quite usable.With my built-in adaptor, on the other hand, the signal strength was inadequate.Complaints: the design is bulky (the dish does not fold conveniently flat or anything) and be forewarned to transport with care. I already popped the dish off its internal spring (secured by the usual flimsy plastic), but managed to reattach it (unscrewed the base and got the snap ring back on and gooped some abs cement on it to reinforce it).Also noted in my old XP portable some complications in switching between multiple wireless adaptors; but nothing I haven't found fixable via a reboot."
3,"Nice idea, but...","This Hawking adapter was very easy to install and configure. It did pick up a number of networks in my neighborhood. Unfortunately, I was not able to get a better connection to my own network than provided by the Intel adapter built into my laptop. So I returned the Hawking to the vendor."
4,Get free internet access from your neighbors,"I live in an apartment building that doesn't have Verizon Wireless which costs about $15. The only way to get a high speed Internet is from cable companies but they are way too expensive. So, either using dial-up or Hawking's dish adapter! It picks up multiple signals from my neiborhood's wireless cable modems, allowing me to surf the Internet at DSL speed. The only drawback is waiting for signals to be freely available, usually in the evening or on weekends. Still worth having if you don't want to pay $40-$60 per month."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I was hoping for improved reception of my wireless signal. No go. Not even in the same house, sadly, much less where I wanted to pick up the signal, about 50 yards away."
4,GR8 Antenna,"I purchased this product in an effort to improve the quality of my WIFI reception. I had been doing some work online and had been unable to perform the function with the built in antenna alone. Once I connected the HWU8DD, not only was I able to perform the necessary functions but the speed and quality of my WIFI connection were both improved substantially."
1,stop working in less than a year,"I bought this because my netgear stop working after two years of use. This one would always drop , so I had to unplug and plug this back into the computer everytime I walk away from my computer for 5 -10 minutes . I got into that habit . So that was fine but now, this literally stop working. Its not even ONE YEAR ! , I will not buy this again for the price. Even though it does received a better signal but its not worth it. The last netgear I bought get good signal. At least it lasted two years."
2,"OK for XP, not for Vista","I used this device happily in my RV under Windows XP. It's not nearly as fragile as it looks and travels very safely in the padded box it arrived in.Using XP, it has great software that shows you both signal strength and signal quality for all available WiFi networks. Once connected, it has a series of blue lights on the base that indicate signal strength so you can fine tune the direction you aim it in. My only gripe was that it's hard to aim at low transmitters without shimming up the base (that, and the usual clueless tech support).It works best if you disable any internal WiFi card in Device Manager.All that goes out the window for Vista. No meters at all, the lights on the base never change --- ever, your WiFi connection will be lost periodically, and your browser will crash often.The people at Hawking have known about these problems for about two years. Why they haven't fixed them is a mystery to me since it's costing them many thousands of dollars in sales."
1,Don't buy Hawking,"It stopped working after 2 weeks. I didn't know about the Amazon 30 day limit and I was stuck dealing with Hawkings' support. When push came to shove, they did not honor the 1 year warranty. Instead they told me it worked."
1,Very Poor Reception,"I have Win XP and this is supposed to work better than the usual non-directional adapter/router that is standard with the Linksys setup, since it is directional. It is just the same. It still has to receive the signal from about 50-60 feet through two rock walls and it does not do that any better than my prior non directional adapter/router. Hard wire may be the only way to go but is way too expensive."
5,Got it for a friend,I got this for a friend and he says that it is working fineNot sure what the other reviews are saying but I tried it once myself and managed to locate many networks around me however when i tried to latch on to an open network i couldn't but again for fairness i tried it once only on the same day i got it and never again.My friend got it as he is based off at a site and where he stays he used to get to the first floor to get access to the connection (he stayed at the second floor) since he got this he said that he never had to leave his room to get better signalGet it if you are far away from your own network but do not count on the fact that it will give you access to remote open wireless connections.
2,"Good functionality, inferior performance","I just tried and am returning an HWU8DD. Seemed well built, software was very good, no installation problems, worked fine under XP SP2. Looked good, too. BUT the sensitivity was not nearly as good as my old D-Link DWL120+ with its small dipole antenna. And I pointedthe HWU8DD at known targets and rotated it through 360 degrees. The DWL120+ saw and associated with signals the HWU8DD never saw, and provided a much better (10dB or more) signal for those both could see. This is my second disappointing experience with a similar Hawking product (wasted time a bit ago with aHWU36D); never again! It is awkward to store and use and does not provide higher performance than a simple dipole unit from other vendors. Don't waste your time or money!"
3,Good for Something,"This antenna clearly boosts WiFi signals more than the built in antenna on my new Lenovo laptop. It is rather fragile, not very transportable, and definitely an indoor device. It's best application would be for a location within a building where a WiFi signal is a little weak. I was looking for something a little more powerful and durable."
5,Wonderful little device,"I received this item only 2 days after ordering with super-saver shipping. Very impressed. I first installed the software on my laptop (no problems at all), then plugged in USB, instantly it found the network and I was surfing. Then installed the software on the desktop (again no problems) and plugged in the USB, and just as quick had the network. The desktop had never had any high-speed connection (ie, wireless card etc...). Very impressed with the ease of use for the unit. I would highly recommend this item for the price."
3,Hawking HWU8DD,"I am not sure I am getting the gain advertised. The one advantage is that I can select the best antenna in a system with more than one antenna. It definitely won't speed up my throughput, that is system dependent. At my current location the system is designed to handle 400 users at the same time but the outgoing pipe is a DSL line! At my next location I will have a much better chance to check the gain in signal as there will only be one signal. I am a full time RVer."
1,"Clunky design, poor performance","I bought this hoping that it would help me connect to some of the open access points around my work, but it did not perform any better than the built-in Intel wi-fi in my notebook. It is a clunky piece of plastic that will fit in no one's bag. There was some included software that gave some nice signal information a la NetStumbler, but besides that, this product is a waste of your time. I returned mine within a week."
2,Not a plug & play for me,"This product was not a ""plug & play"" for me. I spent a few hours trying to figure out how to make it work, then called their tech support (India), who was very nice and patient with me, but he it was hard to understand him. After nearly 90 minutes on the phone with him, the device worked, and worked quite well, but there were lots of steps that I had to go through to make it work. The next day, when I restarted my computer, the device would not connect to my wireless access point, and I couldn't remember all of the steps to go through to make it work, so I sent the device back. Perhaps it didn't work because I'm using a Windows XP Tablet version (for a PC tablet). I've had a couple of applications that either didn't work or didn't work well with the PC Tablet."
2,Doesn't work as it should be..,"It took me over an hour to set up because there wasn't any specific direction to help me set up. I use Vista and over 3 year old manual doesn't mention anything. (though, the box says it supports)When I finally figured out and set up. It didn't really work better than my integrated laptop WLAN.It shows connections with more bars but i had hard time connecting and even after the successful connection, speed was slower than before.I'm returning the item tomorrow."
2,Maybe it's my computer?,"But this thing isn't working at all. I was able to get into MetroFi several times but the signal strength is less than 20% even though my building is within 300 feet of a router. I have a Pentium 3 with Windows 98 so I'm going to try it on another computer but if that doesn't work I'm sending this thing back. Also, signal strength was 2-3 bars until I tried adjusting the dish, then went to zero and stayed there. Maybe this thing is defective."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this hoping I could get a better signal on my laptop at the furthest point from the wireless. I spent about 30 minutes each time I wanted to use the internet trying to find the signal, and when I did, it didn't gain me much speed. It would also lose signal frequently (thus spending more time finding the signal again). Plus, it is very cheaply made and I had to be careful when trasporting it. I sent it back within three days. Beware."
5,Very powerful wireless adapter,"This thing worked amazingly for me, My computer's onboard wireless card never picked up a solid signal from my router. So I bought this, and all my problems were solved, by just pointing the dish in the direction of the router."
2,never got it to work,"I don't know if this is a good product or not, but I can tell you Hawking Tech Customer Service sucks! Took 4 days for them to answer an email, I received the product Dec. 26, took 2 weeks just to get paperwork done so I can return the defective unit."
4,Works well. Awkward to transport.,"The performance of this unit is good; however, the dish and its base do not fold into an easily transportable shape (it must remain open), and it appears that it could be easily broken in transit. I use this unit with laptop to pickup hard to reach signals when I am working, which it does well. The inability to transport this unit safely in a bag is the only real downside."
1,I have a difficult time believing their claim of 8 dB gain but even if it is this isn't a real dish antenna.,"I have a hard time believing their claim of 8 dB gain, for a parabolic dish to properly focus the received signal and to have reasonable gain it needs to be much larger than this, about 10 wavelengths in diameter. At 2.4 GHz a wavelength is just below 5 inches of diameter, how can this thing act like a dish should if it is below ONE wavelength? The moment I took a look at this units photo I knew it was a scam, trying to make people believe it is a real parabolic antenna, it isn't. It might have some gain, maybe even 8 dBi of gain but at 2.4 Ghz you can easily get more gain than that from a simple whip antenna. Look for one here on Amazon, they sell for as little as ten dollars and have +9 dBi of gain and 15 inches tall, more gain than this toy."
3,Not so good on Vista,"I've used the Hawking HWU8dd on a computer with XP for about a year and it works very well. I suspect that most of the people who found it ineffective failed to disable an existing wireless adapter in their computers. It's fragile but I transport it in the original container which has very good foam protection. You could drop it off a building without damaging it.On Vista, however, the adapter works fine once you download the Vista drivers from the Hawking web site BUT, the Hawking software that shows you the available connections is nowhere to be found and the blue bars on the unit that indicate signal strength never show more than one bar even if you're on top of the WiFi antenna.I e-mailed Hawking about this but never got a reply."
2,Disappointing results,One thing that was never conveyed by the manufacturer on this product is that if you have any obstructions (e.g. trees) to the signal you can't get proper reception. Since there are a LOT of trees here (North Carolina) I can't pick up a signal strong enough to get online. I tried buying longer cables and still no luck. Disappointed isn't the half of it.
3,Does NOT work on a Mac,"This may be a great little product, but it does NOT work with a Macintosh computer, which is not stated in the promotional material.Sadly, I had to return it.Chris"
5,Good for expanding your range.,"This little disc surprised me. I have caught wireless with up to 400 meters and with no problems.In my own house we have problem with our laptops to get signal (getting none or only one bar) when sitting in the garden, but with this one we get 3-4 bars."
2,Not for Windows Vista,The software included is for XP. A note included with it gave a website for software. Instructions in writing and on-line are opposite. I contacted customer service and was given a different website address.....MAJOR hassle!! Doesn't seem to work at all with encripted sites. I really wish I hadn't......
3,Remastered is not same as original,"It's hard to find the Future Games album, so I bought this. I was thrilled to hear a nice clean copy of the album, although it sounded a bit different.When I listened to the Spirit of 84, the remastering was significantly different than the original. Much more emphasis on voice and less on Randy's guitar work. Or emphasis on other things leaving what was more meaningful in a different ambiance. Actually, I was kind of disappointed, having grown up with Spirit in the 1960's. Oh well, you can never go back it seems.Keep in mind that the early stuff will not sound like you remember it when you listen to this remastered recording."
4,How To Run A Railroad,"This book gives a very detailed description along with detailed instructions and hints in order for any person to begin constructing a model railroad. Very interesting to read, never thought this subject could interest me, but after reading it I would like to build a model railroad as a hobby. Captivates you with all the little extra fun things you can do when building a railroad and make it so realistic. Very interesting book. If you're thinking of building a model railroad or have ever thought of building one you must first read this book."
4,good good,I bought this for a friend as far as I know they like it and there is no problems.Thank You
1,Fit camera a bit too snugly - not a fan,"I checked the dimensions of the product versus that of my camera. After comparing the two I went ahead and bought the case...it didn't fit. The material is stretchy and it's way too hard to get my camera in there. Didn't like the product. If I had to get my camera out and put it back in it would take way too long, and would drive me crazy! It was way too snug. And I would prefer a different material, not a fan of the stretchy case. Too bad because it's a cute design."
3,Only Buy It On DVD,"First off,I personly think the movie is better on DVD.You can put in subtitles in Spanish and French.You get a special feature to watch the Play music video Us Against The World.(They are the ones singing at the club.Incase you didn't know.:P) There are other neat things,but I can't rember.It isn't their greatest movie,but it was better then Our Lips Are Sealed. But if you want the movie,ONLY BUY IT ON DVD!"
4,ALL MK and Ashley!!!,"I believe that this movie is just 100% Mary-Kate and Ashley! I think they need more stars. Also, cant Mary-Kate and Ashley be the bad girls? The movie shows them getting whatever they want! Basically, they are spoiled. I must admit that this a great film and I would have rated it five stars if it weren't for it to be the twins! In real life you would get in trouble and in real life you dont always get what you want!! I still think the twins are fabulous and I am not bad mouthing them. This movie is an excellent movie and it could be a little less of the twins and more of other people!"
5,love it,I was always a big MK&A fan when I was little and this is one of my favorites. I had it on VHS but no longer have a VCR so I'm glad I can still watch it now (:
5,*~Great Movie~*,"This is a very good move for anybody who likes Mary-Kate and Ashley, and who enjoys a good mystery. I bought this movie to take on a road trip, & watched it every bit of the way. You should buy it. :)"
3,Not The Best Of Mary-Kate And Ashley,"Me and my sister are big MK&A fans, but this is definitley not one of their best movies. Usually in their films, they have some sort of plot..along with the whole boyfriend sidestories. This time, the boyfriend stories are the whole movie..and it gets a little tired after a while. Excuse me girls, where did your minds go? It shows girls that their whole lives need to revolve around guys, when they should have been focusing on other things. In the other movies with the girls in them , the movies are not only entertaining, but they involve other things (ie winning london they go to london for a school team). This movie makes the girls look shallow. And whats up with them and smoothies??"
1,Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!,Have I already said this movie was dumb? Because it is! I have seen all of the Olsen twin's movies and this is by far the worse. The movies is pretty short but it feels like hours!It takes place in the Bahamas at the Atlantis Hotel. While the scenery is beautiful the acting is not. Mary-kate and Ashley spend the whole time flirting and giggling (with boys twice their age). The plot of they movie makes no sense at all and only comes ito play at the very end. I suggest that anyone who wants to see this movie waits till it becomes a .99 rental (if even that).
1,Wellllllllll. . . .,"Wow. I didn't know a movie could be so stupid, honestly. I tried to pay close attention to the mind numbing movie, but I couldn't for the life of me find a plot. The movie had no action at all until about a half an hour left in it. It was absolutely terrible. Mary Kate and Ashley usually turn out at least decent movies, but this one was truly the worst I've ever seen. It basically looked like the girls decided they wanted to go to the Bahamas and have the camera crew film them while they had fun. There was hardly any acting and what there was of it wasn't all that great. The ""parents"" part was definitely way too corny. Overall, it was incredibly disappointing."
2,Pathetic!!,"Its better than some of their movies. This is more for teens but is not that good. I thought it was kind of boring. They play Alex and Madison and they take a family vacation to the Bahamas. Although Alex and Madison are dissapointed because they would rather take a vacation with their friends, and not another boring family vacation. Its to much like their older movies that they did in the past. Do something DIFFERENT! They meet cute boys and become friends just like in Our Lips Are Sealed and Winning London."
1,I'M SPEECHLESS...,"I'm 15, and my friends and I rented this for a sleepover, because we knew it would be so lame it would be hysterical. Guess what. Despite our previous hilarious Mary-Kate and Ashley experiences, this film exceeded and went way over ALL of our comic expectations!!! Truly the worst film the two have ever made, and that's really saying something. Between their sulking because they've missed the class trip to Hawaii (because their evil dad made them go to the Bahamas!), their extended commercial shots of Paradise Island, their ... boyfriends and their ... clothes, this movie is hilarious..."
1,This is totally cool,"Just checking. I read that only 4 people have reviewed this so I gave it a 1 just for fun, and to see if it changes consumer rating. I think that Mary Kate and Ashley look very pretty too."
1,Painful to Watch,"We rented this to watch before we went to the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas. It was a way to see the resourt before we went, but it was painful to watch. The plot is bad, the acting is bad, the writing is bad. The only thing good was the scenery! I have to admit that as painful as it was for the parents to watch, the kids did enjoy it!"
3,A Cool Holiday Movie!,O.K. I don't mean to be rude but the movie starts off very far out! Mary-Kate and Ashley do not act at all. However the ending gets better. I don't like the idea of the Olsens getting in to jail. So this movie is not for kids 8 or under. I hate the kissing parts because they are too far from this century! I love the way the Olsens dress in the movie because they show themselvs as teens and not todlers. Holiday In The Sun is an entertaning movie for Olsen fans!
3,Not the Best,This movie had some good points in it but over all it was very phony and unrealistic. Definently not as good as some of the others but better than winning london. I would only suggest this movie to major MK and A fans!
4,Lo conjeturo era aceptable.,"He estado mirando a gemelos de olsen desde entonces cac llena.He visto todos sus videos caseros y diria que este era el mejor.Tendria que darle cuatro porque al mirar al Olsen los videos son todos sobre todo iguales,misterio.De todas formas, seguia siendo grande, y si usted lo usted lo mira usted tendra gusto probablemente de el tambien."
5,The Olsen Twins are so Hot !,"Damn if I ever saw 2 beautiful girls in the same movie it would be the olsen twins. That's [bad] when Madison ends up with Griffen that dork. He can't drive , he's going to be in college and he's never been kissed freak show or what virgin trial. Ashley looked incredible I believe that Jordan was an okay guy, but Madison really should have ended up with Scott. That Brianna Wallace didn't play the part of the jealous girl very good. ..."
2,Holiday In The Sun,I thought that this movie was really chessey. I mean Mary Kate& Ashley have made better movies than this one. Although their cloths were really neat and the Bahamas is a beautiful place the movie was way to boring.I was kind of upset because Mk&A are such good actresses they should use their talent in a better way (instead of making a cheesey movie like this one)
2,Just makes you jealous,"ok, I used to think that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson were lame. But lately, I've become pretty obsessed with their show and find myself watching the movie marathons on tv. While I did enjoy ""Holiday In The Sun"" my main comment is that it made me feel bad about myself. Not to good for a movie which is meant for girls. It just made me wonder, ""why dont I have a private airplane, why dont I get to go to resorts, why do I have a limo, or a private suite, or tons of boys after me..."" I even wanted a twin at that moment! Well anyways...while Im not completely dissing the movie, I would have enjoyed it a lot better if the girls were depicted more realistically. I mean, what do they have that we dont to deserve all of that?"
4,Holiday in da sun,it wasn t da best but it was a must have. U should buy it for ur kids no matter what age!
1,Yet another B-movie.,"Along with Our Lips Are Sealed, Passport to Paris, and that one movie that took place in Italy, the Olsen twins have made another crappy film.Between desperate Griffin trying to help clueless Scott get Madison to think he's ""smart"" and Jordan being Mr. Cool over Alex...what's the difference between Madison and Alex??? This movie truly stinks.It's all MK and Ash having fluffy fun at an island resort, and then saving the US from Champlain.Give this movie to an 8-year-old girl for Christmas...they'll love it."
2,My teenage life is not like this,The movie starts of with them sitting in the there classroom and then daddy picks them up in there private jet (ok then)with some doughnuts. Then they arrive in paradise and do the usual you know boys and solving a crime stuff like that. Do teenagers in the usa really live like this iam so jealous of this lifestyle.
3,Nice movie.....,"I really like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. I always try to buy all their videos. For me, this one is the best movie they filmed. It's very nice. I really like the setting. I also like their nice clothes. But, this is not for little girls since it has kissing scenes. I just gave it three stars since it's also a bit too mature. Like, us teenagers not yet in college or so in the Philippines, we can't watch/do kissing. They're (MKA) even too young to do kissing.....But anyway, this is STILL a nice movie.(I think it's the best one I have!!!!!)"
2,This was so lame!!,"Okay, I am 14 and my two younger sisters and I enjoy Mary Kate and Ashley alot. But Holiday in the Sun was AWFUL!!! Other than the nice scenery, the soundtrack(by Superchick, one of my favorite bands) and did I mention the scenery, this movie was manly about 4 things:1. the beach (which is where half of the movie takes place)2. hot guys (who compared to Pete & Avery from Our Lips Are Sealed were not hot at all and all looked alike to me the first time I watched it.)3. lying (the girls are constantly lying to thier parents, I mean what happened to values?)4. smoothies. (which you have to see the movie to understand.)This movie was pretty much a waste of time and made me feel like I want to be rich enough to go to the Bahamas in a private jet and have my own suite. But I don't have a twin...."
2,Although this movie stunk and well had no point.......,I like mary-kate and ashley movies (not the younger ones but the older more recent movies) not because I actually expect them too be good but becuase i guess i expect a good laugh on how cheesey and ridiculous and fake they movies are. Also because of teh expected two hott guys for each movie. But this movie jsut bad.. no plot no point and well stupid it went no where. The guys werent even that cute (the only one that was was Griffen). Although this movie was horrible i still got many laughs from it jsut becuase it was so stupid!! But what was up with that if u have a cake can u eat it and if u make ur bed can u sleep in it stuff i way totally did not get thos ( i don't think MKandA actually did eiether!!!) and they took up like half teh movie!! Next time i hope mary kate and ashley will do better on their next movie.....and why is ashleys name always last! i dont get it
5,In Australia yet?,We don't have access to it in Australia and I'm not sure if I buy the DVD here that it'll work in mine!However I have heard that you can order it through the Borders book shop!
4,Four and a half stars,"Anticipating the release of this movie even before Mary-Kate and Ashley filmed it, I was hoping for a movie to top off Winning London. At this point, I would have to say that Winning London is Mary-Kate and Ashley's best work, BUT I loved Holiday in the Sun. It is fun, fresh and the setting ofcourse is absolutley gorgeous. Mary-Kate and Ashley look better than ever and continue to impress their fans all around the world.The DVD special features are excellent, with a look behind the scenes, and at the fantastic clothes Mary-Kate and Ashley wear.Check out the DVD edition if you can!"
2,its ok,"This movie was ok but since Mary-kate and Ashley are getting older the movies are getting a little dull. They always have the same story line for every movie. I think ""Our Lips are Seeled"" was much better than ""Holiday in the Sun."" After awhile the movie got boring and felt like you were just watching two girls run back and forth across the sceen. Over all it wasn't the best movie I've seen latley."
5,Holiday In The Sun,"I obtained this movie as a Christmas present from my Mother and Father, and I absolutely loved it! Being thirteen years old, I enjoyed how the Olsen twins movies have grown along with them, and I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of ten. There are multiple kissing scenes in this video and with it's grown-up additude, I assume that younger childern wouldn't be able to sit still for the hour and one half long movie. The music though is very cool and I enjoyed the new group ""Play"" from Sweeden. The group consists of twelve and fourteen year old girls who sing songs to their age level. I was very amazed at how the Olsen twins movies have grown along with them, and I am very proud to say that they are doing a wonderful acting job. I will definently purchase their next film."
2,Not up to par,"This movie seemed like one long commercial for the resort where it was filmed. The camera tilted at wierd angles and zoomed in for facial close-ups constantly. There didn't seem to be any real plot except to show the girls and their cute companions run around and enjoy a bunch of fun activities. Compared to past entertaining videos such as Winning London and Passport to Paris, this is the first Mary-Kate and Ashley movie I have not enjoyed."
3,Not their best,"As an adult fan of the Olsen twins, I buy their movies unseen. This one is an unfortunate story-less tale. Camera work is horrible, with B&W shots thrown in without meaning, and other strange ideas that don't help. The girls are cute as usual, but there is no plot. A feeble attempt at a subplot comes late in the film and is worthless. The main theme is to dress for the beach and go for the requisite teenage boys. An attempt to make one of the matches seem like the serious love-of-her-life is lame; where is the good old have-fun summer fling between young people? The elements typically thrown into the Olsens' movies - clothes, beachside recreation, shopping - are all uninteresting. Let's eliminate these feeble, flimsy films, girls!"
3,Another movie..,"I just finished watching this new video by the girls, and it was SOMEWHAT enjoyable. I reccommend this video for all ages about 12-17. The storyline has changed from their previous movies making it a little more for older audiences, however, they're not little Michelle anymore.My only complaint with this film is that the camera effects just did not cut it. The camera gets way too close to the subject and shakes too much, making the viewers almost sick sitting for 90 minutes watching the video. I am not sure if they think it's ""cool,"" but it sure makes it hard to keep your eyes focused.Overall, a great movie."
3,"Could have become the best movie, but....",They really have talent. No doubt about that. Actually i'm a great Olsen fan but this movie...the plot is not that good worked out. I like the movie but they should have decided which of the 2 stories they want as the main plot and work that one out. So...you have 2 stories...not one of them worked out properly. I'd say this is more about the Hotel - than about the girls.Anyway...u shouldn't miss it.CYAFlorian
3,Not reallly me,I didn't really like this film I thought it was to slow and boring. It mainly about mary-kate and ashley and they find boyfriends and it goes on very slowly. Not my cup of tea but thats just my oppion I think a lot of people won't like this film. You know I do love mary-kate and Ashley but just not in this film. Although I think New york minute is very good (with mary-kate and ashley). i wasn't dissing you girls but not very good.
4,Holiday In The Sun-A Great Kid's movie,"I liked this movie a lot, and I love Mary Kate and Ashely, they are both gorgeous as well as hot. The film was great, Rated G, acceptable for all audiences. So, this one is ok for you younger children out there. I loved the film, the story, the characters and of course Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. God, I would do anything to meet them. Well, see this film if you know what's good for you. God, I hope they make another film. I LOVE YOU MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY!"
5,almost always on target,"(...) I realise that they are produced for a mass audience but, especially in financial matters, Susan's thoughts tend to be spot on. With regards to the romantic side, however, I find her to be a little too optimistic... but that's just my opinion.She nailed a legacy from a female relative, she nailed my house purchase, she nailed the week in which to settle for a mortgage (I got a historically low rate, which lasted for exactly one week, and has never been seen again), she nailed a huge (HUGE) pay rise and she just nailed a payout from an insurance company.I can only assume that someone out there is getting all my ""love luck"".I like Susan's approach; it's accessible. She's not always right but, by God, she's rarely far from the mark."
5,Susan Miller is always the best!!,"Susan has a friendly and clear way to explain all about astrology, she is very good with her monthly forecast, I totally love her page.If you are interested in learn about astrology, don't look anything else, read any of her books."
5,Know what youre buying!,This is purpose-built equipment. Period. Do your homework and know that you are buying 5.11's PROPRIETARY Back-up Belt system products! That being said these pouches work exactly as advertised with 5.11 Taclite TDU pants as well as an external plate carrier with loop side velcro. Well made and as advertised.
1,Unsatisfied,I'm totally unsatisfied with this item since its to small for my 9mm mags and also it's missing the belt slot its back panel is flat with no belt strap.I'll return it if I knew how .
2,Warning: Read description carefully! No Slick Stick here!,As was stated earlier (and I missed it when ordering) this pouch does NOT have the Slick Stick attachments or even belt loops! All it has is velcro on the back and is useless unless you have a vest or other platform with a big section of velcro on it. Bummer.
3,Only for other 5.11 gear,Quality was good however this product only has velcro to hold it to something. There is no belt loops. It seems only compatible with other 5.11 gear.
3,Kenneth Cole & Romulian cloaking technology,"Finally, Kenneth Cole has managed to develop a watch that is invisible. I have been searching for one like this for a long time. But they are hard to find, heck they are invisible.The watch is powered by plutonium and this baby never needs a battery change."
4,Tarzan in Jurrassic park setting fits great!,This is heady stuff people! If you haven't read it - you must. If you have read it - do so again!
5,Essential for your Home Theater,"An absolutely great CD to own for your home theater. If you know you are going to watch a movie in the comfort of your home and you have over an hour before showtime, pop this cd in!!! Also, this is great for when you have guests over and you are showing off your theater to them! They will be impressed!"
5,Great just what I needed!,"There is a lot of basic information, as well as more in depth information. Have used this multiple times and it is a great reference. I haven't taken my vehicles to a ""mechanic"" in over 10 years, and they are running great. If there is a problem I can use this book, as well as just google to find the information I need to fix the problem.Overall:Very helpful book, it is not comprehensive and will not be able to help you fix all situations, however it gives you a place to start. I have one for every car I own. You will need mechanical abilities as well."
2,Lucinda's Got Her Franchise!,"The NYTBR panned this book recently, but I thought it was harmless brain fluff, like a TV sitcom--Lucy, Full House, Sisters, etc. There's no serial boyfriend gimmick this time around, though a couple of Phoebe's old boyfriends return and the irritating run-on list shtick returns (because, I guess, the writer is a sort of auteur, like Penny Marshall or Ron Howard). On the dust jacket, we're informed there's a ""Phoebe Fine franchise,"" a la MI2 or Tomb Raider (as in, ""Angelina's got her franchise! Now she's set for life!""). Franchise means the subsequent books will likely get worse til Lucinda Rosenfled hits bottom and is branded the new Tama Janowitz (after which she'll write something different, like Peyton Ambrose). The NYTBR was right to compare Why She Went Home to the Meghan Daum book, though a better comparison might have been Doc Hollywood."
1,Who CARES why she went home?,This book is slightly better than the author's first but that's not saying much. The narrator is a privileged self-involved twit and the story is superficial and dull. It also could've used a good weed-whacking...is at least 100 pages too long. Where have all the editors gone? The clever packaging of books like this can't make up for their fundamental mediocrity. Save your money!
2,"cute cover, bad book",I chose this book as my selection for our monthly Book Club. (I'd read a raving good review of it in a magazine)I was disappointed and found it to be a BORING book. Nobody else in the book group found it to be that wonderful either.
2,terribly inaccurate,"I am not a picky individual and usually say that I like everything I buy. This is one exception. I have had other window thermometers in the past, which were quite accurate, so I do have something to compare this one to. The numbers are nice and large, so it's easy to read from a distance. I like the hi and low temp readings as well. The problem is, it's off by roughly 7 to 8 degrees fahrenheit. This is not acceptable by anyone's standards. As a result of this, I don't even bother to look at it. Useless!"
1,Failed too soon!,"I was dissatisfied with this product. Although concerned about the limitations (e.g. Don't expose to water. Don't expose to direct sunlight or freezing conditions, etc.) I placed the thermometer under an overhang facing north, as instructed. And I live in Southern California, so freezing conditions are not a problem. Despite those precautions, the thermometer failed (i.e. half the display is no longer readable.) within 6 months of purchase. Ironically, it failed in August 2012 during a heat wave. In short, don't buy this product. Sadly, it is another example of inferior off shore manufacture."
1,"You Cannot Manually Reset ""Max"" or ""Min"" Temperature Readings","I was looking at similar La Crosse Window thermometers which I noted approvingly reset their ""Maximum"" and ""Minimum"" readings daily which seems logical and useful to me. I then noticed this AcuRite looked similar and had slightly better reviews (although not stellar) so I impulsively opted for this AcuRite model. I felt ridiculous when it arrived yesterday and the owner's manual said the ""Maximum"" and ""Minimum"" temperature reading is only reset when you replace the battery! So theoretically with a 2-year battery – instead of a daily range of temperatures... you get BIANNUAL range of temperatures! Idiotic design in my opinion. And... little reminder to me to read carefully and not take features for granted!"
4,works fine,"super strong suction cups so it stays where you put it on the outside of the window, and seems to work great so far"
1,Exterior window thermometer,"The plastic cups will not stay stuck to the outside of the window. So it is basically unusable. I have attached it to the inside of the window frame with double-sided tape, which will probably take the paint off when I remove it. Not what I wanted at all. Very disappointed."
2,poor for outdoors,"If used outside, it is not water proof. Also you cannot read it when it's dark outside unless there is light from behind."
2,One Year On - Thoughts,"After using this thermometer for a year I can make these evaluations:- it works great as an indoor thermometer sitting on a flat, stable surface- the suction cups are absolutely worthless; all three times that I've tried to attach it to a window it has fallen off and chipped the glass that protects the display- there is no feasible way to use this outdoors without building a special housing and support, which defeats the purpose of the suction cups"
1,Junk!,"The suction cups do not work. It fell off the window within 2 minutes. Another stupid thing about this thermometer is that the Min and Max temp is not for the day, but from the last time the unit lost power, which is probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard. This is getting returned"
1,"not ""acu-rite"" at all",Im in a room that is 62 F...this thing says 82.3F...Garbage!I don't have anything to add but look elsewhere.
3,Temperature thermometer; suction cups don't hold on outside. Works otherwise fine.,This thermometer works fine inside; but falls off if attached on the window outside. So it is disappointing to read outside air temperatures. For reading inside air temperatures it works fine. The numbers and are large and easy to read.
1,Who designed this?,"The battery compartment is not the typical slide type, but rather is sealed with little tiny screws. We have a little tiny screwdriver set and attempted to open the little tiny screws so that we could activate the battery. The little tiny screws are very poor quality and are screwed in so tightly that we ended up mangling the tops trying to get them unscrewed--I failed at one and gave it to my husband to try, and he stripped out the top of the other, with neither of them budging for either of us. So--tiny screws that require a special tool that is not provided, and screws of such poor quality and so tight that they cannot be unscrewed even with the proper tool. Needless to say, this is going right back and I won't be trying this again! If you are a remarkably strong little tiny person with little tiny hands, you might be able to activate the battery; otherwise, move on."
2,I don't recommend--hard to read,"The display on this thermometer is almost impossible to read when it's dark outside--a MAJOR drawback. Even with a back light source (deck light) you have to adjust your viewing angle just right to finally get a temperature read. Even in daylight the display is dim compared to the packaging illustration. The suction cups are iffy. I cleaned and wiped the window completely dry (outdoor temp. was below freezing) and attached the two suction cups successfully--I thought. One of the cups (they alternate) keeps losing its grip and then only one suction cup is supporting the (then crooked) unit. I'm waiting to come home one day and find the unit broken after falling off the window. Only had this five days... will probably return it for a simple, 24-hour readable, dial-type thermometer. Simple is sometimes better"
3,Good for knowing what the outside temp is,"This is my second one of these. The first one stopped working after about 3 years, even with a new battery. I have mine hung on a north facing window (outside), but it overshoots the temperature on hot days. But that being said, I really do like knowing the outside temperature before I go to work"
3,creepy,Creepy bad guy and lots of unlikeable characters throughout. Interesting story and nice Westchester setting. Not the most fast paced/gripping read but kept me interested regardless. Had its share of tense moments.
4,Flawed and human characters you can relate to...,"Bought on the promise of a simple thriller, I found the characters very interesting in their mixed motivations, the gap between self-perception and actual actions (particularly Lynn), as well as the search for something resembling happiness. Found myself caught in the plot, not really as a whodunnit (suspects are quite few, leaving little choices), but as a telling tale of dashed hopes and overreaching hubris. Found myself aching a little, when every mistake and contradiction is fully logical with the character's outlook on life. Recommended, will definitely read more books by this author."
3,"Some nice touches, but I missed the boat I think...","Blauner's novel has some great touches about modern day life, particularly in the shadow of 9/11 (I finished it the day before the 2 year anniversary so the memories are still heavy) and the characters are often sympathetic (I particularly enjoyed Harold, Paco, and Barry). Blauner creates a geniunely creepy Mike for most of the book. However, I found the ending chapters to be like one of those action picture endings--who lives and dies (I shall not reveal) seems to be driven by drama and not realism. It is a good book, but I don't share the love of it that many readers here seem to have."
1,bewildered,"I have written a few books myself and know how difficult themystery genre is to pull off successfully. I read the reviewshere and have concluded I must live on another planet. Referencesto 9/11 have nothing to do with the plot and appear to have beenadded gratuitously to a late revision. The smart-alec dialogue isnot real--NOone talks like these characters. The same ""smart alec""theme permeated the non-dialogue as well.The concept of the author seems to be have been keep thecharacters shallow and unbelievable, the plot the same, and throw obscurities at the reader to impress him/her with the author'sbrilliance. Trouble is, he goes too far. I found about thirty ofthem wrong. I put the book down when the author used ""magnifyingloop"". What he meant was ""loupe"" which is a magnifying lens. Thereare probably many more than thirty if I were to take the trouble to run them down. Anyone want a free book?"
4,The Last Good Day.....a worthy read...held my interest,"A mentally deranged immoral jerk called a police detective named Michael, another mentally disturbed sports memorabilia dealer, named Jeffrey, his unhappy wife, Sandi, and Lynn who claims to be a photographer and gets caught in the middle of this mayhem, plus Baltimore, the police chief, make up the core of this book. Most of the characters are living way above their means with big homes and expensive lifestyles, but, only steps away from bankruptcy. After the murder, everything falls apart for these people who are living on the edge. A worthy read...held my interest."
4,engrossing,"""The Last Good Day"" had very a good plot and subplots. I could not put it downand the ending was not predictable which added to my interest."
3,Easy Read,"An interesting story but the characters seem a little off.When a headless corpse is discovered floating in the waters, commuters soon discover she's a local who grew up with nearly everyone involved in the police investigation.Like a cop who lives too much in his past and a best friend who doesn't realize harassment charges against the cop will bring out her own dirty laundry. Even the police chief knows the dead woman. Then there's his problem of suspecting the cop (who was passed over for the chief's job), who's also a friend, but trying to be impartial. The chief is the most sympathetic character. The other characters and their angst seem thrown in to fill up space and maybe muddy the waters.The ending wrapped up loose ends but it left me dissatisfied. I won't say why since it'd be a spoiler. I will say that anyone who likes their mysteries dark will probably like this one."
1,"trendy, forgettable","Peter Blauner has plugged into the trendy words and behavior of northeastern suburban life circa late September 2001 in his less-than-riveting mystery novel, ""The Last Good Day."" His extremely unsubtle, knock-you-on-the-head references to 9-11 seem to be a carefully calculated attempt to draw readers into his carelessly crafted tale.The chief characters, 40-somethings all, immersed in status-conscious consumerism and obsessed with appearing successful, at all costs, failed to engage the interest of this reader. Their ""secrets"", their long history going back together to high school days, are inferred by readers long before they are slowly ""revealed"" by the events of the book.My conclusion? This novel is not worthy of your time; it fails to be absorbing, timely, or relevant, despite the heavy-handed ploys to make it so."
2,If only we could see it.,"This is a great old noir film, typical B-feature. I saw this as a child and was haunted for a few years by its eerieness. But, this DVD appears to be a copy of something shot off a movie screen with a camcorder and its visual quality is just at the threshold of human perception. The low price made it attractive enough to revive my memory of the more visible original."
4,Nice film noir,"As it has been mentioned before, the quality of this movie isn't very good. It's only a B-movie and it looks like they saved money by not using enough light and cutting the film with an axe.But - the actors are great. I bought the movie because I'm a DeForest Kelley fan and interested in his early work. I was impressed. He's very believable as a man who doesn't know if he's commited murder. Paul Kelly gives a solid performance and the story is unusual. The movie is not as good as ""Laura"" or ""The Woman in the Window"" but has it's moments. If you like old fashioned movies or want to know what Kelley did before he made westerns and science fiction, ""Fear in the Night"" is worth your time and money."
3,Deforest Kelley in his first staring role.,"Let's face it this movie is pretty good but the real reason I got it is because it is DeForest Kelley in his first starring role. It is worth the price for that. The story is pretty good and the dream scenes were ok. But the acting is not at it's best. The worst thing is the lighting. Sometimes there were shadows where it was so dark I couldn't see what the characters were looking at. However, if you like Star Trek and old films this is pretty good. It is nice to see that Kelley had a chance to do other acting then science fiction and old TV westerns. Not bad for his freshman film."
3,"Very light, a little soft","These tires are light, quiet, and tough but some of that lightness comes from using very tiny tread knobs. They've served me very well on hard trails and pavement for casual riding but the unstable feeling of tread flexing bothers me at higher speeds. There's minor tread buzz at certain speeds. There's no annoying ""ping"" noise going over small rocks."
1,WAY OVERPRICED - accidentally order wrong roll,The wire is okay but I accidentally ordered this overpriced wire. The same wire is available for .87 + 3.99 shipping here on Amazon. They show a picture which makes it look like much more wire than you actually get. They do not give the length of this little roll so you wind up paying $8 for the same wire you can get from another seller for $4.86.
2,Chill,"Not a bad mood for disc for chill settings. Ambeint drum and bass kinda on the intelli-tip. i.e. goodlooking records, ltj bukem.Not worth 16 bills, but around the 3 dollar range."
4,The Best American History Book in the World,"It was refreshing, funny, funny and informative. It gave us the facts and asked a few questions that really made us think. My kids kept asking me to keep reading. It is a great starting point to introduce a figure from American History."
5,A Masterpiece,"This book is INCREDIBLE. I had a C in US History, and after purchasing this book, it jumped up to a B+ in a matter of weeks. This book is an excellent resource. It contains information that helps even the worst of students. What i like most about it is it's layout and the text. It is so easy to read! If you don't have this book, your US History class is lacking something: INTELLIGENCE. Buy it now!"
5,"""Ten! I give it a ten!"" Billy Bob from Varsity Blues","Original artwork, creative (yet corny) titles and headings, but most importantly it is written by High School students. It's great for all you non-geriatrics out there that are struggling through the reading of your incredibly boring textbooks. It is written in [common] man terms, but it is still packed with all the facts you need to know about the creation of our great nation."
5,Camo Vest,Great vest perfect for any airsoft/ paintball experience. This vest is extremely durable and I have even thrown it in the washer to clean it and it held up really well (I did not put it in the dryer). It is great for holding all sorts of different equipment for airsoft including all of the magazines you need to play long games. This vest also protects you from any injuries to the chest or back from close rage fire that can be painful.
4,A Moving Story,"This poignant story takes on a common childhood experience, the death of a loved one. Grigor's grandfather, a skilled rug maker, has been teaching Grigor how to weave his own rug. Grigor enjoys spending time with his grandfather and loves hearing stories about the old country, Armenia. Then, one day, Grigor's world is turned upside down. Grandfather is in the hospital. The author of this amazing picture book convincingly conveys a small boy's response to illness and death. Grigor is angry when Grandfather dies, and it is by working through this anger that he comes to terms with death and the love he feels for his grandfather. Young readers will surely be reassured to have their fears acknowledged in such a forthright fashion. The vibrant illustrations add to the story's charm. All in all, an important book on the subject."
4,Makes a very tasty meal,"I'm not sure how authentic this paella is, but it makes for a easy and delicious meal. I add chicken and chorizo to add to the taste. Highly recommended."
5,Surrounds,"I bought these to round out the 5.1 stereo system I've been assembling. All the speakers I used are JBL's, and I think the quality for the price is outstanding. These are no exception, and hold up the back end of the system just fine. The frequency is probably what you'd expect from a small bookshelf speaker, i.e., not great in the bass rage, but they work great with the overall presentation."
4,El Barrendero,"Sweeping the streets and cleaning the beautiful city of Mexico, Cantinflas gets into his role of cleaner but also into the role of flirting. Definitely worth watching!"
5,This is clarity as only Canadian Brass can do.,I have always expected the best from these musicians since I bought their first cd. They have never dissappointed me. Tuba in Pitter Panther Patter is over above and beyond!
4,the american quilt: a history of cloth and comfort 1750-1950,This book expands on the history of the quilt with other interesting events in the era. If you like quilting and history you will enjoy this book.
2,"Not exactly ""good"" but it deserves credit","I hae tried to hate the Backstreet Boys for the longest time but I just bought Millenium and, although I can't say that the music is original or anything exceptional, the songs are sweet and sentimental and I guess we all need one CD full of mushy pop tunes. They aren't bad singers but they could try to utilize their skills and make songs that sound different. I like the CD despite all this (only the goddess knows why)..."
5,Amazing,"This is definately the best cd by BSB! It's a MUST-HAVE!!! I LOVE it!!! There are a mixture of nice balads such as ""Don't Wanna Loose You Now"" and then there are crank-up dance songs like, ""The One"". The tracks on this cd don't have that kinda ""Cheap"" feel to them, like the last cd has such as ""Get Down"". This cd is great for and age from 1 to 101!!! Everybody can love this cd!!! Every song is amazing, and you should DEFINATELY buy it!"
1,SCHLOCK,this cd is just another example of whats wrong with todays corporate music. dance tunes that sound a like and soupy ballads that really dont say much. you can be sure that record executives are currently thumbing through 8x10 glossies to find the next group of pretty boys to scam the public with. i am in music retail and i highly doubt that this title will be reccomended to my customers who want decent music.
2,WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!,"Okay, so they sold 5 million copies. That must make this album good right? WRONG!! Granted they have some songs on this album that don't get on your nerves, most do. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that they can't sing, (unlike 'Nstink but that's another review), they can, 3 of them have commendable dancing skills and they are not lacking in the looks department either but for people to make a big deal out of them, they should have a legit reson. Because they are talented, they could have done a much better job on this album, they should have tested the waters a bit. Well I guess A.j is just a front, they are not as adventerous as they seem. Maybe that explains why people like them so much. They provide a safe haven in a bitter, cruel world. Buy the album, and pray that they get better with age (like fine wine!)."
3,Backstreet Boys New(and unfortunately) improved album,"There first album was and IS better than their second album. They REALLY shouldn't COMPOSE music. The only tracks I liked on the album are ""Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely"", ""Don't Want You Back"", ""It's Gotta Be You"", and ""The Perfect Fan"". Otherwise they shouldn't compose music on whole albums anymore. And I MEAN not anymore. Unfortunately, they are getting old to me at least. They are really into entertaining the adult audiences more than teen audiences. They are quite sexy, but they should just be more open and nicer to their teen audiences. I really only liked their Saturday Night Live performances because I'm a big SNL fan myself. But that's my opinion. They are, really though, quite great if they just stick to producers writing their albums for them. *NSYNC has more brains to do that then they do. That's all for now."
4,An Okay CD,"Milennium is not the greatest Backstreet Boy Cd, but it is full of energy and creativity. Some of the songs sound the same, but this cd shows a little bit more maturity from the five boys. The cd is worth buying."
2,Such wasted potential!,"Well... I like most of the songs on the album. They have that snappy Boy Pop sound that those of us who bought the album love. But... it sounds like they recorded the whole album with buckets over their heads or onto a cassette recorder first. What a disappointment!!! The production values on this CD are so low, that I'm relegating it to my ""sigh"" pile with all the other albums that I bought that ended up just not meeting my expectations. Sigh... again, what a HUGE disappointment."
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! ALBUM OF THE YEAR!,"This album by the Backstreet Boys has proved to live up to my expectations from them and higher. They have matured so much to a higher level. THe songs are more mature though they seem to repeat a lot of lines. SOme songs on this album were actually written by them. It's truly impressive and if you don't get it, you're missin' out on a lot!"
1,Garbage,If I could put in negative stats I would. Phew this album really stinks. All of the people woh like this stuff need to get their heads examined for listining to this trash. This is simplistic bublegum music very bad attempts at R&B. Some of the effects that they use are sort of cool but the music on this album is the equivlant of potato chips audible juck food clogging up the airwaves
5,Backstreet Boys are on Fire!,I am so glad that they finally made a new album. I just got it a few days ago and I can't stop listening to it! I can't wait for them to come in concert!
2,don't want you back,"all the songs sound like the ones on the old cd. and what's wrong with kevin's eyebrows? however, this album did enlighten me. now i understand why that other dude always wear hats. i want it that way is catchy and i'll be over it in a week. everything else isn't worth listening to."
3,Not as great as I thought!!,"This CD isn't as good as the last. There are too many slower songs. They needed more pepped-up songs like last time. But ""I Want It That Way"" makes it better."
3,A TERRIFIC CD!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the BEST CD! I can't stop listening to it! My favorites are Spanish Eyes, a song saying that ""the world is so beautiful tonight......anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes..........."" also the toe-tapping ""Don't Want You Back"", and ""Larger Than Life"". But the absloute BEST is ""I Want It That Way""! If you are a BSB fan or just a plain great pop music fan, buy Backstreet Boys' ""Millenium""!"
3,"Great, but no Boyzone!","In comparison to other ""boy bands,"" Basckstreet Boys' Millennium is campy... or in other not up to par. Many of the songs are great, but they lack the vocal power of groups such as Boyzone. Rest assured if you like the Backstreet Boys, you would LOVE BOYZONE!!"
4,"Pretty good, but could be a little less sappy.","About a year ago, I had a hard time admitting I was a BSB fan. I always thought of myself as more of a hard-core rock kind of person, or R & B, but I found myself listening to BSB's irresistible songs more and more. So finally, with a guilty and sheepish mind, I went out their debut album, which I soon wore out. When I heard their second album was coming out, I finally admitted I was a fan and bought the CD. I don't think this one was as good as the 1st one. I liked ""Larger Than Life,"" ""I Want It That Way,"" ""Show me the Meaning of Being Lonely,"" and ""Back to Your Heart."" All the other songs are sappy and sentimental. But if you are truly a hard core BSB fan, I recommend that you buy the CD. But if you just plain like them, like me, waste your money on something else."
1,Horrible and unartistic,"This music insults anyone who is remotely considered a musician. THEY are not musicians. They are unimaginative, factory made entertainers with no substance to their ""music"". Ask someone why she listens to them and she might say ""Because they're hot!"". Nothing more. Fight the good fight and buy good music. I'm outraged at the notion that garbage sells if the marketers are attractive."
4,Pretty good!,"I m not a big fan of the backstreet boys, but This CD was pretty good. Has too many slow songs on it, but over all good music."
1,Just plain depressing,What do people see in Backstreet Boys? They didn't even write their own songs when they started out and don't play instruments. You call that a band? Their music isn't very original and sounds just like all the other teenybopper groups out there.
3,Backstreets Boys more grown up sound,This Album is not the best if you are like me and like faster songs not all slow songs. They only have like 4 songs I like the rest are slow and about love. In almost all of their songs they contradict themselves-1 song will say baby its the way you make me kinda get me go crazy and the next song will say dont want you back cuz your no good for me. They need to think about that on their next album. If you havent already bought this and are thinking about it think twice before you buy it.
1,good songs......wrong voices,"ricky wright must have a child that loves these guys, because if you read the review of BSB and then read his review of NSYNC. You can see a major prefrence, unfortunately both are unfounded. BSB's harmonies lack much to be desired, they don't incompass the entire spectrum. Their songs, while I love ""show me the meaning of being lonely"", lack the proper voices to make the songs achieve their full potential."
2,I don't like it much,"When this CD first came out, I bought it, loved it, and listened to it all the time. Now I guess I'm tired of it. I'm sick of ""Larger Than Life"" and ""Show Me the Meaning..."" because I heard them on the radio too much. However, I'll never get sick of ""I Want it That Way"". It's a great song. ""Don't Want You Back"" is my other favorite. It's very catchy, even if the lyrics aren't so great. ""The One"" has always been my least favorite on the album, and now I can't stand it. Why did they release this as a single? I'm sorry, but I don't like ""The Perfect Fan"", either. It's sweet, but a little too corny for me. ""It's Gotta Be You"" is a good dance song, though. The remaining 5 songs on the album are alright, I guess. They all kind of blend together. This is not to say don't buy the album. I'm sure you'll love them if you like stuff like 'N Sync. However, BSB's debut album is better, so I'd recommend that before this one."
1,It's really sad music has come to this.,"It's preppy boys making girls cry and prancing around. Not really liked for the ""music"" they make but really for their looks. People buy this because it on MTV. Don't be brainwashed and save your money and buy Bush or somthing. You'll thank people like me later. Not one song I liked. Later"
1,What do you mean Millenium,There is no reason why this CD should be called Millenium. There is nothing special about the album . They sound the same as the first album. If you want something good go buy the *Nsync CD. It'a way better.
1,what a bad joke,New kids on the block part 2 no thank you.these guys can't carry a tone and are a bad joke.who is spending there money on these bums? they will never get any respect because they lack any real talent.
5,This is sure the best BSB albem so far!,"~ALL the songs on this CD are really good! I love Larger Than Life & The One. They're my absolute favs! This albem is really enjoyable if you're a pop or R&B music fanatic. The songs are well organized, all with a different message. I really love songs like that. But I have to say it is WAY better than they're debut, but I still love that one too, but not as well. I urge you, if you already haven't, buy this great BSB CD!! I feel that the Backstreet Boys are the most talented, handsome, hard-working young men in a pop boyband in the world!! THEY ARE really the ones that started this all-boy-band thing in the USA.~"
3,I kinda like this junk!,"Hey, I have an idea, lets get five non-attractive guys who can't sing, a couple of cheap pre-fabricated tunes, and go record a studio album. Talk about a joke. Only in America could this be a hit. I guess the joke is on me though, because the tunes are kinda catchy. I could have been a Backstreet Boy myself, but I am semi-attractive and can almost carry a tune. Oh well, what could have been.""Larger Than Life"" and ""Don't Want You Back"" are two of the better songs songs on the album. The other tracks don't amount amount to much. If you can find a single containing the above two tracks I suggest you buy it and save your money for the next boy band to come around."
3,ummm so-so,"hi! ok as u know if you read my nsync review, i'm a big nsync fan. i used to be a big bsb fan, but thhey're like getting old. also none of them are cute except for brian, and he's MARRIED! so if i were you i wouldn't bother spending the money on this cd cause there 1st one was way better! this cd has no really quality songs on it, and there absolutly nothing you can dance to! ( i luv dancing ) well, thanx for listening to my opinion! ttyl ( maybe)"
5,Go BSB!,"The Backstreet Boys are a great vocal group! They are back and better than ever! I love this album and i think that any BSB fan would too! Infact i used to hate them, then i heard ""I WANT IT THAT WAY"", and boom! It was like an instant change of mind! I got the album and now i'm a hardcore fan; I mean i just can't put their album down, their album is defenintely a must! So if you know someone who doesn't have their abum, get it for them! It would make a great x-mas, b-day present! One word to describe their album: FANTASTIC! Don't listen to those people who say they don't know how to sing, because they probably just don't like the boys! They have great voices!"
5,mom,"I loved it and I'm a mother of one of their teeny bopper followers.My daughter played it for me thinking I would just roll my eyes,but they suprised me with the maturity and agility of their voices.I strongly reccomend this cd to all age groups."
5,The Backstreet Boys are back-but were they ever really gone?,"The Backstreet Boys are back again, but this time, they aren't proclaiming it in a song which has won their fame along with the others on their 10x platinum debut album in the US. This time, there's a new sound. One so powerful it can make you laugh, cry, and sing along (though you may not just to hear their voices serenading you through the speakers of your stereo.) Every fan should have this, and I bet they do by judging the record the album made by beating out Garth Brook's Double Live CD. I'm sure that the fans and they boys are both proud, and they should be. Even though I'm just a girl who has taken some of her time to express her feelings about her favorite artists, I pray that if your reading this just because your friend made you for one reason or the other, that you have gained some respect for these five guys who have given so many people so much hope."
1,BSB doesn't deserve to win the Viewers Choice Awards.. KORN!,"Okay you pimps and pimpettes! Grow Up man!! BSB can't even write their own songs, they don't play instruments!! if you want a real band.. Try Serial Joe and yes! KORN!! KORN KORN KORN KORN"
5,They're Backkkkkk!,"Backstreet are back with another great album. 1. Larger Than Life-Great upbeat song for the fans very cool. 2. I Want It That Way-My fave song amazing ballad 3. Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely-Well this is nice ballad not my fave 4. It's Gotta Be You-Cool upbeat song. 5. I Need You Tonight-Nice ballad by nick. 6. Don't Want You Back-Awesome song I really like it 7. Don't Wanna Lose You Now-Great ballad one of my faves 8. One, The-Awesome upbeat song . 9. Back To Your Heart-Kevin has done brilliant job on this song. 10. Spanish Eyes-This song is good 11. No One Else Comes Close-Not my faves too slow 12. Perfect Fan, The-this song is so nice."
4,My First Boy Band Album,"This was my first boy band album. I was about 14 years old and since then i never stop listening to them. My fav song on the album is ""don't wanna lose you now"" at the time I was going through my parents separation/divorce which killed me on the inside. And as a kid I wanted to do things to end it all but I learn to turn to music and writing. After all these years I still listen to that song because it best describe what i was going through during those days.Every day I kept it in my cd player on repeat. But now the cd crack into millions of pieces because i was trying to burn it.but over all i like the album."
4,Good CD,"Some of the best of the Backstreet Boys. I'm a DJ and the song ""Perfect Fan"" is popular for either father-daughter or mother-son dances at wedding receptions."
5,That's the best one!,Hey! I'm from Brazil and I just like to say the boys have improved a lot since their first album. Congratulations! I love all the musics from Millennium.
2,Can we get yet ANOTHER slow song?,"The CD started out halfway interesting, the Daft Punk sample was pretty cool. The first track actually got my attention. Then track #2, which we all had heard before, was ok. Then the whole Cd went downhill. Not ONE good dance song after track 1. Good grief....at least I didn't pay for this cd."
5,Only 5 stars? Why not more?!,"This CD is DaBomb! I love it! How come we can only give it 5 stars? I'd give about 15!!You should all buy it, it's definately worth it!"
5,Millenium,"One of my all time favorite cd's, lost the last one in a car flood and play it for hours on end"
3,Lots of Bland Ballads but Some Good Songs,"There are many bland ballads on here and a lot of love songs. I think the best song by far is ""The One."" I have liked that since it came out."
5,This album is good,"Their first album was a starting point for them but this one got them up there(past nsync i can say).Great songs on it include Larger than Life, I want it that way,Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely, Dont want You Back, It gotta be you.....the group is good and i recommend this album to anyone"
1,"Please, You call this music?","Ok, 5 guys who have some potential are completly drowning in the same tired melodies over and over again. I think if the boys could try a new melody and some lyrics they actually understand, they might be ok. But in this album, you've got a bunch of guys singing about somebody else's life and dancing to gain the attention of America's girls betweeen 8 & 15. If you want to have an album that all of us will love, play your instruments, write your music, and take the focus off your looks. Overrated? I think so."
1,Mega commercial heartbreakers,"The typical profile of their fans must be 14-year old girls desperately in love with at least one of the members. How disappointed they'll be. This is not music for me. This is just as commercial as music can be. Hence the music is transformed into a substitute for anything. Try listening to some real music like Marvin Gaye , The Commodores with Lionel Richie, Bee Gees, Jonathan Butler or Barry White. These are at least, great musicians, producers or singers. How often do you hear Spice Girls on the radio in these days? BSB will certainly also be forgotten in two years!"
1,Lamer than life,"This CD is for losers. It has almost no sound and has no power, aggression or variety. It only talks about love, that's it. Come on, heavy metal talks about a variety of different topics. Give rock a chance before you spend your money on this total waste of plastic. Believe me, this album is NOT recommended. Try Slayer or Metallica or something with power instead, okay!"
2,The Truth,"I am certainly not the one to dismiss this album as a stupid, teeny-bopper, air-headed album. But in all honesty, all their songs seem to be slight variations from the previous ones. I give them credit for being great performers, but the lyrics are so neurotically simple that I can never get into their songs. They are simply a fad that will go the way of NKOTB."
5,I'm a guy but I like there music!,"Most BSB-fans are girls and many guys hate them. I don't know why. I'm a guy and I think there music is pretty good. Some reviewers who are girls, gave 5 stars because they think that these guys are sexy. I gave 5 stars because there music is good. There music is REALLY GOOD! I especially like ""Larger than life"" and ""Show me the meaning of being lonely"". The rest of the album is also very enjoyable. BUY THIS IF YOU DON""T ALLREADY HAVE HAVE IT!"
1,yeah right!,"My best word of advice, don't go near it. If you want to listen to sappy, all-identical songs with not one ounce of originality or authenticity, go right ahead, be my guest. But so you know, this CD doesn't deserve the one star I gave it, and if it were possible I would give it less,much much less. Every song is the same,whining and not one song has areal instrument in it, so if you still want it go ahead but I wouldn't advise it"
2,Not much different from their last one.,"I was a huge BSB fan for a long time, but they are really starting to get boring. When I bought this CD I expected something a little different, maybe more R&B or something like that. But what it is is mostly ballads, with a few recycled dance songs thrown in. Overall, nothing original, save your fifteen bucks and go buy Red Hot Chili Peppers 'Californication' instead."
2,"Average at best, but mostly mediocore for the high price.","Honestly! I know this may be offensive to BSB fans but honestly, when the craze has worn off you will be able to understand(I used to be a teen-ager and had my crazes too). I believe that it is mostly psychological why the Backstreet Boys are so popular. I believe marketing tactics and glossy art work as well as fairly hansome faces are the driving force behind the BSB craze(that is what sold me on the cd. It always works but now I feel that I need to speak objectively since the record company has elected to take advantage of BSB fans by pumping up the price far more than these boys are worth).At best this album rates average with ""The Perfect Fan"" being perhaps the most emotive and thought-provoking song. ""Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely"" does show some sense of maturity. ""Larger Than Life"" is a rollercoaster ride and very much rates high for it's infectious and exciting blend of rock and pop but still..."
5,Outstanding CD,I readily awaited the release of this CD and absolutely loved it. I can't wait for their next album in September.
3,Nick 's got game,it's the best cd in the world (exept for their others) i enjoyed the way they sing its magnificant. i wish i could meet nick.
1,Gimme a break!!,"When these guys first came out with ""Quit Playing games..."" I thought they were decent, but ever since then they've fallen down a steep slope. They're like a cheap imitation of Boyz to Men, and they don't know how to sing, either. I've got to admit that at least they're better than Hanson."
1,OK...enough already.,"When these guys came out with their first song, I thought it was okay, but all their songs are exactly the same. The only reason they play their songs anymore is because of immature, adolescent girls who like 25-year-old pretty boys who can somehow sing and dance at the same time (oh my god!!!). These fans don't know jack about music. But if these guys are making some money, getting some fame, and giving the little girls something to drool over, I give them props."
5,Best CD So Far,"This is the best cd of theirs so far. But I am sure that there will be more and better ones to come. It has so many touching songs. The one that always makes me want to cry is ""The Perfect Fan."" It is so sweet that Brian wrote this song for his mom. I love this cd and I suggest for everyone who hasn't got it to go out and buy it today."
5,Lovely,I love every song except Spanish eyes Its too slow I love all their voices on the record Its wicked
5,IT'S DA BOMB!!!!!!=),"I love this CD!! It has great songs and it was a lot more mature than the last album. My favorite song is ""It's Gotta Be You"" because it is sooo groovy!! It also has a song written by Kevin and one by Brian. Any Backstreet Boys fan will love this CD. So get it. NOW!!! ^_^"
1,The bright side is that it won't last for long.,"I'm not going to question the musical tastes of those who enjoy this sort of music, but if you're looking for music with substance then this isn't it. There's a reason why no one anywhere listens to New Kids On The Block and never will again - because it's worthless. These bands are destined to fade into the background of music history, obscured somewhere in disco's lost shadow. This is a band that exhibits not one single unique quality, shred of thought, or ounce of musical ingeniuity. Plug any quintet of average white boys into a multi-million dollar music machine and this is what pops out. Utter garbage."
5,I WANT IT THAT WAY IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!,"The new Bacstreet Boys: Millennium CD is exellent! I like the song, ""I Want It That Way."" I saw a video once and the location of that song is at an airport. I saw a sign in Hong Kong and it was only shown for construction. They also have that CD in Hong Kong."
5,"This CD is pretty ""tight""","I just borrowed the new BSB CD Millenium from my cuz 2day... I'm thinking of buying it. The songs are very how should i say it, moving. They have nice beats, nice rhthyms and everything else. I think this is a very good boy group. (Considering I'm a boy that's not supposed to like them) Well, I hope my sis gets the CD because i wanna listen to it and my cuz is getting my CD today! (Wow a 1 day long borrow! AMAZING!!!!!)I think you should get Millenium if your shopping for a new CD"
4,Surprisingly great CD!,"I'm not particulary a BSB fan, but i heard my friend's CD and luved it! Every song was well done. my favs are ""I need u tonight"", ""back to your heart"", ""perfect fan"" and ""dont want u back"". they are a very talented group."
3,Techno.... UUHHHHGGG!!!!,"Lately alot of good songs have been coming out and amazingly BSB are still on the top. The first single ""I Want It That Way"" seemed like it was already a chart topper before it was even put on the radios. I give BSB good credit for how successful they are. Their style of music could be a little more original. Techno music I have never really liked, we are in the 90S not the 80s."
1,You'll need earplugs for this one,"If you ever heard one of this album's songs on the radio, you just heard the whole CD. All the songs talk about love(and sound bad). Also the lyrics to 'I Want it That Way' make no sense. Won't anyone ever get sick of these cheesy manufactured prettyboy bands?"
1,Horrid,"It's a good thing that by this time next year no one will remember these guys, cuz im already trying my hardest to forget their name."
3,Great CD......for a boy band,"This is one of the better CDs of the boy band phenomenom, but i just hate the fact that it has too many slow songs. i loved 'Larger than Life', 'It's gotta be u', 'Dont want u back' and 'the one', but the others are good songs, but not what im looking for in a group that is known for high tempo songs. Good CD, i recommend it for fans, but too boring i think...."
3,Comended their Writers for doing an OK job.,"Well.....I thought that the second song was really very good...I commended their writers for doing ok job. But the rest of the cd started slipping. Well it was generally okay....but there would be alot more soul in their music is they played their own instruments, and wrote their songs..it would make the impression that they were doing it cuz they love it, rather than becuase they want the money."
4,Backstreet Men,"Most of the songs on this CD have mature lyrics and delivery any age can relate to. I especially liked ""Back To Your Heart"". The lyrics are simple, yet give the listener a complete sense of the longing and regret the writer obviously felt. The hard-edged ""Don't Want You Back"" is a great song about seeing a relationship for what it really is. Nick's voice has matured well, giving him credibility on the love and loss songs that he lacked on the self-titled CD (in the eyes of those no longer teen-aged, i should say). Each of these 5 guys has a tremendous voice on his own; together they are amazing. The Backstreet Boys should be proud of this effort."
5,I think that it is the best CD that they have had!,I think that thisd is the best Cd! I also think that they are going to go alot far that they have already. I also think that Brian is the best guy on earth!!
5,AJ IS SO FLY!!!!!!!!!! SO IS HOWIE!!!!!!!!!,THIS CD HAS SO MANY GOOD SONGS ON IT IT ALSO HAS GREAT PICTURES OF THEM IN THE COVER !!! I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT IN THE BEGINNING THEY WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THIS ALBUM . AJ AND HOWIE ARE MY FAVORITE. ANYWAYS IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD YOU HAVE TO GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!GOOD LUCK TO THE BACKSTREET BOYS AND A BIG SHOT OUT TO MY HOMEGIRLS--- DIANNE WHO IS THE ONE WHO INFLUENCED ME TO KNOWING ALL THE WORDS TO THE SONGS AND MY HOMEGIRL LAURA I LOVE YOUS!!!!!!!!!
3,Could've Been Better,"I like the Backstreet Boys and this CD, but I was just a little disappointed. While the guys' voices have matured, I don't like their lyrics as much. A couple of songs in the front and middle of the CD were sang well, but the lyrics were stupid. There were times when I found myself wondering, ""Just what are they talking about?"" My favorite tracks are 9, 10 and 11. Nick's solo song, I Need You Tonight, was sweet, but it dragged. By the way, am I being paranoid, or did every Backstreet Boy but Kevin have a solo song?"
3,OK,"Now, What I need to say is this: The Backstreet Boys aren't musicians. They are just a pre-packaged group of guys who just sing songsthat are written for them. Now, while their songs may be somewhat catchy and they may sing well, I don't believe all the credit that they are getting. There are so many talents out there that don't get recognized enough or at all. And then there are a bunch of backstreet Boys clones out there, but I will admit that they are the best of them. While this is not my type of music, I do give them credit for their singing skills, buyt just have to point out that they are way overrated. If you don't believe me, just ask yourself one question. Do you honestly believe that these guys would be as successful if they weren't as good looking? Wouldyou like them as much? Just ask yourself that one question."
1,NO STARS IT'S AS AWFUL AS THEIR FIRST! CD IS BORING,WHEN I LISTENED TO THIS CD (FEW BITS). I REALIZED THAT I CAN DO THIS TOO . IT'S AMAZING HOW PEOPLE WITH NO TALENT BECOME POPULAR? I MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO GET A RECORDING CONTRACT! HEY GIRLS! IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO REAL MUSIC LED ZEPPELIN AND PINK FLOYD ARE THE BANDS TO GET INTO!
3,You Could Do Worse,"Admiteddly, unless you are heatedly anti-Top 40, 'I Want It That Way' is one great pop song. 'Larger Than Life' also excites in the same way, but we can all be honest here and say that had the Backstreet Boys not come around, the world of music (especially if you look into the future, say 5 years) would not have been greatly affected. There's no ground-breaking music, no mind-blowing message in the lyrics. Sometimes, you don't need that though, and that's why Backstreet Boys succeed, for better or for worse."
2,Show me the meaning of a waste of money.,"Okay, so they had a massive radio hit with ""I Want It That Way."" Have you listened to the lyrics of this song? It's obvious English is a second language for the writer of the song. You want what what way? Right.The wrong mix of ""Larger Than Life"" is here. This one is too thin. There's no thump to it. Should have included the ""Video Mix"" which is available on import. The words are kinda cheesy, but it's got a great beat and an interesting arrangement, despite the clutter of the crowd noise.Aside from that, the CD is junk. I know, I know, it's for little kiddies who haven't grown to appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into the art. BSB need to keep it real on the next album. Kill the whiny synths. Get some real drums, piano, and some nice guitar work. More organic, earthier. And work on the vocals, please."
5,Backstreets Best,"I thought Millennium was great,it was one of the best albums all year.The sound was great,lyrics really movded you and made you and made you feellike they were talking to you."
4,Wonderful CD!-Definetely better than 'Backsteet Boys'!,"I really liked Millenium. I normally prefer artists such as Limp Bizkit or Korn, but all the hype about this CD made me want to see what they were all about. I was surprised that they had any harder beats, such as Larger Than Life, Don't Want You Back, and It's Gotta Be You, because everything I've heard is that they were bubble-gum pop artists. I really like that they wrote some of the songs on the album. One thing I think they could have used would be more songs with harder beats. But that's just my personal opinion. I think that anybody should give them a try, and go buy 'Millenium'!"
1,"One word, Sucks !!!","To all of you BSB lovers out there, you only like them because their hot and not for their music possibly because their music sucks. I just wanted to let you all know that N Sync is 10 times better!!!!"
4,For All With an Ear for Music,"This album is great--and you don't even have to be a teenybopper to listen to it! Who says that the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC should only have fans that are under the age of 18? I mean, give me a break, people. There are plenty of full-grown adults out there who dig this kind of music.My most favorite songs on this CD would have to be ""I Want It That Way"", ""Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely"", and ""Don't Wanna Lose You Now"".Although the Backstreet Boys are not the same as *NSYNC, that doesn't mean they can't sing well. So why does everybody, especially critics, constantly slam these guys? I just don't understand it.If you haven't bought a copy of this CD yet, then what are you waiting for? Fish out that wallet of yours from your pocket and go make a purchase! I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
5,Best they ever had,"This cd is the best Backstreet CD they have ever made. The first cd was ground breaking of course, but you can tell they have matured in a positive way. All of the song are melodic and heartfelt. One of the best cd's I have ever owned. I am a strict Rap and Hip Hop person, and I'm proud to say that this cd is always in my car cd player."
2,I want it my way,"Their cd is good dance music, if you happen to like it. They've got some good tunes, I like especially the hit song ""Larger Than Life"", which gets me to a good mood."
5,WOWWIE!,"I have always been a fan of the BSB,and I thought this was am amazing album, but now that I have met them several times and have talked for hours with them on the phone and on the inter net, I KNOW this si an amazing album. It took them a long time to perfect this and get it to where they wanted it to be heard by all their fans. they are great guys and want all you fans out there to know that they appreciate all your help and that you are not fans, you are friends. ~*Wendy*~"
2,Utter filtered garbage,"Wow, you can sell anything to kids when you have a huge marketing budget and some fresh faces.I'm going to keep this short. I don't care for boybands, only a couple of them have anything to offer a person with any developed music tastes. This album sounds like it had the effort of a couple of people on keyboards jamming for a week. Nothing new, just flashy images. Gave it an extra star though because it kept a couple of nine year olds shut up for an hour."
3,if you look beyond the image they have very good songs & even better voices,"i never was a fan of the BSB or boy bands but I admit I like some of their songs & they have excellent, soulful voices (maybe Nick still needs some voice lessons.lol) i like them bcz they don't have a cookie-cutter image like N'Sync & most other boy bands. they remind me more of Boys 2 Men, like a group of guys that can really sing, not a boy group. They seem like men to me instead of boys. my faves on this album in order:1. I want it that way2. Show me the meaning of being lonely3. Larger than life"
4,Such a Guity Pleasure,"I will never tell anyone that knows me personally this but, i listen to this album at least once a month. What can i say, its all infectious. My favorite track is ""Back to your heart"" track by track it never wears down. sure they dont write their own music or play instruments but having good vocals isnt easy either and on this album, the vocals are perfect"
4,An 'N Sync Fan Says 'It's Good',"I am a huge 'n sync fan and don't know why I'm even writing this review. I bought the Millenium CD just for the hit 'I Want It That Way'. I ended up loving almost every song (exceptions: i need you tonight, no one else comes close, back 2 your heart, don't wanna lose you now). Their talents have totally improved since their last album. They don't sound like whiny 5 year olds anymore. I wasn't expecting too much because I hated the first one. It was too whiny, and all the songs were kind of ""I want your sex NOW"" sort of things. Kind of like 5ive. Well, I still think 'N Sync rocks, but I have a much higher opinion of the BSB. Thanx for reading.PS I hate that people are calling them boy bands and they're exactly the same, don't you? I mean, that's like saying that Mase and Puffy are the same. HELLO! It's the same style of music that's all. So get off their backs."
5,Backstreet's Back and here to stay--It deserves 10 stars,"Wow!!! What words to say about the five hottest guys on the face of this earth? I love this cd and i suggest that everyone who likes pop should purchase this album. Spanish Eyes and It's Gotta Be You and Show Me the Meaning Of Being Lonley are my personal favorties, but i love them all!!! They are so wonderful that I dont understand why they are catogorized as a boy band at all...Sure they call themselves the Backstreet BOYS...but their growth from the last cd makes them seem like Backstreet Men. In other words.....if you can buy one cd make it this one!!!!"
3,I was looking for a little more!,"i jus thave to say that they're a great group first of all, but I don't think they did their best on this cd.I thought that the frist 5 songs were really good but as you listen futher into the cd they're songs become slow and some what dull.They needed more danceing music to make it ""5"" stars.I think that they will be really talented when thay write their own songs."
1,CAUTION!!!! NOT TO BE CONSUMED BY HUMAN BEINGS!!!,"I'd rather listen to ....Old Mcdonald has a farm....ia...ia..oooo.... That's a muuuucccchhhh better song...Listening To B'Boys songs will decrease your IQ... and increase your stupidity..,....Stay away from music like this!!!!..."
3,I personally can't tell its the BSB,When i was listening to my friends CD i asked myself 'does this sound like BSB's other album?'i anwsered 'no' it doesn't sound the same. Music wise. maybe because they wrote some of the songs or maybe because their voices somehow changed. whatever the reson it doesnt sound like teh BSB I recongize. thats what I think.
3,Mostly Slow Soft Songs,"This CD was OK. Most of the songs were slow songs that had never been heard of before. They really only had 2 or 3 fast beat dance songs. I expected more then what they did. They could have done much better then they did. For some reason most of the songs did not make sense to me. But, it is a good CD to buy because it will soon be really popoular in a the whole way, not just a few songs."
3,OK CD,"I got this CD the first day it came out, but with all of the hype surrounding the release, I thought it would be better. It's an OK CD."
1,Horrible,"This is one of the worst CDs ever made. It sounds exactly like every other teen idol band around. Exe:N'Synk, Five ect. Some people say that people like me are jelous of them. Untrue. Girls like Fred Derst, and I don't care, I am a fan of Limp Bizkit, but what gets me mad is that the Backstreet Boys are getting by on their looks, and despite total lack of talent, they make millions of dollars, and sell out huge venues, while there are many unsigned bands out there with plenty of talent trying to make it in the music industry, but aren't. If you want to, take my advice, and avoid Millenium at all costs."
5,Well...........,".....I really enjoyed listening to every song. There were 3 fast songs, 2 medium tempoed songs, and 7 slow songs. They are all very catchy. Very enjoyable and great to dance to. I think if you havn't already, you should definatley get it. Adults and children like it together! If you liked ""Bakstreet Boys"" you will love this. Thank you very much for reading this, have a nice day."
4,NO ONE ELSE COMES CLOSE,I'LL BE OVER THE HILL IN OCTOBER AND I FOUND MYSELF LISTENING TO THEIR CD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. MY HUSBAND THINKS I'M CRAZY BUT I'M LIKE GOING BACK TO MY HIGH SCHOOL DAYS. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEIR NEXT ALBUM. I EVEN FOUND MYSELF READING THEIR OFFICIAL WEB SITE AND GOT VERY AMUSED READING THEIR BIOGRAPHY. WISHING THE BSB MORE SUCCESS.
5,The Best Yet !!!,"This album was best yet to me. The others were good but this had more up tempo songs such as ""Don't want you back"" and ""Larger than life""Which is dedicated to all fans. It wasen't as good at first but it all started to sink in and now I think it's best of the 3 ablums they've released The cover is also really good to me they look like gods and the pictures also look really good A MUST BUY !!!!!!"
1,Isn't their fifteen minutes about up???????????????,"When you look at the top of the music charts and the top two albums are the Backstreet Boys and Ricky Martin, it shows that garbage sells. When all of the teenage girls who buy this grow up they will be a distant memory. (New Kids on the Block, Menudo, Shawn Cassidy, etc.) My advice to them is to invest their money wisely because it will be gone soon. Saying this is music is like saying Velveeta is cheese and Spam is meat. Technically it is, but not really. Do yourself a favor, open up your mind, buy Dave Matthews, Metallica, Bob Marley, (people who actually write their songs and get this: Play instruments too!!!!)"
5,BEST CD EVER,This is so good of a cd. I love it so much. I listen to it all the time I even bring it to school with me so I can hear the BSB voice. I love how the BSB write almost all the songs on the cd. i love thetrack number 6. if u ever get a chance to but it.. BUY IT!!
5,The Best Yet,"I have this CD and it is the greatest that they have came out with. Backstreet have gone far and above the last CD and I don't know how they will top this one with their next one. The best song?.....""Don't want you back"" :-)"
4,Can't believe I liked it ... but I did!,"I know, it's hard not to make fun of the Backstreet Boys and compare them to other annoying boy bands like NKOTB. But I really liked ""I Want It That Way"" when I heard it on the radio, so I bought this CD on a whim. I ended up enjoying the whole thing, almost against my will. So this music is palatable to twentysomethings, after all. Give it a try!"
1,THIS GROUP IS WACK!!!!!,Once again they have made a wannabe soulful CD. I don't know what they are trying to accomplish but I wish they would give it up. Their songs are weak and don't really say much. Basically they appear to be trying to sound like something their not. Don't waste your money.
5,This is the best!!!!!,This Cd is one of the best The Backstreet Boys have ever made!All the songs are wonderful.There arent many fast songs which was a bit of a disapointment.But there are many beautiful slow songs.I especially like *I need you tonight* and *Back to your heart*.And Dont want you back is a awesome song that is something different from them!
4,BIG STEP,"The boys have really come out with their new album and captured many more new fans, including the guys. Even if the guys doubt it, they can't help sing the songs off the radio to themselves, because of their new sound. This is definitly a big step for the boys."
4,"It's good, but it's almost over.","The CD is actually surprisingly good! I loved the first BSB cd and this one measures up pretty close to the first one. I Want It that Way is an awesome song and I like thier ""new"" look. Most every song on this album is really good! But time is quickly closing in on these guys so enjoy them while they are hot!"
3,errrrrrrr.ok,Um i think this cd is going to bring a fall to the group. It is ok but it souds exactly the same as all their other songs.
5,truly a one of a kind cd,"The brand new cd by the Backstreet Boys is total great.The songs are great, the music is great& the guys sound great. I read a review yesterday on this cd that really made me mad,so now i'm giving my review.There is so much talent in this group it is unreal.It's not easy to write music but Kevin and Brian both did wonderful jobs at it.You guys make it seem easy to do ,but I know different.To all of you who read this , go buy the cd.$14.00 is a small price to pay for such a good cd.You'll be glad you bought it.I am!!I only have one more suggestion ,Kevin needs to sing more. he has an amazing voice , not to many people realize that!!!!"
5,Awesome!,"This CD is awesome! There are no possible improvements. I got this CD almost as soon as it came out, and since then I haven't stopped listening to it. Each song is done to perfection and the boys have done an amazing job on their sophomore release. More music like this, please!"
1,Looks doesn't make good music,"The only reason that people liked them because of their looks, they care less about the music. Video Game music is a lot better than this music.If The Backstreet Boys are fat and old, No one will ever listen to them in the first place. Thats what wrong with music today. People care more about what they look like than the music itself.I always hear ""They're so hot!"" from a couple of teenage girls. WHOCARES, WHAT ABOUT THE FREAKING MUSIC MAN! IS THAT IMPORTANT?Long time ago, this is an true story. I've dated ab girl who is an pretty person. But she break my heart.Don't judge a person what they look like. Thats just plain wrong. We listen to the music because of the music. Gezzzzz... whats this world coming to?"
5,It's excellent!,"The BSB's new cd Millennium is a energy packed thrill ride.There best yet.Fullof life ,and love it's everything a cd should be.The songs express so much of or modern day life.With songs like ""Larger Than Life"".Which tells the truth about being famous,and the things it brings.A five stars.SO CHECK IT OUT!!!!!! peace"
5,I think that this Cd is the best yet from BSB they rock,On this cd the backstreet boys show there real talent and they show that they have grown musicaly this cd is the best yet from them and Im sure that there will be more coming from them in the future.
2,It gets annoying,"There has been so much hype about the CD but when you hear it, it's a total let down. All the songs are slow besides maybe two and they all sound exactly the same. ""I Want It That Way"" and ""Larger Than Life"" are basically the only two singles they probably can come up with off ""Millenium."" My hopes were up to listen to it, but now I feel kinda stupid that I paid to buy it."
3,"Some good songs, some disappointing ones","I really do like the Backstreet Boys and their new single ""I Want It That Way"" but some songs on this CD were just really boring. I would say either get it or don't get it, but don't spend a fortune on it. Granted some songs are good, though."
2,an alright effort,"i got this cd on the 1st day it was released but i am pretty disappointed. The song ""I want it that way"" and the boys vocal are the only good things about the album. The rest of the album sounds alright when u first listening to it but don't really make u want to listen to them again. The lyrics are very stupid as well (esp .Larger than life and Spanish eyes) There are very few hits in this album compare to the last one as well. My advice is to wait and buy the cd singles only."
4,Bought it for my niece; ended up with my own copy!,"Yeah, I had seen a couple of the videos, heard some of the songs on the radio, but I was not a fan. After hearing ""Millennium,"" I became one. Sure, the guys have benefited from their packaged look and sound, but haven't other earlier ""boy bands"" been pretty much the same?I can add nothing more than what has already been said by others except, ""Give credit where credit is due. The Backstreet Boys' 'Millennium' has come! Their time is now!'"""
1,Backstreet Boys?,"These ""musicians"" (if you could call them that) should not be allowed to record music. They must lip sync everything. They're basic purpose is to sell millions of CD's to teenage girls. BSB don't care about music at all! If you ask any one of their fans, the girl(obviously) would say: ""Oh my gosh, because they're so hot!"" Backstreet Boys' 15 minutes of fame is way over. Am I the only one who knows that?????"
1,15 minutes of fame,"Sorry, but most of the fans are girls who only listen because of what the guys in the band look like."
1,Backstreet Boys are the most unorigional band,The Backstreet Boys are an extreamly unorigional band with a manufactured sound.
5,It is SO great!!!,"I love Backstreet Boys and I just want to make a little spot to review their CD---well not the whole CD 'cause it's not out yet. But after hearing their lastest single ""I Want It That Way"" and the clips on Amazon.com I can tell this CD is going to be one of the best ever!"
1,Millenium,I think this album has no diference in the old one. Their voices have not impoved and their voices dont work together.
1,Sorry but i don't dig it,O.K i've listened to the CD and I almost fell asleep. Slow after slow same old same old they are doing the same music over and over again. there is no evolution in their music at all. If anybody got to listen the Backstreet back CD(canadian version) it is the same stuff as Millenium. The version of INTY is much better live than on the CD. I think BSB should spend less time whining on national T.V.about other boybands cause they look pretty pathetic when they do that and spend more time on their music cause it's suffering from some real originality. Bottom line if you need something that is deeper and edgier and that can make you dance avoid this CD at all cost!
2,ok,"i liked it when it first came out, they did a bad job of covering joe's song ""no one else comes close"""
3,Ok,"When I first got the CD I thought it really would be better than the first, as most people had said. After I listened to the songs, I have to say I'm disappointed. The lyrics don't seem 'deeper' to me and the only songs I like are Larger than Life and I Want It That Way and maybe Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely. There are way too many slow songs and the first CD at least had some songs about music but as I wrote, almost every song is a ballad and romantic. Also, Spanish Eyes sounds like a boy visiting Mexico and falls in love with a girl and what I don't like about it is that it doesn't seem like true love to me. Only one or two songs seem like the boy is facing true love. The rest seems like some high school crush."
2,BACKSTREET BOYS ARE MEDIOCRE AT BEST.,"The dirty blond lead singer (don't know his name) is wasted in this group. With such fabulous vocals he should be out on his own. The group is mediocre at best with run of the mill ballads, and pop tunes, all I can say is boring. They are the strongest of the male groups, no doubt that is why I give it 2 instead oF 1 stars. The likes of N Sync, 98 Degrees, and Five will fade fast. What keeps the Backstreet Boys alive is vocals and personality. Otherwise this is just another stale mate."
2,Blech,"Okay, first of all, I USED to really like the Backstreet Boys, but I do not like this cd. I'll admit at first it was okay, but I'm so sick of it. All the songs sound the same. Nick is always flat, so he never blends. Some of their songs sound like they've tried to cover up the vocals with the background music. Honestly, if I try to listen to this cd I get a headache. It isn't as great as some people say. Even when I was a diehard fan of the BSB, it wasn't great. I'm not trying to be rude, but unless you're either tone deaf or don't care what you're listening to, you probably won't like this cd. Just stick with the singles 'cause those are the only things worth listening to."
1,BSB???,"After hearing rave reviews of the Backstreet Boys from ""professional"" reviewer Ricky Wright, I decided I might as well get this CD. Can you say mistake??? Except for the sweet strains of ""I Want It That Way,"" this CD was a complete disappointment. The vocals are weak, the songs AREN'T catchy...the only good thing that came out of this is that it put me on *N Sync."
1,Can you say...BAD street boys!!,"I understand that there a lot of people out there that like the backstreet boys, but I am not one of them!! I personally think that the backstreet boys are pure garbage!! I'm practically trying to give away my cd's!!! HORIBBLE!!!! They are a bad influence to our young society!!! They are putting bad vibes into our world!! STOP THE MADNESS!!"
1,It all sounds the same... probably because it IS! $$$!,"The backstreet boys music is irritating. Maybe if you're a teenage girl who feels faint everytime they appear on TV, you'll like this album. I admit, they look good, but they sure as heck don't sound good. Whatever happened to music that MEANT something? These guys are all about money."
2,old news,"I think backstreet boys are getting old. I mean they r gettin married and stuff like that. There 1st cd waz sooo much better cuz they could relate to teens, now that they r older, they really cant relate. N SNC is da bomb now, and i know my friends and i agree, baskstreet boys r old and nysnc is new. Thats just how the entertaiment business works knowwattaimsayin? Anyways, My lil neice has this album and i listen to it and i dont like it, their first one waz good, heck i even have there 1st one a'ight peace"
1,prefabricated pop songs without a soul,"I think Millenium included only 2 pretty good songs: I Want It That Way and Larger Than Life. It was really hard for me to keep the melody of any other song of Millenium in my head for more than five seconds.The only thing the Backstreet Boys bring with this album is prefabricated pop songs without a soul. They didn't take any risks musically. They just did what we can expect from them. Also, The Backstreet Boys just co-wrote 4 songs out of 12 on Millenium. They are not writers like Hanson, another band who also has a young audience.I suggest you to buy ""The Soft Bulletin"" by the Flaming Lips instead of Millenium. The Soft Bulletin is probably the best pop album I heard last year."
1,Like all guys and girls in the late ninetys early thou's...,"i liked to jam this music. But you know that time is over now and this music is out and over with. Back streets back? Oh heeeeeck no... That means another few years of trashy dancing ' pretty boys ' that dunno what real music is! I actually can't believe i wasted those new millenium hours listening to this millenium CD ( wow.. cd name is millenium too.. wow.....? ) relaly though, there are only maybe 2 songs on here worth listening to once or twice then the CD should gather a few inches of dust and wait for you to listen to it again some time... a few years later"
5,Larger than life,"You thought their first was good, now hear their second it's GREAT. If you wont everybody rock n jammin to the beat try this. If this dont get everyone jammin I don't know what will. You'll like it, your mom will like it( how did you get that cd?), and your little sib will like it. No more "" Turn donw that music!"", now its "" hey, we can't hear it down hear!""."
3,"It used to be the best, but......","....this CD was the bomb, but I had a LITTLE BIT too much!(my advice is to not over-listen it!) My Faves are ""Larger than Life"", ""Show Me the Meaning of being Lonely"", and ""Don't Want You Back"". I get annoyed by ""Spanish Eyes"", ""The One"", and ""The Perfect Fan"" 24/7!!!! It's still a pretty good CD, though."
1,"Form, not substance.","I'll make it clear right now that these guys are good singers. However, it takes a little more than good singing and good looks to make a great album. The songs are overplayed, and probably will not stand the test of time. People do not like The Backstreet Boys for their music, but rather their appearance. Who knows, maybe one day these guys will surprise us all with a masterpeice. However, this album shows they are still first and foremost, bubblegum teenyboppers."
1,needs help,I think any one that would call this music needs real mental help and should see a shink asap.Music like this just makes you wonder what the world is comeing to.Why don't you all get a life and listen to some real music like Conway twitty or George Jones music that makes this country what is is today thank you.
1,I use it as a coaster,"This Cd is one of the worst Cd's I've ever heard. They are all SLOW songs except for like 3 of them. They need more fast pop music like *N Sync's No Strings Attached now those boys know what they are doing. I was so hyped for this Cd and I bought it when it came out. And I was dissapointed. I want music so I can dance to it. I wish there were no stars. The only good song is ""I want it that way"". Don't buy this Cd if you like fast music."
3,they are good but......,I give them 3 star just for the first 3 song. they are a good band but they are not like Boyzone. Boyzone are wayyyy better than the bsb. So if you like the pop music I believe that you gonna like Boyzone more than anyone else.
1,THE PARTRIDGES COULD FLY HIGHER THAN THIS TURKEY,The Partridge Family were never considered to be a real band (although they did receive a Grammy Nod as best new artist in 1970 for their vocal production). They were fun and unpretensious. The main problem with BACKSTREET BOYS and this CD is that this group started to believe their own hype. This CD did help murder (THANK GOD) the boy band sound! Place this in the discount bin beside your OTOWN. It is laughable to think a so called music critic from these boards believes JOHN LENNON could learn something from this prefab band! The BEATLES are still not considered dated after 40 years ~ The BACKSTREET BOYS were dated one month after this CD shipped to retail.
2,I only like one song,I like only one song and in math class everyone makes fun of the tell me why? song. The rest of the songs on this CD are boring and never even made it on the charts. None of the songs have a snappy beat so I wouldn't but this CD because I would only listen to one song.
1,BACKSTREET BLOWS ALRIGHT,Honestly the Backstreet Boys were always over rated. This CD blows the big one as well as all the others. If I could give it a negative 5 stars I would. Too bad that's not an option. Thank God their time has passed. At least I sure hope so.
5,The best yet,"This album is the best that the guys have made yet. There is a little something for everyone. The guys have been growing up the last few years and there music has been going with them. Millennium, is great you should go out and by it."
3,BSB new cd was alright,"The new back street boys cd was pretty cool, they started out with a samples of daft punk on one of their songs.However this cd isnt much different than their last cd and at times i though most of the songs sounded too familiar and repetitive. Back Street Boys are pretty good group with their nice voice and all. In my opinion i think Boyzone is a better group and probably out do any ballad by BSB hands down. If you dont believe me, you should check out their greatest hit cd that is coming out soon. Of course i dont need to tell you Brits out there about Boyzone"

If you dont believe me, you should check out their greatest hit cd that is coming out soon. Of course i dont need to tell you Brits out there about Boyzone"
1,Don't jump on the bandwagon,"I cannot understand how this album was so successful. I bought this album for the heck of it, thinking that maybe they would pleasantly surprise me. Unfortunately, this album put me to sleep within the first two tracks. All the songs reek of inane, trite teen filler. What's worse is that they all sound exactly the same! And what's with the whole album being montonous, maudlin ballads! *yawn* Their weak and painful warbling will have you wishing you had better spent your [money] on a some aspirin.Well, the only thing this CD has been useful for is as coaster on my coffee table."
1,Iron maiden rules,"if you like good music then do NOT buy this CD. If it is going to be soft than let it have meaning, let it have substance. I have no time nor tolerance for these wash-up pansies. That is all...."
4,It's better than their 1st but......,"Well this album is way better than their debut but it is overproduced, even though I like all of their songs. They just don't sound as good as regular bands like the Goo Goo Dolls, Sarah Mc Laughlan, etc live. It's good and the songs are catchy. I would recommend this CD but if you are picky on production then don't get it."
4,Backstreet boys BEGINNING,"If you've ever heard the Backstreet Boys self titled album you're view on this band may be all wrong. Millenium proves that. This group ofr gentlemen is ripping out of their boy-band stereo-type by making a revitalizing CD that consists of pop, dance, a little rap, and even a taste of latin. The songs are so varied it's hard to beleive they came from the wimpy little boys you've heard before. This CD is definately evidence that they've grown up and matured as musicians, not just as teen idols."
5,great buy!,"Backstreet Boys always manage to top the charts. Is it their great lyrics or catchy tunes? Who knows, but for the time being, i must say that ""i want it that way""is an amazing song, basically perfect. Although i am not a backstreet boy's fan, this album has really caught my eye and it consists of nice tunes and catchy beats. Backstreet Boys, if you are reading this (probably not!)then you should be really proud of your acheivments. Way to go!!!"
4,The Sophomore Effort,"I thought this album was a little disappointing. The beginning of the album was great. It caught my attention, but after song four or five, it slowly lost that attention. i loved the fact that everybody sang more on this disk, but there were too many ballads. I was hoping for something similar (not exact) to the first album. Their freshman attempt made you want to get up and get funky. Unfortunately, this CD just doesn't do this after a certain point. I like the BSB, and I am glad to have a new disk to listen to. However, I wish they would have made it a little more ""get up and dance""-able."
3,Pretty Good!,"I bought this today and I've listened to the whole thing already. ""I Want it That Way"" is definitely the best of all 12 songs. ""The Perfect Fan"" is a sweet idea, but still...Boyz II Men's attribute to their mothers was better. No offense, obsessed fans. You should buy this if only for the pictures on the inside cover!!"
4,"Out of all the boy bands, these guys are the best.","You may not believe this is coming from a guy. A guy that alsolikes Limp Bizkit, KoRn, Kid Rock, Nine Inch Nails... and a guy thatcan't stand 98 Degrees and Nsync. But when Larger Than Life comes on, I always listen and sing along. I don't know why I have this preference of BSB. Or maybe its just because two people I know look just like Brian and A.J. These guys were the first of the three (BSB, NS, 98D) and they had to take all the criticism because they were the first. They paved the way for NS and 98D. Now that they are back, they have every right to be praised for what they have done. This is a great album, and worth your money if you like pop/boy bands."
3,Ok BUT could be better,"I like the cd and all but did they know they can sing about other things besides love and their fans! I mean, Kid Rock is over there singin' about being a cowboy and Blink 182 is trying to figure out what their age is! BSB was { key word: WAS} cool, untill they forgot there are other subjects to sing about."
4,The Actual Content,"Well...i am a huge fan of the bsb, but this cd was actually quite a disapointment to what i was really expecting. They promised us all these great songs that actually didnt appear on the cd at all! I believe that they let us down on this one folks, but hey, we cant do anything about it now!And another thing: you'd think they would have realized that they sound much better on faster songs than they they will in slower songs. thats about all i have to say! :("
3,A so-so effort,"I must admit that i was disappointed with this cd. I really enjoyed the first cd with the dance songs and more upbeat tunes. This cd seems to be catered to young teenage girls, filled with slow romantic ballads and little else. But then again, I guess you do have to know your audience and they seem to have that down cold."
2,It all right,"I'm not a backstreet boys fan because there music isn't really great. It's not really even good. The only reason that there popullar because in the words of Dropkick Murphies ""todays general crowd places more enphasis on fashoin style and gossop than the actual music itself. I mean a band like the Misfits could be the greatest band in the world but they won't be the most popullar because they don't look like the type of band that would be with the crowd of today and they don't wear abercrobe and fitch. Everything is superficiafil and it makes me sick. The backstreet boys don't deserve the popularity that they get. Every song they make has to do with love. Love is a great emotion but what about pain sadness or just fun music that dooesn't make sense. I hope you enjoyed my thoughts."
3,"Good,not the best","My friend has this CD, and she loves it. She plays it everytime I come over. From what I heard, this CD is better for the kids who are 8, unlike BSB's other album... I still can't believe they'd do bad lyrics/subjects!"
5,"Backstreet Boys are the best, and we all know it!!","Backstreet Boys Were awesome from the beginning, and they're getting better! At first, I didn't think it was possible for them to get better, but they sure did! I wonder what the next album has in store for us! Remember always and forever - !BSB-4-LIFE!"
4,Backstreet Boys: Cool Teenybopper Music,"Before I was a devout hater of boy bands, but after all the radio play the Backstreet Boys got, it was hard not to start humming to their songs. Millenium, the Backstreet Boy's sophomore album, does show that the group has tried to push their musical style boundaries. With tracks like ""Larger Than Life"" and ""Don't Want You Back"", the group has started to explore a more funky style. But this album does go back to what the Backstreet Boys do best--slow songs about love, heartache, and devotion. This can get a little boring with the songs sometimes running into each other, instead of being distinct and individual. But because the Boys do these songs so well, the music lover can forgive them for it."
3,Not what we all expected,"Milennium was not the greatest. They have about three good songs on this cd. ""Backstreets Back"" seemed to have more harmony and rythm than this one. The Backstreet boys seem to have a new look. The funk sounds in ""Larger than Life"" are different than in ""Everybody, Backstreets Back"" However they have good songs on this cd such as: I want it that way, The perfect fan, and Don't want you back."
5,Wonderful for what it is!,"First, I want to tell everyone that I am a teenage girl so that is the first and foremost reason I was orginally drawn to the BSB. I just happen to love this new album. This album isn't suppposed to be life altering material. Gasp, they aren't going to be the next Beatles or other legends, but the album is great for what it is: a pop album that tells every girl what they want to hear. They aren't turning out classics, but that isn't the way this album should be judged. It should be judged for what it is intended to be: a lot of fun with songs that we teenagers can relate to our reality. I really like the song ""The One"" because that's how a lot of us (girls) want to be taken care of. Millennium is full of wonderful dance tunes and great slow songs. Let's not make the BSB into anymore or any less then what they really are: a great, wonderful, fun to listen to band, but not the be all and end all in music."
3,I thought it could be better.,"I didn't like the Backstreet Boys second album ""Millennium"" ,not only because of the totally cheesy title! I mean what's ""Millennium"", how original! But 2 other reasons, 1. I only like one song ""I want it that way"" (that's why I gave it an average score) 2. I loved the boys' debut album ""Backstreet Boys"", every song, so when I got ""Millennium"" I was so disappointed that it was totally un-original, and kinda corny. But this my opinion. So I hope no one is offended."
3,"Interesting,compeling,overwhelming,well done","This album is yet there second album and there best,so far.From beginning to end the album is listenable and you won't want to skip any tracks.From Larger than Life to The perfect fan,we stumble upon such gems as I want it that way, The one and Don't wanna lose you now.If i had to pick a low point it would have to be No one else comes close,musically.The middle ground would include Back to your heart and Spanish Eyes.I found my favorite songs on the album being ,i need you tonight and the perfect fan.Good.Good stuff."
1,If you are under the age of ten you will like it.,I really dont like this CD at all. I think that it is really childish. I think that the backstreet boys have been around to long and they are getting to be as old as New Kids on The Block.
1,What's the deal????,"Okay I don't know why everyone loves these 5 guys so much. They don't even write their own songs, so why are you giving them all the credit? All they do is sing them and I don't think any of them have an especially good voice. Come on they don't even play any instruments! All they do is show off by dancing and singing and thinking they are so awesome. ""I Want it That Way"" is the only decent song on the CD."
1,GAG ME!!!!,"Tell me, does anyone who isn't a twelve year old girl actually like these freaks? Their music is cliqued and just plain stupid. Who cares how they want it? What they NEED is something original. And a group haircut. The little groupies think they're cute? Didn't anyone happen to see the MTV Video Music Awards? Four of them wore suits that resembled garbage bags and the fifth wore a bra! I know they look like girls, but women's lingerie is not necessary. However, the saddest thing is that other groups desperatly want to be like them! Want a hint? It's not worth it."
5,BSB RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Backstreet Boys rule. They are so coll and have freat talent. They are all so hot especially Nick and Brian. I just fall in love with them when they sing. I am so glad they came out with another album finally. My favorite songs are ""Larger Than Life"", ""I Want It That Way"", ""Show me the Meaning in Being Lonely"", and ""It's Gotta Be You"". I recommend buying this CD you won't want to stop listening to it."
4,There old CD was better,"This CD was so cool, I loved Larger Than Life, I Want It That Way, It's Gotta Be You, Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely, and I Don't Want You Back. But still, I think they rushed it a little, cause the old CD had rocks the world so hard!"
1,"Bad looks+Bad Music=a cult following,& a #1 video on TRL!","People? I have a question... WHAT is SO special about the BACKSTREET BOYS?! I listened to this album song for song this summer via a friend, and... honestly, I guess I just don't get it. I found not even a speck of talent OR originality on the record! Even the people who write FOR them are lame! To me, all of the music is just a reminder of how terrible the early 90's were. I've heard it all before! And beside the point that they cannot SING, they can't even write, though they did TRY, which I will give them a bonus point for.But HONESTLY, people, are they really THAT hot? Their looks do nothing for me... I grew out of that teen heartthrob stage when I was,hmmm 11...and I'm only 14! Please, people, I urge you to listen to Real Bands with REAL TALENT... Try Unwritten Law!"
5,Fantastic!,"This is the best Cd that I have ever owned! The Millennium album is terrific with the 2 hot songs ""Larger Then Life"" and ""I Want It That Way"". If you love the Backstreet Boys as much as I do then you should definitly own Millennium!"
5,superb! by some gorgeous lads,Nick Carter is the most talented lad in the world and if anyone thinks differently then it proves their just jealous.The album is brilliant and is a great follow up from the first two albums.The solo's are a great way of showing how well each member of the band can sing and how all five of them together make the BACKSTREET BOYS what they are!
5,THE BEST ALBUM IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!,"EVERY single song on this album is an inspiration! If you wanna hear BSB at their best, you MUST get this CD! I LOVE the songs ""I Need You Tonight"", ""I Want It That Way"", ""Larger Than life"" and, actually I LOVE THEM ALL!!!!!! If you like music than you HAVE TO get this CD!! SERIOUSLY, it's the greatest in this world!!!!!"
3,its pretty good,"i've been a fan of bsb for about a year now, and after listening to ""millennium"", i was semi- dissapointed. but i gotta give them props for writing a bunch of the songs though. they need more upbeat jams! i'm cool w/the slow ones, i guess, but that's ALL there was. ""back to your heart"" was awesome though, good work, it probably coulda been better though."
1,"Do not buy this CD,it is a waste of time and money!","I have heard some of this of this CD and their old old one,I think that most of all their songs sound to much alike for me(that also goes for Nsync,98 degrees,youngstown ect.)and their music should not even fall into the catogory of popular music!This is not the kind of music that you can injoy or brag that you have it.It is pure GARBAGE! I had to give it a star not because they deserve it but because you must pick from 1-5 I picked the almost agreeable number!"
3,"Okay, but I've had better",Backstreet Boys seem to have taken a step back musically...their first two albums were great to listen to but this one nearly put me to sleep! I Want it That Way is certainly a great ballad but cannot be compared to their former slow numbers such as Quit Playing Games and As Long As You Love Me..
1,Can they sing ?,Can they sing? Yeah right! I would never buy this cd. My friend got it and said there was one good song. I don't even think it was good. Buy Nsync. I give that 5 stars.
2,What happened to originality people?,"This is a review from a guy that like's pop music, BUT unforunately Backstreet boys new CD is way far from originality, the beats are that of a teeny bopper medly. I've listened to the CD to try to like it but it didn't work. There are only about three song that are decent and one song that is cool. If you do want great music like a nice ballad, or up to beat party music, i suggest you swallow your pride and buy an NSYNC CD. Or at least go to their concert, its amazing what they can do. Sing, dance, song write, and play instrument, you'll be awwed for weeks. In retrospect, BSB's old CD was better."
3,Major disappointment!,"As an older Backstreet Boys' fan I wanted to like ""Millennium,"" wanted to give it a strong recommendation. As a music fan, however, I find it hard to do either. The boys' vocals are iffy at times and are usually overpowered by the musical accompaniment. In addition, the songs themselves are too bland and generic to generate much enthusiasm. Although I waited patiently from the first song to the last, the musical growth I expected on such a talented group's follow-up release never materialized. The songs are pleasant enough to listen to, but don't expect to find the same catchy quality here as on the previous release. Buy the BSB's latest if you're a fan. If you're not, don't expect ""Millennium"" to make you one."
5,Haven't heard a better one...,Not only is excellent. I think is the best production of all their CD's. The best songs are the first five. I liked it very much.
4,absolutely brilliant,"Obviously the boys are back...with a better, much matured album. I especially like the song Larger than Life, which is for the fans and the ballad Spanish Eyes...well, I'd say Millenium is worth checking out...even worth the money you paid for. Long live the boyz!"
5,a new up beat and fresh sound,"the backstreet boys have done it again! first they wow us with their first self titled album, then they do it again with millenium. all i have to say is keep it coming! great job boys!"
3,Backstreet Boys don't suffer from the sophomore slump,"Millenium carries some excellent songs, some of which are the best the Boys' have ever made. ""Larger Than Life"" and ""It's Got To Be You"" are great dance numbers, and ""I Want It That Way"" and ""The One"" are beautiful. Unfortunately, about half of the album is comprised of weightless, dull ballads that one can barely tell apart from each other. Exceptions to this are: ""Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely"" and ""The Way Back To Your Heart"". One really great thing about this album is that Kevin gets the chance to sing more, but unfortunately he still does not get as many parts as the other Boys. I was very glad to see that Brian cowrote several of the songs, and that Kevin cowrote one. I think those two can truly have successful careers after the Backstreet Boys phenomenon fades. Though it may be weighed down by listless ballads, Millenium is a must have for all Backstreet Boys fans."
2,Better than average for this genre,"I am 30 years old. I'm male. I will admit it, I like BSB. Well, sort of.Their first CD s%$ked, and I will not retract that! It s%$ked big time!The new CD is more mature and far better-written. Though few of the songs really stand out (like ""Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely"" and ""I Want It That Way""), the album is generally easy to listen to.BSB has proven that they have matured and have a more adult groove than 98 Degrees or N'Sync (both of those groups are still in the teeny-bop phase and I doubt they make it out of it). BSB may not survive much longer, as I'm sure that AJ, Nick and Brian will all move on to solo projects. Kevin and the other guy (name? 0k, so I'm not a HUGE fan...I can't even remember all their names) probably don't have voices good enough for a solo, so they'll eventually fade away.In all, this CD isn't bad (despite their being better groups out there) and is worth a listen, just don't expect any classics."
1,well... the cd cover was cool,"not much else was impressive though. as a whole the cd was pretty pitiful, melodies which were too syrupy for consumption and a pitiful attempt at appearing to be deep. the least these guys could have done was write their own songs. but... the photographer for the cover did a good job..."
5,BSB Rock!,"Ok Now to all of you who think BSB sux, I have something to say to you. These guys have been working hard, and now all the girls love them; I just think alot of people are jealous of their fame. Yes, they may only sing about fans and love but at least they have nice things to say and not some of that TRASH other bands are singing about!"
1,an embarrasement,The first thing you see when you buy this cd is four preppy boys dressed up to please mama.Thats about the same cover for all boy band cds. The strangest thing though is how much all the music sounds the same. With not so original ideas and terrible songs this cd is a mistake from the begining. If you must have a boy band cd though i would reccomend the new one from NSNC.At least there music is partway entertaning.MAMA BETTER SIT DOWN ON THIS ONE BACAUSE THIS CD AINT NOTHIN TO BE PROUD OF
1,Quite playing those tunes,Ok bsb is not a good example. They like have a million probs and want to spread them around with the world!!so ethier drop it or stop it because its really lame.
1,A yawner,"Borrowed a coworker's cassette so I could see what all the fuss was about...what I heard was boring lyrics, boring instrumentation, boring production and bland melodies. There's no unique personality to the songs, no uniqueness in the singing...I can think of literally hundreds of other acts out there that could sing these songs just as well, if not infinitely better. I'm not surprised they've sold tons of CDs...this stuff is ordinary and safe. Nothing even slightly challenging on the album. Nothing about it sets them apart from the pack, which(unfortunately) is what most listeners crave--music that sounds like they've heard it before. My coworker loves them...but then again, she's not into music...she's into songs--and yes, there is a difference."
1,"Beats for the money, there not real.","The only reason I'm giving this CD one star is because I can't give it zero. Where is the talent, the million selling talent? I guess simple empty lyrics that make 15 girls blush is the way to make $$$. Sheeeezz. Listen to some acual music, something to make you think. Something real."
1,"this is a product, like acne-medication aimed at teens","If you are a young female, your affinity for this group is the result of the fact that your are still maturing as an individual. As you begin to be able to see past your hormones and fantasies, perhaps you will understand my criticism of this group.This is not impassioned, personal music. It is a carefully marketed product. Demand more from your music. Demand that it be art, that it challenge you rather than appease you. Pop, bubble gum music can be both melodic, catchy, AND intelligent and truthful."
4,It's not just the little girls who like this one . . .,"I have to admit it--if the Backstreet Boys had been around twenty years ago when I was 13, I would have been screaming and plastering my room with their pictures too. As it is, I genuinely like this album, as do a lot of other adults (although some will only admit it with a gun to their heads). The guys can actually sing, the lyrics are a cut above what you might expect from a pin-up boy band (""Eyes like stone observe the trends""), and the arrangements are first rate (I dare you not to dance when ""Larger Than Life"" comes pounding over the speakers). The Boys appeal to adults too, even those who don't have swooning teens and pre-teens in the house, and that will be the secret of their longevity, long after the 'N Syncs of the world fade into obscurity. And they are all pretty cute, by the way . . ."
2,1 song worth 2 stars,This album I will give 2 stars because I have to admit it... I Want It that Way was a well written and sung song. But past that it's still just more boring meaningless pop to pass time. Nothing new just a money maker.
5,Better Than The First...,"Unlike *NSYNC, the Backstreet Boys open up with a song about appreciating their fans, and sign off with a ballad about their MOMS! how incredibly sweet of them. All *NSYNC ever sings about is love. Some highlights of this CD are: All of the songs are awesome! This is worth double what I paid!PEACE, y'all! :-)"
3,Can't keep up with their first album.,"too many slow songs. it has about 4 fast songs, which only 3 are good, and they have 2 good slow songs, if you like that kind of music. I want it that way and Show me the meaning are the two best songs, and then You probably might like Larger than life (which you've probably heard) and I don't want you back has a pretty good beat behind it. So the albums fast songs and Show me the Meaning kept this CD up to 3 stars. The Backstreet Boys should try to make a CD similar to their first one which has a great mix of slow, hip-hop, and dance songs."
1,"yeah, this band is original, unlike metallica...RIGHT?","Ok, i'm just gonna tell you facts about this album. They hardly wright any of their own music or lyrics, and still all their songs are about the same thing. I don't mean the same theme, thats different. But they all sound the same. A beat with chime like instruments and teenagers singing about girls like they are in love, in EVERY SONG. Sorry, but they just aren't original, and hardly even a band."
4,"I realy like this cd,but....","i really like this cd ,but if you like the dance music,there is not much on this cd. There is mostly slow dance songs and ballads. i guess it's okay,but not really high energy."
4,"My son likes this one, so...","...I couldn't help but give it 4 stars. He's your typical pre-teen, likes their music and was thrilled to get this for his birthday. I think he's come close to wearing it out!That's says it all for me!"
3,sophmore slump,"What can I say. I was dissapointed with the Backstreet Boys' second effort. The first album was a brilliant mix of great lyrics and beats, with the Boys' great voices to back it up. But most of the songs on Millenium are just mediocre. ""Larger Then Life"", ""I Want It That Way"", ""Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely"", ""It's Gotta Be You"", ""Don't Want You Back "", and ""The One"" were signs of recovery but they will have to do better on their next album to win back my respect. Buy their first album but pass on this one."
1,"Bad Boys, bad boys..stay back, boys!","I Don't even have enough space to give my run down of this CD, so I'll keep this short and direct. ""I Want It That Way"" is good but all in all, this CD is a total failure. For the other songs in the CD, here is my line for them: ""Tell me why, ain't nothing but BAD songs/Tell me why, ain't but a mistake/Tell me WHEN/I never wanna hear you SING/I want it THAT WAY"" Their first CD was better than this one. Tracks in here are so alike....No variation at all. Even I sing better! ;) Save your money and get the first one if you really must."
1,"Come on, they're whack.","All the songs on this CD sound the same, and whats more they sound the same as all the songs by Nsync, or 98* or LFO or youngstown or Hanson or New Kids or the Bee Gees. so if you already own records by any of those artists, then you already practicaly have this, and theres no reason to buy it. and if you dont own any of those, theres still no reason to buy it. or if you must listen to this junk, buy the bee gees instead, at least THEY were original when they sang this same stuff: 25 years ago."
1,I love this album!,"""Hello, I am a mindless 13-year-old girl who has allowed herself to become infatuated with boy bands who have no actual talent!""While you would never see a review like this written by the aforementioned, prototypical teenage girl author, the implicit statements underlying any author's favorable review of the Backstreet Boys are always what has been previously written. This is because the whole of any boy band's fans represent the most ignorant group in society--a group quite impressionable enough to, not just like, but embrace what is truly, as I have said about 'N SYNC's No Strings Attached, an execrable piece of pop music trash."
2,They can sing,"Whoop di-frickin'-do! I give five stars to the producers and the writers of all their songs. They really know how to manipulate millions of people into thinking that this stuff is actually good music. They could turn anyone into a teeny-bopper. Hope these guys enjoy their fame and fortune while it lasts. Then they'll look back and laugh at how easy it was to make millions off of candy-coated, processed, repetitive, aggravating, pain-inducing noise, which is something I could never allow myself to do to other people. Nevertheless, since 99% of the people who will read this review will disagree with me, I must say that the Boys are quite a dance-pop phenomenon and that they certainly have good voices, and thus I give them a very generous two stars."
1,Had Nothing That Interests Me!!!,"Last January, I bought Backstreet Boys ""Millennium"" for myself firsthand. The only thing I can say is that ""Millennium"" is an apt title to include an intro and maybe a few interludes just to make the album longer. ONLY two songs caught my interest: ""I Need You Tonight"", and ""Back to Your Heart"". Don't get me wrong, the Backstreet Boys are okay, ""Millennium"" would had to have done very well to sell 13 million copies! BUT THIS ALBUM JUST DIDN'T INTEREST ME!!!!"
3,"No offense, some nice songs.","Now, I'm 17 but not into this whole ""boy band"" thing. Boy bands were kicked out of the Grammy Awards after that 1991 scandal I just read about, but these guys garnered 7 with this one.This isn't the best CD in the world, but the best songs on here, this diamond certified release, are ""Larger Than Life,"" ""I Want It That Way,"" ""Show Me The Meaning of Being Lonely"" (it's the best on the CD!), and ""The Perfect Fan."" Otherwise, I've heard better than this."
3,good but overhyped,"I will admit, I am a fan of ""boy-band"" type musical groups, and that includes BSB. Backstreet's original, debut cd is still one of my favorites, but i have to admit i was dissappointed with Millenium. Part of the greatest appeal of the first cd (catchy songs with varying tempo) was lost in millenium. The debut focused mainly on finding love, and millenium seems to focus more on loosing love. Songs like ""show me the meaning of being lonely"" give the album a tone too serious for their targeted audience. Millenium is still a quality cd, but not what i expected from pop icons like the Backstreet Boys."
2,Millenium,The Back Street Boys are almost as cool as the meaty cheesy boys. I think their pickleicious except for all they're pimples.
2,"um, no.","If you're looking for whiny, unimaginative ballads and dull, overmixed uptempos, this is the cd for you! After waiting years for BSB's sophmore US album, getting handed... THIS was purely insulting. I'm not sure what The Boys were trying to prove with this cd, but they did a BAD job.A word of advice: Stick to what you're best at. Being a boy band."
1,Terminal!,"This band has hit ""rock bottom"" in being the worst bubblegum pop band out there! Of course, like New Kids on the Block, they'll be gone in no time. Under all that plastic surgery, piercings, and expensive clothing is actually 5 greasy guys who are cashing in big time on teeny bopper's allowance money. It shouldn't be long until Hanson teaches them how to flip burgers at McDonalds.So where's the musical talent, Rod Stewart? There is none. These guys don't write their own songs or play any instruments. What you have here is elevator music (VERY bad elevator music) with 5 high school dropouts singing to it in a chorus type of way. What earns the benjamins? Their outfits and physical appearance. There is ""NO."" musical demeanor in sight.If you're not going to listen to what I say, buy their CD. Rest assured you'll just be buying a very expensive blank compact disc."
2,It's ok.... for a boyband,"Let me start off by saying the Backstreet Boys are alright musicians. 2/3 of them can sing, whereas the rest sound like screechng cats. However, in my opinion Millenium has too many slow songs, for my liking. Precisely 8 out of 12. More than half. "" Show me the meaning of being Lonely"" is too depressing, Larger than Life was the best song on the album, until it got played out by MTV. My favorite songs are ""Gotta be You"" and for a slow song, "" No One Else Comes Close"". But, millions of prepubescent girls probaly disagree with me, and thats fine. I'll just keep listening to their first album instead, and pull out Millenium when I need a reminder of how innocent they seem to be, and why millions of underage girls go gaga at the very sight of them. After all, I was there, and it aint pretty. And, when I'm in a bad mood, and need a good laugh, all I have to do is think of Nick's prepubescent voice singing ""I'm your bad boy""."
3,Pretty Good,"Well, if you are looking for happy, bubble gum, pop music then this cd is not for you. All these songs are about are that they miss the girl they love or they can't get her. The songs are mostly sad. But it is an ok cd."
5,This CD rocks!!,"You have to buy this CD. The first time I listened to it, song after song, I went nuts! Every single song is great, and it's no wonder their tour sold out either. The great things about the Backstreet Boys are that they are ALL hot, actually can sing, unlike some bands, and have great music! Once again, I strongly urge you to buy this CD!!!"
1,The CD is sad.,"The content of this CD is is very disappointing compared to the brilliance of the Backstreet Boys'last one. There are way too many solos by Nick Carter, who can't sing, and most of the songs focus on themselves. ""Larger Than Life"" is a perfect example. Can you get any more conceited?"
3,I need you & Back to your heart are the best songs!,"It took them long enough to make it. But it is worth it!Back to your heart is probably my favourite, not just because it's the only song they have written on the album. Overall the Album is cracking and i can't wait until they bring out the next!!!!!!!! Love Kev XXXXX"
4,Very good music with lots of positive lyrics,"I am a 40-year old male. As I purchased this CD, the young lady at the bookshop made a remark that this music is for 'kids', that I should be listening to Sarah McLaughlin. Age aside, this is good music, good melody with positive motivational lyrics. The last song on the album is quite touching. The artist wrote this tune with lots of depth atypical of a 20 something. Lots of respect to them!"
4,I'm impressed.,"I just got it today, and have listened to only eight of the songs. I am impressed already! I really like Larger than Life, and I Want it That Way! It is a great CD!"
4,ALL RIGHT!,"the best boy band on EARTH returns with a new album!!.good music, thoughtful lyrics and hot beats.THUMBS-UP!"
2,it's all been done before,"Even though the BSB's singing has improved hugely on this album, it's the same old stuff. I'm really tired of hearing endless mushy ballads about love. Is that all they can write about is relationships? there's more to life than that. I think the BSB have huge potential to be something good, but they obviously aren't showing it. I would normally give 1 star, but since they sound better on this album I'll give them 2. Oh and to the person who said that anyone who gives this 1 star is jealous or afraid they will like it, it's not a case of either. Some people just don't like the backstreet boys at all(i myself don't really like them that much). Shocking, isn't it?"
2,Decent single,"Now, I'm a 15 year old guy and I'll admit that the song ""I want it that way"" is one hell of a catchy tune. The Backstreet Boys were also the first boy band I heard before all the other crappy immitation boy bands started dominating the radio. While I don't reall like the BSB I'm willing to give them some credit."
4,An album even a MOM could love!,"This album has become an instant in our house--my 19 yr old daughter bought it for my 15 yr old daughter at 12:01am for her birthday. We each have our favorite songs--mine is ""The One"". Each song is unique, yet they all contain the BSB sound that we've all come to know and love. Because there's variety in the songs, it appeals to all age groups. The Perfect Fan really tugs at my heartstrings but the sound of The One is the song that I can't get enough of...good thing stereos have 'repeat'. I really think this CD lives up to all the hype...and buying it is money well spent."
5,Absolutely the BEST!!!!!,"I think that the best song on your new CD is "" I want it that way."" I want you to know that I am one of the BSB's number 1 fans!!I really wish that they would come to Fort Wayne, Indiana so that I could meet them!!That would be the greatest event of my life!!!!!"
5,it's stellar,"I love ""Don't Want You Back"" that most definately is different from any of the Boys songs. If I wasn't so sleepy, I would write a 1000-word-summary of why I love this album. It just needs more uptempos that have made them so famous. Much love to them."
1,Talent,"The Backstreet Boys rule! They have so much to say. I heard they write their own songs and play all of the instruments, too!"
1,Someone who enjoys real music.,"The BBB know very little about music. To have some guy mix a few percussion beats in a studio and then have a writer put together a few redundant, genotypical lyrics is not what I call creative and beautiful music. Where has the music that stirs the soul with a syphony's violin, or a bluegrass banjo, or a guitar burning from the speed of the solo, or even a soothing church's organ? Where has all the music gone?"
2,it's okay,"I think the songs sound a lot like their first album...and I don't like the first album. Some of the songs have similiar melodies and the words of 'larger than life' doesn't really make sense. Truthfully, I'm not a backstreet boys fan, but they do have some talent, I'll give them that much."
4,Great,"It's a great cd.I love almost all the songs.if you like fun ,fast,or slow songs this is the cd for you"
1,One of the worst CDS.,"This is one of the worst American C.D.s Ever. With whiney, plagerized lyrics. The songs all sound the same, none of the boys can sing, basicly one of the worst groups to come out of the U.S.A. With all these boy bands sounding so much alike, they should sue themselves for plagerism!"
5,Breakthrough Recording Techniques,"This was an excellent CD. It had amazing sound quality and breakthrough recording techniques. A great depth to the lyrics, especially in the songs The Perfect Fan and Back to Your Heart, written by members of the group, was evident. This is the best CD I have ever heard, and I reccomend it to everyone. No wonder it won Mtvs Best Album of All Time."
1,a bunch of cheesy songs,i dont reccomend this cd the songs all sound the same and after listening to it for a while they dont even sound good so unless u like bad songs and chessy songs with no heart put into them then buy the cd if u like good music buy something else if your really desperate for a different cd no offense to bsb becuase im a very big fan but i think N Sync's cd is even better than this cd
4,Sophmore effort deserves A-plus,"As a twenty-four year old graduate student in music, I endure constant teasing concerning my musical love affair with the Backstreet Boys. However, having attained a degree in voice, I feel just a little qualified to comment on the Boys' performance on their second album. While not always achieving the very best of vocal production, (open your mouth, Brian!) all of the Boys' show obvious improvement. I think that what intrigues me most about Backstreet is the fact that five great solo voices can blend to form a distinctive ensemble sound. Paramount to this sound is Nick's unusual timbre, A.J.'s agility, Brian's lyrical strength, Howie's warm falsetto, and Kevin's maturity. Kudos also to the involvement each of the guys brought to the album, from writing to producing and arranging. This album definitly earns praise in the hopefully ever-evolving process of music, and is a positive step in the right direction for this group."
5,They can resume all of your feelings!!!!!!!!!,"I think that what they do for us (their fans) it's awesome, because they give us a way to expres what we feel and, thas why we ¡love! Backstreet boys, you know they are the best and they always will be........."
1,to bad I couldnt give it 0 stars,"This is the worst cd ever made. The guys arent even musicians. 1.They dont write there own music. 2. Just because there ""hot"" people like them. 3. None of them play an instrumentDo not waste your money on this cd It is the worst ever made and if you wanna by a real cd at least by one that takes work to make"
5,Aa awesome album!,This Cd is great. It has some peppy songs like always then some beautiful slower songs. All in all this Cd is a great one for BSB.
3,Well...,"It's okay, I guess. But you think with their debut album, Backstreet would have more up-beat songs on their second. The begining of the album is great, a really good variety. But tracks 5-12, with the exception of #6, are all sappy, mellow ballads. You can't tell them apart, but they're good, sort of."
1,"Make the music stop.FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,MAKE THE MUSIC STOP!","This CD is tied with N sync as the worst CD ever. They write what? 2 of them write some of like 3 songs, come on! These guys are totally manufactured, not to mention they are here simply to torment us with single after single! All the boy bands are the same, these guys are just particulary annoying. Highlights of this CD include: the end! P.S. Why can't I give this 0 stars? P.P.S. Check out some real bands like Korn, Zombie, Sepultura, Soulfly, Obbituary or Incubus and save your soul!"
1,I'd like to settle the BSB / N SYNC argument right now...,"They both suck! So do 98 degrees and every other ""boy band"". They don't write the music, they don't play the music, they just belt it out and bounce around the stage. This garbage is an assault on young America. The record execs think they can sugar coat thoughtless blather and wrap it in a tight shirt and YOU the buying public will eat it up. Send a message to the corporate suites behind this crap, tell them to actually LOOK for talented teen musicians (THEY EXIST) and stop feeding us this junk food for our ears. BSB are like cotton candy, big and bright, but once it's consumed it dissolves instantly into sticky pink goo."
1,My vote is for N SYNC anyday!,"I have to admit that they had one good song, ""I Want it That Way."" But, even that got old. My sister got this CD for Christmas. She listens to it 24-7. It drives me crazy. All their songs have no potential. I can't believe they're actually as popular as they are. I'm disgusted! YUCK!"
5,I Happen to be a 12-year-old girl and...,"I like this CD. No, I happen to think BSB are the ugliest ogres ever to walk the planet. I bought this CD for one reason, and one reason onle. THEY CAN SING. People are saying that 12 year olds buy this only for the looks...well, they are wrong. FYI this is the only ""bubblegum"" CD I own. Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Limp Bizkit are more my style. Oh and those who are saying *NSync is the ""best babes to walk the earth"" puh-leeze...Listen to ""IT'S GOTTA BE YOU"" and ""IT'S GONNA BE ME""...YOU decide, even the titles sound the same. *NSync would NEVER compromise their ""coolness"" (ha! being a marionette and an action figure make you ""cool"") to write a song about their love for their mother or their FANS....get your dictionary and look up MUSIC...and it will say Millenium."
5,The Best CD Ever,"This Cd is the best I loved it all the song are so good my favorite is number 2 on the cd ""I Want It That Why this is the best song ever and bsb is the best boy group there is so I would allways tell some who wants to get a cd to get the bsb cd sny of them so. Go bsb and this is the best or one of the bsb's ever!"
5,The CD is larger than life!,"Awesome CD. BSB is a great band of five hot guys and they are MUCH better than N'Sync. You'll LOVE all of the songs on this album. At first I wasn't really into the whole ""Boy Band "" thing but the Backstreet Boys changed all of that. The CD has a great variety of soft ( I need you tonight, Spanish Eyes) and jazzy songs (Larger than life, Its gotta be you). You will love the CD. It truly is Larger than Life!"
1,How to make yourself hate music...,"Step 1. Buy this album. Step 2. Listen to this album. Step 3. Go sit in an elevator for 4 hours. (You'll probably like the Muzak more.) Step 4. No need to repeat, if you have children, most likely, this CD will be played once a day at loud tones anyway.Seriously, if this is your idea of music, go take music lessons. Learn how to play an instrument, or even sing. After about a month of singing lessons, you'd be up to the same level of tone as these 5 twits.Parents - if you child (or children) asked for this album, buy them a Nat King Cole album instead, or purchase some music lessons for them.I can easily believe these people write their own music - it's all horrible. I've heard better music coming out of flushing toilets."
1,'Packaged' is the right word for this tripe,"For an instance of how history repeats itself in miniature, look at the current 'phenoms,' namely, the BS Boys, N'Sync, and 98 degrees, plus BS herself. Not a one of them has any talent, but all possess a lot of good looks; not a one can sing, but all of them can use the studio to negate their flaws. Luckily, like the New Kids on the Block, Tiffany, and all the rest, soon they will be a fading memory...and so will their trite and shallow declarations of 'love' and their incredibly insipid music videos."
1,boo,I dont understand how people can like this....this is for preps and people like them who dont have their own personality they just all dress the same and walka round like robots. The backstreet boys are artifical they are liked for their looks not for their musical talents which they have none. Once they pick up an instrament i will respect them more...oh and yes i've seen one of them play guitar...but he wasn't really doing anything...plucking one string...while the guy next to him played the whole song.
1,NO TALENT!,"The Backstreet Boys are a perfect example of how music should not be. Their lyrics are stupid and they don't even write their own songs. It should be a requirement for all bands that they write their own stuff. They can't sing and all their stuff sounds the same. I will admit that their hits are kind of catchy but there's no substance to the songs so after about 2 listens you want to shoot the speakers the ""music"" is coming from. The only appeal they have is to 12 year old girls who think they're cute. It's just the same as Britney Spears. I think she's really hot, but just like the Backstreet Boys, she has no talent. I would recommend this CD only to those who enjoy torchure in the form of music, or maybe to drive other siblings nuts by playing it while you have ear plugs in. Otherwise go look for a band who has actually written their own stuff."
1,They Call This Music?,"How can they call this music? To me, boy bands respresent the crux of the problem with today's society. Everything is done for everyone. Here are five guys with no musical talent (until the producers fix things) who had their group created for them. They can't play their own music, and they can't sing either. The only reason these affronts to music are allowed on stage is because they can dance and they look good. What ever happened to the original bands? The ones who never sold out and played music for the joy of playing and not for the money? What happened to bands like Led Zeppelin and Simon and Garfunkel? No boy band deserves respect until they write their own material and play their own instruments. As a guitar player/songwriter, I know the difference that comes from writing your own music. You can feel the music. These guys only feel the money."
4,BSB: They're Here To Stay,"Ah, The Backstreet Boys, the main boy band in the center of all the controversy, the object of millions of girls minds. Their second album attempt, ""MIllenium"" was a sell out on the opening day, mostly because of devoted fans, what they wouldnt do to get that CD. The Backstreet Boys sophmore album is a vast improvement from their self-titled debut album. The music is written better, and the lyrics depart from their traditional Lovey dovey style of music,with songs like Larger Than Life. Overall the Backstreet Boys sophmore album is a great improvement with great music and great lyrics."
2,I just don't get it,Why are people so obbsesed with this band. I will admit that I want it that way is a really good song. That is why i picked this up. This cd is really a generic album the perfect fan..what a joke you would think these boy bands could write ALL of thier songs. Does anyone have any taste in music? I feel bad that i bought into the system and bought this. can any of you think for yourself. Stop buying into trl unless your 12 then i guess it is kind of hard to go against the grain. When you don't know the diffrence
2,Not a very good effort,"Okay I know I've already written a review but I am bored so I'll write another. What is so special about BSB? Their songs all have the same beat and their lyrics are so simple and boring that you can't stand it! But I gotta give them credit for writing a few of their songs, and 3 of the 5 have decent voices. If you are sick of all this peppy pop music, but dont want something really depressing like Korn, get the new Red Hot Chili Peppers CD ""Californication"" I just got it and its really good. Bye Luv ya!"
1,This cd is the worst,"I'm warning anyone who is thinking about ordering this album, it's horrible. The guys can colaborate their voices worth anything. There are about only 3 songs on the whole cd worth attemting to listen to. They just can't sing together worth a dime. I think you should go order *NSYNC's No Strings Attached. It is the best cd I've listened to in a long time. It has slow songs,party songs, and even songs about the future! I think you would be better off buying a Nsync cd then anything because the can actually sing together and very well on top of that!"
2,I'll give them credit for trying,"This CD isn't as great as people think it is. Every song is totally dense pop and they all sound the same. I guess you may like it if you are a true pop fan unlike myself who like *N Sync more becuase they are more R&B. And this man Rickey Wright well he's just Wrong. I dont think he understands the meaning of ""Good Song"". Although at one point in my life, I had respect for these people but it was all lost once I heard what they were saying about *N Sync. Just becuase *N Sync broke every record set by them doesnt mean they have to get all childish and say harsh things towards them. It just shows that the Backstreet Boys have poor spartsmanship and will not be around for very longer. They've had they're run and its time for them to say byebyebye to the music business."
2,I agree!,"I was reading reviews and I noticed David J DeCastris is right. It is sad that the BSB don't write their songs or play the instraments! I do still like their 1st album but I think this one STINKS, I do like Larger Than Life and I Want It That A Way! thanks for reading!"
2,SHOW ME THE MEANING OF BEING BORED TO DEATH.,"Backstreet Boys are a boy band. But that is NOT why I don't like them...I like N Sync. Why?Backstreet Boys lack edge in their music. Their dance songs are middle of the road...such as ""Larger Than Life"", playing it safe.On the otherhand the album is filled with sappy ballads for those teen girls thinking that their fave Boy is singing to only them.""I Want It That Way"", and ""Show the Meaning of Being Lonely"" to name a couple are from the same ballad cookie cutter mold, which I am sick of!Their latest single from this CD ""The One"" is so run of the mill pop, and it shows, peaking at No. 30 on the Hot 100 Billboard chart, radio is maybe finally taking notice, that it isn't the artist that makes the song it is the song that makes the artist....Bye Bye Bye."
2,"Backstreet Boys ""Millenium"" is ""eh""","I got this CD on May 18, 1999 (the day it came out). I told myself I liked it and sure, some songs were good (""Larger Than Life"" ""Show Me the Meaning"" and a few others) but most of them sounded a little too alike. There are albums that you get and think, ""wow! This has variety!"" such as *N Sync. Now THERE'S a great boy band. I started to dislike BSB because not only are they bitter but I have to close my ears when I hear them sing live. Sure, there are some good songs on this album, but it ruins it when you hear them live and try to go back to the album with a positive attitude."
5,"This is an excelent CD, all of the tracks are truly awesome!","This CD is some great work done by our good friends the Backstreet Boys. If you liked their first Cd, you'll love this one. Amazon.com's price makes it even better. This CD has great songs sung by great guys! Brian Littrel, Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, Howie Dourough, and AJ Mclean are a super blend of voices and if you like harmony, this CD is for you!"
5,the excellent CD,"this CD is really adorable, i mean i never thought that backstreet boys would come up with something wonderful like that.i liked the song 'don't want you back' it's more than good, the sounds in it are very impressive and the way in which it was sung. also 'don't wanna lose you now'the whole album is really nice, it's one of my favorites."
5,the best cd ever!!!!!,This is the best cd that i have ever gotten. Backstreet Boys are the best and most talented guys. I love them lots and please buy the cd. buy it and see if you love it as much as i do.KTBSPA!!!!!
2,Disappointing,"I have to say that compared to their first CD this CD was plain miserable. I was listening to the radio the other day and their song ""I want it that way"" came on. And personally I liked the song. But then at the end the replayed this clip of the guys doing acappella of that song. It sucked. I just realized without the music to cover them the Backstreet boys can't sing acappella to save their lives. For all fans.... See behind their masks and realize they suck!!!!! I have."
5,"The best album I've heard in a very, very long time!!!!","Five stars!! Brovo! Millennium by the Backstreet Boys has got to be the BEST album I've heard in a very, very long time. I thought it was very well put together. I also liked that they wrote on some of their songs. The lryics are very meaningful to the song's ""personality"" if you will. I also think that the last song was very sweet on the group's part. And I think their deticating the first song to their fans is a great way to say thank you to them(the fans)."
4,Millenium: not just the begeinning of a century,this album is great. if you like the backstreet boys even a tiny bit you'll luv it. it is filled w/ great music.im tellin' u- you've got to get it.
5,Backstreet Boys Do It Again !,"Oh here we go again ..... The first Backstreet Boy CD was phenomenal the second was even better. There sweet voices and lyrics took me away ...... This is a must have for all Backstreet fans (or fans of any good music for that matter). This CD shows how they have grown up as performers and people and I am not only astonished and amazed, I'm proud. I love this CD and listin 2 it Every day ! There isn't one song I don't like on this CD ....... I love them all. If you want to listin 2 great songs with great beats, lyrics and singers then BUY THIS CD ! I recomend it to any music lover."
1,Not even worth 1 star,"BSB suck. Everything they say is cheesey to get the girls. All the songs sound exactly the same. It is terrible, dont' buy it. Anyone 5 guys can dance and sing some stupid lovey-dovy song. Can we say, ""New Kids On The Block part 2?"""
4,Another perspective,"I believe that this CD was bought for my eight-year old brother on its first day, although my mother absolutely loved the song ""I Want It That Way"". Anyway, I want to set the fact straight that this CD is not mine; I am a 12-year old guy. This CD always seems to remain in the CD player, and there are some legitimately good songs on it such as ""The One"". The others don't suck; they are simply melancholic. Such is the monotony that while I certainly don't have the entire CD memorized, it all comes back to me when it plays. It's not a bad CD; certainly better than 'N Stink. I would recommend it."
5,The Best and Most Meaningful Album in the World,"This CD is the best the boys have done. I have all their cd's: Backstreet Boys (canadian), Backstreet's Back (canadian), Backstreet Boys (U.S.), and of course Millenium. All the songs have a great meaning to them unlike some other ones they did in the past. Even ""10,000 Promises"", ""Like A Child"", or even ""That's What She Said"" couldn't compare to the best song in the world: ""Show Me the Meaning Of Being Lonely."" This is a sad song, but it is great. It is the best song bsb has ever done, and that's hard to come out of my mouth because I've liked ""10,000 Promises"" for a long time. This CD rocks, and for what dumb reason anybody doesn't have this cd, it's a MUST HAVE!! I love each and every one of the guys and I know that they are better than any ""boy band"" out there, trust me on this, they RULE! KTBSPA!! AJ, Kev, B-Rok, Nick, and Howie D Forever!!! Luv, Alyssa"
5,Totally Awesome!!!!!,"This cd totally rulez!!! I love it all. I guess the lest fav would be Spanish Eyes but that's still cool. I love tracks 1,2,5, and I think it's 9..so that would be Larger Than Life, I Want It That Way, I Need You Tonight, Back To Your Heart. Those would have to be my fav. And I Love how in track 6 they said ""Backstreet's back, alright!"" That was cool. Oh and I love Brian's tribute to his mom on ""The Perfect Fan"" That's so sweet. Well, I think that's all.~Robin ~JAyBIRD~LUCKY 13 --- Chris and Joey of *N SYNC, rule!! A.J. and Brian of BSB rule!! ---"
5,A nice suprise!!,I didn't want my review to be like everyone elses but the majority of them are so very right. This is an extraordinary piece of work from the Backstreet Boys. It is absolutely amazing.
4,Great CD!,"I really like this CD! I'm not really a Backstreet fan, and i thought their first cd was the stupidest cd in the world, but i like this one. It has a different sound from the first one, so if ya hated it I would still recommed getting Millenium. For those of you who liked the first cd, deffenitly(sp?)check this one out. BSB's voices have matured alot since they started, and for the better!"
3,"""Millenium"" plays by the numbers","In the Backstreet Boys' slick pop follow-up to their better US debut, poor, soft love ballads and dance numbers abound as the Boys play it safe and by the numbers. From a stylistic standpoint, ""Millenium"" is nothing special. The vocalists range from a country crooner (Brian Littrel) to a Latino pop singer (Howard Dorough), which, needless to say, makes for bizarre harmonies. The Backstreet Boys produce standard mainstream fare to entertain the masses and this is their utterly drab product."
4,"Nice, pretty music from a pretty-boy band.","Pop music nowadays can easily be divided between three groups: angry rock singers, angry rap singers, and formulaic pretty boy/girl bands. Backstreet Boys, needless to say, falls in the third category along with 'N Sync and 98 Degrees. Music that is somewhat cheesy tho' catchy and occasionally contradictory is a sure winner for the less belligerent (majority) bunch of teen agers that go for rap or rock. So Backstreet Boys and others write songs according to the formula. Who cares? That's what they do and they do it well. I generally reject R&B or whatever BSB are in favour of Alternative or Metal, but I have to admit that they're not bad. When my friends played ""I Want It That Way"", I was singing along by the end."
3,"OK, but a little cheesy...","You'll love this if you're into the ballads Perry sang with Dead Can Dance, especially latter-era stuff like ""Don't Fade Away."" I think this is all pretty trite, lame stuff, but I also feel that way about Gerrard's solo work, and more and more (and this would have been heresy to my high school-era self), Dead Can Dance itself.Sonically, this is like songs Scott Walker might have composed and performed after eating mushrooms and talking a long, solitary walk in the moors."
1,How far Brendan Perry has fallen,"I got this CD right when it was released. The cover indicated that maybe the spirit of Dead Can Dance had not completely died. How wrong I was. After listening to this, I realized that the real soul of Dead Can Dance was Lisa. You can still hear it in her music. Brendan seems to want to be a folk singer now. I suppose being in arguably the greatest musical group of the late 20th century just burned him out."
4,DCD lives on with Perry's fine new CD!,"'The guy from Dead Can Dance' makes an entrancing solo debut with ""Eye of the Hunter"". A rather moody and contemplative record, recorded with the pristine clarity we've come to expect from DCD records, listeners will not find this to be much of a departure from Perry's tracks on Dead Can Dance records. The difference is a more acoustic and unclutterd approach -- the world-music percussion of DCD's last record is gone, but Perry's trademark dramatic synths and gentle guitar picking remain. Standout tracks are the opening ""Saturday's Child"" and the closer ""Archangel"" .. both of which feature some surprising new vocal stylings. This is fine and beautiful music -- a perfect rainy Sunday record!"
4,"A grower, but still good stuff","A lot of people seem put off by this record. No surprise. You can certainly hear a lot more of the trademark Dead Can Dance sound in Lisa Gerrard's solo work than on ""The Eye of the Hunter."" I've got to say, though, that after many listens, I tend to throw this CD in my player almost as often as DCD's ""Within the Realm of a Dying Sun"" or Lisa's ""The Mirror Pool.""No, it's not orchestral, tribal, or otherworldly, but that is its beauty. It is raw and emotional, and very, very human. If you are looking for inspiration, toss in ""The Serpent's Egg,"" but if you want company while you're going through a melancholy period, then this album is your best friend."
4,"Wished it were ""Dead""","I've been eagerly awaiting this album primarily because I am a DCD fan trying to cope with the fact of the band's demise. I've always preferred Perry's contribution to DCD over Gerrard's, and so my expectations of this album were high. While ""Eye"" is a decent album in its own right, it is characteristically ""un-Dead"". The album lacks any residue of the mystical qualities we fans found and loved in DCD's ""Spleen"" and the likes. I cannot help but sense that the theme of this album is something like ""Brendan finds love (in all its aspects)"". Musical styles change, of course. For better or worse, we've seen him drifting into this ever since DCD's ""Labyrinth"". Who knows where this will lead. ""Eye"" is a keeper, though, certainly better than Perry's last non-DCD effort (""Elijah's Mantle""). But, it's still not Dead."
3,What a disapointment,"I have to admit, anything he would have done would be a letdown after the brilliance of his contributions to Dead Can Dance, but this cd is a real downer. I have always been a huge fan of his voice, and he does not disapoint there, but these songs lack something. Where is the exotic rythms that he displayed on Toward the Within, or Spiritchaser? I realize this is a new beginning for Brendan,but this cd puts me to sleep. Hopefully he will come out of his coma in future releases. Sorry fans(which im one of the biggest), but this only deserves 3 stars.... barely!!!"
2,This one made me cringe,"I can forgive the somewhat cheesy lyrics, and I did find the musical accompaniment to be very good here. What is unforgiveable is Brendan's voice. It's just plain bad! From the first track on, I almost felt embarrassed for him for releasing such deplorable crooning. And what's worse, Brendan produced this mess himself! Not to be entirely negative (I did say the music was good), there is one track on which Brendan's voice sounds like his old self and which is wonderfully arranged - Medusa. Great song. Sadly, one great track does not compensate for cash spent. DCD fans, take heed. Keep the taps flowing and be well."
5,Curious question?,"Does anyone else think Brendan Perry sounds like Frank Sinatra? Since a friend told me this I cannot get the image out of my head of Brenden at an antique microphone with a fedora hat on! Ok, so he is a goth Frank Sinatra...ooh, I have no idea if that is a good phrase for it...Anyhow, the CD is good, buy it or be cast into a firey pit, your choice!"
4,"Not DCD, possibly the ghost of Tim Buckley","It's sorta sad but understandable that 90% of the Amazon reviews center on how much this album is not like Dead Can Dance. Admittedly the work Perry did within the DCD framework was incredible and I'm sympathetic to wanting more (at least we got a few new ones from their tour awhile back). But no, EYE OF THE HUNTER is not in the vein of DCD, although it's very recognizably Perry. It continues his homage to the style of many of Tim Buckley's ballads (including an outright cover of I MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND). They're gloomed up a bit more than Buckley usually did, but have the same dreamy atmosphere. Taken on it's own terms EYE OF THE HUNTER is good, not great. Knowing what he's capable of it feels a bit lazy (especially since it's all he's released since DCD's SPIRITCHASER). However, it's still very worthwhile and worth exploring."
1,Poor direct to video sequel is a waste of time,"Mommy was an Ok story, it tried to be classy but failed because of sluggish pace and lack of action. But this very cheap sequel is just terrible. The cast is awful, cheap gore has been added this time around, and the story is stupid. Please, no Mommy 3 (unless they shoot it in 3-D!) Well, maybe not even then....."
1,I Can't Believe I Watched The Whole Film,"I watched this movie because Patty McCormack was in it. However, I wish I hadn't. I really wonder what made Patty want to make a movie that had a terrible plot, and even worse dialogue. A good actress like Patty couldn't save this stinker. Save your money and time!"
1,Painful to watch,Here is more proof that writers shouldn't make movies - remember Stephen King and Maximum overdrive. Well Mommy 2 wouldn't even excite Ed Wood if he was alive. Really poor plot with even worse acting. Painful to watch
4,Almost as good as the first!,"I think some of the reviewers on this page were too harsh on this film. Sure, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but let's not be unkind. Max Allan Collins clearly tried to make a decent sequel to his first film, the smart and wickedly entertaining MOMMY, and I think, for the most part, he succeeds. Patty McCormack effectively reprises the role she played in the earlier film, the ever-devoted MOMMY who is trying to win back the love and respect of her adorable young daughter. However, further killings ensue, and it seems that dear, loving mother is up to her same old tricks. Or is she? Sequels are seldom as good as their predacessors, but I think MOMMY 2 comes very close and at any rate, it's just a fun and entertaining thriller. Despite a few added gore effects, MOMMY 2 still concentrates more on plot and character rather than supplying cheap thrills, and that's the best way to do it!"
5,A Wonderful Book!,"This book mixes some of my favorite elements of a story; a historical setting and an interesting plot. Impossible to put down, this book tells the well-known story of the Trapp family (featured in the Sound of Music). From Maria leaving the convent to escaping from Austria, you won't be able to get the plot out of your head. I definitely think you're missing something if you don't read it!"
1,Had To Return This Watch,"This pocket watch looks cheap and is made the same way. I couldn't get the cover to open without a struggle so had to return it. I only wanted something that would keep time accurately, and perhaps it would have, but I need a watch I can look at easily. There was no problem with the return and credit so I'm thankful for that."
5,Shirley and her Christmans Gifts Review #2,"Good watch, but really designed as a pocket watch. I had to buy a ring for the neck chain so that it would hang on my chest properly. It is lovely and I can read the time even without my glasses! I love it."
1,Didn't work for me,"I took this product as directed. I got a little bit of a buzz from the morning does but nothing from the afternoon dose. It didn't suppress my appetite. In fact, I think I was a bit hungrier. I do kick boxing 3-4 days a week and stick to a 1500 calorie a day diet. I took this to accelerate the weightloss. I actually gained weight! This product did not work for me."
5,Good Vitamins,I usually buy these at the drug store or grocery store. saw them here and decided to buy the larger size. They came packaged well and were delivered before expected
1,Not the actual item display,"I receive the shipment and what happend was it's two bottle of Centrum Silver 110 count Bottle pack in a plastic container with a barcode sticker label Centrum Silver, 220 Count Bottle New. It's different from the image and description stated that it's a bottle of 220 count. Also the Expiration date of the two bottle was even cover by another barcode sticker with the same discription of 220-count bottle. When I try to remove the sticker just for me to check the expiration date, it seems that the expiration tag was already been removed and just cover by this sticker. I have no way to know the expiration of this prodcut now and I suspect that it might be close to expired."
2,The picture of the item is lying.,"I brought 8 bottles of the centrum silver,220 for adult 50+. But when I received it, I found that it is not the same one as the picture shows. The picture is lying to me. What I received is not the latest product but the previous product, and the expiry left only one year. So be careful, don't make mistake like me."
1,lycopene promised in picture but no where on product,"it's just regular Centrum silver, no lycopene in formula, not anywhere. I wonder if this is just my luck or deceptive marketing. Grrrr."
1,"NOT AS ADVERTIZED, POSSIBLY EXPIRED","Ordered the 220 count bottles. Got 2x 110 count bottles instead. Not as advertized. Additionally, it appears that the expiration date has been altered, and a sticker added on top of it. That may be dangerous and criminal. I am returning."
1,pains,"Not a good product, cause stomach pains? pharmaceutical companies and Wall Street makes no difference, just think of money"
2,Centrum Multivitamin,"The Centrum Silver Multivitamin for 50+ did not dissolve as I expected and caused stomach cramps and pains. Will not re-order these multivitamins again. Try ""Nature's Alive"" for men 50+ better nutrionional value from a perspective of vitamins and minerals, not to mention lots of fruits annd vegetables included."
3,15 months away from expired date,"I do not know how ""fresh"" of inventory should be reasonable for you, but this kind of not satisfied me.I bought this for relatives as gifts, but kind of shamed about the expired date.I bought some other supplyment from walmart.com, and the expired date is more than 2 years away."
4,Good,"Very good product, cheaper than in supermarket and very nice gift for the parents.Command for the person who needs."
5,good for my parents,My parents is 50+ and need more vietamins . So I bought Centrum .I hope they will be more healthy and long live.
3,Typical mix of songs for this kinetic postpunk trio,"This contains an alternate version of one of their catchiest songs, ""Ice Queen,"" a bonus track that's a bit of punk exuberance, two more instrumentally oriented songs-- track 3's really annoying with its queasy synth, and track 4 with its vocal decoder warblings, and a couple of relatively straightforward songs in their own style that recalls Wire, Mission of Burma, and Volcano Suns. Fans will like some of this at least, but beginners should start with their albums themselves."
2,Excellent Customer Service,"This cream didn't work for me. It is very creamy, and felt nice, but dried out my skin. Returned for a full refund. I would try other products."
4,Good for dental student,"I used this text to review OMFS prior to starting my residency and found it helpful to prepare for rounds. As I progressed in my training I found myself using this text less and less, its just not detailed enough compared to some of the multi-volume OMFS books. Overall, good for dental students prior to residency or early on for a quick overview but not detailed enough to be a go-to text or a board review text."
2,"Just OK, some quality issues...","At first I thought these were a decent product at a good price. I understand that they are not OEM but it is really about quality. The large rubber ""studs"" used to attach the product to the vehicle loosened after a few months. They did not come out, but loosened enough to cause the headlight to bounce around on bumps. I have taken both left and right out twice now to modify these rubber attachment points. I managed to tighten them up, but with a slight design change, these would be much better... You get what you pay for, but in this instance these were not cheap...I did like the fact they came with bulbs already installed."
5,Breathtaking!,This is nothing less than modern Dickens. A kind of Great Expectations for our post-modern times. It's amazing. It'sa whole different level of writing. All I can say is -- readit and see what I mean!
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Moorcock here has written a book about late twentieth century London. It also a of a commentary on the political and media power structures of the time, as a rocker type guy seems to have uncovered evidence that a ridiculously wealthy industrialist named Begg is actually alive, and still plotting.This leads to wanderings around the world to try and do something about it."
2,Not universal fit,"This tray is designed to fit Eldon keyboard trays 61003, 61103, 06103, 06203, 06343. It is not universal and will not fit on a keyboard tray with a central support. The keyboard tray bottom has to be perfectly flat to attach the mouse tray. The description does not make this clear at all."
3,just ok hair remover,This worked on thinner hair but not well on thicker hair. The blades wore fast.
3,Decent for the price,"Didn't trim hair as much as I would have liked. I have yet to figure out how the trimmer piece can fit and work. The head doesn't pivot as much as I thought it would. Overall, I like it. I wouldn't plan on using it to trim eyebrows since the trimmer head didn't work for me. Still have to shave, but it's a good alternative when you don't have time to shave."
1,Buyer beware.!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Please use care if you attempt to use this product on any sensitive area of your body (face, neck, ect.) It dosen't work and can cause seveer pain and injury. This item is very unsafe. It pulls your skin and hair. PURE JUNK.......BUYER BEWARE."
1,This is a waste of money,"The Lumina Lighted hair Remover is a terrible product. The Battery (for operation) never made contact...so it didn't work.A piece of the plastic broke off, It was a waste of money. Don't bother"
2,Not worth it,"It did work well on soft, light, baby fine hair but overall I don't feel this purchase was worth it for me. Ended up throwing it out."
4,Works great,"This little trimmer is excellent for those problem areas where you don't want to use a razor. It is efficient and does the job. I can't say that the light adds much value, but as a trimmer, this one works great."
1,This thing is terrible,"I bought one, it worked for a few weeks, but since the parts are all plastic it broke. I thought, it was nice so I purchased another one...guess what, it worked for a couple weeks and broke too. Dont do what I did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,works as expected,"I have purchased two of these. I had the first for a year, and it still worked. I replaced it because the blades were getting a bit dull. It was the simpler, no light model. The second is the one listed with the light. I have to say the light stopped working after 2 months, but otherwise it still is working well. I use it for ""peach fuzz"" and to trim my eyebrows (be careful!). I have also used it when i miss a spot shaving around the knee area, it picks off those fine hairs nicely. This is a very inexpensive trimmer, and I am delighted to get a year's use for about $10. I did not expect such good results from a ""as seen on tv"" type product, but this does deliver. I would give it 5 stars if the light had not died so soon."
2,Finishing Touch,At first this little Lumina was okay. But the little motor in it doesn't have that much power to it. It didn't take long for the head to get dull either and there is no way of knowing or finding out where to get replacement heads for it.
2,Meh.,I used to use the smooth away thingy for the face( I only remove the sides of my lips) and it worked fine but the friction dried and irritated my skin. And plucking was too painful and I did NOT want to end up with the nasty side effects of shaving it. (Super black coarse hair blah blah) so I bougt=ht this at walgreens hoping it would remove the entire hair. It didn't its like a razor! I still saw tiny stubble and I had to remove it with my smooth away thing-____-' WASTE OF MONEY! I may use it on the bikini only. AND the heads were worth crap. With them on it didn't remove any hairs!
4,no light,"recieved this and starting using it but the light didnt work, i re read the instructions and it still didnt work. i guess the light was only a added feature."
1,WORTHLESS!!,"I have been buying products from Amazon for years but this is the only one that was really a waste of money. Description indicates that it ""removes hair""but it is actually a razor or it would be if it shaved any hair. It does not ""remove"" or shave hair. Don't waste your money. Buy a disposible razor, it is cheaper and it actually works."
2,Light doesn't work,"Am disappointed because I wanted a lighted hair remover. It's not worth the trouble sending it back just because of the light not working, though. The remover works adequately. I had another hair remover similar to this that I purchased from QVC that I liked much better. Unfortunately they don't carry it anymore."
2,Don't like results !,Let's see I bought this a few months agoand honestly it works but only temporary!! Welli used it on face and I am Hispanic so I do have facial hair and when I did try it on face my hairs grew back like when shaving ! My hairs came back shorter bur thicker!! I found it nice at first but unless u wax use lazer or pull the hairs follicles out they grow back!! I have used bleach and that seems to work better!
3,"Better than I was expecting, for the price!","I've bought a few different electric shavers from various brands that they sell at drugstores and places like that (ranging from $20-$50+) and they all seemed to break really fast or not work right, so when I saw this, I thought I'd give it a try, ut fully expected it to suck. When I tried it, it ended up working much better than expected! It it more of a trimmer than a shaver and you may have to go over an area a few times to get all of the hair, but it's not bad. The attachments didn't work worth a crap though. I found the shaver worked ok on the small patches of fine hair I have on my face (though wax works better) and it was great for my bikini line! I think the best thing about this is that so far it hasn't pinched or cut my skin at all when using it, so I feel comfortable using it in sensitive areas...nicks and pinches were my biggest issue with other shavers. FOr the price, you can't expect amazing quality or a super long life, but it does work!"
3,finishing Touch Lumina Lighted Hair Remover,it works fine but the light did not work and I did not want to take the time to send it back. But it does what it says it does.
1,Cheap,"I had thePanasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer, PinkFinishing Touch trimmer and I loved it until the blades got dull, so I thought I would try this one since I was at the store and it was so inexpensive. Well, it's cheap. Cheaply made, it fell apart out of the package, I rigged it back together and it didn't do a good job, not like the Panasonic. It doesn't leave my skin nearly as smooth, it does trim the hair, but tugs it sometimes as well. Not a good value."
4,Trimmer,"I tried to find this in the stores but was unable. I was happy to find it on Amazon. Shipping etc. went smoothly.Thanks,"
1,Waste of money,I bought this since I'm pregnant and I wanted something so I could go over my female parts easily to tidy up since shaving is more risky due to me not being able to see. Mine kept losing power. I threw it in the trash. I'm just going to pay to get waxed instead at this rate. At least then I don't have to do anything except go lay on a table!
1,Waste of money!!!!,"A girlfriend recommended the Finishing Touch Lumina Lighted Hair Remover.1. The light never worked.2. It 'buzzed' for a few seconds, then went dead.Waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,do not use it as an eyebrow remover,"I bought this hair remover as recommended from a friend. I wanted to use it as eyebrow remover, however, it does not work..."
1,No sirve,"Este trimer es una PORQUERÍA, lo compre dos veces y las dos veces se rompió al primer uso. El material del que esta construido es muy débil."
1,sucky,"This product really sucks. First of all, it does not do what it claims to do. Second of all, it broke after several uses. I learned my lesson. One should never stray from trusted brands when it comes to these made-in-China stuff."
1,"horrible product.... right out of the box and won't turn on,",out of the box it did not work. i emailed you quite a while back with this info. and asking for return instructions.....this is the only thing i received back!!
1,All around poor.,"Arrive nearly a week late. I was recommended this product by my friend who bought it at bed bath and beyonde. Her's works great, mine does not. There's not a good connection with the battery so it loses power when at certain angles and gets jammed frequently. Maybe mine is defective, but I'm very disappointed."
1,Don't bother,This is a dollar store quality shaver. The light never worked and the attachments don't either. Not a good system for facial hair removal since there is little control and it is a SHAVER. You don't want to remove facial hair this way. Stay away from this one.
5,Accept no imitiation!,"I made the mistake of buying a ""similar"" tool from CVS that literally fell to pieces. This is the best of it's kind and I couldn't find it anywhere else except online."
1,Darn!,I thought this was going to work a little better than it did! It only works if the hair is really long and the hair left is still partially long. I don't recommend getting this-just use a razor or tweezers or something like that.
3,Love it but it came broke,"Don't get me wrong I really like this product, however, it arrived and the light did not work. I ordered it through gohastings. It arrived very timely and they were willing to give me a refund if I wanted to ship it back. I really did not want to wait for another one, approx. 6-8 weeks, so I asked if they could send me one and I would return the one that I have in the envelope that they provide to me. They were not willing to take a chance over an $8.99 product. It seems that when I ordered it that I put my faith in them that they would deliver so I think that they should have put their faith in me that I would send the defective one back when the new one arrived."
5,Great Deal,I ordered the Finishing Touch about a month ago & was very pleased with my purchase. The price was perfect & it was shipped quickly just as I was told.
2,finishing touch,"this finishing touch is NOT what its cracked upto be. has hardly any power at all.maybe ok for traveling. but does not reallydo a very good job in removing hair, have togo the same spot a million times. :(("
5,it does what it says,I had one of these for years and it was dropped and broke. So I ordered this one from Amazon. It arrived quickly in good condition and works great and does what it's supposed to. I'm happy with my purchase and the Amazon price.
1,THIS THING IS A BATTERY OPERATED RAZOR!!!!,"I don't care what the infomercial claims, this thing is NOT an ""hair remover!!!!!"" I can't believe the positive reviews on here! It is a razor and I do not think it's a good idea for women to shave their fine facial hairs as it will make them thicker. It is better to pull them with some wax or tweezers. Also, the light does not even work. Buyer beware!"
2,Finishing Touch,"The light doesn't work that well to show what you are actually doing. The shave is not close, but does get rid of bigger hairs."
1,Cheap Junk,"The concept for this product is excellent. I bought mine at a beauty supply store and couldn't wait to try it. The one I bought turned out to be a cheap piece of flumsy junk. It does not do so well on the courser hair on chin/upper lip, but it does well on the finer hair on the sides of my face. I have to jiggle this thing a few times to get it to even start. When I turn it on, the light comes on but the ""shaver"" does not, unless I keep jiggling it for a few seconds. I think they should do some more research and make it a high quality device, but I would not recommend it at this time."
1,Do not waste your money,"The product broke as i was opening the package, do not waste your money! Its made of some cheep plastic that cannot be repaired what a waste of time"
3,Works great the first few months then dies off slowly,"I purchased this a while ago. I have two daughters who also use it in addition to me.I like how it comes with the brush and it's easy to take apart to clean the hair that gets inside. It worked great the first few months we had it. Then slowly it started slowing down so we replaced the battery. We got a few weeks of good use out of it and then it started slowing down again. Now no matter what its not fast anymore, we spend more time working on our eyebrows and somethings it gets stuck cutting a hair and pinches.For the price I guess I can't complain to much, I got my moneys worth. Next time I'm going to purchase one that I can replace the blades on and such."
4,good product,I use this for my face and like it.it works good and removes the hair quick and easy. I would purchase this product again.
3,Not all that...I'm just saying!,It was a generic trimmer and I wish I would have researched the product more. I found the same thing for five dollars less at the Family Dollar Store.
1,Don't bother with this product!,"I bought the original version (without the light) about a decade ago and it worked very well, but finally fell apart when my daughter started using it. We bought 2 of this new ""improved"" version and it doesn't clear a single hair away. At first I thought the batteries were just dying. But I've put in 2 new rounds of brand new batteries and the thing barely functions. Useless. Don't buy it!"
3,Be careful,I purchased this product before and since I liked it I bought another. The problem is the edges on the latest one I bought are sharp and you really have to use it carefully.
5,This product works great!,"This product works great! I don't understand all the negative reviews at all! I've had one of these before and it lasted forever so this is a replacement one from three years of using the other one. Love it! Just follow directions, make sure you clean it out and enjoy!"
2,The Rhodium plating came off after 1 year,"I wish the piece would have stayed shiny longer than 9 months. After that, the Rhodium plating began peeling off. Of course the company that sells the necklace doesn't offer any type of warranty. They told me to take it to a jeweler to have it re-Rhodiumed... Yea, like that'll cost less than the money I paid for the necklace.It was beautiful while it lasted."
1,Not impressed,"Very short string of cheap white Christmas-style bulbs with low-quality plastic coverings that don't stay put. Overall, this is a good concept with very poor execution."
5,"A review from an ""old friend""","It's been my pleasure to have known Pax Beale for 35 years. I knew him ""pre-body for the ages"", when he simply had what we used to refer to as a ""good build"". He & I were running buddies, and his coaching & companionship helped me to achieve many of my running goals. He has certainly had an incredible life of ""experience"". I can attest to the many zany challenges that he took on, which were held as crazy endeavors by his friends (& with which he now agrees). His book is a great deal to digest, but it certainly can motivate anyone who reads it to do SOMETHING to improve their life, both mentally & physically. So Pax, my friend, when will you be conducting your 1st Body for The Ages Seminar?"
4,I CONCUR,"Just saw Mel Waiters on the Blues Tour in Philadelphia. Great stage show. This 'Throwback Days' disc continues the saga. Keep 'em coming, Mel. I agree, Sir Charles is ok, but give me Mel Waiters."
1,A very bad topology book,"When a book is translated it is supposed to be in English... this book is in topology as a language of it's own. For me with a library and long history of reading topology books, it is understandable. The author is recognized as a great mathematician, but I think he should have had his maiden aunt read his proofs for the book... he writes badly of topology and his references aren't anywhere near clear enough. I suppose it is that I found that his treatment of the tetrahedron and projective plane really don't work well when translated to numbers...."
3,It's okay,"It's a decent book, and I remember that I really liked the parts about Esther. A little bit on the superficial side, but a good book nontheless."
3,George Perle: Orchestral Works,"I was a little disappointed by this CD. Perle does not seem to me to have been particularly fluent in orchestral writing. The intricate counterpoint that makes his style of carefully balanced serialism so convincing is largely lost in these recordings. The music is well-performed and written but seems strangely diluted. If you want to give Perle a try (and I hope you do) I enthusiastically reccomend the Dorian Quintet's recording of his wind quintets, some of the best in the genre."
3,Secrets the Pros Tell You Again and Again...,"Lou Krieger and Sheree Bykofsky, Secrets the Pros Won't Tell You About Winning Hold'em Poker (Lyle Stuart, 2006)I'd have to disagree with this book's title; it should have actually been Secrets the Pros Have Kept Telling You About Winning Hold'em Poker, But That You Haven't Listened to Yet. Yes, there's a great deal of information here that you've heard before, but it won't do you any harm to hear it again. Is it worth shelling out the cash? I can't tell you that; it depends entirely on how much of this is new to you. Some of it might be. Take it out of the library and give it a whirl before you buy it, however. ***"
4,Secrets about winning hold'em poker,Noted poker author and poker pro Lou Krieger (simply LOU!! to his friends) has provided all us recreational gamblers with a sort of one stop shop of top notch pro poker secrets and concepts.Kriegers 9th poker book will keep not often thought about poker concepts fresh in the minds of greatly experianced players.It will serve to illuminate these concepts for those players of somewhat limited experiance.I found it helpfull and deeply thought provoking. I will recomend it to my fellow intermediate level poker players wholeheartedly.This is one book at will find a place in my backpack for all my poker outings in the future.Thanks LOU !!timmer
1,Where are the secrets?,"I have to agree with one of the previous reviews. This book has the most misleading title I have ever seen. There is not one ""secret"" or subject on poker in the whole book which is not already in any of the other well known poker books.Somebody must have thought about how to squeeze some bucks out of the poker community and came up with a fantastic idea:Develop a promising title for a book, put in some standard poker knowledge and then ask some buddies to write positive reviews on Amazon.Their plan worked. They got my money and that of several others."
1,Buy something else,"This book's title has to be the most misleading book title I have ever encountered. ""Secrets the pros won't tell you about winning hold'em poker"" doesn't contain any insights that are not contained in dozens of other poker books. It is not a bad book, it just doesn't add much to the world of poker literature.If you want to read an authorative book about poker try Doyle Brunson's Super Sytem for some really detailed advice. Super System has the advantage of being written and endorsed by someone who is clearly one of the best players in the world... which can't be said for either of the authors of this very average book. (Also try Barry Greenstein's Ace on the River, another very interesting book by written by someone who has actually achieved great success as a player)"
2,Not secrets anymore!,"There are several points to make about this book. 1 The ideas presented in this book are common knowledge now. 2 The ideas are presented in a very elementary way that does not give depth and character to the thoughts, and their hidden meanings. 3 The book is the jack of all trades while not being great at any. Not a very good book and not full of secrets."
1,2 issues,They give you one piece that you are suppose to be able to cut into two usable pieces for all units. But you could only cut it into one usable piece for our unit. It smells! It makes the whole room smell!
5,Hunter pre filter sheet,"Original Hunter pre filter. It comes in a large folded sheet, depending on your model you should be able to get at least two filters out of it. My model specifically I should be able to get 4 maybe 5 from it. Good choice IMO"
4,hunter air filter,Have a pair of filters for over two years. They run constantly and work very well. A little to much noise for the bedroom for me and the filter cost does add up. I would buy these filters again and recommend them because of the volume of air thats filtered. The pre filter can be cut for two filters.
3,Carbon prefilter,Hunter QuietFlo Replacement Carbon Pre-FilterProduct was acceptable just took too long to get to me. I needed to call after almost 2 weeks to see when it would arrive. However it done arrive shortly after I called and they discounted my order $10 for delay.
2,wrong filter,I don't think this is the right pre-filter for the product I got. It will need to be cut to fit my Air Purifier.
4,Air Purfiers,I was able to purchase replacement filters through Amazon at the best price that I could find on the Internet. Mainly because shipping was free with this order.
5,Hunter HEPAtech Quiet FLO Air Purifier,The pre-filter for the Hunter Air Purifier is amazing. It is surprising to see how much it filters out of the air. This is a great air purifier and I hope to find one like this for a larger room. You can tell the difference in the air when you walk into the room. It is quiet enough to run in the bedroom.
1,Not the same,"This is a review for the product I received from Bulkfilter.com, not the actual Hunter 30901 product which I would rate at five stars.It didn't come in the Hunter box, which made me suspicious. Opening it, I found the weave much tighter than the Hunter product. This will reduce air flow. It is also thinner than the Hunter product, which will offset that slightly. The Hunter product makes little crumbs of activated charcoal, which this one does not, making it questionable whether it is an activated charcoal filter for odor control.If they are selling a generic filter, they should note that and people can choose whether they want that or the Hunter product. They shouldn't call it a Hunter 30901, because it isn't."
2,Not like the original,"I'm not sure that the ""5-star reviewers"" actually ordered this item. When compared to the original filter which came with the unit, it is MUCH thinner and flimsy. Also, there is NO way to get two filters out of this. It is too small. after cutting out one, there is less than 1/2 of the sized needed to make another. Do yourself a favor and order an original carbon pre-filter. I'm tossing this one and looking for the reall thing."
1,Watch out for this,The product came in a plastic bag and is not the same as the Hunter filters even though it is labelled as such here. I don't know how well it will work and I'm not taking chances. It was too cheap to bother sending back so I'm out the money.
2,Not the same,I was very happy with this product as I was with thefilter I got from the same company. This is the pre-filter and was not the same as the manufactuer. I had to cut this to fit and wasted a lot of un used filter....? Oh well
1,WARNING!! NOT THE RIGHT SIZE--UNCUT!!!,"Stupid me...I just assumed these would be the right size for my Hunter. NOT A WORD in the description stating they were uncut. I received NO instructions on how to cut these or what to use to cut them. If I knew I would have to take them to the hardware store to have them cut--I have no resources on hand that will cut this material--I would have bought a different product that was already the right size. If I can't get them cut somewhere soon, I will have to return."
3,Hunter replacement filter,"The filters were easy to change and seem to be fine. My problem with the actual air filter unit is that I am unable to reset it and keep it running. I've tried all the options given in the user manual yet, the machine starts up, then turns itself off at random times. My next step is to call the the help line and hope for resolution of the issue. I have better results with an Alen Filter that I own."
4,"not actual Hunter product, but works just as well","This is not an actual Hunter pre-filter, as it states. I guess the seller is afraid it will affect business if they state this in the description. I was irked by this, but I have to say that what they provide, a large sheet of carbon filter, which has to be cut to fit your air purifier, is actually large enough to make two pre filters."
3,Filter Size,The filters are far to big and I needed to cut them down. I did get a letter with the filters that this company will custom cut them so that is a good thing!
5,A Real Glimpse into America's Court,"As a criminal defense attorney for 20 plus years, I found this to be a brilliant look into the workings of a big-city criminal court, the attorneys and the differences between civil and criminal practitioners. It's a marvelous true story told with humor and erudition."
1,A Prisoner of Ideology,"The concept -- civil attorney gets involved in criminal trial and experiences revelations -- drew me to this book. However, in the concept's execution, the author's constant (and gratuitous) asides about ideological matters are so distracting and take away so much focus from the story that reading the book becomes very frustrating. Early on, when sitting in on voir dire to pick a jury the author remarks that the only question worth asking prospective jurors is ""What are your politics?"" Clearly that is how the author frames Life. The story would have been much more effective (and credible) if he had just told the story. The story actually would have spoken very well for itself without the need for the preaching."
1,Avoid This Book!,"The author is a weak, whiny fellow who spends the duration of this slender volume wallowing in self-pity at his wasted life. There are no insights about criminal trials nor criminal justice; the author is too much of a milquetoast to even do anything during the trial other than watch.I feel bad that the author is so unhappy in his profession; but then he graduated from Harvard Law in 1975, so it isn't like he had no choice in the matter.Geoghegan preferes to whine and complain, and it is excruciating for the reader to bear. At the end, this wasted little book leaves the reader with nothing but scorn for a bellyacher of an attorney too scared to do anything real with his life."
2,Disapointed,I was REALLY excited about this but was sort of disappointed. I stopped listening to it after a few days. I don't know - maybe I am not a true blues fan but it was hard for me to get hooked on any of these songs.
5,Wonderful and Enlightening,"This is fabulous book about the Book of Revelation.Rather than continue to be consumed by fanatical views of Revelation become enlightened.This book expanded my views and understanding like no other book I have read about this book in the Bible.Rather than stand on the sidelines waiting for signs of the end times,read this book and experience and understand the Revelation as we live it day by day.This is a very thought provoking book."
4,Reversed Thunder,"Book came promptly and was in good condition with some underlining as described.I'm not terribly enthralled with the book, but everyone in my Revelation study class seems to like it a lot. I find it hard to read...my mind wanders...but everyone else loves the style in which he writes and thinks it meaningful. I have not been a frequent student of the Bible, perhaps that's the problem. I was hoping for something a little more straight-forward."
2,A Difficult Book,"I have to say that I expected more from this book. We used this as our recent men's book club group which meets at 7am at a local cafe for breakfast. I learnt that 7am may be too early to read this book. Eugene is obviously a master with language but at times he left me in a wake of his poetic language and imagery. It was hard to follow - and when revelation is hard to follow, and the commentary commenting ON revelation is tough to follow then we are struggling. And our group consists to two lawyers, three seminary level guys, and professional educator (who loved the book by the way) and a P'hD scientist.If you are steeped in english literature, poetry and some philosophy then you might enjoy this, but otherwise the book is not a light read, nor is it easy to follow and so I personally would not recommend this book."
5,Two Talented People - One Tragic Story,"Paul Laurence Dunbar was a magnificent poet who is not known as well as he should be today. Alice Moore is a fascinating woman who deserves to be remembered in her own right. Together they would have seemed to be the perfect couple, living charmed lives. Sadly, their relationship was far from perfect. This book enables us to understand the forces that made these two talented people what they were, that drew them together, and that pulled them apart. Too often, African-American history deals only with slavery in the past and urban poverty in the present. This book shows the ""ebony elite"" that is too little known, in both its proudest and most difficult aspects. It is a fascinating story of individuals and of the culture that impacted their lives in many unfortunate ways. A compelling story, well-written."
5,Works great!,"I used this for a month trip to switzerland and italy and a 10 day trip to the bahamas using ONLY this backpack. Extremely comfortable on longer walks... and blends in to the crowd very well. I did have one of the internal compression strap connectors (little plastic clip) break on me, because I was way over tightening it. This backpack also meets carryon size for pretty much all airlines. I've never had a problem getting into the overhead bins. I'm planning to buy another one of these for my fiance on a trip to spain/france next year. I do recommend getting a smaller backpack with it... I use rick steves little backpack whenever I need to travel a little lighter and for day trips."
4,Ideal for short trips,"Took two of these on a recent trip, and I was very happy. I'm a girl with a small frame and had no problems carrying this - another reviewer here feels differently though, so perhaps it depends on your needs. I didn't take this hiking and can't vouch for its performance there. Great for backpacking travel though, if your trip is relatively short and you want to travel light. Very sturdy and survived being checked into airport luggage on the way back. It could use a few more pockets, but otherwise I was very happy and would definitely go for High Sierra again; I doubt I'd pay the exorbitant list price, but on Amazon this is an excellent deal."
1,Not as strong as you would expect,"Oh I am not happy with it - the stitches came off and the material in front looks so worn out, all this is less than 6 months' of careful use. This looks good and all that jazz, but not a strong bag. There is a lot of space in there, but be careful the bag cant handle a lot of weight.. only for light and easy stuff."
3,Acceptable,"I purchased a Dorcey 3,000,000 candelight spotlight. Does nice job of producing a bright light for looking into woods behind my house. I live in a rural setting in Connecticut and, at night, my dogs hear and see things, that I cannot see. So, I fire up the Dorcey and then I see what they see. I really like the fluroescent light that comes with light. It saves battery life when used instead of main spotlight. The only negative aspect is the spotlight feature really shortens the battery operational time. It does not last long at all. I guess you cannot use it as a long term emergency light, except when using the fluorescent, which does a good job of lighting a small area. Still, I am glad I bought it."
5,Great Flashlight,"I love this flashlight. This light is extremely bright. I use it for taking my dog out into the back yard at night. I no longer need to turn on the outside lights when I go out. I also had one of these lights die on me, but it died because the switch was left on when it was charged. There is a warning on the flashlight not to do this or the warranty will be void. I was extremely disappointed when the flashlight died, because I loved it so much. It is a little big, but for my use it is perfect. This light is as bright as a police car spot light."
1,"Very bright, then died",It was great while it lasted. Brilliantly bright.Then - it died. Got very few uses out of it.
1,Don't Do It!,"I chose this light because I had the 1M Candle Spotlight but I dropped it. I thought this would be better, but it's far worse. The purpose was to walk my senior dog at night, on an unlit wooded trail. As in the other reviews, it takes 15 hours to charge fully, but then you only get 15 minutes of bright, 3M Candle light. After that, you may as well be holding one candle for all the light it's giving you. The booklet says you will have 30 minutes, which would be ideal, but I haven't had that since I charged it the first time. This one's garbage...don't waste your money. (Now I've got to figure out how to get my money back!)"
1,Failed after 3 months.,"The drive worked fine for three months( Mid-August to Mid-November) and then failed.I just called Seagate and was told they will send me a ""refurbished"" drive as a replacement. They sent me a hard drive in a box with a 2003 copyright. I am not sure if this is older technology than the original or not but the packaging was from an earlier incarnation of the drive.A bad first experience with external hard drives. I will not buy from Seagate again."
1,Disappointing device - not as depicted,The delivered device looked nothing like the picture. Instead a a small USB powered device it is a hulking big box with a (large) external power supply so useless for travelling and certainly not portable. Very disappointing.
4,Good drive.,"I studied the Amazon.com reviews for numerous USB disk drives of roughly similar size, and this drive had the best reviews (at the time I bought it, anyway). I've had the drive for about 2 weeks and it works great. My computer, running Windows 2000 Pro, recognizes it within a few seconds of turning on the drive; the switch is really convenient, and I leave the drive off until I need it. Unfortunately, the ""award winning"" backup software would not run on my computer. As soon as the software starts up, Windows reports an error and shuts down the software. Thus, the backup button on the drive does nothing. However, I bought the drive for the disk space, and I'm pretty happy with it so far.Update (April 2012). Well, this drive is still working fine after about 6 years. Actually, I purchased a second one shortly after buying the first one - both are still going strong. I still turn them off when not in use, which probably contributes to the longevity. Seagate makes a pretty good drive."
2,power loss/disconnect = total data loss,1 day after installing this drive on an osx laptop and filling it with mp3's the power cord to the drive got disconnected. on reconnect the drive was no longer accessible and i was asked to initialize it. i took it to a winxp machine and it also asked if i wanted to format the drive as it was unreadable. now that's some pretty shakey tech. not sure if it's a firewire issue or the drive itself. ymmv
2,a disapointment,not as versatile as i hoped. the grooves are not deep enough to hold so it really only fits the largest. I can still use it until I find one that better suits my needs.
4,Works well for 75% of my pots and pans,"I tested this with 5 frying pans, 1 sauce pans, 2 stock pots. Six had a tight seal; two did not.A stock pot failed because it was old and the rim had warped, so this relatively flat lid did not seal well.The other failure had to do with the fact that this lid needs 6"" clearance from the center of the pan. It provided an excellent seal on a 12"" fry pan that had a raised handle, but it did not provide a good seal on the smallest (9"") fry pan because its handle extended higher than the rim of the pan, within six inches of the center of the pan.I really like the steam vent."
2,Not what I expected,"I was really disappointed in this lid. First off, it will not work with any of your pots/pans that have a handle that comes up above the sides of the pot/pan. This wasn't obvious to me before I purchased the lid, but once I received the item and noticed it, I felt pretty stupid (it's pretty obvious that it wont work). Second, once you do find a pot/pan that it will fit on top of, the ridges are not very deep and the lid does not stay on secure at all. Having these two things is an obvious fail to me, and I am sending this item back! The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the quality of the metal is pretty good, not entirely a piece of junk."
5,Fits the bill--and the pans,"This lid is perfect for me. It's sturdy, fits my pans, has a vent and goes through the dishwasher just fine."
3,Disappointed,"I choose this lid over other ones and I am very disappointed. There is nothing that I can do with this lid that a sheet of heavy duty foil couldn't do but, I guess that's my opinion. I just do not understand all of the great reviews on this lid."
4,Very pleased with this item,I bought this item to carry with me in our Motor Coach. We are very limited in weight that we can pack and this item serves me very well. It fits all of the pots and pans I have. I only have one skillet that it will not work with and that is because the way the handle is made.
2,"Fits everything, but badly","I got this lid for a 12 inch skillet. It covers most of the skillet, but not enough to give a tight seal. Rather it perches precariously just inside the rim, slipping to the side if jostled. So I decided to try it on a few smaller pots that don't have lids. Again, rather than fitting, it balances precariously on top of them. The material feels cheap, and the dome and handle take up a lot of space in the cabinet. It works, but had I known what I know now, I wouldn't have purchased it."
5,Great quality!,I have been looking for a universal lid (that fits many size pans) for several years. This one is very high quality and I am very pleased with it!
4,Very useful,"I haven't used too many universal lids, this one being the first :) It's useful for most of my pans. I have two 12"" pans, and this lid can barely cover the whole thing. Otherwise, very useful kitchen tool."
1,Also almost worthless,"Will not lay flat on any small pan that has handles - fry pans, sauce pans. Might be good for sauce pots, I am not sure. sounded good on paper. Will kepp it since it might be useful somewhere."
5,great lid just what needed I,"it was all that i expected and wanted, fits it cleans anand stores easily and fits all my pots and pans"
5,I love this lid!,"This lid is of good quality metal and fits most of my pots and pans ferfectly. The domed lid has proven a bonus for times when the pan is a bit too full, and the vent is also a nice extra feature. I would definitely recommend this product."
3,It works okay,I've tried this on my 8 and 10 inch frying pans and it works ok. Caution the handle gets hot so you need a mitt to pick it up!
2,Not as wonderful as I believed it would be.,"OK, so all my pots and pans have lids except for one Pampered Chef Fry Pan. I had/have a Calphalon glass lid that covers but does not 'fit' it. So I thought I'd purchase this one to do it. I did not realize how much I 'look' at the food cooking through glass lids and how much easier the glass is to clean, unlike this one. Also, there's this huge area sticking out over the edge of the pan that took away from my grip on the handle. I used it once. It's already out of sight at the local Goodwill."
3,Doesn't quite fit my 12 inch frying pan,"Like:-The dome shape design for better cooking w/ steam-The groove rings to adjust to different size pots and pansDislike:-Doesn't fit 12 inch pan (at least didn't fit my Cusinart frying pan), the grooves don't align w/ the pan properly-steam vent is flimsy"
4,Universal lid,"Would have preferred a small and bigger/non stainless steel/ with vent version, but was happy to find any universal lid."
3,Unknown commodity,"I returned this item because I was not aware, when I ordered it, that it was manufactured in China.I avoid purchasing any food-related items that come from China because there is NO guarantee what materials have been used in the manufacture of those items and whether or not those materials are safe ... ESPECIALLY if there is a finish or coating that might leak some substance, into the food, once it is subjected to heat and/or open flame. Or how those materials will 'morph' after multiple visits to the dishwasher!Be aware of anything that comes in contact with your food!"
4,Universal lid - dimensions,"Reasonably good quality stainless lid. For those needing dimensions, they are:Overall outside diameter: 12 3/8""Diameter inside rolled edge: 12 1/8""Diameter across dome: 7 3/4""Height of dome: 1 1/2""So, the largest pan this lid will work well on is, say, 12 1/16"". Beyond that, the rolled edge will prevent a stable fit."
1,"RSVP Unvlersal Lid has Skimpy Diameter/..., Found Better/Cheaper!","This lid barely covers a 12"" pan, and easily slips to the side... The High metal handle also makes it Bulky to store/Hot.Found a much cheaper 12 1/4"" Universal Stainless Lid at Wal Mart with an outer lip that secures it from slipping, and a Glass inner viewing insert so you can view cooking.... Low profile bakelite/cool touch handle."
4,Great multi-pot lid,"This lid is great for use on lots of differently sized pots and pans. Fits on my largest pan. Easy to clean, sturdy. I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,Trying to keep a Lid on it,"While it looks good, its functionality is sorely lacking. The ridges that are intended to keep the top on are insufficiently deep and the top keeps sliding about. Also if the handle of the pot or pan angles above the top of the pot it will prevent the lid from properly seating.Ended up returning for full credit."
4,Veratile,I am VERY happy with this lid--great purchase decision for me. I was actually considering buying a couple of cookware pieces just so I would have pots with lids but this worked great. Just check your handles to make sure they are not positioned upward where they would be in the way. I have Cooks Standard Cookware and will find this top very useful especially for my 10 inch fry pan. I also have some other sauté pans that were without lids. This does the job.
5,Perfect,"Exactly what I wanted. I purchased it to fit a 12 in skillet and it works perfect. Also fits my 10 in skillet and my Dutch oven. Love the fact that it has a vent on it too. It's little lighter than I thought, but that shouldn't be a problem."
2,D note is off,As another reviewer mentioned...the D note is not on key. All the other notes are in tune. Thought it was worth mentioning in case anyone wondered if it was an isolated occurance.
2,Just OK,"Not satisified with what I was promised. Shipping took a bit longer that expected and the pitchpipe, if you blow hard vibrates like it's feed back. The case was broke to pieces and worthless. You need to blow very soft and very very very long to make this work. I'll throw it in the bag !"
2,All but the D note,The pitchpipe works great on all notes except the D. I ordered the Violin one as well and the same problem. Will not order this model again. I would like all notes to be correct.
4,Cuddly Cub,"I bought this stuffed toy because one of my 16-month-old granddaughter's favorite words was ""kitty,"" which she used for all of her stuffed toys. Although she does not have either asthma or allergies, I thought this because it looked cute and was just about the right size. It quickly became one of her favorite toys that had to go everywhere with her. Three months later, she is still enjoying it, and it seems to be holding up well to lots of cuddling."
2,pathetic stories especially for the price!,"I thought it was going to be better stories than this. A couple were pretty good, but after all the pet sitting he has done, seems like he could've picked several more interesting."
2,worst album cover ever,it's hard to even make out the title of this album because the artwork is so bad. just looking at the cover puts me in a bad mood.
3,Is this your first time?,"Audit in Progress is a great cd it really is but for me when I bought this cd I actually thought it sucked and was pissed that I had purchased it. Automatic Midnight is one of the best cds of all time, every track on that cd is kill. I heard that and immediately ran out to the store in search of it only to find that Audit was the only one they had. I thought Hot Snakes would be Hot Snakes and awesome all around but oh was I wrong. As good as this cd is it's not their best..I didn't like it til I had listened to it through a few times and it finally grew on me. The lyrics don't seem real solid to me, kinda just like they threw em together last minute. The music itself though is top notch. The first half of the cd is great..in fact that's about all I usually listen to. So this one- well if you're a fan already then go for it. If not then you better set this one back on the shelf and grab AM. You won't regret it."
1,"""Can't Believe""","I can't believe that the title of this cd is the best of Hugh Masekela. One of his most commercial success recordings, ""Grazing in the grass"" is not on this cd. ""Riot"", and ""Puffin on the the track"" are other commercial tunes that he recorded that aren't on this cd. How in the world can any one call something the best of, with out putting the best of on the cd. Who ever titled this cd, needs to be musically educated on and about MR. Masekela music.T. LA.California"
5,Insightful commentary on modern issues.,"Thomas Sowell is one of the finest critical thinkers of our time. More than that, he is uniquely able to state his views in a manner that is both comprehensive and concise. Few authors are able to pack as much valuable analysis into each line as Thomas Sowell.This latest collection of his provocative essays will challenge the presumptions and beliefs of many people, especially in America. Sowell has a special talent for slicing through fallacies, poor research, and ""mushy"" thinking, and getting to the truth in practically any controversy. He's logical, but at the same time he writes from a 'common sense' perspective that can be readily understood by everyone. Everyone except, perhaps, the ""anointed ones.""Covering culture, economics, politics, law, race, and education, the essays in this book will challenge your understanding of the world, as well as your thoughts on how society should deal with the many issues it faces."
5,Thomas Sowell writes so clearly and always makes you think.,"I've read about 6 of Sowell's books and learnt from every one of them. They are interesting, well written and easy to read.Is the West going to sink into socialist mush or rise above it? If people are brainwashed and led by socialists, the future is bleak. If enough people learn to think logically and clearly there's hope. Read this book, and others by Sowell, and learn to think and reason. You might be surprised at how things really work, and how empty the socialist slogans and rhetoric are."
3,Same old Stratton,"Although I have respect for Stratton as a pit bulldog expert, I disagree with many of his claims and beliefs. He is too supportive of dog fighting. He encourages the use of the pit bull as a protection dog. He talks mostly about the macho uses of pit bulls - hog hunting, weight pull, bulking the dog up for big muscles and stamina, etc. He seems to love pit bulls in the same way a man loves to watch football or jack up a pickup. He sure knows a lot about them. But he has no real meaningful connection to them. It's very hard to read a book written by an author with such a detachment. I recommend this book only as a resource when doing research on pit bulls. But I don't think it is a quality book for people who are interested in getting a pet pit bull, or for people who want to learn about the many wonderful things that pit bulls can do."
1,it's a joke,"I have read this joke of a book. the author:richard f stratton,sure like the pitt bull,and that's ok. but he speak's down on the other fighting breeds. like the english bull terrier,the american bulldog,the tosa,and more. i lived in central america a longe time,and have seen many mathes. he dont know much about fighting dog's. that's a fact! dont by it!"
3,I 'm melting,"I had the Malibu 300 watts transformer first but I had 300 watts on the circuit too much draw. It melted the terminals, so I bought 600 watt transformer and it worked fine for a year. I split the current draw into two circuits one with 120 watts and the other 180 watts. The terminals on the 180 watt curcuit melted. It has a simple plastic connection, but I have not been able to buy the parts to repair it. So? It looks like I will have to buy another transfromer."
2,Proofreader needed,"I am an EE, but not an RF expert. The book may have a lot of useful information, but I can't tell what is correct and what isn't. Even with my limited RF knowledge, I found a huge number of typos, especially in the last couple of chapters, some questionable math, a severe lack of math and theory to back up the ""practical"" hints, and a frustrating inability by the author to express himself clearly. For example, he discusses electrical line length for many pages, but never defines it. He provides many anecdotes about VSWR, but does not provide enough math or theory to tie them all together into a useful picture. It seems to me that the content is much too spotty to be useful to a designer; it might be more helpful to an RF equipment operator with very limited technical and math skills."
3,It was okay,"Nobody's There starts off like this, Abbie gets mad at her father for leaving her and her mother and brother, and commits a crime with out thinking. The judge asigns her to a program called Friend to Friend, where she gets assigned to a crabby old lady, Mrs.Murkle. Mrs.Murkle sees herself as a private investigator. She knows the scoop on everyone.One day Abbie goes over to Mrs.Murkle's house, to find Mrs.Murkle sprawled on her living room floor with a major head injury. Abbie vows to find who tried to kill Mrs.Murkle.The plot isn't too original. It's kind of boring at times and the end wasn't really exciting. To me the most disappointing thing in the book was the ending. It didn't really have a climax. But, it was okay. I wouldn't read it again."
2,Nobody's There,i thought this book was boring... Maybe for a way younger audience it is alright but i dont recommend for any one else
2,The book sent is wrong,I ordered for the verion of this book that discusses African countries and I was sent the one for South America
5,Quality OEM replacement,"Quality OEM replacement for my 2000 Acura Integra LS. This Bosch has anti-seize grease on the threads. O2 sensor is one of the easiest car repairs. Once up on ramps, 5 minutes max. Greatly helps with performance and gas milage."
1,Misuse of the Logo of Everything Existing,"The use of the Enneagram in the way this and other books teach is a complete fraud. It is a travesty of a very holy diagram. This typology was invented by certain self declared ""hasnamussian"" teachers at Esalen and elsewhere who had no contact with anyone in the chain of teachers directly from Gurdjieff. The Enneagram is a cosmic diagram more akin to what astrophysisists work with. In the beginning was the Enneagram...the Logo.It would not matter if it lead people to the real thing, but most seem satisfied with the dreams of growth this false system gives.If you read this, be advised that the Enneagram was given by G. I. Gurdjieff, it was unknown until and has not been found anywhere except where he first promulgated it. This was as he is quoted by P.D. Ouspensky in 'In Search of the Miraculous'. Any materials published from the circles authentically maintaining this remarkable teaching of The Fourth Way ever use the diagram as a system of personality types."
5,Best intro to the Enneagram on the market,"This is about the tenth copy I've purchased. I give it to people who are new to the Enneagram. I'm partial to Riso & Hudson's work, and I personally think that ""Wisdom"" is the best general introduction available for non-professionals. The visual display of information helps to make points very clear. The text is clear as well, and it is also sensitive and profound. Riso & Hudson's skillful treatment of the subject in this volume helps to spread understanding of the Enneagram. I believe that we can all benefit from its wisdom."
4,A popular extension of Personality Types Revised Edition.,"Done in something of the format that made The Artist's Way such a popular success, Don Riso and Russ Hudson have made a fine, though busy, addition to their body of work. For me, nothing will ever replace their extraordinary accomplishments in Personality Types, Revised Edition; it will remain the ""highly recommended"" systemtatic bible and centerpiece for anyone truly studying and applying the enneagram in depth as its horizontal and vertical revelations unfold in an increasingly integral world. I found the omission of an index disappointing, but have nothing but gratitude and respect for anything Riso and Hudson add to the enneagram literature with their incomparable precision and vision. I don't know if I'd call this the ""complete guide"" to either psychological and spiritual growth or the nine basic types, but -- bravo, nonetheless."
2,Wisdom of Enneagream,Book was not what I expected and it was written in a little bit. I don't like that.
5,A user's guide to human behavior,"This is the best book that I have ever read on personality types.It even eclipses Myers-briggs in that it outlines WHY we are the people that we have become. Though there is a lot of information, the author leads the reader in small enough steps to not only grasp the material, but to comprehend the potential of our own growth and the way foward in our lives. Un missible for those that work in larger groups or want to understand their families and loved ones better."
3,Only part of the bigger picture,"This book lent good insight into what, in this lifetime, brought on personality traits. It also tends to set up a personal bias that could make us believe there is little room for change."
5,Looking within,"Looking within ourselves and discovering our own possibilities can be an emotional, painful & yet liberating endeavor. Wisdom of the Enneagram has been a vital tool for me to develop better understanding of myself, my family & friends.If you read this book you'll open your mind and the mystery of you...Take this quiz first, then order the book and enjoy discovering yourself..[...]"
5,Riso and Hudson have done it again!,"Yet another excellent book on this extraordinary personality typing system from best-selling authors Don Riso and Russ Hudson. They keep taking this material deeper and deeper, and bringing their readers ever more thoughtful insights into the power of the Enneagram, which has broad applications in the realms of both work and love. A must-read."
3,Excellent Source for Self Reference,"I found this book to be quite interesting. However, it did seem to emphasize the negative aspects of almost all of the personality types. Thus the 3 stars. It is probably the best beginners book for the enneagram. It goes into a lot of detail regarding the types, wings, etc."
2,Depends very much on your car,"This fit great for a Toyota Corolla due to access, but I needed to use an adjustable wrench because none of my sockets fit the piece. It was incredibly hard to get access to tighten the darn thing on my BMW, so it was not on as tightly as it should have and it leaked. The gold hand piece also stripped trying to hand tighten it. I would not recommend this for BMWs."
5,De La Cabeza a Los Pies,"This book is excellent! We use it in our Spanish classes and the students love to ""move"" like the animals in the book. It's a great tool for teaching about the parts of the body and animals.Deborah, Lessons From Abroad"
3,"great story, terrible format","my son loves this book. he loves doing all the things the animals do. however, it is a very big book and it's not a board book. so the pages are very difficult for my toddler to turn. plus we had to actually keep the book away from him for awhile because he wants to tear the pages. only recently he learned to not tear the pages in books, but i still have to supervise him with this book because he can rip the pages accidentally since it's so big and awkward for him to manage. i wish i would have noticed it wasn't a board book when i bought it. that said, my son does love love love having this book read to him."
5,FANTASTIC,"GREAT BOOK!! Helps identify body parts and my toddler mimics the animal antics, such as pounding his chest to show what a gorilla does. The book is in Spanish and its great for those parents teaching a second language."
4,Great!,My kids are able to follow the book by imitating animal body movements and learn about their body parts. It's an easy read or a great story to read to kids!
2,WAY TOO BIG,"The english version comes in a board book that is 5X3 around size. The spanish one is 11X7!!! No board book and REALLY BIG! I am so upset. I was sending this to a child we sponsor in Nicaragua and they wont allow a package that long, so now we have a book that he should have JUST because this author didnt make it smaller in spanish. GRRRR. The english version is FANTASTIC, the spanish one is too big for a toddler."
3,a must for collectors,"great album to review the evolution of john mellencamp!! Lots of cover songs being sung by a young eager singer. Great for collectors. The music isn't his best work, but well worth a listen."
5,Fun heist movie,"This is a great popcorn movie. It's clever, fast-paced, good dialog, fun characters, and a slew of great actors. Yeah, no one's going to mistake Mark Wahlberg's performance for Oscar-worthy but it's still fun. The only downside is that the usually remarkable Edward Norton feels like he's just going through the motions."
4,"Railroad History of the Sacramento Mountains - Cloudcroft, NM","There are few books that tell the story of the logging railroad at Cloudcroft, New Mexico. Detail and story content are good, though the book could have better continuity. Still, it provides information about the now defunct line that would be difficult to find without much time and effort. It is well worth the purchase price, if you have specific interest in the railroading history of Otero County, or southern New Mexico."
5,Back in Cedar Cove!,"Well I decided to pay another visit to one of my favorite towns, Cedar Cove. All of our regular townspeople are in 311 Pelican Court, but we take a few twists and turns, unexpectedly and with great delight!I have seen all the other reviews, and they cover it all. I can't say anything here that hasn't already been said. However, these books are addictive and Debbie Macomber has created a little town, that this reader would love to be a part of, and I am so glad I can, even if for only a short time!"
2,Dull,"Just as boring as 74 Seaside Ave. Forced myself to finish it. The ""plot"" was even sillier. All the coy interchanges between supposed couples . . . really?"
4,311 Pelican Court,"This is my 3rd Cedar Cove novel and I plan on reading all of them. I like that you get to know all the people in this small town. There is a little mystery,a little romance and lots os fun."
5,Book purchases,I have purchased many books from Amazon and quite a few from this sellers. The books are always in the shape that is described by the seller and I receive them on time.
5,Very Entertaining and a Feel Good Kind of Read,I just finished 311 PELICAN COURT by Debbie Macomber and it really was a touching book. I love how you see glimpes of several different peoples lives and somehow they all intertwine. I defintely want to read the others and will be on the look for the next in the Cedar Cove Series.I think I found a new favorite author in Debbie Macomber.
5,Awesome,"Debra Torok is a great pianist. I happen to know her personally. She now lives near Cochranville, PA and plays for the Red Brick Players, a local theater group."
5,The best book!,"I think that this book is awesome because I love to learn about the American revolution, and I think that the battles in the South were the most amazing of them all because they were not armies but frontiersman who were fighting and won most of the battles. This book helped me understand what the American army had to go through. It also helped me understand that the American army wasn't really a big army, until France helped the Americans. This book is awesome!"
5,American Revolution well written,I love the American Revolution and this book tells it beautifully.It goes into pretty good details on the battles. Sometimes you would think the author experienced the Revolution himself. That's how well written it is.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read and hear about the American Revolution or someone who wants to learn about it.
5,The American Revolution (Landmark Books),"I got this Kindle ebook for my daughter for summer school and she enjoyed it very much. She liked the fact that there weren't a lot of pages to read. That made her feel positive towards this book from the start. She also loved the ""text to speech"" so when her eyes got tired, she could listen as an alternative. And it is very educational."
2,Picking Apples and Pumpkins,"It may have been written, but I did not realize this book would not include both English and Spanish text (as the title does). The text of the book is in Spanish only. The photos are very nice."
1,Wouldn't buy again,Consistancy was very watery compared to other brands. Price was high. Color didn't last. I would not waste my time or money on this product again.
2,The color is neat... for about two days.,"I think the color is swell- I love how it looks right after I dye my hair, but the pigment washes out almost immediately. So in order for the pink to be able to even linger in your hair, you'd have to refrain from washing it. Too pricey for the quality in my opinion."
3,Nice but not lasting,"I did a dip dye in pink with the hair dye and at first it looked pretty cool, even without bleaching my natural blond hair, but after washing my hair 2-3 times the color was completely out."
3,The Icelandic Version of a Kid N' Play Movie,"Well, that's what my friend said, anyway. And he was pretty much on the mark...as far as the basic plot goes.Axel, the main character is the perfect slacker from 1992. There are a lot of nice shots of Reykjavík, many funny scenes with mobsters and metalheads...and lots of leggy girls in tights.Björk (Gumundsdóttir) performs two songs on the soundtrack of this film that was originally titled Sódóma Reykjavík: a 50s rockabilly cover with a group called KK Band (""O Borg Min Borg"") and ""Takk""--which she wrote--and performs with DJ ór (órhallur Skúlason). In 1992, director Óskar Jónasson was dating Björk--he had directed many Sugarcubes videos."
3,Fans of dance would give a grade 1 or 2 higher,"Danish (like Aqua) dance music, on this track using a harmonica as the gimmick. If you are a fan of the genre this band should be great. Produced by experienced DJ Kenneth Bager. A profesional result, it's got hit potential (a hit in Denmark, anyway)."
1,"plod plod , bore bore , zzzzzzzzz","somewhere online i read this was a ""masterpiece"" and picked it up . one critic said it was "" so frightful i had to put it down"" . well i found the writing so poor and the suspense non existent that i too had to put it down . slow ,long drawn out writing that goes no where.. i read 100 pages and have given up . as to all the great reviews well maybe they,re from this area of sweden where its cold and boring all day ......zzzzzzzzz"
2,Tedium,"""So frightening I had to stop reading from time to time...... But then I was compelled to return to it..."" So the critic says. Well, I disagree.... so tedious in its descriptions and dragged out plot line[s] that I had to stop reading it!! I was compelled to return because ...... I hate giving up, even if the storyline is driving me to distraction!"
4,comment,"The reading enjoyment was marred only by typos and some awkward sentences. The U.S. publisher should have sprung for a quick copyread, which would have caught these annoying errors."
3,A challenging read,I read this after Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (which I enjoyed) but couldn't ever quite get to grips with the story. Why would people want to live in such a challenging and hostile environment? No wonder they all seemed a bit disturbed. If you're into crystals then you'll prob. enjoy this boo
3,Not at all like Barbara Vine,"Although there were times I enjoyed sections of this book, I was completely disappointed by the ending. Most of the people were depressing and/or depressed. Ekman even managed to make nature depressing. I finished it right to the end, but I would not do it again."
5,Oldie but goodie,Sadly these hardcopies are getting harder to find. This one is close to vinyl in sound quality.
1,If you need help staying awake...,"If you need help staying awake then this is the clock for you. It's just your basic, inexpensive, little alarm clock; simple to operate and easy to read. It is, however, very lightweight and flimsy, and one of the loudest ticking clocks I have ever encountered. Put it on your nightstand next to the bed any time you need to stay awake!"
3,packaging,"The clock was mailed and the order arrived on time. However, as it was for my 93 year old mother, it was important to have a set of instructions for it's use. There were no instructions contained in the package, nor was this noted on the page when I ordered it. In searching the web, I was also unable to find an instructions on line. She finally had to has the maintenance man in her assisted living facility to help her."
4,"Silent, nice but durable?","I've had a few of these, which attest to their desirability but lack of durability. 2 of the 4 broke after a year or so, but I'm going to get yet another since, while they work, they're great! And they're cheap!Good points are:1) Silent!2) Big convenient snooze button also turns on the light, which with fresh batteries makes a night light in a pinch3) Easy to read and set4) AttractiveUPDATE (after finally opening the package):IT'S NOT SILENT! IT TICKS SOMEWHAT LOUDLY. Major bummer.It is in all ways identical to the silent ones I've had except that it ticks!New Rating: 2 Stars."
3,LACK LUSTER,THE CLOCK IS OK AND LOOKS AND PERFORMS AD SHOWN BUT I GET DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU PAY AS MUCH FOR A SHIPPING AS THE PRODUCT WHEN CLEARLY IT IS NEITHER HEAVY OR BULKY AND YOU THINK I JUST PAID FOR THIS PRODUCT TWICE. I GUESS IT IS EITHER THE PRICE OF CONVENIENCE AND MORE CHOICES THAN DRIVING AROUND AND NOT FINDING WHAT YOU WANT. I JUST THINK SOME VENDERS USE SHIPPING AND HANDLING AS A PROFIT CENTER AS MUCH AS THE PRODUCTS THEY SELL.
3,Oldie but Goodie,"I was intentionally looking for an old edition of this book as a special gift to someone adopting a child. The condition of the book was EXCELLENT! Things have really changed in adoption over the years, so it's not the best book for 'education' younger children....but the sentiment is always the same. LOVE of children!"
5,The Chosen Baby,I read this book to my adopted children 45 years ago. It was great to find a book that stressed the chosen aspect for them and helped to make them feel like the very special people they were. Now I want a copy to give to a young couple who have recently adopted a little boy. I hope Amazon can help me so I can help someone else.
1,Unchoosing the Chosen Baby,"Although the story is nice as far as it goes, it brought up to me the question of whether I could be sent back to the agency just as easily as I was adopted. It seems to be too much of a transaction with choices. If my parents could select me over other children, what would stop them from sending me back, in the event they were not satisfied?"
5,Two great symphonies in the hands of one great conductor,"Between 1985 and 1995, American-born Swedish conductor Herbert Blomstedt helped to elevate the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra to the same level of excellence enjoyed by its counterparts in Los Angeles, Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York.This recent London/Decca re-pairing of the orchestra's recordings of Mendelssohn's celebrated Italian Symphony and Schubert's equally celebrated Unfinished Symphony is proof that Blomstedt had his conducting powers well in hand. The orchestra gives very even and very excellent performances of these two symphonic hallmarks under Blomstedt's great guiding hand.Given this, it is hoped by this viewer that this same orchestra and conductor's equally superlative recordings of Beethoven's Symphonies Nos. 1 & 3 will make a return to CD as well."
5,Definite Recordings of Scubert 8th & Mendlessohn 4th,"Often overlooked as one of our great conductors, Herbert Blomstedt's celebrated recordings of these symphonies are available now in a new release. Both performances are listed as definitive for their respective works. Blomstedt does a fine job emphasizing the rich musical architecture of both scores without injecting his own personality. And the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra plays at the level one expects from a first rate American or European orchestra. Those who say that the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra attained its excellent level of playing under the baton of Michael Tilson Thomas should listen to this splendid recording; one of many distinguished recordings Blomstedt made with this orchestra. I agree completely with a previous reviewer who noted Blomstedt's excellent work in shaping this orchestra into one of America's best."
3,Popcorn great but shipping is outrageous,"I bought it before. Pops up small and crunchy. Loved it. Shipping cost the same as the popcorn....$10. But this time when I went to order it shipping was $14. That's where I draw the line. When it costs more to ship it than the product costs, then I don't need it."
3,didn't pop,The popcorn did not pop in my hot air popper. I called the company and emailed them to return it. Never got a response.
5,Delicious soft kernels,"Kernels are small and softer than traditional white corn. Great flavor even eaten plain. My traditional is with flax oil and real salt, tarragon optional if I want a savory corn. I was informed cinnamon is good too."
4,Liked Amish Blue Popcorn,We microwave it without oil and really like it. It has very little hull. This is the first time we tried it and will purchase it again.
1,didn't pass the vinegar test,"no good. total fake product. I did the vinegar test and nothing. I even sent it back and got my money back. It is make in Canada, no offense, but it is a total waste and will not break down in the stomache."
5,iron shelf,Looks great in my new hallway. I received the item about 3 days before I thought it would arrive.
5,Inside Job,"Without demeaning or bad-mouthing other celebrities, Frank Lagella impressed with his insider's view of fellow personalities from politics and show business, and did it in a highly impressive and literate prose. One of those hard-to-put-down books that can be read in one sitting or kept in the john for snippets catching."
5,Best price,"I found this Fathead after searching many many sites and stores!The price was perfect and shipping was on time.I would rate this as high as I could!!The Fathead was just as advertised and even though it wasn't available at the store, the web made it possible"
5,Neotech Sax Strap,A must have if you play a large horn! I have two. Made well. All claims are true in my experience. I play a baritone saxophone.
2,"Decent basics, but focus is on Christian church boards.","Base content is OK. However, be aware that this book is geared towards the selection of members for and running a Christian church board. Very frequent biblical references and text such as ""a godly life, Bible knowledge, spiritual maturity and discernment are primary qualifications"" (for serving on a board) undermined the usefulness of this text in preparing a guideline report for the non-religious not-for-profit I work for."
3,A somewhat misleading title,This book is primarily about boards of religious bodies and not particularly useful outside of that arena.
4,a great book,this was a terrific book with lots of beautiful pictures and easy to follow recipes. there was something for everyone from novices to chefs. its great!!
4,good recipes,"unique cookbook, explains some about the culture and has many true Mexican dishes that are yummy."
4,I love this cookbook series!,"This book is beautiful and packed with appealing recipes. The quality of the paper, the vivid photography, and the engaging travel writing combine to make this more than just a book of recipes. It's a book you'll pull out and thumb through while you think about where you want to go in Mexico."
5,Just Get It,"The book is large (10.5x14.5) and is fully illustrated and worth every penny. The illustrations are not step-by-step but are large images that show the finished product. I learned more from studying the final dish images in large format than from all the other Mexican cook books I have, and I have more cookbooks than I need. The recipes cover the simplest to the more complicated. I like the simpler ones. I have many of the best books from other authors, but they are text, text, text. This one makes me want to cook, which I am going to do right now!"
1,"Very, very Dissappointing","I like Susana Palazuelos, I enjoyed her meal at Izote in Mexico City...and have used her recipes, but I have no idea what she was doing for this book.In my opinion, this was done when her vision was still quite immature. My main complaint about her recipes is that they are completely Creole Revisionist... in other words they are done from a very Spanish / Euro perspective... the Herb, Chile & Spice combinations have been extremely simplified & you really do not get to understand & appreciate the true genius of Mexican Cuisine. Its like a Spaniard revised all the recipes.Truly dissappointing.... it should be embarrassing to here that Rick Bayless's books are a bit closer than this one."
4,Just Great,"My daughter loves it and I do too, these are the first original episodes. I love watching them and thinking back to how I watched them when I was a little girl."
1,"Most Promising of All, Don Carlos Buell","There is a factual error in the book. W. B. Carter was the brother of Samuel P. Carter, not the cousin."
2,"Beautiful art, problems with picture quality","I am a fan of Nene Thomas's artwork. Her drawings of fairies, queens, horses, and other fantasy themes are generally highly detailed and textured. Her colors are very rich, whether she's working in watercolor or computer.That said, I was very disappointed with the quality of the art in this book. While it contains images of many of her best peices, the pictures are badly pixelated (grainy) and the colors and brightness uneven. Basically, the book needed much better quality control on the layout and printing side. Unfortunately, since this is an artbook, the graphics quality is critical to the value of the book. I'm sad to say that I got this and it has basically been just taking up space on my shelf because the reproductions were so bad."
1,Bad Image Quality,"Before puchasing this book, I read a couple other reviews that stated how poor some of the image quality was in this book. Well, I assumed they had to be wrong, so I bought the book anyway. Turns out they were right. The image quality was pretty bad, so much so that I returned it."
5,stunning,"There has not been a treasure like this,since howard carter found his tomb.This lady knows how to do it all,exquisite fairies,amazing scenes,pretty horses and fabulous dragons.Add to this her gorgeous fashion flare and unique detail.The result is one of a kind,absolutely stunning artwork.love it!"
5,Great Gift,This was a Christmas gift from my husband to me; I love Nene Thomas's work and this book is amazing! Have to have piece!
1,"Title should be ""Elliott Wave for Dummies","The Symmetry Wave by Michael Gur -I took advange of the slow day today to read the above, I found the book almost totally useless and a waste of time. The title should have been ""Elliott wave for dummies"". I was first attracted to it as I understood that he refuted the elliott wave - His arguments were not only wrong but showed his lack of understanding of even the basics of Elliott. Further, many of the very issues he wrongly condims Elliott for his Symmetry wave suffers from as well. In gereral he is just saying to buy as a market makes higher highs and sell when it makes lower lowes, the book shows little insight and is short and packed w/ full page charts to stuff the pages. After this glowing review if anyone is intrested in the book, and although it is out of print, you now know were to find a copy as THIS BOOK IS FOR SALE..contact me if you are intrested"
2,"Trivial, shallow, really boring","Was expecting something dynamic and subtle - the theme presented a great opportunity, apparently not up to the writer's capabiliities at all. This book is silly and just not worth the read time."
1,This book is a dog --- don't bother -- save your money,Bored and dissapointed --- where do i get my time back ?
3,"Not a great novel, but great if you like the genre","While I adore Ana Marie Cox's irreverent, policy-packed blogs, this novel comes short on delivering the same punches. Cox paints a world of Blackberries, Washington cocktail parties, strategy sessions, and media professionals who spend lifetimes cultivating respectability only to lead private lives of recklessness. If you're a fan of the fast Capitol political machine, the trappings of this world will keep you attentive. If you're not, this novel's weak storyline might not cut it for you."
1,This book is as bad as it gets.,Dont waste your money or time this book is seriously bad. I wonder who got a good Wonking to get this garbage published!
5,Sharply observed satire,"Dog Days reminds us that the ugly side of politics is the most fun one to read about as it exposes all the sex, scheming, and backstabbing that happens during a hotly contested presidential campaign. It follows a young campaign staffer who tries to tamp down two scandals (one professional, one personal) by creating a fictitious one. The plot zips along, and the dialogue, especially that between the main character and her partner-in-crime best friend, positively sparkles. This is a book that is both laugh-out-loud funny and frighteningly insightful about the people who are running the country."
1,dull as a butter knife,"As the blogger ""Wonkette,"" Ana Marie Cox wrote smart, witty screeds as sharp as spears -- unfortunately her first novel is as dull as butter knives.The plot is tired and the prose is narcoleptic. ""The champagne was cold and expensive"" is the first sentence, and that's about as exciting as it gets. ""Dog Days"" is obvious, stale, and almost wholly lacking insight or originality.I'm sure I've read worse, but I can't think of anything at the moment."
2,Baby Jesus,My daughter loves flap books but never picks this one up to read. The illustrations are nice but perhaps not as appealing to a toddler. Text does not instill her curiosity.
4,from all-things-considered to my CD rack,"The third track of this CD, ""on the bottom,"" was used as the in-between stories music on All Things Considered a while back (in 2002). I was enchanted by the 30 second snippet, so I ordered the CD. It's ""engaging ambient"" music, with gorgeous textures and a wide variety of sound. If technicolor can keep up such superb work as this CD, they're inevitably going to get noticed. In genre, I'd place them somewhere between 80's Tangerine Dream and Stereolab (without singing). If you like these guys, I'd also highly recommend checking out Isan, particularly ""Lucky Cat"" and ""Salamander"""
4,Fascinating,"Johnny Marr, Karl Bartos, Bernard Sumner ... what sounds like the who is who in music is indeed a very fine collaborative art. This best of compilation features the highlights of all three Electronic albums - a must have"
4,Lots of Nostalgia,"Especially if you grew up in California's Central Valley, this book has a lot of interesting history and a nostalgic look at some landmarks that may or may not be there any more. The only ""minor"" thing that I wish was different is the size of the book. It's my fault for not looking at the dimensions, but for some reason I was expecting it to be bigger. In any event, I am not sorry I got it, and I am looking forward to Part II, which is Hwy. 99 south of Sacramento. When I was a kid, my dad took us on many trips up and down the State, stopping at some of the touristy places and just sightseeing, and that's what this book recalls. So if you want to take a look back, or if you want to forge your own trail today, this is a good book to start with."
3,Not for a restoration project.,"This book could well be titled "" Bondo and exotic paint application"" or ""painting your chopper"" Where would the chopper world be without bondo? They used to call some custom autos ""lead sleads"" for good reason__more lead body filler than original metal. The jobs is this book are the equivalent__""bondo bikes"".If you want a handbook to help you through restoring and old bike or just redoing your daily ride, look somewhere else."
3,not for sportbikes,"its got a lot of good info, but if your trying to paint a sport bike it's not much of a help"
2,so so book.,"Maybe my expectations were different from most but...I was looking for info on how to paint a tank. I have painted several items in the past and was wanting to read about things like mixing paints (not color, but hardner vs reducer). Was also wanting to learn about is buffing out required? How do you do it? I am using PPG paint and it would have been helpful to hear about different paint. Guess I was expecting something different. There was some useful info though."
1,English subtitles---?,The description of the DVD has it containing English subtitles and dubbed into English.It has neither.I don't understand Spanish so it's not doing me much good.
1,"Crappy Product, do your homework before you waste your money","[...]^^Review of my costa hammerheads.Do you enjoy buying a new set of $200+sunglasses each year with absolutely no customer support to back their product? Then Costa Del Mar Sunglasses are for you!These are worst quality than anything I have seen at Walmart. They oxidize, bend, break, etc all with Costa's lifetime warranty...right? Wrong.Don't take my word for it, google Costa Del mar lifetime warranty and see for yourself."
5,Spirituality Linked to Physics and Explained,An excellent discussion of subjects way over my head but explained so that I can understand.
2,"Good quality, poor colors","I'm a fashion designer, and use colored pencils for all my illustrations. For me, the exact color I want is very important. That's why I spent the extra money to get the set of 40. Even though it looks like a lot of colors, they still don't give me what I want. I find that I need to lay down 4-5 different colors in order to get to what I want, and by then I can't use my colorless blender. There's no good skin colored pencil, the greens are all very yellow-ish, even the browns all have a strange green undertone to them. The reds are all very orange still, and it's very difficult to get a deep dark red color. Besides that frustration, they are better quality pencils that Prismacolor. I felt like every time I sharpened my Prismacolor pencils the led would break. These at least don't do that, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to get another set of Prismacolors just to give me some of the basics that I still need."
5,Simply the best.,Simply the best. How could they cancel such good story craft? It is a sad sad commentary on the film studios to cancel the best Sci Fi ever produced by television.
3,More Nathan,"This was primarily coverage of the fans. I would have appreciated hearing more from the cast and having another movie would have been nice as well. It was okay, but not up to the standards of Firefly."
4,Great fun for Firefly fans,"There is a lot to enjoy on this DVD. The absence of Sean Maher, Summer Glau, and Gina Torres from the interviews was missed, but reports are they were unavailable due to scheduling conflicts, not from a desire to participate. Firefly, like other huge shows, has become part of our cultural heritage, and fans of other big SF shows like Star Wars and Star Trek have embraced this single-season series for truly well-crafted show it was. Fans are interviewed, conventions are visited, cast members interacting with fans and on one-on-one follow ups. It also documents the fan momentum to have the film, Serenity produced.Narrated by Jewel Staite and Adam Baldwin. If you love the series, this is an enjoyable afternoon."
2,Not worth it,"I'm glad it didn't cost very much because I felt let down by the content. I had read that there was a lot of things in the special features, but there wasn't. As a Firefly fanatic, I wanted to see everything there was on the subject, so at least now I won't worry that I've missed anything. As mentioned in another review, it was bittersweet, since it was made during such a hopeful time. They were dreaming of the movie being a huge hit, then it wasn't. It brought me to tears."
5,You have no choice but to buy this DVD,"It made me laugh , it made me cry , it made me mad all over again . And I loved it . It was the worst thing I've ever seen in the whole verse . And you shouldn't buy it unless you like the show Firefly , or the movie Serenity . And you definitely shouldn't buy it unless your a fan or even a Browncoat . I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that I didn't want to become a flan .This review may not make sense until after you watch the film , or unless of course your a flan .So don't think on it any longer , BUT IT"
4,firefly neerrdds.,it was cool but long and had so many ugly sweaty nerds on it that it made me feel like a loser.
2,"By fans, for fans. Boring","I am a big Firefly fan - own the TV series and the movie in virtually every format - so I was excited when I saw a new documentary on the show. Unfortunately, this product doesn't live up to the rest. It's a self-indulgent, self-congratulatory retelling of how the cancellation of the TV show drove the fans to guerrilla marketing techniques to get a feature movie made. But there's very little information actually shared here - it's mostly an adoring review of fandom and Joss Whedon himself - including several original songs praising the series, the creator/director/producer, etc. In the end, I found it to be a complete bore and had to force myself to watch it to the end.If you're part of Firefly fandom, you'll enjoy seeing familiar faces and putting usernames to real names. Everyone else, stay away and watch the series or movie instead - there's nothing for you, here."
4,a good read,"if you ever travelled on the Sagafjord, Vistafjord, or any cruise ship for that matter, you'll enjoy this book. I'm not gay, but many of my friends are, and it opened my mind into some of the emotional issues that are involved in gay relationships. very honest and well written. Well done, Stephen!"
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"This collaboration from Herme/Greenspan offers absolutely nothing new. The recipes are trite and uninspiring. Did you notice that someone already has a copy to offer in the used department? No wonder - this book will only collect dust on your shelf. The ""pretty"" pictures aren't enough to justify the existence of the paper used to print them. This Greenspan ""formula"" cookbook doesn't work - Dorie, you've sold out! In other words, don't buy this book; you'll be sorry. I'm going to use my copy as kindling this winter."
3,Dog Chapel Review,"I expected this book to be like new but in fact it was written in on 2 pages. Although I love the story, I wish I had know the pages were damaged."
5,The Dog Chapel,I often give this book as a gift to those who have lost their pet dogs because it helps to celebrate the dogs life in a postive manner. At the end of the book is a form which you can submit along with a picture of your dog to be placed in the Dog Chapel.
2,Joint Pain,My joints and bones started hurting after using this product. I just read online that high vitamin c causes calcium and mineral depletion which would explain this. I am returning the product to seller.
1,Question,"I ordered the Lypo Spheric Vitamin C and it's got a gel consistency, I add 2 ounces of cold water to the packet and it doesn't dissolve, what am I doing wrong or is this the way its suppose to be, if so it taste horrible."
1,Bad stuff,"I took this, and started throwing up. I was sick for a week. This is good idea but bad product."
1,Doesn't dissolve,"Why make a product designed to be added to cold water when it doesn't dissolve? Even as awful as it tastes I think it might make more sense to just squeeze the packet in your mouth rather than have it stuck in your glass. I'm not sure I understand all of the five star reviews. Maybe I just got a defective shipment. It's a great idea, but this is a lot of money to pay for a product that doesn't dissolve.Making your own seemed like such a hassle, but now I think I'll give it a try. It can't taste any worse than this product."
5,Great stuff!,I love this particular product and would suggest it to everyone! I also use the Anti Oxident pac as well.
4,Great product,"I was looking for a vitamin c product that was easily absorbed and this is the best. I would recommend it to anyone. Wish it cost less, but with this, I guess, you get what you pay for!"
5,Great Product,"This is a great product!Having taken this product, I've not had any major coughs and colds.In fact whenever I feel a cold creeping up, I take one and it goes away quite quickly.The product is not acidic and does not cause any discomfort when taken on an empty stomach.I usually take it with water when I awake every morning; I let it run between my teeth and I have not had sore gums since.Definitely recommend this product!"
4,"Good product, but pricey","I use this product when I'm traveling for convenience. When not traveling, I use a bottled liposomal Vitamin C product which is much cheaper (on a per serving basis)."
2,Didn't work for me,I didn't see notice any major benefits or difference. The taste wasnt bad but it didn't help me get over my cold any faster. Vitamin c tablets were just as effective
1,"Acerola, Camu, Amla, etc are better. Use a natural fruit powder instead.","Negatives :horrible tastehorrible texturedoesn't dissolvebad value for money in my opinion, it is made from corn for g-d's sake ! the raw material couldn't be any cheaperpositives:excellent ideadoesn't cause imbalances, like fake 'vitamin c' doesa good productBut I reccomend you use it with a fruit powder, or not at all, because it may still taste awful.simply find a cold pressed, spray dried, freeze dried, or advertised as raw, camu camu powder, acerola powder, rosehip powder, or Amla powder.They often contain massive amounts of vitamin c in them and without the bad taste.A quick note on camu camu powder. There are 2 versions being sold, a bright pink powder, and a dark brown one.Look for the pink version, it tastes 100 times better and has more vitamin C in it.Avoid the juices, simply for reasons of cost."
1,Would not buy again...,"This product tastes disgusting and doesn't dissolve. I wish the people who gave such wonderful reviews of the product would have mentioned this. It's expensive and a complete waste of money, as I will never be able to willingly drink it again."
1,Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C,"Another over hyped, overpriced synthetic vitamin, it did nothing for me.I had much better results with natural, organic Camu Camu powder."
2,Product has not worked for me,I purchsed two boxes of this product and took them as directed for two weeks...I did not experience any benefit at all...I mainly bought it hoping that it would help with my arthritis pain in my left knee...to no avail
2,I couldn't get past the texture,"I wish I could like this form of Vitamin C. I've been taking a lot to fight a viral infection, and was feeling so bloated from the ascorbic acid. However, I could not get past the slimy, mucous-like texture of the product. Be sure to try some before buying large quantities. I also felt like the price was very expensive."
3,What a stupid product listing,"$29 for HOW MUCH?? Honestly, is it $29 for the two packets in the product picture? How do you expect anyone to make an informed purchase without being able to calculate the price per unit of measure? Get real."
1,Has ALCOHOL!!!,I wanted this product because a friend of mine said it works for her. I usually have trouble with pills so this was ideal for me. That is until I looked at all ingredients on their website on livonlabs.com. It has 12% alcohol. This may be ok for others but not for me since I'm taking a medication that is a no no to alcohol.
4,Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C,Have been taking the Lypo-Spheric vitamin C for about 1 month. Do not know how beneficial it is but I think I have more energy and for some reason my blood pressure has dropped quiet a bit since starting the vitamin. Don't know if taking the C is partly responsible or not. I intend to continue taking Lypo-Spheric C for a while to see if further improvement is noticed.
2,Still Have Upset Stomach,"The big draw of liposomal vitamin C is that you can get high doses without the stomach upset from ""regular"" vitamin C. Well, that hasn't proven to be the case for me. I get the same upset stomach with this as with other vitamin C products. I thought it might be the soy causing it, so I tried Dr. Mercola's brand of liposomal C, which is sunflower lecithin based, and had the same problem. Ester C does the same thing. I really wanted this to work, and have tried it 3 different times weeks and months apart, but got an upset stomach every time. I'm sure it's great for those for whom it works, but don't commit to a large amount of it until you see how you react."
5,Miracle Drug,"If someone else had told me this, then I would not believe them, but since this happened in my body I am a true believer of Lypo Spheric Vitamin C. I had severe pain in my right knee due to cartilage loss, so I tried the Joint Matrix which did a wonderful job, however the pills produced diarrhea, so I had to slack away from taking them. I began taking Vitamin C in November 2011 just to prevent colds and flu, but amazingly I noticed that I could walk without the knee pain. I blend 1 packet in a Fruit Protein Smoothie to drink for breakfast. The use of this product caused my knee pain to disappear completely and bending, walking or exercising no longer hurts. It is expensive, but its worth every cent to be able to enjoy walking again."
5,Awesome product!,"I call this ""taking a booger"" because thats what it feels like when you drink it. I put it in a small glass of O.J. and just swig it down. I have found that as soon as I start ""feeling"" odd, where I think I might be catching something, I take one of these every 4 hours. I have been doing this for years and I have never come down with a cold. It kicks it in the butt every time. This is the best product for your immune system and I highly recommend everyone to keep it on hand!"
4,very good source of vitamin C,I like the vitamin C. the only thing is it doesnt have a taste but that could be a good thing.
2,Did not notice any improvement in health or feel,"I took the Vitamin packet daily per the instructions for 15 days straight. Not only did I not feel any more energetic or healthy I actually developed a fairly serious case of Lichen Planus on my legs, tongue...and somewhere I'd rather not mention! I'm not saying there is a connection, but I've never had this before and it seems suspicious. I'm 33 years old."
4,It's a OK product,"I took 1-2 packets in fruit juice every morning for 2 weeks. Skin rash I had on my feet for 5 years, has been reduced :-) However my face became VERY oily and I had ugly red pimples all over my face for a week :-(... It's oil coated VC so my liver couldn't quite cope that extra fat, I think. I'm still taking this product but only one packet in ever 4 days and I'm more careful not to eat oily food, so it's under control."
1,Worked great.... Then NOT at ALL!,"This pump lasted ONE WEEK! Was pumping clean water- no trash water. Impeller broke as it is most likely made from inferior plastic. I thought I was getting a bargain, as pumps with similar GPH ratings cost considerably more. This is most definitely a case of - you get what you pay for. I would recommend buying this pump if you like throwing your money away and doing things twice. Save yourself the pain and spent a little more for a better pump, as this pump isn't worth the packaging it comes in."
1,He's the One,"I hate this book.I don't like the way that Elizabeth seems to like Salvador more than blue.I mean,they've been through this before,right?Why does Salvador kiss Elizabeth when he knows she really likes Blue,and then confuse her.If Salvador hadn't kissed Elizabeth he might not have been so angry about her not telling him about how she might be moving."
2,It wasn't good enough.,"This is the worst book I've ever read! I mean Damon's all nice and stuff but sometimes the author makes a boring plot. And I thought that the book made it boring because all it talked about Damon about Mrs. Serson, Jessica thinking Damon has a crush on her, Lacey flirting in almost every part of her part of the story. Also, what does Lacey have to do with the Damon-Jessica-Mrs.Serson thing?"
5,Cool book!,"I love Sweet Valley Jr High. I think She Loves Me...Not is great! At first Damon starts to avoid Jessica. Jesica starts getting suspicious although Damon's just busy on the literary magazine. Jessica starts avoiding Damon cos he almost never tells Jessica about his life. How will it end?Damon thinks he hates his mom's boyf, Ben. Find out how he deals with Ben.And Lacey on the other hand, just dumped Gel and Richard Griggs thinks he's the reason. Do you think so?"
5,I LUVED IT!,"I love the couple Jessica + Damon (not to mention Liz + El Salvador)! The plot actually made me cry!Here's the deal: there is definitely not a 'thing' between Damon and Mrs. Serson. She just asked him to join a lil' club because he finally got to express himself.Jessica and Damon kind of like... break up. It's really sad cause they get to argue on the street in front of everyone. Just like a romantic movie... read it. Especially if you luv J+D. As for the other plot of the story, I can't remember... no offense, but I totally hate the couple Salvador + Elizabeth. She deserves better."
4,Excellent product,"Very good for removing scars. I had chicken pox as an adult and needed something to help the scars heal quickly. This product speed up the process and progress is noticeable. At first I felt a burning and very itchy sensation on the applied areas, but it's the initial reaction and after the first couple of days it went away."
3,????,"I've been using this item for the one month now. Not quite sure whether it really works or not, but one thing for sure is that this thing gives you the most irritating itching if you apply it during night time (not a great idea if you're planning to go to sleep right after you apply it). Hopefully it will work out eventually."
1,Cover support bow,This bow is not very rigid and always bends when I try to put my cover on a 20 ft bow rider. The wood is way too flexible and will not support the weight of the cover.
4,Old movies that are great for Saturdy night,"The Swiss Conspiracy was an ok movie, the sound quality wasn't too good and it was a little hard to follow but it is better than movies they make nowa days.Moon Of The Wolf was a great movie the sound quality wasn't that good either, but it kept your attention right until the end, it is the perfect Saturday night movie."
4,Mozart Serenades K361 & K388,"I was mostly looking for a quality performance of the 'Gran Partita' K361. This recording did not dissapoint. The report between musicians is evident in the blending of the tonalities and emotional portrails of the different movements that comes through. I was also delighted with the performance of the 'Nacht Musique' K388. For me, an added bonus as I was not actively looking for this piece."
2,quality has steadily gone downhill,"I'm not sure what happened when the company changed hands, but I used to get about 3 years out of a bag before it even got weak, and I can barely get a season out of these anymore without a soggy hole in it. I haven't changed a thing I do, and my chemicals are always right on...I guess we are kind of locked in to the product unfortunately, if we want our pools cleaned.."
4,Works pretty good,Works pretty good for what it is designed to do. Found that if you pick up large twigs it would rip a little
2,Whatever.,One note. Didn't hold interest. A magazine story at best- not at all a book's worth of material. I swapped mine for CDs.
5,Knows what he is doing,I wish I had discovered this man sooner. He is very good at instructing yoga and helps you on how to mindful during your practice. i definately will purchase more DVD's with him as the instructor.
5,My Favorite Rodney Yee Disc - 5 Fine 20-minute Practices,"The obvious disclaimer in reviewing yoga DVDs is the style of yoga and level of difficulty will vary so widely amongst users.I have 4 of Rodney's discs and my favorite by far is ""A.M. Yoga."" Five very nice vinyassa style practices, all 20-minute each which happens to be perfect for me. I know GAIAM is naturally into marketing and trying to come up with new incarnations of Rodney Yee discs, but frankly I would love another disc EXACTLY like ""A.M. Yoga."" While sequels may not always work in Hollywood, I think it would work with ""A.M. Yoga."" There are MANY other Rodney Yee discs for people who want something else, but GAIAM should consider another discs of Rodney Yee himself filmed in a beautiful setting doing 20-minute vinyassa practices."
4,Great way to vary your workout through the week,These are fairly short workouts that allow you to focus on a different area each day. I bought it as a complement to my beloved AM yoga by Rodney to provide a longer session on mornings when I have a little more time. I found one of the session REALLY boring but I do it anyway in rotation with the others which are pretty good. Rodney doesn't tell you how to modify the positions if you can't get into them though but they are all fairly basic even for a home yogi like me!
2,Too hard and not segmented together,"This DVD does not offer a regular 20-45 minute yoga 'workout'. It is segmented into parts, so you have to go to the menu to obtain different moves. For example, there are backbends, but they are all together, and to get any standing moves you have to go back to the menu and choose it. If you are looking for an all around (floor to standing) workout this is not the DVD for you. Also Rodney is a pretzel and doesn't show any modifications to the moves, and I in general found this DVD very difficult to follow."
5,Love it!,I love this! It's the perfect length to get you up and moving in the morning without seriously compromising your sleep.
3,I liked this dvd.,"I was surprised that it was standing poses, twist,etc and not a variety of poses for each day. Other than that I enjoyed the dvd.It met my needs and expectations"
4,Great Way,"Rodney Yee is the best in my opinion. His gentle and calm manner helps when trying to get centered for your day. The poses are easy to follow and achieve while allowing you to stretch, no pun in tended, to the next challenge. So glad I bought this DVD."
2,Not for me.,"I've been practicing yoga on and off for about five years now, and have used some of Rodney Yee's DVD's before. I just didn't care for this one. I didn't like the Grand Canyon setting, I didn't really like the music, and in my opinion, the stretches and poses were a little intense for a ""right-out-of-bed"" workout. It left me feeling stiff instead of limber and relaxed, and it was more difficult than I thought it would be. This is probably my fault for not going with something labeled BEGINNER or GENTLE POSES, but be ye warned: if you're looking for a gentler, more meditative start to the day, this is probably not for you."
5,don't hesitate to buy this dvd,I had fallen out of yoga practice and was finding it hard to get to a studio for classes because i'm a medical student with a busy schedule and lots of pressure. I got this dvd to do in the mornings between waking up and starting to study- it has been wonderful! I don't feel intimidated by the postures and the guidance/cues are great because you can really work into the poses if you are experienced but shouldn't be intimidated because there is nothing here that I wouldn't share with even my grandparents! I bought a second copy for my mother on her birthday and she loves it (she actually uses it as a way to wind down from work).
5,A Great Start to any day!,"I am a serious yogi for about 20 months now. Rodney Yee DVD's are how I started my home practice and I continue to use his products and expand my yoga practice in the Iyengar method of yoga. I purchased this DVD to help develop a morning practice and have it provide variety. Every practice on the DVD is fantastic for each morning. Since practicing to this about a month ago, I have just felt better each and every day. The practices are not complex or difficult, but provide a great vehicle through which to open your body in different ways. I like how the five different practices are sequenced to start easy and then build to allow you to wake up, so to speak. Then after work I will practice to his Yoga Conditioning for Athletes or Strength Building Yoga. Great for any beginner or intermediate level yogi if you are looking for something to provide a great start to your day and/or add some different variety to your home practice."
4,AM Yoga for Your Week,"I am very happy with this purchase. Although, I am not really a beginner.....I have not been consistent with my yoga practice. I am happy that I now practice yoga for 20 - 30 minutes both morning and night because of this video. It is thorough, easy enough for a beginner but with enough punch for an intermediate to reach goals. Rodney's voice is soothing and his instructions are clear. If you are looking for a full routine, this is not the video to choose. For me with work and time constraints, it became increasingly difficult to fit yoga. With this video, before you know it you are done and off to work. I feel clear in the morning and my breathing is relaxed. My blood pressure is also going down. Win - Win."
3,Very Oddly Organized,"The workout/yoga segments in this DVD are organized in a way that is very odd (and not very good). From the Main Menu, you can choose: Standing Poses OR Twisting poses OR back-bends, etc. Each segment lasts about 20 minutes. To go from one 20-minute segment to another, you have to go back to main menu and select a different set of poses.There is no ""combined workout"" or option to do an integrated workout/session. There are also no segments longer than 20 minutes. So if you want some variety and/or a longer session, this DVD will not really help you. I found this approach to organizing the sessions to be very odd, and not conducive to a well-rounded, seamless morning workout.If I had know this was how they did this DVD, I would not have bought it, and unfortunately, I cannot say I recommend this DVD."
3,missing section,Rodney Yee's A.M. Yoga is a terrific DVD but after my third try at getting an unflawed DVD I'm going to settle for 4 out of 5 of the workouts. The final workout on each of the three DVDs I was sent doesn't play and it's clear that the DVD should be rerecorded.
3,Not What I Expected,"The video is great, don't get me wrong, and I love Rodney Yee. I just wasn't expecting the workouts to be as they are. No mixing it up. It's all one way."
1,extremely basic,"I read the other reviews and find them extremely misleading! This video is for beginners' yoga practice alone. IF YOU NEVER DID YOGA then this is the right video, otherwise you're better off with ANYTHING else. It isn't a workout or a yoga session, its a series of 20mn poses in which the instructor goes over the details for each pose.I guess if you ever did Brian Kest's yoga there is very little to follow up. :("
1,Don't Buy It,"This is a really lame video--it's short, really doesn't count as a workout, and I found it to be a huge waste of money. I'm actually bummed I bought it.Go for another, more strenuous DVD where you actually feel like you worked out after. This won't give you that gratification."
3,enjoyable way to ease into yoga,"I like this video. The 20 minute sequences are just short enough to easily fit into my morning routine and start the day right.They don't tell you that some videos require props - like a block for the hip openers for example.The part I like the least is Rodney Yee's spiel in the beginning. It's distracting: corny, preachy, and poorly lit.In contrast, the yoga itself is filmed beautifully with breathtaking scenery.Overall, happy with the purchase."
1,Rip,"Maybe it's me but watching 8 to 10 postures over and over and over with NO narration is really NOT what I thought I was buying. Criminal that they allow this ""for sale"". Too much trouble to return. My time is worth more."
3,Misleading - not 5 FULL workouts.,I was hoping that it would be 5 complete workouts like AM/PM yoga. Instead divided by type of pose. Does not hit all parts of body.
2,All but the D note,The pitchpipe works great on all notes except the D. I ordered the Guitar one as well and the same problem. Will not order this model again. I would like all notes to be correct
5,Lush and funny,"This book is one of my favorites ever. It is funny and lyrical and although LA Loca grew up in an entirely different atmosphere, she speaks to me as well. Failed relationships, fights with your mom, great (quickly over) relationships, very mundane everyday things, made tragedy and comedy. Not your traditional poetry book. I have fond memories of poetry readings among friends on the DC metro commuting from my boring government job."
2,Dont buy if you have a thick matress,It said it would fit deep pockets but it did not. I forced it and ripped the sheet. Also I have owned much softer sheets.
2,"Decent for the money, but could be better...","I bought the King duvet cover with brown stitching. Duvet cover runs a little big by a couple of inches and it sure does come out wrinkled out of the wash. It's also a little thin and could be softer, but for the price I paid it's decent considering."
2,VERY wrinkly after washing,"For the price, this duvet is a decent buy--only because you can afford to replace it quickly. Problem one: beautiful out of the bag, but after the first wash it is wrinkly beyond a slept-in linen suit. Problem two: because of the piping/seam, getting it clean can be tricky. White cotton fabric like this really needs bleach after a while but that will fade the trim unpleasantly. Probably OK for a guest bed, just not one that would need washing (and ironing-who has time?) regularly."
5,Good,"Does come out wrinkled from the dryer, but these are great if you don't like thick heavy sheets."
5,Not bad...,"First off, I'd like to say that I am by no means a Puff Daddy or should I say P. Diddy fan. In fact, before I heard this, the only song I liked with him was Hate Me Now from Nas' I Am... CD. Even with all this being said though, this song is hot! Its got a nice beat all the way through and for Puff Daddy, the rapping isn't half-bad either. However, I didn't like all of the different mixes on this single. I found most of them to be repetitive and annoying. Overall though, this single is worth the money!"
1,Horrible,my sister has Much Dance 2002 which has a puff daddy song that i liked...i saw this cd for $1 at a cd store so i bougt it....i listened to it once and it was not that great at all..another thing is its a cd single...and those things are just a big waste of money....so DONT buy this cd even if your a puff daddy fan..if you liek puff daddy so much just buy one of his real cd's
4,Sweetty vocals but not the best,"Fetiche have good vocals, she try to be like Eva Ayllon or Cecilia Barraza, but she dissapeared. Infact this CD is one of their best recordings,she have a mixture of afro and creole songs."
4,Culture Counts,Superb text on the importance of relationships in classroom especially for Maori students. Very worthwhile read
2,Not his best,"A friend of mine let me hear his CD of this guy and it was hilarious, so I got this CD but this one is not nearly as funny. Willie is really good but some CDs are better than others."
1,Not Much Here,"The first chapter makes a clear case that being poor sucks. Then the second chapter makes a clear case that being poor sucks. Then the third chapter makes the case that being poor sucks, and finally, the fourth chapter makes the case that being poor sucks. So that's half the book.If you are unsure about what it's like being poor (it sucks) the first half of the book is a must read.The book is heavily researched and well cited. A first rate example of the use of authority to sound deep, profound,and well reasoned, while remaining, at heart, shrill, emotional, and shallow.This effort is really an op-ed that has been stretched into a book for no sensible reason."
1,Ineffective,"This comb was completely ineffective for removing nits and eggs. It did pull out adult lice, but that's the easy part. I am going to go buy one of the metal combs with longer teeth to try to get these things taken care of!!!"
2,Other uses for this comb.,The comb is not being used for what it was made for. I use it for a hobby I have. It leaves just the right fine designs I want on my products. Thank you.
2,Breaks incredibly easy,Trust the other reviews. The tines on this comb snap off with the smallest amount of pressure. Invest in a metal comb instead.
1,Brittle and cheap,"Probably works fine for a single use, but not comfortably. Too sharp and brittle. Go to a pet store for their nylon version for a much better multi-use very fine-toothed comb."
2,Did not hold up,I was very pleased to find I could purchase a lice comb online. I got my order promptly and in good condition. Unfortunately the comb did not last through the first use. It really is not sturdy.
1,useless,"Its a pathetic comb, complete waste of money!! Not at all unbreakable...broke in one use!! of no use. pls return my money o seller now! this product, pls pls dont buy."
2,Broke easily,"I have really long and thick hair. Every time I combed my hair with it a tooth broke. Find a better comb, because this comb was not great."
1,waste,its quality is so poor dat if u'll comb in little unmanaged hair it's teeth will also come out with your hair.its not worth of even a cent.
1,Not worth!,The teeth are too sharp and thin.And they break even at the slightest contact with hair.It is not at all sturdy or handy.
3,Is this prescription-only?,"I found this blog post:[...]It basically says that its a prescription-only toothpaste, should only be used for a short time and can change the colour of your teeth..Is this true or b.s. ?"
2,Not sold on this product,"Product is very expensive and I did not feel any noticable difference after using it, I will not order it again as it is a waste of money. lesson learned.."
4,An Actual Review,I personally really enjoyed this album. I think the artists did a good job at leaving the good country sound to it yet still making it new and different enough from the vocals cut with Carrie Underwood singing.I am a person that likes instrumental music for studying and this album simply fits the bill. The songs are good familiar tunes and not too distracting if you are trying to concentrate on something else.I would highly recommend this album if you like Carrie Underwood and/or if you just like instrumental.
1,Questions for others,"I have a couple of concerns about this book. As a mom who has lost a child to adoption, I am familiar with the ""writing a letter to your child"" right after placement and filling up the pages with words of hope. However, often times, this is not the full scope of the reality of what has happened to the mom, and it is a once done thing, and is frozen in time. It doesn't seem to go into depth of the sense of loss that these women will feel later, how they will be affected negatively by the loss of their child, despite their greatest hopes forced into making this decision through lack of any real options by profit making agencies.I would love to read a book that is about mothers who've lost children in other countries twenty years after placement (or so) to talk about their experience and how it affected them for the rest of their life."
1,The book that doesn't really answer any questions,"I bought the book because I wanted to understand birth mothers decisions' a little more. All I came away with was how they folded under the pressure of someone else telling them to give their children away, and how they found god. I understand the god part-after all, this book was edited by someone who works/worked for a christian maternity home. What I wanted was honesty; I didn't get that from this book. I felt a lot of emotions when I first started reading; when I had finished reading, I just felt anger. It didn't answer any questions for me. Maybe it soothes a-parents to read their stories, but as a KAD, it did nothing for me."
1,How to torture your dog.,"I have a real problem with this woman.There are several times in the tape where she makes the dog she is working with yelp in pain. Then she has the nerve to say: ""Oh, that didn't hurt as much as you are letting on"".I don't think you have to create pain in an animal to the point where they yell in pain, in order to teach them what you want them to do. There are plenty of counter examples of professional trainers who use love and respect to get the animal to behave in a manner the trainer wants, without causing the animal to scream.I hope you will NOT use this tape, nor her methods. Those techniques work, no doubt, but let's get a little more enlighted shall we? Let's not torture the one's we are trying to love."
1,Is this even music?,"I've listened to both symphonies here, and I absolutely LOATHED them. I'm really disappointed--I loved Bernstein's music for ""On The Town"" and ""West Side Story."" There's no melody--it just sounds like orchestral chaos, utterly painful to the ears."
2,lilith vol.3 blows,"I can't believe how much this one sucks. I went to one of the '98 lilith fair tour concerts and just that one was much better than the compilation that appears on this cd. Plus it is only 1 cd what is up with that? last years was much better even if some people don't enjoy all of the singers, there are still some that do. The one I went to had Sinead O'connor in it where is she on the CD? Yet they have Mi'chelle n'degutdfaufuk?!!?!? who is she anyway? I am one unhappy camper. Natalie Merchant too."
2,Sixpence makes this CD none the richer,"Holly and Sarah are great. Many of the artists are edgy and mature. But ""Kiss Me"" by Sixpence is an example of the sappy shallowness that this CD gets stuck in. Two stars is generous. Reissue this without the Sixpence track."
2,Annoying,"I love Sarah McLachlan and love her ""Black & White"", but listening to females for too long can get annoying. Too much sensitivity from these women when only Sarah McLachlan provides a much needed hard edge."
5,The Circle,"Real Country at its best. I hope Erin can bring country music around to what it is supposed to be, REAL!!!! She has a pure, clear, soulful, heartfelt, perfect pitch voice. Just sit back and listen and enjoy."
1,"Was it a play, or was it a display?","""...AND PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT SORT OF THINGS. NOT OUT IN THE OPEN..."" Caius. I would add: especially not in BALLET, CLASSICAL BALLET!""...SO THAT THE DREAM OF SPARTACUS MAY COME TO BE IN OUR OWN TIME."" Howard Fast. I did not see a hero there - sex was a main part of the show, first, and second, the dancer Yuri Klevtsof barely could perform such a part, as Spartacus part - dropping his partner and not bringing a hero to audience. JUST TECHNIQUES, if you want to. Rich but POOR."
2,Arrogance of author turns off this reader,Having trouble getting through this book. Author is extremely arrogant with attitude to spare. Makes me not want to bother if I have to constantly hear how superior she feels she is to everyone else on the planet.
5,Minería Espiritual,"En este práctico y maravilloso libro dedicado a la Ascensión se hace una comparación sumamente práctica entre los buscadores de la Verdad y los férreos mineros, en cuanto a la constancia que se necesita para llegar al ""logro"" y de la necesidad del uso de herramientas tan vitales como los son La Llama Violeta transmutadora y el Manto Electrónico de Luz, las cuales nos permiten eficazmente construir ese tunel que nos conecta con ""La Presencia """
2,Terrible,"My gf at the time was a HUGE NBC fan so she wanted this game for her game boy. All she ever did was complain about it, so I'm assuming it was not very fun and not very good. Although what can you expect from an old GBA game."
5,Tim Burton's Ninghmare before Christmas: The Pumpkin King,"I bought this for my 15 year lod neice for Christmas and although I have not played the game, I can honestly tell you that after she recieved it, she immediately put it into her game boy and has not put it down since and it is now mid January."
1,a disappointment,"My daughter is a huge Nightmare/Tim Burton fan, and I was so excited to get this for her as a birthday present. She was excited too, until she played it. After that first day, I haven't seen it in her gameboy since. What a disappointment."
3,Vicious Dogs,"The book arrived in the condition listed and the book was interested reading. I DO have a problem with the entry on the American Bulldog, it was the SHORTEST write-up and that is MY sole purpose for purchasing the book, more information about the American Bulldog. I also think that TOO much credit for toughness is given to the pitbull, Semencic sings the praises as if this is THE toughest dog in the world and canNOT be defeated, (I KNOW dog fighting is illegal)."
2,intersting,"I find this book interesting,nice pictures too,but there are a few dogbreeds missing.the boerboel,the cane corso,the ovcharkatype dogs,the hovawart,ca de bou,ca de bestiar etc."
3,Can Cause Nausea,"This tea is pleasant enough tasting tea. Unfortunately, before I drank it, I was not aware that nausea is one of the main side effects of valerain, which is the active ingredient in this tea. I drank it on an empty stomach in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep. About 30 minutes after drinking it, I started experiencing nausea and reflux. A quick web search revealed that some people react to valerian with dizziness, headaches and nausea. I guess that I'm one of those people.Oops. Needless to say, this tea did not help me sleep at all."
1,*boos*,"The tea didn't make me drowsy in the slightest and tasted nasty. I've barely had tea in my life, so I checked to make sure I was doing it right the second time, including adding a second bag of tea to see if I just had low sensitivity, but still nothing happened, and it just tasted nastier. Judging by the other reviews, I guess I'm unlucky?"
3,Great Product/Poor Service,"I happen to know this is a good product because I've used it before. However, it has taken longer than the estimated delivery time for it to arrive. (And this is with Amazon Prime!!!)Further, whenever I enter the tracking number, I've gotten the following message--(for the past five days!!!)Your item was processed and left our SPRINGFIELD, MA 01152 facility on August 05, 2006. Information, if available, is updated every evening. Please check again later. It should not take five days for ANYTHING to get from Springfield, MA to Southern Maine.This was my first experience using Amazon Grocery, and I must say it was not a good one. There should be reviews of the services they provide--for which they ARE responsible--and not the products they distribute for which they can take no real credit."
2,"yum, but bad side effects","alright i'm sure from the other reviews you know it tastes awesome, however the key ingredient in a hormone called melatonin and that can cause depression and drowsiness the next day, i've found that i'll be depressed for as long as 3 days (and it's a long bad 3 days, really) i also have trouble sleeping without it, so i might say it's a bit addictive, don't use regularly and consider some of the side effects, this hormone was banned in canada"
5,Sleepy Time Extra is excellent,"My wife has trouble sleeping and used to take Tylenol and a glass of wine.... NOT a good combination. I was really happy when she found that this ""Sleepytime Extra"" helps her sleep just as well! It has none of the side effects of other sleep aids."
4,It works,This stuff really works and tastes so much better than just plain valerian (ugh!). I highly recommend trying it before trying something strong and chemical (and scary) like Ambien.
5,Excellent Product,"This is an excellent product. The taste of it, because of the valerian, may take some getting used to, but a little bit of honey and some quiet relaxing, and this tea will put you right to sleep."
3,nightmare,"I drank this tea for the first time last night and it did put me straight to sleep. Unfortunately, I slept terribly. I had anxiety nightmares all night long to the point where I woke up at 2.15 am with fear and adrenaline rushing through my arms and legs so badly that they were actually hurting. Went back to sleep and it happened again. Finally got up at 4.30 just to make it stop. Was shaky all morning. I've never had this happen before and I'm not taking any medication other than stuff for my asthma. Can't help but relate it the tea though I will try it again tonight to see if happens again. If so, that will be the end of the tea for me."
3,Sleep>,"I was disappointed by this tea. I thought that since it contains Valerian, it would help me go to sleep, but it did bit. A good cup of chamomile tea will do as good as this one."
2,Bad reaction to valerian,"I love regular Sleepytime tea, but I had a bad experience with Sleepytime Extra, I assume because of the valerian. The tea did not help me sleep at all. Then in the morning, I couldn't stand without fainting and had a horrible headache. I had to sleep off the effects for several hours. I tend to be prone to fainting and have bad reactions to drugs with psychological effects, so my reaction is probably unusual. However, I would recommend reading up on valerian before trying this tea.On the plus side, it tasted fine, though different from regular Sleepytime."
2,not the same,"I agree with the reviewer Vasquez. It is my experience that Sleepytime Extra is not the same. To me it is a puny, pale shadow of it's former perfect self.Sadly, the question is why?"
2,"Ok, I guess","Didn't do anything for me except give my heartburn. Gave it to some friends, they love love it."
2,sleepy time with valerian extra,"I used to buy this products in groceries and pharmacies and I gave it to my mother and she used to fall asleep minutes later and after I gave to her for a couple of days on a row she used to sleep a lot during the day too (she suffers from insomnia). It is very difficult to find it in the stores now (the one with valerian) that is why I bought it from amazon, but I do not what happened but this one doesn't have the same effect on my mother, she still doesn't sleep and I have to give her the sleeping pills (they do not help that much either)."
4,Insomnia sucks. This tea helps.,"Will Sleepytime tea cure my inability to sleep? No. Is it a valued part of my get-sleepy-ASAP regimen? YES. I actually use the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea maker to brew this into perfect iced tea. Smooth, calming."
4,Christian Self Help,"Fr. Papineau offers some insightful approaches to dealing with very real and yet confounding human difficulties. No one likes change. Using simple examples from anthropology and real human situations, the author shows us why change is difficult. At the same time, he offers some simple ways to overcome these difficulties and get through the painful aspects of change.Especially helpful were the chapters that dealt with the ""how to"" of forgiving others, and the reflections on ""depression."" Fr. Papineau looks at how conflicts and hurtful situations are often the result of illusions and allowing ourselves to be ""set up."" He also helps us to see that ""depression"" is our psyche's way of telling us that we need to make a change.The book is especially helpful for people who are in transition: newly-married or divorced people, people who have just experienced a job change, novices, graduates, empty-nesters, newly retired folks, etc."
2,incorrect description,this was the wrong set which explained why it was so extremely cheap. The set didn't even include what was in the picture. I did give 2 stars though for the quick refund.
5,Mamie Van Doren Is Fabulous With Ray Anthony !,In 1957 Mamie Van Doren was promoting her current film Untamed Youth and made an appearance on Ray Anthony's show.She belted out a wild version of Deed I Do and it is not to be missed if you are a Mamie Van Doren fan ! Otherwise the show is entertaining but pretty campy.I loved getting the chance to see Mamie Van Doren in a rare television variety show appearance.
2,Cheap casing,"Although the USB flash drive works fine as an external data storage (not using it as ready boost), it's casing is made out of cheap plastic and glued together so that it came apart when I first touched it. I had to reapply glue to the casing in order to maintain it in place. I have no issues with the storage system itself but I have to be very carefull when inserting this piece to a usb port. Two stars because this drive is supposed to be portable, but disassembles at the slightest touch."
4,On Patriot Sig. 8GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive,"The item itself is very satisfactory. It has a lot more space than my other USB's. Only thing is, it does not come with a keyring (make your own!) and would be pretty easy to lose. I dislike the insanely high shipping rate though..."
5,works well for xbox 360,it definitely works well for the xbox 360 haven't tried outside of that so take it or leave it if you want a way to get your profile from one xbox to another this is what you want
4,Perfect for the price,"While it's true that this isn't the fastest flash drive by a significant margin, it's ideal if you just need to transfer files from one machine to the other in the easiest and cheapest manner. 4GB for six bucks is a steal compared to models in retail stores that sell for 8-10 times as much. It works with no pre-installed software on both Windows Vista and Windows 7. The build quality isn't much to get excited about but it's a great 'no frills' solution."
5,"Simple product, simple uses, fair price","At the time I bought this flash drive it was about $5 (2GB). I was looking for an inexpensive flash drive to back up some files of mine, and this did the trick. My favorite part about this flash drive is that it is NOT loaded with anything...no bloatware, no software trials, nothing! I've had flash drives that auto-boot some trial software and that can be infuriating.Speeds are nowhere near speeds you can achieve if you just spend a few extra bucks, but for simple uses (and being cheap) I highly recommend this flash drive."
2,"Cheap, mediocre performance.","I received this drive free when it was bundled with another Patriot product.The plastic exterior is bit cheap feeling, but does the job. Unfortunately the cap cannot mount on the back of the drive.I ran the benchmarks below using Ubuntu 10.10, USB 2.0 port, on a clean, formatted FAT32 drive:$ sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sdb1 && sudo dd count=1k bs=1M if=/dev/zero of=/media/8bdb3b70-083d-4dcb-a6b3-dc685004056e/test.img/dev/sdb1:Timing cached reads: 2118 MB in 1.99 seconds = 1061.80 MB/secTiming buffered disk reads: 28 MB in 3.05 seconds = 9.19 MB/sec1024+0 records in1024+0 records out1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 235.332 s, 4.6 MB/sRead/write speeds ~9 MB/s and ~5 MB/s is pretty poor performance for this day and age. I have $20 flash drives from two years ago that run circles around this drive."
5,Works Fine but FAT32 Formatted,"This flash drive seems to work just fine, and was less price than most other brands. My only problem was that the drive is formatted in FAT32. So I just reformatted it in NTFS to accomodate files larger than 4GB (Just in case, since I plan to backup vacation videos on it while traveling.) I have not had it long, so I cannot say how durable it is. So far, so good!"
1,:(,"Even though the price is right, it's not worth the inconvenience. Removing the cap is tricky and it is difficult to insert into USB socket. Save your money!"
3,Minor Issue,"This is a typical flash drive that works fine. I am a teacher and I ordered 30 of them for my students. The price was right. The issue I have with them is that they have a VERY small hole in which to attach a lanyard, keyring or other connecting unit."
2,S l o w .......,"Purchased several of these for business and personal use for use on all types of platforms (Win, OSX, Linux, etc.) and speed is very sub-par. Regardless of platform or format, speeds are abysmal. Bought these based on the reviews of others regarding speed and I'm sorry to say they were way off. Throughput on large files (e.g. 9GB MKV) maxes out at 4MB/s and read speeds are equal - even using TeraCopy on Windows the speeds are no better. Keep in mind this is real-world file transfer speeds, not the results of a synthetic benchmark.Hope this review helps someone out - if you need a general purpose USB drive this would be fine, but don't expect stellar performance."
4,A good USB for a good price,"This is a good USB flash drive. It is small,flat, and works fine. Nothing strange or unusual, other than the matte-metalic silver color, which I like."
2,1 hit wonder,"The next day I received this 8gig usb drive I took it to work to copy some data. About 1 gig worth of files copied and it goes in to read only mode and I can not write to the drive. So far no luck ""unlocking"" the drive and why it decided to lock its self in a middle of a copy operation is beyond me. Not impressed with this drive, it was cheap enough, but still should work more than 1 day."
2,It erased all my files and the name I gave it due to me naming it.,"After using it for a few days, I then decided to give it a name. Either that same day or the next day, all my files somehow were erased and the name I gave it too was erased. So, I named it again and have been using it (just for backups) regularly and it's been working perfectly all these months later."
4,Good,This USB flash drive is the same as any other one that you will find. The missing 1 star is because I chose a blue color and I got a white one. I would definately buy again.
4,So Cute!!!,"This little book is the cutest marriage therapy book I've ever read, and being a Romance Expert I've read a lot. It gives me a great feeling when I read it. It's all good information that should be taken to heart."
1,Item not as described,"I purchased this particular battery for my Fujifilm X100 camera rather than any of the other NP-95 equivalents out there on the market because the technical description here on Amazon noted that it was 1800mAh -- the same as the OEM battery. What I received in the mail from ""Best Stop Warehouse"", who actually sent the battery to me, was the typical 1350mAh knockoff. An email to Best Stop Warehouse upon receipt of the product was never responded to, despite their claim to answer all emails within 24 hours."
5,comprehensive explanation of the software of the mind,"After reading 4 recent books on mahamudra by this precious and generous author, I believe that this is the most complete and therefore the most useful. you could spend years practicing the information in this instruction and profit greatly."
3,"Good enough for school, maybe not leisure","I had to read this for an English Lit class, and it was great. I enjoyed it so much that semester that I didn't even sell it back! But I haven't read it since, so maybe it isn't that great unless you are forced to read it. As required reading, it really is one of the best and most interesting book of poems you'll likely read. For leisure.. maybe not.Oh! By the way, the lesbian undertones were a great and interesting surprise! And also made writing about feminist theory REALLY EASY."
2,Booooooo-ring!,"Adrienne Rich has to be the most over-rated poet in history. Her work would be completely forgotten if it was judged as poetry, but because she has been adopted as the ideological idol of PC fanatics everywhere, she has become an untouchable icon of the present. Rich is best compared, intellectually, to the literary drudges of Soviet Russia, who extolled the glories of the people for the Communist Party. The diffrence, obviously, is that Rich is not embraced by the State, but by the buddy system that is academic feminism. This volume, complete with the breathless worship -- oh, sorry, critical scholarly attention -- of the editor, is a very fine presentation of what is, for all practical purposes, the work of a transient figure whose prominence is entirely dependent on the current PC state of the American academic establishment. If you wandered to this book because it claims to be poetry, why not skip it and try someone with some soul adn some real poetic talent?"
1,Diving into the crap,"These poems might as well have been the dictated sounds of gas bubbles coming up through the innards of a body dragged out of a lake. Rich is bitter, stale like old medical encyclopedias uprooted from their post in grandma's attic. If that's what you're into, have at it. Me, I'm not into mothball verse."
2,Not original artists,I probably did not read the descriptin correctly but these songs are not done by the origianl artists.
2,Book Review,"Though I read the whole thing, I never really got much out of it. The plot doesn't seem to go very far and I thought it was mostly unhappy."
3,A trip to Arles,I did not find this book to be very engaging. I have traveled to Arles and the surrounding area. Reading about the place where I enjoyed a wonderful vacation with my daughter was fun.
4,discovering a new writer,The novellas here are fortified by a lengthy review of Elkin's life. The Van Gogh's Room at Arles is breathtakingly funny and touching at the same time. I'm so happy to have discovered this author.
1,Don't Buy,"Information was there, but in outline format. Hard to read. Hard to follow. There are a lot better books out there. The Saunder's book was a TON better."
2,Lasts a whole 3 weeks,"TerribleFor about 3 weeks it was the greatest pizza cutter I've ever had. No contest.AFTER THAT; the support screw striped away, causing the cutter plate to rock.then the Teflon began to peel away; first slowly, then in large chunks.Now; it's totally worthless. It's not even nickeled stainless, so there's not even a scrap recovery for it.Junk all the way around. What a waste of money."
5,Terri's Best Album!,This album is what makes beach music great. It is the kind of music that touches your soul and makes you feel good. And Terri has the voice of an angel. This is the best album by any female vocalist in the industry. Without this in your collection you are not a beach music fan. A must have!
5,In a word this CD is wonderful!,"Terri is one of the best female vocalist of our times. This CD is just another example of her awsome talent. Terri thanks for your voice, heart, soul and music. It don't get no better than this!"
1,CAUTION,"Beware when buying from a third party.If there is a problem you are on your own..!!!!I was sent the wrong product I returned it immediately and it was over a month before I got a refund.I never was fully reimbursed for the return delivery...!Amazon is getting a bad reputation for not looking after their customers when there are problems.....Check this out online with consumer sites.....Shame on you Amazon.....never again.There are too many other places to shop that know how to treat customers, why waste your time and money!"
2,it is not capable of much,I unwrapped the contraption and began working with it. It produced many noises. It then caused my computer to crash. i could no longer store anything with it. Tech support said it was due to a faulty cord. I then replaced my computer now it works fine.
2,Provided software has bugs,"I find the unit itself to be easy to connect, and I think I backed up my entire hard drive in record time. Problem is, I made the mistake of also installing the provided software, and it locked up my computer...it's now in the shop having the conflicts resolved. I found the instructions to be of little use...very confusing and contradictory. Be VERY CAREFUL about using the provided software."
4,dependable - but noisy,"Seagate hard drives are dependable and solid. The Backup express software was easy to install and has been nudging me to back up my laptop almost every day (annoying, but a good thing). Not a bad choice for the price."
3,So far good:),"It has been 20+ days now and it is working fine. I have heard problems with other companies' Hard Drives , so finally decided to go with seagate which is working fine.The only thing that needs to be taken care is the sound is makes...which sometimes seems irritating--otherwise it goes good....Also, sometimes when u try to shut it down through ""Safely Remove hardware"", it says file is in use (though that's not true)---Data transfer rate is OK.But Seeing the reviews of other hard drives, I would still recommend this one--Which seems better among others.Hope this helps,Ankush"
1,Crashed After 30 Days,"Used it for a month, it worked great and then dumped all my PC files on it so I could upgrade my PC. After upgrading I reconnected the External drive to restore my files and it never worked again. USB ports are fine as my camera and jukebox player are still recognized. Sent my HD out for Data Recovery and was told the heads crashed and they could not guarantee me how many files could be recoverd. The cost is anywhere from 800 to 2,000. This is the only time in 20 some years i've expierenced a hard disk crash. Seagate only warrants their externals for one year and Data Recovery is not warranted at all. So don't be like me and put 100% confidence in a HD without additional backups."
3,"Good... not great. Forget about ""one-touch"" backups!","First, our office has tons of Seagate drives so I can say with confidence that they make a GREAT product. Usually they also do an excellent job supporting it... Except for this one. Apparently (and it took me 3 weeks to discover it) this drive is one of those ""hybrid"" products where the actual drive was made by Seagate but all of the software to run it was made by CMS. What that means for the user is that in order to use all of the ""One Touch"" button features that this drive touts, you need to go buy software from CMS for and EXTRA $69.95. It took me 3 weeks of fighting with Seagate to get it for free.Morale of the story... this is an EXCELLENT external drive, as long as you treat it like a regular drive. If you want to use any of the ""extra"" value-add features that they advertise be prepared for an uphill battle. It is quiet, quick and easy to use as a normal drive but don't expect anything fancy out of it."
5,Saved my life,"Plain and simple. I started backing up my CPU to this lovely little peripheral and then the CPU fried (not because of the hard-drive, of course). Thanks to my 200 GB hard drive, my data was spared a gruseome death and it has proved itself worth every penny.Speed is great. Installation painfully simple (plug & play on WinXP). I'm now using it to backup as well as store my audio files for ProTool! This thing rocks. Thank you, Seagate!"
4,Performs quite well. But some additional features would make it better.,"This Seagate external drive was very easy to install (truly plug and play) and performs very well - quiet, good transfer rate and no failures or data errors even under heavy use.But there are a couple of features that might have made it even better. The drive doesn't seem to allow you to setup a hibernation or power save mode. Also if you plan on switching it off manually, any automatic backup jobs to this drive will not work until you switch on the drive manually. It would have been great if they could have allowed it to be woken up by the computer when needed. Not a big deal. Just a nice to have.Overall, a great product!!!"
4,Works as it should,"This hard drive backed up my entire My Documents directory without any trouble. It took a good 2 hours for all the data to transfer for the first time. I thought that was a bit slow. However, since then, it only takes about 5 minutes to back up."
5,Good tool for video editing,"I have used these devices for two years now as part of my video editing arsenal for amateur/semi-pro video productions. I own 5 and adopted them as solutions for my work team (software development) to back up developers notebooks as well. I have only one failure to report, when one was knocked from a table while operating. It is useful to note that Seagate cautions against moving the drives while ""ON"", but this warning was not very prominent. The drives seem to be very fragile in this state. On the other hand, they have survived a similar fall while unplugged, much to my delight."
4,DHL shipping has issues.,"Before I tear into DHL allow me to say that Amazon.com makes living in Snakebelly rural America a whole lot more enjoyable. Also I have a 160 G Seagate and it works fine. I got this new one for a limited time frame Video project I'm working on. When I order from Amazon my experience is that the item comes quickly.Enter DHL. (Cue the music) My much needed Seagate External Hard Drive for the last few days has been sitting somewhere in this small town and labeled ""Undeliverable."" Now I work at home so undeliverable must mean that either their delivery van is out of gas or they can't find their driver. This is consistent with DHL. If a vender told me up front they were using DHL, I'd go somewhere else. Two big thumbs down for DHL."
3,Zero star for the backup software!,"The drive is okay, even though the transformer makes low noise when plug into the power outlet. I had it exchanged, but the second one has the same problem. But the Bounceback backup software that comes with it is a piece of junk! It does not have a restore function. This means you would have to manually copy and paste to restore your files."
4,"Happy With Seagate, I Think","My 200GB Seagate USB2/Firewire External HD arrived without delay and was easy to set up. Unfortunately, the automatic backup software does not work with Mac OS 10.4, only earlier OS 10s. A minor shortcoming. It is a quiet HD, and I was able to quickly transfer my computer's contents to it, including my Itunes library. The cord is a little stiff, and takes some wrestling to get it to lay down where I want it, an odd, unnecessary shortcoming it would seem. With Seagate's $30 rebate, the price was right. Though it came highly recommended, I can't say more about the intrinsic quality of the HD because I've had it too short a time. I am taking a chance on giving it 4 stars. If it's still running fine and reliably in 2-3 years, I'll give it 5 stars."
3,BEWARE,"This drive will not work on a hub! You need to have a direct cpu port.Also the software is BounceBack Express and does not give you a recovery backup. For that you need to pop for about $60.00 more, even though their web page misleads you into thinking a bootable backup is part of Express.Also, please look to see what is installed. There is no icon put on the desktop for ""Settings"" which is the real program. If you move from one machine to another and use a ""one button"" backup you will lose all your prior backup."
4,Seagate Technology 200 GB USB 2.0 and FireWire External Driv,Easy setup with my Windows XP desktop and about 4hrs for the inital backup of 50GB of data using USB.The bundled backup software seems to work well allowing you a variety of backup options. After the inital backup it runs incrementals and seems to make a sppedy job of it.The 200GB is plenty of additional space for photos or video.Much better than my previous Maxtor drive which expired after only 12 months use.
4,"Workable, but a bit buggy","The unit was very easy to install and is very quiet. The upload/download throughput is fast enough for video editing. The backup utility nearly works as advertised (it seems to hang every so often). In fact the only issue I've had is a constant (every 30 minutes) and annoying activation of the drive. It seems to randomly run, without any perceptable reason."
1,Seagate External Hard Drive,"Do not buy Seagate External Hard Drives. It worked great initially so backed up my files. On buying a new computer I attempted to reload files I had backed up and the Seagate drive was dead. Warranty replacement is not satisfactory either as the replacement drive is inferior in quality to drive returned. I have not backed up on the replacement drive but do not expect it to work any different than the original drive purchased. However, at the present time the computer does recognize the replacement drive, but for how long? Very unreliable product for the price."
2,I got a lemon!,"Just 2 months out of manufacturing warranty the drive went dead on me..If you are looking for something that last at least more than the mtbf, don't buy this drive .."
1,External Drive is Old Technology that does not spin-down,"When not is use, or when the computer is off, the drive does not spin (shut) down, which it should do as it does in later models, but keeps going on and on like the Energizer Bunny."
1,Complete Garbage,"This drive lasted 1 day for me. Then when I unplugged it from one computer and tried to hook it up to another it wouldnt show up in Windows anymore. I tried everything - no dice. It just didnt work anymore. And it wasnt a Windows problem, I tried multiple computers to no effect.On the positive side Circuit City was really cool about taking it back and giving me a refund so I could get a good drive."
2,Do yourself a favor,"Backup up your files on DVD or even online storage systems, or some other form of backup. I did all the research, I narrowed the list of potential hard drives to two manufacturers ...Seagate and Western Digitial, they were both the two most often manufacturers reviewed as miles ahead of the competition.So guess what, I bought two backup hard drives from each company, stored the same info on both in case one failed. And guess what they both have failed within the first four months and within the same time frame. That means photos I've taken, music I've recorded and countless other files are gone forever. gone.Thanks alot. What a waste of money. I don't want a replacement I want my files!"
2,It crashed on me!,"This drive crashed on me within 1 year of purchasing it. Although, I will get it replaced by the manufacturer (free of charge), it is still a major hassle trying to recover the inaccessible data that resides on this disk."
3,Good sturdy back-up drive,"Ok So This drive basically has been good to me, it was easy to install. Runs fast with a high end processor and using USB 2.0. I can access my data quite easily and have not had an issue with losing anything(yet)."
2,I'm not impressed,"The first drive was dead on arrival. After hanging out on tech support for 30 minutes Seagate agreed to ship a replacement right away, but wanted me to pay $25 for the service (or I could wait 2 weeks until they received my dead one and then sent a replacement). Fortunately they decided to waived the fee. The second drive came, but couldn't be recognized by either a Win 2000 system or XP system. I had to install their drive utility to prep the drive, and then, finally, the drive was usuable. Not exactly plug and play. One other thing -- the drive is about 185 GB, not 200GB. Apparently at Seagate 1 GB is 1000 MB, not 1024 MB. I guess at Seagate, 11 inches is a foot and 15oz makes a pint."
3,Slower than Maxtor One Touch - Didn't work with Ghost,"I just returned the Seagate drive I ordered. It attached to my Linksys NSLU2 network link fine, but was very slow compared to my older Maxtor external drive. Also, I was unable to image to it using either Norton Ghost 10 or Acronis True Image 9. I tried hooking directly to USB 2 port and it was still rather slow and kind of noisy. I'm returning it and getting a second Maxtor drive."
4,Great way to expand your memory,"I have had this external drive for about a week now, and I pushed this thing pretty far, and it works great. I originally bought it to increase my laptop memory which was 30GB. But I guess going to 200GB was a bit much, however I'm finding more and more stuff to keep on that drive. I have not tested the drive to see if it is compatable with Suse Linux yet, but I am hopefull. The one great thing about this drive is that it does not overheat at all, the drive itself is silent but that is this clicking sound when I have it store my files. Overall it is a great buy!"
1,Dell XPS410 computer + Bounceback software Incompatibility,"The combination of a new Dell XPS410 system and the Seagate 200 GB USB 2.0 works well UNLESS you choose to install the CMS Bounceback software included with the Seagate Drive. This product allows for automatic data backup but may render the computer system inoperable due to an apparent driver conflict. The result is the Blue Screen of Death. Possible fixes are available; however, I had to perform a system restore to an earlier point, prior to the software installation to recover computer functionality. This appears to be an Intel/Dell problem and a serious one. So the drive part of the product works fine but installing the accompanying software can result in a very bad day. You can use Google to find out more and possible fixes."
2,Lost data,"Mine also crashed, all data lost. I was sent a replacement. The new drive is working but there is a loose part inside that is rattling around when I pick the unit up. I'm now using it as a second backup just in case. I'm burning DVD's of my most important files."
5,Intrigue and suspense!,"Newcomer, Martha Morning Todd's first mystery book is a keeper! ""Losing Hope"" held me captive from page one, with its look into a sinister foreign underground right in our own backyard, and its exotic settings. I'm eager for the sequel. Ms. Todd is definitely an author to keep an eye on!"
3,Pretty handy ear piece,Good value for the money. I sometimes struggle with static if my phone is in my pants pocket. Other than that I am pleased.
1,Failed Product,"Like so many others before me, I took a chance on what seemed to be a well built product (scala600). I had bought this as a replacement to my Motorola bluetooth headset that had gone through the wash in a shirt pocket. I thought surely it would fail. Tip: let electronics thoroughly dry out before plugging in for charging or operating. Sometimes this may take a week. You still have a chance at reviving if done properly. The Motorola (H700C) is still working. You get what you pay for!So I ordered a cheap replacement hoping I would get a good one. I didn't. This unit didn't even take a charge. The indicator light would come on briefly red and then go off. Amazon has such a great return policy, I returned it immediately for a refund. That's why I stick with Amazon. Ordering products through Amazon and other vendors is another review. They usually are not as good."
4,The way Bluetooth should be!,"Simple, clear, versatile, easy to use, comfortable to wear - these are just a few things that I can say about this product. When CompUSA closed all of their retail stores, we had over 300 of these in stock. I wondered why people swarmed to gobble them up by name and I had not heard of these that much. When I saw the price that Amazon was offering for this - who could pass that up?My only beef with it is the tinny sound quality - it's clean and crisp, but no definition. But what can I ask for more than what I've already stated? Not much else...it's great - a great value - and the only phones that have some issues are some Samsung phones, but I haven't found which ones yet as I've synced up with several with no problems at all.As they'd say on Wall Street - BUY! BUY! BUY!!!!!!!"
1,Headset will not charge...and unresponsive customer service from Cardo,"Similar to other people's experience, I got a defective headset that would not charge. I emailed the manufacturer's (Cardo Systems) customer service which did not bother to respond. It's not worth the time to try to use this headset; much better to spend $5 more and get something that actually works."
2,Unimpressive follow-up,"I bought one of these because my trusty Scala 500 had finally given up the ghost after serving me well and faithfully for a couple of years. Unfortunately, my experience with the 600 wasn't nearly as good. First thing I noticed when I took it out of its box was just how thin and fragile that ear loop is. And, sure enough, it broke 2 weeks in. The second included ear loop broke not long after that. And my attempts to communicate with Cardo about the problem and to get replacement ear loops were met with nothing but silence. Let's face it - that's just about the textbook definition of bad customer service. I'd stay away from the 600 but if you can find a 500 for a reasonable price...I might still go for another one of those."
3,"decent, but...","I bought the Cardo Scala 600 initially for use while driving and figured that I would also try to use it for IM audio chats. The sound quality is fair when there is no background noise. However, because of the way the earpiece is sized, none of the ambient noise (traffic, radios, passersby, etc.) is kept out. So, as a hands-free cell phone solution, it doesn't really make the cut.When I paired the headset with my MacBook, the audio I got using it with iChat was fair. The catch was that I could not be more than 15 feet from the computer before the static rose to such a point that the other party was completely inaudible.The other little problem was that the manual contained no instructions on how to use the headset, only how to set it up. Web site just linked to a pdf of the same manual.I realize that for under thirty dollars, this was not going to be a top of the line headset.Still, definitely fell short of my expectations."
1,Not Worth the Trouble,"The Bluetooth headset would not charge and I never got it working. The manual says that it might take up to a minute to start charging. A note included in the package said it might take up to 2 hours. That's just ridiculous. After repeated attempts to charge the headset, I gave up and returned it without a problem. Not worth the trouble."
1,Too much noise,"While driving ( windows up ) people complained that there was so much noise they couldn't here me. So , I returned for a replacement assuming it was defective. Same complaints with the replacement. Apparently it just doesn't cut it unless you are in a still room . I use it while driving 90% of the time and that's when people tell me to please use my handset cause the noise is unbearable."
2,"You get what you pay for. Snap, crackle, pop.","This earpiece works, holds a charge(long talk time), fairly easy to pair with your phone. But... people say I sound like I'm in an echho chamber and it crackles when I'm listening to people. But, then again it was $20.So to sum up... Cheap.Long talk time.Easy to use.Bad reception.(good enough to talk while driving)"
3,Fairly good for the price,"The Cardo Scala 600 is very lightweight and comfortable. The ear loop bends so that you can form it to your ear for a more secure feel. This Cardo model does not have an ear bud, which I actually prefer. The sound/voice quality has a little bit of an echo. The function and volume buttons are easy to use. The only down side is that it does not have noise cancellation. However, this does not seem to affect the sound quality that much and people can still hear me even though there is a little bit of background noise. Except for the lack of noise cancellation and average sound quality, this is a good inexpensive headset and worth a try."
2,Poor reception.....bad product,"The range of this headset is terrible. I cannot even put my Razr in my pants pocket and use the headset without terrible static. I am very dissapointed, and do not even use the headset anymore."
4,"Good bluetooth device, quelity just ienough","I was expecting have a better sound quality, but for a PC handset us just enough."
3,Just like all the others,Ear piece is a joke. Had it a week before it broke. Sound is average at best . People on other end of call say voice is sometimes full of static.I've tried at least 8 different headsets all are nothing great. I've gone back to the wired kind until someone finally manufactures a descent unit.
5,Perfect,I have had this red dot sight on my colt light weight AR-15 for 10 years now and I would not exchange it for anything else.you can also change the size of the dot from # 1-10 by just turning the knob.The dot does not distort when you make it larger as some of other really expensive red dot sights do.I would recommend this for anyone looking to buy a compact red do sight with a carry handle.
5,A new facet of understanding Scripture,"Having read through the Bible over twenty times, I am always fascinated that each time it is fresh. How precious then is it, when we have an excellent Aramaic translation to draw richer insights and meaning! I appreciate the ""Highlights"" and ""Beyond the Text"", but most of all, simply having this translation to compare with others makes the joy of discovery and insight all the more profound!"
3,This book does not live up it's cover.,"The book claims to be a VB Manual for all levels, in fact it's an ok intro for begginers, and staying clear of the more advanced and even some itermediary topics.I suggest that if you want a Begginers guide to VB.NET that you cansider this book, otherwise you will be disapointed."
5,Quality book from Sybex,"Congratulations to Sybex for distributing the book in PDF format on the CD. I installed the book on my PC and now I can jump to any chapter/section and search for any word. Works better than any indexing scheme for me and the figures are in color. I wish more publishers would provide their books in electronic format.The book is great. It covers more topics than any other book on VB. You'll find more information on graphics and GDI+ in this book than in all others combined. The same is true for many topics, like the print controls, the new collections (ArrayLists, HashTables) and the StringBuilder class, to mention the ones I've found most useful so far. The chapter on printing, for example, includes several interesting samples, including one that prints tabular data. All the topics are well explained and demonstrated with small appls, not just a few statements.Lots of useful code."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this book primarily because the cover promised a fully-searchable copy of the book in electronic form, but I could not access it. I tried on two different computers, even updated Adobe Reader on one machine. No luck. This one is going back."
2,Too many errors. You'll get lost easily.,"I haven't finished the whole book yet. I'm still working on it. It seems like it's got some good info, but BOY! ERRORS! It seemed like the author was on fire when he wrote the book and never had the time to review his codes. Sometimes he'll even refer to things or buttons in the IDE that's not even there. So I have to assume that he used one and only one computer for the entire writing process and never bothered to test/verify the programs on someone else's computer. I've wasted so much time! So if you want to buy the book, just read it the way you would read a story book."
3,Great Book - Poor Coding Style,"The book is great once you know your way around. However, the coding style is very poor. It looks more like code for VB6ers who are too dumb or too lazy to switch to .NET but want to use it anyway to get rid of the ""Wanna-be coder"" attribute. VB has grown, but unfortunately, some authors haven't. I prefer books from authors who can pick up changes quicker than that."
3,Pretty good,"Lileth Fair Volume 2 is a decent continuation from Volume 1, although not quite as satisfying. The main reason is there is not nearly as much material on volume 2. Both volumes have a few weak songs, but it is more noticeable on volume 2 because there are fewer songs overall."
3,Nice,"To be honest, I wouldn't have gotten this CD if it wasn't for 'Angel' and 'I Do,' the only songs on here that I have heard. I was introduced to some more Natalie Merchant, which was nice. This version of 'Angel' is wonderful. I love the extra piano parts. Personally, I think Sarah doesn't need anyone to sing with her, and (don't jump on me for saying this) I think it would have been better without Emmylou. But it is great. 'I Do' is even better live. The only other song on here that I really liked was 'In the Ghetto,' but I do want to get the other Lilith Fair CDs just so I can hear some other Sarah McLachlan songs live. Okay, sorry for rambling: the bottom line is that most of the songs on here are not very much like Sarah McLachlan, so if you are, like me, a Sarah fan that just wanted to check out some other female singers in that genre... I wouldn't recommend Lilith Fair Vol. 2."
2,VERY Eclectic,"All of the performances found on this CD are good live versions of songs from good artists. I never attended the Lilith Fair when it was around so I didn't know what to expect when I checked this CD out; I picked it up soley for the names I recognized and liked (Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, etc.). After listening to this though I found that I didn't really like most of the songs. Not that they were bad songs or poorly performed but that this album's collection of artists was just too eclectic for my tastes. I'm not a rap fan at all so Queen Latifah's addition wasn't my favorite and the album wasn't stickered despite Tracy Bonham's lyrics. Because of my disappointment I have to give this 2 stars. If you went to the fair and only watched the performances from performers you liked then I'd suggest trying to check this out from your local library. If you like all or most of these artists then maybe this CD is for you."
2,listenable but not really worth the money,"No passionate or inspired musical performances here,just a bunch of females trying to prove something and some ... female-supporting male musicians to help them."
4,Better Than Fiction,"Prominent Soviet scientist falls in love with granddaughter of American President - it sounds like fodder for a best selling novel, so it's all the more remarkable for being true. Susan Eisenhower's account of her love affair with and eventual marriage to Roald Sagdeev is the fascinating story of two people defying the odds of the Cold War to make a life together. From their burgeoning courtship through the maze of beaurocracy they needed to overcome, their story is two-fold: the age-old tale of boy meets girl played out against the intricate politics of a world in transition."
1,Bad deal.,"This assorment is advertised as dimentions 11.2 oz net, shipping weight 4.2 pounds. Now for the truth it weighs one ounce and contains 15 pins. Bad Deal."
2,Network?,"Don't let the name ""Network SurgeArrest"" fool you. There is no network surge protection, just 7 regular old power outlets. I'm sure it's a fine surge protector/power strip, but why slap the name ""Network"" on it? It has nothing to do with networks!"
1,Warning - It Might Not Play on Your Player,"I bought this about a week ago from BARNES & NOBLE and have returned it twice (a total of three copies). None of them would play on a Sony Playstation 3. Sony claims it is the movie. Mill Creek the production company, claims they haven't had any complaints about it not playing and says something must be wrong with my player. I have over 100 Blu-Rays and have since watched 4 other movies. Now remember Mill Creek are the wonderful people that gave us the butchered box set of WISEGUY. Now I need to figure out how to get my money back!"
3,Truth sadder than fiction,I listened to Joey's story Finders Keepers on a library audio rental a few years ago. It was much more melancholy than the movie. The sad thing is that he ended his own life before the movie was released. He was a goofy young man with a big heart and a drug problem. I think that explains some of his poor decision making. If I remember correctly he had voiced his concerns about the movie...he needed the money offered to have it made but it replayed the failures of his life that he didn't seem to be able to get away from. I liked the movie by itself but when compared to the true story it fell short which is why I gave it a 3. I think it is better to watch the movie if you haven't read the book and don't know the true story. I wish the real man could have picked himself up and recovered in as lighthearted a manner as the movie ends. At the end of the book it talks about the movie but I didn't know it had been released. May He rest in peace.
5,The Old West Rides Again,"We love these stories, they sure make taking a long trip seem shorter. We listen to them as we are driving, it keeps us awake, interested, and make the miles go by faster."
5,Much better than stock,I needed better light from my 2002 Jeep. These headlights fit the bill. Much better light and much more light to the sides.
5,bright light,"much brighter headlight for my Wrangler, the regular halogens are too yellow and these are a cleaner whiter light, they don't seem to bother oncoming traffic either, not as annoying as HID bulbs"
2,not worth it,"I got this set to replace my old sylvania regular halogens (no CB, noXV, just H6024) with great hopes, since it does cost more than twice as much. Alas, as much as I would like to see Emperor's new clothes, I couldn't help but notice that it's actually DIMMER than a regular halogen. My friends have commented on the reduced brightness before even knowing that I have changed the bulb. It is painfully obvious. The light output is whiter, yes, but apparently they have made some sacrifices in achieving that color. In my opinion the reduced brightness is not worth it.Oh, on top of that, one of the lights just burned out yesterday, after less than a year of service (more like 10 months). I'm here shopping for another H6024 hence I thought I'd make a comment. Either get a real HID kit or just stick with regular halogens. These ""high tech"" halogens are not going to defy physics of halogen lamps. Save your money."
4,Good beam,"Decent white light output and a nice beam. Great improvement over stock in my 2004 Wrangler, and a cheaper alternative to HID lights. Good mod, saves the cash for better Jeep mods."
2,dissapointed twice,the first time the bell set came the low D Flat was broken off. I reordered only to find that it happened again! Don't buy this unless you don't need all the keys.
4,another fine album,"i came upon appleseed cast rather late, but i'm pleased with what i've heard. although mare vitalis is my favorite album, two conversations takes a lot of the sound from previous works and rocks it up a notch.highlights on the album are hanging marionette (track 2) and innocent vigilant ordinary (track 8)."
5,Clarke Family History,This book was very informative. It confirmed a lot of ideas that my family had about who are ancestors were. Anyone who is looking into the history of the Clarkes will be very pleased.
2,Its NOT powder if you get it from 360Living,"Even though the picture states Henna Powder, I received a henna cream from the seller 360Living. Not at all the same product. Also, the prices changes a lot. When I purchased mine, the price was 7 usd, now, a week later its 3,5 usd. Go after the powder, not the cream.Previously I ordered this product from Lulu's Beautysalon, and I recieved powder. no problems"
3,Not much mystery,"his was a very light read, and I'll read more in the series, but themystery lacked oomph for me. I had it figured out long before the finalreveal and there were several times when I wanted to reach into the book andslap some sense into China and tell her, ""Look at this! What is the matterwith you?!?"" LOL The book held my interest to the end because I waswaiting to see when China would have an epiphany and realize whodunit. I'lladmit that I don't often figure out the mystery before the protagonist does,so maybe this was a fluke. I'll rate it a 3 and see what the other books inthe series are like."
4,A simple reference for a complex subject,"This book exposes the essential Quantum Mechanical topics in a non-traditional order, and explores more advaced subjects as well, without losing clarity. The notation is easier to follow than most graduate level text books. Particularly good chapters are those concerning to Quantization of Radiation and Second Quantization."
1,Why do people like this book?,"We just started using this book for our Graduate Quantum Theory class. The whole book is just a muddled mess. Baym does not bother to define terms, and uses a rather odd mix of notation that is different from every other quantum book I own.If you want a decent quantum book buy Libov"
1,Utterly useless!,"A completely useless waste of paper and money. $60 for what, if you please? Contains nothing you wouldn't find in other common texts, only there it is better explained. Fails miserably in problem-solving techniques. Very poorly structured. ZERO stars!!!"
1,Don't buy the Kindle edition!,"A fantastic book which has been messed up badly in the kindle edition without any figures and bad formatting. I think this is disrespect to the good author of this book. I was very disappointed and cheated without so many images and figures which formed an important part of this well written book. I certainly would demand a refund, since there was no warning about absence of images in the kindle version. However, I recommend the paperback version which I hope has the relevant images and figures."
5,Where's the next edition?,"I hope you authors plan to do the next edition to cover 2001-2010. I found the current edition very useful for what to look for and when. Eclipses, times etc. All very helpful."
1,Dimensions matter!,"What is the size of the cabinet? I have limited space, can't buy without measurements."
3,Not Close To Essential And Sloppy Production Sink It,"This set could have been a landmark but falls short of the glory in several ways:1. No trio or quartet sides2. How can you leave off Benny's closing theme ""Goodbye"", one of the best ballads he ever did?3. The master for ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" is TERRIBLE. It is the Victor recording but with so much reverb it sounds like it was recorded in a manhole. AND the song fades out half way into side 2!!!!! What the *(*&^%^%$?!If there ever was an example of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, this is it."
4,Good all-around reference book,"I like the book very much, however, I feel the layout and the photography could have been tighter and more artful. There's a bit of a rushed-to-put-together feel about it, which is disappointing. Nevertheless, good value for a finishing reference book because it applies to all needlework disciplines."
2,Tries to do too much,"Thankfully I checked this out from the library rather than purchasing it. I found that it offered a whole lot of different crafts, with really quite basic information for each one. My main hobby is knitting, and I learned nothing here that I did not already know from my simplest books. It essentially gives one option for each task at hand in each craft."
1,"Largely worthless, way too expensive, no real ""finishing"" at all","As you can see from my reviews, of the hundreds of needlework books I own this is one of my worst reviews. So you can see how poorly illustrated the stitches are, I have included in Images above, 3 pages. I absolutely defy you to be able to decipher the steps of the stitches. You usually can't even see a needle! Whenever I see a stitch encyclopedia or dictionary, I always see how it covers bullions as these are among the least intuitive and difficult stitches in hand embroidery. Here, there is only a picture of the final bullion with not one diagram! Impossible. Very, very few of the stitches are shown in context with the fabric or just ""what"" is being finished. And in a compendium of finishing, I expected to how to finish a pillow or curtains or frame a piece of embroidery. Nothing like that here. As another reviewer indicated, the costs for new and used volumes here are extortionist for what you get. Not worth it."
4,"Great book, as long as you dont use Amazon's sellers","I have only briefly looked through this book, but I love what I have seen so far. The instructions are brief but thorough, the illustrations helpful and accurate. Definitely a good purchase. A word of caution, do not use any of Amazon's sellers. After recovering from the heart attack I had after seeing the prices listed, I went to Interweave's website and purchased an ebook edition for $20.00. Spending over $200.00 for a new book, or $80.00 for a used book, makes absolutely no sense at all to me, even to have a hard copy on had. Print it out, print the sections out you need, and save well over double the cost."
1,"Stupid, wandering, waste of money",I was hoping for some hard evidence. What a bunch of blather from crop circles to the Masons and about every conspiracy you can think of just wandering around this movie. Put it in the trash.
1,this book teaches fighting NOT sharing!,"This book has absolutely nothing to do with sharing! sentences like ""Lisa smacks Sam.Ow"" will only encourage toddlers to hit not share. In fact, there is no mention of the word ""share"" at all! Having mommy save the day by bringing out another toy car to resolve the conflict is so unrealistic...!"
1,have not received it yet,"I am sorry, but I am still waiting for Sam's Car to arrive. I received an email before Christmas that said the book would not arrive until after Christmas. I am still waiting for it. Please send it ASAP. I will give the ratinjg score after I receive the book. Sincerly, Lee Anna Wright"
1,This book is NOT about compromise!!!,"I was compelled to write my own review of this book, because I didn't want any other mothers who were looking for books on sharing to make the same mistake that I did. This book basically teaches that instead of sharing, children should hit each other until mom comes to settle the dispute for them. I didn't read it to my child once and wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE looking for ways to teach their children about sharing."
4,A lot better than I thought,"I loved The Police but I have to admit I was a little skeptical of Andy Summers tackling Monk since he isn't from a true jazz guitar background. But I have to say that overall he did a pretty good job. The sound reminds me of Bill Frisell and although Summers doesn't really knock me out on his soloing his tonal pallette is pleasant and his style is suitable to Monk's music. If you are new to jazz guitar I would check out guys like Wes Montgomery, Tal Farlow, and Mark Elf for a more mainstream look at jazz guitar; or something a little more rock-edged also there's John Scofield & Mike Stern & Paul Bollenback."
3,more of a tease than a thrill,This book does not deliver as a stand alone novel. Even for this genre not enough story. Did he just bring this book out to kill off Peter Macklin or perhaps to free the character of a wife? Is this book just the tease for the next (high priced) Peter Maklin mystery to come? The story felt cranked out and flat and the ending disjointed and very ho hum.
5,"Great for ""back yard engineers""!","I've been looking for a book to help me with a few projects/inventions, and easy enough for a non-engineer to understand. This is the book! It made a pretty complicated concept easy."
4,Wonderful Item,"I love this stuff. Use it as an aftershave only, but it reduces the irritation I normally get by a great degree. This is probably the one of the best products for reducing razor burn."
2,Not really sure what it does,There are probably better after shave balms. I use it as pre-shave oil and I guess it's OK. The razor doesn't really glide that much though.
5,good product to buy,"For the past 18 years I was suffering each time I shave, but since I tried this product I feel comfortable shaving...it reduced the irritation after shave and the scent is pleasant (like Rose water) but not very strong or even feminine..."
2,"Just use skin lotion, unless it's a pre-shave for you","The very feminine pink bottle (the liquid is pink in this case) was the first sign that I had made a mistake. The $28 plus shipping was soon realized to be the second.While this lasts a long time, it really doesn't do anything for me, that non-comedogenic skin lotion doesn't do better, for much less. I'll try Witch Hazel as an after shave and lotion next I suppose. Ugh, tired of bleeding and burning, but, I don't look too hot with a beard.Has a slight sting. A tad slick or greasy. Seems to work ok as a pre-shave lotion, if applied in a very small amount. Smell is pleasant, if also not a bit too metro for my tastes."
1,this is a piece of junk,"I bought this thing from home depot. I came on here to see if others were having the same issues i am...apparantly they are.This unit was professionally installed. It overlooks my driveway...it is useless. It only detects something if you walk right up to it... and I mean like 1 foot away!!!! No joke.....It has good light, but it it absolutely useless, it's like it's blind...worthless junk. now I have to call the electrician again to get rid of this thing."
2,Journeyman Motion Sensing Security Light,"I had this light installed at the four corners of my house. The one above the garage door has caused me the most problem. At first it seemed it was always on at night. The light on the left as you face it burned out. The one on the right was OK. I had the light bulb replaced and a couple of weeks later it burned out again. The right one is still OK. I am not sure what sets this light off. I have tried adjusting it and it still seems to be on most of the time. The other three lights do not seem to be as unpredictable, but in general I have problems with the lights staying on or coming on for no reason. I am retired and have the time to watch these lights from inside the house. I would try another brand if I were to get any security lights."
1,Don't Bother!!!,"Received the light on Aug 17th and every night since, I have been outside trying to adjust the sensor to work. No matter how its aimed, what adjustments in the control panel are used, it does not detect anything unless you go up on a ladder and wave something in front of the sensor. The only time it activates is when it's in the test mode and thats only for a few seconds.I have done all the trouble shooting tips in the manual but nothing works. The light has its own 15amp circuit/breaker, it's wired correctly and is mounted at approx. 8""6"" from the ground. I have had $30 motion lights work better then this $65 unit.I should have heeded the advice of the previous poster.I'll being calling customer service today at HeathCO LLC and telling them about their junk product."
5,Excellent Book - Noteworthy History of Transhumanism,"This book has got the buzz and the facts clear. It is a book about the ""pioneers"" of transhumanism and what they did early on that has set the pace for the futurists today.Who else is going to tell the story but a writer that admires the ideas of transhumanists and also can laugh with us? If you cannot laugh at yourself, what is the point of living a long and enjoyable life? There isn't, and this is to Brian Alexander's credit.We owe a lot to the Los Angeles Transhumanists - FM Esfandiary, Natasha Vita-More, Eric Drexler, Max More, Ralph Merkle, Greg Fahy - the entire gang.If you want to read a book that literally gets you to go to the frig and get a beer, kick back on the sofa, and dream of a long life - this is the book!Left of Center - but thinking toward the future.Jason Jefferson"
2,Nice cover. Nice concept. After that point...eh.,"I wanted to like this book. However, I found the writing very droll. I just couldn't feel the emotion, the ideals, the ""rapture"" of the subject matter. Instead, the book is bogged down in endless and pointless biographical details...this person did this, and then this, and so on. Maybe I'm not giving it the benefit of the doubt, but there are other books on transhumanism I found far more interesting, informative, and readable."
5,"Runs Fine, takes a while to install.","Game runs great, just takes a while to install. Biggest problem is that you can not be running anything else while it installs. But since windows reccomends that you not run anything else, we are all doing that already, Right?There is little or no lag in the areas I have been to, and the graphics are definatley not sub par."
1,Ever crap or Ever cracked,"Has problems. Sony is working on the patch. Will not even play unless you go through abunch of gyrations. Still have not got mine to play. If I had wanted a lesson on computer repair, I would have bought computer repair. I just wanted to play the game. And, being they make most of their money on playing on line, It looks to me like they would have sold a product that WORKS."
2,"Game runs fine, but why the hype?","First of all, to adress a previous reviewer: I have Windows XP and I've had zero problems running the game. It takes a bit to start up, but the gameplay itself is fine.However, after listening for years to all the hype about Everquest, I'm very disappointed. I find this game to be really boring. I just don't see what the fuss is about."
2,The Ultimate Time Sink,"I started playing in 1998. They have a little feature in game that will tell you how 'old' your character ('toon) is. I remember when I looked at the 'age' of the character and saw 70 days. 70 days!? 70 days * 24 hours/day = 1,680 hours. What a tragic waste of valuable time in my life.I pulled the plug. Lo and behold, I worked harder at work and was promoted not once, but twice. I met a woman and got married. I remodeled my basement/garage.Do not bother with this game. The longer you play, the more demanding on your time it is. LIVE LIFE!"
1,Step 1: NO LIFE 101,"If you never want to have a significant other buy this game NOW!I nearly divorced my husband over this POS. Thank GAWD he has more than 1/2 a brain & saw his compulsive tendencies could not manage such a terrible waste of time & chose his family over this mess. We're talking 11 hours passing by like it's a minute people. There is even a support group for the people who've lost loved ones to this scourge.This game has NO END folks. Buy a freaking game with AN END!!!!! SO YOU CAN HAVE A FREAKING LIFE!I guess this thing would be ok for someone who'd like to explore what it's like to be crippled, or terminally ill & has no family or friends to think of. Maybe it'd make a good game for dire enemies....If so, have at it.But be warned, this game is trouble for those with any sort of compulsive/addictive behaviors in their past----leading to a high probability of losing family, friends & relations w/your significant other.You've been warned."
2,DVD shoul be better quality,"The movie is classic in its own way, but the DVD version is heavily cut and the quality of the picture is not the best.Because of this only 2 stars"
5,Awesome album,"All I can do is just write a brief review and speak my point of view, but it's not sane. It's not sane."
4,TRACKS ARE WRONG!,"This is a good show, but that tracks are all listed in a totally wrong order, even here on Amazon. Listen to the samples. I don't know how a major label makes a mistake like this, I have never seen anything like it.The fans deserve better than this, and so does Blind Melon."
1,I own two pairs. Both had loose yarns and a hole at the bottom after only one wear,"the title says it all.Gold Toe normally makes good quality socks. Not sure whether these socks are ""irregular"" or of poor workmanship. It happens to both pairs. If leaves a trail of loose yarns walking across the carpet and then the bottom starts to split and several small holes are showing. If it only happens to one pair, but NO it happens to my 2nd pair as well.And the elastic band on the top is just so tight and I am a regular size guy and yet I can' pull the socks all the way up otherwise it will strangle my calves.Not recommended at all."
3,Weird Movie,Wife was not impressed with this one. Geena does play an excellent drunk disfunctial paretn in this one. But man these folks are have the worst problems.
1,Black yes...comedy no.,"Unlike the movie, let's keep this short and sweet. This movie was miserable to watch. It pulled out all the stops to be quirky and interesting, but in the end, it was about a group of repulsive characters, not being funny."
4,Rides the line..,"..between a black comedy and a straight drama. There are some laughs along the way. The degree to which this guy's life is accident-ridden is what gets you chuckling in a few places, though it wasn't as funny as some I've seen in this genre. For a much funnier black comedy around seriously dysfunctional families, it's hard to beat Almodovar's very twisted but touchingly hilarious ""What Have I Done To Deserve This"". All the same, ""Accidents Happen"" is a fairly well-made picture with good performances all around, not least of which is given by the main star Harrison Gilbertson who puts in a great turn as Billy. Reminded me of some middle-school friends I grew up with."
1,What was the author thinking?,"Somone gave me this book as a gift, a joke. It has to be the stupidist book I've ever read. I guess it was written to be funny, but it really missed the mark. Normally, I pass books on when I'm finished reading them as I can't bring myself to throw a book away. But this one went straight to the trash."
1,"not at all funny, not at all smart - disappointing","I bought this years ago, and just found it during a move, still unopened. I'm so glad we never had it around when our French friends were visiting. I thought this would have some funny, insightful jokes - the kind that we can laugh at even when the jokes are on us. Instead, it was mean-spirited, unfunny, and historically inaccurate.There is no great ""patriotism"" displayed by insulting others. France and the United States have a long and mutually beneficial relationship. This calendar was cheap and stupid."
1,Too bad I can't give it a ZERO!,"Only a small unknown publisher, desperate for attention and costumers, would accept to publish such rubbish!The content of this indescribable collection of - not even funny - made-up ""facts"" about the French is not only fabricated, but is obviously the product of a sick and ignorant mind who, shame on him/her, prefered to choose anonymity rather than display his name in full light on the cover of this abnoxious farce of a ""book"".To the distasteful author's comment about French cheese: ""Their cheese smell like people's feet""; I have to respond: Yes, sure, French cheese might be malodorous, but your book REALLY stinks!"
2,Songs from other CD's repackaged,"Well if I had known I was just buying the same tracks from previous CD's, I'd have saved my money. The music is good but I feel ripped off as I have Living with the past and A little light music already. Thanks Sony!"
1,Repackaging the same stuff over and over. No thanks!,"Buddy Holly & The Crickets and Jethro Tull are my two favorite artists/groups of all-time but I've reached my limit of buying the same repackaged Tull material over and over again. I did not buy this album and I won't buy another Tull album until I see something NEW and FRESH which will probably never be.Ian Anderson is 62 years old and I imagine he's tired of trying to write new songs that could be done in Jethro Tull style. So in the meantime, I imagine his former record company is re-packaging everything they possibly can to try to make a buck. And I remember an interview I heard with Anderson where he said he was against that type of thing. So I imagine he's not happy with it either."
4,Concise Guide to Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neurology,"An excellent pocket reference for externs, interns, and residents. Provides detailed information on a variety of topics designed to help formulate correct diagnoses. A must for all starting out in the behavioral health field."
1,Egregiously Inaccurate,"Trimble has made a cottage industry out of blaming patients for their physical injuries and diseases. His book on NeuroAnatomy classifies ME (CFS) as a ""disorder of motivation."" And in Somatoform Disorders Trimble includes ME (CFS) and Fibromyalgia as somatoform disorders noting that people with ME show ""Abnormal Illness Behaviour"" like avoiding exercise, remaining bedbound and ""often adopting a wheelchair lifestyle and a destiny of dependence."" There are over 4,000 articles in peer reviewed medical journals showing frank biological pathology in ME. Trimble's antiscience bias makes him difficult to believe on any medical topic."
4,Really Sweet Book,"Well, what I really liked most about this book is that the author didn't make the story *corny*. The characters aren't one sided (like: friendy,ditzy,smart,dumb), they all have REAL personalities, and the reason behind them. I could relate to Olivia on this one. The book is really sweet and has mushy moments, but can also be risque. It really makes me care about the girls, and make me want to get the other books to find out what happens to them. So, like..go get this! ;)"
5,Fantastic Book!!,Rachel Vail has started a fantastic series beginning with this book. It relates a lot to girls of or near the age of twelve. In one part I even cried because it was so touching to see Zoe give up so much for a friend.
5,A Real Page-turner!,"This is a great book about a girl named Zoe that faces many challenges of the 7th grade. She's incredibly athletic and is friends with most of the boys. Her feelings about a boy change, but her new best friend, CJ, likes him too. She couldn't do anything to hurt CJ, and she really doesn't know what to do when Tommy sends her a note saying that he likes her. This is also a ""comedy."" Zoe has 5 older sisters, 4 of them good little girls and 1 monster. This book is a tale of friendship and choices of the 7th grade. That's why I'm giving it a 5 star."
2,Fits small items,The primary reason I don't really like this case is how tight it fits everything. I can't figure out what this would fit. It's super tight on digital cameras and all I can say is to check the size of your item and remember this is a neoprene case. It's not as big as the description says because it has to wrap around the item you're putting in it. That's what makes it smaller than it seems.
4,I still love DLG no matter what!,"Personally, I like Swing On better because there were more songs I liked and I find myself on this CD constantly FF to the next song. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good CD but I would have liked to see more of the flavor they had with ""Lagrimas"" on Swing On. That's really the only reason I gave it a four. I still love ya guys!"
2,Pathetic,"This CD is a joke, so full of silly and childish moments that I'm embarrased to play it. It is one thing to be creative, it is another to simply throw in all sorts of musical ideas without a sense of how if affects a song. They had promise, but this is sad."
4,Esta pegao!,"With Gotcha, DLG is showing that they can cover all styles, up to and including bachata. Each album impresses me with the ease in which they handle, blend, and move back and forth between salsa, R&B, hip hop, house, reggae, and now bachata. The neoyorkino feel for all these flavors is evident, and they seem just as strong with any of the styles. My favorites include 'Angeles', 'Gotcha'. 'A Veces Me Pregunto', and 'Eres Mi Vida'. Fraga's raps flow seamlessly on that last track, and Huey and James always show and prove. Plus I think it's dope that they're bringing Chika and Cyndi to the forefront as well, letting them show skills. The result is a CD that's got something for everyone and can turn you on to different styles that you may not have been a fan of previously. Chacho, este CD esta pegao!"
4,Great fusion!,"This work is pure synergy, the combined energy of hip hop, caribbean, rap and latin rythms combined to create explosive beauty. All songs are not to the level of De Oro and Acuyuye, but then again, those two are so great they'll keep some of us impatiently waiting for their next album."
4,good alternative for better-known Latin stars,"This is really an album that grows on you. DLG combines Latin sounds with modern dance music, like Ricky Martin, with the difference that DLG's music is much better. ""Acuyuye"" should have been a world-wide hit!"
1,"Just A Trim The Mistake-Proof Hair Trimmer, 1 trimmer not working","Just A Trim The Mistake-Proof Hair Trimmer, 1 trimmerItem was not working, the metal base plate that let the battery poitive to negative pole was absent. There fore the product does not work as the one I had before."
1,Shipped defective,"I had the same experience as a previous reviewer who bought a non-functional product. Put fresh batteries in as per the instructions, and the machine didn't work."
1,Awful,"This is a cheap, impractical device. The motor doesn't run smoothly, even on brand new batteries."
4,Saves a trip for a hair cut,"It didn't do too well when I first took it out of the package, but have found that the more I use it the better it trims. I guess it just needed to be used a little to loosen up the cutters. I used to go for a hair cut every month and a half, but now I can keep my ""do"" up by myself and save $30. I plan on getting another one if this one ever conks out."
1,"Should be called, ""JUST A RIP OFF""",Don't waste your time or money. This thing is junk. Couldn't even get it to work with new batteries. Forget it.
2,BE AWARE - YOU NEED BATTERIES!,"I bought this item to keep my young son's hair trimmed. He hates our home clippers, sitting still for a haircut is rather hard for him (he's young and hate people messing with his head or hair). From what I could see from the television ads and description, this was a perfect solution.I assumed that it was a comb with a razor blade in it, and a few quick combs of the item would produce decent results.I was wrong. I've not even bothered to show this to my son. I got the two AAA batteries it required, put them in the unit, turned the unit on, and turned it off again almost immediately.It was loud, noisy, very vibrating - worse than the grooming clippers we already own. It probably does what it is supposed to do, but it does so very noisily (not disclosed in the description), and with the aid of batteries (not supplied or advised as needed in the description)."
1,"""Just A Disaster""","As a review hound, I had to feed back to the system. Just a Trim may work for certain types of hair, but I'm skeptical. For average type and length it was a disaster. The guides given, used at a perpendicular angle, made little or no contact with hair. Thus having to create your own angle, it was hit or miss what you'd get. A nightmare is what I got! Nice idea, terrible workable design."
1,IDEA VILLAGE ARE CROOKS! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! BEWARE!!,I would NEVER NEVER NEVER purchase a product from IDEA VILLAGE. They are criminals! I returned some merchandise and they never gave me credit for it saying they never received the returned merchandise which I know for a fact they did! So you better hope your junky product works or you are SOL!THIEVES! BEWARE! DO NOT buy from them!
4,"It works, but be careful","This doggone thing works, if you are careful and don't get into a rush It will give you a very nice trim. If you are careless or a klutz it will take a chunk out of your hair and leave a large nick. Mine came with a loose triming guide slide, which slides out of place when using. always my luck...if a product has an anomoly it is this one that I will receive. Can't sell this one short though, it works just be heedful of its potential to nick when using it. Hope yours has a nice tight trimming adjustment slide."
3,"Helpful, but barely skims the surface of available patterns","Nice reference book, easy to follow with a price guide in the back. Unfortunatly, it has a limited number of patterns represented and no information on the types of pieces available for all but 4 or 5 patterns. I purchased this book hoping to learn more about the Rosemarie #6044 pattern I inherited from my father, but will have to try again with a different reference. I ended up keeping it for the information on patterns from the 1920's. It's helped me identify a Morimura Luncheon set from 1922 and other Noritake items I've purchased. The book also contains some limited information on old advertisements and some care suggestions for fine china."
3,Nothing special to write of,"The toy is durable to play with. My son is really into pokemon, and loves to be physical with his toys."
1,Not forward compatible,This product is not forward compatible even if you manually change the compatibliity run mode of the application in Windows. My machine is Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. No upgrade option is available through Symantec.
2,Nervous Ravages PvD's Good Name! (And so does he.),"Nervous records, once again, has released perhaps the poorest produced tracks from Paul van Dyk. Although he has been rated by DJ magazine as the #1 producer world-wide, Nervous Records presents us the anti-cream of the crop. The tracks are cheap, housey, and undynamic realizations of PvD's artistic visions. If you want to hear his good words, buy Seven Ways or 45 RPM. These are, hands down, the finest of his works over the past decade."
3,EARLY PAUL VAN DYK CLASSIC...,"NOT UP THERE WITH ""FOR AN ANGEL"", ""TELL ME WHY"", OR ""ANOTHER WAY"", OR EVEN HIS REMIXES FOR BT...BUT IF YOUR INTO TRANCE AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A TRANCE ADDICT, THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS FOR YOUR COLLECTION...THE CHORDS AND VOCALS ARE A BIT DATED SOUNDING, AND THE EFFECTS ARE DEFINITELY OLD SCHOOL...BUT THE OVERALL FEELING IS GREAT..."
