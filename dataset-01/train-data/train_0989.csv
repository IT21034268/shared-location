2,Formulaic Alien Shoot 'em Up,"""Kitsch"" is not just the actor's name, it also describes the obvious attempts to be a sort of 21st century surface warfare Top Gun with Independence Day aliens thrown in. You know how the movie ends before the first 10 minutes are up. It's still fun to watch as the FX cover a lot of sins in the plot and acting. Rent, don't buy."
2,Hmm not worth your time.,"If you like completely over the top action packed unrealistic movies, this one's for you! I was not impressed at all."
1,Can I have my money back?,"This is my first movie review. I felt compelled to write this one because I only got a few scenes into the movie and want my $3.99 back. The scene where the ""rebel"" tough guy spots the girl with huge breasts pouting over the bar because she didn't get a burrito (from a bar?) and he walks up to save the day but she (while sticking her breasts out and pouting) acts all snotty and says ""I'm hungry!"" when the guy asks for her name, tells me all I need to know about this movie. It was written with teenage guys in mind. It will be lots of mindless action and hot women acting like men kicking ass. No thanks."
3,Sit Back And Enjoy!,This is another one of those movies you just sit back and enjoy. It's SiFi... don't try to compare it to War And Peace.
3,An entertaining movie to watch.,The story might be predictable but its a heart pumping watch. We all enjoy it and would not mond seeing it again and again.
1,...watch it for the CGI.,Entertaining! Don't watch it for the story line or the acting. I can't believe how badly acted was this film!
4,I really liked it.,"This is my kind of movie. Blood, guts, guns, bigger guns, aliens and all the stuff that goes with this kind of movie. I liked the cast and thought the movie was much better than the reviews. My son in law even liked it and he is usually very critical of movies like this."
4,kinda good,"If you view yourself a movie critic and like to figure the movie out instead of just watching a movie, you probably won't like this. (The husband thought it was ""stupid and transparent."" He thinks he sounds really smart when he calls movies things like ""transparent."") But if you enjoy sci-fi, good looking people, and cool transformer-esque graphics, you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie, as i did."
3,Normal Action Movie.,"Just a regular action packed movie. Definitively 3 stars not more. If you want to enjoy a action movie not expecting to much, see it."
4,Battleship movie,This movie surprised me and was better than I thought it would be. The action scenes were well made and the plot was descent. Just good enough to make it quite enjoyable.
1,seriously??,"super predictable, crappy action, story line is been done over and over and over. get real and do yourself a favor, don't watch that stupid flick."
1,Ugh!,"Somehow I knew it would be bad, but I didn't know the extent. Great effects. Spotty plot. Ridiculous ending.On a technical note, the volume was very sporadic so I had to crank it up for some of the dialog but hurry to turn it down for music and other effects.Would have given it two stars if the sound issue didn't make it completely unwatchable."
5,great move,"This was a great movie. I love it, they actually put the USS Missiouri out to sail again after 10 years for this movie.Great effects"
3,Awesome picture and audio qualitty,It's worth renting the Blu-ray for the sound quality. Tremendous amount of bass. Not so good story but enteraining for the first half of the movie. It definitely gets boring towards the end.
4,Better than most reviews would have you believe.,"Don't read or listen to the majority of reviews. This movie has some of the coolest weaponry and CGI effects of any I have seen. I particularly liked the aliens ""hands"". The story line isn't terrible. The characters are reasonably developed and can be related with. The battleship ending I'll agree was a little hokey but if you just enjoy the good human versus horrible alien confrontation put the game out of your mind. After all, the Earth was saved again!!!"
5,Action Packed Surprise,"A real pick me up action packed movie with quite a few surprises. You'll come away full and satisfied, I will be watching this again."
4,Battleship,"We enjoyed the movie the first time we saw it, so we bought it. It is entertaining and we like these type of movies."
3,battleship,Come on it was just to far out there even me. If they have use big moe still moored i twould have been beliveable.
3,So-So,"Ah,kind of ""Tongue in Cheek"", The acting not that great but the action and effects were worth watching the whole movie.Thats just my opinion though. Still by all means,check it out,theres just enough action to hold your interests."
3,Does not meet the level of expectation I had.,"Was hoping for an edge of the seat experience, which it did not produce. The special effects were fine and I liked the cast of characters. Just not as exciting as I was hoping it would be."
1,Explosions and Stuff,"I'm under the impression that this movie was made for (and perhaps by) pre-adolescent boys. It reminds me of watching my nephews with their military toys. BOOM! Destroyers spinning mid-air... on fire... while the invincible battleship plays superman with its hidden anti-physics engine. Really, it's simple: If you like to watch things explode... this is the movie for you. If, on the other hand, you appreciate a well-written plot, clever dialogue, and quality acting... don't waste your money on this one. It's really that straight forward, folks."
1,Horrible. Insulting. Juvenile. This movie tried too hard.,"This movie was so bad I walked out of it and I haven't done that since Vanilla Sky.There was a scene in the first half of the movie that went on for probably 20 minutes - where all that stuff is crashing into the ocean, into the ships, etc. It just went on forever and ever, just for the sake of what was supposed to be terrifying. It wasn't - I just wished it to be over so we could get on with the movie.The acting was amateurish and unbelievable. Everyone on the ship looked like an idiot who didn't pass the 4th grade.This is the type of movie that would appeal to junior high to high school and those with minds like it."
2,C'mon...,"Spoiler - one of 5 alien ships that travel an unheard of distance to earth crashes into one of our satellites and then plunges to earth to be destroyed...um, I couldn't get past the idiocy that we're to accept that a superior intelligence doesn't have radar on their ships so they don't run into stuff. And that was after 25 minutes of ""character creating"" footage. Thank god for fast forward...Loved the special effects, though - I'm a ridiculous sucker for them..."
3,Fun,"This was a fun movie. Not super intelligent but very entertaining. Popcorn, twizzlers and nothing to do this is your ticket."
3,Pure NAVY/WAR Propaganda,The story is simple and just the frame (like in a porn) for a 90min Navy/War Hurra we go to war patriotism propaganda. Could be an UFA movie 70 years ago. Action scenes and special effects are perfect!
2,Awful,"What was Liam Neeson thinking? One of the worst movies I've seen in recent years, as bad as Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon, and very similar special effects to that movie. Only saving grace that it was so bad -- like the part where they are shooting on a grid system to imitate the board game Battleship -- that it was funny, much in the way Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness are so bad they can be enjoyable."
2,Disaster,"The plot was too predictable. Taylor Kitsch started out as a hippie who has disappointed most everyone time and time again, and later on saves the world and became the hero. How predictable is that!Things I don't get:a) how was he promoted so quickly in the Navy?b) how aliens who has technology to travel light years can't figure out our ""Art of War"" strategy?c) why the alien's weakness was so easily unraveled?d) how the Missouri and crew were so easily moved out of the harbor? How was the ammunition obtained?e) why the aliens didn't have their own long-distance communication device and had to use ours?f) if extinction was the goal, why won't the 3 alien ships just blast away all the destroyers trapped in the hemisphere to begin with?Verdict: not the effort to watch."
2,You sank my intelligence,"I wasn't expecting much from a movie named after a board game, but wow! This was quite possibly the stupidest movie I have ever seen. It was literally impossible to suspend disbelief. The plots made no sense. The characters actions made no sense. By the end, I felt the aliens deserved to win because humans had made this movie.I will say the use of actual veterans and injured veterans was the only thing good about this movie. That is something that movies should do more of."
1,Independence Day Navy Style,"I should have known, just before renting it, that anything with Rhianna as the key actor in the film can't be good, and I was right. I was able to stomach most of it, except her bad acting, until the ending when it just so happens that out of the blue the veterans from the Navy museum ship the ""Missouri"" just happened to all be there, dressed in uniform and ready to take down the aliens. Oh, and by the way, the ship was completely filled with live ordinance. One Veteran even said he was ""Ready to rock and roll???"" Give me a break! How many 70'ish veterans do you know that go around saying that... even those who are not U.S. Veterans. CHEESY!If you want to waste your time and see this, don't expect anything original or thrilling. You are probably better off just watching Independence Day again."
4,SUPRISING,"I wasn't sure what exactly to expect when I decided to watch this move. I decided to give it 4 stars because of its entertainment value. While the movie can be cheesy at times, I rather enjoyed the story, effects and entertainment as a whole. I have watched this movie 4 times now and it's still as enjoyable as the first time."
2,B Movie,"look I'm a screw up but i know every thing. ooh crap every one is dead i need to take charge ,,,I'm the herothe endthat was the movie..i saved you 19.99"
4,Good action movie,"This falls into the good old action movie category. The script won't win any prices, but I enjoyed some of the humor and for most of the time, the story kept moving along at a pretty good pace. I was also surpised that Rihanna did a pretty good job unlike that Huntington woman in Transformers. Don't overthink it, just sit back and enjoy the ride."
4,Battleship,"A little far fetched, but a great sci-fi movie. We really enjoyed it. The effects were ""out of this world"" The streaming quality was very good."
2,Battleship HD,This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. It was horribly written. The special effects barely made it watchable.
2,Terrible Actors,Title says it all. With better actors the movie could have been good. Nice effects but that was about it.
1,Why?,"This movie was horrible. I love mindless action as much as the next guy but damn. If Michael Bay were dead he would be rolling over in his grave. The story is non-existent. Acting is bad. Directing was all over the place. People keep making comparisons to transformers, but I do not think this is a fair comparison for transformers. It at least has a antagonist who talks throughout the movie and has an agenda. The invaders here have no real motivation and never speak or even make you dislike them at all. Save you money and watch an Armageddon rerun. It is a masterpiece of mindless action. This movie is just a piece of ____."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"This movie was horrible. Horrible acting, horrible plot, horrible script. The film was obviously made to be a recruitment tool for the Navy, which may be fine if all the Navy wants to attract are mindless idiots."
4,I was prepared to hate this movie but did not.,"I was prepared to hate this movie but did not. The Transformers movies were so bad and made no sense what so ever I thought surely Mike Bay would do this movie the same and well actually is also makes no sense what so ever. The characters are likeable though unlike the Transformers. I liked everyone. I give stars based on five things directing (no star), acting (star), writing (star), effects (star), costume and make up (star). So everything was good save the director so it's worth seeing. Spoiler: True there is no way aliens who can fold time and space would arrive here with a stupid sat tracking system like ours and be dead in the water literally. I think if the aliens were less high tech and they were given an objective like ""We need your water"" it would have been better."
3,GOOD MOVIE,"THE BLU-RAY IS GREAT, MOVIE IS A LITTLE OUT THERE. I DIDN'T THINK A BATTLE IN MORTH BALLS FOR YEARS COULD GO INTO BATTLE AND HAVE EVERYTHING WORK THE WAY THIS ONE DID"
4,Popcorn Movie,"Enjoyable popcorn movie. A little corny at times (It is based on a board game), but has decent rewatchability. Best watched with a decent home entertainment system."
3,not.even close to the game,"Not even close to the game. There is no way to touch on what the game was about so not to offend anyone or any country. But as far as the plot goes, and acting, special effects it was a very enjoyable action packed movie.I'm looking forward to a sequel. It should be as enjoyable."
2,Disappointing Battleship,"After listening to all the hype thrown at the general public from television promotions I expected much more. I found the story line to be disjointed and without believable continuity. Anyone who has knowledge of any warship decommissioned and now serving as a museum knows all major mechanical parts have been disassembled, the 16"" guns have been permanently plugged and all ammunition has been removed long ago.Also the aliens had placed a force field around their position, only the three guided missile ships inside the field where able to engage the aliens. Yet the Missouri was able to engage the aliens when it was not inside the shielded area before the force field was dropped.There were many more inconsistencies which combined gave me a very disappointing viewing experience."
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed with this film. When I saw Liam Neeson starred in it I thought I couldn't go wrong but he really did not have a starring role. It had good special effects and alot of action but I just didn't think it was worth buying. I regret my purchase and I am a sci-fi/horror/war/action flick fan!
4,I've been Decked!,"Great movie, especially in HD! Another added bonus is seeing the beautiful Brooklyn Decker on film. She is one of the most beautiful models ever! The movie is far fetched but a great visual experience."
3,Battleship,This was a Christmas gift for my son. He had asked for this movie. After watching it he said it was not a very good movie.
3,B movie,"If you like kitchy, B sci-fi, as I do, you will be able to sit through this movie. If you want high brow, sci-fi, you will hate this."
4,Underrated movie,"If you have liked Taylor Kitsch in Wolverine, you will like him here as well. Battleship is a fun movie with good puns, an unbelievable storyline (that makes it so worth watching), adventure, redemption. It's not a big role, and certainly not his best, but Liam Neeson still delivers. I was surprised how much I enjoyed Rihanna. She is feisty, cocky, delivers her lines with aplomb. I suggest to give it a try after a long week on the job and a weekend evening to relax with a glass of wine."
2,Lots of action but little substance.,"There are too many loose ends in this plot and too many stereotypical characters to put it in a ""great si fi"" category. Troubled kid brother joins Navy to follow his older sibling who (of course) gets killed by invading aliens that look disconcertingly like Old order Amish sporting porcupine beards! And speaking of Navy, clearly that service had a hand In the production....probably a recruiting ploy. Seems the Blue Water Navy saved the world all by itself. hoo-raa!"
5,Good Movie!,"I am not a movie critic but if you like SciFi you will enjoy this movie. It is like a combination of TopGun ( top Ship ),Alien and Transformers all in one movie. Any military movie fans or Navy fans will enjoy this flick too!"
3,good enough for a rental,but glad I didn't go a theater to watch. lots of action. plot makes little logical sense. (how do you get a mothballed battleship into battle in less than a day?)
3,Slow Moving At The Start,I'm not a movie critic but I love Syfy movies. This movie is very slow at the start and the acting is just okay.
4,Good Movie,"Been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd full of action and sci fi action, very good movie"
4,Good Flick,"While this film was not what I expected, it was enjoyable nonetheless. It was good enough to rent after first seeing it in the theatre."
3,Seriously? You want me to write about this?,Pretty decent Navy versus Aliens movie if you put your brain on hold and just enjoy it. la la la
4,pretty good,"I actually liked this flick. It is pure entertainment value, but Taylor Kitsch dies a good job. Brooklyn Decker is not only hot, but also puts in a credible performance. I like the fact that the Navy fights aliens in the ocean, I think it adds a bit of credibility to a story that requires suspension of reality. Overall, very entertaining. I saw this movie a few times before purchasing. I liked it enough to watch it over and over.again."
3,Very Entertaining,"This movie was a lot better than I expected. The plot or story line was plausible and gave way to actually happening. The acting......well, it was entertaining."
1,Awful,"I like action movies, but this was almost unbearable. Terribly written, cheesily acted, an almost complete waste of time, don't waste your money!"
5,Awesome Story! Great for Families!,"My family absolutely loves this movie! Our favorite part has to do with the chicken burrito (although there are a lot of other good parts, too). Those who have watched this movie will know what I mean. Since we got it, we have watched it at least 5 times. We love to watch it and then back it up to see certain parts. Of course, then we forget to push stop and end up watching it to the end (again!), but we don't really mind. I think one of the best parts about this film is the lack of cuss words in it. They get close one or two times but they never finish it. Basically, a ""feel good,"" action movie with a nice-paced plot and a good ending. Great for kids!"
3,What do you expect from a movie based on a board game.,"Pretty much what you could expect from a board game. An ""ok"", Hollywood fluff piece about aliens and a battleship, the Mighty Mo. Interesting that only the old guys who actually sailed her knew anything about running her. Kinda says something about modern warfare and the ""pinball"" fleets (or at least Hollywood's appraisal of them. ""Ready to play with the big boys."") Nice ""popcorn on a rainy Saturday night when all TV is a rerun"" kind of movie. Think Battlestar Galactica's pilot on the water."
3,Aliens vs the U.S. Navy,This movie is very entertaining with good special effects. I believe the acting gets a passable grade but could have been better. I believe this movie flopped at the box office because it came out a week after The Avengers. I feel if they waited a little while longer then maybe it would have done better. This movie is good but there are far better ones to choose from.
4,Battleship Review,The movie had action and a little suspense. It had good graphics and held the interest of my 15 and 18 year old. There was a little cussing in it but overall not bad.
1,"Horrible movie, only worth watching if you enjoy laughing at bad movies.","I knew the reviews were bad, but we still have it a shot. The movie is SO bad, the plot is so ludicrous, the characters as cliche as they could be. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I fee appalled that I literally WASTED 2 hours of my life watching this."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Waste of time and money. I tried watching this movie, but it sucked, should of known that a movie with Rihana should suck."
1,Battleship,"I ordered this movie on DVD and got to watch it for free on Amazon video. This has to be the dumbest movie ever put on film. Nothing about Battleship is the least bit intelligent. BE warned,,,,,you not only must suspend belief but be totally brain dead as well....Watch it but save your cash and don't purchase. Some one in my family will be getting a dud for Christmas....Tom"
1,I should have listened to the reviews.,"99% of Hollywood producers are competent and committed. The remainder made this movie. Seriously, was this movie part of some science experiment to see if people would groan themselves to death?"
1,PHLTTT,"This movie sucked. Big-time. Bad acting, stupid plot, and I think it is a little interesting that Hollywood always makes Aliens male and evil. Seriously, have you no imagination out there in tinsel town or has all that smog affected you ability to think in a creative, intelligent and entertaining manner. I think it has."
1,Sucks big time,"this movie sucks so bad I would not subject the most enthusiastic sci-fi fan it to, it really sucks on all levels, that must 20 words, but the only one that counts is it SUCKS."
2,This one Sunk,"This movie is bad. The script, acting, editing, and cinematography were all awful. I get the idea of bringing the board game into it, but it's way out of the box and totally unbelievable. The only points it gets is for some of the special effects (I almost believed some of what was on the screen). But just as soon as I get into it, Some bad editing ruins the moment. 1.7/5 Stars. Don't waste your time (unless you really love Rihanna)."
3,Cookie cutter action movie mixed with a little sci-fi,"Battleship is an ok movie if you have nothing better to do. Don't expect much, but it is worth watching. It is just another movie where the loser (but the film throws in a couple things so you know he can do better) proves that he can save the day and gets the girl. Do expect a plot or everything to make logical sense, just realize you are watching it because nothing better is available."
2,Boringly inaccurate CGI fest that's not worth your time.,"Lots of action, not all that much plot. Most of the story line gets lost within what action sequences that take up the majority of the film. Originality is definitely lost in the beginning of the movie where an actual youtube video of a guy breaking into a store is ""remade"" into comedic relief for this flick. I couldn't believe it. Shot for shot, frame for frame. I hope the criminal who suffered through the original robbery actually got some money put on his books for it. Or perhaps the convenience store that first posted the video got some sort of royalty. I highly doubt it. This movie is also considerably inaccurate about shipboard situations and how sailors actually react in the Navy. But then, It's a movie. You only need 3 people and a couple extras to simulate a ship run by hundreds of people on a daily basis in a movie. Right?"
3,OK for it's type,Really 2 and 1/2 stars but I have it a bit of extra credit. Enjoyable and entertaining with lots of funny bits thrown in. Special effects were good. It was diverting.
4,ACTION packed..!!!!,"...in the genre of hostile-alien-earth-invasion flicks, this one ranks in the top five...!!...the special effects were top-notch and the futuristic alien weaponry was very believable and not as far-fetched as most Hollywood productions go...my ONLY complaint was the very little screen time that was afforded Liam Neesom, as he is a truly powerful screen presence, and I thought he'd have a bigger role defending us from the newest crop of humanoid oppressors.GREAT flick...!!!"
1,Battleship,This was so an awful movie! I was really hoping to like it seeing as it was filmed in Pearl Harbor where I'm stationed in US Navy but it was just too outlandish to go with. I can handle the fantasy part of it but they really didn't research the minute details of what goes on in the Navy. Hey at least my 8 year old liked it!
4,fun thrill ride.,"Very well done. A different take on an alien invasion, with a solid mix of action and story. Characters are fun and tough. Really good movie."
2,Battleship,So many cliches...so much time. Special effects were quite good. WWII vets added more substance than the actors. A fairly entertaining waste of time.
3,"Great Special Effects, But Storyline We've All Heard Before","I was in the mood for a special effects sci-fi, and this fit the bill perfectly. It's a fun movie, lots of special effects. But don't look for any unique story here. It's largely a re-telling of the same plot from many other similar movies that came before."
1,Battleship,The movie was good but I was unable to view the whole movie as it took forever to download the movie.This was my first movie on the kindle so maybe it was a user problem but I don't think so.My one star does not the reflect the quality of the movie but rather the quality of the kindle
4,very entertaining,"As a Navy veteran i enjoyed the naval aspects of this movie. The Sci-Fi portion was also great. Very intense and ""edge of the seat"" action. Only complaint is the aliens destroyed two of the three main turrets on the Mighty Mo but after that scene, she was still using two of her main turrets! Minor, I know."
1,a little too late,"Maybe if this movie came out during the 90's it would have been big. Rihanna made this movie even worse off than it already was. Not all the star power could save this one. maybe if they let the aliens win, it would have been good"
3,An eye roller for sure.,"I know, I know. What did I expect when the movie is about aliens? Actually the aliens are pretty cool and the way the military guys figured out a way to deal with them is pretty cool as far as science fiction goes. There are just too many cliches though. ""Top Gun"" over-dramatized sequences are frequent. My wife and I looked at each other and rolled our eyes too many times to give this one more than a three star rating. I think any movie gets three stars if you can stand to watch it all the way through and we did. We survived the attack, but barely!"
4,Better than expected.,"Feelgood movie with good special effects. Predictable movie, but good acting, directing, kept the movie interesting. Would recommend, watch the trailer and then you will want to rent it."
3,Action packed but dumb,"I actually liked the special effects and the sci fi action in this movie... But there were so many little items that made no sense, that I couldn't rate it any higher. Really? The aliens flew across the galaxy to get here, but their ships can only ""hop"" 500 feet? Dumb."
3,Not bad,"This movie wasn't bad. I enjoyed the action and the acting while not Oscar worthy also wasn't bad. It did a good job of ""playing"" battleship in the fight scenes. Overall I'd say this movie is worth watching, but unles you fall in love with it, don't buy it."
3,Good Potential,I guess my biggest mistake was to expect too much. I thought it was ok. Probably worth more as a $1 redbox charge than an Amazon fee of $3.99. There was too much focus on the main characters temper and love interests. Don't get me wrong I know that have to stick some girl in everything but it took away from movie.
5,Great Movie!,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I'm one of those people who makes up my own mind and doesn't rely on critic's reviews. I went to the movies to see this because I like Taylor Kitsch, who plays the main character. He was on Friday Night Lights. It also stars Liam Neeson. With those 2 guys, how can you go wrong?This movie made me laugh, cry and kept me on the end of my seat. As soon as I left the theater I knew I was going to purchase the movie. Watch it with no other thought than to have a good time. You'll like it!"
5,Great PG13 movie for family movie night,"Good movie for family movie night for 3 generations. SPOILER ALERT: LOVED the honoring of the WWII Veterans to help fight in the movie. If you like stuff blowing up, the good guys winning, & the boy getting the girl...all with minimal 4 letter words...then you'll enjoy this movie."
3,Surprisingly Fun,"As a rule, I'm generally leery of movies based on games (either the board or the video variety). With that said, I decided to take a chance with Battleship and I dont regret it. Oh sure, the acting is nothing special, the premise is waaaay out there and without giving spoilers, the climatic battle is frankly silly. But, with all that said, if you need a relentlessly pro-USA, pro-military show, put this on your Roku watch list right next to Battle Las Angeles and indulge in some mindless fun. It's better than mowing the lawn."
3,Entertaining,"Battleship was entertaining at best. The CGI was a lttle over the top, and the love scenes between Hopper and Sam were detractions from the main plot of the movie. It was like there were two plots to the story, the invasion of the folks from outerspace, and the puppy dog love / lust affair between San and Hopper. The moview suffered because of the inherent conflict between these two primary plots.A"
3,Don't abandon ship just yet,"I found this movie Battleship to be an awesome adventure, with syfy bad guys. The trailers were a bit miss leading when it comes to actor Liam Neeson. He is not in the movie a lot. It gets a little long in the middle but hang in there the ending is worth it. The ending though worth it is far fetched to think it would really work out that way. However the music is classic rock and just the thought is cool. My family truly enjoyed this movie. If you don't try to pick it apart and remember everything goes in the movies you'll like it just fine."
2,No script bad acting...,Many times I wonder why Hollywood keeps on making extremely bad movies at a major rate. I guess is just the assembly line mentality...
2,just bad script and acting,"Nice graphics but really bad acting and script. Really unbelievable and I love sci-fi so it's really hard for me to be disappointed. Well I was disappointed. I had to remind myself that this was not a b movie, but an expensive Hollywood production that just really stunk!"
3,good action film especially if you like transformers,This film has great action sequences and effects. Decent story line with good and good looking actors/actresses. Pretty good movie.
2,"Battleship is decent, not great.","I have always enjoyed Neeson's characters. If it wasn't for him this movie would get 1 star. Formula ""screw off officer"" evolving into a ""hero"" is just too overused. I even skipped some of this. Give us some more intellect please."
3,Filled a time gap,"The special effects were good...however, the story itself was pretty plain. No real plot line, nothing cohesive or new, simply a handful of rehashed story concepts smashed together with some good effects to hold your attention. There were even portions in the movie that to me (a sci-fi fan) didn't make sense. Aliens travel the galaxy to dominate earth...and their spacecraft has to ""hop"" around the ocean? Yeah...kind of a leap. ;P"
4,Good action movie,If you liked Transformers you will like Battleship. The movie is very action packed and is well done. The only thing that would have made this a better movie would have been to have it in 3D.It did not do well when it came out and I am not sure why. It is a good movie.
4,Battleship,"Good SciFi movie, liked the story line and action scenes, would tell other folks to see it.It is something worth renting on a weekend night."
2,Disappointing,"This film should not have been made. The story is laughable, derivative and falls flat on its face. The two redeeming features were watching Rihanna and the (presumably) CGI Battleship. This film tries to be a summer blockbuster exploiting the proven formula of predecessors such as ""Independence Day"". However where Independence Day had a witty and at times quite clever script along with over-the-top acting, memorable characters and outrageous CGI, Battleships had none of these attributes. It is plain stupid. Liam Neeson, who is an entirely believable Command figure, is completely wasted in this miserable production. I did like Rihanna but I really can't say she was given an opportunity to prove her acting abilities. I do hope we see her in more films. Message to Hollywood. You need to cast your net wider for engaging stories, and stop poaching the talentless writers from the SyFy cable channel."
2,Corney plot. Alien space ships are rediculous.,It took 6 hours to download this movie to my TiVo. I couldnt watch it when I wanted to and the movie had an amateurish plot. The alien spaceships are some combination of snake and alligator that jump through water like a dog trying to swim.
4,Best visual effects since the Transformers franchise,"OK, I'll fess up, I'm a big fan of movies with stunning visual effects, almost to the point of forgiving a cruddy plot and low-budget acting. I thought Battleship might be one of those that needed a lot of forgiving. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The story line was engaging and the actors brought believability to a very fantastic premiss, particularly surprising given the thin acting credentials of some of the main characters. Over all, a great 2-hour escape with solid acting and superb production values. We streamed it first, and liked it so much that we bought it and watched it again two nights later."
4,Great action movie,"Loved this movie. Great story line, excellent special effects and pretty decent acting. Beats the pants off Transformers 3. Made me want to join the Navy and hunt aliens!"
1,Save your money and your mind from going to mush!,"Cannot believed how much this movie sucked! The best part of the movie (spoiler alert) is when the retired navy came and helped saved the day. Seriously, I tuned this movie out until it got to the end when it became more interesting and I put down my Kindle. When the credits rolled, I couldn't help but think... so glad I didn't go to the theatre to see this major disappointment."
2,Crap!,Great special effects and a horrible story line! This movie was terrible and I want my money back plus more for pain and suffering!
2,Unrealistic - kinda stooopid plot.,The subject matter & plot seemed to me to be very un-plausable. Kinda silly & will likely give the dvd to someone who might appreciate the science fiction genre.
3,I watch it for research on potential Alien invasion,For the record the Hawaiian Islands need a force field if just for all the garbage they get from the mainland. In other news did you see Alex Skargaard's O face that was a punt photo shot and well...really storylines for board games have we learned nothing from Robin Williams in Jumanji
3,It was a fun movie to watch. Wouldn't buy it.,But it was fun. Reminded me of Transformers. But I enjoyed it as sort of a sunday mind numbing lay on the couch and watch movie.
5,AWESOME,"This is the best movie of 2012 I have seen! Absolutely great acting, great action, comedy, romance- everyone fromkids, women, men and grandparents will love this movie! I recommend it for EVERYONE!"
2,Decent special effects. Terrible acting and non-sensible scenarios,"Really wanted to like this one. Was willing to over look some silly things. However, without giving away the story, the scenarios are so completely unrealistic as far as the personal relationships, how the Navy works, and just common sense. It just ruins it. Everything Taylor Kitsch touches since Friday Night Lights seems to be just awful - John Carter anyone?Clearly the movie was not reviewed for any concept of common sense. Even Liam Neeson couldn't keep the stink away from this movie. A little bit more effort they might have had a decent movie. Wait until it hits the dollar bin at Wal-Mart."
2,Another sci-fi movie that fails to deliver.,"Really, aliens who fly all the way here to destroy us will be much better at it, again. Everything in this movie is only OK. As a whole it adds up to less than OK. Just kind of a waste of time."
3,Alright.,"Was not what I expected. The graphics and special effects were really good, but it was missing something. Maybe it was missing some good actors. I don't know, maybe it's just me."
3,Entertaining Summer Action Flick,"This movie follows in the tradition of all of the Micheal Bay/Jerry Bruckhiemer films. It is loud, action packed, silly at times, and is made to be a bit of a feel good film. Battleship isn't deep and engaging. It's just a series of CGI shots thrown together. It is a wonderfully shot film. A whole lot of money went into the cameras and special effects. For some reason, Liam Neeson is in this film and although he's just collecting a paycheck, he still does an amazing job at delivering lines. If you are looking for something dumb and fun to watch, give this a try. The Avengers comes out less than 2 weeks from this review, so know that Marvel's The Avengers is the superior film by far, but if you can't wait and need something this instant, this isn't too bad."
5,unbelievable but good fun entertainment,it may not be up to transformer level - but if you like Transformers type movies then you should like this.leave behind that any of this makes sense - it's actually pretty entertaining.
3,A bit far fetched but good movie to watch,"I have to admit when I saw the trailer for Battleship - I thought it was all about the alien race is going to kick some serious butt and we don't have the technology to stop them but somehow we managed to steal the ship and turn it against them. Unfortunately this wasn't the case but why this movie was far fetched is any of our weapons like the shells or missiles from our ships wouldn't be able to dent much of a large alien ship like this.Overall the movie is good to watch, average acting but nice special effects"
2,Not very good,"enjoyable enough to watch, but set your expectations low. A few cool scenes, but for the most part this was a fairly lame film."
2,Good Visuals .... And Nothing Else,"I gave this 2 stars because it is pretty to look at. Other than that, expect a litany of cheeseball one-liners, a whole lot of predictability, and ridiculous acting. As far as the plot goes, this movie offers you everything you've likely seen many times before. There was no real attempt to give you anything new in that development. I'll admit I didn't expect much from Rihanna branching out into acting, but it was still a little disappointing I just couldn't help it. She didn't offer anything to the movie by her being there other than throwing her out there like 'Here, have Rihanna.' And if her role had been entirely removed from the script there wouldn't be a hole left behind.Don't expect there to be any memorable characters in this movie, but in the fashion of Transformers, if you enjoy CG explosions and little else, some parts of this you're bound to find entertaining."
5,loved it,"good cast, good story, great effects. the extras needed some work though... ... ... .... .... ... ... .."
5,Battleship,"Great story. A handicapped veteran as a hero was a great touch. Being from Missouri had me cheering the ""Deus ex machina"" as she saved the day. Can't wait to see it again."
3,sandmansays,If your a fan of the transformers trilogy then this movie is for you. There is alot of action and descent story.
4,Bam,Moves fast. Fun. Action packed. Rihanna is better than I expected. Lots of action. Other worldly fun. Will there be Battleship 2?
4,Entertaining and Unbelievable,"This movie's special effects looked pretty good and really made the film. But if you are looking for much depth of plot beyond that, you won't get it here. Being a science fiction author,Lucifer's Pocket, I do understand that there is a certain amount of suspending one's disbelief required to make a plot work. Being a Navy veteran, and having written about battleships,Vengeance: Hatred and Honor, I have an understanding of what it takes to operate a ship. This film not only strained my suspending of disbelief, it broke right past it with no resistance at all. It's almost a better comedy than an action movie and I think it was intended that way. Nonetheless it was entertaining enough in that capacity that I had to watch it twice.If you are looking for lighthearted action entertainment this movie is for you. If you are looking for action with a realistic plot--move on, you won't find it here."
5,Goes back to old Sci-fi fun!!!!!,"This movie is just fun to watch. Yes, there is a lot of logic left at the door but this movie isn't about that, it reminds me of old Will Smith 4th of july movies that were just meant for fun.THIS IS AN ALIEN INVADES THE WORLD MOVIE!!! for all of you that don't understand what that means and actually think there now has to be every piece of logic explained to you.This was a fun watch and a good time. Simple yet spectacular.If you liked Independence day, John Carter, and #1 or #3 of Transformers. You will like this movie.But please don't walk into it with a bunch of questions.....just enjoy the ride."
2,Brooklyn Decker's breasts...and some human vs alien stuff,"Plot? nope. Character development? nope. Things blowing up? yep.Willing suspension of disbelief is severely tested in this one. Aliens are basically the same as the aliens in Independence Day, albeit a little less goopy. One scene featuring a captured alien is pretty much stolen from ID:4. The Mighty Mo still has live ordnance on board??One redeeming quality: Every time Brooklyn Decker runs, it seems the camera angle changes to get a bouncy cleavage shot.overall an amusing 2hr diversion, provided you don't have high expectations."
2,Good Special Effects - The Plot was awful,"The special effects were excellent and that is why I gave it 2 stars, however, the scenario was completely unbelievable.1. Burglarize a convenience store, get tazed by the cops for running from the scene...2. then, at the request of your brother <who just happens to be a Ship's Commanding Office> become a twice promoted naval officer...with a felony burglary on his record.Oh, did I mention the reason he broke into the Convenience Store?? He met a pretty girl in a bar who wanted a chicken burrito...Oh, I almost forgot, her Daddy just happened to be a 3 star Admiral.I have seen better plots in a Saturday morning cartoon."
4,Had a good time watching,"I read some of the reviews and expected this to suck. I watched the movie and found myself cheering at the end and happy I watched it. Forget what others say, who cares if the aliens lose in the end...shit they are supposed to!"
1,The board game sees more action,Title almost says it all. Some bad movies are real bad. This I must say makes my #1 bad of all time. How did this crap even make screen...
2,Extremely disappointed,The beginning of this movie had to much time trying to build the characters up. I almost got to the point of just turning it off. Even when the aliens started attacking I was still not into it. Finally the climax was getting closer and I really REALLY! enjoyed the last battle. But then the ending was to overdone as well. I feel like everyone was just trying too hard in this movie. After hearing all my friends tell me how good it was I'm very disappointed.
2,This Movie is Terrible,"I ended up watching this during a plane ride that never ended and good god was it horrible. The premise, the plot holes, the lack of scientific accuracy, it all burns so much.2 stars only because that blond chick was hot and the graphics were okay I guess."
5,battleship,"Movie had a good story, well developed characters, and excellent special effects. Visitors who have watched this movie have commented positively, also."
3,Taylor Kitsch Is Awful!,"The story and the special effects were all there, but Taylor Kitsch ruined it for me. I'm just not a fan of his acting and I think the movie would have been much better if he wasn't in it. I did like the aliens and the action ... and pretty much everything else about the movie. Even Rihanna's character was well acted and convincing. Oh well, not a total loss. The alien aspect was still cool."
4,"Really, really good","It's a lot of fun to watch and producers, director and actors went all the way out. CGI effects were incredibly good. The fact that war veterans were casted made the movie something not only very patriotic but also unforgettable. The scenes filmed on the Missouri were awesome and the veterans stole the action.I wish the producers had taken things seriously, forgetting the stupid pranks and touches of goofy humor. Otherwise, it's an excellent movie. And the blonde is intelligent and knows how to act and is real eye candy.I'm looking forward to ""Battleship 2..."""
3,Meh,"It wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but very forgettable. The best part was that the alien bombs looked like the pegs from the Battleship game. Other than that, full of holes, cliches, and bad acting. On the upside, plenty of action. And finally, an alien movie where the aliens don't have tentacles! Gotta give it props for that."
4,Much Better Than Expected!,"Playing the game Battleship, as a child, I never thought of an alien enemy. Thought provoking concept, and done very well in this 'game gone movie' flick. Even with the length of the movie, I think that quite a bit more should have been used to explain the nature of the aliens. Maybe we could have learned more about the history of the enemy. All in all, if you can turn off your 'that could never happen' attitude for 2 hours and 12 minutes, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The CGI was excellent, and the acting was just as cool. I really kind of have hopes for a sequel!"
4,Why the Bad Rep?,"I don't know why this movie got such bad reviews. I liked it. It was exciting, had great effects, the acting was good too. Not to mention the cast!!! Liam Neeson can do no wrong in my book!!"
1,Horrible,"This movie was beyond horrible, the only real actor was Jesse Plemons. He should have played the lead role. What a complete waste of money, and how embarassing to have Rihanna act."
5,BATTLESHIP,NOT A BLOCKBUSTER BUT VERY ENTERTAINING IT HAS A LITTLE COMEDY A LITTLE ACTION AND SOME GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS PUT IT ALL TOGETHER YOU HAVE SOME GOOD ENTERTAINMENT
1,Worst movie I seen this year!,From start to end the movie is the worst I seen so far this year! How is it possible to make movies like this?! There should be a law against these kind of movies.
3,Battlewagon,A fair job on a great topic. Nice ideas to make it more realistic with older vets. A fair job on a great topic. Nice ideas to make it more realistic with older vets.
2,JUST NOT A GOOD MOVIE,"I did not have very high hopes when I rented this film from the local Major Movie Rental Chain Store. What was I expecting, this is a movie ""inspired"" by a board game that I played when I was a kid back in 1978. My primary mode of transportation back in those days was a Schwinn Stingray. I really tried to like this movie. The action sequences were very well done and the special effects are FLAWLESS. Especially the scenes where the CGI Battleship U.S.S. Missouri fires on the alien Mothership. However, the cliched hero, the hopeless dialogue and the typical stock characters just made this a bad Transformers rip off."
3,Just to have some time spend,"Just to have some time spend, some action, good efects, not the best movie. Also need to tell that the efects are really similar to transformers, already know that whas the same software, but didnt like this movie is not original in that."
4,Battleship,"We were extremely diassapointed, the movie lost connection numerous times and we had to keep reseting. It took us over 3 hrs. to watch. We also have Netflix and do not have this problem. I will rent another time but if I have the conection problem again I want order from Amazon again. We lost numerous parts of the movie trying to reconnect."
2,So bad...It's good,"This movie may well become a cult classic. I watched- no endured it, and then found myself talking about it for the next week.The first 15 minutes were genuinely funny, I completely enjoyed the beginning of the movie, but as it continued, I was amazed at just how bad it got.The acting was so bad, that they should give Oscar's to the actors for their impersonation of actors.The scene where the disabled vet asks the girlfriend, ""How good are your driving skills?"" made me laugh out loud for days, but I don't think it was meant to be funny.And, Rhianna just wasn't credible as a military weapons specialist...But having said all of that, I am now thinking I should watch it again... and I will say that the SFX were definitely impressive, but as a previous reviewer said, you can't allow yourself to think when watching this movie, or it will most definitely ruin any possibilty for enjoyment."
4,Battleship,I liked it when they got the USS Missouri out to finish the job! Big battleship ship!Hard to beat that ship down and when the old timers from ww2 jumped in it was great!
3,Pretty good movie.,"It's not a moving, patriotic military themed film. But it is an action-packed, military-themed sci-fi thriller. As long as you aren't a Surface Warfare Officer in the United States Navy, you will probably enjoy the action pace and climactic sequences. If you are a SWO, then probably rent it rather than own it. You will be frustrated with the technical innaccuracies potrayed in the way that a surface ship and the Navy as a whole operates."
3,Not as bad as the ratings say,"If you like war pictures and a little bunch of dum aliens this is the picture for you. Alot of action and GUESS who wins. Good special effects, acting not to bad either. Worth the price and don't forget the making of part."
3,"Not bad for Hasbro, whatever that means.",Good actors and interesting action scenes. It could have been half as long and I would have given it more stars. It seemed to carry the same medium level of action throughout the whole thing. No real highs or lows.
4,Surpassed expectations!,"Watched so hubby could have a ""guy"" movie. I think I almost liked it better than him! He liked it too, but I was surprised at how much I did!"
4,Fun,Yea its science fiction Had good fx and a pretty good story and kept me watching I liked it. Maybe not for everyone
3,"Ok story Plot, descent action","Ok story Plot, descent action, the aliens could have been better designed with their makeup, but the super advanced alien never gets old."
4,good movie,"the movie is real good the dvd was in real good shape,the case was in good shape as well. thank you so much you will be hearing from me soon."
4,Battleship,"Great plot, great actors,.... well put togather,...except for being a little predictable. Would i seeit again? yes i wouldThat is why i bought a copy!! Be careful of who you call here or from where???"
3,Seriously?,Well it has good special effects.Do you seriously believe maybe 10 guys are going to get a WWII Battleship out of what ever shape it was supposedly in and actually get it underway? And it has live ordnance on board to boot!They couldn't do that even if the ship was 100% ready for sea. Fracking impossible.Whatever... Total fantasy..
3,Loser saves the world again,OK movie but predictable. Decent action and Special Effects. The loser has the required skills but the wrong attitude until the big bad aliens wake him up.
3,If there is nothing else to watch ...,"If plot isn't a concern and you can FULLY suspend your disbelief ... go ahead, watch it!If you're hair requires washing, and you don't want to deal with obnoxious lead actors, timelines that don't compute, and extremely poor transitioning between scenes, you should probably just concentrate on hygiene rather than risk wasting your time."
2,Wasted talent,"Loud, flashy, expensive, interesting, but not worthy of the talent. Liam Neeson didn't need this in his back pocket. And the lesson learned? If you are the lazy, spoiled brat, you live and succeed while your perfect, well behaved, sacrificing brother bites the dust!"
4,Bad Reviews???,"I was talking to some people at work about this movie. They all initially wanted to see it, but were wary because of bad reviews. I think the pro reviewers missed the mark on this one. I found the movie to be thoroughly entertaining. It was even interesting to watch the tactics of the US Navy. It was definitely a shoot-em-up raw action thriller on one hand, but also, even a little deeper than that."
5,Loved It,"Two thumbs up. My husband is in the Navy, soBattleshipwas a movie we wanted to see for the ships if nothing else. We missed it on the big screen (cue the screaming baby), so were eager for the video. To our surprise, it was much better than we expected from the previews. The plot is pretty good. Great action, although it does get a little Transformers-esque over the top a few times. Fun characters with enjoyable dialogue, which for me is what makes a show. We liked it enough that we rented it a second time to watch with friends. If you like Sci-Fi action with some jokes, this is for you.As a warning, while waiting for Battleship I rentedAmerican Warships. It is a bootleg version of the same plot (using a WWII museum ship to fight aliens) but with cheesy acting and almost no special effects budget. I would only recommend it if you enjoy MST3K-ing movies. In that case, American Warships is a prime candidate."
2,Transformers in the ocean,"Battleship is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It is true entertainment. Don't look for any depth in the plot or characters; don't have any expectations that this movie will have a profound affect on your philosophies of life! The action is fast and the machines are impressive - if you like Transformers! If you are looking for a Good Friday or Saturday night movie that you don't have to put a lot of thought or emotion into, but that will keep your attention, this is it."
5,AMAZING*******GO NAVY !!!!!!,"This movie is not only exciting but real Navy ships and Navy personnel are used. The USS Missouri was taken out of dock where it had been parked for past 20 years!!! I have visited Hawaii and Pearl Harbor,it is a very moving experience. In the movie the American and Japanese Naval officers work together to defeat this new enemy. The special effects will knock you off your feet."
3,Battleship Review,"Though no masterpiece, this movie was not that bad. I would not have paid to see it in the theatre, but good diversion nonetheless."
2,Not bad for what it is,"I can understand why this movie did not remain in theaters long. It had some excitement, but not enough to sustain my interest and it was a little silly in parts. But with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday afternoon, it may be just the thing."
3,Worth watching once,"Not what I was expecting but it was entertaining. If you have time to kill, this movie does the job."
2,Miscast,"This movie would have been watchable if I hadn't kept uttering, ""are you kidding me?"" every time I saw Rihanna. Totally miscast; in fact, had to be cast in this role only to bring in a demographic which made matters worse. To future Directors and Producers: let pop stars be pop stars, let actors/actresses make movies."
4,Great Sci-Fi and humor,"I watched it with my 10-year-old son and we both love it. It's got all elements of a great Sci-Fi movie: impressive scenes, good plot, good acting, plus some humor."
2,Battleship,Could have been better - there was really no continuity or action till the end. The storyline was uninspiring until they brought the Vets in.
4,"It Won't Win Any Awards, But It Will Entertain Your Socks Off","For a movie that got so much negative press and horrible reviews, I quite enjoyed watching it! Admittedly, the plot and dialogue are formulaic and cheesy at times, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do; entertain. The CGI is truly terrific here and you won't be disappointed if you're looking for a movie that will allow you to shut your brain off for a couple of hours."
5,war,Excellent movie to watch suspencful action filled and just an overall joy to watch will definitely spread the word about this movie doesn't get much better
4,A fun movie . . .,"An entertaining sci-fi action flick, light fare, heavy on special effects, competently acted, with an unexpected plot twist toward the end, and a greatly deserved tip-of-the-hat to real heroes of a bygone age. This movie will not trouble you with vexing moral conundrums or social issues; it's strictly entertainment, and it does its job fairly well. (NOTE: I'd call this a ""guy"" flick. Don't be surprised if your girlfriend gets fidgety halfway through.)All in all I enjoyed it."
5,Battleship,"Much better than I thought it would be. Nothing like Transformer, more like Aliens. Streaming was flawless and purchase was very easy."
3,It's ok,"An ok movie, many plot holes. i wouldn't spend the money to buy this one, but it's worth a rental. I never expect to watch this one again."
1,Base a movie on real life ships but act like physics don't exist,"I didn't have a problem with the actors or actresses but this story really stunk, filled with plot holes you could sail a battleship through."
1,lame,"lame. To much character development in the begging in and not enough action, very slow moving. Should have rented at the REDBOX for a $1!"
2,Transformers?,Seen transformers.... any transformers... this is a low budget version of that... skip it. there was very little here to enjoy or even talk about.boats...Aliens... i think?bad acting!
3,Great action - ok acting,"So - 3 stars for guessing who the weak link is in this movie. Really great action in the story line - but just ok acting - really by just one actor/actress. Again - you get to guess who it is who is somewhat weak. But - still enjoyed the movie. One must be willing to give extra credit to someone who is a ""first"" in acting during this film, but otherwise, enjoyable."
1,"Recruitment Tool, Don't bother.","This is one slick advertisment. I imagine the navy donated a massive amount of time and resources to this project. If you want to be manipulated, watch this film...Come on kids...get out there and die for 'merica. Go fighting Teabags."
3,"Ok, not great","Basically, with movies like this, you want a why? There was no real ""why"", just a ""Yay America!"" (and ""old America"" at that)"
5,Amazing movie...,"Starts out silly but once that younger brother is in the Navy, a multitude of events happen to strenthen his courage and develop cunning and shrewdness as a leader. Great editing and terrific plot. I loved this movie!!"
3,Amazon Instant Videos,"It's a good movie, perfect for streaming. I love Amazon instant videos and the iPad app is amazing! on my smart tv, Roku box and smart bluray players too. Whats cool is that when you buy the movie or TV show for the iPad app it downloads onto the unit so I can view anytime and do not need wifi.I'm a huge tech head and getting away from cable, feeling more at ease with the streaming options especially with current tv programing being saturated with reality shows. YUCK!"
3,"eh, its ok","I liked this film more until this gang supposedly breaks out a retired battleship complete w/ its 85 year old retired crew and loads it full of ammo in the blink of an eye. Then it proceeds to out duel a vastly superior alien ship. Oh and the Robo Cop Alien fight w/ the legless fat black dude in a t-shirt & shorts was a complete joke as well...worth a rental I guess. Not believable...but it is entertainment. Surprised it isn't rated PG as the violence is very light & clean, if you will.Robyn Fenty (aka Rihanna) looks hot dripping wet"
1,"awful movie, a total bomb. would rate no star if i could.","Life is to short to waste on this turkey of a movie. The action was stiff,cgi lacking and the content shallow. Nuff said."
2,Sophomoric and mostly boring special effects. Stick to The Transformer's sagas.,"Can't believe we actually sat thru this dud. No wonder it flopped at the box-office.Wouldn't recommend, unfortunately, the special effects are 20 years behind times.Low budget to be sure."
3,Transformers on the water,"This movie was OK. Action sequences were good but lacked a real story - such as why we were being attacked. Great visual effects, ala Transformers, but no real purpose behind them."
5,Battleship??,"Was this a movie based on the game, or just extreme product placement? Not sure, don't care, still tons of fun."
2,O M G!,"Editing was atrocious, as was the plot, script and directing. SE ok, some ridiculous. BS is a war based game, lets have a war."
3,Not bad,It was entertaining enough. I wouldn't pay money for it but if it were on cable TV I might watch it again if bored.
3,You Sunk....My Brain!,"Tell me how great this screenplay is, Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) steals a burito to impress a hot girl at a bar, gets arrested, is forced to join the Navy by his brother (Alexander Skarsgard) and suddenly has an important role on a battleship. I should mention that he's also immature and starts fights while in the Navy. What could be such the thing to shape him up? Well, an alien attack of course. If he was my only hope during an alien attack, I'd jump overboard.So, why 3 stars? You still get Liam Neeson as a bad ass once again even if he's not shown enough. While a big soldier with no legs up against an alien in a fist fight, actually made me smile. I also loved the old timers who help out during the attack. Have just them against aliens in a sequel, then sign me up! The film is a great example of a guilty pleasure movie. Movies based on boardgames? I can't wait for Operation with Hugh Laurie trying remove an alien from someone's chest..."
1,This boat doesn't float,"I'm a special effects fan. Which can seriously corrupt my value as a reviewer. For special effects I would grant this effort four stars. Fortunately I'm able to overcome my infatuation with the technical aspects of film making. Well, not entirely. On the basis of story, acting and directing, this disaster deserves zero stars. That's being generous. Because of a few very good, imaginative computer-generated visuals, I'll give it one star. Recommendation: Rather than waste time watching the whole film, watch the trailer; it contains all the good bits."
3,It has boats and bombs,"Well, it has many big boats, visitors from space, a beautiful blond, big guns, lots of bombs, even more explosions, lots of slow motion stuff happening, and a handsome hero. What more do you need?"
5,Excellant Movie,"Anyone who enjoys an action type movie will enjoy it. It far exceeded what I was expecting from the normal ""Invading Alien"" sort of movie with a great story and surprise turn of events."
3,battleship review,"After watching this movie, I decided that it must have been written by a 12-year old. So many improbabilities that I can't even begin to count. You don't just join the navy and become an officer at the O-3 level. that takes time. You don't just grab a battle ship and steal it in front of a few hundred people. Any story whether fact or fiction has to be real. this movie was just not real. While somewhat enjoyable until near the end, it just wasn't worth the cost to see it. So, speaking as an old Navy vet, save your money."
3,good watch,"Much like transformers but not as well done or as sexy. Still, fun to watch, especially with surround sound. Potential is there for a sequel."
3,Room 4 Improvements,"Although I liked the movie as a whole, the acting sucked, the movie was disjointed, and Rhianna needs to stick to singing. Be that as it may, the CGI was very cool, alien weapons were different - especially liked the geared gizmos - and the hero gets the girl.Was only mildly worth the extra $$ for 3D."
3,Ok but not great,I really liked the idea for this movie and production/direction effects were great but something was missing from the movie. Not fully captivating.
3,Suspend belief; a good yarn,"This was a good Navy recruiting tool. When watching the movie, suspend belief. However there are some highlights:Navy ships in actionCGI was very good!The Army Colonel was believable. He is a Army vet and suited for the part!Back drop: Hawaii!Suspend belief on ...Getting the USS Missouri underway in an hour (should be a couple of days)Live ammo on the museumA long-haired Irish admiral?However, this is a great Navy recruiting piece. I was entertained; but just go into the movie and suspend belief and enjoy the ride. The aliens are typical. It's almost a mashup between Transformers, Independence Day, and Die Hard.But for home, a good romp."
3,"IMPROBABLE, BUT FUN MOVIE","The holes in the plot were big enough that you could drive a battleship through them (where was the continuity editor?), but all in all was a fun action sci-fi yarn. Enjoy - but rent, don't buy."
3,Just for fun,"It's a perfect popcorn movie. You don't need to think much about the story line and just enjoy a lot of CG and explosions.Main character, Taylor Kisch is a very good looking guy and actually really funny. He can be a next Channing Tatum.Aliens look like those Halo soldiers. My 15 year old son really enjoyed it."
2,disappointed,"It has some action, some very little acting, and not much script. I've really liked Battle - Los Angeles and was hoping for more of the same type of action. You won't really find it here. The action is too far fetched to be anything but laughable...but then, maybe it was supposed to be comedy. I guess I like my action to be just a little more realistic - I mean, come on, get an old battleship commissioned and ready to fight in hours - it would take months if not years. And to run it with a handful of personnel - impossible. The script was 'see-thru', you knew what was going to happen in the movie from the opening scenes. Guess I was just expecting more. Don't expect much and you might like it."
3,Battleship,I was a bit disappointed with the movie. The plot was pretty weak and the ending left me scratching my head as they really did not try to offer any explanations as to what had occured. I will say that the special effects were awesome and maybe that was really just the point of the movie.
4,battleship,"we found this movie to be interesting, the video effects were quite good. A friend of ours had the game pack and told us we would not be disappointed in the movie. Quite right - the actors were great, had fun trying to remember what other parts we had seen them in."
3,Good for Brain Dead Action,"Laughable story-line. Be prepared to suspend all disbelief, especially if you have spent more than a day in the military. Where exactly producers find script writers to pen military based stories is a real mystery. The responsible party was utterly incompetent, did no research, or simply didn't have a clue about life in the Armed Forces. If you can manage to get past that large failing, the action is enjoyable. It takes a long time to get to the good though, the viewer must endure horrible attempts at story-telling and background on the characters. It's difficult to care about the the hero; lovable losers don't come off well when they are portraying commissioned officers, it just doesn't work. Taylor Kitsch, who plays Lieutenant Alex Hopper should seriously consider another line a work. Male modeling, maybe?"
4,Battleship is interesting,"We enjoyed Battleship -- one of the few action movies we didn't go to see. It was full of fun action. However, it was a bit confusing. Spoiler here -- The crew inside the field was able to move quite a bit, but the movie never explained how the field got so large or why other ships were excluded.A good use of WWII veterans made that part of the movie more enjoyable!"
3,"boom, aliens, hotties, etc...","Decent movie, it was entertaining, which is the objective..... i'd watch it again. Plots was somewhat plausible, and there was a decent amount of action, and no blatantly horrible acting or writing."
3,Fun and action-packed,"I really enjoyed this video. Great special effects. It had me on the edge of my seat.However, the plot didn't have much depth and was quite formulaic (although it is a formula I enjoy)."
3,why combo only?,Great movie for those who like this type of films. Just dont like the fact that I was forced to buy a combo pack that included DVD and digital copy. All I wanted was just the Blu-Ray. Came in 1 day on std shipping.
4,Battle Ship,"Great movie the special affects were outstanding, the acting was outstanding the story was impressive and all over terrific movie I hope there will be a second one."
4,Battleship,"Non stop action, combined with humor, makes this a lot of fun to watch. this film has all the right ingredients. When you watch this movie, you are never short of being entertained. I highly recommend this movie for anyone wishing to be awed by the special effects."
3,Not the best,The movie was okay but the idea of using an old warship would have been better if they would have uncapped the guns before taking off to battle.
5,Most fun movie!,"I laughed. I whooped, hollered & cheered. I don't think I had as much fun with a movie since the first Starwars movie. Thoroughly entertaining."
4,A fun movie,"My gal and I watched Battleship and were entertained, which is the whole point of TV! I liked it and so did she. 4 stars."
4,Great video for spirited boys,"Though cheesy in some respects, my boys were captivated by the bountiful array of movie graphics. It is best to watch on a large flat screen with quality sound system to enhance the experience."
1,Sunk My Battleship? More Like It Sunk My Brain!,"What were they thinking making this movie? Were they thinking War Of The Worlds battleship-style cuz they did sure-good job with that! Last I checked, the board game was about ships going to war, not aliens invading Earth(watch transformers 1-3 if you need that appetite sated). When the alien-fighting was happening, honestly it gave me a headache and was making me beg for it to stop.Go ahead and say ""thats just hollywood being realistic"", but to me this was a movie that gave not just fad-based topics like this a bad name, but to movies in general! Sorry, Liam Neeson. This isn't your fault."
3,Could've been better,"Battleship has a very interesting idea but the acting is not as strong one could expect. Liam Nieeson saves this movie no doubt about it from being a disaster. the special effects are good, and the movie has its good moments, but is not the greatest movie you can watch. This is one is for watching at home one afternoon with your friends and have some cookies, just that!"
1,Faux Michael Bay,A poor man's version of a Michael Bay movie (except it's even worse than that). Ineptly directed and yet inexplicably arrogant about its own virtues. A real head scratcher.
3,Not as bad as some reviews would have you believe ... AT ALL,"Not sure why so many people hate on this film so badly; have to admit I wasn't too hyped on a film based on a board game ... but I loved that game growing up, and really like a few of the cast members here, so with incredibly low expectations I started to watch. Maybe that was why I liked it - I went in expecting just mindless entertainment, and on that score this film succeeded (at least to me). Aliens threaten the world, the Navy steps in and gets its ass kicked, and then just before turning tail the Navy gets all pro-American and comes back kicking (ass) and screaming. Shut your brain down, this one isn't that bad (though Rihanna kind of got on my nerves)."
3,It was okay,This movie was just okay. I was hoping for more. Most of the good story points were in the last 15 minutes.
4,Action packed!,"Four stars for action, videography and music. Predictable but fun! Transformers are present. Very much like 2009 Star Trek. I love it when the good guys win, especially the Navy!!!"
1,Only a great choice if you like alot of action and no story.,"My headline pretty much sums it up. I mean I like action films but this one only has action. Oh, and gratuitous shots of big-breasted women.While I saw that some of the reviews of this movie were bad, I figured Liam Neeson is in it so how bad can it be. He usually doesn't pick bad scripts.Boy was I wrong. Without much meaningful dialogue, it was very hard to follow this movie. I did watch it to the end just to give the movie a fair shake. But even at the ending credits I was just left scratching my head. I didn't like Cowboys & Aliens either but at least I could follow the movie.If you're looking for another aliens vs humans aka Independence Day-style, look elsewhere."
4,It really depends what you are looking foor.,This movie is great if you are simply looking for mindless action packed full of special effects adventure movie. This is exactly what I expected and this is what I got. The movie loses its shine once a viewer starts taking it apart. The authors of the movie did not seem to concern themselves too much about laws of physics or other similar boring things (which is fine with me). I went for the movie looking for something that could help relax my overstressed mental functions and the movie did this job well. The special effects were great. I am not going to go into too much detail. But if you watch the trailer you will get an idea what I am talking about.
2,Great effects but so unrealistic that it is absurd. Still entertaining though..,"Most of this movie is predictable. The tie in to the old ""Batlleship"" game toward the end, when they were pot shooting via a number/letter grid was actually pretty cool. Still, I bet $20 that Liam Neson regrets even being involved in this donk film."
4,bobw,"entertaining film. lots of action. i would probably watch it again, after all it's a sci-fi flick not a documentary, so some of the action is pretty unrealistic."
2,Not good,"Plot was very bad.The actors had poor performances. Visual effects were great, but they did not help the movie. Save your money."
1,Dumb Execution With Little To Recommend Finished Product,"The aliens were too anthropomorphized to take seriously, in addition to the massive suspension-of-disbelief conflict about arbitrarily choosing between whom to attack and whom to leave alone. I don't have anything positive to say about this movie, so I'll end this review here."
4,"Rise of the ""B"" movie!","Lets be honest here, the movie is -well- dumb but not the way you might think. Because the studio wanted a wider audience, paying for tickets, they made a key mistake in the PG-13 rating gutting what could have been a really gritty and brutal flick. It had all the makings for a hard R rating but no. That's not what we got so the ""bad guys"" avoided killing people even when they posed a direct threat. It was very bizarre to say the least. The only recourse the director had was to show alien tech destroying human tech and that's the real gem of the movie.Dont get me wrong. The special effects are top notch and the surround sound is equally engaging. I cant wait to get this in my home theater! Just because the movie is dumb, and requires no thought, doesn't mean I didn't like it! I happen to like some ""B"" movies including ""B"" movie #1 ""Battle: L.A.""! It set the standard for ""B"" movies in my eyes.This is more like one big audio/video demo from start to finish..."
2,mindless story,If you enjoy a mindless pointless story then this might be the movie for you. It seemed an awful lot like a transformers type movie. I think that even some of the sound effects were the same. But overall this is just a plain no frills action movie. All common sense was left behind. Sure the acting captain of a ship will leave the bridge to go fight an alien that has boarded a ship.... yeah right... it is just little things like that that ruin movies making them just plain stupid.
1,Huge let down!!!,"Big budget and special effects cannot save what is essentially a poor story.Liam Neeson was completely wasted in this film, and not used as an actor of his caliber should be."
1,battleship,"The special effects were pretty good, but you had to suspend reality more than I can even do. Having live ammo on the Mighty MO was almost more than I could bare, but when they dropped the anchor and put her in a power slide I had to let fly some profanities and leave the room. I wish I had seen this movie before I wasted my money on buying it."
1,This was the worst,"The main character was a boor with impulse control issues and the IQ of a walnut. The rest of his crew was not much better. His girl had to be a moron to feel he was worth marrying. The only one worth watching died, Erik Skarsgard. If you are a Skarsgard fan I would suggest watching True Blood re-runs until the show returns. What a waste of two hours I won't get back."
4,surprisingly good,"the story was odd, the relationship to the game, unique but a small part of the plot or i would have stopped watching, the aliens and the story one of the better i have seen and most believable i enjoyed it a lot"
1,Save Your Money,"Unless you like watching your movies through subtitling, do not purchase this item. It offers several options in subtitles except the one on how to turn them off completely. My viewing was ruined by the subtitling across the bottom of the screen that often took up as much as a third of the picture. Foolish me disposed of the packaging and return label so am stuck with a DVD I will never watch again."
2,Dont like it much,"This movie was way too slow and action was pretty bad the whole story did not make lot of sense and we where not very impressed with , felt like waste of money"
2,Disappointed,Not what I thought it was going to be at all. I was bored all the way through the movie. Even the graphics werent all that exciting.
2,Ship should have sunken in the first few minutes. It didn't.,"I can not think of anything that could save this movie, Taylor Kitsch was great in Friday Night Light s. This is his second losing movie and its not his fault, the movies are lousy in every aspect and he alone can,t save them.One more bad movie and its 3 strikes and he,s out."
1,One of the worst,"What is it with Hollywood insisting that 90 pound girls can battle monsters, aliens and men trained to fight? The only guy they may be to take is Orlando Bloom. Rhianna is ridiculous as she saves men that weigh twice as much by simply pulling them up and shoving them as if she has the strength to do it. Even better, when punched in the face repeatedly by a super robot with super metal fists, she simply shrugs it off and gives the big meanie a dirty look.The effects are over the top silly. If it was not for Brooklyn Decker, I would have turned this garbage off.The nod to the WWII Vets was the only good part.Hollywood makes real garbage lately. They rely so much on CGI, that there is no effort to write a good story or make anything slightly reasonable.Stupid, stupid, stupid."
2,Battleship,Despite a few big name stars and special effects the Battlehip sinks to the bottom with all hands on board for me ...only worth watching if you have insomnia ..it might put you to sleep.
1,Awful movie,"This was a dreadful movie. I was very disappointed. The critics were absolutely right. I love sci fi movies, even the really hokey ones as long as they're at least amusing -- even Starship Troopers, but this was a complete waste of time and money."
3,Good special efects,"Just a regular movie, the tipical rebel boy who turns in hero to save the planet. The aliens suposed to be more advance but with oldest ship the Earth wins the battle, OMG!! I you expect some kind of reference with the boardgame Battleship, just a few seconds."
1,Don't waste your time with this...,"Seriously, don't... The story is stupid, the acting is sub-par by everyone but Liam Neeson, the only good thing about this movie might be the effects. And why in the world is this called ""Battleship""? There's little-to-no references to the game at all. Should be called ""Terrible Alien Invasion 2.0"" Just don't waste your time. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,BLAH UGH,"I viewed this movie via Amazon Instant Video and I am soooo thankful I did not go to the theatre to see it!! Such a boring movie. Very little action. What action there was, was just boring. No good actors I can make note of (no idea why Rhianna was in this movie) She should stick to singing. Just a boring boring Blah movie. Unless your ready for a nap, wait til this is on local tv channels, and only then if something else is not on."
1,Absolutely terrible eve Liam Can't help this one. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY,"If I can add 2 hours to your life by helping you steer clear of this one, let me help you out. NO REDEEMING features in this movie. Bad acting, incoherent/ridiculous plot & 2 hours of your life you won't get back. I found myself fast forwarding through the first 30 minutes of 'back story' just to find the action in this movie. Just say no. Liam finally made a horrendously terrible film- actually he's barely present in the movie at all. Avoid at all costs."
3,Not Bad,"Battleship was a decent movie. The story was a little light, but the action was good. Nothing great to say, but nothing really bad to say."
3,Just OK,"The flick was ""just OK."" A lot of action but I found my mind wondering and that is unusual when I am watching a movie. I spend a lot of my entertainment dollar on movies so I usually am selective in my choices... this one got me."
3,Battleship was mediocre,"Battleship was at best mediocre. The special effects were really nice but there were so many things about the plot that were left unexplained, such as ""Why did the aliens behave the way they did""? Things just didn't add up. There were lots of things like that all across the board that annoyed me about this movie."
3,Pleasant but not what I expected.,Gooad action but the story did not develope as I had hoped for. Actors were good but was lacking on giving this movie the edge it needed to compete in the world of sci-fi.
2,Movie Only Slightly Better Than Amazon's Video Streaming Quality,"Let me be brief. The movie plot, script,and acting were less than mediocre. The plot improved slightly when the action started a third of the way in. However, worse than all of this is Amazon's unreliable video streaming. It's never very enjoyable to watch a movie with 25-30 interruptions lasting from 20 to 60 seconds each."
4,Decent American Anti-Alien propaganda,"This movie was a bit on the rosey patriotic side, and as usual the Americans save the day, but it is action packed and has good graphics."
4,BATTLESHIP,"GOOD ACTION MOVIE , ENTERTAINING AND ENGAGING . NOTHING STELLAR ABOUT THE CAST OR THE PLOT , JUST GOOD MINDLESS ACTION"
3,Action packed adventure!,"If you are looking for the next oscar winners you wont find that here. However if you love action, savung the world, and good old fashioned kicking alien rearend then this one is for yoy. Enjoy my earthling commrads!"
3,Good Action Movie,"If you like a little sci-fi and action, you'll like it. I like how they made a relation to the actual board game at a few points."
3,Kinda Crappy,"Was a cross between Transformers and Pearl Harbor. The special effects were OK, but the plot and the acting left a little to be desired. Do I regret watching it? No... but would I watch it again? No!"
3,Action packed,"I gave it three starts because romance is a little too corny, the story line is linear, some of the scenes are a little over the top (6 guys caring a 1000lb ordnance? Six Olympic power lifters couldn't carry that) and the whole movie is way to predictable. With that said, the action and computer animation in the movie was really good. I have watched it a couple of times. It has that 2012 way about it where you know it is cheese, but you through it in on a Thursday night when you are looking for a movie to watch."
4,liked it,this is nothing like the board game I grew up with but it was still good sci fi action movie
3,Playboy gloss and sheen,"The usual run of the mill, playboy bare all with a touch of realism. All of us have fantasies, and playboy has glossed the scenes in its usual style. Good footage and great ideas. The women are worth the extra bucks that playboy videos cost."
4,Predictable but amusing and the characters are great!,"Louise Bagshawe finally has some characters with flaws and complexity. Having said that, the ending is totally apparent from near the start of the book. The journey to get to the end is so contrived, but amusing, clever and funny. A really enjoyable read."
1,weak steel blades,"John Frederick posted a moronic review. What kind of person says they like a product without even using the thing? Well, he can play with his little chain. I've used these cutters. For average steel, the monster leverage will slice through like a hot knife through butter. So, a standard chain is easy game. But put the blades against a relatively small 1/2 inch thick seriously hardened steel bar and you'll end up getting dents on the surface of the cutting blades. The design of the cutter is ok in most respects other than this serious flaw of inferior steel in the cutting blades.You get what you pay for. If you're the type that buys quality, move on. Don't buy this. I'd normally give the cutter a 2 star because it has some utility. But John Frederick posted a five-star with no basis and I wouldn't be surprised if he was associated with the company."
3,Big Steel,This bolt cutter is very useful and big. I love it.I am happy when I go to the hardware store and see half the bolt cutter at twice the price.
5,Dustjacket Blub,"The concept of designing yachts and small craft by eye has not entirely disappeared, but, as in most fields, a more scientific approach now dominates. It is no longer enough to creat boats intuitively, with the help of a hand-hewn, half-model and unerring faith. Today the designer strives to understand and predict the ways in which craft behave under the varying conditions imposed by wind and sea, following the principles of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics.This book seeks to guide the reader thorugh these principles, taking in the creative, visual aspects of design, but primarily concentrating on hull forms, sails, keels and rudders, and how they interact. Sailing balance and performance prediction are explored, based on the use of models for testing, and the author examines techniques for producing lines plans, detailing the various associated calculations, complete with examples. The culmination of this rationale is a step-by-step procedure for design."
5,Damn Fine Music,"Bought this at Costco on a lark. Impulse buy. Was the best $20 spent all month. 36 songs total. Lots of the hits; ""Operator"", ""I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song"", Time in a Bottle"", ""Bad Leroy Brown"", ""Alabama Rain"", I was already familiar with, and there is a whole lot more I'd never heard. It's great mellow, spiritual music from the 70's. This is a great package that plays very well on a hazy day in Southern California. If you need a nice refreshing change of pace after listening to the nu-metal, or hip-hop junk out these days, try some Jim Croce. You will dig this. You see it, buy it. You will not be disappointed."
5,Grandma,It is just what our grand-daughter wanted for quite a while. She will be delighted with it when she receives it for Christmas.
3,Not everyone has this type of experience with Kundalini.,"This may be a good book for explaining what can happen when an awakening occurs if the heart has not been fully opened. A kundalini awakening that is activated without a heart focus can be dangerous psychologically and physically. Awakening kundalini should not be attempted by those who do not desire complete peace, harmony, and love and are willing to let down ALL of the armament that we humans take up. This should not be attempted without preparation. An awakening will change you and you will need to be cared for differently than most humans. Use great care. When communion with the god within is approached with the heart, kundalini will naturally rise to meet it's maker. All you need is sincerity, surrender, and dogged focus. Your god will come to you and communion will be yours."
2,A Weak Effort,"The hallmark of Faerie Tale Theatre has always been its innocence. In ""Sleeping Beauty"", there are just too many ""adult"" (i.e. sexual) innuendos to continue that innocence. Though the innuendos themselves are somewhat humorous (thanks to the acting of Christopher Reeve), they are still just out of place in this series.Besides Reeve, Bernadette Peters and Beverly D'Angelo most primarily guest star.This is an episode that can easily be skipped in your journey through this series."
2,Faerie Tale Theatre: Sleeping Beauty,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I've enjoyed many others from the Faerie Tale Theatre collection, so I was expecting to be more like the others. It was not very romantic or uplifting, as I expected Sleeping Beauty to be. It was comical, but were a couple parts that had sexual inuendos (sp?) and I would have been embarrassed if I had watched this for the first time with family or friends. I bought this movie thinking it would be a cute, romantic fairy tale that my family and I would enjoy. But I don't know if I even want my young children to watch it. Overall, it was okay, but did not at all meet my expectations."
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought the 4 DVD set, which includes all the 26 fairy tales, I haven't watched all of them yet, but this is definitely the worst one I've watched..it is definitely not for children, don't expect anthing like the disney one, u will have a hard time figuring out why it is called sleeping beauty!! half of the episode involves a woodsman telling a story..they're trying to be funny but they're not..I found myself fast forwarding through most of it."
1,not age appropriate,"I ordered this dvd along with the dancing princesses. My daughters love fairy tales and knew both stories well. They love the dancing princesses. We only got 20 minutes into this one before we turned it off. (and it was a long 20 minutes!) This version of sleeping beauty is full of sexual innuendo. Furthermore, the story is hard to follow and boring. It is nothing like the Disney movie or the fairy tale book version. Don't waste your money. Buy the dancing princesses instead!"
3,Geometry Book,"This book has a few errors and is not very descriptive. However, it is a course requirement. So, I guess it has to be okay."
3,So happy my mom hasn't done anything like this yet! lol,"I liked the first, second, and third, the fourth was okay. You'll get some chuckles out of them but its a good read when you have nothing else to do."
5,Ideas that I always remember on empowering others,"I read this book the first time about 5 or so years ago. At the time the manager I worked for, I really admired. I liked my team. I liked my job. I felt good about where I worked and what I did! This book is a great deal of the reason why - my manager used it's principles to empower his team, and to encourage the team to empower each other. I have recently moved to a new office and have bought a copy for everyone. I would encourage you to buy it too....its very inexpensive for all the concepts contained within it."
5,How to become a managerial super-hero!,"This is a great book. I was introduced to some of its principles a few years ago at a seminar, but didn't read the full thing till this year.The book is a fable chronicling the journey from managerial idiot(who most of us have worked for or with at one time or another) to managerial super-hero. Many managers who I deal with in my job don't have any understanding of how to manage people, they have risen to the position of manager through having great technical skills. This book addresses that, it's an easy read so even reluctant readers will find it enjoyable, and it may even provide a good refrersher to those who have been managing others for a while.It's simple in format and style, but it's got lots of layers to it, and its insights get deeper the further you dig. If you open it expecting pages of managerial psychology, you will be disappointed - this book is far more accessible than that.Happy zapping!"
3,A short read and of value,"This book is easy to read due to the fairytale format. The people I recommended it to found it a refreshing read and a change from the brick heavy management books we usually leave unfinished. It could however be an insult to the intellegence of some people, therefore recommend to only those who have a sense of humour."
2,It's a cute read,I found the book simplistic and obvious. It provided entertainment one afternoon at work when I had nothing else to do. Most good managers already apply most of the principals in the book. I think that bad managers will need a whole lot more then zapping (fry 'em I say). I did enjoy reading it though...it was a cute read.
2,Eye opener.,"I think anyone in business should read this book, especially management. This book shows how to relate to people, what motivates people and how to maximize potential. Employers, managers and employees will enjoy this book. It is short, to the point and very effective."
1,Did not live up to expectations,"I read this book thinking it would begin to make sense as the chapters unfolded, it did not. It does not add any viable information regarding ""empowerment"", I have to say it is the worst book I have ever read on this subject. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Simple read but not worth to own one,I can't agree more with Gardengirl58. The fairy tale story telling format put me off. More for easy reading.
4,Not sure what to expect,When I first started reading this book I was not sure what to expect. I wasn't all that excited about the fairy tale setting. As I read on I found myself suprised at how much I could relate to the situations being described. After reading the book I think the Fairy tale setting was great because it helps you visualize more the way others feel and how you may not recognize that from the outside. I think this was a very good book with some wonderful ideas and insight. I would reccomend it to anyone who has trouble relating to associates from a management standpoint or just associate to associate.
5,ZAPP! ROCKS!,This book is completely transforming my management force. My managers are more employee focused and the results are naturally falling in line. I highly reccommend it.
5,Very Good,One of the best books of its kind. Easy to read and understand. Can be used by a CEO or a front line employee. Both can benefit.
4,Great Phone!,"Honestly, when I first started using the phones I heard static. There is a ""clarity booster"" that you can switch on while on a call that seemed to help a little bit. I really liked the phones so I decided to use them through the weekend to see what happened and strangely enough, after about 2 days, the static cleared up.The phones come with an easy to use joystick for navigation, clear LCD screen where the caller's name, phone number and picture (if stored) display very clearly. There are only a few ringers to choose from but who cares because it was designed to include your own music.I love the phones!"
5,Great device,"These phones are great looking and the feature allowing you to see and hear using the camera is great addition to ones home phone system. I have expanded my system to 4 phones and one camera and they all work great. The image from the camera is great and can be adjusted to your liking. Any phone can access the camera, as well as page one another."
2,Photos and Ring IDs does NOT sync up to other Handsets,"I purchased this phone with 3 additional handsets because I liked the Color display. The phone has a USB and With the included software and USB driver (not compatible with VISTA) you can download your personal photos and wav files to the phone. As with the cell phone, you can assign different photos and rings to different people in your address book. After registering my add'l handsets to the base phone, I was able to sync the address book to the other handsets, however, the ringtones and photos which I had assigned for individual people were not synched over with the address book on the other handsets. For the price of this phone (espicially since it's a discontinued phone) I'm very disappointed that this is not able to be done. Phone quality is good, however, if you're seeking for color and sharing the phonebooks photos and ringers with the other handssets, I wouldn't get this cordless phone."
3,Zero 7 - Distractions (CD 2),"The second disc of DISTRACTIONS mixes sees the Idjut Boys take a slow, loping approach to the track. It's languorous, but not particularly interesting as it chugs along. Madlib, on the other hand, goes for abstract jazz with his mix, replete with vibraphone."
4,Good but narrow,"By limiting herself to Blackmun's own papers, Greenhouse presents a most interesting glimpse into the way a justice's legal philosophy evolves with time. She particularly stresses the lifelong relationship between Chirf Justice Burger and Blackmun which changed from a mutually adoring friendship to an ideologically competitive one, finally culminating in open rupture. Had she included interviews of other justices or friends and family members, would the book have shown more dimensions of Blackmun's life and also been a bit more of a page turner?Probably the strongest point in the book is her emphasis that the original majority (7-2) decision handed down by Bluckmun on Roe vs Wade was not about a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion but about a doctor's constitutional right to practice unfettered medicine. She also traces the way the media and the court itself gradually subverted that original intent."
4,Great Account of Supreme Court Justice,"Greenhouse's writing is brisk, controlled, and informed. Her book is the right length because although Blackmun was an interesting man -- who wrote interesting decisions -- he lacked the color of Franfurter, Fortas, Douglas, or Marshall. I also appreciated Greenhouse's discussion of Burger since there is so little written about him."
4,One thing to remember about this book,"I also had high hopes for this book, as anyone who knows Linda Greenhouse's work can attest, she is a reliable interpreter of the High Court and supreme in analytic ability. As a biographer I must always defer to the hard evidence, in this case Justice Blackmun's papers, which Ms. Greenhouse drew her information from. But I read in the reviews of her work an expectation that plagues the best writers-their publics want everything in every work they read. There are in this case editors to satisfy and publishers to placate. Linda Greenhouse, like all the rest of us, must dance to the publisher's tune and it is clear that some necessary cuts (i.e., marketing considerations) were made that left her vulernable to the criticism we see here. At any rate, Good Job Linda, I applaud you."
5,Fast and saved money,There aren't many BodyShop stores where I live so when I can have these products shipped to my door for less than it would cost for me to drive to the store - that's a win/win.
4,A must have for romance readers!!,"Suzanne Brockmann brings the life of Navy SEALs into sharp focus with her mini-series Tall, Dark and Dangerous. This is the fourth book in the series and it is excellent. The characters, especially Lt. Harlan ""Cowboy"" Jones and Melody Evans, are completely realistic, they could be living next door to you or me, and I feel like I could visit Appleton and navigate my way around. The book is a page turner, there is no doubt about it. The emotion throughout this book is strong and compelling. I felt like I was there watching the sparring and the loving between Mel and Cowboy. It was definetely worth the wait and I can't wait to get Harvard's Education in October."
3,Poor pitiful Melody,Melody will really get on your nerves!! This was why I pretty much gave it an average review. Her whining and feeling sorry for herself went overboard. Even that. You don't feel any connection between the two. At least I didn't. It's just not there. (...)
5,"Everyday, Average Jones (Tall, Dark & Dangerous, Book 4)",Book was inspiring.Book arrived in a very timely fashion.Book arrived in excellent condition.
5,Was a pleasure to read and I couldn't put it down.,"Melody Evans and Harlan ""Cowboy"" Jones was a great combination. This story shows you the trust that is needed in a relationship among friends and lovers."
3,"Not bad, but not good","This novel reminded me of something Coleridge said about some minor point, that is astonishing how little ability is necessary to be commercially successful.I read this book twice, one time after the other. I had never read this sort of book before and had little expectation. I had read ""Payton Place"" which I enjoyed, and I tried to read Victoria Holt, but could not endure it. The plot could hardly be simpler: Girl is rescued by dynamic hero; they make love (described with restrained detail); she gets pregnant; she has a baby; hero finds out; hero offers to marry girl; she wants a husband for real affection, not obligation; he convinces her; they marry.The writing is clear, there is no hint of pretense, but nor is there any genius. I also read another book of the ""seal"" series by this author, but it seemed the same story again with the details different, but the sex scenes almost identical.""Wuthering Heights"" it ain't. But it OK for a highly transient book"
2,Don't Start With This One,"If you're new to Laura Nyro -- one of the great voices of her time, a wonderful songwriter and a fine pianist -- please don't begin your collection with this CD. It appears that a lot of effort went into the remastering of these old tapes, but the unfortunate truth is that, for whatever reason, her voice sounds strained and even rather grating on this recording. There are so many better releases, live or studio, for those who want to begin a Laura Nyro collection."
5,Stunning,"I've been a fan of Laura's work for the past ten years or so when someone recommended ""Gonna Take A Miracle"" to me. This CD is full of so much beauty...Hearing Laura live is an amazing experience...How can one woman and a piano take you on such a journey? Truly a magical evening. ""American Dove"" is one of the best Laura compositions I've heard...and once again, her versions of the songs of her youth are interpreted with the depth of someone twice her age. My personal favorites on this CD would have to be ""American Dove"", ""Ain't Nothing/Natural Woman"", and the AMAZING ""I Am The Blues"". Sit down at the fireplace, light the candles and ENJOY!"
3,Curious,"It seems that the point of the story was that if we persist in doing well we could eventually enjoy the good things in life that may come our way. Adversely, shortcuts that give reward with compromise will eventually shorten the future happiness that was to be our lot."
2,Disappointed,"Some friends told me that this album is a great example of ""intelligent pop"" music, a la Jellyfish and The Grays. I was very disappointed -- the music is very repetitive and somewhat monotonous. I had a hard time listening to the whole thing."
3,The beginning of a soft era,"If you're like me, you'd probably expect a hard-rocking metal tone with dark energy when listening to a KJ album. Then again, the techno-like dance-able Night Time came along, but at least that was still spectacular in my opinion. They've always been rhythmically tight and appealing, including the songs on here, but the album still portrays somewhat of a sleepy feeling. Still decent, but lacking the kick I would expect to feel when knowing all their other material. Yet, this would definitely be worth a try for the best tracks on here, Chessboards and Victory. That's about all I can say about this one."
1,Deer Stags Men's Boot,I would never buy these again. After only one week of my son wearing them the whole bottom fell off one of the boots. Absolutely not happy with them at all. After spending the money I did on them I have to go out and buy him another pair.
1,Fell Apart,"These were used for casual everyday dress, not work and it took all of 2 weeks for the sole to separate from the boot. Crap!"
2,Weak retraction spring,"This leash was a little pricey but when the package arrived it seemed like it might be worth the price, it felt sturdy and had a nice grip. The problem is that the leash doesn't retract very well so any quick movements by my dog results is a wrap up that has to be untangled.When the leash gets wet it becomes worse, we have to dry it out to get the leash back in the handle, too bad as I like the feel and it appears well made, just poorly engineered."
4,Not super zippy but...,"...it does the trick. Overall I think it's a decent product and value. I like that the entire 16 ft. of the leash is made of the nylon webbing. I was tricked on my last leash that only had abou 18 in. of nylon and which only lasted a couple of months. It's true that when fully extended the leash doesn't retract faster than my dog moves which on occasion leads to a tangle. I can see where this could pose a safety risk for your dog in certain situations (traffic, other dogs, etc.) but so far I've got no complaints. I've found that if you tilt the handle down, w/the opening toward the ground it seems to retract more quickly."
1,"Complete garbage, not worth it at one quarter the price","Bought this leash out of desperation, couldn't find the Flexi brand that I had for my other dog. Before one month was up, it stopped retracting unless I slapped it a few times. The spring was weak and pretty ineffective from the beginning. Very expensive and if extended to the limit, it is nearly impossible to retract. Has resulted in my dog coming close to getting into bad situations since I can't control the dog properly once the leash is extended if I need to reel her in quickly. Very angry and disgusted with this product. Utter garbage, and I will never buy anything from this company again. Would rate this zero stars if I could."
4,Waechtersbach Fun Factory Service for 4,"This is a nice set. They have a wide variety of colors to choose from and the color I got looks good, especially for a solid color pattern with no graphics. Also, the shapes of the mugs and the bowls are good.I am rating 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems that they are not microwave safe. According to the manufacturer, this dinnerware is dishwasher safe, but they don't mention them as being okay to use in the microwave. I've read reviews where people have said that they got crazing (cracks in the colored enamel layer) due to microwaving.I don't know if this set and line deserve 3 stars instead of 4 due to not being microwave friendly, but other than this issue, they seem fine. I received broken pieces in the first shipment I received, but everything worked out fine, as amazon took care of it. Amazon gets 5 stars for resolving the issue with the broken pieces."
1,"Not the item, but the seller","I had this on my wish list with $104 price. When my friend ordered it for me, the seller accepted the order but then cancelled it without notification and raised the price to $175."
4,Under Pressure,I thought this was a great movie. Very suspensful and it was a different role for Sheen. He did a great job at making you hate him.
5,dark and funny,charlie sheen is an insane firefighter whose wife leaves him so he starts messin with the neigbors nextdoor he starts out by punching out thier windshield to move thier car later on he gets mad at the kids for wasting earths precious water and he fights an asian mailman who asked to use his phone charlie sheen plays a a great psycho and is funny in a dark way this movies basically a cheap falling down clone but i give 5 stars for the funny parts
3,The future of controllers???,The nintendo gamecubes wavebird controller is okay...it's nthn special it just lets you play from long distances...the only thing is u have to like point it towards gamecube....(just like remote u have to point towards tv) i got this because 1 of my controllers [an inexpensive] company 1 (intec) was not working right so i decided y not get a wavebird....the things i don't like about wavebird is it uses batteries and u have to point it towards gamecube without anything blocking the controller signal thing thats in the gamecube controller slot....i should have just got a standard ngc controller...the wavebird is good though....if you want to play from long distances and don't care about buying batteries then this controller is for you...but i would choose a standard controller over a wavebird....hopefully the wavebird controller isn't the future of controllers...because it has some flaws....i give the wavebird a 3 out of 5.
1,No rumble!,This is a cheap piece of [junk] that weighs as much as the huge xbox controller. At least that contoller has rumble.
2,stick with the standard controller,"Sure it has its advantages. This conroller is a lot easier to store because there's no messy wires to roll up, and when you're playing with freinds, you dont have to worry about tangles. However, it does not have the precision of a standard controller. You can tell when you first try it that there is a little lag in the reactions, and once the batteries get old, it lags more and more and sometimes doesn't even work at all. Overall, the concept is good, but it needs improvements."
1,known gamer,first of all dont listen to what the other people have to say. The controller won't even be out for a couple of days. Meaning that these people really have know idea what the are talking about. If you want moreand accurate information I suggest that you go to www.ign.com they have the most accurate info for all of your gaming needs.Plus I only gave it one star because it is not out yet i dont want to rate someting I haven't used and ether should these other people
2,"Wireless is nice, but no rumble ....","Wireless feature is great. Batteries last a long time. You don't have to point the controller at the G'Cube to get it to work. All good things.However, I never use my Wavebird anymore. Games are using the rumble feature in newer and more interesting ways that its hard to play without rumble. I won't play games like Zelda and Mario Party without rumble.Since there is no option for colors, if you do buy four wavebirds, you may get confused by the four gray controllers unless you mark them with a pen.And I wish there was an auto-turn-off feature. So many times I've left my wavebird on overnight draining the batteries."
4,cool controller,My brother has this controller but I still use it. I ts very cool. you can use it through walls.perfect when you're sick in bed.
3,It's Ok,"I bought a Wavebird only because I found it in a store that accidentally had it marked at a lower price than a regular contoller. It works alright, but I do notice a slight lag when I am playing the more control active games such as Tony Hawk 3. That can be quite frustrating. The lack of rumble is also nagging at me.Other than those two thing I see nothing wrong with the Wave Bird, and I use it as my primary controller."
5,Perfect,"Dont worry about this thing not working, it works perfectly! Ive walked about 80 ft away, completely non-line of sight, through about 6 or seven walls, and I went down three floors at my apartment complex, and my friend in the room (via cellphone) said everything was working fine and smooth. I have two, and havent had any cross interference problems."
5,This is awsome!!,"I bought this yesterday, because my eyes started to hurt sitting close to my big-screen. It give me a lot of freedom. I can just lay on the couch and play Metroid Prime all day, with out sittimg up close and hurting my back and eyes. They wavebird is very light and has over 100+ hours of battery life. I recommend this to anyone who has a big screen t.v. or the t.v. is far away form your couch.This is an awsome contoller. MUST BUY!!"
5,A must-have if you own a GameCube,"You are selling yourself short if you don't own this controller and own a GameCube. It is an engineering marvel that works just as well as wired controller. Battery life is superb, range is great, and the feel of the controller is on par with everything else Nintendo makes. Buy it - you won't regret it."
5,The Bird Soars High and far !!!,The wave bird controller is not heavy at all. It can send its signal through 6 walls! This is a very important controller for all big gamers. The wavebird does not require its own memory card. It also has channels so you can have multiple controllers. I love the Wavebird controller.
5,Kick butt controller,This controller is flawless. I bought this controller the moment it came out. I have read about it for months and am very happy with it. The controller does not weigh very much at all. A tad bit more than a regular cube controller. The box says it works perfect from 20 ft away but I tried it out and it works almost 60 ft away without any problems at all. It is quite amazing. It has a battery life of about 15 continus hours. The only draw back is that it doesnt have a rumble feature but thats not a big deal. BUY IT!!!
4,"No cords, great! No rumble, bad.","As many others, I had doubts about the Wavebird's reliability. I was soon stunned by the amazing reliability of it. The Wavebird really works well, and can work over twenty feet away. The lack of cords was the entire base of the Wavebird, but it has downsides. Downside one is the use of batteries, but if they're going to last 100 hours, who cares? Downside two is the rumble feature, sure you don't need it for most games, but in StarFox (staff rumbles near secret) and Zelda: WindWaker (rumbles for EVERYTHING) it can prove a HUGE disadvantage."
5,awesome,"my mom and dad promised me 2 more controllers because my cousins were coming over for christmas and we only had 2 controllers so we went shopping for one and i bought the wavebird but i only bought one incse it didnt work. i didnt want to buy it but my mom talked me into it. i knew that it wouldnt have a cord and that was kewl, but i didnt know if it would work if a small obstruction was in the way and i thought it would be much bigger and clunkier and heavier because of the added battery compartment but now here i am buying another one because it was so awesome. i can even go upstairs and it still works. its not heavier at all and it feels just like the regular controller. the wavebird is definately a good investment if u like to play video games"
3,It Quit Right Away!,"This was a great controller, but stopped workng within the first week. I can't find any reason for it; but it is useless now, and the money is down the drain. I can't find my receipteither."
3,Sounds Coo...,Sounds good wireless good I like it well and 20 feet no wire cool so I can sit at the chair where I can never reach or my gamecube falls down cause wire and i rate this 4/5 because the batteries but they aint much so Its AWESOme.
1,Disappointed,"This wireless controller did not work well in our house. We have to be very close the the game cube for the controller to work. So we don't use it, instead we gave it to our 2 1/2 year old who pretends to use it. Instead of the wireless, we use the wire controller with the optional extension cable. We also had trouble with wireless internet in our house, so I guess for some reason our house is not very wireless friendly."
5,GREAT CONTROLER,"The WaveBird is a great controler. I love it because it is made by Nintendo, you never lose contact between the controler and the console, and it is the only controler made by a system manufactuer. It Is GrEaT"
4,Awesome!,"i got a wavebird for Christmas and it works so good you wouldnt believe it. I tested it for range and it worked at over 100 feet literaly. The only problom is that it has no rumble which is sometimes a good thing when you need to concentrate. The contollers of any system dont last forever. They can last 6 months to 5 years, depending on how much you use them, and how hard you push on the control and c sticks."
4,Another reason to buy the Cube,"Nintendo has taken a new step in video gaming. I know I never really enjoyed the controller cords that you have to wrap and unwrap to use the paddle. Now, that's all in the past (for us GameCube users anyway). I tested it out and the controller was about 24 feet away, even with objects blocking a direct path to the system. That means you can play and eat with the rest of the family for those of you with parents telling you to eat at the table.The only reason I would not call it perfect is because it does not include a rumble pack and can't adapt to one.All in all, I suggest it to anyone who has or is considering getting a GameCube-- can your X Box or PS2 do that?"
4,So many memories until my batteries melted inside the controller,"The sole drawback of the Wavebird is its lack of rumble. I remember owning this thing in 7th or 8th grade and loving it. It blew my mind with its lack of wires and responsiveness. My standards weren't very high back then, but still, great controller, totally reliable, watch out for battery explosions (from leaving in hot temperatures)."
3,okay...,"Nintendo rules amongst one of the top console/handheld gaming companies. Rivaled only by Sony Playstation and Microsoft XBox. Playstation's controller is too complicated. XBox's controller is too big. Nintendo's GameCube controller is just right. However, this new Wave Bird controller is one that I judge as a mistake. Despite the popular and rather convienient ""wireless"" functions, this product is too bulky and a little on the heavy side. Other than that, this controller is OKAY."
5,The Wireless Wonder,"The wavebird is definitely going to be a big success. I purchased one, and after testing it out on a variety of games I have discovered that it truly makes wireless gaming a reality. Even with crazy button mashing games like Smash Brothers the controller works flawlessly. I experienced no lag, and for only a little more than the standard controller how could you go wrong? The wavebird lacks a rumble feature, but considering that would add stress on the batteries, it seems like a good choice. Knowing that you can now kick back with no worries about cords getting ripped out of the system, or worse, the system being knocked of a shelf definitely makes me a Happy Gamer. I would definitely recommend the Wavebird."
4,it`s a steal,I think the wireless controller is great beacuse you don`t have tobe to close the system and get a headache like i do.Another goodthing about the wireless is that they are affordable and are durable.But I gave it 4 becuase you need to keep changing the batteries and it begins to cost money!
3,Adequate,The device didn't cost much. The directions were sparse and incomplete. It will work when installed. It is exactly what is needed. It came quickly and was new in the box.
3,Questionable Quality.,"There is a great variety of recipes, and each recipe has a very helpful scale next to it describing the level of difficulty and preparation time, but I give the book only three stars because I have had varied success with the recipes. Whether due to bad recipes or bad proofreading, a number of the recipes appear to be missing ingredients or otherwise faulty. I currently have a large bowl of pudding-like mixture that is supposed to be ""Chocolate Chestnut Truffles,"" but never got firm enough to form into truffles."
1,Sweet Nothings or Tuscan Garbage,"An expensive worthless cookbook written by two women who either never tested the recipies or never proof-read the galleys - or both. I have tested several of the recipies, and none of them were successful. I have been baking for more than forty years; and as I read the recipies, I could not believe that any would be successful. In each recipe I tested, there seemed to be an ingredient missing or a step missing. If you are in need of a lead doorstop, try the ""Torta di pistacchio"". If these two women own and operate a cooking school, it should be closed and their teaching licenses revoked."
4,Tasty Desserts Italian Style,I was looking for some new items to make for the holidays or just anytime. I think this book will do just fine.
5,Thank you Between the Lions for reading this book to us!,"My son and I watched Between the Lions and they read this book today. My son LOVED it, and so did I. My husband often travels for business, me less so, and this is a great book for showing kids we will do anything to get home to them. I'm getting two copies of this book before either of us takes one more trip, and the away parent can read it to my son over the phone before bed!"
5,Great Book,WOnderful fo those who have children at home and may travel often. Great for parents (not too long to read). . . and wonderful for preschoolers learning to read. . ..
4,My daughter loves this CD and book,My daughter is 6 years old and really enjoys listening to this CD and following along with the book at bedtime. It is one of her favorites.
4,Dogs love them,"My dogs love these but the only problem is that they are not crunchie enough and they almost choked on them so I just pop them in the oven for half an hour at 350 and they come out crunchy and I have no problem with them trying to chew them and it's fun to hear them crunch, crunch, crunch all the time. But best of all there is free shipping and I got 10% off on my order. Thanks a bunch."
2,Too brittle and overcooked,"I did subscribe and save for these chicken tenders - 2 packages per month. The first two batches were fine and I thought they were priced fairly. The last batch arrived and in both packages the treats were darker brown like they were overcooked (instead of that light golden color) and they were hard as bricks. All of my dogs are small - 15 pounds or less. My yorkie nearly choked on one of them I have been giving my dogs chicken tender jerkies for over 2 years. I am going to allow one more shipment of these to see if they improve and if they are still this bad, I will cancel my subscription."
1,"Hard, Dry & Made in China","I ordered these for my pug. You can't get more natural than an actual slice of chicken right? I was very wrong.I immediately noticed how hard and dry these chicken strips were. I cut one in half using poultry shears and let the dog try one. My dog began choking on the piece of Cadet brand chicken. I had to physically pull it from his throat because it wouldn't dislodge itself due to how hard and dry it was.Then, while checking the packaging, I read the words that every pet owner dreads...""Made in China""...which I'm pretty sure translates to ""Pet Killers with sub-standard products"".I immediately threw them out and purchased all-natural treats made in the USA. (Plato brand).I would NEVER recommend this Chinese made brand (Cadet) to ANY pet owner. Amazon would do well to create a ""Made in the USA"" section on its web site to avoid crappy, dangerous products like this one."
2,My dog gagged and choked on these chicken strips.,"I gave my dog these chicken strips and he choked and gagged and couldn't breath because he tried swallowing the piece whole. If I want to give him these treats, I have to make sure they are cut into little pieces before giving them to him."
5,My dogs give these treats two paws up :),"We have 4 labradors who love chicken breast filets. The one's from Cadet are no exception. After reading some of the negative reviews by other buyers here on Amazon, I almost cancelled my order. Now my dogs and I are glad we didn't. The Cadet product packaging and contents have been top shelf. Not having to pay sales tax nor spend time and gas money running to our nearest wholesale club because we have them delivered right to our door via our ""Prime"" account are big pluses too. And lastly, the icing on the cake is getting the extra 15% discount with our ""Subscribe and Save"" subscription. We gladly recommend this approach to anyone whose pet(s) love chicken breast filets. Hope this is helpful."
1,FDA warns Chicken Jerky treats from China may harm or kill your dog.,"FDA Warns Chicken Jerky From China May Harm or Kill Your Dog. STOP USING THIS PRICEY JUNK NOW!! search ""chicken jerky treats china"" on google for more info and SPREAD THE WORD (some media coverage but way too little...) I am ""fortunate""... my dog only suffered small amount of kidney damage-- others are not so lucky. TELL AMAZON NOT TO SELL CHINESE CHICKEN JERKY."
2,cadet chicken strips from Amazon,The strips were to hard and like rubber. I bought the strips from another dealer at a earlier time and they were fine. I will go back to my original dealer.
4,If made in US it would get 5 stars,"My elderly canine (14-16) loves this treat. The only drawback is this product is from China... and food contamination problems are still a possibility, so caution is needed."
1,Can cause death or illness,"This is made in China. Please do a search on 'china dog chicken jerky"" if you haven't yet learned about these products."
1,Made my dog sick,I just both these because of the 4 star review. I have a boxer that can eat almost anything except for these. He loves chickenstrips but these made him real sick and started to throw up. As soon as I stopped feeding these to him he has slowly recovered and has not thrown up since. If I had know these were from China I would have been more observant. Not to take any further risk I decided to throw all of them out.
5,My dogs LOVE this!,"My dogs (and cats) love this product. I've been using it for years. Just recently, though I've read reviews about the chicken strips from China causing animals to get sick, so although none of my pets have had problems, I've decided not to purchase this type of product anymore, just to be on the safe side."
3,"My dog loves her ""chickie"" treats","I have ordered these before on the internet however, these treats are extremely hard and not pliable at all when I opened the first bag. My dog appears to be doing alright on them but I think from now on I will probably buy them fresh at our grocery store even though these by internet were a little cheaper."
2,cadet chicken breast fillets,"I stopped buying wagon trail because they fillets got so small and I have chow chow's. I'm on auto ship now getting the cadet brand and they were large fillets and thick and now they have become small and thiner. Whats up, you pay the same price for a smaller amount and a smaller item and for large dogs they want several pieces now because they have gotten so small. Not happy I am thinking of canceling my futher shipments unless they fix this issue."
2,Cute but a little cheesy,"This is a cute outfit. It is like all of the other halloween costumes out there in that it is not the best construction of all time, but fine for a day. I ordered it big. If one was a true 12/14 it would be on the small size and likely very short."
4,Great costume,"This costume has really good quality on its fabrication and material (for being a Halloween costume). The size is accurate so, if you know your child's size, it will fit. It is a costume that will last several years, maybe longer than will fit your kids."
4,Child's Car Hop Girl Costume,"My daughter likes wearing this around the house. It is fun and fits her well. It was not expensive and shipped quick, we received the outfit within a couple of days."
4,it worked well,War hammer 40k miniatures were coated with this at room temperature with near 0% humidity. It did its job well enough is all i can say.
3,Lacking in many ways...,"I have the utmost respect and admiration for Pastor Benny Hinn. But I must admit how disappointed I've been with his past few books. This one is no exception. It's obviously ghostwritten to a large degree. My guess is nearly 80% is qhostwritten, and that not even terribly good writing to boot.I expected much more from this particular book, as I'm well aware of the influence Ms. Kuhlman's had on him. Unfortunately, this book is quite a disappointment and I'd have to suggest that one pass on it if they're considering buying it."
1,This item is not properly identified,"This item provides the Hellwig Load Pro product number 9511, which is for the model LP-35 sway bars. However, this item states the model as LP-25. Therefore, either the order number or the model number is incorrect. You have no way of knowing which product (LP-35 or LP-25) you will receive."
1,Garbage...,"Judging by the preview, I would not recommend this to anybody. I am in Tiger Band and this is a cheap imitation. A better idea would be to donate $0.99 to the Band to build a new band hall."
3,A little bit more worn,"than I expected the book to be, but the time for delivery was excellent. This is a great book that explains multiple types of addiction."
3,Not enough useful information,"Not a bad book for just general purposes, but I find it to be lacking in any depth. While it includes many different forms of treatment for some common health problems, it doesn't give enough information on the illness, such as cause or symptons. Those things are just touched on briefly. And some of the treatments described, I find are highly questionable...though of course I am no doctor. But in the case of a Breech Baby I really can't see how taking 1 tablet a day of Pulsatilla 200c, for 3 days, can make a baby turn the right way up. The book is full of way out, unusual treatments that most people would never use. Sure there is practical advice, but that is mostly just common sense. The orthodox advice given just tells you what pills or treatment a doctor would give you...painkillers etc. Ok as a simple reference, but don't expect to find out from it what your symptoms may be of. Because you won't get much help here."
2,Mark's weakest effort,"Okay, positives first - the piano playing of Michael Lewis is nice, and the material is classic. Now the negative: Mark's vocalising on this cd is bad. Honestly, I am a fan, but I thought a cd of Mark singing ""the american songbook"" would be much more pleasurable than this. He certainly has proved to be a singer that can cover a wide variety of styles, from the screaming rock of ""Steppin' Out"" and ""Let Me!"" to the lush balladry of ""First Hymn From Grand Terrace"" and ""Silver Bird"". He, just sounds like he is trying to sing these songs in a....<ahem>...unique way...and failing. Also kind of disappointing that for his first cd in 6 years (following ""Video Dreams"" from 1996), he did a cd of standards instead of his own songs."
2,dont buy it the worst album,this is the most worst album that mark lindsay ever madehe sound awful on it and his singing is ears recking likenails on a wall. but it does make a good coaster for the tablei couldnt even get through the first songs of his i pulled itoff of my cd players i wouldnt buy this album not at all.
1,Defiantely the worst offering from this artist,"Mark Lindsay has always had a unique vocal style, and been the voice on many hit records through the 60's and early 70's. But this offering shows what happens what years of heavy smoking can do to a once great voice. His phrasing style is still the same, but his tone quality is simply shot. Much of the vocalization nearly sounds like a drag queen trying to imitate Carol Channing. This is definately one to pass on, but DEFINATELY pick up his ""Arizona/Silverbird"" two-fer from 1970-71, that shows this man in his prime, with impeccable songs, great production values... and most importantly, a voice not ravaged by time and hard living."
2,"Poor Effort, Great Idea",The idea of a The Sopranos book is a no-brainer. The execution here is poor. Too many errors and a bit of a simplistic take for my tastes.
2,Proofread and fact-check next time!,"There are so many typos and mistakes in this book, I couldn't concentrate on the content. Tony doesn't wear jogging suits; Pussy does. Hyphens are used where em-dashes are required.Mikey's last name is Palmice, not Almice. Janice hasn't ""taken the name 'Vishnamatha or somethin,' "" Tony calls her a ""Vishnu-come-lately."" These are only a few. The mother dying at 34 was laughable, since it happened two years ago and the man is in his 50s. Please, adhere to the adage that ""Haste makes waste."""
4,"Affordable, functional","This cable works just as well as the Monster cables I have, at almost 1/10th the cost. Don't believe the hype around ""premium"" cabling - it's just not worth it."
1,Broken before first use,"Right out of the package, the motor was burnt out and just sparked and smelled like burning plastic. Never did get to try making ice cream with it since it's a gift and in order to get the warranty coverage you have to pay to ship it there and back (which is more than the cost of a cheap ice cream maker)."
3,Fifties Science Fiction,"This is a 1950s science fiction view of Venus, lots of swamps and seas. Lots of age-of-steel naval vessels too. I bought the book on David Drake's reputation, read it once and haven't been back to it in years. Granted he's aping some pretty 2-dimensional science fiction in this book, but even so it wasn't one of his better efforts. Nowhere near the same league as his current Lieutenant (now captain) Leary books."
4,Every RV should come with this mattress,"This mattress is an expotential improvement over the mattress that came standard in our 2008 Fleetwood Tioga motorhome. The RV brochure touted the matress that came with it as a ""luxurious queen-zize, high quality innerspring mattress"". That is a laugh... You lie down on this mattress and it conforms to your body and supports you naturally without springs poking you. This mattress is an excellent replacement mattress for all RV owners. Definitely recommended because it fits in all RV's that have a short 60"" x 74"" queen bed."
2,Hard as Rocks,"This was my first and my last Birkenstock purchase. The soles are very hard and uncomfortable, especially on concrete. Also, I ordered what seemes to be the correct size for me, but these were at least a full size too large. These sandals are wearable, but I usually wear a pair of sandals I picked up at K***'s for only $15. I was very disapointed with this purchase."
4,Birkies are good,I like Birkies and they arrived as described and within the time promised. I didn't realize that they were not made of real leather until I received them - but that was my fault for not reading the description more carefully. My feet are happy.
4,Helped my poor arches!,"These Birkenstock sandals are great! I've found them very comfortable, and my feet had no trouble getting used to them. Shipping service was quick. Choosing the size was sorta complicated, but the price was good."
3,"Love the sandal, but bought the wrong one",Be careful when buying. I wanted a 47 Regular not narrow (N) but bought a narrow by accident. It is a great sandal.when I wanted to send back and change for a regular one the regular was out of stock.
3,Too big,"I ordered a 40, what was supposed to be a women's size 9, but these were way too big. At least 2 sizes. I found a store that sold these and ended up with a size 38. I was told by someone else they had the same problem. Now that I know my correct size I would have no problem buying these again."
1,mateb aldehani kuwait city,"Forms an excellent shoe, but I did not feel comfortable when you usedSumma I advise not to buy itThanks Amazon"
2,Poor shipping service,"I was able to track the progress of this item, and it took almost two weeks AFTER the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped. I also paid for 2 Day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me."
3,Not leather,"Be careful, I ordered what the site said was a leather shoe style, but got the really cheesy looking fake plastic model. I thought I was getting a great deal, but it turns out I got ripped off. I'm not willing to spend 100 buck or more for sandals, so I'm stuck. There is no way to tell which is a leather model and which is plastic, so buyer beware!"
1,Never Again,Bought shoes from FootSmart through Amazon. Shoes didn't fit. Customer service at vendor would not provide return postage because the item was purchased through Amazon and not directly from footsmart. Cost me $11.00 to return shoes. I will buy from Zappos from now on.
3,How do I get in touch with the vendor that sold these to me?,When trying to wear these sandals my foot keeps slipping out and they are as tight as they can be fastened.
3,Low Arch,"Quality of the sandal is great, however, the arch support is dramatically less than my previous pair. Not sure whether more arch support is something you can specify, or if it is model based. If these had the better support found in my old pair, I would have given these a 5 star rating."
5,My Feet are Happy,"Birks are sooooo comfortable. This pair was purchased to replace an old pair. It took me a few days to get them broken in, but now they feel like I've been wearing them forever. The color is a very dark gray -- quite neutral -- goes with anything."
5,Paul's review,I use Birkenstock sandals in lieu of slippers; they are comfortable andpurchasing them thru the Amazon store was painless and efficient.
4,Deal!,"I found these Birkenstocks through an amazon search, and was thrilled by the price. (About $40) I wear these shoes indoors nearly every day, so I have become attached to arizona birks because of their comfort and versility throughout the seasons. (Yes I wear socks with them) This particular variety appears to fit just a little differently at the toes than my last pair, but I am not sure if that is because the last ones had worn down by the end, or if this sizing is a little different.Either way, they are Birkenstocks, that outstanding brand of shoe, that lasts for years, and are so good to your feet."
2,Birkenstock Soles *Shrink*,"Generally, I like Birkenstocks, but they have one SERIOUS drawback. The soles shrink in high heat. I had my Birkenstocks in the back seat of my car. I parked in the sun on a hot day. The soles of my Birkenstocks shrank approximately 1/4"" from the edge of the leather on the sides and about 5/8"" in the toe and heel. The sole also partially separated from the upper. Yeah, I guess for the future I won't leave my shoes in the car when I go inside, but 'cmon, a pair of shoes should be able to handle a hot car on a normal day. Like, what? I'm not supposed to take Birkenstocks on vacation? Or only wear them the whole time? What happens if I want to go on a hike when I'm on vacation? I guess I have to pack my Birks on my back. Can't leave 'em in the car. None of my other possessions were affected on the same trip. Grrr, Birkenstocks."
3,Birkenstock sandals unisex,"The sandals were exactly the model I wanted except that unfortunately they are a bit too wide for my feet. Probably I did not make sure that they come in different width, but as iI am back in Argentina there was not much I could do. In any case I probably might have to give them away!! Thanks anyway!!"
4,great!!,"these are known for beign awsome shoes... & they are! the only problem for me was, not trying them on, so the narrow/medium width became an issue!"
2,TOO BIG,"I ordered the correct size, according the chart provided. They were waaaay too big. As in unwearable.On the plus side, Birks are great shoes, the product was as described, except for size, and it arrived on the day promised. I love Amazon, and use it a lot, but this one was a failure."
5,Love my Birkenstocks,"For the first half of this year I suffered with Plantar Fasciitis and Metatarsal Stress syndrome(a bone fracture). My foot was improving slowly, until I discovered Birkenstock shoes. I noticed that the orthotics that the specialist had made just for me, looked like the foot bed in Birkenstocks. Sure nuff!!! I bought me my first Birkenstock sandal and within 3 days I could tell a hugh difference in the pain subsiding. I now wear Birkenstocks everyday. Bought these so I could wear socks with them. I love my Birkenstocks. I now own 4 pair and will be buying more. My foot pain is gone!!"
3,Classic Birlenstock,"Straps need more holes to tighten, and I find it difficult to make new ones, so to the shoe repair shop."
1,These are probably NOT what you are expecting...,"If, as advertised, you want the ORIGINAL FOOTBED - which is NOT the ""Soft Footbed"" - then these are NOT what you want. I ordered them expecting the original foot bed and received the ""Soft Footbed"" version instead. This was not mentioned anywhere in the ordering process. Pick size, pick width, pick color and material, but no options regarding the footbed. So now I am packaging them up and sending them back, which is a waste of my time. Yes, I am annoyed because I think this is deceptive. Amazon should get it right. The reason they are cheaper may very well be because, in general, people don't want the Soft Footbed, so they are trying to get rid of them. So now you won't be confused or fooled."
5,Happy Feet,I love my new Birkenstocks! They are comfortable with no pinches anywhere. Love the color and comfort. I wear them year around to keep my feet happy.
4,Love my birkenstocks!,"I was a little worried about them at first because they were not as comfortable as I thought they would be, but after a few days of wearing them I fell in love! Your feet start to wear into them and now I don't even want to take them off!"
4,Still Comfy,I bought a new pair as my old ones were well... old 15+ yrs. I still use the old ones these new ones fit the same and are comfy but they squeak like crazy. Both of them and i don't know how to make them stop. I've had them over a year now and they still do it. Which is why 1 star is missing.
5,Great!!,"Added to the Collection, of many, many, many, many, many,many, many, Pairs of Clogs. O yes She Loves her Clogs!!"
3,Not my style.,"I wish I didnt buy these, if you wear them barefoot they really hurt the soles of your feet. Quite simply the Speedo sandals I bought at Costco a few years ago are FAR more comfortable. If you plan on putting on thick socks whenever you wear these, then they may work better for you."
5,Biekenstock Sandals,Shipment was rec'd in a timely manner. Product was exactly as stated. I would purchase from the vendor again.
4,sandals from heaven,"Ok, I bought this sandals to relief my very tired feet and fortunately they are doing a good job for them!"
1,Disappointed,"I had to send my first pair back they were too big. Yesterday I received my birks they were very dusty and I don't think they are leather like the first pair, they scratch easily. The color is not solid it looks faded. . I would retun them but don't want to spend the money again shipping them back. I would not recomend purchasing anything from this company. Very disappointed."
3,The musical score to Seven Alone was first rate!,"As a family film, Seven Alone provided every element required by a discriminating viewer. I would argue, as a lover of exceptional film scores and a collector of soundtracks, that this film is greatly enhanced by the truly beautiful music of Robert O. Ragland. I give the film an A+ because of the impact the music contributes to it."
2,Not too helpful!,"Since India has a distinct culture from the US, I expected to receive some useful guidance from this book. It is very elementry - just remember to be polite and you will do better than you would by following this book's suggestions. Not worth the money or the weight in my luggage."
2,Other Books,"A novel about the horrors of running around on the battlefield during world war one, in the main. Unforunately, it is also a very dull example of the same.The good thing then in that respect, is that it is also quite short so you don't have to put up with it for every long."
2,Strange flavor - couldn't get adjusted to it.,"This popcorn does pop up well with very few hulls. However, it has little to no butter flavor and has a strange taste that I couldn't grow accustomed to. I ate three boxes, trying to convince myself that the flavor would grow on me, before deciding that I was never going to get used to it and the calories weren't worth it. I added butter, flavorings, parmesan cheese, but no luck. Too bad you can't return unused boxes!I ended up giving the rest of it away. A very expensive taste test!"
2,YUCK and GROSS-,I agree with the review about the strange taste. I LOVE LOVE Black Jewell NATURAL flavor popcorn so I decided to try the Butter one. It popped up fine but it just has a weird taste! Even my popcorn loving 12yr old said something was wrong with the flavor. I ordered 6 boxes...don't know what I am going to do with the 5 boxes left...maybe donate? :-( I will continue to buy the Natural by the case and butter it myself.
1,Not the same old Percogesic,"FYI - This product has been bought out by the Tylenol people. I had taken the ""original"" Percogesic for over 35 years. A few months back I purchased this product unknowing that it had been bought out by Tylenol. The analgesic ingredient in this product is tylenol and benadryl - which can be found under numerous other brand names. The original product contained an analgesic called phenylotoxamine citrate - which is not benadryl. This product is the only thing that will get rid of a headache for me and menstrual cramps back in the day. Thankfully one can still locate this product under generic names such as Aceta-Gesic (mfg by Rugby) and others. I now buy this product at a locally owned pharmacy. Shame on Tylenol for changing the entire use for this product as an analgesic to a sleep-aid."
2,Not the product i thought i was purchasing.,"The box shown in the ad calls it original percogesic and does not show diphenhydramine on the box. That is why i ordered it. What i received is the newer product that contains diphenhydramine in place of phenyltoloxamine which is the one that works best to enhance the pain fighting ability of the Tylenol. Disappointing, but i have found a home for the newer product."
3,Not as sold on line.,"I purchased this because it said ""Orginal Percogesic"". This is not. I have used the real orginal percogesic and it worked great. I was excited to see that it said ""Orginal"" and purchased this item. However this is NOT the orginal product and this need to be taken off."
1,Doesn't Contain Phenyltoloxamine Anymore. Search for Phenylgesic at Drugsdepot.com,"Unfortunately the company has taken out phenyltoloxamine from this product and replaced it with diphenhydramine (Benadryll), which doesn't work as well at all. However, phenytoloxamine and acetaminophen tablets ARE still available and fully legal. The brand name I found them under is Phenylgesic, and they have them at drugsdepot.com which is a legitimate old online pharmacy, look up the reviews. Hope this helps everyone."
2,Watch Who You Call A Friend,"The acting was bad but the message and point of the story was great. These women were a piece of work and trust men gossip just as much as women.In the future get people that you can understand what is coming out of their mouth. Second movie with Alize, let it get better not worse"
1,DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I don't usually write reveiws but DO NOT waste your money on this movie. I have seen better, much better."
4,Wow,"This movie shows the other side of people choose to live. A lot of time one know they have it made and take advantage of another thinking they are getting a way with something; when in fact they are the one getting screwed. It is good movie to watch with a glass of wine, no thoughts of wrong-doing and remembering it's only a movie."
5,SHOCKER,I LOVED THIS MOVIE IT WAS LIKE A BOOK ON TV THE SHOCKING TWIST OF BETRAYAL WAS CRAZY GOOD JOB
2,Not Worth Owning,"If you think someone intentionally playing drums badly is funny or you've watched lots of music training videos then you may find some value in this. Comparisons to Spinal Tap are unjustified. At best this is an Andy Kaufmann-esque attempt at anti-humor with only about a half dozen real jokes, and those just get rehashed again and again throughout the course of the brief 28 minute run time. As a concept, I'm glad someone parodied such a niche media, but knowing it exists is probably more satisfying than the actual product."
5,It's about time someone wrote this book!,"I've just finished Carl Nichols' extraordinary book which was a gift to me. I am so grateful that he took the time to write this wonderful how-to full of practial advice, thoughts, and values about work, life, loving, creativity, and leadership. Mr Nichols' book is a welcome relief for those of us who do not have the time or experience to articulate these important principles to our kids. I feel like a much better parent just by having read the book, and I actually find myself having more meaningful conversations with the kids now. We're communicating!So thanks, Mr. Nichols, for having the courage and insight to write this extraordinary book. I plan to buy several copies for Christmas presents for my friends."
3,Very bad flavor,I've been using this for over 2 weeks now and I have to say that the flavor is real bad. I have to put lots of fruit in the blender for it to go down easy. It also will not blend with a fork or wisp. It must be blended at high speed for sure or it just clumps up. I'll probably try another brand after this is finished.
2,Good protein but hard to take it,The protein is great but the taste is horrible. You can mix with anything and you won't be able to change the taste. I would buy more if the company does not add so much salt and improve the taste
4,very good source of protein,"i use this powder , it taste bad , i guess bcuz of the natural taste of eggsa side from the taste the egg protein is amazing for the muscles , it takes up to 6 hours to digestbest solution to trick the taste is to blend with milk and banana + cacao powder"
3,"Good stuff, tastes horrible","This product tastes horrible but seems to work well with me as a meal replacement and post/pre-workout supplement. The egg protein comes from Rose acre farms and comes in a couple bags. So it is not packaged properly and usually makes a big mess when you use it. I recommend transporting the egg protein to another container in an outside area for ease of use. Additionally, when mixing with a regular mixer, foam becomes a major issue and is rather annoying. I highly recommend using a mixing agent such as yogurt or maybe even mixing with chocolate tasting protein powder."
1,What do you expect from a Grade Z movie?,"Well, I knew it was going to be trash. But I""ve seen the incredibly beautiful Whirry in bad movies that actually had some kick to them. This is DOA. But Shannon tries; her co-star, Michael Christian, looks like a really bad, puffy William Shatner. He has zero appeal but does a decent job playing a jerk. When Shannon unveils her potent weapons, however, she nearly justifies checking this film out at all. Thank goodness there's such a thing as fast forward -- and replay."
5,Fantastic!,"Shannon exhibits fine acting in addition to her always fantastic body. Though some aspects of the movie could have been better, Shannon makes it all worth while."
4,Great but missing something...,"Did I miss something here? Yes, this book really speaks to you personally. It describes in detail how you are feeling and what you are going through - it's amazing that Dr. Weeke's knows you as if she has gone through it all herself. HOWEVER, I kept waiting for detailed instruction or for her to go into more depth about what she means exactly by her advice to ""float"" over your anxiety. She does mention what you need to do - accept, face, float and let time pass and does acknowledge that this is very simple advice. I find it so simple though, that I don't understand it. I feel like the whole time she promises to help you recover from anxiety and then forgets to write the chapter on how to do it. That being said, just reading about my symptoms and seeing how common they are did help. To be told to ""accept"" my fears was a big relief. I was exhausted by fighting my fears."
5,Excellent!,"I have only read half of this book, and it has helped me so much already. If you suffer from anxiety and/or panic attacks, this little book will soon become your best friend!"
5,Thank you Dr. Weekes!,"At the time I purchased this book, I was in the midst of a bout of anxiety. After 4 weeks of nervous suffering, I bought this book(not being one to seek out drugs to help me with my issues). After only the first few chapters(!), I felt loads and loads better!Dr. Claire Weekes has written a book in a way that soothes and relaxes you. If you are willing to try to beat your illness without psychiatric help or drug therapies, this is the book to read!She lays out fundamental principles on dealing with anxiety to relieve your agoraphobia, panic attacks, somatic illnesses, obsessions and more.Really a great book!"
5,A MUST READ AND REREAD!!!!,I should have reviewed this book months ago. Claire Weekes TOTALLY UNDERSTOOD ANXIOUS NERVES!!! This book I have in my car and at home by my bed side. If I travel I take a copy with me along with my Bible. Though it is not a Christian book I used her methods and added God word into the equation. Though I feel being a Chistian my battle was more spiritual this book along with my biblical knowledge helped me beyond words. I hope and pray other will begin to understand anxiety and nerves. I have read many books on the subject and this was the book that worked best for me. You will be surprised when you read it. You will feel you are not alone and you will see yourself being described in these pages. You can and will win this battle. Don't give up. God bless you!!!
3,Not what I expected,"This book I must say was just ok. I mean there are more updated techniques.You always learn something new with every book you read about anxiety, panic attacks & agoraphobia. Lucinda Bassett has been a great inspiration for me. I truly enjoy her techniques and way of teaching. I am glad I read this book anyways."
3,Arcane wisdom,"This book is great when it came out, but a lot of the information inside is really out of date. The terminology is funny and noone, but noone utilizes supervised sedation or ECT to treat panic disorder anymore. I recommend that the publisher revise, revise and revise before they reprint this book."
5,Hope & Help for Your Nerves,I would highly recommend this book to anyone experiencing panic attacks. It can change your life!
5,Great!,If you are having panic attacks and need help to deal with them. This book is a life saver..or it was for me!! Will explain what is happening to you and how to cope. Worth the buy!!
1,A small paperback with small (almost) illegible font.,"I have not read this book, as it was purchased as a gift. I am disappointed with it because the typeface is small & bold: making the individual letters 'bleed' together. This is not a critique of the seller, just that this printing of the book is hard to read."
2,Dull,"This book is very boring I've had it for about 3 weeks,I was reading it for awhile,but kinda got busy with school and work I think if I really liked the book I would find time to read it.I don't like how she words anxiety she calls it a ""nervous illnes"" excuse me,but I'm not ill thank you very much I know,I know don't focus so much on the wording,but I do.When I have time i'll start reading it again,maybe I'll change my review but for now.I wouldn't recommend it,it's rather boring and has a slow flow to it,meaning to me the book doesn't get to the point she goes on and on.Ugh.I bought it because all the good reviews about the book,I thought for sure I would like it,guess not."
3,Dreadful Anxiety Attacks,"This book does help a little, for Anxiety/Panic Attacks. I'm not real sure how long ago it was written. In the book it says you should not get any different symptoms than what you have already dealt with. I don't think that is true because I did produce more symptoms about 4 1/2 months into this illness. And I talked to other people and they also had different symptoms than I had that were not in the book, one lady said she went temporarly blind. That is not one of the symptoms listed in this book. And it also talked about having Nervous Breakdown's alot, which has nothing really to do with Anxiety Attacks that I know of. But it does list and talk about some of the common side effects of the illness and explains about them."
3,My experiences,"The product was delivered in a timely fashion. The cart was manufactured in China, and done in a sloppy manner. 2 bolts for the wheels were missing, and every both on the cart was loose(including self locking bolts on the wheels). After going to the hardware store to obtain the proper parts and thread locker, i proceeded to re-assemble the cart properly.Now that there are no loose or missing bolts, the cart serves my purpose well. I called customer service for WESCO, and they really didnt seem to care. Shame on you WESCO! I WONT buy one of there products again!Have American workers build your products!"
4,Great mask very comfortable. Only weakness is if can be displaced if you roll over or are a side sleeper.,Great mask very comfortable. Only weakness is if can be displaced if you roll over or are a side sleeper.
2,Try Something Else,"As a frequent airline traveler, I strive for relaxation. Don't expect to find comfort in this product. This is cotton. Look for silk and something with low pressure on your face, but that blocks all light."
2,Too bulky for side-sleeping,"I wanted to try this sleep mask because its soft, fleecy, cozy construction sounded appealing. I found the mask too bulky, making it very difficult to position comfortably for side-sleeping. It also wasn't particularly comfortable even when flat on my back. I had ordered a ""Sweet Dreams"" mask at the same time which worked much better for me (thinner construction made it easy to use for side-sleeping). I've since purchased the ""Twilight"" (also a thinner design) which is even more comfortable and room darkening for me."
1,NOT for stomach sleepers!,I bought this thinking that for $30 this must be a really special sleep mask. It's so big and obtrusive that I can't sleep on my stomach or even my side with this thing wrapped around my head. It's too thick. I'm going to send this back and stick with my $3.00 sleep mask from Target!
4,comfortable and effective,"This is the first sleep mask I've owned. It is pricey but well-packaged and well made. It's very comfortable although the velcro strap is kind of strange but again very effective. I never forget to put it on at night. There's a soft roll of cotton padding all around the edges of the inside of the mask which serves multiple purposes - it makes the mask very comfortable, there's no sweat factor, and you can open your eyes with the mask on and see utter pitch black darkness. While the mask is extremely lightweight and doesn't feel like a burden at all, it's still bulky and I find it hard to sleep on my side without knocking the mask off kilter. Because of how it moves I can usually see some light eventually, but I'm just one of those tossers and turners. Overall I think it's quite great, amazingly comfortable and highly effective in terms of blocking out light. I haven't taken a nap in it yet but that should be fun."
4,Great mask but not ideal for side sleepers...,"This mask is wonderful for naps while sitting in chairs or lying flat on your back. As a side sleeper this mask only stayed on about 50% of the time throughout the night, mainly due to its thickness. However, the thickness of the mask makes it very soft & comfortable to wear for extended periods. I use this mask for flights, naps in the car, and meditation sessions. Another benefit is that the mask is so spacious inside that it never rests on your eyes. It does get a little warm in hot weather. I love the fit of this mask. It's my second most used sleep mask. If you're a side sleeper please check out my review for Dream Essential's Escape mask.Escape Luxury Travel Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch ~ Blueberry"
4,Well crafted futuristic story,"Remains is a story about love, betrayal and greed, with a little idealism tossed in for good measure. The story takes place a century into the future and assumes we have established habitats on the moon, Mars and in the space between. It follows Mace who lost his wife to an accident but isn't convinced about the corporate line he is given and continues to dig into the details. Along the way he meets an interesting woman who unknowingly embroils him deeper into the past.The story is well-paced and is just the right mix of tech, human emotion and mystery to keep the pages turning. The ending was especially satisfying with believable twists, unlike many novels which have contrived endings. This is the first novel I have read by Tiedemann but it won't be the last."
2,Kinda.....eh,"Not very exciting...cake part actually tasted a bit stale. They just didn't seem very special...sorta like commercial snake cakes. At 50 cents a cake/bite, not worth it. At least they were pretty."
1,Author Couldn't make it as a Gay Erotica writer,"Entire book is a work of fiction, with many passages lifted from other authors' work. What made this book good, was knowing that Nasdijj experienced these events. Now, it is just a very poor work of fiction. After doing some research, ""Nasdijj"" turned out to be nothing more than a failed gay erotica writer with a jealous tint and a short temper. The previous life as a gay erotica writer shines through periodically in this book and adds a bitter tangent to a mundane piece.Get a life man; your own, preferably."
1,One Fraud Too Many,"It's a shame that because of works like this, not to mention the Forrest Carter (Education of Little Tree) scandal a few years back, many unknown and undiscovered--but authentic--Native American writers will probably have to struggle that much harder to become published. Well-established American Indian authors are already naturally suspect of any newcomers on the scene; the sad fact is that for some reason Native American culture and identity is misappropriated by more misguided white writers--whatever their individual agendas might be--than any other race or ethnic group. The sad truth is that, for every Forrest Carter and Timothy Barris who manage to secure a publishing contract, there are dozens of truly deserving Native voices that are going unheard.And thanks to these imposters making the buying public- as well as agents and editors- increasingly suspicious of anyone claiming to be Native American-their chances to be read and heard are only going to diminish."
1,A shameful fraud,"I read this book last year, and was moved by it, though I often found it rather fuzzy on certain details, and the chronology seemed to jump around. Now, I learn this guy is a total FRAUD: He's not Indian and Tommy didn't exist. He's apparently lazy, too: I've read that his descriptions of Navajo culture don't fit with reality, either. This is disgraceful, both his lying about his heritage, and inventing this sick child, as well as the other people he made up. What a waste of time.So many literary frauds have been exposed this month (Jan 06). Now, I'm wondering about a few other memoirs that have been popular the last few years. I'm rather disinclined to buy any memoirs these days; and I bet I'm not the only one who feels this way. I bet these scandals hurt sales of this book genre."
4,A POEM SET TO TEXT,"Transferring thought patterns into words of distinction is the modus operandi here and success is the ultimate result. Apparently this is the first book by Nasdijj and a winner it is. His vocabulary is outstanding and the force of his words are delightful. I did not realize what a alcoholic mother does to her forming baby, but it is terrible. Nasdijj lived in abject poverty and pulled himself up by the bootstraps by teaching at a college from time to time. He doesn't go into any of his accomplishments and I am sure that would make a fine story if told by him.This could be a very quick read, but you do slow down as you wish to savor his thought process."
5,White People Town and the Navajo Nation,"This is a powerful book--part prose, part poetry--all truth. Short sentences, long sentences. I'm familiar with the author's landscape, geographical and psychological. I was born in White People Town, son of an Indian trader, grew up there and on the Rez. Now I'm one of the white editors Nasdijj writes about. I understand Nasdijj's story. I know him, even if we've never met. Maybe, like him, I know what it's like to not be completely comfortable in either world. My older brother gave me this book and said I wouldn't be able to put it down. He was right. He knows a lot more about the reservation than I do--it is his home. So the reservation runs like a river through our dreams, and it runs like wild horses through this book. It will also run through your dreams, even if you've never been there."
1,Awful,"I would of love to really share an opinion in this section, yet the item never arrived. Thus I have a review of disgust with the providers of this particular book. I only rated one star because this review makes you rate at least one star."
2,write stuff is alright...,"Hannah has been best friends with Rachel forever. Rachel is the dream girl....so Hannah's used to being in the shadows. She's always the one running in between, carrying messages from love-struck boys back to Rachel. Then ,Hannah falls in love with Dylan, the new guy from England. But Dylan's no different from the other boys: he emails Rachel, telling her that he likes her and wants to get to know her. Rachel has Hannah write back, pretending to be her. They begin a strange triangle: Hannah loves Dylan, Dylan thinks he loves Rachel, and Rachel could care less, she's to busy flirting with everyone else. When Dylan finds out the truth, he blows up. Has Hannah lost the first guy she's ever really liked?"
3,I Couldn't Put This Book Down,"This book has a really intersting plot. It will keep you guessing all thoughout the book. I could not put this book down. There was so much going on that I needed to know. This book is probably for ages 9-12 as the words in this book are somewhat easy.Two girls, Hannah and Rachel are best friends but are very different from each other. Hannah is very smart and is very dedicated to school whereas Rachel is boy crazy. Hannah meets this new boy named Dylan. She starts to like him and is excited because he is perfect for her. The only problem, she hasn't told Rachel and she is falling for him too. Dylan starts to like Rachel so they start to date. How will Hannah get get this?"
3,Good.,"That is so strange to see on Amazon.com I wish it was better written. That is me on the cover, when I was about 12."
4,Good video,Good videos with alot of old time matches of Austin not the best austin video but well worth you checking it out.
4,band still rocks,"I love this record. Its got a little bit of everything...hard rock, spacey jams, jazzy stuff... beautiful. Welcome back."
4,Flying Colors,"Mr Leffens is an abstract artist. An artist with the power to see beyond the surface, to the essential beauty around him. It was this vision that allowed him to see through the severe physical disabilities of a group of students and witness their souls. Powerful souls, overlooked by the world but exploding with insight.Mr Leffens discovers a way for them to communicate, not in words, but in a more expressive reflection of their spirit. Given the tools to paint, these artists overcome the forces that enslave us all, limited expectations, power struggles and the jealousy of those who have stopped striving.These ""handicapped"" artists vault over their able bodied colleagues to reach heights most can only dream of. It's an inspiration and indeed, a work of art.Jeff Carlson - Sun Prairie, Wisconsin"
1,In the trash with you...,"I didn't have a problem with the story line. In fact, taken by itself, it was a great plot. However, the errors in spelling, the ""typos"", and finally the blatant factual error (Bastogne is in Belgium not France), made me crazy! Yes, I read the whole thing because I enjoyed the plot but, as soon as I was done, I got up and threw it in the trash because it would be something I'd be embarrassed to share or pass on."
5,Excellent speakers for laptop,"I received these as a gift to go along with my laptop. I have a Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2ZS Notebook sound card, and when I plug these speakers in they sound really good. I've had altec Lansig and cyber acoustic laptop speakers and these are far superior. For the money they are probably the best 2-piece laptop speakers you are going to find."
4,Red Star Rougue Review,"I found Red Star Rougue to be a very interesting book about K-129 and how it failed to launch a missle strike on Pearl Harbor so the author writes. Although the absolute truth may never be known, often truth is stranger then ficition. If you like a good cold war story you will find this book a good read."
4,Fantastic Read,"Red Star Rogue by Kenneth Sewell is the definitive work on a most terrifying event of the Cold War. As a nuclear submariner on active duty during the period the events of the book took place, we were privy to some information regarding the K-179, but hardly knew the complete series of events that surrounded the loss of the submarine. While the book is well documented, my only criticism is that much of the information is repeated numerous times, adding bulk to the story and requiring extra reading time. It could be rewritten more concisely and still tell this grim tale."
5,Credible,"I pulled my copy of The Silent War from the book shelf and read the chapter where Dr. Craven talks about K-129, the submarine featured in Red Star Rogue. I counted the times Craven mentions the status of the Soviet submarine. In chapter fifteen Dr. Craven states that the Soviet ballistic missile submarine K-129 was either rogue, or had the highest probability of being a rogue, no less than SEVEN TIMES!I'm not a submariner, but I am a retired naval officer and history buff. As far as I'm concerned, a submarine would go rogue for only two reasons, to defect or to start a war. Soviet submarine officers were the elite of the Soviet Navy, dedicated family men, loyal to a fault. I don't believe this submarine was defecting.I found that Red Star Rogue made a solid case for the failed rogue submarine attack on Hawaii. But after reading chapter 15 in Craven's book, The Hunt for Red September, I've elevated its credibility to a ranking of the highest probability."
1,This could have been a written as a decent thriller (fiction)...,"Instead, the authors claim it to be non-fiction. The book is so full of technical and chronological errors (many quite basic) that all possible credibility is destroyed. For example, the book states that the one-megaton nuclear warheads carried on the K-129's missile have a yield equivalent to 1000 tons of TNT; in reality, one megaton = one million tons TNT equivalent. Another simple, verifiable error is that the authors claim that the crews of USS Parche & USS (Richard B.) Russell received awards for their part in the K-129 recovery efforts in late 1968/early 1969. These two subs weren't even built yet! Also, the authors repeatedly use presented hypotheses as facts later in the book - a cardinal flaw in any form of deductive reasoning. The end result is just populist conspiracy theory trash."
5,Now in paperback,"Red Star Rogue sure got my full attention and I couldn't put the book down. The book says the author, Kenneth R. Sewell, is a nuclear engineer and a U.S. Navy veteran who spent five years aboard the USS Parche, a fast attack submarine that was the Navy's most decorated ship."" This New York Times best seller is a five star read, especially if you like Tom Clancy books. Seems to me tha all the Captain had to do to make the missle fail safe work is tell the wrong code to the plotters."
1,Not to beleaguer the point...,"...but two items need to be pointed out:1. China's first sub carrying nuclear weapons was put to sea in 1980. She sank. Twice. K-129 met her demise in the early 70's.2. Had the nuke detonated in the tube (as they author claims), there would be nothing to salvage.Don't waste your money."
1,Rent a movie instead.,"The many technical errors have been noted by Mr. Feldman's review. However, if the authors had wanted to write a novel, they should have. How on earth do they describe the weather, the moods, the actions of the crew without evidence to support it. Also, the Cray computers which they state the Navy owned in the 60s weren't built until the 1970s. If you want some conspiracy theory thrills, go to the video store. The co-author should maybe stick to writing stories about entertainers."
5,what about the bell,"i read the book, and also the review of mr. feldman. without going into much detail, i would like to ask mr. feldman how he explains the fact that the american delegation in moscow, handed them over the submarines bell?!. which clearly showd that they recoverd more then just the front portion.also, what is the secrecy, if this is just another cold war story, why is the goverment up in arms to protect the information, when bigger secrets have been declassified.in my humble opinion, these 2 facts are the ones wich irefutebly support mr. sewel's theory."
3,Scary theory,"Mr Sewell uses interviews and declassified papers to put together a theory explaining the sinking of a Soviet SSBN in 1968. While the facts he produces support his theory, many of his conclusions are merely conjecture. Sewell also has a bad tendency of repeating himself, giving the book the feeling of a high school history paper.All in all the book is still worth a read for the information it does contain. Hopefully in the coming years, more information on this incident will be declassified, allowing for a more detailed, and more exact explanation."
4,the usa was lucky,"all submarine stories are generally exciting and this one i could not put down. i am not sure if the story is really true, because all the actual witnnesses died, but the author goes to great lenghts to prove it. it is about a red sub that goes rouge and almost starts wwiii. what a story .."
3,An entertaining bit of not-quite non-fiction,"The authors have excellent insight into the day-to-day operations of a Soviet submarine, which alone makes the book worth reading. They are very imaginative, weaving circumstantial evidence and unrelated events into a believable story. I found the book to be fairly well written, and quite entertaining. But it is ultimately a STORY. Anyone with access to Google or more recently published books can uncover declassified photographic evidence, crew lists, and written reports that prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the authors of 'Red Star Rogue' simply have it all dead wrong. Their version of the story is so contrary to the evidence that a well-informed reader is left with the conclusion that the authors, who appear to be too well educated to have let their imaginations run this far away with them, knowingly and intentionally produced a work of utter fiction in an effort to relieve the conspiracy theory crowd of their pocket money."
5,McTell's Best,"I own a lot of McTell's albums, and I've always believed this is far and away his best. In fact, I would go out on a limb and say ""Not Till Tomorrow"" ranks with the very best contemporary folk albums of the last thirty-five years. It's nearly an hour long, and every cut on it is a first-rate example of expert song-writing craft, not to mention the performances. Two in particular--'Birdman' and 'Gypsy'--are just about as good as it gets. The mood swings from atmospheric to political to contemplative to comical and ironic effortlessly, and although McTell's voice is rather ordinary-sounding, it's expressive enough to hold its own among the sensational array of side musicians he has backing him up (and he's quite a good guitarist in his own right!). I love this album, and you will too!"
5,A Good Book for Father's Day,My granddaughter wanted this book for her father. She likes it very much and gave it to him for Father's Day. She is only eight years old but reads at a high level and enjoyed it very much.
2,kind of cheesy,"I agree with someone said below about this book being tacky. There are only a couple of patterns that I thought I might use, but really, you could probably find better variations elsewhere. If I had had a chance to look through this book in the store I wouldn't have bought it."
1,Tackiest Knitting Book Ever!,Don't waste your money. About half of the patterns use fluffy novelty yarns like paton's cha cha or boa in simple items like scarfs (a fuzzy scarf knit all in garter stitch! Does anyone really need this pattern? And a tank top made completly out of boa yarn!) You can get the same patterns for free from the ball band. There are one or 2 patterns that are alright (an afghan and I can't remember the other one). But nothing that anyoneshould be aloud to wear.
2,"cable was fine, the shipping was not","The cable was fine...but the way Crutchfield chose to ship it was environmentally wrong. They put a tiny cable in a very BIG box that was overfilled with packing peanuts. When packing peanuts are disposed of improperly (which most folks do) they will take the current of air and trash up the envoirnment. Some float out to sea where sea creatures see them and think they are food and eat them, and eventually die. Even if the peanuts are ""biodegradable"" that doesn't mean they degrade quickly or that they are edible. Too bad Crutchfield chooses products that work well for their business...but don't work well for the rest of the world. I returned the product."
5,One of my favorite shows,"I didn't discover this show until it was already cancelled. I caught it on reruns on the SciFi channel and was hooked. I watched the whole marathon and came on amazon to look for the entire series(shamefully it's only two seasons). I love the dry humor. It was on showtime but I think if it was on a channel like SciFi, it would have had a long run. I found other addicted fans who were also bummed it went off the air. I've read rumors that there's another show idea or movie in the works but I've yet to see any results from the rumor."
5,Great show but DVD ?,I got turned on to this show by my Bro. He had the complete package and I love it as much as My Name is Earl...But when I looked for a set all I could get was the separate seasons. My PS3 will not play any of the DVDs so I have a old player that would play them. I have had a few things the PS3 will not work with like amazon instant video. there are other things that slip my mind but it is a disappointment PS3 has so many limits.

2,binding fell apart,content great and highly recommended but binding fell apart in a couple of months. Highly recommended for sports medicine or ortho docs.
1,subpar,"watching the dvd is like viewing a class with little to no insight into the moves ,DVD is especially poor in regards to kumite techniches.Big disapointment"
3,The Art of Tart,"really, aren't we all just so sick and tired of this whole 'Shakespeare' craze that's been going on for the past four hundred years. Isn't it time we moved on to some more modern books like Wuthering Heights or the Great Fruit Bat? Yes, Shakespeare may ahve had an affinity for language, but with lines like, ""My zipper is down, oh me oh my, I wish I could find a suitable fly!"" or ""The wombat is dead! The wombat is dead! We've all begun to shave her head!,"" you have to begin questioning the integrity of this so called 'playwright.' Call me a tart, but these books are silly and outdated. Go read some Tolstoy."
3,Book is lightweight in comparison to the film,"Relatively, the screenplay is 173 pages and the film diary by Russell Jackson (not Branagh) is 34 pages. Branagh does furnish a short introduction. In addition there are about 30 pages of absolutely beautiful stills from the film and the filming. There are certainly better reading versions of Hamlet available, the screenplay is the full Shakespeare play so there's not much to analyze as regards to editing, the diary is not from a prominent member of the cast or crew (a filmographer I think but I am not sure of his role in this specific film), the color photographs included are spectacular and leave me wanting more but they generally are on the small side. Maybe it is handy to mark lines or scenes that are of particular interest... Mostly, I like it more for the memory of the movie (spectacular!!!) than for the book itself so unless you are an equally avid fan the book may disappoint."
5,Hamlet and Ken,This is a great supplement to go with the best and most complete Hamlet ever made. Video is excellent. In my top 100
1,"I had 3 of these explode within a year, almost caught drapes on fire!","I purchased two, the first exploded just outside the 1 year warranty (litterally, like fireworks) and the second exploded just within warranty and got replaced. I then had the new replacement 3rd one that exploded within a year and this one actually shortly caught fire... I wrote to the company about the fire, and they didnt even bother to respond to me to appologize."
3,PLEASANT BUT AVERAGE,"THE INVISIBLE RING is a nice adventure/love story expanding on Anne Bishop's BLACK JEWELS world. It's a fairly pleasant but average story about a slave, male, being used as a pleasure slave who 's journey it is to regain his honor and self respect, oh and yes find true love on the way.The story itself is fairly pedestrian but the world Ms. Bishop has created is anything but. It's a fascinating mixture of magic, caste social structure and firm if not unbreakable gender roles. The characters are interesting and well developed, the plot somewhat predictable but with enough twists and turns to make it interesting.This is a good story but not a great one. But so what. How many really great stories are there? It is not the caliber as her Tir Alainn books but still not bad. It's a relatively short, pleasant read and I certainly RECOMMEND it."
3,Mediocre Prequel to the Black Jewels Triology,"The Invisible Ring falls short of the Black Jewels Triology, the series to which this book is a prequel. The characters are not as three dimensional and vibrant as the characters in the Black Jewels Triology. However, they are not flat either. I would reccommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Anne Bishops other novels, but would reccomend anyone who is new to Bishop to first read the Black Jewels Triology as it is by far her best series and most fantastic work.The advantages to reading The Invisible Ring is that you get more of a background on Dameon Sadi an important character in the Black Jewels Triology. You see what he suffered while enslaved, and how he managed to circumvent the system. This books is a good read, it just falls short when compared to the Triology that it is supposed to precede."
1,The cover looked good,"When I finished this ( i use the word lightly ) book I ripped it up and threw it in the garbage. I have read a ton of books some I like, some I don't, hardly ever do I feel this strongly about about one. This book has nothing to recommend it. The characters are weak the plot is old and overused and worst of all badly told. I read stories that are not original but nonetheless well told, not this one. I felt cheated the art on the cover was the best part of the book and it was not worth my seven dollars."
1,Not her best work,"I am truly disapointed. I had been expecting a master piece from this book the moment I laid my eyes on it, I am a big Anne Bishop fan, her books are usually detailed to the point that you find your self in them, this one was a dissapoint. She seemed to hurry on this book, she normally pours her heart into it, this time she didnt. Weak plot, not origimal mais character. If you really want a Master Piece from this author try The Black Jewels trilogy, now THAT is a master piece."
4,Not a reflection of Bishop books,If this book is your first introduction to Anne Bishop then please don't pass judgement on the author based on this book. I would have given it three and a half stars but bumped it up to four only because Bishop's other books are so good. Put this book aside until you've read all of Bishop's other books and are dying for more.
1,disappointing,"The author's first book was intriguing and introduced a few characters that I immediately wanted to read more about. I have been disappointed with her subsequent books however -- the prose is unimaginative (some words & phrases are overused) and the plots were not captivating (because they were not as tight and/or contained annoying implausibilities). I conjecture that her first book was so successful that her subsequent books have been rushed through with less revisional work than would otherwise have been required by the editorial staff. If you feel similarly about her initial trilogy, I am sorry to say that I would recommend not buying this book."
3,"she's a great writer, and blessed be, she tries hard on this","well, eddings daughter did it again. she may not be their biological daughter, but in all aspects she is, in the dark jewels, she discribes luthvian as polgara, but in this one belarr, and belar? come on, you're showing your roots. but just like david eddings, in this book it took you 100 pages just to clear your throat. I loved her previous series, and had high expectations, especially after reading the online preview. i'm not saying that i didn't like it, it had it's moments, but it could have been alot better.unfortunately, i think it was more editors than writer who changed this one to what it was. give it 100 pages, it might grab you again around page 90.may the darkness guide, protect and keep you"
4,Darkly Provacative and Seductive.,"Mmmm...this is one of those books you can't put down. It reveals a deeper, darker side of the nature of man. While it is not, in context, one of the best peices of literature you can find...far from it...it has an interesting plotline that makes it difficult to stop reading. Also, the end makes you want more...what happens to the characters afterwards? I definately recommend it for people who like hardcore fantasy with a lighter edge."
2,Slightly disappointed,"For the record, I was completely enthralled by the Dark Jewels series. I had been looking forward to The Invisible Ring for months before it hit the stores, and kept track of its publishing dates through Amazon.com, ( )and the Penguin Putnam publishing group--and bought it the first day it was available. While not a bad book by any means, The Invisible Ring fails to live up to Ms. Bishop's first trilogy. The characters are less interesting, and the plot more predictable. Unlike the first series that led the reader through a complicated world of dangerous predators and luscious descriptions, this one reads more like a romance novel with a fantasy plot thrown in. Buy it, but don't expect as much."
5,It can't be discontinued !!!,I understand that this product with it's additional shades has or is going to be discontinued. You are the only place I could find stock. Thank you.
4,good 1st step towards freedom to live your own life,This has the basic info to aid you in your first step towards financial and personal freedom. The details are sparse (as the info frequently changes) but the road is clearly outlined.
1,A Good Theory But Not Worth The Money,Dr. W.G. Hill promotes an interesting five flag theory in this book. Flag 1: Passport/citizenship. Get a second passport/citizenship. Flag 2: Business. Have your business profits retained in a different country. Flag 3: Domicile. Domicile in a tax haven. Flag 4: Assets. Keep assets in a different country. Flag 5: Playground. This is where you spend your time. That sums it up. Do not buy this book for an outrageous amount of money.
5,great classic,Wonderful children's book of the past. A classic story that teaches a lesson. The children enjoyed it very much as always.
5,Great book,My grandkids love this story. The art work is great. I so enjoy sharing a little piece of what I loved to do as a child.
4,Delightful Little Book,My Grandmother read this book to me when I was very young and am thrilled to be able to now read it to my little Grand daughter.
4,More of the story as I remember it ...,"I must have taken this story to heart, because I've let it influence my life (and the name of my business). But I've had a tough time finding the right combination of the traditional story in a deluxe edition. I was pleased to find the story so simply told and enjoyed the illustrations -- it's a Little Golden Book after all. It's a little too disposable to make a proper gift, but great for bedtime storytelling."
2,Landscape?,"I ordered this on the Kindle. Now, I'm new to Kindle so I may be wrong... but, this book will not let you rotate it to Portrait mode. The text is super tiny. Your stuck having to magnify the image and scooting it around to see the whole picture and text. So, might not be the best book for Kindle. It is readable, though barely, in Landscape mode."
4,Child Loves it But Ending Seems Lonely,"My daughter (almost 3) absolutely loves this book. She has a lot of fun repeating ""Not I"" and ""And She Did"" which are recurring sentences in this short book. The illustrations are whimsical and delightful. The only issue I have is that when the hen does all the work alone and then eats the bread, she is basically sitting alone eating a whole loaf of bread. Are there no family/friends she wants to share it with? And then it shows her going to bed all alone too. I know this is a classic story and the moral is that he who works will eat and not he who loafs, but it seems like it is also saying that the hardworkers end up enjoying the fruits of their labor alone. I know, I am reading too much into it. My daughter does adore it and the illustrations are too cute."
3,"not what I expected, but good","when it was released from the ""orginal"" printers.. the opening edge was not clean cut flush. Other then that it looked new.. It will be fine for a 20 month old toddler. I was just surprised, I don't remember, what condition of the book was, in the ad .. ( but I'm sure it wasn't sold as ""excellent"" condition ) something leaser."
1,Cheap and it shows,"I ordered this for my son because it was the first book I ever read. It is a really cheaply made book, I should have went to the bookstore."
4,my review rulz!!!!!!!,"This very cheerful story shows the childern that if they don't work they will not be able to reap the rewards. It is about a hen who finds a grain of wheat. She wants to grow the wheat but no one will help her, so she decides to do it all herself. the pictures are also very colorful and detailed. Everytime is see the pictures I see something new. this book is a must for young children because it teaches them responsability, and to do there share of the work. I really enjoyed this book and im sure your children will to.By Grant (who rulz!!!!)"
5,The Little Red Hen,"What a wondeful story about the values of sharing, working and team work! This story was one from my childhood. The lessons one can learn from it apply even more today than they did 50 years ago! This story and Little Butterball (which is no longer in print but should be)are timeless. Enjoy it with your child(ren) today!"
5,better than going to the store!,"I just received the book today. I'm so happy because wanted to give this book and a doll house to my granddaughters on Sunday. I've always loved this book for its object lesson, and I think the girls will just enjoy it because they love books. Oh, did I mention that it was brand new, I'm not sure I was expecting that, so that was an added bonus. All this, and I didn't even have to leave my home."
4,YogaWorks for Everybody:Beginners AM/PM,"Even though I've done yoga for years, this was still a workout and the instructorgave easy-to-follow instructions. Her voice was soothing and the choice of posesa true sampling of all the yoga options."
4,Beginner am/pm,"I like the slow am/pm sections, have not tried the long workout, no time yet. I am having trouble going directly to the short workouts on my dvd player. can someone tell me what I should do to go directly to the am or pm section without ff the entire 45 minutes. I'm not too technical. thanksMary F"
2,Yoga Works for Everybody: Beginners AM/PM,Would not have purchased if I'd known poses were mostly sun salutation. That has been done to death.
1,YogaWorks for Everyone Beginners AM/PM,This DVD was not that easy. I am in my fifties and found it very hard to sit with my legs crossed in front of me. It is very hard to get in some of these positions if you are not that flexible and have never done it before.
5,Beginning Again,"I've done yoga on and off for 13 years -- mostly off for the past year +. This DVD has gotten me back into a regular practice, and is reawakening me to the wholesome benefits of yoga and meditation! Love it."
4,Kreator Continues the Destruction!,"A long time folower of Kreator, this release saw the band further progressing through the evolution of their aggressive style of thrash-metal. ""Coma Of Souls"" immediately grabs you from the gonads and never lets go. The opening track is one of the band's finest ever and the overall production is superb. The band play the tightest and heaviest metal to date on this release. Excellent riffing and powerful drumming will leave you breathless. One of the bands best ever."
1,Ugly edition,"I hope to have a better product. I trust you, ever, but this time you sell to me a CD which edition has much to imporve."
2,Buyer beware,"The unit itself works well, however beaware that deet will melt your unit, both the screen and the case. Also after about one year of use my SportTrac had a catastrophic software failure in the field. Apparently, the unit must have a map loaded to work as a GPS unit and my map apparently suddenly became corrupted. Currently, I am unable to load any new maps or perform a software upgrade... making my unit a paper weight. I do not know if Garmin suffers similar issues, but frankly as a life safety equipment this is not acceptable. Lastly, I found Magellan's customer service to be totally crappy...for example the customer service rep saying essentially obviously putting a chemical like gasoline on your unit voids its warranty... my response was DEET is approved to put on ones skin... I did not put gasoline on the unit... Magellan pretty much said to bad... so I would not recommend this unit."
3,"careful, it's already obsolete",Nice working unit but I wouldn't buy one now. The new topo software for the sportrak units (topo 3d USA) doesn't work with the sportrak map. The older mapsend topo USA is no longer in production. Kinda stinks that the software is obsolete while they are still selling the hardware.
1,no,The seller did not mention that this device was missing the battery pack and charger so it was a real was of time and money. The price of the battery alone was more than the price I paid for the GPS. So I could have purchased a new one and been done with it. Total was of time and money
3,SporTrak Map,"Of the four hand held receivers I've used, the SporTrak Map was the first one that I used extensively and I was very pleased with it for over a year, until it quit working for no apparent reason. I sent an email message to Magellan support explaining the problem and received a reply saying that `it sounds like you'll need to send in the unit for repair.' No address or instructions were given as to where or how I was to send it. I sent two additional email messages requesting further instructions, but I never received a reply. I then phoned Support twice and was put on hold for such a long time that I gave up. Other than an inelegantly designed external cable connector and terrible customer support, the SporTrak Map would have been a very good receiver for the price. Oh, except that it failed to function after about a year."
3,Good Unit - But Lacking Critical Feature,"This is a great GPS except for the fact that it does not have the capability to guide you to a location along roads or routes that you create, or that came with the [] software. Don't buy the software because the GPS will not lead you anywhere based on the thousands of roads....it would be just as useful to use a paper map. Other than that, its great."
1,This is a waste of $$!,"There are a ton of parts, mostly flimsy plastic and cardboard. It is a pain to assemble and does not stay together. VERY disappointed in this product."
4,a witty look the glamorous world of Indian cinema,"Tharoor once again dazzles his reades with a look into the seedy life of Indian moviemaking. He deftly captures the sex, intrigue and all out ridiculousness of the world's largest movie industry. As someonw who has visited India many times, I enjoyed the author's portrayal of the actor's and actresses's charmed life. A great read"
4,"Great Quotes, but ...","This book has been one of my daily prayer books for close to ten years. The quotes are beautiful, powerful and short -- just right for the purpose of meditating on one per day.However, the thoughts are not in logical sequence. For example, quotes on humility and confession are spread over a few chapters and the rationale/need for humility is not put upfront first, followed by the attributes of humility and how one can practice it."
2,Caveat emptor,"Ferguson's research is impressive and the work certainly provides information on the period. That said, in truth what we have here is another Bible Dictionary, albeit one that casts a very wide net. However, the buyer should not order the book with the thought of reading it from cover to cover. A good read it is not; most dictionaries are not. As a study, the reader had been better served were the author to have developed the material suggested by the book's title. What we have tends more toward pastiche, a dictionary of sorts in which ""Greek Entertainment"" appears before ""Greek Athletics."" I pity the student who has to read this as a required text."
2,"As a source of protestant view on the 4th century BC to 4th century AD, YES, otherwise NO","I had hard to find anything about the veneration of saints, which I think would be important to include with a comparison to other religions of the period and earlier. In this book there's remarkably little on the actual original backgrounds of christianity, a religion composed from sources and not all that inventive uninformed people tend to think."
5,Background To New Testament Times,"This work, now in its third edition, remains the best and most comprehensive textbook available about the world in which the New Testament was born. Just about every subject you would want to know about is included, such as writing in the ancient world, apocryphal literature and Hellenist and Roman philosophy in addition to political history. It contains charts, photographs and maps. The bibliographies are excellent and not too long.Another work, which covers some of the material but is a bit more manageable in length is Jeffers' THE GRECO-ROMAN WORLD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT ERA."
3,Interesting twist on a basic game,"This is a very basic search and find game -- and not a very difficult one. However the unusual 'surround' graphics add real interest. One word of warning: my granddaughter who gets car sick absolutely cannot play this game, cannot even be near the monitor when someone else is playing. It gives her instant nausea! I guess that speaks to the great quality graphics. So beware, if you are inclined to motion sickness, this will not be the game for you."
5,A must read for parents and teachers.,"This book not only describes the symptoms of depression, but also gives parents a plan to ""rescue"" their children. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is highly readable and understandable."
5,"Sobering, powerful, and essential","The Depressed Child: A Parent's Guide To Rescuing Kids is a book written to empower parents who feel helpless in understanding the negative self-images and unhappy emotions that affect their children. Author Dr. Douglas Riley is a clinical psychologist who specializes in child and adolescent psychology, who has operated a private outpatient clinic since 1994; here, he presents parents with clear, detailed, easy-to-understand information about adolescent depression and what to do about it. Topics include how to overcome the ""I'm inferior"" myth; how to handle the ""miniature marriage"" phenomenon in teen dating relationships and providing consolation when these ""marriages"" fail; and how to evaluate and select from the methods to manage a child's depression. Sobering, powerful, and essential to understanding the mind of a depressed adolescent, The Depressed Child is highly recommended."
4,Did the job,"It's a big bag of bran! It was in good shape, and made good bran muffins. The bag contains more bran that I can use in a year though."
5,Meeting God....,"I seen this movie for the first time on August 21,2012. I'm very near and dear to God. I have all the books,devotions,and bibles I can have about him. I know this is a movie... But I saw him him tonight. I know this sounds wierd. Not visually because of the movie but supernaturally. I've been going through things lately. This movie made my situations so clear. Think God.I absolutely love this movie. I can't wait to have a child to share this with. Im filling sooo filled with God right now..... SOOO in love with God right now.... This is a must see."
3,I'll stick with the classic Stash Chai....,"I discovered Chai tea a couple of years ago and it quickly became one of my favorite drinks. I loooove Chai! But evidently I am a purist when it comes to the flavor that I expect from Chai because I really disliked most of the varieties in this box. The vanilla and classic were the only flavors that I will drink now that I have tried them all, though my husband really enjoys all but the green tea chai. I expected a more potent version of classic from the double chai and instead was overwhelmed with cinnamon, and I really like cinnamon! The Holiday chai is okay, but the rum flavor is very heavy to me. I won't repurchase, I guess I am best off with the amazingly delicious classic Chai from Stash!"
3,added flavoring is too strong,"I was disappointed with this Chai Tea Sampler. Every variety has flavorings added, like ""Cinnamon Flavor,"" which completely overpowers any of the ingredients in the tea both in taste and fragrance. A good chai tea doesn't need flavor additives, the flavor is supposed to come from all the spices put into it. But here you can't even taste the actual spices even though the other ingredients in here seem to be good. If all you want is a very pungent tasting tea, you might like this - if you add enough honey and milk to it, it can still be a pleasant drink - but if you want something that has more of a natural and balanced chai tea flavor, look elsewhere."
2,What a waste..,"What a waste of Andrew Lin, this film was very boring. The only reason I gave it two stars is one, because Andrew Lin looked absolutely gorgeous, and the second star is because he showed a litte skin."
2,Plenty of research - wish more time had been spent on the writing!,"Chip Carlson has certainly done his research for this book. Unfortunately, he hasn't brought it all together in a cohesive and readable manner. His narrative often meanders on tangents that are superfluous to the story, filled with anecdotes and trivia, that while demonstrating Carlson's keen grasp of his subject matter, add little to the story of Tom Horn. If you are looking for a first-read about Tom Horn, this is not the book for you. On a positive note, the book does have a good collection of vintage photographs of many of the personalities and settings involved in the Tom Horn saga."
1,Ive never read anything this poorly written.,"Although this book seems to contain a well documented, and at times, interesting account of Tom Horn and the Nickell murder, its about as much fun to read as a treatise on the history of linear-regression analysis. Mr. Carlson's poorly constructed syntax and meandering story lines makes this book a ""plodding"" experience."
3,Pronunciation,I am not fully satisfied with the 'Audio' part of the SEMD as we click to hear the word pronunciation. Some words are abruptly ended without being fully pronounced. Think something wrong with the audio editing. Further spell-check could have been included as part of this Dictionary as most people refer to Dictionaries not only for the 'meaning' but also for the correct spelling of the words too. I personally can't afford to buy another edition for spell-check of medical terms alone!Stephen
5,Diana King tells all...,"...that she wants a Shy Guy, that's the ""kind of guy who will always be mine."" This is the first CD I bought off of amazon.com and it's such a great song! I like Diana's mix of R&B and Reggae, hence her Jamaican influences. The remixes after it are okay, but not exactly something to write a novel about. Her successor hit single was a remake of ""Say A Little Prayer"", from the movie ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" It seems as if Diana's hit singles both came from movies (""Shy Guy"" also coming from the ""Bad Boys"" sound track). Hopefully she will release something in the future...perhaps a collaboration with U.S. Jamaican favorite Shaggy? I think they would sound Perfect together! Well, if you heard this song on the radio pick this one up. One of the best songs of the 90's."
1,"Didn't ""do the trick"" for me or my son","If you are looking for simple tricks that can be put together and performed in a few minutes,then look elsewhere. I decided to purchase this book for my 9 yr old son based on all of the positive reviews.Maybe I received a different version than these other people? What I do know is most of the tricks are involved,and require lots of practice (I'm talking hours of practice to get it right). All I wanted was something I couldenjoy with my son and this book definitely did not accomplish that."
4,just ok,Nothing special here. Most of these tricks can be seen on U tube or magic tricks revealed sites. Good for beginner magician. More of an introductory type of book. Nothing new or exciting here.
4,The Klutz Book Of Magic,This book teaches you the basics of magic. It includes everything you need to know from card tricks to small illusions. This book is great for beginners of magic. I am a magician and I loved this book. One of the reasons this book is great for everyone is because it includes all the props you need! Also for the serious magician the Klutz Book of Magic (The Movie) is a great companion for visual learners. Buy them both today
4,"The best, but a lost prop","I just loved the book, the contents were wonderful,and they provided all of the props, but I bought the book, and it was without a prop. I think that you should clearly lable at the top that there is five props, instead of having it in tiny print in the back. Just a suggestion."
3,Nothing special,"I was very impress with the item when I recvd my haircut with these products, but when I used them at home. Nothing special it didn't soften my hair as when I it was used at the salon. =("
2,Not the Greatest,"This case is nice and tight, but too tight. Once on I was unable to use any of my buttons to make a call or do anything on the phone. Also, when you put the case on it turned the speakerphone on and you couldn't turn it off unless you took the case off. I now did take a kitchen knife to cut openings for the buttons on the phone so that everything is in working order. Things are good then, but not when you first open it up to put it on. If you are willing to do a little cutting, it is fine. I have the V3c phone."
5,very pleased son,"I purchased the watch as a gift to my son who had chosen a different Brazil soccer watch which turned out to be unavailable so I found this watch on your site. My son was very pleased with the watch. It is very attractive, shipping was on time even though it was the holiday. The quality of the watch was as depicted. I would definitely order from the site in the future due to receiving fast service and a great product."
4,Early Numeracy: Assessment Teaching and Intervention,This book clarifies what children really need to know. It gives testing tools and methods of intervention. It helped me to be more specific and set individual goals for the children in my class. I think it is a great resource.
2,Not that great.,"This product was less than what I expected. As far as craft kits go, this one is cheaply made and difficult to use. My 13 yr old daughter, who is pretty ""crafty"", could not make one decent-looking bracelet with this kit. Save your money and go to your local craft store to find something better."
3,friendship bracelets,"This product is just a cheap piece of plastic, but my daughter seems to enjoy trying to figure it out."
4,Very fun to make at any age,"I am 29 years old and wanted to create friendship bracelets for my friends as a Christmas gift. These were super popular when I was in grade school so I thought the idea would be nostalgic and heartfelt. My friends LOVED the bracelets I made and are wearing them everyday. I had a blast making them and once you figure out the pattern on the wheel, they are super easy to make. Now trying to figure it out the first time is a little tough but if an 8 year old can figure it out then adults should be able to as well. I bought a 2nd kit with new patterns and am still making them!"
2,bad instructions,I finally gave up trying to understand the instructions and just did it the old fashioned way and pinned it to my pants.
2,friendship bracelet craft kit,A little disappointed. It appeared to be bigger online. I had seen something retail and had it envisioned differently. Still it was received well and will keep little girls entertained.
3,Friendship Bracelet Kit,When this arrived it was smaller than I thought it would be. I also found this same item on sale for half the price in a local bookstore.
3,we had a little difficulty with the knots,"bought these for my grand daughters and we all sat down to make them., insturcitons were a little unclear as to making the knots and attaching...but we did get a wearable bracelet out of it and the girlswere very happy."
5,More people should know this story.,"The story that is told here should be made into a movie so more people could know what happened. My father, Lt jg Jos. C. Bates, served as CDC operator on the USS Sealion that torpedoed the Japanese vessel carrying the prisoners of war. There was no way of knowing it was a ship full of Australian and British POWs. The USS Sealion and the USS Pampanito rescued as many as they could carry within the limited confines of WWII submarines. My dad had nightmares of this incident the rest of his life, still hearing the shouts of the men in the water calling out to them ""Over here! Over here!"" He took the photograph that was used to design the jacket of the book, although the artist's rendering is somewhat different than his snapshot."
3,"on upgrading your firmware, be careful","One word of caution. It's very easy to upgrade the firmware on the Magellans. But nowhere on the ""readmes"" for the sportrak pro upgrade did it tell the user to keep both the com port and the GPS at 4800 baud (esp. since the GPS can be set for 115,200! You can totally hose the flash memory and firmware by running the upgrade at ANY baud rate > 4800. You CAN go through an arcane series of ""keystokes"" to get the GPS back into ""upgrade"" mode..but it's a pain.."
2,Critical Deficiency,I returned this unit because of an inaccurate trip odometer and will probably replace it with the Garmin GPSMap. The accuracy of the odometer on my Sportrak was off by about 20% at walking speeds. Try the following test: drive a one mile course away from and back to your home with the unit on the car dashboard. You will find quite close agreement (within a couple of percent) of the odometer reading on your car and the Sportrak. Now walk the same course holding the unit in your hand. My unit would record approximately 0.8 miles on the odometer on the same 1 mile course. I have conducted this experiment with a Garmin unit (the Foretrex 201) and found this unit to have the same accuracy at walking speeds as at highway speeds. Since I wish to use the system for mostly walking speed trips the Sportrak was unacceptable to me.
3,Internal Map Not Accurate,"This is my third GPS and I generally like the features and screens. The built-in map, however, is terrible. It contains major errors that are inexcusable. For example, the Parks Highway - the main route from Anchorage to Denali is labled as another highway. Roads and trails in Denali also way off. Near our home in Arizona, the Map calls the Verde River the Salt River, which is nearby, but way different for navigation purposes. Mapsend maps are better - but not good enough to rely on 100%, which is what you want in a GPS. Magellan could solve this problem by spending a little more for higher quality maps."
2,Easily Broken,Chain broke off the stud after first removal from ear. Very flimsy and metal fatigued easily.
1,Who Knows?,"I wanted to review this DVD. I really wanted to pre-order this DVD, but there is not enough information in the description. Andromeda Season 3, Volume WHAT? If this is volume 3.4, I would really like to order it. Unfortunately, I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING! What's the deal with this description? Just a bit vague, don't you think?"
3,I know,"I agree with John Keitz, there is not enough information about this DVD. However if you click on the picture you can see that it is Season 3 Collection 4 (well atleast according to the picture)."
5,excellent New Years concert with von Karajan,This is wonderful New Year's concert with probably the greatest oonductor of the century bitting farewell! Kathleen Battle is quite excellent too. I can watch this every year and never tire of the love for the occasion. The Vienna philharmonic never lets down. It is a special New year's cellebration. The best of all!!!!
2,Spendid concert but inferior video picture quality,The concert is probably the best Vienna new years concert ever. But I was very disappointed with the picture quality. What a pitty.
1,Get the Carlos Kleiber,Not at all impressive when you have the likes of Carlos Kleiber conducting the Vienna Philharmonic in the same repertoire on DVD. The orchestra responds with allot more finesse to Kleiber.
3,"Decent activities, misleading title","This book is NOT a book of complete lesson plans, as I thought it was; I was thrown into teaching a new class and curriculum this year, and thought it might be helpful. I don't want to knock the book too much, because the activities are cute, short, and to the point. But the title ""180 Daily Lessons"" isn't necessarily what you think it might be; even an average middle school class will probably knock off these activities in less than half an hour, and if you teach a double block, this is nowhere near a full lesson. Forewarned is forearmed."
2,"It is alright, but not right for my use.","At first I rated this a 3, but now find I won't be using it. It is not right for my use. It is designed in sets of 5, one for each day of the week, rather than 180 separate activities. The school year is not arranged in nice neat 5 day weeks. It starts on a Tuesday, and gets days off here and there, throwing those nice, neat 5 day bundles off. I went with using Daily Warm-Ups instead.My big complaint is Amazon shipping. I had free shipping, so was slower. But, when I checked 5 days after ordering, it hadn't even been shipped! So, I changed the shipping, paid and it went out that same day. Free shipping is fine, but not if you don't ship!"
5,Made my 4yr old happy.,I received exactly what I thought I was getting. The shirt is made of a nice fabric with a very detailed design. It has held up to my 4yr old wearing it constantly since he's gotten it.
2,review,"this is a good picture book, but very little real information is provided. Although more expensive yefim gordan's other book on the Su-25 is a much better book. it contains a great wealth of information that the Russian Aircraft in Action book does not. although inexpensive this book i feel is not worth it."
2,Broken,"The petit fours were received on time, but 1/2 of them were broken and the fondant was cracked. They were essentially trash. The taste was fine, but they did not look like the picture."
3,Rare and Important Documentation of Welles' Later Years,"Yes, this shot-on-video documentary is rough around the edges. If you're turned off by that, by all means stay away from not only this documentary, but all of Welles' films after 1958. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a film that tells you what this great artist was up to in his later years, while he was creatively strong as ever, but unable to find financing or studio support,this film is for you. There are interviews here with, among others, filmmaker and Welles friend Peter Bogdanovich and Frank Marshall (who worked with Welles on his unreleased ""The Other Side of the Wind"" before going on to form Amblin Entertainment with Steven Spielberg). It's not a perfect film, and not all of the people interviewed are as important to Orson Welles' life and career as one would hope, but if you admire Welles body of work I can't recommend it highly enough."
1,a badly made attempt at a tribute to a great artist,"What a pity that such an extraordinary man should be shown in such a shallow, pitiful light. Where did Mr Graver pretend to learn how to make documentaries? It is a disgrace to see Orson Welles in such a cheap and bad film. I trust we will see no more works of Mr Graver, but hopefully someone else will produce a documenmtary worthy of it's subject in the not to distant future."
3,Working with Orson Welles,"Apparently intended to be an audition tape for the opportunity to edit and release one of Orson Welles last movies, The Other Side of the Wind, cinematographer Gary Graver's WORKING WITH ORSON WELLES is a moderately entertaining look at Welles from about 1970 to his death in 1985.Cameron Mitchell and Peter Bogdanovich are about the only two immediately recognizable celebrity interviewees. Some of the Wellesian anecdotes are amusing, and there's a bit with Welles doing a magic act on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson that's kind of fun, but for the most part this one goes nowhere slow. The highlight is the twelve-minute preview for another late Welles film that never got as far as a final cut - F is for Fake. Even Welles devotees should proceed with caution."
5,Don't Squat with yer Spurs On . . .,"That saying and many others your dad used to dish up are all listed in reference form in ""More Texas Sayings..."" You want to know how to tell someone to get lost? Look up ""Unwelcome,"" and find, ""As welcome as... an egg suckin' dog, an outhouse breeze, and a porcupine at a nudist colony."" All right, so there were a few missing, like my dad's personal favorite, regarding why undesirable people still manage to get hitched- ""There's a butt for every saddle."" And there's a phrase to suit every person in ""More Texas Sayings..."""
1,How did he return it?,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
5,The Jeweler's Directory of Decorative Finishes,"This is absolutely the best book I have used to help me learn about Patination, enameling, engraving, inlay, granulation, chasing, repousse, reticulation and much more. The book was very well set up and easy to understand for a beginner, like me. I highly recommend this book. It is a great value."
5,Love this book!,This book has so many great swatch samples of gorgeous techniques and finishes. Clearly organized and well written. Includes minimal instruction on how to achieve all the finishes but serves more to educate and inspire.
1,Not mini and Not what's pictured,"The pan isn't what is in the picture. It also doesn't seem ""mini"" to me. It also feels cheap."
3,Cute,"This book contains very basic patterns (lots of sweatshirts, some hats and toys)with neat designs and colors knit in. The clothes are cute and probably very appropriate for the older children (5-8) that the patterns are knit for. However, I don't foresee using this book much at all, and probably wouldn't have purchased it if I had been able to flip through it first."
2,Too many animals and blankets,"I bought the book because I liked the title but was very disappointed. The book has too many animals and baby blankets and few really clothes for children. The title promises more. I have knitted one of the sweaters, but I am not inspired to knit anymore from this book. The layout could have been good if the drawings had been better. Grete"
3,"Cute, but Out of Style and Impractical","I purchased both of Lucinda Guy's books, this one as well as AND SO TO BED. Both have some very sweet little items and toys, but overall are not worth the $$ each one cost. The clothing is simply out-dated, seemingly from another time and era and way of life. I have kept the books because they are just quaint, but primarily for the toy patterns."
3,De Todas Maneras Rosas,"This album is incredible, superior arrangement and composition. One of his best albums, My reason for the 3 stars is because of the terrible sound quality. Emusic did a terrible job on this one (Very Surprised). They obviously did this one from vinyl but obviously a dusty and not so good copy. High hiss is noticeable from the begining till the last track.That is pretty pathetic coming from the fania vault and universal latino. they should have did this one from the master tape or reconstructed another master disc lp from the original. I am going to have to wait till the Codigo copy is released, and who knows when that will be. Codigo is terribly slow and dont know anything about salsa or The Fania label at that.Better mastering and this album will get a 5 star in my book. If you have the vinyl and know how to clean your record properly, remaster and transfer your own copy.That is what iam going to do."
1,TAI CHI FUNNY DRAGONS,"THIS MOVIE HAS 2 FUNNY, BUT SIMPLE ACTORS, ONE PLAYING A CON MAN AND THE OTHER, A SIMPLETON. ONE RULES AND THE OTHER FOLLOWS. UNTIL THEY MEET A MAN WITH A VENDETTA AGAINST THE RULERS WHO KILLED HIS BROTHER. HE FINDS THESE TWO CRAZED, OUT OF THEIR MINDS, IDIOTS TO TRAIN AND HOPE THAT THEY DO RIGHT, BY HIM, IN HIS QUEST FOR REVENGE FOR THE KILLING OF HIS FAMILY. THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS GOOD. THE QUALITY OF THE STORYLINE WAS O.K. BUT THE MOVIE LACKS TRUE EXCITEMENT UNTIL THE END. THEY FIGHT AND ONCE THEY HAVE DEFEATED THE ENEMY, ONE PERISHES, LEAVING THE ONE WHO FOLLOWED TO CONTINUE ON. THIS MOVIE IS O.K. BUT I GIVE IT A 2 1/2 STARS. IT IS NICE FOR A COMEDY COLLECTION BUT NO BLOOD AND GUTS."
1,"Ethics in Health Services Management, 5th Edition",This book did not come with the access code that they said was part of the selling point of this book. Very upset and poor advertising.
1,Thoughts on the work!~!~!,Just a colection of platitudes. Simpistic solutions!~!~!l He is very one sided about world religions. Fallenness realy has no meaning
4,"Recommended for Trevor, Waugh or DeVries readers","Those familiar only with Trevor's brilliant and haunting examinations of everyday worlds and lives may be as surprised as I was to uncover this early work. At first, you may be unsure that this is, indeed, Trevor; the droll humor, the bizarre story of equally offbeat characters, will perhaps make you think it is Evelyn Waugh in your hands. You will follow the adventures of a young man through the world of romance journalism, and marvel at the lack of Trevorian dimension in the people. But take heart. It is raw for the master, but it is fascinating to see the first threads of his later skill appear. And it's very, very funny."
1,I wish to put negative 5,"OK this movie is one example of low budget movies.The movie has no plan,bad camera angles,and it looks like the most student movie of all time.The fight seen tries to do editing but its wack.WHY,cause the movie is so low-budget that they can filter the sound effect to make it look like if he break his arm or shot him.OK,I will give this movie a break.But hey,this movie is not worth (the amount)(...)"
5,Really cute headboard,This headboard is so nice. Order it with the twin mates bed. Great storage sections and nice curve to the top. My daughter absolutely love is and has already filled the cubbies
1,True Witness,"Made a mistake buying this book, as well as the others by Jo Bannister. I do not recommend it.Linda Sheean"
5,Unique approach to eating disorders,"Reading this book has been wonderful for me. It provides survival tools in the form of stories and metaphors so they are easy to remember and call on when in distress. It separates weight from the issue, and suggests a more holistic and psychological approach toward resolution.I recommend this for anyone who suffers from anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder or compulsive eating disorder."
4,Not just for job seekers...,"This is a great guidebook to jumpstarting your networking process especially if you don't know where to begin to build a network. Whether you want career or personal support, this book offers examples that any reader can easily relate too. Quick and easy read filled with nuggets of good advice."
4,Great Book.,I am a Chemical Engineering student and I purchased this book along with its solutions manual (highly recommended) and I was very satisfied the problems were worked out thoroughly and the math was not byzantine at all. I highly recommend this book
4,good text,"This is a good text. It is not at as high level as most other popular p-chem textbooks. If you think this text is too hard, then forget about the p-chem texts by Atkins or McQuarrie. You might want to get a copy of Physical chemistry by Ball or the one by Engel and Reid to clarify some materials. I don't think any p-chem text is necessary better than others. Each has its own strenghs and weaknesses. How well you do in this course will also depend on your preparedness to take it. Many students are not well prepared to take p-chem. Therefore they blame the textbook, their teacher, and everything they can think of in the universe and beyond for not doing well in this course."
3,Text,"This is a great text book, but the text created by the author is too long for use in my Thermodynamics class."
3,OK,"I think better books are out there. If you require this book for school, do get the soloution manual."
1,Not the same shoe anymore,"These shoes were once made in Europe and were fine shoes. They are now made in China and are not the same. The leather is much thinner and the shoes wear out in the heel very quickly inside. A lot of products are finely constructed in China, for example Apple Computer products. Clark needs to compare the quality of their former version of this shoe to the current version. It's all about supervising the manufacture, not the fault of the Chinese factory. I own a pair of the former version and the current. They don't feel quite the same to the foot either when wearing them."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have purchased two pairs of these shoes in the past and have worn them for many years. The shoes have been very comfortable and durable. In fact, I still have the last pair of shoes I purchased five years ago and they still look like new, despite showing moderate sole wear. With this purchase, I had only worn them for less than two hours and the both soles separated from the upper portion of the shoes and one of the soles split in half! The vendor graciously refunded the full purchase price without me having to incur any addtional cost of returning them...they accepted a picture of the shoes as proof of their post-wear condition."
5,GREAT SHOE!,"Very comfortable. My fifth pair. Have been wearing them since my internship, 35 years ago"
4,High Quality Shoe,"After wearing this pair, I am very satisfied with them. Very comfortable the very first day of wearing and standing up most of the day. Quality is very high. Only thing is the tongue is very thin and dosn't match the quality of the rest of the shoe."
3,OK Shoe,OK shoe but not as comfortable as other Clark models. Certainly well made but just not the right one for me.
5,quality is hard to find,today it is hard to find a shoe that will hold up for more than 6 - 8 mo. but this one --the last pare -- lasted me 3 + YEARS IT'S ALL IN THE SOLE and the quality.I bought 2 more pare -- the soles just last fore ever.Thanksslam
1,no good..,"I bought a 2nd pair after loving the 1st pair I bought about 5 years ago. This pair, although priced lower, fit nothing like the first. They were much narrower with a thinner sole. I noticed the 1st pair was made in Pakistan while the inferior 2nd pair in China. Buyer beware!"
5,The Most Comfortable Shoe on Earth!,"I've been wearing this exact shoe since 1990. This is my 4th pair. If I wear them every day they'll last just about 4 years. At one point I attempted a ""comfort upgrade"" and moved to a $400.00 Mephisto shoe. They weren't half as comfortable and the soles needed to be replaced after less than 2 years (at a cost of $85.00)."
2,This shoe no longer good quality - made in china - C R A P !,"The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years, however, the two new pairs (black and brown leather) were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe. The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks. The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China."
1,Clarks- made in China- came apart after 4 months,"Clarks Men's Natureveldt, purchased through Gabriel Shoes came apart after wearing them moderately for 4 month. Gabriel shoes did not provide any help just because the order passed 90 days policy.Awful product, awful service."
5,so much fun!,"I read this book as a child and now it's one of my son's favourites too, kids love opening all the letters!"
1,Wrong item,I ordered the book and audio tape but I got some letters and audio tape. I wanted to show my daughter. I try to contact to seller many times but no answer.
5,A Literary Treasure!,"This book is a ""must"" for anyone who appreciates the classic fairytales or ever grew up hearing them. It adds a new twist when the ""Jolly Postman"" delivers the letters to favorite fairytale characters.Every other page is an envelope with a letter inside. I bought this book for my niece and nephew's new baby in the hopes that he will love it as much as I do. I am an elementary school teacher who has read this book to my students for over 20 years. My students have loved this book so much that I've had to buy multiple copies and keep them under lock and key!"
5,Classic Kid's Book,I grew up with this book and it probably was the catalyst for my love affair of getting mail! A great book and fun for all.
5,Wait a minute Mr.Postman,We had this book in the school liabrary when I was in Elementry school. It was one of the few books that everybody ran for when we were allowed in the liabrary. It was a beloved book and enjoyed over and over again by many of us the 6 years we were there. I haven't read it in years though so I can't really give an accurate account of what it was about other than the postman delivering letters. But it was a wonderful book that will be enjoyed by generations to come.
4,Best book,"I love this book. It's wonderful. The only thing that I wasn't expecting was the book was much larger than I thought it would be. It is totally fine, but just a little bigger than expected."
5,Children love this book!,"Buy this fun, sweet book for your child or keep on hand to read to your grandchild. They will love to read it over and over and you will love to read it to them."
5,Jolly Postman--Every child should own this book!,"The Ahlbergs have surpassed every expectation in quality content, imagery and interactive concept for a child's book. If more authors would produce books like this, parents would be willing to spend more time with their children by reading to them instead of sticking kids in front of a telly or technical gadget for ""quality"" play time. Books like The Jolly Postman can reignite the parent/child love affair for pages that come to life with laughter. This book is in a league by itself, and both parents and children will quickly find this is one of their all-time favourite books long into adulthood. Buy it and be CHARMED over and over!"
5,Great Book for Children,"You'll love this cute little book, where each page has a different letter to or from a famous fictional character."
5,Wonderful for children and adults,"The Jolly Postman is not just a children's book, it's full of fun letters to read written by and sent to various fairytale characters we all know and love. The writing and posters are incredibly clever-- something adults will appreciate. Guaranteed to be a classic book for your family.And I HIGHLY suggest buying The Jolly Christmas Postman."
4,Had trouble with first one but new one works,Modifying my review because the seller awesomely saw my review that I had one that didn't work and sent me a replacement free of charge!Keep your eyes peeled though for a potential design flaw that the minute hand gets stuck on the second hand (the smaller circle toward the bottom of the review).
4,In the groove with the man,"A devout Neil fan and student for thirty years I'm convinced the reason for his success is because he keeps his music fresh for himself by changing directions. At times it seems he just needs to purge a type or gerne of music, but not on this CD. On ""Are You Passionate"" he hits a groove that might take the casual listener a spin or two to get. I've always loved the motown beat and Mr. Young has managed to meld his unique brand of guitar and lyrics with old Oater movie soundtracks, R&B beat and his falsetto. I think he pulls it off masterfully. But you need to give it a couple plays to really dig it. My four star rating is based on rating it to his vast body of work and where it falls, IMO. The more I listen to it the more I like it."
3,Neil Young Continues To Be Passionate About His Music,"Been listening to Neil Young for years which certainly says a bit about his longevity. If there is nothing else about him, it's that you never know what you're going to get - electric, hard rock, country, romantic, who knows.'Are You Passionate'falls into the humming, strumming, romantic, and, yes, sometimes fighting moods. It's not his best, but I can guarantee it's not his worst either. If you like Neil Young, you'll like this album; if you like Neil Young, you should buy it."
2,Where's the Passion?,"I am a major Neil Young fan, but aside from ""Two Old Friends"" I can't find much here I need to listen to again. This is probably the most boring Neil Young record ever made. There's a curious monotony to Young's vocals that comes off as a lack of passion. And the lyrics are generally ho-hum, or as everyone else here has pointed out, simplistically offensive (""Let's Roll""). I will buy and keep everything Young releases--I even still have my vinyl copy of his rockabilly monstrosity (""Everybody's Rockin'""). But I am glad I got the sublime Caitlin Cary solo debut ""while you weren't looking"" in the same shipment so I have something intelligent and passionate to listen to."
3,Just OK,"I have been a Neil Young lover my entire life. This CD is only OK. By that I mean that it's a little too mellow to be considered something great that I will pick up and listen to a lot. When I heard Neil's sample song from the CD, Going Home, I was excited to buy the CD thinking that most of it would be that way. It wasn't. Going Home is a great kicking song, but most of the rest of the CD is ""sleepy"". Neil, like Paul McCartney in the past, should definately keep his family members off of his CD's. I have heard bad reviews on the 9/11 Let's Roll song, because of it's lyrics, which I only half cared for, but there is something really eerie about that song that fits the cause. I would purchase any Neil Young CD, anytime, anywhere, because I love his voice which is different from anyone's that you'll ever hear. Buy it anyway, half is better than none and none is what you get in a great deal of the new music of today."
4,He's BAAAAAAAACK!!!,"Not a great Neil Young album by any fan's criteria - it's neither 'Ragged Glory' nor 'Harvest' - but certainly another thought provoking trip through that which makes us what we are.Why does this man have the ability to tap into our emotions on so many levels? Give a listen, several in fact, to 'Let's Roll'. A song about 9-11. Will it be bombast or bathos? Will it compare to 'Ohio'.After many score times - both on this CD and the costly CD single - I've come to believe this is every bit the supeiror to that song.Gone is the somewhat over-wrought emotion of 1970; replacing it is a deep soul searching self-analysis about who and what is humanity responsibility. You do what you have to do for the greater good. An older and wiser version of 'Ohio'; would that we all become that.More familiar themes abound: love lost and regained being the predominant one. There's also one more near epic. 'Going Home' takes metaphor and alliteration for a car ride from the Little Big Horm to Downtown."
2,I wish I didn't feel this way...,"I have been following along with Neil Young since he came down from Canada. He certainly remains one of the great artists and his early writing and recordings obviously bear that out... without question. As a result, I am VERY reluctant to offer this negative review. Having said those things... it is an OK record with OK songs... recorded with a GREAT group of players, all of whom have nothing but excellent resumes. (Hey, Booker T? Donald ""Duck"" Dunn? All these guys ARE music). The record has echos of STAX and some nice lyrical ideas and some nice hooks but the bottom-line for me is that it's just OK... not great. If it were not for the words Neil Young on the piece... it would be a stiff in two weeks."
2,Are You Passionate?....The answer is No on this one,"Neil should have asked himself that question before churning this one out. Neil has recorded with a lot of different people but Booker T and the MG's just isn't right. I give it two stars for the song ""Goin Home"" which is just truly incredible. And I think he did that one with Crazy Horse. IT's a blast straight off of the Zuma era. The rest of this CD is so incredibly lame."
3,Neil Goes Motown???,"It's always a [guess] with Neil & this one turns up as somewhat of a dud. Neil will never be accused of being afraid to try new things, but this experiment may have been best left undone. As a whole the disc is very soft. Sounds to me like Neil was shooting for a Motownish sound - ""Sugar Pie Honey Bunch"" sort of stuff. I admire his experimental ways but it doesn't mean I have to like the music all of the time. I wish there was a little more ""Cowgirl In The Sand"" and a little less Tempations here.For more of your classic Neil Young style in his recent releases grab ""Silver & Gold"" or ""Harvest Moon"" instead (but you probably knew that anyhow). I'm guessing another live release is next and then Neil will put out another ""back to his roots"" CD."
3,It's Okay But...,"This isn't a bad album but it's not Neil's best. Most of the songs are quite listenable but ""Let's Roll"" is a disappointment. It sure ain't ""Ohio."" Maybe it should have been stuck on the end of the album so it didn't interrupt the flow of the other songs. All in all, if you're a big Neil fan, you'll want this one. Otherwise, you are probably better off getting out your old copy of ""RAGGED GLORY"" and listening to it. Also recommended ""GUITARS, GIRLS & MOTELS."""
1,sometimes eclecticism is plain old self-indulgent!,"Hey, don't get me wrong; you'll not find a more ardent and dedicated Neil Young fan than yours truly. But for all his longstanding brilliance and outright genius Neil continues to confound with a real stinker thrown in every five years or so. To wit: Journey Through the Past, Landing on Water (Ugh), that mid eighties embarrassment ""Everybody's Rockin'"", Road Rock, and a few more memory's been kind enough to let me forget. ""...Passionate"" moves right to the top (or is it bottom) of this ignominious list. C'mon Neil, don't waste your (and our) time with this drivel. Finish up the long-awaited Archives ferGodssake!! Stay away from this awful CD"
2,Awful,"I was very excited to aquire Neil Young's newest CD; however, I was very disappointed in the CD. The song ""Let it roll"" was very good for the purpose it was written for, however, there was only one other song that was similar to his older style. I was very upset that the style of his music had changed."
2,"So sad....so, so sad....","This cd might (might, I said) deserve 3 stars, but I just can't get past what a terrible, terrible song ""Let's Roll"" is. The riff is ridiculously bad, the lyrics are totally pathetic, and I just can't believe Neil would jump on the patriotic bandwagon like that! This is coming from the same guy that wrote ""Southern Man"" & ""Keep on Rockin in the Free World""!?!? I'm in utter shock. ""Let's Roll"" aside, the cd is not all that bad. Neil is going in a new direction with this soul stuff, and it's definitely not as good as his old rock or acoustic stuff, but he can pull it off fairly well..."
2,"Nice try, but Neil can't write albums anymore.","This is not a very good album from one of the best songwriters, Neil Young. I hardly consider this or his last album, Silver and Gold, to be ""comeback"" albums. Neil Young decided to go soul now, and it just doesn't fit him. However, ther are more rock songs on this album than the last one, but that's not saying much. Horn sections and female backing vocals never really suited his kind of playing. However, there are a few good tunes. ""Going Home"" is another great jam with Crazy Horse that harkens back to Rust Never Sleeps. She's A Healer is a decent song, and Let's Roll is actually quite good for a 9/11 song. (I'm getting REALLY tired of those songs however). But the album is filled with dull or just bad songs. Hopefully, Greendale should be better, what with Neil playing with Crazy Horse again."
1,"To quote Neil, its ""a piece of ...","Neil Young has always, for me, been one of the most intelligent and serious musicians around. He has always attacked themes with integrity and robustness. When I heard the first song on the album, the postcard to his daughter I thought that this album was going to be a winner... And, yes, there are a few songs that stand up on there own. But together, the album is weak and light-weight. I'm sorry I bought it!The other day I had four new CD's by old rockers in my car - Mellencamp, U2, James and Neil - and I am sorry to say that Neil comes a very distant fourth."
3,About Let's Roll...,"This album is ok, some of the songs are good, some aren't but what I really want to say is, will everyone please stop slagging Neil for writing ""Let's Roll""? Admittedly it's not a very good song, but everyone who is calling it right-wing, jingoistic, and hypocritical (or anyone who is saying, haha, even lefty Neil Young supports this war)is just plain WRONG. People are completely taking the song out of context. It's about the passengers on Flight 93 fighting the [enermy], and it is a tribute to them and their courage. The song is not about America's current foreign policy. The song is not about America's strikes on Afghanistan or the War on Terrorism in general. So everyone stop trying to make [a] song mean something it doesn't. Thank you."
3,"I wanted to like it, but...","I'm all for Neil Young going on these kinds of adventures, but he fails to keep this off the ground. I guess his old vocal coaxers aren't around, and he sings sharp on more than one song. As always, there are some interesting songs, particularly the title cut. And the guitar playing is interesting in spots. But this sort of laid back Al Green style requires a little more oomph from the singer, and Young doesn't supply it. And these guilt ridden love songs need some darker hues to be really interesting."
3,Neil means passionate,I just found out while looking at baby names that the name Neil means passionate. This makes the album name so much cooler. That said its no On the Beach or Rust but Neil continues to keep me interested in what's coming next.
4,"Not great, but some keepers","Not among his best as a total work, but a couple of cuts are keepers for burning onto a ""Neil Young favorites"" CD : ""Definitely"", ""Are You Passionate"", and ""Going Home"". His voice detracts from a couple of the cuts, but guitars are strong throughout. It grows on you ... still on on the car CD player after 3 weeks."
3,hello mr. soul,"At first, I was concerned about the Booker T backing...having seen Booker and his team look a little lost with Neil's sloppiness from a Warfield show way back. But they're both in fine form here, with 'She's a Healer' the obvious standout.I was also concerned that Neil had hung up the electric for good (see Silver & Gold)...but he even manages to bring out the Horse, which is always a good sign.I had high hopes for 'Let's Roll', but it truly blows. When he needed to let out his rock n' roll fury a la 'Blue Heaven' he holds back and it just piddles along. But that is one misstep in a pretty solid late-career offering from Neil, and I'm always psyched to get a new one from the man.Now when is he going to release the box set?"
5,Neil Young does it again - A true evergreen artist,"Neil Young has turned in another spectacular performance! Fans will appreciate the way he reinvents himself, regularly revealing new facets of his sensitive and complex persona - always reflected in great lyrics, excellent band backup and beautiful singing.This is a wonderful collection of songs of the heart and of emotion. Enjoy !"
4,"Solid, Guitar-driven Neil","Personally I like it when an aged rocker revisits a period of his career and updates it with wisdom. Bowie has done it a few times and taken some critical lumps for it. But in my opinion he, Van Morrison, and Neil on this new album, keep it fresh. ""Are You Passionate"" seems to recall Buffalo Springfield with its Motown-tinged hooks. Nearly all the songs have a signature guitar riff that, like Mick Ronson's contributions to early seventies Bowie songs, is often more memorable than the vocal melody. But this isn't the kind of stuff one should dissect; Neil pulls it off with his usual ease and the performances are masterful, yet seem to come from someone's garage. We need to appreciate how hard this would be for anyone else who has recorded as much music as Neil. Cherish this guy while you've got him; and keep buying the new stuff!"
3,Well .....,"Is Neil Young Passionate? The title suggested a riled up album, but instead listeners are mostly treated to a sound that resembles Neil Young - MoTown. The first four tracks all lumber along with bouncing basslines and somber falsettos. The track that elicits the most passion from the man is ""Let's Roll"", a tribute to the passengers of Flight 93. Young sings the song as if he really means it, and the band moves superbly behind him. The title track has its soft moments, but ""Goin Home"", which features Crazy Horse, rocks like no other song on the album. The remainder of the tunes drift along pleasantly - ""When I Hold You In My Arms"" has all the charm of 'Harvest Moon', and ""Two Old Friends"" tells the touching story of a preacher and God. The MoTown sound that listeners will find on a majority of the tracks - and that is the sound - doesn't fit Young all that well, but for some the ups will make up for the downs."
2,are you on tranquilizers?,"I have been a giant Neil young for over 3 decades.Neil's willingness to experiment is well known but this match up does not work very well.Poor Neil is totally out of his element with the slick polished stuff Booker turns out.Neil's charm has always been ""planned diharmony"".Bookers stuff takes the teeth out of the tiger.The album bored me to tears with the exception of ""going home"".Ah well just another one of Neil's famous detours.I sure hope that Neil comes back with some Crazy Horse stuff real soon."
1,Don't Waste Your Money Or Time On This DVD,"Be advised, this is not the ARS we all know and love. ARS without Ronnie Hammonds is not ARS. This is like watching a cover band. Don't waste your money or your time with this DVD."
3,decent product,"I bought these vent shades for my 2004 Sunfire, and they seem to be of a decent quality and look sharp. However the design does not allow you to keep your window open much at all, they simply don't hang down low enough to prevent a mildly windy rainstorm from blowing in."
1,Backwards Item,"I recieved ths item in a timely manner, however it could not be worn because the belt loop and the tin on the bace was backwards. if i wore it the the way it was made the flag and name of Guyana would be upside bown. when i sent an e-mail to the company there was no responce from them. i called and lefa a message and still no resposefrom them."
2,"Cute, but short","I bought this because everyone in my family is a Spongebob fanatic, and I thought it would be good to buy something Stephen Hillenburg himself created.I'm not all that pleased with the book - it's very short, and there are no new Spongebob-isms, they are all taken from the episodes. If you are like us, you want NEW Spongebob materials."
1,drains your bank account.. not just the battery,I had to replace the battery overnight.... I wouldn't recommend and I'm taking it back to the store tomorrow
3,PetSafe Small Dog Receiver -- Is this really what you want?,"I have two Chihuahua Mixes -- 6lbs and 11 lbs -- that I am using this collar on. The whole undergound fence idea is great -- don't get me wrong -- I've used it for years on my larger dogs when I had them. But for small dogs, don't expect these recievers to be perfect. First of all, they look gigantic on my two small dogs. Second, smaller dogs (as small dog owners know) are much more sensitive and the prongs are really uncomfortable for them once you get them as snug as they need to be without the whole collar sliping over their little tiny heads. And, finally, battery life is a real problem; turn them off when you can to help conserve. In hindsight, I would just get the smallest normal dog size of receiver and attach it to a regular collar using the shortest probes."
1,I wish the battery would last a month- mine lasts a week!,I look with envy at the folks who purchased this unit and were able to get a whole month out of a battery. My batteries only last a week. I have tried everything to prolong battery life. I turned the unit off. I took the battery out and stored it separately. Still I got a week (max) out of a battery. I even tried adapting the battery holder to use the lower cost (non-petsafe) batteries- but the hassle involved with using this collar are so significant that I am just sick of it. I would welcome any advice on other collars that work with this unit- but have longer life batteries. Right now the unit is worthless.
2,Isn't working for my dog,"We bought this collar at a local pet store and it worked at first. But now it doesn't really phase him. He doesn't like to wear the collar so just showing it to him is effective 25% of the time. But if he is already worked up by someone in the house or knocking at the door, forget it! I will continue to try and find a way to train my little dog to stop the barking. He is a Maltese and the high pitched yap that comes out of his little body is enough to make a person jump off a bridge. By the way, the other comments are correct. The battery life is extremely short on this collar."
1,Unreliable Collar.,I have two collars. The Big one for my lab works ten times better. The little one doesnt react anywhere near as quick as the big one. Plus its ten times more expensive. Since the battery is Twelve bucks a month plus shipping. Since they rigged it to constantly drain the battery so they make a ton of money on the batteries.
1,Be informed!!,"The only way to keep this collar from eating up batteries is to literally turn it off when the dog is not outside. It has an on/off switch where you insert a coin to rotate it to the off position. They don't make this clear enough regarding battery, if they had I wouldn't have bought it. I got it because of the levels of correction. I already had collars and their batteries lasted up to 12 months but one dog needed something a little stronger."
4,Good Product - not always easy to train (re-train in my case) the dog,"This is a nice small version of the product. I love the invisble fence that we have, but I re-did my yard so I had to run a new fence wire and it changed the location of where the dogs could go. The 'retraining' of them to the new border has been challenging. I ended up returning this and getting the stubborn dog version.This one worked fine, but my one dog still did not pay attention to it. So, give it a try, this is certainly the cheaper location to purchase the product from. It was significantly more expensive in the local retail stores."
1,Buyer be aware of the hidden costs!!,As with all the other reviews (which I wish I had read BEFORE I bought this money pit) the unit is a battery draining hog. It does not work as well as the larger collars either. Due to the units smaller size our dog has to be right up on the wire to get a warning unlike the larger unit which can give anywhere from 3-10 ft of warning. I wish I would never had purchased this thing....Petsafe needs to make some major changes to make this item worth the money they are charging.
1,The Most Expensive Collar You Will Ever Buy,"The collar has a great design and worked great on our small dog for about a month; however, the company placed a flashing light on the model which eats the battery in about a month. The replacement batteries are specially made by the company to fit the collar and run about $10.00. Therefore, once you buy the collar to keep the collar operating for your dog you are looking at spending about $120 a year. The company has a slightly larger collar that does not have the flashing light that we use on our other small dog. Those batteries are also specially made by the company, but the battery lasts quite some time (over a year). Although our other dog is bright and once he got popped a time or two does not come near the boundaries. I wish I would have never bought this product."
1,Poor Design - Greedy Business Model,"We have 2 small dogs and tried these collars. We were shocked to find that the batteries would only last 3-4 weeks and cost $10 each. With 2 dogs, that is over $240 a year in batteries. This week one of the collars broke and I called their customer service line. To send a replacement collar for warranty repair would cost me an $18 non refundable deposit. I gave them the choice of losing a customer or charging me $18. They chose to lose a customer. Think twice before buying these collars...."
5,Two Tips (Batteries and Flags),"We love this collar. We already had the in-ground fence for our bigger dog, and we bought this to add our new little dog. It worked perfectly. I highly recommend it. Here are two tips to make the most of this collar.Batteries:The battery plugs don't last as long as the one in the big collars, and cost $8 or more to replace. The good news is that you can re-use the plug and just replace the battery inside for $1.50. Here is a video I made, showing how to replace the battery: [...]Flags:Pet-Safe provides little flags to show your dog the boundry. They are ok, but your dog must learn that they can't go between the flags either. Instead of flags, we used a rope. This made is really easy for our dog to know the boundry. She had it down within a week."
5,Exactly what the doctor ordered.,"This handy piece of equipment is pretty straight forward in its use. I needed something to act as both an adapter, as well as a roundabout coupler between two cables. My video card only has a DVI-out and I wanted to use my computer as a media center on my television, which has HDMI ports on it. Ultimately, this did the trick without issue. Seems fairly well made for something so simple."
1,Did not receive what was shown,"Purchased this converter to be able to hook a DVI connector to a DVI to VGA connector. In the picture shown, the DVI side has all the pin sockets. However, the one that I received has less, to be more specific, the connector shown is a DVI-I dual link but what I received was a DVI-D dual link. Therefore, I cannot use it because it will not fit into the cable it is supposed to plug into."
5,"Belkin Serial Extension Cable (10 Feet, DB9M to DB9F)",It was received in good condition and works just as expected. It's a cable and it works I don't know what else to say.
2,Not worth the price!,Thought the game would be a lot more fun; but actually my guests did not find it very entertaining....we threw out some of the cards including the picture of someone shooting people in a movie theatre; I'm all for humor and sarcasm...this was crossing the line. Would not recommend as a purchase.
1,Not an enjoyable game!,"Four experienced adult board game players played this game several times over one long weekend. We all found it's rules overly complex and hard to follow. We quit the game about half way through being totally frustrated! Like others have commented modifying the rules as you go might fine tune to your liking. This game was NOT fun to play. I can also imagine that with a limited number of cartoon cards to play and replay it might get to be predictable real soon.My solution was to return the game for a refund and move on!To add insult to injury I am a long time subscriber to The New Yorker and love the back page cartoons, sometimes even making a submission."
2,"Bargain basement price, Bargain basement quality","I got a got fair price through an online computer outlet, but when the bearings went bad within just 2 months and I set out to obtain some warranty service, neither the online computer outlet nor the manufacturer would return a voice mail message, nor respond to their online customer request forms. I've left multiple messages with manufacturer. I began the process Dec. 27th & today is Jan. 5th without a single word from seller or manufacturer. Please be aware of who you deal with or buy from online. Cheapest is not always in your favor. It seems customer service is given up for the good price. Also, this item is sold under multiple manufactur's names. The model number, IDVD16DDME is identical. One business doing trade with multiple names? Makes one think a bit...."
3,A little bit ghetto,"Although this cd/dvd burner/player was recommended to me by the person in charge of tech support for my job, i feel that it is slightly ghetto...it is large, bulky, and takes up too much space on my desk...also, the logo sticker on the top of it looks like it was never fully attached, so it's all curled up at the edges and comes off easily, thus making the ghetto look of it more complete...it gets the job done all right, but it's just way too big and cumbersome to be an up-to-date external driver for my computer..."
3,Someone needs a good kick in the bum,"Aragon has absolutly, positively, deffinitly NOTHING TO DO WITH HARRY POTTER!!!!!! LORD OF THE RINGS YOU NINNY! Nincompoop! Where have you been for the last ten years!? Between movies and Books etc.!! Whoever wrote that dicription needs a good kick in the bum. However the costume is good so I can't fault that. Kids should get hours of enjoyment out of it. Lots of fun. Yours sincerly, Pedantic Pat :-)"
3,cheap,The costume was SUCH cheap fabric and the belt was laughable. I would recommend getting brown fabric and making your own cape and getting a belt from DI or Salvation Army. The boot covers were satisfactory after I sewed on extra elastic pieces to really hold them over his shoes and the tunic was okay.
4,Good stuff,This workout will leave you dripping in sweat. And is a very good workout for a more laid back individual that just wants to stay fit. The problems i had with this dvd was i wish there was more of a warm up in the beginning instead of a pilates like ab routine. I also dont recommend people who have shoulder problems to push your self to the limit. just adjust to you limits without injurying urself more.
3,"Name it Workout, not Yoga","I've got this DVD as Yoga newbie 2 months ago.Agree with Carrie and the 1-star review - while this is a nice concept, I feel the fact to get-out-of-breath has little to do with yoga. I used this program several times now, and the more I go into Yoga practice, the less I like it.+ trainer keeps me motivated, real ""fitness-studio"" feeling-- ""Cardio""-sections are way too fast, it's impossible to keep correct breathing- modified versions are presented by only 1 person (out of 6-7 participants), and camera shows this person only occasionally; not really helpful for beginner.I would not recommend this DVD for yoga practice, but for those who want to get nice workout with yoga elements."
3,Not bad,"I have several different yoga and other work out DVD's and was looking for something new that was less than an hour long for days I don't have much time. This workout flew by. There was not a lot of time to hold any poses, so you felt rushed through the whole thing. On a positive note, you do sweat and at the end feel like you did a cardio work out. Overall, I will probably add this to my rotation of dvd's but not consider it my favorite."
5,cute,This is a good size keychain especially for the price. It was bought for a gift for my grandmother who loves Tweety and it was perfect
3,This book is ok but imperfect,"I got this book looking for some occasional inspiration on self acceptance. While there's some value in the essays, quite a bit of the text is rather inane. A fairly substantial portion of the essays are geared toward women, a fact not mentioned on the cover of the introduction. On the other hand, the photos are really quite interesting.Retail selling price is a bit high for a 96-page book.Still, it's perfectly acceptable as a coffee table book and worth purchasing if you can get it at a discount."
3,The Art of Imperfection,"I was disappointed in this book after seeing the author on TV. Her message was not as clear in the book as on her TV appearance. I liked the sepia look of the book, but there was a lack of real content."
3,Just ok for me,"After reading Strenght in Numbers I have to say I was rather bored. I continued reading just for the sake of reading it and getting to the end. The sex scenes were just ok for me and the story line was lacking. I ended up not really caring about David and what happened to him. Half way throught the story I just felt like slapping him to get some sense into him!Brandy's story in ""Branded"" was a bit better in my opinion. I liked the fact that it was M/F/F this time around as most of what I have been reading lately has been M/M/F so it was a nice change of pace. The whole BDSM thing isn't really my cup of tea. I just can't fathom calling anyone master or mistress and what's associated with it. But, I did find the story line interesting and the characters sexy."
5,Hot and Fabulous,"I greatly enjoyed ""Double Jeopardy"" because of the soul links between Kendall, Sutter, and Josh. ""Strength"" doesn't have that aspect but it does has completely rounded out characters and hot relationships.David finally comes to grips with his own sexuality but puts Joy and Jason through some very difficult times before becoming honest with himself.Brandy's story is a lot more complex and I'm not sure I was comfortable with the rougher side of the story, i.e. Dominants and Submissives and the what had to be very painful BDSM.But this book is a fabulous read and an absolute keeper."
4,A tough education,"This book, while having some similarity to Enders Game (Orson Scott Card), is an introduction to a series that has very few pleasant characters. Everyone is in it for their own gain, but at least Rissa and Bran are fighting on the 'good' side. In this book and Young Rissa, you learn why they are the hard bitten people rebelling against the federation. Well fleshed out characters and strong storyline make this a compelling read."
5,Flat bed wrecker,This product seems to be working well on my flatbed wrecker rails. At first I thought is might be a little thin. I'm not sure exactly how it works but it has good adhesion properties and my bed is sliding well.
4,"Hook, Line, and Sinker","I'm a rookie when it comes to Black Tape For A Blue Girl, I honestly forget how I found out about them but, when I listened to them, I was amazed. The voice and instruments combine and make it one awesome listening experience. I have shared ""The Scavenger Bride"" with a lot of my friends and they all have enjoyed listening to it and of course, I have as well. I do recommend this CD to anyone who loves people who can actually sing."
4,The bride I'd be glad to take.,"Black Tape for a Blue girl is brilliant. I found them quite by accident and I'm glad I did. Not only is the music incredible, but the lyrics are brilliant and soulful. Now a days 'music' from groups that lack any kind of merit whatsoever are so common, it's hard to even get excited about a new release or a new single on the radio.This simply does not apply to Black Tape for a Blue Girl. Their lyrics say something, their music is thought out and masterfully put together. I recommend very highly."
2,Bad Vocals/Lyrics and Barely Passable Arrangement,"This cd is not worth the purchase. If you are a diehard BTFBG fan then stop reading now - you're gonna buy the cd anyway.If you are interested in BTFBG and looking for an a good example then don't buy this cd. This cd has horrible lyrics and a bad impersonation of Peter Murphy. Buy Ashes in Brittle Air, Before the Buildings Fell or even First Pain to Linger - but don't get this cd. It isn't worth your money.The sound is a bit mundane and badly mixed - sometimes the vocals are too loud and too strong to even hear the music, and if you do hear the music it is repetitive and banal.The two stars come from the overall feel of the album. It isn't nearly as bad as it could be but it does not measure up to the standard they have set.Caveat Emptor."
3,DEAD CAN DANCE?,"NEVER IN A MLLION YEARS SHOULD BTFBG EVER, I SAY AGAIN, EVER BE LIKENED TO DCD. THEIR SOUNDS ARE A UNIVERSE APART.I love BTFBG. BUT... this album sounds just like... well.... BTFBG. Of course those HORRIBLE male vocals of the past are thankfully gone. But in the end THIS SOUNDS JUST LIKE EVEYTHING ELSE ""THEY'VE"" DONE since The Rope.I've been a big fan since I first discovered BTFBG in the early 90's and have faithfully purchased each new release. I am absolutely STUNNED at how many reviews I've read, many included in the Projekt newsletter, that suggest comparisons to DCD. I'm actually surprised Sam Rosenthal has never mentioned this GLARING DISCREPANCY in his newsletter.As mentioned I am indeed a fan, but I only give this CD 3 stars since it's basically a re-hash of the same old thing they've been doing for years over and over again. Personally I'd really prefer to see some growth in the group."
4,If all marriges were as beautiful.,"Brilliant, simply brilliant. Black Tape for a Blue girl has done it again with deep, thoughtful lyrics set to masterfully composed music. I can't say more than listen to it for yourself, I'm sure you'll feel the same."
1,Junior Samples,"1) Buy a sampler keyboard 2)learn at least 3 notes 3)have credit card with big limit 4) hire musicians who are willing to improvise over your musical garbage for CASH 5) read the introductory guide to Kafka or take Theatre History 101 6)spend money on recording an album over your assorted 3 note doodles 7)buy expensive ads in Alternative Press and assorted goth magazines 8)make endless compilations featuring endless assortments of endless mixes of endless tracks, especially if it has your own band on it 9) hype your band like it's the NEXT BIG THING on your website, and then make everyone believe you've signed Siouxsie and the Banshees by drawing a bad outline of Siouxsie with a big question mark through it 10)don't let anyone see your bad reviews 11) believe all your good reviews."
1,What Concept?,"I first heard of ""The Scavenger Bride"" from a story I read on the Internet by Linda Joy Singleton, which was way before I heard of this album. Linda, I hope you know about this.Anyway, this ""concept album"" comprises a flurry of 3 note doodles and nonesuch which might be catagorized as ""goth"" or ""new age goth"" or ""zzzzzzzz"" or whatever. There's not much to it, unless you are a college freshman and enjoy smatters of Kafka or DuChamp and consider yourself an artist because of it.Anyway, I would like to know what Klaus Kinski or Sonic Youth or Bastille Day has to do with Prague, 1913. I'm a student a history, and would love the challenge. This, I'm afraid, is not very good for the student of music (of the present OR of the 20th century). Please let me know because I am thirsting for an answer!"
1,I couldnt even watch half of it,This movie was a waist of my money. How is a gospel movie going to have that much strong sex and strong cursing. This is for sure not for kids. I was really disappointed. It almost made me mad. It could have been the same movie and point with out the cursing and sexual content that it had. It is for sure not for young people and new christian. As a child of God I believe in holiness. There is alot of point I can disagree with in this movie and Im sorry I ever got it.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"My 7 year old received this as a Birthday gift. How DISAPPOINTED she was to get this from her best friend. The matt slides, the music is dumb and does not play in time with the lights. Even on beginner mode, the lights move too fast! My 2 yr old wanted to give it a try, and summed it up by saying, ""this game is BORING!!!"". Don't waste your money!!!"
1,Awful music,"My 5.5 year old son got this as a present and we were horrified by how horrible all the pre-programmed music choices were. Also, the lights which teach the steps don't go to the beat of the music and the beginner mode seemed too hard for our 5-year-old. Seems worthwhile to spend more for a higher quality version of this toy!"
4,Scrubbettes review,"These great little square sponges -- with a rough scouring edge -- are the best pads I have ever used on pots and pans, as well as other items in my home: bathtubs, toilets and more. I always like to have plenty around for both the bathrooms and the kitchen. They hold up remarkably well -- considering how often I use them.Glad to find these online because our local supermarkets have discontinued carrying them. The price online was decent too. Thanks!One suggestion: In your description about this product, you should have told the actual size in inches for these scouring pads."
4,from child to child,"A thoroughly engaging book written by a child and her grandpa for other children. This book is perfect to be read by parents to their children. The (important) lessons of tolerance and trust, wisdom and knowledge, can be focused on or not. The story is delightful (that is, full of delight), and is built on an authentic child's point of view. The references to other stories adds to the charm."
2,Too Drawn-Out,"For whatever reason, I vividly remember watching this FTT episode as a child. Unfortunately, watching it as an adult (with a younger sibling) did not live up to the billing.The first half of the episode is so drawn out to be boring, while the second half is filled with cheesy dialogue and weird (often disturbing, for young children) special effects.The main guest stars in this one are Jeff Bridges, Shelley Duvall, and Gina Rowlands.Skip this installment and move along to better ones that indeed exists."
5,Best deal out there,"We purchased this TV for use at trade shows. Excellent portability, nice bright picture, and unlike a lot of other TV's in this size, decent sound. Purchased a cheap 26 inch wheeled suitcase and some foam padding to use as a transport and storage case. Works great!"
3,A different take,"While the historical value of this book is undeniable for it's descriptions of an Africa that is no more, I found the book to drag a bit as far as reading enjoyment. I would say that there are far more engaging books for the casual reader of hunting, exploration and adventure books. Much of the text is devoted to somewhat redundant descriptions of travel, setting up camp, suffering from fever and shooting whatever game animals happened to be at hand in order to keep his porters in meat. The tales of his pursuit of and engagements with elephants which are scattered through the book are much more engaging than the rest. If you're assembling a collection, by all means include this title but I wouldn't start here if you're looking for exciting reading."
1,Not received,I have not yet received this order.Please find order or credit my account.The order was placed nearly two months ago.
2,"Close, but no cigar","I like Michael Palin, but this DVD is NOT funny. I couldn't get past 10 minutes of the first disc and I was too bored to continue. I may try to watch it again sometime in the future, but I hate to waste so much time."
5,And now for something completely different,This is completely different from Monty Python. Two of the MP veterans have written a series of half hour programs in the vein of classical British boy's adventure stories. The cast are drama actors who do not ham it up or exaggerate their characters (except for the two MP veterans).What makes the stories funny is the twists that are thrown in at frequent intervals. You have to have an intimate knowledge of British culture and social institutions prior to 1930 to spot these twists and appreciate them. You will smile and mildly chuckle instead of rolling on the floor laughing as you did for Monty Python.In some ways these remind me of the early Carry On movies with their low key humor.
4,Pythonesqe fun,"Ripping Yarns is a fine collection of very funny stories from Michael Palin and Terry Jones. This is not the sort of floating consciousness sketch writing that was so prevalent in the Monty Python days, but we did see some hints of this type of whole show sketch writing with the Python episode ""The Cycling Tour"" where the entire episode had a central theme if not to say plot.I personally wish there had been a bit more Terry Jones in front of the camera instead of always behind it. Palin is a very gifted comic actor with a great range of character types.These shows are not the same caliber or quality as ""Monty Pythons Flying Circus"". They certainly aren't in the same league as Cleese's ""Fawlty Towers"" but they are very funny and quite worth having in your home library of British comedy."
2,Coil's era of noise,"Having been a fan of Coil's since '87 I bought this album. Coil have moved into the noise/ambient direction where a lot of their later work can only been taken in small doses. This album is good for laying back and relaxing to drone-type music, but if a trance-type state is what you're looking for, Current 93's ""Crystal"" is much better."
4,Original Equipment Replacements,These pads work just fine as replacements for the original pads on older bikes. I like the Dia Comp 76 Grey Matter Pads a little better even though they cost a little more.
3,"Beautiful pictures and storyline, but not a repeat storybook","I judge a child's storybook by how often my son grabs it off the book shelf at storytime. However, this story is never chosen by my son and is only read at storytime when I chose it. Grandfathers Journey has beautiful pictures and a storyline that will hit the heart of any adult who has moved from one area to another"
4,One of the Best Children&#65533;s Book Ever,"Grandfathers Journey is an awesome kids book. I gave it four stars because it was very good and unlike most children's books it was not very predictable. The book had extremely good pictures in it. It was a very god choice for a Caldecott award. The book was good for people from ages 3 - 83. Even the little history in it was accurate. All in all, the book was surprisingly good."
5,It was a wonderful book!!,"Allen Say's grandfather always wanted to explore the world. He went to America! He saw many cities, deserts, and he loved it all! But he missed his home in Japan...Allen Say wrote this wonderful story called ""Grandfather's Journey"". This story reminds all of us about the love for our country. And no matter how much you love California, New York, Europe, or Asia..you can never forget your homeland!"
5,Loved it in Kindergarten,"I went to a magnet school K-3rd grade and this was the focus of one our literary classes when I was in Kindergarten in 1993-1994. I absolutely LOVED this book. Our teacher dressed up in a kimono (different name when a male wears it I think?) and read the story like he was actually from Japan it was amazing. The fact that I still remember it today made me decide that I would use it in my 1st grade class at the magnet school I teach at now. Excellent, excellent book."
2,Award winner,"I read Grandfather's Journey. This book was a caldecott winner. The reason that I think it was a Caldecott winner was because it had very good pictures. The books are for younger kids, so the pictures help with keeping their attention on the book. The book is also very predictable, so younger people can understand it better. There was a conflict in the book. The grandfather could not decide whether to go to California or to stay at his home in Japan. This book is a good book, and you should read it too."
4,pretty good boots,"nice looking, durable, but uncomfortable if you wear them all day. also they are steel toed so they're heavy as well."
2,well i guess you get what you pay for,"i bought this for threading 1/2 rigid conduit only, and after threading 10 threads, the teeth got worn, i assume you can get new teeth for it but who wants to replace them after 10 threads? i haven't tried the other sizes but i'm sure there the same, spend the money and get a rigid set"
5,YOUNG JOHN WAYNE CLASSIC WESTERN MOVIES,"LAWLESS FRONTIER - John Wayne Stars in this action adventure set in the early untamed west where men lived by the quickness of the draw. Wayne delivers a tremendous performance as our hero who fights and dishes out his own dose of law and order.LUCKY TEXAN - John Wayne and his sidekick ""Gabby"" Hayes play act as gold miners who strike it rich. Unfortunately, before they can enjoy the fruits of their labor, they are wrongfully accused of robery and murder. As always, the road to the truth is never a straight path."
4,Good creepy fun..........,"What an excellent collection of short stories! A little something for everyone. I found ""Not My Son"" by Ruth McCarty to be particularly chilling - every parent's nightmare. ""Totaled"" by Clayton Emery is an unnerving story and Skye Alexander's ""Life, Death, Love and Baseball"" has humor and the metaphysical mystique of her novel ""Hidden Agenda"". This is a great book for a cold night when you have a hot cup of tea and are absolutely certain you have nothing to fear.........."
5,"Old Commandments, New Wine","Joy Davidman was a communist and an atheist before she met God - or, God met her. In this book, she comments upon the ten commandments as they stood out for a 20th Century, American Jew believing in Jesus as the Messiah. The foreword by C. S. Lewis, whom she married later, probably enhances the interest for this book, as does the book and movie Shadowlands (on their life together). But once opened, it needs no further help. Her outlook is sharp and perceptive. The examples are, admittedly, not as up to date as they were fifty years ago, but nor are they dated. The gist of the book is that the commandments are relevant and good in modern life, and that holds true still."
4,Grandmother's Treasures,"This cookbook is similar to one my grandmother had. I had received this book after her passing but through lending it out it was misplaced. The cover on her cookbook was red, which I would like to locate this book as well!! I am happy with the book I received!"
3,"Not so bad, kinda trite","This has been done and done better by Evangelion (a series I hated). Sekais was correct in his assessment of this anime. While the characterization was more personable than Evangelion, that's about the only good thing. Evangelion conveyed more urgency, panic and passion than Rah Xephon, and did it better.The orbital ""Angel"" was a pretty obvious rip-off. While imitation is supposedly the sincerest form of flattery, it doesn't make the imitator stand out. I think people like that Rah Xephon resolves better and more neatly than Evangelion, however I don't find it to be a better storyteller though.It was a decent enough anime, but it's not an epic. You won't find much intensity and the ending of the series is really rather abrupt and quite a let down after the build up from the rest of the series."
1,"Crap, wrong item","Rahxephon - Complete Collection (Purchased on September 4, 2012)Thats what i ordered and instead i received RAHXEPHON - ORKHESTRATION 7: CRESCENDO.The item i received was 1 disc and contained 3 episodes.I have looked at the order i placed and it says i paid for this item: Rahxephon - Complete Collection (Purchased on September 4, 2012)by Jason DouglasThe shipping was suppose to be faster than when i received it.I found it very dissapointing that the DVD collection i paid for and waited since September 4 (as seen above) arrives and instead of it having 8 disc's i got a DVD cover with 1 disc that contained the last 3 episodes when its suppose to include 23 or 24 episodes.As i still want this DVD collection Rahxephon - Complete Collection what do i do with it. As this isnt the product i ordered what is the best option for me to do? Send it back and get the whole collection sent to me. Or wait for the rest of the collection?Thanks for your helpBenjamin P Cruden"
2,Waste of time,"Its not that the art is bad, or the action is dull, it's simply a matter of poor plot developement. There's no manga to go with it either, and that's already a sign pointing towards a chaotic plot line. It's almost like it was being written while still in production. It's also surprisingly emo and makes too many failing attempts at being philosophical n such (a common anime thing, but most at least have a foundation to which the idea is represented). So, this isn't an anime I'll watch again when I can just go see the very anime it copied off of, but is well worth the time and money, Evangelion."
5,The Body Betrayed,"The Body Betrayed is an outstanding book! Kathryn J. Zerbe writes with much knowledge and compassion about the many complicated aspects of the different disorders, and devotes a lot of time to the discussion of dually-diagnosed patients. She gives careful analysis to the varied influences that effect the onset of these illnesses, and shares some of the real life experiences from her treatment facility. This is a very detailed, but readable book for patients, family, friends, clinicians, and anyone wanting to know more about eating disorders."
5,An Acquired Taste,"As my title states, Orphen season 2 is an acquired taste. If you've seen season one you will notice a HUGE difference in animation and plot (story surfaces only in the second DVD). However, Orphen season 2 is remarkably good. The humor is actually funny and considering the dark feel of season one it's a refreshing change. In this DVD you'll see Magic dress as a woman (complete with demeanor and softened voice). There is also a Titanic pseudo-parody: a sinking ship, lowered lifeboats and a captain that looks like he was on the James Cameron film. Don't expect a sappy love story because Cleo does something to Orphen that's not nice: funny but not nice. The dialogue is far more entertaining in English than in Japanese (Like when Volken tells Orphen :""The 80's called, they want their cloths back"") The main story is an interesting one although not much is divulged. Get it for the humor, if nothing else."
2,not one of my favorites,"Explosions in the sky are still better than 95% of the music that's out there but I was rather disappointed by this album after falling in love with their last one.Unfortunately, none of the tunes were very memorable. I found the second cd (with remixes of the songs by artists like jesu and four tet among others) more engaging.They're still a band with vast potential and I'm still waiting for their next release but I just wasn't pleased with this one."
3,Uh yeah...about AoaSIME,"It's ok, but where are the sweeping melodies? There's no ""Your Hand in Mine"" or ""The Only Moment We were Alone"" on this album. Not bad, but not a must-buy either. Frankly, i've been listening to more of Yndi Halda's new album."
3,"Decent, But Not Their Best","Explosions in the Sky have made a well known presence on experimental/progressive music listeners; problem is new comers might think this is their standard musically speaking.The album overall isn't disappointing, just lacks the creativity of EIT's past albums. Seize this one last if you are really into them. Tryout EIT's album ""The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place"", this is a much better start to their wonders."
2,OUCH!!!,"Why do so many of this bands songs become a frenzied barage of cymbal smashing! Your trying to sit back and relax with the music..and wham! Time and time again you are assaulted ! No Thanks, better music out there."
5,Epic.,"I was terribly surprised to see this album not rated an overall 5 stars, and was thus compelled to add a review. The top reviewers actually cover it quite well except for saying anything to the like of it being the same as their other work. This album ranges from haunting to enlivening, and to hear it live is cathartic. I don't care what kind of music you listen to, Explosions will take your breath away if you take the time to sit and listen. Their music leaves me the the drive to do little else but listen."
1,I own this book and I don't like it.,"I'm sorry for even buy this book. I just couldn't get through that hunderd page introduction. Its too long and not useful information, if he would had kept it short and simple. I feel, he does not know what he was translated it was very poor. How do I explain ""Tao Te Ching of Arthur Waley"" to my child or my wife in spanish who doesn't know the way of Taoist."
5,Wonderful Book,"This book describes the fascinating customs, etiquette and equipment used for teatime in the early 19th century. The 48 recipes for sandwiches and savories; scones, biscuits and tea cakes; tarts and pastries; cakes; sweet-meats, curds and creams enable today's cook to re-create the wonderful tastes of the past."
5,Great for Teens,"This is a product my daughter ordered because of it's popularity, we have a very difficult time finding. It's the best on the market."
4,No build up,"I like this product because I don't feel a build up on my hair like some other products I've used in the past. It also dries quicker when blow drying better than others. I have a natural curl to my hair and the product doesn't straighten it, but it does control frizz."
2,A dated account with only a few useful pieces of information,"The book was written at the height of Cold War (1986) and so it focuses on the superpower rivalry, studying the issue of submarine survivability in a nuclar war. The most interesting parts of the book were the chapters ""ASW Process and Operations"", ""Submarine Observables and Indicators"" and ""ASW sensors and their deployment"" which cover about 70 pages. The rest is outdated account of the submarine balance between the US and USSR and some scenarios of nuclear exchange. It would be better for someone interested on the ASW matters, to read the excellent books ""Submarines"" and ""Anti-submarine warfare"" published by Brassey's in the 1980s, which are much more general in scope and content more technical and tactical details."
1,One long bad joke,"The premise, that men are cavemen, is a funny one and the title gets a laugh. After a hundred pages it stops being quite so clever. Actually I would say it wears thin after about 2 pages. The book also seems to treat men as if it believes its title, it comes off dumbed down and spends as much time on really quite dull jokes as it does conveying any real information. Its only real use would be as a funny gift to a friend, who could then go and buy a real book."
2,Constant insults and bad jokes obscure good info,"This book does contain many helpful facts, but sadly the title is not just a one-off tease. The reader is constantly reminded that he is an oaf, and that probably the person who gave it to him thinks so. Well, me thag give bad review. To ladies who might think their partners might benefit from this book, the book assumes and reads like you are an idiot who knows nothing about science, fixing things, cooking or modern living. So you'll be suggesting that your partner is a loser. Just don't get angry if he retaliates by saying you look fat."
2,My husband was not a fan,"Got this book for my husband based on the reviews, but he found it to be condescending when he started reading it and complained."
2,"Ok book, wouldn't recommend it though","I purchased this book thinking it would be full of useful information for a first time dad (but presented with a little humor). Sadly, I found this book to contain only information I would consider common knowledge for just about anyone, first time dads included. Save your money here and purchase something else."
2,My husband felt talked down to,The book was funny at the beginning but after a while the constant mention of men being animals and worth nothing was just not amusing anymore. The entire book was just mocking men and my husband was insulted!! Not recommended for a serious book for the husband.
1,The moron's guide to pregnancy,"I bought this book for my husband when we found out we were pregnant thinking it was going to be cute, humurous and helpful. In my husband's own words, ""I hate books that treat men like morons and the silly pictures and quotes are terrible."" Save your time and money and buy a better guide for your husband!"
5,The Caveman's Pregnancy Companion,"I bought this book for my 39-year-old son, who is expecting his first bab y. It's the perfect book for the emotionally-contained ""tough guy"" (morning sickness annoys him), helping him to understand the reasons for all the fuss, in a hilarious way. The book has advice on cooking meals for a pregnant woman (you're gonna hafta), having sex with a pregnant woman, how to survive all the attention and so much more. The information is practical and funny and my son loved the book and loved even more that there was a book just for him (expectant fathers are so often very neglected throughout the pregnancy)."
1,Treats men like idiots,"I was given this book as a gift and was so turned off by the overuse of caveman analogies, I couldn't finish it.I think this book does more harm than good by re-enforcing negative stereotypes about men being uninvolved spouses and fathers. I understand the purpose of the book is about trying to ""evolve"" unenlightened men, but I am not one of their numbers.I tried to have a sense of humor about it and felt I gave the book a fair shot, but when the first handful of chapters are all about trying to impart some kind of wisdom or sense of responsiblity unto the father-to-be, you feel like you're being talked down to. It's not funny, it's not insightful, it's a whisper-thin concept a couple of bozos tried to hang a parenting book from.If you look at a lot of the positive reviews, they are written by women who bought the book for their spouses and boyfriends. Of course THEY think it's great. They're keeping their men like pets. An intelligent man wouldn't put up with this garbage."
3,"Good ""man info""","My hubby says that this book is okay. It seems a little tough to read because of the layout of the pages. He doesn't refer to it nearly as much as he refers to my ""mommy books."" It does have some good recipes, though."
3,"Good writing, but book needed to stay a character study","The writing was excellent - the author does a great job of switching writing styles when she goes from the mother to the son . She does an excellent job of conveying the characters love, pain, etc without being sappy. But, I think she dropped the ball when she decided to spin the story into a Lifetime Channel movie plot at the end. The book didn't need that. Frank could have suffered without going off the deep end. So, I guess you could say that I saw this book as an excellent character study that sort of went astray when it turned into an adventure story. The mix just didn't work for me. Too bad."
5,Bad Things Happen To Good People,America is giving birth to violence at an alarming rate. This is a story about one group of people who find themselves snared in the net of violence. They are good people caught in bad circumstances. What I found so convincing about this story was it's ability to view the world from the different perspectives of each character truthfully and painfully.
5,So Much Better Than The First Time...,"Without a doubt, this CD is above average. All the clarity, thoughtfulness, savvy and wit packaged into this project outshines all neosoul/hip-hop/r&b/urban alternative/nu-jazz and introspective rock CDs released that year. There are no disappointments- and Forte balances his ill-gained street credibility (via his lockdown) with his powerful, soul-wrenching introspective lyrics (it's hard to call them simply, 'lyrics') better than his more popular contemporaries that dare to shine light into their insipidly shallow, diamond-bezeled, champagne drenched lives. This is real hip-hop, or at least what I believe it should have evolved into. If you have been waiting for Mos Def to do another CD, and you have been severely disappointed by the copious effluence of r&b garbage on the radio, and you respect GENUINE talent- buy this CD. You will be glad, and sad. Sad that we have to wait 14 years for John's talent to shine again. However, he's certainly worth the wait."
3,Compendium of Screw-Ups,"This is a collection of vignettes, each usually about 4 or 5 pages in length, concerning mistakes made (usually by Generals) during the U.S. Civil War. Some of these are fairly well-known, such as the Battle of the Crater, when hundreds of Union troops marched into a huge crater created when engineers blew up an ammo dump, only to have Confederate soldiers simply stand on the rim of the crater and fire down on them at point-blank range; while others are stories previously unknown to me. I was unaware that President Lincoln appointed a number of generals from foreign countries, particularly Germany. There were some German generals in the Northern Army who spoke no English. There also seemed to be plenty of drunken generals, according to this book. There seemed to be a special level of incompetence in this war; I guess the drunkards and incompetents were balanced out by the Lees and Grants."
4,True stories of ordinary men in our greatest war,"An excellent read! Many of these little stories are well known but some were new to me, and I have been a student of the ACW for many years. This is not a ""scholarly work""; it is for people who like reading a few short essays a day. Good for beginners who want to get a ""feel"" for what happened from 1861-65 that didn't get into the ordinary texts."
1,A Disgraceful Compilation of Errors and Lies,"This book is, in short, a disgrace. It is full of factual errors from beginning to end, which is reason enough to avoid it. What is most disturbing, however, are the number of ""facts"" that the author has simply made up or inferred from circumstantial evidence. Many of the anecdotes in this book deserve to be to told and this could have been done in an interesting and effective way. The idea that history is only ""fun"" if it is made up, however, really is an abomination. Anyone who reads this will walk away from it believing many things about the most devasting war in U.S. history that simply are not true. Shame on the author and the publisher for ever releasing this book."
2,Disappointing,"The best thing about this book are the titles of the chapters. The titles are clever and promise good reading, but the chapters they head are far less interesting."
5,Excellent Bag,"I'm unaware of any airline that allows passengers to bring their strollers on board (review below). Instead, they permit you to 'gate check' it. Well, I don't believe that these people care about my stroller and they probably toss it into the storage area. If you want to protect your stroller from damage, I highly recommend.This bag will fold down small enough to fit into the small basket Maclaren strollers provide. It's easy to put the stroller inside (wide zipped area), and can stay folded in your luggage while you're out of town. I find it a great product."
2,Tore after one use,"I purchased the buggy bag last month for travel with my techno xt. I used it for the first time to gate check the stroller on one roundtrip flight (no connections). After returning home, I was dismayed to discover that the bag had already worn through the bottom near the wheels and that there was a 3-inch hole in the bag. I love the durability of my stroller, and I am very disappointed that the bag did not meet those same standards. I expected that the Maclaren brand bag would be of better quality. I contacted Maclaren and asked them to replace the bag. They refused and said that the tear was caused by stress that was not ""normal usage.""UPDATE: Maclaren contacted me and offered to replace the bag as a goodwill gesture."
3,"Not really necessary, and not so easy to use","Impeccable quality though.We bought this bag to protect our techno xlr stroller after hearing all sorts of horror stories about strollers on planes. Well, the horror stories were likely not a balanced reflection of reality, since every time we were the only paranoids bothering to bag our stroller, and other people's strollers on the same flights made it just fine to the destinations.In addition, we actually have to take off the shield/canopy to fit the stroller in the bag, and it does not fit in the basket which makes it pretty annoying to use. So unless you have a smaller mclaren stroller and do a lot of traveling, thus exposing your stroller to mistreatment, it's probably not worth buying."
3,Not an stroller airport bag,This is good for carrying the maclaren quest sport stroller anywhere except for airport check-in baggage. It is better to use the original cardboard box if you want your stroller to be totally safe from baggage handlers.
3,"Zipper broke, fabric torn","In principle, we like to use the bag to ensure that the stroller is protected upon gate check, even when it is somewhat of a hassel to stuff the XT in the bag in front of the plane. In about 20% of the flights, the ground crew does not recognize it as 'return at plane' item so that it ends up at the baggage claim with the other luggage. I wish it had large prints 'STROLLER' on both sides.The quality issues we have with it is that the zipper is made out of plastic, and broke after about 10 return flights. Additionally, although we hardly ever use the 'pull along' option suggested by the presence of the rolls, the fabric is ripped along the edge of the stiff material at the bottom of the bag. Those edges would clearly need some reinforcement.I must agree to other reviewers that this bag does not stand up to the same quality criteria as the buggies."
3,"Good protection, but a little too bulky","The bag definitely protect our expensive Maclaren well at the time we hand it over at the gate. However, if you're using the stroller at the airport, now you have to carry this heavy and bulky bag. It has wheels so we put our bags in it and strolled it along, but I wish it was easier to close and more compact to where you could just fit it in the stroller basket. It is also very large, meaning, it was not a tight fit, which again makes it very bulky. But it served its purpose as far as protecting the stroller from rough handling as the material is very thick and durable."
4,Join the Hatecrew,"Bodom seem to get increasingly aggressive with each album they put out. Hatecrew Deathroll saw the beginning of Alexi's almost tuned down and heavier riffing, and this trend continues on this album. Janne Warman's keyboards are a little more profound on this release than they were on Hatecrew, and are used best on the track ""Knuckleduster."" As usual Bodom put out a slamming album full of technicality and virtuosity. The four star rating is only because it only has two new tracks on it, and though they are awesome I still have to take off a star. The two covers are awesome, and even though I loathe A.W.K, Bodom's take on his song is awesome. Long live the Hatecrew."
4,Works great.,"I bought this cable to use at a recent wedding. It worked great on my flash bracket. I wish it were built a little tougher. I have a feeling I will break it pretty soon. But at this price, who cares! It did what I needed it to do, and it did it well."
4,Great for bounce,"You need this cable if you want to have more flexibility with bounce flash. I don't use it with a bracket, but want to be able to point the flash a bit behind (to a white wall), to the side, to the ceiling, whatever, depending on the effect I want and the surface that will give me the right bounce characteristics."
4,Fantastic sync cable!! I have only one gripe about it,"This is a great sync cable that allows all TTL functions to be used. I use it on an Olympus E-500. My only complaint is where you mount the flash to the unit, it is very difficult to tighten the flash down to the sync mount due to there being minimal room to get your fingers in there. Granted I have big hands, I am 6' 7"" in the mid 200 weight range, but they still could have designed this to allow just a bit more room for tightening the flash to he sync mount. Other than that it is a wonderful accessory! I purchased to use with a Vello CB-200 bracket."
3,Works with E-P1/2 but is not small,"This cable allows an Olympus flash to be mounted on Olympus E-P1/2 cameras. I use it on my E-P2 with the tiny Olympus FL-14 flash, to get shadow control and/or bounce flash. But this cable alone weighs as much (3.5 oz) as the whole FL-14 flash does. The miniaturization whizzes at Olympus need to design a lightweight cable to go with their new micro 4/3 cameras. In the meantime, this bulky thing (or the cheaper Chinese knock-offs) will have to suffice."
5,Love this monkey!,This is the sweetest looking monkey. My daughter loves it and takes it everywhere with her. Very precious!
2,If you only buy one book to prepare-don't buy this one,If you want to feel confident going into the INS test interview and you only want to buy one book don't buy this one. The information in Masi's book is basic and written very much for those with very limited English comprehension skills. All the information in this book can be downloaded (without the pictures) for free from the INS website. (...)
5,Excellent gift idea,Bought this for my little cousin for his 4rd Birthday and he loved it! He's a very bright kid and loves the I Spy series. So I had to get him the original. Arrived on time and in brand new condition.
5,Also a Guide to the Present Life,"I appreciate ""Guided Tour to the Afterlife"" with all my heart. Itaffirmed many things for me, and also gave me a sense of peace to feeland envision, from the very personal level Susan comes from, the stateof existence I came from and that to which I will return. I can saythat the insights I gained from Susan will actually help me live lifehere with more freedom and understanding and peace.Harriett and Susan have given the world a great gift. This is acutting edge book that everyone needs to read for encouragement increating happier lives for themselves. I can't imagine that there is aperson anywhere who wouldn't benefit from the information in its pages.I am very much looking forward to their next book."
1,Too Clinical For Me,"I lost my dear father recently and became quite interested in what he was experiencing in the afterlife. This was the first book I read on the subject and it was actually upsetting to me. I subseqently read a book by Echo Bodine, which I found much warmer, much gentler and more comforting. I was better able to reconcile my beliefs in God and the afterlife much more with Echo Bodine's book. It's helped me feel more at peace with my dad's continuing presence in my life. I hesitate to say anything negative about a book that's been a comfort to the other reviewers, but felt I needed to offer my differing opinion."
4,When will it be formatted for USA DVD players?,I was the assistent Art Director on this film. Haven't seen it yet since it's PAL format. Still waiting.
5,AWESOME,"This is pure thrash,I love D.R.I.,they are very original.They were the first ever band to do a blast beat on there first album in 83'.Definition is a great album,Acid Rain is a perfect song to start the album.They have there punk style to them like there lyrics,the lyrics rule,they always do!Guilt Trip is great,Paying To Play is awesome, all the songs rule.The Target,one of the best songs on the album.Here are some lyrics to some songs,Dry Heaves-I was drinking beerThen I was drinking JagarI know I shouldn't mix the twoI always pay later.Acid Rain-Will our children look backWith hatred or despairAt a generation of idiotsWho just didn't care.D.R.I. stands for Dirty Rotten Imbeciles.If you like original thrash bands, pick this album up."
2,Uninteresting,"This book is boring. It's draw, 30 prospects for each team, is very effective but the analysis is weak and usually breaks down to: ""This guy throws hard"" or ""This guy is a great athlete."" If you are really interested in minor league scouting reports I suggest John Sickels book published by Stats Inc. it has deeper, much more interesting analysis and a friendly writing style. Major dissapointment, no way I'm getting next year's book."
5,The Gay and Lesbian Self-Esteem Book,"Dr. Hardin's book is a powerful book that presents information vital to healing the wounds inflicted on gays and lesbians, both by society and by individuals, in a manner that is friendly, accessible and eminently usable without compromising on the complexity of the topic. The respect with which the subjects of his book and the readers are treated is healing in and of itself. This book is a must read for all gays and lesbians, their family, friends and coworkers and anyone interested in preventing the damage inflicted on individuals simply because of their sexual orientation. It speaks indirectly as well to members of other groups who likewise suffer discrimination because of group membership. As a woman, in a male dominated society, I found much of relevance to my own situation in his book. This book is an easy, accessible read whose implications and potential to better the lives of its readers are profound and anything but simplistic. I highly recommend it."
4,I wish my history classes had been this interesting!,"Once again, Hart has captured the tension and intrigue inherent in wartime. He takes a non-traditional view of the battle for Europe and Africa, showing the war to readers on an intensely personal level; through the eyes of a British motor torpedo boat captain serving in the Mediterranean. Not only is there a spell-binding plot, Hart's impeccable research will fascinate his readers."
5,"Soulfully ""sunnie"" rendition","This is an awesome work of the soul. It incapsulates the spirit of jazz and the generous nature of Sunnie Paxson. She shares openly the full of her life experiences and jazz intellect in this work. This is certainly going to the top of my favorites list. I especially like ""Spirit's in the House."""
5,Sunnie brings great jazz to the world,I listen to this cd constantly. I get home and put Sunnie's cd on.....all my stress is gone. I love jazz. It brings me to the great feeling you can have when everything is perfect. Thank you Sunnie for brightening up my life on those days when I need it. Love you Sunnie!!!
5,Wow! He doesn't shed anymore.,"This stuff really does work, my dog only sheds a very little amount now instead of constantly. His coat is also much more shinny."
4,great product,"This is a great product.. after using for a short period of time, my dogs coat is healthy and shiny. She no longer has a dull dirty looking coat due to usage of this supplement in her food."
5,Shed Relief works,I have a 6 year old white lab that sheds year round. He stays in the living room when we are room. He is outside during the day. Our hardwood floors stay covered with clumps of white yard. I started using the Shed ReliefLinatone Shed Relief for Cats - Daily Food Supplementand in 2 weeks I could tell a difference. I use to have to get out the shop vac to vacuum up the dog hair twice a week but now there is very little. I just put some on his food once a day.
1,"Oily, Messy","This product does not seem to be what it used to be.. It is an oily, messy product -- and my cat won't touch it. Formerly, the cat loved this stuff; it was almost a treat. Now, no matter how I offer it, this cat won't come near it."
3,Great product not sure about supplier,The balloons seem like they would be of great quality and the ones in the middle of the pack seem to work good. however I believe these either sat in a hot warehouse or a hot loading dock because when you twist them for balloon animals they get gummy at the twist and stick together. If the twist moves a bit it makes little holes which slowly delfate your new creation
2,"Great fun, but not worth the money at all!","This pack only comes with 24 balloons-- not much at all when you're making balloon animals. Like the other reviewer, I did find that most of the balloons popped easily. The price was not worth it at all. :( Comes to about 20 cents a balloon if you use the free shipping."
5,Balloon Kit,My 8 yr old asked Santa for this and hasn't stopped with it!!!! She got the idea for her carnival themed birthday party this past year and kept remaking the animals. She learned how to make new animals as well with the book! Book is great as well!!!
2,Balloons Popped,Trying to use these to practice for my kids birthday party. I popped several of them just trying to tie them. These are not durable.
1,Disappointed,"This was really a waste. You can not have any fun with this product. Hard to control, nearly impossible. I would not recommend buying this product"
2,broken too soon,"I got this remote heli for my 10 year-old's first christmas ever. Yes, it's true. Don't ask.Anyway, he sees the box; he knows what it is WEEKS before Christmas. The anticipation is killing him. He's so excited. He's jumping up and down begging me to let him open just one present early.Then the morning arrives and he tears into it. It was so difficult to remove from the carton/packaging that something broke and the propeller never worked right. He had never had such a fantastic toy; he had never experienced such tremendous anticipation; what a let down.It really was not only a major bummer for us all (even his little brother was sorry for him) but a waste of my hard-earned limited funds."
3,Have not opened the box yet,"We received this helicopter but it is still in the box. Although the description says it's for indoor and outdoor use, it's too big for us to use indoors. We will bring it outside in the spring so it doesn't get ruined if it lands in the snow."
3,Helicopter,Bought this for my 56 year old husband who always wanted one. It was broken within 10 minutes. I think they should have put in a few spare parts. Very difficult to learn on.
2,Not a great flyer,"The Dragon Fly is very limited in flight control, It has two channlrs (Up - Down) and (left - right). Missing is foward and reverse flight control. It does not fly so much as it just goes where it wants, It does however make a great static display helicopter."
1,Piece of Junk,This is your typical ISO - Instrument Shaped Object. Leaks like a sive. Breaks when you breathe too hard. Buy brand names only - not Chinese junk. This thing ended up in my garden as a lawn ornament.
3,"classic movie theatre serials of the 1950's, great","This is the stuff you went to the movies for back in the 50's. You couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen to our hero next, and how was he going to get out of it. Looking back on it now in the 90's, it's really bad acting, lots of action, and the special effects weren't all that bad. The movie Rocketeer is based on this serial, so how bad could it have been. It's camp, hokey and fun. If you miss this sort of stuff, It's GREAT!!"
3,Beginning of the end...,"This was a reasonable attempt to keep the serial genre going, but this was when such science fiction movies as DESTINATION MOON, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, and even ROCKETSHIP XM and THE MAN FROM PLANET X were starting an era of science-fiction movies of variable quality. Also, TV was encroaching on the territory... And so Republic tried to get on the s-f bandwagon. But this serial hardly had the sense of wonder of FLASH GORDON: THE SPACE SOLDIERS, THE UNDERSEA KINGDOM, BUCK ROGERS, etc. Much of it is earthbound, and mired down in typical failed attempts of the bad guys to get the needed materials with which to conquer the world. This does belong in any serial lover's library, but there are classics that I would recommend buying first, and then include this one after you have several of the unquestionable greats."
2,Appalling quality but fun,"This review refers to the Whirlwind Media DVD of Radar Men. I gather from other reviews that there was a Roan version which I'm sure was better. As for the serial itself, if you grew up watching Commando Cody and dreaming of flying with your own rocket suit, you'll enjoy this. Acting and dialong are, well, passible and there are some great Art Deco props left over from Flash Gordon & Buck Rogers. Alas, the video quality is wretched. Perhaps not as bad as a Madacy DVD but close. Still, the flying scenes are great--Commando Cody is surprisingly graceful."
3,There are much better serials,"Well, you know, a good old-time serial needs either a wonderful hero or a wonderful villain, or preferably both. The Flash Gordon series has both in the persons of Buster Crabbe and Charles Middleton. The Dick Tracy series has Ralph Byrd as the detective. The Phantom Creeps and the Return of Chandu have Bela Lugosi as a superb villain and surprisingly good good guy, respectively. I could go on. Unfortunately, Radar Men from the Moon has neither. The acting is stilted and stiff and one can hardly imagine why anyone would be afraid of the villain, the leader of the Moon who plans to invade the Earth. It has its campy moments and an occasional good special effect, like Commando Cody's frequent flying and a melting mountain, but these only make the film OK, not good. The list of better serials is long, but if you already have them, this is tolerable as background while you are answering email."
2,Stock Footage From Republic,"Track down Republic's memorable ""King of the Rocket Men"" (1949) and skip this cost-cutting chapterplay. Despite new visual effects from the Lydecker Brothers, the lackluster ""Radar Men From the Moon"" (1952) relies heavily on Republic stock footage. Roy Barcroft and Clayton Moore (who temporarily left ""The Lone Ranger"" in a salary dispute) provide solid villainy, but George Wallace's heroic Commander Cody is a total stiff. Though more sci-fi oriented than ""Rocket Men,"" the routine exploits of ""Radar Men"" mark a regrettable decline in the Republic serial tradition."
5,A great blast from my past,I grew up watching these serials on weekday children shows.We would make the helmets from either paper mache or emptyplastic bleach bottles.It is great that I can now introduce the Commando Cody serialsto my grandkids.Thanks.
3,Catamaran sailing,The book gives a good all round description. Illustrations could be better. Trim and techniques are well described and give a good overview of catamaran sailing.
3,10 Song Budget Collection,"This Best Of was one in a series of CD's that EMI Special Markets issued , but is now out of print. It gives you the basics of the higher charting hits with just 10 songs. Freda's Invictus label hits like BAND OF GOLD, which is immortal and timeless, and the anti-war song BRING THE BOYS HOME are here, with some lesser hits. This CD and all the others in the series [ such as Chairman of The Board, Laura Lee, Midnight Star, The 8th Day, The Whispers, and others ] was originally priced between $4.98-$6.98, but now being out of print, sellers are asking sky-high prices. Containing only 10 songs, and without any liner notes or songwriting credits, you can get a far more encompassing 1 or 2 CD set of Freda Payne's Invictus hits at a cheaper price. I'd recommend that over what sellers are asking people to pay for only a 10 song budget line CD."
4,Great Hoodie,I purchase this hoodie for my 15-year old son for his birthday because he is a big fan of Less Than Jake. The quality was better than I expected and I received it quickly! He loves it.
2,not up to quality standards,"I used this case once and then threw it away. Just not a good fit, bulky, and stiff."
1,couldn't get it to work,"I just couldn't get this program to run on my up-to-date XP system (click on the program to start it and nothing happens), and I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. Several queries to their ""customer support"" went unanswered. So I packed it up and returned it to Amazon for a refund (another good reason to buy from Amazon)."
3,"Through the Looking-Glass, In A More Childish Way!","Having been a hard searching person for the sequel, I stumbled upon the first part and decided to throw it into the large video collection I own. It has a great impression of Lewis Carroll's Alice stories, but with a modern twist. Jaime Reneé Smith plays out a young girl who recently gets an antique mirror from her dead grandmother. She discovers soon that it is a magical passageway to a world unlike her own. The special FX are good, the acting is pretty good but some of the story is very future-istic. I mean, catching children from other planets! FUTURE-ISTIC! But otherwise, this is a movie kids will cherish over and over again. I liked it, and so will you."
4,Attention Tobe Hooper fans,"I'm aware that the films of Tobe Hooper have been lackluster of late, but if you purchase this book you'll find out why. This is not only the best book about director Hooper, but a great book, period. The structure is very coherent, all valid points are made, and even though the author attempts to defend Hooper at times (which is fine with me), he's honest enough to admit when a film totally bombs out, i.e. ""The Mangler"". All in all, if you like Tobe Hooper, BUY this book. If you're a fan of the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Salem's Lot"" and/or ""Poltergeist"", BUY this book. You will not be disappointed."
2,too many glitches,"The direction to load it into DOS were great and you can start play really quickly. There is a bug in my game that will create a fatal error and start you back at the title screen during land base screen play. i called the seller and got no answer, so the game sits on the shelf."
3,?,"Its ok, not like the other x-com games. It was purchased for a friend. Not much feedback, jus its ok."
1,Disk 2 would not play,"Was so looking forward to receiving this because of the great reviews. Watched disk 1 and couldn't wait to see the second half of the AT on disk 2. Unfortunately, disk 2 will not play in the DVD player. Tested it on another player, and it would not play there either. Returned it to Amazon. Not sure if I should order another one because I am concerned that there might be a quality problem."
5,Perfect for family viewing. Professionally narrated. Exellent!,"I just finished watching this 2 dvd set. I give it my highest rating. I've seen ""Trek"", ""Walk for Freedom"", ""2000 Miles to Main"". Each has their appeal. This is a bit different. Unlike the others this DVD is professionally narrated. There are better explanations of what you are seeing through the camera. Also you get excellent well balanced comments from hikers all through the trail. Best of all. No profanity. So I recommend it for family viewing unike ""Trek"" and ""Walk for Freedom"". Good job Flagler."
5,This DVD will make you want to pack up and head to the trail!,"I am planning to start section hiking the A.T. I bought this DVD so that I could get a perspective of the terrain and what other hikers' experiences were. I popped it in the player just as soon as it arrived and I was ready to hit the trail after watching it. I can't hardly wait now, but I guess I better get my gear together first. I liked the way the DVD was professionally produced, and the fact that you can select a section of the trail from the menu without searching through the DVD if you want to review a certain part. I was apprehensive in spending the extra money for this documentary, but the other reviews encouraged me to splurge. Glad I did!"
5,What a fun trip!,"Since buying this DVD set I have watched it twice. I've never hiked the AT but am tentatively making plans to do so within the next couple of years. I would like to thru hike and these videos are the ""carrot on a stick"" that just might push me to do it."
5,Must see DVD,I have just finshed seeing the DVD three times and I could watch it again. This is a good movie with alot of good information for someone wanting to hike the trail and you will not get bored looking at it. I feel that they did a good job putting it together and it gives to something to look forward to when hiking the trail.
3,Lite Reading - High School Level,"Trivia facts - some interesting, some boring. One day, the country will come to appreciate the office of vice presidents. Since 1980 to the present, the office has grown in importance and power."
4,Midnight Star the journey continues,"I have been a fan of this band since the Victory lp. It is really hard now days to get extended originals such is the case here as well. However, this compilation does rock the boat, if you know what I mean. Missing is Electricity one of my favorites but, you can't go wrong with this one. The only thing to make it better is to add the 12in. versions of their songs. That I would buy in a heartbeat. Overall, this should keep you funky for a good thirty-five or so minutes. Now, the vocals are tight, the music is on hit, there is no miss on this. Even the edited version of freak-o-zoid brings back memories of long nights at the clubhouse. Can I get a live album outta this band? There has got to be some live material hanging around studio or in someones house I want it. Do yah'll hear me? I want a live version, not from when they were about to call it quits, I mean from when they were at their best, can I get an Amen brother?! Amen brother."
3,"Typical Mish-Mash, Flawed by Obvious Inaccuracies","Well, a lot of this is old hat. Aliens, underground bases, governments being funded by drug sales, and the like.Here's my deal. How seriously can we take the research of a book who tells us that the JFK assassination was on November 19, 1963. Not only that, we're told that when Oswald defected to Russia, he took his wife along!I'll be really disappointed in you, fellow conspiracy buffs, if you did not know that the correct date of JFK's assassination was Friday, November 22, 1963; or that LHO married Maria AFTER he defected to the USSR.Now, these are two very simple things to know. If he got those wrong, how much else has Piccard gotten wrong?Seems to me that his wild'n'wacky claims might themselves be disinformation from ""THEM.""By now, it is clear that by casting your conspiracy nets wide enough, everybody but you and me are under suspicion of bring part of ""THEM.""And I'm not sure sure about YOU, buddy!"
1,Rambling Incoherent Gibberish,"Mr. Picard is a little off the left field wall with some of his conspiracy ideas. The two that really got me to thinking was the idea that the Nazi's have established a base at the South Pole and are waiting for the right time to attack unsuspecting earthlings. The other dealt with contrails that jet liners leave behind as the travel from place to place dlivering people and cargo. Mr. Picard believes that they are actually spraying the countryside from 35,000 feet. He evens throws in a gentleman who has tested the contents of these contrails and found that they do indeed contain harmful chemicals. I'm just wondering if this particular gentleman used a very long step ladder or used another jet to get the samples?His Liquid Conspirators are content to just sit and let the rest of us screw up the world and they will step in take control. That sounds like a plan to me!"
2,Don't bother,"McGee's commentaries are essentially transcripts of his old radio shows. There's nothing bad or incorrect here, but for the serious Bible student there's just not enough meat or insight here to bother with."
5,An unsung hero of the flute,"I am a flute player and collecter of great flute music. I am also a longtime listner of coyote oldman music, of which Barry Stramp is a member. He is the technical genius behind the ""atmospheric sound"" of the group. He brings this sound to his solo work. He demonstrates masterful playing with the shakuhachi,kena, bansuri, and siku flutes. Each song has different depth and feeling. Once you you have soaked in the music, you will want to ""rinse and repeat"", as quoted by a popular guitarist. This music is for those who want to relax and unwind, it also helps to focus. I would highly recommend this cd to anyone looking for good and uplifting music."
4,Works great!,I have long nails that chip easily and this product kept this from happening. This product is easy to use (Don't over-use) with results that aren't noticeable. After a week or so I realized that I wasn't having to file chips as often and then not at all! I ran out of Dr.G's Liquid diamond and had problems finding this product for about 6 months. My nails stayed harder for quite a while and then started chipping again. A few more treatments and my nails look awesome!
4,Love,My family loves the calming music and expressive lyrics of Jack Johnson. We love singing along to these songs for the younger set.
5,great for kids and adults - Jack Johnson's calming for all.,"very nice, one of my wife and daughter's favorite cds.promotes a mellow atomsphere."
5,Very cute track!,"We love this album as much as we like the movie! We are Jack Johnson fans and after hearing this soundtrack we rented the movie, it's very cute and the music style is perfect!"
4,Fun for kids,"Our family is very much a Jack Johnson family. I bought this as a first CD for my two-year-old neice. She loves it and often when I come to visit it is playing in her room as she plays. She enjoyes it, AND parents don't mind listening to it too (it beats Disney Tunes)!"
4,One of His Best,"I have not seen the show, however this CD has some of Jack Johnsons best music. Just like all his music, it is approprate for all family members."
5,great for kids and grownups,"I have probably listened to this cd 5000 times. My kids love it and the grown ups like it to. The songs are fun, original and have great messages. The sharing song is probably our favorite. I also the song about recycling. We liked the cd so much we bought a copy for my son's preschool class."
5,Great for all ages,"As stated in the title, this album is great for all ages. I purchased it for my kids, but find myself listening to it, often. If you want a soothing, mellow, fun album for your kids, this is it."
4,Father and daughter actually enjoy the same music!,"My 4 year old daughter (who saw Curious George with me on its opening day) now shares my enjoyment of Jack Johnson through this soundtrack. I never expected that we would have any of the same interests in music, but sure enough, we're singing along together to possibly my favorite artist.The guy amazes me - he seems to have this uncanny universal appeal that transcends genres - and now transcends generations...The soundtrack itself is pretty solid - not great all the way through like some other Johnson efforts, but plenty of catchy, mellow tunes that are destined to be classics."
3,Disappointing,"Jack's older stuff was soooooooooooooo much better than this... he's almost getting ""sellout-ish."" i can't even listen to Upside Down because i've heard it so many times... in all, get his older stuff (his other 3 are AMAZING).. skip this one"
4,pretty good cd,"this cd is pretty good, some of the songs are childish, but cute. this cd was not my favorite of jack johnson's but i enjoy it. four stars!"
5,Great music!,"I love this cd. I bought it for me, but the kids love it as well. Shared it with a few teachers and they've bought it for their classrooms."
5,Great CD for little ones and big ones alike,"This is my 3rd Jack Johnson CD, so I knew it would be good. This has some fun songs that are great for kids, though even those have a lot of clever and humorous lyrics that the adults will appreciate. As with any other Jack Johnson CD, I have a difficult time telling you which tracks are my favorite because it sometimes changes with each listen. Each track is what I've come to expect from this artist, and just like the other CDs, if you aren't crazy about a track the first time through, don't worry. It may end up becoming one of your favorites. Some songs jump out at you immediately and you love them instantly. Some of his songs just need a little more time to grow on you, but you'll probably end up loving them all in the end. Typical outstanding Jack Johnson work, and the guest artists actually add a lot of variety to the CD as well. GREAT CD!"
5,We all love it!,"The entire family listens to this CD. We've even burned it to our ipod so we can travel with it. The kids like to sing along, as do we. This is the album that introduced us to Jack Johnson, and now we own all of his albums that we can find.I also love that we can listen to this one with the grandparents. My son prefers Metallica and heavy metal music, and my daughter, Jack Johnson or Peter, Paul, and Mary. We listen to a wide variety of music at our house.Another good point is that this isn't the traditional 'kiddie' fare - I don't care for the children's albums in general - too cheesy and well, intended for kids. This album appeals to all of us, regardless of age. Anyone who has ever been subjected to lengthy car rides with toddlers and toddler oriente music will understand what I'm talking about. There are only so many times an adult should sing BINGO or Itsy Bitsy Spider. Really."
5,Curious George=Pure & Innocent Music,"We are absolutely impressed with the Jack Johnson selections on this c.d. My girls (ages 11, 5, and 2)tap and groove to every song and can listen to them repeatedly. Children's music doesn't get any more pure than this!"
5,Excellent - For the whole family!,"This CD is amazing. True Jack Johnson style, and kids and adults alike can enjoy it. Say goodbye to those annoying Barney CD's, I could listen to this one over and over again... Particularly great in my opinion are Broken, Lullaby, and Supposed To Be.. dont miss this one!"
5,Worth every penny!,This CD is so great! I only have one other J.J. CD and have really enjoyed it. I thought it was time I bought another one so after seeing the advertisment for this CD I thought I'd give it a try. I am so happy that I purchased this one! My 9 month old daughter especially loves dancing with me while we listen to it. Wonderful! Outstanding! Love it!
5,Great!,I bought this album after my two-year-old daughter fell in love with the movie. The music is great!
2,Curious George CD,CD arrived in good shape but it is not at all what I thought it would be. This is not a sing-along CD. It seems to be misrepresenting itself with such a title. Not impressed or satisfied with this CD. It was reviewed to be something different. It's simply music by Jack Johnson which tends to be very slow.
3,nice CD,"most of the best songs on this cd are frequently heard on the radio...but the rest of the tunes are pleasant/most suitable for background music or for amusing kids, i guess"
1,numbing,"Only a guy who's been considered ""dreamy"" or ""swell"" all his life would make music like this. It's the sort of numbing, neutral, middle of the road pap that has such little inpact on any living thing that one wonders why the effort (& believe me it couldn' have been much) was even made. I wouldn't be surprised if he falls asleep in the middle of recording sessions; or maybe they just wheel his entire bed into the studio. He's like Perry Como on morpheine.This is the ""hunky dory"" b.s. music that I'm confident is playing in hell."
2,*Yawwwn*,"Just because pop music has an acoustic guitar doesn't mean it's any more sophisticated, or any less predictable than Jessica Simpson's latest single. Jack Johnson isn't interesting enough to be either loathed or enjoyed, really; It's inoffensive music for an easily offended mind. And I'm sorry to say, but the album cover is honestly unsettling. I hope you're not trying to lure children to your house with Curious George drawings, Jack..."
3,Nick Drake wanna be.,I hope Jack Johnson has an alter with Nick Drake's picture on it and many lit candles around the picture in his house. Is it just me or did this guy completely take Nick Drake's sound and style?Don't get me wrong - the music sounds good - I can enjoy it.
4,Great for my daughter and me both!,"Before I took my two year old daughter to see this movie, I bought the soundtrack, and we both love it! It's nice to finally listen to a child's CD that I can enjoy as well as my daughter. I am a fan of Jack Johnson, so it was pretty much a ""no-brainer"" purchase for me. As soon as we get into the car she says, ""I want to listen to George...he's sweet!"""
5,Better 95 study guide than most others available,"I read New Rider's MCSE Win95/networking essentials book cover to cover and still felt unready for the test. I read Que's book in four days at a local bookstore and was very impressed and more importantly, very confident for the exam. Passed the first time!I feel guilty for not actually purchasing the Que book but will definately look to purchasing Que books for the other MCSE exams."
4,Not smiles and sunshine,"This book is shrouded in a deep, darkness that took a little while to pierce. I found it made me think about the psychology behind suicide, depression and how our own actions can have drastic effects on others around us.Tempest and Patrick seemed very real to me. They weren't Hollywood-ised, Tempest was a big girl, insecure, yet strangely confident. Patrick had a serious problem with the relationship with his father. They were portrayed with their warts and all.None of what occurred in this book was all smiles and sunshine, but I got a feeling of hope from the ending. I would not recommend this for teens, 16yrs and above only."
5,Newcomer's Handbook to Seattle,"I purchased this book for my son when he moved to the Seattle region. I was concerned some of the information would be outdated because it was published 3 - 4years ago. My concern was not warranted! The book offers extensive information on everything one would need when moving to a new place. From things like where the post office is in each regional area, to the process for voter registration, to home costs, school information, motor vehicle requirements, and on and on.Wonderful book for a newcomer to the Seattle area and the state of Washington!"
4,good resource,"this is good comprehensive resource for those moving to seattle. its full of useful information. i used it to read about different neighborhoods, figure out where to buy furniture, how to set up my phone, and get general information about the city from across the country. its great"
3,Lots of Info,"Has tons of useful info. A little hard to get through because of all the info, but a good resource to have handy."
4,"Hoped for better, but worth it","I purchased this book when I was moving to Seattle (naturally) and it was certainly worth the money I spent on it. It was a handy reference guide to the things I would need to do once I moved, as well as a directory of information about places, shops, malls and other kinds of services that are are necessary and useful.However, since most of the same information is available on the Internet, I would have appreciated a critical assessment of various aspects of Seattle life described in the book. For instance, I would have preferred something like ""ABC and XYZ malls provide the best quality of service"" as opposed to a listing of addresses and telephone numbers of twenty different malls.Still, there is a lot of useful information and advice in this book, and I would definitely recommend it."
2,Not very useful,Didn't use this book at all. Had hoped for info I wouldn't be able to find. For me was a waste of money.
2,A pathology instructor from CA,"While good in intentions and accurate in information presented, the book lacks clear and concise order and becomes very confusing for the begining pathology student. It also focuses too much on obscure conditions while ignoring more common ones. Very disappointing."
4,"Fleeting, ephemeral beauty","Neither wholly poem or narrative or argument, this slight volume sits in your hand and is an aesthetic beauty. The language is a pleasure, and we should thank both Breton and his translator for this work. It is part dream, part reality as the rock crumbles and we face our own impermanence. It is notNadja, but something different.My thought while I read was this: ""Reading for a glint in the darkness, you find something beautiful, but even with it in your hands, you cannot tell anyone what it is or not as a deficit of your descriptive powers but because there is nothing you can describe it with."" A thing of fleeting and ephemeral beauty you have to hold."
4,Got a new dog and don't know what to do?,"This is a great book with all kinds of tips for all dog owners. Your dog reacts to you, so this book can help you find the answers you've been looking for. It's written in a page by page format so it isn't just a bunch of lists on what you should do to have a happy and well-trained dog. I am very interested in dogs and this was a real page turner for me and I would definately reccomend this book to anyone wanting to learn about their best friend!"
4,"Easy to read, enthusiastic book","I purchased this book prior to picking up my 9 week old puppy. I loved reading the book- highlighting all the important details and methods. Before attempting to apply the methods, I would definitely have given the book 5 stars. However, I've now had my puppy 4 days, and the ""growling"" behavior that is so prevalent in the book just doesn't work. I'm disappointed because the book makes it sound so exciting and foolproof. I still refer back to the book for many other good ideas, but I will be having to find another training method other than ""growling"" for a feisty little pup."
2,This book is just ok,"I grew up with dogs, and bought this book because I had never raised a puppy on my own before. The book made a couple good points, but overall was a waste of money. Maybe this book would be better for someone with absolutely no dog experience. I'd say that if things in the book conflict with your instincts, go with your instincts. Certainly don't take this book to be doggie gospel."
3,More of the same,I just got season 5 yesterday and already watched the first side of disc 1. Looks like this season is edited just like 2-4. I did notice on the box it did say edited content for DVD release. I don't know what is missing but so far the episodes are ranging between 15-20 minutes. I HOPE sometime in the future FOX entertainment will find a way to release some of the missing stuff or at least the music video parodies. It's better that we got something than nothing.
3,"In response to ""Married...With Children""","24 minutes was NOT how long each episode was. FOX shows from that time generally range between 22:30 and 23:15, no longer than that. So if the total time you posted is right, we might finally have another uncut DVD set for In Living Color (season 1 being the other). If that's the case, I might just end up buying season 5. I bought 1 and 2, and skipped 3 and 4 due to the large amount of edits. I'll stick with recording those seasons from BET. The replacement music will be the only other issue, but I'd rather have replacement music than chopped up episodes."
1,Awful!,"This final season is just ridiculous...and not in a good way.When the Wayans abandon a project, then you know it is unfunny and over. Just look at the Scary Movie films.Kelly Coffield left because the producers wanted to use Alexandra Wentworth more. A huge mistake! Kelly was hilarious.Save your money and avoid this stinker season."
3,Not bad...,Old Fare...the series had become tired by now. I bought it to round off the entire 5 seasons for my collection.
5,Just as Good as the First Four!!!,Jim Carrey and Jamie Foxx are a riot as always. Chris Rock only adds to the hilarity. I loved this season! It is definitely worth the buy!
2,"When the wayans, J.LO, Kelly Koffied left then so did all the talent","When shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang. But saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks. Now dont get me wrong, it was funny, I'll give it that, that's the only reason it got 2 stars, but season 1-4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure IN LIVING COLOR wise. So I'd recomend this for the series collectors like me. meaning I have season 1-4 and although I didnt like season 5, I'd feel uncomplete without it."
4,When you're onto a good thing . . .,"If ""Play"" wasn't such a great listen then I would have been very dissapointed that Moby's new Cd ""18"" was so similar. It's perhaps even more mellow than ""Play"" with heaps more sampling from old gospel/blues tracks and a lack of anything that resembles ""Bodyrock"" or any of his earlier techno/rave stuff. It's good though - and even if the test of time proves it to be inferior to ""Play"" I'm sure those who loved that album (and there were many!) will learn to love this one. In fact this doesn't even require a review as such. it's exactly what you would expect."
4,"An interesting evolution from ""Play""...","If you're looking at this album, it's most likely for one of two reasons: 1) you are a Moby fan and are celebrating his new release, or 2) you heard the album's first hit, ""We Are All Made of Stars"". I had listened to this hit many times, and I really enjoy the song - the rest of the CD, however, is different from this song. Having listened to the entire CD, I can honestly say that if you're a fan of Moby, you will enjoy this as much as his previous release. Songs such as ""We Are All Made of Stars"", ""Extreme Ways"", and ""Jam for the Ladies"" are great vocal mixes. Other songs such as ""Fireworks"" are nice instrumentals. In conclusion, while Moby's musical style in this album differs from that in ""Play"", his uniqueness remains intact; seasoned fans as well as newcomers will enjoy Moby's newest release."
5,Moby Scores!,Chalk up another one for Moby - I purchased this yesterday and have listened through three times - I love this album. The thing that attracts me to Moby's works is the obvious intelligence and thought that goes into his recordings and sampling - this guy has listened to a lot of music and knows his history! Moby - I sure appreciate your efforts - it was worth the money.
4,not bad but not play...,"I know that I am with many of my fellow Moby fans when I say that '18' is not as good as 'Play' but does that make it a bad album?This CD has been in my player continuously since i purchased it. Sure, most of this CD isn't at the same level of many tracks from Moby's previous album (Porcelian, Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad, Everloving, My Weakness, and even South Side), but that doesn't make this CD ""bad"" at all. It moves at a much different pace, and every track is an enjoyment, especially the first 3 or 4 tracks. Taken alone, '18' is a great album, I would strongly suggest it, especially if you loved 'Play.'"
2,Overrated,"Moby's popularity puzzles me. He takes a rather weak ""hook"" and repeats it over and over and calls it a song. Lyrics, same thing. Almost every one of his songs follows a ""Moby formula."" Perhaps it is because he goes for the ""lowest common denominator"" that he appeals to so many people [ NOTE: Back in the 70's when I tried to get some people to listen to Emerson, Lake & Palmer's ""Tarkus"" they complained that it was too ""complicated"" for them. ]The only good thing he has done is show that with an Apple G4 computer and ProTools it is possible to record a CD and have someone listen to it. I hope that it inspires some budding ""composers"" to reach out and go for it... and write some really good songs."
4,wandering among the stars,"a balanced work by a visionary artist: balanced in the sense of delivering the delightful pop, gospel and jazzy electronica elements without going ""over-bored"" with politico musings or hyperkinetic metal wanderings.Overall a very enjoyable album."
2,Play encore,"This CD is a lot like Play, but the ingenuity has worn off. A lot of the songs sound the same. The best track is ""Fly So High"" but that's about it. Moby has made a point in the past that he doesn't want to keep doing the same thing (he did techno, then rock, now pop), but this album seems to be the exception to the rule.Moby: leave Pop behind, and come back to Techno!"
2,"8, not 18. A lot of bland filler.","Sure, Moby's terrific. Very talented. If only he'd put that talent to use on this album. Many of the tracks are just droning synth strings, some with bland and boring vocals. It's as if he stood in front of his keyboard, punched in strings or pads, and leaned on a few major chords for 3 or 4 minutes and called it a song. Come on, man, we're paying for these discs. As always, I uploaded the CD to my computer, but out of the 18 tracks I copied only 8 that I thought were worth repeat listens. Surprisingly, the best tracks were the ones where Moby sings -- and he's not a great singer. Bottom line is I guess I'm glad bought it, but at the same time I feel a bit cheated cheated and let down. Start with his other albums, like Play, first."
4,"""Play"" it again?","This is not a repeat of the ""Play"". Yet it is not an advancement of musical skills.It's more like a best of...with new music.Moby revisits himself. An interesting idea.From ""Go"" to ""Everything is wrong"" to ""I like to score"" to ""Play."" All bases are covered.The only thing really missing is some rock and roll ala ""Animal Rights"".Buy the album. It is good."
2,Fair,A Decent album with decent material but nothing else. Moby has become one of the most annoying musicians in the music industry to day and there is no wonder why everybody has gotten sick of him. This album sounds exactly like Play and most of the songs are just so boring just like he is in real life. Please try to make good music and stop thinkin if MTV is going to play your videos. Moby ranks with Eminem as the most boring and most unentertaining artists in the music business today thanx.
1,Bordering on ...,What a difference between albums - the last one nearly every single track was excellent while on this one 2 of the 18 tracks are ok with the rest as filler. Shame on Moby who is talented but seems to have lost sight of what makes a good album. And 18 tracks are way too much - should have focused on doing 8-11 great songs. Give this one a skip.
2,its the same old stuff,"I was a fan of moby back before ""Play"" was popular. I thought moby was my secret artist that no one else knew about. A couple years later he wins some grammies and even my most mainstream-listening friends have his album. It looks as if on this album instead of using his eclectic/genius mind to create something out of this world and futuristic, he goes with the exact same forumla as he did for ""play"". Old gospel recordings with boring piano riffs accompanied by drum beats. It was great to do that on ""play"" because no one had done it before, but it looks like now moby has REALLY sold out to his stardom. This album is like a sequel to Play, and not near as good. His first single, ""we are all made of stars"" i thought was a terrible song from the get-go, and hoped the rest of the album would be better. Well, after many repeated listenings, i can say that this album isnt any better."
4,A PRETTY GOOD ALBUM,"I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS ALBUM SINCE I SAW IT HAD ""JAM FOR THE LADIES"" ON IT. SINCE I LIKED THE MIX OF THE SONG ON THE TOMB RAIDER:CRADLE OF LIFE SOUNDTRACK, I FIGURED I'D LIKE THIS VERSION. DON'T GET ME WRONG, THE SONG IS GREAT BUT YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO IT A FEW TIMES IN ORDER TO FULLY ENJOY IT. THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS OK, NOT BAD BUT NOT PERFECT.THOUGH, I WAS EXPECTING MORE OF A EURO/TECHNO SOUND."
2,Did Moby fall asleep at the wheel?,"This doesn't sound like Moby, where did he go? I guess I was expecting something better than ""Play"", but I assume those days are over. Here it is: short but sour... to mellow and slow. Oh well, at least Crystal Method released a new album."
3,"A few good tracks, but some crap too...","I was at the public library one day and I saw this CD. Being a world-class tight wad, I checked it out and burned it when I got home. Free music sounds better. This CD is pretty good. I'd give it three and a half stars. It gets pretty repetitive after a while, but it's worth a listen or two. Find it at your local library. Take that, recording industry."
5,Moby Is The Best!,"This album of Moby's is the best and I'm a fat dirtbag named John Strickland. I Listen to the album 24 - 7! It's great, you should buy it!!! I think that eminem and Moby should collaborate in the remix of ""We are Stars!"" The album is awesome. It has collaborations with Blink 182, Missy Elliott, Notorious BIG, and 2Pac Shakur. The hidden track at the end of the album is a phone convo with Moby and his old prison buddies (hahahaha). It's pretty funny. The best song is track 5. It features Macy Gray and P. Diddy. ""I am Moby, my mom wanted me to be Toby, what a phony..."" Thats one of it's good lyrics. BUY THIS CD!!!"
2,Chintsy production,"I wouldn't classify myself as an audiophile, but I can't listen to this without being annoyed by the cheesy-sounding instrumentation. It sounds like someone in a music store playing with a mid-range synthesizer and a reverb unit. And the ""cello"" on Great escape just makes me cringe. I think electronic strings can work wonderfully when they're supporting a larger piece, but to have just a synth cello and voice sounds, well, [not so good]. It seems like Moby can appreciate the contrast between old grainy samples and crisp digital rhythms, and I wish he'd gone to a little more effort into using a similar contrast between analog instruments and synth."
3,Extremely Average . . .,"Moby Moby Moby . . . I wouldn't want to have to follow up 'Play' either . . .I didn't find this terribly imaginative. We Are All Made of Stars is likely the most boring song ever written. 18 has all of this potential, but the songs tend to fall flat. Some tracks are simply 'Play' outtakes (and these are sadly the best). Give up the guitar too. Oy! At times I wondered if I were listening to some sort of Alan Parsons Project parallel universe . . ."
3,"18: starts fresh, ends stale","This album definitely surprised me. A longtime fan of Moby from his early underground days to his recent transcendance into blue/folk/soul trippiness, I tend to be happy with whatever Moby does. The album started off promising, with three great songs (1-3, three being the best on the album) in a row. And then, it crashes. Moby samples widely throughout the album, which is fine if done creatively. I'm not saying I could have done better, but the first 3 peices were pretty moving, and then he deteriorates. I just didn't feel like there was any meaning behind the remaining songs;they were filler. A lot of synthesizing and orchestra try to hype it up, but one something is missing. Almost no techno present, and lots of bluesy riffs that lack any semblence of a climactic procession (**translation: they drag on with no point). It was like PLAY without the catchiness--and don't get me wrong, I loved PLAY. Buyers beware, and don't say I didn't warn you!"
3,"Decent, but I think I'll stick with ""Play""","Play is my personal favorite album from Moby. 18 is...well, it's sort of a mixed bag. I mean, I like the melodies and the ambiance of the songs. However, unlike Play, this album lacks variety and most of the songs sound the same. I do wish there were more energetic songs here. Also, the music sounds the same as from Play, so it's more of a rehash than a brand new album. But on the plus side, there are several good songs on the album: ""We Are All Made Of Stars,"" ""Extreme Ways,"" ""18,"" and ""I'm Not Worried At All."" There could have been more dance tunes like ""Bodyrock,"" but I guess the soft sounds are appropriate after the September 11th attacks (this album was released only a year after the horrific event). Still, I'm somewhat neutral about 18. There are some good songs, but I do wish it was different from the recent album.Grade: 5.5/10"
3,Is it a RePlay on SLow Motion?,"When I hear this album I cant help but amuse myself into thinking that Moby hung out with THE CURE while recording this!The cd as a whole is much darker, lamenting and melancholic. You will find yourself closing your eyes and brooding more often than jumping up and dancing. By far, my favorite track on the album is EXTREME WAYS for its catchy piano and signature beats and strings.My only substantial criticism is that he seems to use the SAME piano/strings combination as he did on play. But its done so often on this album, that you have to wonder if he's just recycling the same loops... give it a hear, and you'll see what I mean :)"
1,This CD is REALLY terrible!,"Many times, I need to play a CD several times to understand and appreciate what an artist intended to express that wasn't apparent on the first listening. Every time I play this CD, however, I wonder why I wasted my money on it. This has got to be some of the most bland, uninspired music I've heard in a long time. Moby's formula of using repetitive loops with found vocals lifted from obscure gospel or soul artists is very stale to say the least. His original compositions are so amateurish, I've heard more polished, interesting electronic compositions from complete unknowns who post their music to web forums. ... I believe his previous CD, ""Play"" was possibly just a stroke of luck in that it was reasonably decent. He is reverting back to the marginal lack of talent that he showed in his earlier efforts. ..."
1,The worst excuse for an album that Moby has ever created....,"Alright, I consider myself to be a big fan of Moby. I've been listening to his music since the very beginnings, over 10 years ago. He's created albums that I consider to be masterpieces. This album, however, is a complete disaster. I knew Moby was on the way to becoming a sell-out, when all of the tracks from the album Play were sold for commercial purposes. This was something I eventually came to terms with. But the total lack of creativity that this album is comprised of is truely astounding. This is clearly evident in the song, ""We Are All Made of Stars,"" a total and complete travesty. He should be ashamed to put his name an album that is soo comercialized and mainstream. My advice, but any album by Moby EXCEPT THIS ONE!!!!"
2,very Average,"I got a chance to hear this disc all the way through Courtesy of MTV 2&I was amazed at how the amount of Numbers He does.I think Personally He is a Good Re-Mixer but as a Artist&Producer?? Forgettaboutit.I Like ""Harbour"" With Sinead O'Connor.She is A Artist that made some Decent Records but has long since all been but forgotten.so I think it's cool Moby Brought Her on this Track.But ...the tracks for the most part are more closer to left-over Enya tracks than Material from a Artist that the Critics will have you believe is on to something new.He has Talent but not on the level with all the Hype He gets."
3,"""Extreme"" Ways","Does anyone know if the song ""Extreme Ways"" has an instrumental version? I love this song from ""The Bourne Identity""'s credits. I prefer not to have the actual singing since the tune itself is awesome."
2,Not Much to Cheer About,"I am sure Moby was under incredible pressure to match the success of his hugely popular Play. The pressure must have got to him because this effort falls short. I admire him for not trying to duplicate his sound on Play, but the fact is that most of this album sounds uninspired. I enjoyed listening to a couple of the tracks, but the other 16 wee little more than white noise. Hopefully Moby will be back with his next effort and offer something with a little more meat to it."
3,A decent album,"18 was the follow-up to Moby's successful album, Play. Sonically, 18 took Play to ""the next level."" However, I think the 18 album could have been a bit stronger. Changing the sequencing of the album would have helped it tremendously (the second half of the album has a ""sameness"" to it, which makes it hard to listen to that part of the album after a while).For me, 18 is definitely a ""mood album""; I have to be in a particular mood in order to listen to it in its entirety. Those fans who enjoy Moby's more upbeat and danceable material probably won't like 18 as much. While this is a decent album, it's definitely not the one I would use to introduce someone to Moby's material (for that purpose, I would use either Everything is Wrong or Play)."
3,OK in Small Doses,"I have a hard time listening to this album's ""18"" tracks in one sitting. The overall tone and sound gets monotoneous and quickly grinds on my nerves. I consider ""Jam for the Ladies"" to be the only dud. However, there are not any really great tracks on 18 either. Something fans of Moby's previous albums have come to expect. Most of the tracks are average with five or six being slightly better than average (tracks 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 17), but even these are more enjoyable when heard interspersed on a personal playlist rather than on Moby's 18 album.3.5/5 stars."
4,Continuation of sound of Play and Songs: 1993-1998,"It sounds like a blend of Play and Songs: 1993-1998. Mellow and smooth. If you're looking for fast techno, try an earlier album. If you are looking for something relaxing and trancy, with ethereal voices and tunes, this is it."
2,disappointed,"Overall the album is listenable however, nothing sticks out, nothing's innovative, nothing is ""new"" sounding. Most of the tracks sound like they're composed of recycled samples from his previous albums. Most tracks are ""downtempo"" and could make a good CD to play for background music, but that's about it - nothing memorable."
2,Sometimes sticking to what you know best may be the worst,"I bought this CD right when it came out and I was very disappointed. This is, in fact, Play Part 2. There is nothing fresh here and the played out melodies heard on ""Play"" get quite old here. This album may work for those of you who haven't heard the critically acclaimed ""Play"" because it takes the same formula and basically kills it when comparing the two albums. The first single ""We Are All Made of Stars"" does budge and it does work on certain levels, but it isn't anything to rave about. The appearance of Sinead O'Connor on another track on the album isn't that magnificent either. My recommendation is to definately get ""Play"" (if you don't already have it) and forget that this CD was ever made."
5,BUY IT!!,"This is a great release! Not only that, but every song is so different from the next that it never gets boring. Great traveling, or music at work too!"
2,"Same old, same old...","I was waiting for this new release for a long time. So much hype, so much exciting. But when I finally got it it was a big disappointment. I understand Moby has to make remixes, and I do understand that every DJ has his own style. But in this case you don't hear anything new or different from what you heard on his old albums. Just recycling of old tricks.Save your money, wait for the next album."
3,No new breakthrough!! Too bad.,"Moby was obviously under a lot of pressure while making this album and it shows. He is afraid to step away from the formulawhich worked so well with ""Play"". On ""18"" most songs a so simplethat it becomes annoying. Most of the songs lack any interestingtransitions. Sound is basically the same on most of the album: strings, piano and simple vocal hook. This is it. ""Play"" was great because it such an eclectic collection of things. ""18"" is a essentially a one trick pony. If Moby had a goal in mind of licencing all the tracks from ""18"", he will probably do it.While I was listening to ""18"", I was constantly thinking that each track can be used for one sort of commercial or another.But more often than not music in commercials does not win any awards for creativity. If you want to listen to a true innovative music save yourself 18$ and put Moby's ""Play"" into your CD player. It is way beter album."
1,Disappointing,"All you folks who expect a moving trance beat will be sorely disppointed. I wanted to scream ""get on with it!"" It doesn't. However if you're wanting music to which to contemplate your navel, then go with this. It is guaranteed to put you to sleep. A real sorry purchase."
1,Moby and his 18 Failures,"Unfortunately, I must agree with part of Mr. Eminem's new lyric which berates Moby's ability to create music. I found 18 to be quite horrible and I suppose we shall be haunted by these tracks for many months to come with car companies scrambling to scoop up the hottest pop-techno tracks. I desperately want my money back for this CD. Furthermore, I will not join in this pitiful jubilee of kissing Moby's behind. I honestly do not care if he is supposed to be this great DJ/Producer. There just isn't any talent there. The man layed some new, yet very simple monotone rhythms over old soul songs. I like to dream of a world where music is somewhat original. Rob Dougan has a CD coming out that is phenomenal and original. St. Germain is original and worth buying. Let them cast me down for my slanderous speech here, but I think Moby's glory days have long since faded into the background of American pop music."
1,We are all made of 1 star.,"Uggh. When will you all wake up and realize this person is a hack? Am I the only one who notices that Moby's primary songwriting technique is stitching a few paltry loops together and playing them OVER and OVER and OVER until the listener wants to scream? It's pathetic, especially when there are so many artists out there with actual talent who are starving while this moron is raking in the bucks like there's no tomorrow. Wise up. Pull your heads out. Stop and think for a minute and see if you can actually think up two or three concrete reasons why you really ""like"" this drivel. Moby is garbage."
1,Keep your pillow close,"18 is a complete 180 from Play. Where Play kept you on your toes, 18 will barely keep you on your feet. Most of the CD is ambient filler with monotone vocals. Gone are the body rockin' beats and groves that kept Play alive and the listener glued. Track 9 was the only one that was palatable. 18 is a big disappointment for Moby fans. Every song on Play was an individual creation. The only way to tell if your listening to a different track on 18 is when your CD player differentiates it. I think that Eminm has it right when he said that Moby is done. If you like your beats consistent and repetitive this is the CD for you. It is not for me..."
2,something missing,"I enjoyed Moby's Play, but this album was boring. It feels empty, like nothing is really driving it. I gave it away to a friend who likes Moby, and soon they too found little reason to listen to it. Unfortunate...."
4,Avant-Garde to Old-Hat,"In these days of accelarated time, one can go from avant-garde to old-hat in the blink of an eye. The most famous and commercially successful ( and we mean that literally, as half the cuts from his last cd, ""Play"" became, in fact commercials) music collagist in the business has done a brilliant job virtually recreating the sound and feel of that album. The music here, like that of its predecessor, is rooted firmly in deep soul and gospel. Moby records some of his singers live while exhuming others buried in the vaults. Add his tinkling piano and lush orchestral arrangements and we have the ingredients for another deliciously satisfying, if no longer innovative, platter."
2,Too Loud,"The volume is way too loud on this, nor does it work right when you point the arrow to the specific animals. It works as a distraction during diaper time, but other than that, it's just way too obnoxious."
5,"gret voices, great stories","My children enjoy listening to a story, poem or two during lunch and on car rides. We especially like ""The Selfish Giant"" by Oscar Wilde and the selection from ""A Christmas Carol"" by Dickens. I am definatly going to invest in the first volume! These stories are entertainng and educational in a way no lecture on virtue can ever be."
3,The Link between Myth and Reality,"In this volume, Herodotus tells the histories of Greece and the surrounding areas. He provides a nice bridge from the ancient Greek myths unto the reality of what actually took place. He dispels myths where they seem absurd and tries to surmise the origins of others. Herodotus does a good job telling the customs and habits of the people he has observed. I give it 3 stars because with all the different names it is difficult to follow at times but the stories are very good."
2,sadly if youre reading this...,you are the owner of a D-1 diatom filter.aside from the filter leaking and being poorly designed these bags are a pain to change/clean and pretty expensive to replace.it does what its supposed to but honnestly i dont think its worth more than 3$
3,Good Stuff From Robust And Prolyphic {3.5 Stars},"Stick Figure emcees Robust and Prolyphic utilize a style that is similar to rappers of the early nineties. The production is minimal with its sparse drum loops and horn breaks. If there's a flaw on this album it's the fact that some of the production can drag on and makes some of the songs a chore to listen to. Lyrically, Stick Figures bounce from topic to topic. Every now and then they tend to go off on a tangent, but those kinds of mishaps are kept to a minimum. Though the production doesn't shift gears that often, there are still enough standouts on this album to make owning it a good idea."
4,Sick album - Robust and Prolific,"They dont have too much info on this album so I thought I would help some people out with a review. The group consists of Robust and Prolific, 2 underground rappers. You may have heard Robust on Sage Francis Still sick urine trouble, the shortneck girraff track near the end of the CD and he was also on Qwel - If it aint been in a pawnshop, tracks Art of War and $19.99 A.D. the best 2 tracks on the CD. Prolific is on Robusts album Potholes in our Molecules, a pretty good album in itself. Anyway the beats on this are nice they sound like circa 1993-1995 style and both emcees are nasty. I highly reccomend this CD if your a fan of indy hip hop."
1,Don't even Bother,This is a Waste of Film.it almost's tarnishes the Original.After the First one the Producers&What not should have let well enough be instead of trying too milk another one out.Very Boring&Directionless.Avoid it.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book last winter, hoping it would provide additional valuable insight into ways to differentiate within my 5th Grade classroom. I was sorely disappointed, however. I found the book to only ""skim the surface"" of the entire concept of differentiation in general. It was more of a broad-based introduction for a new teacher, rather than a valuable reference tool."
5,One of my favorite chaplin boxed collections,"Charlie Chaplin is my favorite actor. This is a collection of Chaplin Mutuals and Essanys. The movies are greatly restored and as hullarius as ever. My favorite movie on the collection is easily The Cure which had me and my friend cracking up. The other movies are great too. The only bad parts about them are that some of the movies are color tinted it looks bad but you can still see. Another bad thing is the music isn't the same the music is still really good but nothing can beat Chaplins original music. So what are you waiting for order this collection today if you are a true Chaplin fan or if you are a moviegoer heck, get it whoever you are!"
4,Not All the Greatest,"Even though this particular release does not contain all of their top hits it isn't a bad collection. My favorite Shalamar hit is Over and Over so I'm cool with this one, it's not the best assemblage but not the worst either."
2,Disappointed,Video clip can be found online so not an exclusive item or anything special. Don't bother viewing this even if it is free.
4,Very enjoyable Movie,Ordered this to give as a gift and it arrived in plenty of time. Very good movie and liked having three sources to watch it.
3,Kind of interesting,But only kind of. Thank goodness it was free. I thought it might add something to the movie but it didn't for me.
3,less than you expect,Fine for devoted fans. Not much time invested for others. But not really much insight. Each person in turn says how great it was. Not much more.
2,"Leave It To God is a Pamphlet, not a Book","Although I have read several of Christian Larson's books and found them to be both extremely interesting and somewhat repetitive, the ""book"" entitled ""Leave It To God"" is not only repetitive in the extreme, it is also very short text-wise. Thirty pages printed with 3"" by 4.5"" of typescript does not make for a thorough explication of the main thesis.However, that being said, perhaps the book would be more meaningful to some people. I just wanted a fuller explanation and guide--but I probably should have researched how many pages the item was before I ordered it--caveat emptor--as always.I recommend that one read the title and meditate on what that means and save a few dollars. Other books by Christian Larson would be a much more worthwhile read, but if a person needs to have everything he's written, I suppose purchasing this pamphlet/book would make sense."
5,Leave It to God,"The author, Christian D. Larson, was key in launching the New Thought movement in America. His writings are stunning, filled with metaphysical truths and practical advice.LEAVE IT TO GOD (1940) moves you through all kinds of personal experiences that beg you to do just that, with answers that follow mightily.I have been practicing this approach to life, and amazing events have occurred...like magic. A heavy weight of responsibility has been lifted from my shoulders; positive results guaranteed. If you don't believe me, try it for yourself!"
5,works great,This lantern works just as advertised. It puts out more then enough light when we eat dinner at night outside. It's not to expensive either.
5,Great for the kids,"I listened to these cd's as a teenager and fell in love with them. When they came out on cd I just had to have them for myself.These cd's are a great way to learn about some history, if you do not have time to read. A great listen for road trips, or even for your child to listen to.These cd's put real life events into a dramatic listen, easy for your kids to keep entertained while learning something."
1,Lightweight and patronizing,"""Mankind's Search for God"" purports to be an easy-to-read survey of the world's religions - and so it is, but it displays a very shallow understanding. Furthermore, every religion but the publishers' - that of Jehovah's Witnesses - is subtly ridiculed. This is lightweight propaganda, a little more articulate than Reader's Digest, yet more biased than the World Book Encyclopedia. For the same mental energy you could read ""The World's Religions"" by Huston Smith and come away with informed RESPECT for your neighbors' beliefs."
5,"I love this book! -Don't pay for it online, though.","If you want a history of religion that traces back to Babylon here it is. Also, it's easy to understand. But don't buy it online.Jehovah's Witnesses do not solicit money."
1,Biased view of other religions.,It is quick to point out the errors & so called false teachings of other religions. While touting it's own vertues. An example of religious intolerance. On the other hand it's fasinating to read how the witnesses view other religions. There are other books out there that do a better job of covering the worlds religions & from a more positive viewpoint.
3,For the Jung at heart,"This book is probably a great book if you view life from the Jungian perspective, and is as much a book about the Jungian approach as it is about hypnosis. It is not a how to do it book by any means, but designed to allow those with Jung's leanings to make use of hypnosis. Very few Jungian hypnotherapists exist, and in that sense the book is great as it opens up a new avenue for those with a mindset that didn't allow for use of hypnosis. But for others it may be a disappointment. Not an easy read, it requires a basic knowledge of the Jungian perspective to understand. If you don't have that, read some Jung first, and then the book will be more meaningful and useful."
4,"Bought for a project, not used yet","The quality of the replacement sponge seems very good: dense but lightweight.It is quite big, so check your dimensions first.I didn't use it yet, but I'm confident that will work for my purpose. And the price was great."
2,margin is black marks,I don't like it. The margin has black marks and water damaged. There is red marks on the back too.
1,75 Arguments Book,"The book was told to be ""used-very good"". The description said it was used but in nice shape with normal surface and edge wear with fast shipping. But the book I received was the opposite of the description. The book is barely ACCEPTABLE condition. There is major wear to the front cover, it is starting to peel apart, and there is also something on the cover. I am unsure what it is but it black and there are a lot of bent pages, including the cover. Next time you describe a product, describe it correctly how it looks, don't make it sound better so you can sell a product!!!!!"
5,The very best!,"This is an awesome collection from the most popular Italian singer. From the early 60s to today, this compilation will give you a very good panorama of this amazing performer.A must have!"
5,sexiest,"This is the very best of all the Hooters girls, and I think they're the sexiest of any group. They have beautiful faces and stunning figures. They're trained to be personable in their jobs, and that comes through. They're not rail-thin like the supermodels. They're not the airbrushed types like Playboy. They don't come across phony and stiff like those from the traditional pageants. Or sleazy like those from porno. I'm just really impressed with the Hooters girls, and every year it gets better. Nope, I don't have any connection to Hooters. Just a fan."
4,Cute but not smart,"First of all, the colors of this chart are not what they appear in the picture - they are way lighter and match the snoopy peek a boo theme very nicely. I don't think you'll be hanging this on the hooks provided at the back - that wont hold the chart securely and your baby (once he/she can get around) will easily knock it down. I had to use 3 nails (top, bottom and middle) to attach it to the wall, and while doing that one snoopy came off, had to glue it back on. Other than that, the chart is adorable!"
5,What a wonderful book!,"I loved this book because it took me on a journey to a part of the United States that is not known to most readers. And to a time that is not today. And to know people who are unlike any neighbors I have ever had.I really enjoyed learning the landscape and the problems and the social activities of mountain people. Someone who lives in an urban area (or the suburbs of an urban area) may feel superior to these characters, feel privileged compared to such country types but I really admired many of the people for coping so well with their circumstances. Many seem heroic, even.I'd like to say Thank You to this author!"
5,Plain and Simply,"one of the best collections of stories of life, love and the pursuit of happiness.... plain and simple. a ton of memories of my childhood came flooding back into my mind, growing up in Kentucky and cherishing all those great things that made me who i've become. you will laugh, you will cry... very good book."
5,"Finally, a FUNNY and smart book for two about eating and body image","I laughed so much I almost forgot I was getting really good ideas about how to teach my husband to talk to me about being chubby and all my food and diet ""stuff"" . I think if he reads this he might be able to be helpful, instead of infuriating. Anyway, fabulous book, right on the mark and written in small, readable chunks if you are busy."
2,"Basics, but not much depth","I bought this book when looking for information about eating disorders and marriage. I was disappointed because it seemed to be quite superficial and not very helpful at getting at the real issues. The other reviews here indicate that it was helpful to some people, and I'm glad for them. For me, it was not enough."
3,Didn't work for me,This item is for Collie type coats. It is too big for cats with plush coats and English Setters.
3,Light on specifics,"This DVD provides lots of material illustrating many different mountain biking activities and techniques; however, it gives very little in the way of specific instructions. It's better for showing what's possible than for explaining how to perform the various skills. As such, it's probably better for riders who have lots of time to experiment than for those wanting something more along the lines of a lesson."
1,Not worth the price,Bought this as a gift for my husband who is an avid mountain biker. Most of the techniques are described very quickly by Aussies with very heavy accents. It's impossible to understand more than a word here and there. The techniques they demonstrate are done as a one time run through with the indecipherable expert talks you through it. We got very little useful info from it.
2,More Fun to Make than Watch,I was really looking for some instruction to take my mountain biking from beginner/intermediate skills to intermediate/advanced. This video was no help to me. They quickly covered some fairly advanced skills with very little details or discriptions before moving to the next. To me it seemed like a group of cool guys who are awesome mountain bikers decided to throw this video together because there is nothing else out there like it. So it seems like someone could come along and really build on this first try. It's not something I would recommend.
4,Good review of Mountain biking skills,"While race oriented, this DVD is a good review of all the techniques necessary to advance in the sport of mountain biking. Watched in order the clips build on each other and show you how to do each technique. Yet each clip is independently selectable.There are also sections on bike building and maintainance.This DVD is produced in England so American viewers may find some of the language unusual but understandable.I like the video and it passes the basic test in that after watching you want to get the bike out and practice."
2,Don't expect too much...,"I'm one of those riders who is Intermediate/Advanced... and this DVD came on both a magazine recommendation and a friends' recommendation. I watched it. While it's cool to see some of the things, I yawned at the end, frustrated that I could already do 95% of what was described in the video. I was hoping to up my skills/techniques a bit, so it didn't help me there. one thing I *was* looking for was detailed guidance on riding a long-distance manual. That portion lasted for maybe a minute, and didn't tell me anything I didn't know. Fortunately, I also sponsor a school-based mountian bike club, so I will be able to use this for my students in the club, but for even the Intermediate rider, I'd say you're better suited to hang out with riders a little better than you and watch and learn them. Heck, offer to buy them a beer afterwards if they give you a ""how to"" ride... you'll make new friends, have a better time, and maybe even save a few bucks."
3,"GoOd info, bad format","I love the video, but it only plays on my laptop. It is not formatted to play on my DVD player or on my PS3."
3,"Rambles on a bit, but has useful info.","This video was worth the price just to learn the value of ""pre-jumping."" I thought bunny hopping was for kids doing tricks, not for serious trail riding to avoid all sorts of problems.Having had a downhill lesson now, it makes me wonder why they don't cover ""extending"" or ""manualling"" off of drop-offs. This is an important technique that I don't think the video covered.In any case, it was still informative. Not concise, but informative."
3,A pleasant way to spend an evening,"On the face of the Earth only the Barrenland remained an impenetrable mystery...a blasted radioactive area the size of a small state where no man dared to venture. But Jervis Yanderman was one of the more courageous souls of that future day when men at last were starting to reconstruct the vanished civilization of the dim past. Jervis knew that the secret of the Barrenland had to be solved, for THINGS from out of this world still emerged from it to terrorize neighboring lands. Living within the Barrenland, a desperate group of humans is trying to survive and to solve the mystery of an insane computer mind."
4,Great cutters - With one exception,"I would have given these cutters a 5 because they are durable and sharp. I use these for making cables and jewelry and they work great for both.The only thing I didn't like about them is they have a small piece of metal that sits on top of the cutting area that is used to that the blades don't actually meet face to face, thus keeping them sharper longer. I didn't even realize it belonged on there until I read the instructions. Anyway this piece tends to work itself loose and pop off of the cutter sometimes. Other than that these are sturdy, sharp and easy to handle."
4,Jewish Political Tradition Volume 1 - Authority,"This book asks a question in its Introduction setting the tone for the rest of the work: ""What structure of human authority is required by divine and textual authority?"" If that were the only sentence in the book, it would be worth reading.For any reader either Jewish, Christian or Moslem, this book is valuable because it teases from Scripture and history a sense of how humans choose to build governmental and judicial systems in response to what they perceive as being mandated or implied as mandated by divine writ; and how opposing voices test those choices of direction.One words repeatedly comes to mind as I seek to convey a sense of this book's contribution to thought: valuable."
4,Muy diferente y bueno,"Si te gusta el pop y la musica flamenca aqui tienes una perfecta combinacion . Estopa es mas que una banda de fusion, es una banda que integra various elementos para construir algo distinto, con un sabor unico de Iberica. Para mi me recuerdo de otro banda que tuvo exito hace anos que se llamaba Dire Straits. Si se te hace raro la comparison dejame explicar. Tienen un sonido que es similar, estilo muy ondo pero sencillo, casi como del campo, como estilo ""country"" a veces, pero siempre con alegria. Las guitarras tambien tienen ese estilo que corta como un cuchillo. Escucha el ejemplo ""Vino Tinto"" y posible me intiendes o puedes escuchar los refranes de Mark Knoppler. El voz de el cantante tiene calidad y madura para ser tan joven, puede ser que las experiensas de la vida salen en cancion. Esta es la musica de pachanga, que viva el espirito de los gitanos en su nueva forma de pop. La musica de la juventud de Espana para todo el mundo."
4,Excellent!,"Not too crazy about 2 or 3 songs in particular Jardin del Olvido and Ke Pasa, appears as if they ran out of ideas with those two but over all the rest of the album is great."
2,Terrific music but lousy singing,"I listened to this CD for the first time a few days ago. I loved the music and the instrumental rhythms were fantastic. HOWEVER, the singing was awful and amateurish and a terrible disappointment. Because of that I don't think I will listen to this CD again. If the singer(s) were replaced it would be a wonderful album. I'm just so surprised that the singer has the audacity to sing in public and apparently get away with it."
1,Pointless Garbage,"Want to see a better French lesbian vampire film? Check out ""Girl Slaves of Morgana Le Fay."" These three films were a waist of film, the direction was horrible, there was no redeeming qualities to the films. There are so many better vampire films out there."
4,The Roman Cavalry From the First to the Third Century A.D.,"Basically, I like this book. It is quite similiar to ""The Roman Soldier"" by G.R. Watson. It moves along very well without becoming tedious, as many other books of this type can. The author covers many subjects pertaining to the Roman cavalry itself, like unit organization and equipment. But, also covers the life of the individual soldier. From recruitment, training, and conditions of service, to how the cavalry was deployed in combat. The author also makes a number of comparisons between the cavalryman and the infantryman of the Roman Legion. This book has taken a subject that has been poorly covered in the past and made it very readable. I highly recommend it."
5,The Best of Laura Lee lives up to it's value for fans of this artist.,I enjoyed songs by Laura Lee in the 70's and her music is classic and enjoyable by her fans. It brought back many good memories of the past and will not dissapoint her avid fans.
3,"Sweeping, engrossing, but not enough insight on private life","Sherman is an intrinsically interesting character. Extremely bright but temperamental; either reviled or revered. A racist who did more to help blacks in that period than almost anyone else. You can't lose with a book on Sherman. However, the book left me confused about aspects of Sherman's personal life, which Mr. Marszalek treats too gingerly. Mrs. Sherman seems to be an absolute horror: she nags him constantly to become a Catholic; she refuses to leave her father; when she goes to Sherman's post, she leave a child behind to make sure that they will have to return to Dad. The military details are all there, and some insight into Sherman's breakdown, but that need to cling to a nagging woman is not explained. However, it's a good read, and good history. (Alan J. Jacobs"
1,Sherman a glorified war criminal,"Sherman made war on women and children. He had his troops burned houses to the ground, turned a blind eye to the looting his men did, burned crops to the ground, destroyed any livestock he couldn't use and left the civilian population to starve to death everywhere he went in the South.Sherman had town halls burned so there were no accruate records as to how large the population of the town he burned was. Sherman also removed large numbers of civilians (women and children)who worked at the New Manchester and Roswell, Georgia Mills, North; where many of them died of exposure or starvation. On the trip North many of these New Manchester, Roswell, Georgia Mill women workers were raped.I am not a sympathizer for the Southern Cause during the American Civil War. However, I do believe that Sherman is a war criminal and shouldn't be idolized which this book does."
2,Misleading advertising,"I bought this CD because the ads (here on amazon.com) compared it to Tim Story, one of my favorites. While there are some basic similarities in genre, I find that Pearce's style is less evocative and more drone-like. I expected Pearce to be different, and found him to be boring."
2,Old Standby Disappoints,"I have used a similar Fiskars model for various household and classroom purposes for years, but after buying this class pack to supply my Montessori classroom I am disappointed. The handles are loosely bonded to the blades so that the tips do not always meet fully. This is frustrating for young scissor apprentices as well as for more experienced users.That said, I have not found a better model at this price. Also, the handles are nearly a perfect size and shape, so I would hesitate to recommend another pair. I would just like to see a better quality build from Fiskars."
3,Some Good Ideas,"This book has some usable ideas, but I found it difficult to envision adapting it to MY situation as a 7th and 8th grade English teacher. It sat, unused on my shelf for over a year. Having just taken an eight hour training from Ledbetter, I now have a clearer picture of what she does than I was able to glean from her book. This volume is a collection of activities and aproaches from her practice, and not a complete""writing curriculum,"" as the cover suggests. If you want some ideas, it is a good but expensive place to graze."
4,Overview With Good Descriptions,"This book is a good intro to biochemistry and I used it as a jumping off point for some studies in protenomics and genetic studies.The nature of the text assumes a solid foundation in about 2nd year biochemistry with core studies in concepts, but there are is a lot of other interesting side bars and concepts (the section on DNA Probes being especially good).I do not have a 2nd year Biochem background, but where I was lost I was able to bone up and then attack the text in a relatively easy manner. For hardcore students and upper level biochem professionals it may only serve as an overview. For those with lower needs it can still help in many ways and the stylistic presentation helps in understanding quickly with a minimum of effort."
4,read for boards,"i read this for the boards(step1). It is readable with nice tables and diagrams that compliment it. you may not have time to read it, but if you have time, pls read this book for step 1. You should also read it during course work, then when the step 1 comes along it should be easier to read. i wish i read it during course work, but i read it for my step 1 and i made a 229/95"
4,The Newest and Best Edition,"I have used all three of the editions of thisbook in my classes. By far the best review text, the addition of color illustrations adds greatly to the conciseness of the text. Color certainly helps me remember things a bit better, as I have a visual memory. A good study aid and USMLE prep book."
4,well drawn diagrams of reaction pathways,"The word ""Illustrated"" in the title is crucial in describing the efficacy of this book. The subject of biochemistry is very complicated, with intricate molecular processes. A strict textual description of the material is not sufficient. It is greatly supplemented by well drawn colour diagrams that indicate the reaction pathways and mechanisms.These should help you review the material. And it should be mostly review for you. The book could be used by a reader as a first text on its subject. But its terseness may make that difficult for many. Instead, you should have another text (or texts) that you have already gone through, which explained the material at a slower pace."
5,Clinically oriented,"This book is very good about applying biochemistry to clinical settings. It is very easy to read also. Although sufficient for my biochem class, it may not get deep enough for other biochem classes. If you are in a master's program for biochem it probably isn't sufficient."
1,Rusted already,"I've had it for less than a month and it has already begun to rustps: complained to Amazon, returned it, and the new one also has rusted badly. I know this is not made of stainless steel, but come on!"
1,once was enough,The book was not interesting at all. It was more of a collection of essays to be sumbitted on a high school level.
5,Awesome Saw!,"I have several other LXT tools, so the battery and charger are compatable. I was a little worried about buying a cordless saw, but after using it for a few days, I couldn't be happier.The headlight feature is very useful, I am glad a spent the extra money for this model.The 1.5 LXT batteries will fit (with some effort), however this saw was designed for the 3.0 batteries, they slide on perfectly.Good Luck!Update- 12/29/2010Still going strong- and I am still very pleased overall. A fresh blade goes a long way to maximizing the cutting power and battery life."
5,Mi hermano menor se fue al borde de,"la ruina: Tenía un negocito próspero y todo iba super bien , cuando una mañana ya casi no pudo levantarse... Una semana después, mi cuñada lo llevo al siquiatra, que dijo que estaba deprimido y le mandó Seropram..Pero Hugo seguía igual, y trató de suicidarse.¡No hay mal que por bien no venga !En Emergencias lo atendieron y mientras estaba en el hospital, le descubrieron la Fagiga Crónica..Es muy importante leer este libro para poder identificarla y combatirla antes que las cosas pasen a mayores..."
5,¡QUÉ VIRUS TAN TERRIBLE Y TAN TRAIDOR!,"NO NOS QUITA LA VIDA...PERO NOS CHUPA COMO UNA SANGUIJUELA LA ALEGRÍA DE VIVIR, LAS METAS, LAS ILUSIONES !Lo grave es que ( por eso lo llamo traidor ) penetra en tu cuerpo y hace daño poco a poco, hasta que te derrumba...sin motivo aparente...ES VITAL LEER ESTE LIBRO INFORMATIVO QUE TE DA LOS CAMINOS PARA IDENTIFICARLO Y COMBATIRLO !!"
4,great little speakers,"I bought these speakers for my office because the sound quality of laptops is like listening to an am station under a bridge. Pretty good little sepakers. I really like them because the volume can go super low, which I need during the day, and on the weekends I jam out with loud volume."
1,Stay away from these.,"I'm not an audiophile, just a plain ole' guy that likes quality. These speakers leave a lot to be desired. Not only do they sound like tin, but they ""skip a beat"" every minute or so. At first, I thought it was my sound card (a Creative product, too.), but I went to W**mart and bought a $10.00 set, and they work and sound great."
4,amazing little speakers!,"these speakers are wonderful! and adorable! my only gripe is that they're fairly lightweight and if the sound is up loud, they tend to rumble right off my shelf. and although i do wish they went a little louder, they're pretty stellar for the size and price."
5,"With simple, exciting color artwork","Iguanas In The Snow And Other Winter Poems is an impressively presented bilingual children's picturebook in English and Spanish. Each two-page spread features a different free-verse poem in both languages by Francisco Z. Alarcon, and is jubilantly illustrated by Maya Christina Gonzalez with simple, exciting color artwork. Iguanas In The Snow/Iguanas en la Nieve is especially recommended for young people learning to read in both the English and Spanish languages."
4,Where's the Iguana?,"Iguanas in the Snow is a great bi-lingual poetry book. Francisco makes you feel like you are on the California coast, enjoying Pier 39. The illustrations are so realistic. I lived in California for a year and have gone to San Francisco many times; the colored houses are spot on, as well as the seals at the Pier.After feeling the breeze of the coast, Francisco takes you into a world full of white. The poetry and illustrations make you want to put out your tongue and wait for the snow to land on your tongue. The section on snow would be great to read to kids who live in an area which it does not snow.My favorite thing about this book is the Iguana which is hiding on each page."
2,Too clever for its own good,"At no point during this album's conception did they sit down and make a conscious decision on its style. What we get is something of an art-rock muddle. NO Distance Left To Run is an achingly beautiful lament, Mellow song doing that style reasonably as well. Swamp Song (no relation of the Oasis track) is instantly appealing but soon fades, so does B.L.U.R.E.M.I. with its lazy retread of Song 2, via Devo. Coffee and TV is the only thing resenbling a britpop song, though I never liked that BLur phase much anyway. Much takd of tracks like Bugman and Trimm Trabb go on too long, with the nosie solo no Bugamn souring an otherwise strong track. Most of the tracks I haven't mentioned border on the unlistenable."
1,Noise Noise Noise,"I am an ex-Blur fan. Yes, I emphasize on the EX. The likely lads have obviously decided to ""move on"" to a new sound - they call it rock. Maybe it's so they can appeal to the American market, but to me it's a sad waste of what used to be superb stuff. The sound of <Parklife> and <The Great Escape> were fab, songs which everyone could sing along to. That's why there were masterpeices. Can't say the same for <blur> and <13>. Get back to your parklife mates!"
3,Average. Better things have already been done.,"Following the ""Growing Up"" trend that most big pop bands seem to be taking these days, Blur deliver a sixth album that is their most dark and subtle to date. Frankly, this was a suprise coming from a band made famous for light-hearted pop music tunes like ""Girls & Boys"" and ""Charmless Man"".Some of the songs are good, like ""Tender"" and ""B.L.U.R.E.M.I."", but some of the songs are totally unlistenable, ""Bugman"" in particular. And the rest of the album is full of second rate pop tunes that have none of the energy that made Blur so much fun to listen to.As a whole, this album is okay, nothing special, and nothing like what I expected (and what I was hoping for)."
2,The Emporer Has No Clothes,"What are Coxon and Albarn thinking? I'm all for the band evolving beyond their unhealthy middle-class image; however, this album just doesn't do them justice. While I thank them for excluding a seemingly obligatory mindless remake of Song 2, that's about where the compliments end. And I had such high hopes. Nearly every other album has been stellar and the first two tracks here were quite good.I can only see things getting better if the band chooses someone else to do the producing. Honestly, whose idea was it to hire a guy whose greatest claim to fame is producing a Madonna album? Willaim Orbit has some serious explaining to do.This album almost snuck by me as there was very little excitement in the press over this title. I can understand the apathy.It would seem that Parklife is as good as it gets."
2,One Good Song,"One good song is about all there is to the new Blur cd. Sorry guys. But I want to hear music when I play a cd not a bunch of static, and sounds like an interference from some sort of machinery. Very noisey, and should be better as talented as these guys are."
5,Buy this now...,"Blur sets the standard again...Tender you've heard, full of soul, Bugman rocks out...Coffee & TV is truely fantastic...Swamp Song is like a walk through a huanted house...1992 grows on you...Battle is a cool little mellow number which leads nicely into Mellow Song where you'll sing along...Trailer Park has song great hooks, Caramel is sweet to the taste, Trimm Trabb is one of the top choices on the album..No Distance is sad little ballad, and Optigan 1 is an instrumental...you're best off hitting play and starting it all over again...it gets better and better with each listen..."
4,blur at their best,"I bought this cd right after it came out becasue I fell in love with Tender. I was a bit afraid if it would be the only good song on the album but fortunately it wasn't. The album is not brilliant but it's very, very good. I think that except the Optigan 1 and Bugman (that are in my opinion the weakest on the album) all the other songs are very good, especially Tender, Coffee&TV and No Distance Left To Run which is my all time Blur favorite...Of course big deal goes to William Orbit who have proved once again that he's very talented and interesting producer."
1,Do These Guys Listen What They're Doing?,"Being a casual Blur fan, I've enjoyed ""Modern Life Is Rubbish"", ""Parklife"" and the self-titled ""Blur"". These cd's stand and deliver with their extreme pop sensiblilities w/ mucho attitude. I feel like I'm actually in England while I listen to these chaps. But what the heck is ""13""! These songs sound to me like half concocted riffs they wrote while stoned and figured, ""yea this'll blow their minds"". I mean this is not a good cd compared to their previous works, it doesn't sound like they ever finished it. Just my .02 pence."
1,... And that's being generous !,"Anybody who gave this album more than 1 star is ""acoustically-challenged"" in a very big way. There isn't a single lick or line - let alone song - that is worthy of mention on what must surely be the crappiest album ever, but I mean *ever*, made."
1,This CD Apesta !!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't Buy This CD For Any Reason Is a Piece of sweepings Only The Song ""Tender"" Could Be Listen and it`s Not The Big Deal. Don`t Waste Your Money And Your Time Please."
3,"Worthwhile, but perhaps for fans only","Despite an abundance of abstract, richly-textured rock songs, '13' feels unsatisfying. Thanks to the production genius of William Orbit, the record is very cohesive but at the same time strange & difficult. And the sing-along singles ""Coffee & TV"" and ""Tender"" don't justify what the album is about. Their earlier stuff is much cooler."
5,nice mtv-clip of coffee and tv,"Yes, I admit I wasn't of this world, because I had never heard of them, until this terrific clip,. After seeing the clip I've bought all the cd's and it wont dissapoint you!"
5,Just for grown ups,"Well I cannot say anything that would not repeat what others have said. Some people compared this to O.K. Computer and to a certain extent I must agree. Yet unlike Radiohead's effort this album does not amalgamate itself in the mood it tries to convey. Also some tracks could have been shorter. As to the people who do not like this music......well this is music for grown ups. Get used to it cause it is also the way foward sonically,"
5,The best ever,this is simply the best record ever. the more u listen the more ull like it. and this will go on for everonya blur!
5,The best Blur album till now,"You will find in this CD the best work that blur has done till now - and I hope there's still more to come -. You can find all kind of music genres here: from punk like ""B.L.U.R.E.M.I."" to rock tunes - Bugman - ballads - 1992, No distance left to run- and one of the best songs I've ever heard from the Beatles era: ""Coffee and TV"". If you enjoy good music just buy this CD, you have no other choice, specially if you yearn the 60's sound"
3,Lets be honest,"Forget the extreme reactions. It's Ok; not a classic and certainly not bad. It's simply Ok. Just accept the moments of wonder that are here (""Trim Tram"", ""Tender"", ""No Distance Left To Run"")and make use of you Skip button on your CD for the dross.But, congratulations to them for doing just what the hell they want. Even if we don't like all the results, they are in a position where they should be pushing it's audiences conceptions. True, there's a lot of things here that are pretty poor: but come the release of new material I'll still be there buying (expecting) to be confused. That's their job. That's what musicians are supposed to do.There's too much mediocrity and uniformity in music as it is:Blur are trying to do something different. Are you with them or against them? Come on Come On Come On"
4,Climax to a band's evolution,"Simply the best! Detached from their former American album, in ""13"" Blur walk one more step towards their musical maturity. This album has been written by a broken-hearted man...is there any better mood than this for writing a master piece such as this? Cheers Damon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Unlucky Number,"While I don't like most of the ""songs"" on 13, I have to admit that it is a product of sheer genius. Despite their best efforts at intentionally destroying their image, they've succeeded. It was truly amazing to hear Song 2 (one of their worst) being used for an Intel Pentium II commercial.13 is probably the worst blur recording to date and includes the first un-spirational song ever written (Tender). Most of the noises on this CD cannot be considered as songs but as suicidal pastiches. But, there are some songs here which are ok: BLUREMI, Coffee & TV, and the annoyingly long Bugman.I'm waiting for the same blur that made Peter Panic, Mr. Robinson's Quango, or even Death of a Party. Hopefully, on their next release they'll try a bit harder.[DW]"
4,13LUR's twisted masterpiece,"the self titled Blur album, released before this ""13"" album, was hampered by a band struggling to break free of their established sound. they tried twiddling the knobs and turning on the effects with mixed results. the overall sound was a confused band trying to feel their way around experimental territory.now that they've worked out the kinks a bit more, they deliver this stunning collection of songs. the feeling is still confused and a bit lost, but that confused energy is well filtered into creating some great music full of twists and turns. a new style awaits around almost every corner. from the gospel inspired opener ""Tender,"" to the noise-soaked pop stylings of ""B.L.U.R.E.M.I."" and ""Bugman."" and this album contains some of their most raw ballads. you'll feel a lump in the throat while listening to ""No Distance Left to Run."" there's alot of stuff to absorb here on this sprawling disc. and repeated listens will reward the patient listener."
2,Unlucky #13,"Blur's latest is well, pants. Okay it's being hailed by the critics but that's only due to the shift in their music. They've evolved in a way that 'Old Blur' fans such as myself find difficult to adapt to. This simply isn't a patch on the last two albums (""The Great Escape"" and ""Blur""), the music is far too distorted and hard to even comprehend admiring. A couple of the songs do stand out, ""Coffee & T.V."" and ""B.L.U.R.E.M.I."" both see the boys back to their old selves.I'd recommend this to anyone that enjoyed Radiohead's ""OK Computer"" as it's in the same vein. I personally didn't like that one either and the sooner I flog ""13"" the better."
4,Grows on you,"Starting out as an alien, foreign-sounding album, it really grows on you.Give it a chance."
5,Best Blur album to date,"I have been a Blur fan since the beginning. My problem with Blur has always been with their album content. I always find myself in love with 3 or 4 songs on most albums and the rest is less than interesting. ""13"" is the first album since ""Leisure"" that I am totally happy with. It has some of their best songs ever. Track 7 is by far their coolest song. Props go out to William Orbit for making sense out of the chaos. Fortunately I won't have to worry about Blur getting overplayed since the mainstream doesn't know what to make of them."
3,Tracks 1 and 3 are great... but that's about it.,"I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed with this album... I loved the britpop sound of Coffee and TV, and Tender is a great track, but I honestly can't remember any of the other songs from the rest of the album, and I have given it a fair try. Be ready for something different if you've never listened to Blur before... or even if you have. My favorite Blur album is definetly ""Parklife""... and if you like Coffee and TV, I think you'll very much enjoy ""Parklife"" over ""13""."
4,"GETTING THERE, GETTING THERE","Coool bandmembers, cool songs, cool lyrics, everything on this album is just very, very cool. I'think its a great album from a great band so I think Damon and the others should continue in the same way. The good songs are: Tender*, Bugman*, Coffee and TV*, 1992*, caramel, Trimm Trabb* and Trailerpark. (The little stars stands for Really good song).Could there be another musical- genious like Thurston Moore in this world of MTV-music? probably not, but Graham and Damon is getting a little bit closer."
2,"too much noodling, not enough songs","somebody shoulda told damon albarn that an album ought not consist of 15 minutes' worth of songs surrounded by 45 minutes of instrumental filler. Sure, the songs -- especially ""tender"" and ""coffee and tv"" -- are brilliant, but they're undercut by the band's tedious ambient meanderings. damon needs to embrace his pop-songwriter side and stop trying to be thurston moore."
4,I love Damon Albarn,"First off, let me say that I would buy anything that has to do with Blur. I love them so much!! That said, this album has its flaws but is still enjoyable. ""Tender"" is just a lovely song about a broken heart and ""Coffee and TV"" is very modern and experimental. The rest of the album is somewhat mellow (As one of the song titles attests) It's still a worthwhile album though."
5,YUM,"Probably their best album to date. I got hooked in to Blur by their infectious pop melodies, melodies I was all too sure they would soon forget how to write. I could never have seen the turning into this. It is such a wonderful surprise."
2,"Expected better, more listenable music","I loved ""Blur"". I didn't expect or want a re-hash of ""Blur"", but I didn't expect this sonically disturbing release. I've listened to it about 20 times all the way through now and I think ""Tender"" is brilliant. I also enjoy ""Bugman"", ""Coffee & Tea"", and ""No Distance Left to Run"". I can't listen to much of the rest anymore. Sorry! :)"
3,"Nothing close to Park Life, Leisure or Blur","Upon first listening to Blur's latest, 13, I was taken aback. How could Damon do such a thing? Seven and a half minutes of sappy, boring gospel-tinged dreck called ""Tender."" This is by far the worst Blur song written. In '97, Blur entered the fray like men, ready to dispel all rumors of mediocrity. They hit stages all over the U.S., and blasted crowds with the intensity of ""Song 2,"" and the Beatlesque poesy of ""Beetlebum."" Now we're all stuck with Damon as he nurses his wounds. It's not like he doesn't have throngs of beautiful women, all very anxious to help him get over his recent breakup with Justine Frischmann. Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible record. ""Coffee&TV,"" and other tracks such as ""B.L.U.R.E.M.I."" are experimental and recall some of the ground-breaking stuff on Blur's last record. My advice--go buy Frank Black & The Catholics' Pistolero, or Leisure instead!"
5,Wow.,"This is an amazing album. When I first got it, I regretted the purchase (as is often the case with the stuff I come to really enjoy.) It was just.. too weird and disjointed. But somehow I forced myself to listen, and I became uh, seduced by all the weirdness. It's so unique. I haven't really ever heard anything like this album. It's like the guys took everything musical they could think of, mixed it up into a enormous blender, and threw in some extra parts for good measure. I hear electronica, metal, punk, indie, blues, hip hop, gospel (you knew I was gonna say it.) and god knows what else in it. It's psychedelic in an almost terrifying way, with all the varied textures. If you buy this album, be prepared to put some work into enjoying this. It's a freaky mutated evolution of rock.In my opinion, Blur and Radiohead have left everyone else in the rock world way behind. Or perhaps they've just moved away from it themselves. Who knows."
2,One of the most ruined albums ever,"With 13, Blur missed another opurtunity to make a great album which could be looked at as a masterpiece. The album has jewels here and there, and a great ending song (optigon 1) which show Blur as a band which wants to experiment. However, they betray themselves with songs such as Bugman and their other efforts seem to be made in vain. It reminds one that Blur is only another Pop band and a poor one at that .Blur's contmepararies from Britian do a good job of showing that Blur is a inferior band and that their music will not stand the test of time. The Verve, Radiohead, Pulp etc. all released masterpieces during the 1990's and Blur trailed behind, acting as a poor imitation.On your first few listens of 13, you may enjoy it, but it most likely wont last."
2,Not that substantial,"I was never much of a Blur fan, but this album intrigued me. And on first listen, I was sure I'd heard something great, one of the best albums of the year. But sadly it was just a ruse. The music on this album is formless and mostly uninspired feedback symphonies, with nothing else going on. It's not that innovative or original (for the real deal in feedback rock check out My Bloody Valentine's ""Loveless"", or even Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music"" for that matter), and after a few close listens, it ceases to be interesting or entertaining. It's just a muddled collage of feedback, trip-hop, and, every once in a while, some brit-pop and punk. Don't be fooled."
3,Disappointment,"I read reviews about this CD, and they all said it was great, their best album yet. I already had Parklife, and I liked it, so I thought I'd get 13 as well. I'm not saying it isn't good. But it's not as good as Parklife. It's a lot more confused, with a gospel-like opening song that's almost 8 minutes long, and then a lot of other songs that range between the known and loved britrock to something that sounds more like american punk-rock, and some nice quiet songs. And then there are those parts that follow some songs- after the song is over, but before the track is. Just short parts of music that has nothing to do with anything.So, basically, this has been quite a disappointment after what I expected it to be. Too bad."
1,"Hurts my ears, and not in a good way","I really liked Blur's last album, the self-titled one. So I got this new one right after it came out. I've listened to it about 5 times and I can't stand it. I find the songwriting really uninspired and the level of noise incredibly grating. I keep fast-forwarding to the next song about 2:30 into one song, hoping the next one will be better. But it's not. I'm giving up. Major disappointment."
4,beautiful,"This is an amazing soundtrack, a definite must-have if you're a fan of this Danny Boyle film or just a fan of film soundtracks in general. Some of the songs are very reminiscent of the style exhibited in the song ""Ice Dance"" in Danny Elfman's soundtrack to ""Edward Scissorhands"", another great soundtrack.It doesn't have ""Hysteria"" by Muse (you should have Muse's ""Absolution"" anyway) which is played during the train robbing scene. It has ""Blackout"" anyway, which, if you're more into a softer sound, you might like."
3,The way to remember a great movie,"This soundtrack makes it easy to get the feeling back you had when you left the theatre after seeing this movie. It's got a lot of the score by John Murphy, but also very good tracks by Muse and Feeder. The track that couldn't be missing on this album is El Bosco's Nirvana. It's the last track on the cd but the one you've been waiting for. It will give you back that positive feeling you had after seeing this great movie by Danny Boyle. This soundtrack is a good compilation of a great movie."
4,Millions of smiles,"I loved Millions. The movie of Angels and two small boys who find a million in British Pounds follow their own dreams in giving out the cash. The score is a perfect match of the feel of the film and it's nice to relive the emotion by playing the soundtrack. If you loved the movie, you'll love Millions musical score."
3,Not really a songbook!!,Wonderful to compile a history of Newfoundland songs and their origins BUT the title is misleading. It is NOT a book of songs to play on the piano. It is a book to read.....
2,rusty,"Rusted after first day of use. I hate rust. Guess it wasn't stainless steel, but besides that it does what its supposed to do."
3,Wilkie Collins' first novel of importance.,"Wilkie Collins' first two novels,ANTONINA and BASIL,while displaying his talent for melodrama were stylistically amateurish.While BASIL has attracted the attention in recent years of scholars and readers,HIDE AND SEEK,Collins' third and according to the author-his best work written up to that point,has engendered little comment. HIDE AND SEEK was a turning point for Collins.Though the book contained some of the insipid prose writing that fatally marred the first two fictions,HIDE AND SEEK was the work in which Collins' power emerged.It tells the story of the destructiveness of religious and sexual hypocrisy and the bitter hatred and revenge that they have inspired.With the mysterious American begins the first in a line of sinister yet sympathetic avengers found in Collins' work-most notably NO NAME and ARMADALE.Despite its unevenness,HIDE AND SEEK is Collins' first memorable work and hopefully will receive the notice it deserves."
1,Ridiculous plot,"This was such a bomb, I tossed it into the dumpster. Going by the author's reputation, I thought it would be good...it wasn't."
3,an enjoyable book,"I like the way Wilkie Collins writes, the particular flow of words, and ideas... This novel is about an affectionate husband with an invalid wife, and a deaf adoptive daughter...they were a happy family, in spite of their problems... that is a very important message. You always may be happy, no matter your problems, if you have a positive attitude in life, love and non attachment; there is also a young man, who wanted to follow his way in art, instead of doing his father will; the characters are well portrayed, very interesting book; I recommend it."
2,Illustrations are pathetic,"This may be a great story, but the illustrations are akin to something out of a public health brochure. It was a big disappointment."
5,"""Nothing But Velvet"" Is Nothing Short Of Perfection!","I absolutely loved this romance novel. It was the first romance novel I've read by Kat Martin, and now I own every book she's made as of yet. This story is about a stolen dukedom, and innocent maiden desperate for funds, and Jason Sinclair, the true ruler of the dukedom of Carlysle. He beings to fall in love with Velvet Moran, but refuses to do anything because he believes he has nothing to offer her. Full of chivalry and honesty. A truly wonderful read."
3,Mediocre,Not the greatest but what can you expect for the price. it does get the job done as a cheap day to day wheel.
3,they did it for the money,"sorry to say this is just an average cd.their last effort,roadhouse research,was excellent,probably their best.i bought it on past reputation but i was let down because i compared it to their last album ,which was a killer."
3,Track Listing,1. Take A Toke (The Album Version) 4:302. Take A Toke (Robi-Rob's JEEP Mix !) 7:133. Take A Toke (Robi-Rob's Hip Hop Junkies Mix) 6:214. Take A Toke (Take A Toke House Mix) 7:535. Take A Toke (Radio Version - Take It Slow) 4:376. Robi-Rob's Boriqua Anthem - 9:02
3,informative book,"Jenny Ward did a good job with this book. Since the subject is a very dry one, she added cases in which the forensic breakthroughs took place. The book gave lots of information on who, where, when, and how the breakthroughs were discovered. I am a junior studying criminology and criminal justice and was intrigued by this book. I feel that Ward gave me enough information to understand what occurs in these processes. I found the book rather interesting even though it is a dry subject."
2,Not so discreet faux piercing,"I wanted a fake piercing just to see if I would like the look of a real one without having to risk infections and stuff pertaining to having a hole in the flesh.It's cute but just not realistic due to the wire jutting out of the rose. Which sucks because that's what I was going for.However, I decided to get a real piercing, not because of the look of this product, but because of the look of a tiny metallic golden dot sticker that I took from my little cousin. Wish that I've done that sooner..."
3,"Nice knob for the money, feels great just know that the shift pattern is probably wrong","This is a nice quality knob, it installs easily and feels great. Just be sure to notice it has a racing h-pattern on it. I failed to look closely at it when ordering."
4,The only book that gave me hope that I might be happy again.,"My husband and best friend died unexpectedly 4 months ago. He was 33. Ours had been a stormy and volatile relationship. After he died I found out things about him I really did not want to know. However I grieved and continue to grieve despite realising he had lied to me for the duration of our relationship. this book was the only one that addressed this issue. How do you go about grieving someone you loved deeply, but find out after their death that they were not the person you thought they were? Staudacher was not afraid to tackle this most painful situation and offer advice and support. For those who try and intelluctualise their way out of grief I recommend A Time To Grieve. My only criticism would be that it stresses 'forgiveness' too much. There are some that cannot be forgiven, in this life anyway."
4,Short passages,"I like the philosophy of short one page passages and thoughts, since I have a busy lifestyle. I pick up this book, before bed at night; during a break in mid day; or whenever I have a few free moments. Each page is written but a different person----some things apply to me, some don't, but it's easy to skip around. This book is not for someone looking for deep psychological help."
5,A lifesaver!,I found this book about four months after I lost a loved one to suicide and it was a lifesaver. It made me realize that what I was going through was normal and there were other people going through the same thing. I found the book very helpful and it gave me inspiration to go on. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has lost someone no matter what the cause of death was.
5,Grief is each Individual's Journey,"In a world where many times the entire grief process is misunderstood or blatantly ignored, this book is a cool oasis in a time of personal need. There were so many passages in this book that I could see myself going through as a widow. So many relevant points -- sometimes we try to push the grief away, to keeping insanely busy. . .Carol Staudacher urges those in grief to slow down and think about the loss, study it, let it come in so it can faced and a healing process can begin. It's certainly not easy, but better than avoiding the pain inside. We need to take ""emotional inventory"" so we can deal with our individual aspect of grief, realizing that our idea of normal will never be the same. Elaine Williams"
5,A Time to Grieve,"This was one of many books recommeded to us by Hospice for those who are grieving and have lost a loved one. It is excellent, and a book to keep nearby to pick up and read on any page and it is applicable to the reader.jm"
4,swingin'!!,"this is a pairing that makes perfect sense. mr. pizzarelli is the son of the patriarch of swing guitar, bucky pizzarelli, but is quickly becoming a powerhouse on guitar all his own. previous projects have shown him to be a musician of consummate skill who can swing just about tune into a bubbling fury of fun. he also has a tender touch with ballads. mr. shearing has been swinging for over 60 years and this project reveals he is still a master. this set mixes standards and originals and it all sounds fresh and exciting. check out ""lulu"" and ""everything happens to me"" and you will hear the great way these two artists mix and meld. this is an album worth hearing again and again!"
5,"Rare Delight, Indeed!","What a delight this combination is~~ George Shearing, who has the smoothest piano technique around is complemented perfectly by John Pizzarelli whose lyrical voice is so warm and seems to be directed to you! John's wonderful guitar work on the seven-string in duet with George's piano is a match made in jazz heaven. You can nearly hear the chuckling that must have accompanied this recording; both men are so charming! Highlights include LULU'S BACK IN TOWN, which I've always thought of as being in Mel Torme's domain, but is given a new fresh treatment here. Listen to SHINE ON YOUR SHOES and don't grin. I dare you :) Now ~~ where is the news of the tour?? =|="
4,I like this Cd,Very nice CD. He should be proud of this work. When in Vegas I saw him and Brian Evans and enjoyed them both. This CD is really nice.
5,excellant product,The drill bits were an excellant buy. Finding this size locally was difficult but Amazon had them.
1,there is a reason this single is one cent,"this is my review for the album:This is to elevating the fusion of jazz,turntable(ism),rap and rock (shlock) as Kid Rock (shlock) is to elevating the human race. Jack off all trades......master of wack"
1,Silence is better than this ambient sound,"I wanted to like this cd released on the Ancient Sun label, but it is just so lifeless and phony. It sounds like it was created in a day inside the living room of someone's house. I believe more effort was contributed to the new age song titles than to the music, which is dull and uninspired. The keyboards are awful and drone on like the sound of muted chalk scraping on a blackboard. I know I may sound harsh with this review, but seriously, it is just awful and done in a patronizing way that nobody should have to buy into this fluff."
4,Modernism?,"Mrs. Dalloway is one of the greatest of Modern texts. If the reader doesn't understand that this was written in a Modern (not contemporary btw)framework, then the reader will obviously not understand the literary merit of it. Modern texts are difficult to read, because it was a way for authors to break away from the complacency of late Romantic and Victorian literature. Just because a book is a little challenging, does not make it boring, and to say that the movie version was better because it was more organised, is falling very far into the trap of ""Hollywoodisation"". Be careful when you make claims of merit for one genre over another, you may discover that the ""popular"" one is so because it does not challenge, and only caters to a lazy audience."
1,horrible,"reader from ohio i agree totally with you. this book was not worthy of my time. i had the hardest time keeping up with the scenes, and the people. i must say the movie was a lot mor organized which then made it easier to understand the characters and theme of the book"
4,one of the best!,"HANSEL AND GRETEL is one of the best in the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series, with lush costume and set designs based on the classic storybook illustrations of Arthur Rackham.Young Hansel and Gretel (Rick Schroder and Bridgette Andersen) are abandoned in the forest by their cruel stepmother (Joan Collins). The children happen across a magical cottage entirely made of gingerbread and sweets, which is owned by an evil witch...Joan Collins plays the dual-roles of the stepmother and the witch, and gives a fantastic performance as both characters. Paul Dooley plays the children's well-meaning father.One of the best of FAERIE TALE THEATRE's earlier episodes."
1,Body Pump anyone?,"I love Cathe but I returned this DVD, because it was just too similar to body pump. I didn't love it."
