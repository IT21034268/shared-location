3,Material lloks cheap,The fit and workmanship were as I expected but the synthetic material on the exterior looked cheap. I sent them back.
2,No more American shoe sizes?,"What's up? It seems that our wide foot sizes are no longer being made in that these shoes were made in an Asian nation, not recalling just which one right now. Hence, my size B width is no longer available. I know I can get around this by ordering a longer shoe but who wants to have large-looking feet? I tried at the department store, too, and they only make N (narrow) and M (medium) widths in these shoes. The M is not as wide as the B width I had always used. And, what about the formerly available C, D widths?I am very disappointed because I love this style. My hope now is that with wearing them I can go through the painful stretching process and make them work. Otherwise, I'll have to abandon this style and shop elsewhere."
1,Disappointed,"This shoe has been my favorite for long days of teaching school for many years. I was so disappointed they are no longer the same comfortable shoe. I thought I was imagining that they were smaller until I read the reviews. Apparently, I am not the only one disappointed. Thank you, Amazon for those reviews! Wish I would have read them before I bought this old favorite. They were much smaller and no longer leather. What a shame...Reebok is no longer a trusted name to me. I will now read the reviews before I buy an old standby order....things change and not for the better. Hope Reebok reads these reviews too!"
2,Reebok cheaped out...,"They changed the sneaker. One of the reasons I have ordered this sneaker (in white) for years and years is because the inside was made of a terry cloth material, which absorbs sweat better and which controls foot odor. When I received these I noticed they changed the inside material to the cheaper stuff (which is in almost all of their sneakers now) which does not absorb as well or control foot odor as well either. Even though the picture of the white sneaker on Amazon still shows the terry cloth interior. Needless to say I am very dissapointed in this product now."
1,Save your money....,"This is NOT the former princess aerobic shoe. Firstly, it is not even made of leather like it used to be. Secondly, it in no way resembles the comfort that the princess shoe used to have. Thirdly, the fit is nothing like it used to be. I still have an old pair that I checked and they ARE made of leather and they are a half size smaller than this shoe. This shoe was about 3/4 inch shorter. These are made in Viet Nam. I am very disappointed in Reebok."
4,Good casual wear shoe,"This is a comfortable leisure wear shoe that has a less aggressive profile than a heavy duty workout shoe so it doesn't look like you are wearing shoe boxes on your feet when you are out running errands or spending casual time. It is not supportive enough for a serious workout (per a professional trainer) but is an all-day comfortable shoe that provides some support and cushioning for all day wear.One thing that I especially like is that this shoe is cut slightly lower than most similar shoes around the ankle, so if you find that other brands tend to rub or hit your ankle, then these are worth a try.I have been told by one department store that this shoe is being discontinued, so if you like it, buy it now!"
4,Good Shoe,"This is my second pair of these, I find them to be a bit narrower than I remember, but I am hoping over time they will give a little."
4,my mom likes em,"i bought these for my mom , and she likes them alot , she says they are really comfy , so im happy"
5,Old favorite,Same good quality for last 20 years. No inflation? Price used to be $27.99. Fits well. Good for 2 years wear.
2,Quality going down fast,I buy this specific sneaker for years and the quality its getting worse. Use to last about 1 year a now after 2 month you can put it in the garbage. Already looking for replacements.
1,Reebok Princess Sneaker,"I have never had a problem in the past with the fit of this type shoe, and I have owned many pairs over the years. Unfortunately, this pair is so tight in the front of the shoe that I can't even get the shoe on. After reading several other reviews (which I should have done to begin with) I realized this same problem happened to many others. There is obviously a problem with where they are made. My particular pair were made in Vietnam. I love this style shoe but will go to a store where I can try them on first."
1,I won't take a chance on these even with amazon prime,"Due to the many review about the deterioration in quality and sizing I see no reason to purchase these shoes, even though years ago I had several reebok shoes I really liked. Just placed an order for LA Gear on shoes.com"
2,"Is this a ""knockoff?""","I have worn Reebok Princess shoes for several years because of the confort. This pair is not confortable. The leather is not as soft, and the fit is not quite right. This is the first pair I ever had that was made in Vietnam. Can this be the problem? I wanted to return them but the instructions were not clear. They came from BRICK OVEN thru AMAZON."
3,Not leather,"Like many other reviewers, I read the product description of a garment leather constructed shoe. When the shoes arrived, I noticed the man-made tag inside. I called Reebok, who confirmed that this was a vinyl product, and that the description was wrong, just as it is on their website. Good thing I shopped for the cheapest price on this item. All in all, the shoes are not a fashion statement, and look like I might be in the red-hat club, but, so far they are pretty comfortable. I have been wearing them for a week of 12 hour shifts in the ED. I am guessing that they will hold up for about 8 months, max and then I will be shopping for something else."
2,Disappointed in changes to this shoe,I have been buying the Reebok Princess shoes for over 15 years. I bought a black pair and white pair in the same size I have always purchased. They seemed a little tight in the toes but I thought since they are new they would relax. I then noticed that they are no longer made with leather but a man made product for the tops. It looks OK but if you put them side by side (I still have a new pair of white shoes which I bought last year) with a real leather version you can see a difference. I will keep the shoes I bought but I will be looking around for something else. I have liked these as I stand for hours at work and I liked the comfort without the clunky sports look so many shoes have. I wish the information about the shoes in the description had said they were a man made material. I probably would not have bought them.
5,Rebok Women's Princess Aerobics Shoe,"The first time I bought these shoes was on a sale. I had purchased a much more expensive pair of shoes to take on vacation. These were economical and I was going to save them for gardening, but took them as a back-up pair for the trip. We did a lot of walking and they proved to be more comfortable than the expensive ones. Since then, I've bought three more pairs. They are light weight, which I appreciate, but also give the right support. Also, due to a foot problem, I have to wear prescription orthotics and they fit well into these shoes."
5,Great for Walkers!,After and ankle injury it is difficult for me to jog. I found this shoe to be very comfortable when I walk. It is lightweight and flexible-perfect for what I need.
1,Reebok Women's Princess,"The first problem experienced with this product was the vendor. They sent this sneaker in a torn up box,poor condition, and the sneaker looked like it was glued together. It was just the worst experience on Amazon, which was ShopWss, so avoid them if you can. The sneaker itself was cut way to snug, and certainly not worth it. I've had better experiences with other Reebok athletic sneakers. Overall, even with the problem with the Vendor, it appears to be just a cheap sneaker. So, if you treasure your feet, and exercise fairly often, spend the money for a better quality high end Reebok or Nike."
1,Worse Purchase I Ever Made!!!,"First of all this product took forever to arrive. When it finally did, it was in my size, but somehow way too small. When I tried to put my foot in the shoe, the back of the shoe bent and I could not straighten it up again. The shoe was completely ruined. I had just arrived in a new state when I purchased it. Since I am handicap, going through the trouble of returning it was too much, so I simply through them away. It took me a while to find some shoes I trusted after that. i see that this product got good reviews from a lot of people, so I don't know what went wrong with the pair I purchased."
3,Not like they used to be,"I have only bought these shoes for the last 25 years or so; this pair seems tighter on the top of my foot, despite loosening the laces as loose as possible; the laces don't stay tied, despite my three knots, they seem coated with something, but I will change them out; the top of my foot hurts from wearing them, so I'm going to stretch them to see if it helps. The leather quality is excellent, and the fit is good."
1,Shoes don't fit,"The shoe did not fit like Reebok's of the past. Don't waste your money.I am very dissapointed, but I suppose this is a problem that will continue."
2,not sized correctly,"This says it is a Wide width, it is the same as my other black Reeboks. I wanted a wider one because I was on my feet for several hours. The white princess Reeboks are true to size but for some reason the Black ones are always smaller."
3,Not the best Reeboks.,I've bought this style of Reebok shoes for many years. The ones I bought here on Amazon are not nearly as comfortable as the ones I buy in the department stores. These ones have a very hard insole. I don't plan to buy them on Amazon again.
2,WARNING for wide/flat feet,"I purchased this product because of its excellent customer review. Little did I know that it is very narrow on the toe cap. When I first tried it on, it is so tight, as if my toes were suffocating. It is really not as comfortable as what the other reviewers mentioned. I would not recommend this product to those people that has wide/ flat feet."
3,Synthetic???,Reebok has ruined my favorite aerobic dance shoe by making it synthetic instead of the soft leather it has been for many years. Time to look for another brand........
2,Not wide,"This shoe is labeled 10W and it is not as wide as the white 10W Princess Reebok shoes I bought at my local show store. The whole reason I wanted a wide shoe is to be able to wear them with athletic socks, which I cannot do with these shoes. The shoes are only medium in width. I also am not happy that the upper is now made of plastic, not leather, as Reeboks used to be made."
2,They need to go back to leather.,I have worn the Reebok Princess Sneaker for years and years but now that they are no longer made of leather I think it is time for a change. My most recent pair were hot and uncomfortable. I won't buy them again.
2,Was this really a Wide?,I've been buying Reebok Princess for years and this one just seemed like it might have been mislabeled. It feels more like an R on my foot. JMO.
5,Reebock Womens Princess arerobics shoe,I have worn these for several months now and they continue to be my favorite. I had worn this shoe for several years and it is the best for quality and comfort.and will continue to order this shoe in black also.
2,Reebok-Princess,"Hi, these shoes do not have the support my others do, One shoe seems like it does not have any support."
5,Reebok Princess Aerobics Shoe,I am an older woman who walks on a track 2 miles every morning. I do not like the look of contemporary athletic shoes. My feet are in perfect shape so the conservative style of the Reebok Princess is perfect for me. They are inconspicupous enough to wear for less sporty occasions such as a trip to NYC.
4,Nice shoes and I will buy them again!,"It's the perfect pair of sneakers for my aerobics exercises. Fix well, they are comfortable and at very good price."
5,Reebok Princess,"Outstanding service from a great seller. Will not hesitate to purchase from them again. Good communications, well packaged, timely delivery."
5,Wow,Very pleased with purchase.My Mother-in-law has a hard time finding these shoes in her size.She was very glad we were able to find them and they arrived sooner than we expected. The shoes made it in time for Christmas.
2,Too narrow,"Have worn these shoes for years. The ones I recieved were so narrow at the toe, I had to order a W, which are now too wide in the rest of the shoe. Disappointed that Reebok made these changes."
4,Narrow and short,"These shoes are great but they run very narrow and somewhat short, especially if you plan to wear athletic socks with them."
5,Comfort,I find that the Reebok Princess is very comfortable whether walking or just wearing casually everyday and the price is very reasonable.
5,good aerobics shoe,I bought these for my step workouts. I like them because they have a smooth sole which makes pivot turns easier. They have decent enough support and have been my aerobic shoe for a few years now.
5,comfort + style,"these shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes i've ever worn. they look good, they're durable and have a good price. i definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a good sneaker."
5,Reebok Aerobics Shoe,I love these athletic shoes! I've tried other big name brands and none fit as well or are as comfortable as the Reebok Princess. I walk a lot and work out everyday and these shoes are absolutely the best!
5,like a slipper,"reebok princess women's sneaker is the very comfortable and flexible. it works for me-true to size and width. Because of bunions that i have, this is the best sneaker i've found so far that fits my needs. this is my 5th pair and i purchased them from amazon.com because the price was the most reasonable."
3,Style doesn't fit the way it used to,"I've worn Reebok Princess shoes for decades, buying new when my old shoes are too worn out, because of the fit. This most recent purchase doesn't support my arches the way the Princess had in the past. And the laces on this model are too short. I have a high instep and the lace on these new shoes is so short, I can barely tie a bow. I don't know if Reebok has changed the fit of the Princess, or has sold Amazon a less well made version, keeping the best to sell themselves. All I know is that after a day's work my feet get more tired than they used to."
1,Made differently - never used them!!!,I have worn this sty le and brand for many years.When I received the sneakers and tried them on THEY WERE CUT DIFFERENTLY and were of no use to me.The company WOULD NOT REPLACE the sneakers even though they were brand new!!!!I will NEVER purchase shoes online again!!!!
1,Not Sized correctly,"The shoes wear much too small. I have worn this Reebok for years. So I felt good about buying my size on Amazon, I was very disappointed they were too small. They were made in a different country from my old Reebok shoes. I have returned them and Amazon has given me a refund. Thank you very much."
1,dissatisfied,This order was most unsatisfactory. I received the shoes with the security device attached. I had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached. I have yet to receive them. I would advise customers to avoid orders.
1,"Terrible, Terrible service. Not even Reebox sneakers","I received something I would not even look at in a store. Not Reebok sneakers, but a brand I've never heard of. The only thing right was the size.When I e-mailed the Co. I never received any response. When I inquired atPost Office re: shipping and handling I just gave them away. I can understand mistakes being made, but to ignore a customer is completly wrong. They actually sent me cranberry sneakers when I orderdthe all white Princess style."
1,?,They had the shoes when I made the purchase but later they told me they didn't have them available. So it was canceled. When I checked back this size of shoes is available again but with a markup. I guess they just didn't want to sell them at the sale price as they listed online.
5,I buy them for my wife,"I buy them for my wife, she want wear any other kind. she loves them. she would not wear any thing else."
2,not as advertised,"Had previously given feedback that the item was not as expected as when received it said ""man made materials"". Clearly the advertisement stated ""leather"". When I looked on the feedback comments list later after posting, they said it was ""man made leather"", which is a COMPLETE lie as if they would do their research they would know there is no such thing as ""man made leather"". Leather is leather and that's that. Will not return item as don't want to pay shipping, but will NEVER order these on line again."
5,Pleasure!,"These are the best Reebock Women's sneeker ... no hard bands or ridge around the toe just nice soft leather that makes your feet feel great. These have been my favorite shoes for a few years, and it's very appropriately named Princess as they make you feel like your special in them."
2,Harder to get set up on the computer than it should be,"We bought two singler user copies through the mail. What they fail to tell you is you have to disable all firewall, antivirus software and internet security software before installing this product. Otherwise it won't connect to their server to register when the registration screen comes up, and it won't connect to download the initial updates you need. If you have Norton Internet Security on your computer, you have to disable that to scan for updates or it won't connect to their server. Also, their links to their web site through the software didn't work. I had to do a search to find the manufacturer's web site to get anywhere. If you want to speak with live chat, you have to go through FAQ to click the link to a web site that will give you a link for live chat. So far the software is working fine after getting through all the kinks to get registered and updates downloaded. There is probably easier software to use out there."
1,Buy an Alternate Product,"I bought Zerospyware (download version) from Amazon.com. The product would not auto-update. I sought support from the publisher, I received no support. Buy an alternate product."
1,Lousy Gateway service,"We purchased a Gateway computer from Office Depot about six months ago. Something happened in the meantime to make Windows unstable, so we had to use the restore partition. Problem one-restore partition defective, we need the restore disk. Couldn't find it. So we call 1-800-GATEWAY. We are told, get this, that only if you buy direct from the Gateway website can you call 1-800-GATEWAY. If you purchased it anywhere else you have to call a toll number. WTF????!!!!! So we call the toll number. After making us go through the restore routine again and wasting our time, we are told we have to spend $20.00 to get a new restore disk. Again, WTF? It costs them $20.00 to burn that disk. NOT! Do NOT buy a Gateway. They do NOT support their equipment."
5,amazing,"this item came perfectlooks wayy better in personthe colors are bright and just awesomeif you're thinking about buying it, i say go for itits really great."
5,Easy to read,this edition of this book is very easy to read. having the translation directly underneath italian is nice. This is 1 of my favorite books for soprano singing.
5,Wendy A.,This is a great collection of Italian songs and having a CD to accompany is so useful. This arrived on time and in excellent condition. It brings back memories of many hours in voice training years ago!
4,Cecilia Bartoli,"If she sings them that means that you should sing them also. ok good be good. they make you a better person like spinach it builds character or something like ""eating suasages together""-eddie izzard She sounds incredible so if you wish to sound somewhere near incredible you should sing them i love them"
4,Very good for vocal studies,This is the quintessencial collection for vocal studies for the medium high voice. A real tradition.
1,Never showed up,"This book never came! I would like a refund.I needed this book for one of my classes so I bought it at a local store while I was ""waiting"" for the book I purchased to arrive. I love this book and the CD accompaniment. There are songs right at my level as a beginning college vocal student."
2,Not useful for a beginner,"I sing in a choir and can read music, but I can't sing a ""D"" when I see a ""D"". Because the CD plays the accompanient, I have no idea what are the notes I'm supposed to sing. So this purchase was pretty useless to me.This product would probably be better for someone more advanced."
5,Essential repertoire for students and teachers.,"This book is perfect for both students and teachers. This book has alot of well known pieces and it is essential for any young singers repertoire. It contains songs like ""Sebben,crudele by Caldara"", ""O del mio dolce ardor, by Gluck"", and ""Caro mio ben, by Giordani"". I give this book 5 stars because it was very useful to me throughout highschool,college,and now as a teacher."
5,?,I love the fact that this music anthology now comes with a CD for practicing purposes. It makes it fun to rehearse.
2,This man needs to edit,"There are some great photos in here and then some so-so ones. I found that flipping through this book became boring. After a while, seeing the same woman with her legs around her ears starts to get old. I guess that's what marriage is all about, but I'm not married to her. My real complaint is the over abundance of simaler images. Some of these pictures are better than the others. She's a beautiful woman, but less is more."
3,"A more accurate title: ""My Wife's Vagina""","Hegre's wife is attractive, and many pictures in this book are nicely done. He has done a good job of recording her great body and spirited personality. There is a great variety of locations and situations, a little of everything, and the book is well printed.But too many of the photographs are tiresome repetitions of her shaved vagina. OK, sure, it is attractive and all that, but this book would have been stronger if about half of the vag pictures remained sealed in a box at the Hegre's home, and not been included in this book."
2,Family Album,"Did I get the same book as the other reviewers? This is not much more than a family album for an obviously uninhibited couple. Yes the lighting and camera work is competent but I found the photographs woefully lacking in erotic appeal. There may be a voyeuristic appeal for some as most of the photographs appear spontaneous. I consider this book to be a less raunchy and more attractive version of Natacha Merritt's Digital Diaries. There are a few nice shots but this is not an Eric Kroll, Roy Stuart, or Helmut Newton collection. There is very little style."
3,The book was ruined for me...,"My perception of this book was ruined I think by seeing the full size pictures first. While in Hamburg, Germany I was lucky enough to see Petter Hegre's work on display at the Erotic Art Museum (on the corner of Grosse Freiheit and Reeperbahn if you get the chance). Impressed, I looked through the book in the gift shop.How disappointing. The power of the pictures is lost in the small format. Instead of seeing them as pieces of art, I couldn't help but look at the book as a collection of someone else's snapshots. It's nothing more than a photo album of mediocre pictures."
3,they do have a cat.,"Its an interesting book with a certain sense of voyeurism, as if one is viewing private photographs belonging to someone else. This is probably so because many of the images display a snapshot quality; which in itself may not be a bad thing. However, I'm not convinced that all the photographs in this book were taken with cameras worth $100 or less as the author claims, especially when the model is holding a $1800 medium format camera in one of the shots. I also did not find much merit in the three nipple shot.This book may or may not float your boat. For me, it has required me to reconsider at how I delineate the lines between ponography and artistic commentary and and ultimately, good taste."
4,My Wife,"My Wife is a wonderful book. Certain photos were unbelievably intimate and mesmerizing. There were others that were too ""snap shot"" quality for my personal taste. I think that the female body is very beautiful but seeing numerous photos of the same gentalia is a little monotonous. There is a second woman in a few of the photos who is unidentified. Hegre's wife and the second woman are in several photos in a sexual manner which does break up the boringness of the layout. I do realize that I concentrated on the negative aspects of the book, but overall it is a good book and I would recommend it to others."
1,yawn...a typically boring exhibit of our times,"it's no accident that a divorce quickly followed the publication of this pathetic ""work.""you almost can't blame the ex-husband (no, I wouldn't go so far as to call him a photographer or artist). he is just doing what is popular today, but there is certainly nothing daring here. it is what everyone else is doing.there is also nothing sexy here because there is no mystery and no intimacy.for that you need a closed door."
4,Very good DOOM 2 handheld.,"I don't think you could find a better handheld DOOM 2 graphically and sound wise. However, the control scheme is a bit awkward with the ZODIAC'S analog stick.Once one gets used to the ultra sensitivity and instability with walking and turns , this is a very good handheld version of DOOM 2.Looks damn good on the large Zodiac screen. Looks and sounds better than the GBA version but again I give control to the GBA.A must have for anyone that owns a ZOD and wants a very good DOOM 2 port ; recommended."
4,Good look,Pretty good quality for the price. Locally I priced these at $30 to $50 each. Good buy. I would recommend.
3,"Stay with the 70""s..or The living Room cd......","Love Carole King...but alot of her 80's work just sounds dull....not bad but nothing that will stick in your heart,soul and mind. And we all know Carole King for this reason. If you have her other works...and want to complete your library..then yes. If your selective, and want better lp/cd's..I'd give a listen to her other works. I really enjoy her...2001 c d...""Love makes the World"". and Sample...""The Living Room"". The recent..Re-releases of the late 70's...once again alittle plain..with a few good tracks. Thouroughbred lp/cd...mid seventies...good selection here...worth the buy. Check her out...she's awesome...R.C. Kansas City"
3,"Not bad, but not really that great","As a historian of science and technology, and also a person very interested in computer science and fascinated by poetry as well, this book looked like a full 5 stars at first. Like some of the other reviewers, I felt swamped by the details of Ada's emotional life; yet, there are flashes of brilliance where the author makes a clear connection between her social position, her interior life as we can best judge it, and her pursuits. I wonder if there would have been a better way to organize the book; as it stands now, the book is almost purely narrative (with some asides and flashbacks), and appears to be aimed at the popular reader with a seasoning of technical information to goad the more serious critic into reading on. On the positive side, I was pleased to read a clarification of Ada's role in the Babbage Difference Engine's precocious presentation. And at times, the story was fascinating. Other times, it was just plain soggy."
4,Science and Poetry,"Who better than Ada Byron can represent the turn from Romanticism to Victorian age in England? Ada, the heiress of the great poet Lord Byron has not only lived in such transitory epoch, but Passion and Science were running in her very own blood. She was brought up by her mother, Lady Byron, and initiated by her to mathematical and rational studies, everything that would keep Ada as far as possible from the tenebrous, irrational, dangerous and very passionate style of life of her father. This life style is what had led to the separation after only one year of merriage, between Lord and Lady Byron accompained by scandals grief and resentment. Lady Byron's reaction to it was to try to repress Ada's paternal romantic vein with science. This will bring Ada to be in contact with the best scientists of the moment and even to be remembered as the first computer programmer, but won't preclude her from being a real Byron..."
4,Does Not Work on MacBook Pro,I originally purchased this product for a Dell Notebook many years ago and then used it with my replacement Fujitsu tablet/notebook. I recently purchased a MacBook Pro and discovered that the two prong plug on the MacBook is slightly different and will not fit. No other product is as slick as this one and I wish that they made one that fit the MacBook.
4,"Works, but unsure if it really works.","The surge protector connectors fit perfectly. The surge protector works, and I can use my laptop with it, but I can't say for sure if it REALLY works (which is why it only gets 4 out of 5). Hopefully I won't ever have to find out, but if it doesn't work, there is a $40,000 policy that comes with it to replace equipment and recover data if a surge does damage your equipment while the surge protector is in use. SAVE THE BOX AND RECEIPT in-case you ever have to make a claim."
3,Okay,"The cords on both sides tend to disconnect, and it doesn't fold up nicely with existing cables."
4,Handy Surge Protector,"Love the idea of being able to have power protection with our laptop wherever it goes! Just be sure to order the correct one for your computer, as there are two different plugs depending on your battery pack - two prongs or three.Only issue: I have the three-prong style at home, and the cord seems much more durable and fitted for a laptop. The cord on this two-prong style, which we use at work, is more like a standard lamp cord."
3,Weak cable,"Edit: Didn't stand up to heavy use. The table attachment to the grey housing frayed after about a year. I expected a little more durability from APC.Small, portable, and streamlined with a little gap in the bottom to strap it to my actual power supply. Wish it had come with a power cord that fit my Mac but otherwise seems to work great.The catch of course is that I can't *really* test this until my laptop gets hit by a surge. APC has a good reputation so I don't think that will be an issue."
5,Laptop surge suppressor,"Excellent, compact surge suppressor that can be easily wrapped up with the power cable on a Dell Inspiron."
2,wasn't what I needed/wanted,"it is a 2 wire, and I needed a 3 wire. would have cost more to return them than what I paid, so I threw them away."
3,Steelers Sled,"Purchased as a gift. Arrived promptly and in good condition. Item is more of a pool toy then an inner tube, fairly cheaply made and overpriced."
5,Great gun,"i have played paintball for 1 year now,THIS GUN IS REALLY GOOD!!! It's the best price you can find!! it is totally accurate and shoots like a tippman 98 custom!!! the barrel maybe a little short but just get a different one the barrel it comes with is actually not that bad! GREAT GUN!!!"
5,Great choice,"Bought this for my son, and he LOVES it! An excellent choice, and a great piece in comparison to the other 'big name'and ultimately more expensive models!"
3,i have this gun,"this gun is a begginer gun. its ok. mine came with a handle though, i dont know why they removed it. its good for a first gun if u need all the stuff with it. Dont buy this. get a spyder sonix or an mr1. and mr1 ir about as much as this is. and the sonix is about [...] bux more.GET SOME OTHER BEGGINER GUN!!!!!"
2,I almost hated it,"This is a poorly written movie. The preacher fills up way to much time with nonsense. It's like Kevin had a bunch of ideas and crammed them in to this movie, but they were not exactly put together in an intelligent way. I hope Kevin's wife paddles hims for making this."
3,"Well, it was different","About the nicest thing I can say about this movie is that it was totally unpredictable. Three high schoolers venture into the woods, thinking they're going to ""get some,"" but they end up getting more than they bargained for. Religious fanatics tie them up and put them in cages.I thought the beginning was very compelling, and I thought I knew where it was going, which had me wincing. But I was totally wrong. There is no real protagonist, and the story shifts focus about half-way through (which is sad, because I was much more interested in the goings-on inside the church) I was confused about one thing. The religious fanatics obviously had an issue with homosexuals... so why did they cage the 3 boys who were responding to an offer for heterosexual sex? Oh well. It was watchable and different from anything I've seen before, so if you want something different, give it a shot."
4,"Kevin Smith is holding back. ""Red State"" displays a true potential for more!","Kevin Smith's most recent and last film ""Red State"" features a kick ass performance from John Goodman. It was a change of pace for Smith. It's preachy, it's thought-provoking, and it's controversial. The film made me wonder what else he's capable of. With this piece, I think he's throwing in the towel way too soon because I feel there's a lot more left unexplored inside the mind of a filmmaker who brought us ""Clerks"", ""Dogma"", and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back""."
1,The disc was defective,"got it as a gift, so I don't have the return info, it was the second time I got a RED STATE that didn't work in my DVD player"
3,"Yes, that Kevin Smith made a horror, and it's quite decent","What's it about?A group of teens join an internet community to find sex, only to be tricked and kidnapped by a violent and disturbing cult, run by an evil leader.Is it any good?A huge departure from comedy styling's of Kevin Smith, but ultimately, a decent one. A top performance from Michael Parks as the cult leader and some genially surprising moments make this one worth seeing. Might make you think twice about online dating.Best bit?One of the teens tries to escape the compound - edge of your seat stuff.Did you know?Kevin Smith self distributed the film in selected US cinemas."
2,Actually pissed off after watching it,"Maybe I take on the mood of the film, but this left me angry. First it runs on way too long during times when it is unnecessary. You have to listen to the churchgoers go on and on and on spewing their hatred - it takes up most of the movie. Yes, the characters were great, the acting was fantastic. I absolutely loved John Goodman. Damn it, though I wish the movie told me something I didn't know. Instead it just worked real hard at converting me into a cultist through exposure. Oh, and how the hell is this a horror movie?"
5,Kevin Smith is a genius.,"1. Amazon rocks. Always good service and speedy delivery.2. Kevin Smith is a genius. :) I love all his movies and this is no different.If you are looking for a film maker who is willing to go places that others find difficult, who has an amazing sense of human relationships, and an amazing point of view this is your guy. You may have only seen Kevin as Silent Bob, but he is so much more than that and this will show you that. Versatile, thought provoking, and honest."
3,A sad commentary on where we are even today.,"Although the acting of the villain is a little over the top, the story is a compelling and frighteningly similar to where society is today."
5,Amazing,This is the best Kevin Smith room to date. Absolutely incredible and twists at every turn. I'm showing this to all my friends
5,"Waco, in the modern ""Patriot Act"" time","This movie is somewhat a resemblance of the Waco siege, except Kevin adds a ""Patriot Act"" twist to it, you know, where every citizen is a terrorist. It's like looking into the future."
1,yuck,This movie was weird and not real world credible (ie not really believable). I didn't relate to or like a single one of the characters and dialog was empty and I had to fast forward many of the speeches and conversations because they were boring. I rented this movie because it had a 4 star rating... It is definitely NOT a 4 star movie. Clearly Amazon's rating system is flawed and I regret my purchase.
1,WORST Kevin Smith movie EVER,"I love many Kevin Smith movies, I like most of the rest, but I HATE this movie. I made it through the whole thing unlike many who turned it off after 30 minutes. Unfortunately it just keeps getting worse. John Goodman is pretty good in it but that's about it. The film is nothing but static characters, silly plot twists, non-sensical acts and there are no real protagonists... Cop Out is GENIUS compared to this crap... Kevin Smith should be ashamed and should do better."
1,Kevin Smith - what were you thinking?,"WOW, this is the worst thing I've seen in YEARS!!! Normally Kevin Smith movies are a guaranteed good time, but this movie was awful. 1 stinker in the bunch won't stop me from immediately see Smith work in the future. MORE JAY AND SILENT BOB MATERIAL !!!!!"
4,Ambitious and Unsettling,"RED STATE swings for the fences and while the final result is no grand slam it is a healthy and dynamic home run. The script is ambitious and atypical, leading the viewer through a twisting maze that constantly surprises and upsets the audiences expectations every time they believe they have found their bearings. The performances from the cast are second to none, especially true for Michael Parks and John Goodman. The direction and editing are solid and clear, leaving no room for sentimentality and complimenting the story's brutal nature perfectly.This is not a comfortable movie to watch. It is harsh and unsettling. But it is a movie that does what the best movies should: invite its audience to reconsider the shape of the lens through which they view the world."
5,Stunning gory tale of morality!,"I had the pleasure of seeing this and wow. Great story, John Goodman gives his best performance in ages. I'd Recommend this film to anyone. Not the usual Kevin Smith film."
2,It's not a bad movie. It's just not very good.,"Not campy enough to be funny and not smart enough to be thrilling or scary. I'd say it was trying too hard to be different things if it felt like it was trying at all. Smith picks an easy target (religious fundamentalists), makes some ham-fisted (and OBVIOUS) observations, and throws in a few jabs at the ATF which felt extremely dated. There's nothing edgy or new here. Pedestrian and predictable.Goodman and Leo are decent as always but the script doesn't give either of them much to do so all we get is one note performances from both. And Stephen Root, Kevin Pollack and Anna Gunn are completely wasted. I wasn't exactly looking for nuance in a Kevin Smith movie, but still... there's a lot of talent here and you want them to do more than run around and yell or get shot in the face.Ugh - the more I think about it the worse it gets. Save your money."
2,Mreh...worth watching once,"I am definitely a Kevin Smith fan. That said, this was only so-so. Not horrible by any stretch, and entertaining for the time alotted, but that's it. It doesn't do anything new, and is pretty much a self-indulgent romp through stereotypes with a few troubled navel-gazers thrown in to make it less monochromatic. There are some great performances by Parks and Goodman, and it's pretty well done, but the story is nothing special at all."
4,"As a born-again Christian, I approve.","To begin with, this movie has nothing to do with real Christians, but dangerous cults like the Westboro Baptist Church. That being said, good job Kevin Smith! This film is definitely a tight little thriller at times, along with some of Smith's trademark humor, as crude as it may be at times. Though I'm sure a lot of those offended by this were probably just as offended by Dogma (another one of Smith's better films). I mean, let's face it. Buddy Christ wasn't a slap at Christ, if anything he represents the ""message"" of ""prosperity preachers"" like Joel Olsteen.Of course, Smith puts in a decent amount of nice little extras. I always say that trailers should be a given. However, commentary would be nice. Overall, it's a good little Thriller and Parks and Goodman are both excellent, as well as most of the cast."
2,choppy,"I was eager to watch this because I loved the intelligence, and social criticism of Dogma. I was disappointed. I could understand the main plot, but the finale was very weak....one of the cult understands way more than she should be able to in the midst of the action....govt orders are screwy and illogical. I am all for painting with a brush that reveals, but when it gets beyond belief any message is muddied."
2,Why so many stars?,"Where to start. Right away with the 5 minutes of preposition in the classroom I knew it was going to be a lazily written movie. I just didn't know how bad. I can look past a lot of things but there are too many instances where the characters actions were far too outlandish, even in an outlandish movie. The setup of getting the teenagers to the church was very B Movie in and of itself. Then you have a teenager with a fully loaded, fully automatic weapon who decides to run through a crowd of armed people as opposed to fire a few shots. I commend the movie for shooting him unexpectedly at least. Then the focal characters get killed easily, and I'm thinking...what's the point? If there was more to the movie, and more plot, more character development I would applaud the unexpected killing of some of the main characters, but this isn't A Game of Thrones and it just left me thinking I wasted $11."
2,Left me hanging,"I understand the story plot, the truth behind it, BUT, this was about the most unexciting movie I have ever seen. Nothing shook me up."
1,I would give this negative stars if I could,"Couldn't even make it past the first five minutes. I'm not a prude, but do they need to drop the F bomb every other word? It was like listening to a 16 year old's fantasy over a playboy magazine. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love this movie. Bad writing (Can you really call it writing if it's just a string of profanity), bad acting, bad directing, overall a horribly bad movie. Just glad I didn't drop $20 in a theater to see this! I wouldn't watch this if you paid me. Don't believe the other reviews. They have to be paid reviewers. There is nothing redeeming about this movie!"
1,"You will NEVER see Hollywood make a film called ""BLUE STATE""","The title of the film is clear what this film is; an attempt to smear anyone not far left and Christians, in particular. However, for bigoted liberals, such ridicule is fair game, isn't it?"
1,"Ooooooooh, SO edgy! So out there! Imagine... Crazy Christians!!!","Yee Haw! Those whackjob christians are at it again! Thank Obama, our military are there to save everyone---especially the children---just like last time at Waco when they burned dozens of children and women alive... to save them, of course. Mission accomplished! Now, had the director chosen to make a film about religious extremists of another faith, the J word, say? Well then the film would never have been made or seen by anyone.And, by the way, all you shill reviewers... give it up, dudes. The film sucks and everybody knows it. So STFU."
1,Predictable Liberal Garbage,"Come up with something original. Just more boring, predictable left wing trash, just go on the daily show and complain for 15 minutes and that's basically your movie..."
1,Is it torture to watch,"I had to turn it off after probably 30 minutes. Maybe it turns around after that but it wasn't looking like it. I wasn't sure what the movie was about, i figured an action flick by the looks of the cover. Not the case! My fault for not researching it first but wow it was torture to watch. My wife was not happy with me until i turned it off and even then i was in trouble for subjecting her to a movie where people are tortured and killed while a crazy religious nut preaches. Not a cool movie. Not enjoyable. If you get through it you wont watch it again or ever recommend it to a friend. Maybe if you like Human Centipede type movies you could like this. You've been warned..."
1,Noooo!,"Come on, really! This was really bad even for a low budget movie. The theme of the movie was to kill sinners in the name of the Bible. Really! But beyond the perverted theme, this movie was bad. This may be the first Blu-ray DVD I ever break."
1,Stupiod,i should do more research before i buy movies. i wish i could get my money back from amazon for entertaining it. dont buy it or watch.
1,Ugh!,Yuck. What a mess.Worst and most overrated filmmaker of ALL TIME!Why doesn't Smith just hang it up while people still like him?
3,"Clever, Different, and Passable","I am a huge Kevin Smith fan, and so I was intrigued to see what this film had to offer. The premise is quite clever and unique (small town, religious nutcases, entrapping folks for torture/murder, etc). In terms of gore, the film does not have much at all. This is quite a good thing, as it leaves room for a more chilling psychological journey. I found the religious zealots to be quite scary, and of course, John Goodman's acting as a Gov't official was superb! All in all, the diologue was sparse and a little trite, the film different, worth at least one viewing. This film has zero comedy in it which is quite a departure from Smith. Fans of his trademark monologue will find it being delivered by Goodman in the closing scene."
3,Meh,"It's okay for a B movie. I feel the ""crazy religious people gone rogue"" story has been done already in some form, so I was hoping this movie would bring something new to the table. It didn't really, but it's still okay, as a stand alone film. The ending was disappointing, kind of cheesy really."
3,Young Man,"This album is really just the start of what we are about to hear and see Mr. David Young accomplish. He loves jazz, he has since he was little. He worships Ellington as the man should. He takes what he loves and does it, he tries things out, he grows and that shows in the way he plays. Although the particular album isn't my favorite way to hear him, it is a learning experince for him and I know it is not his last.I would rather hear him in an open room, in a hall way, in his own house, in his socks. I like it raw, and I hope he can put out some of his idea's that way someday, because it is the best way to hear a persons heart. He does what he wants, and he doesn't stop when he makes mistakes, and that to me, is the essence of a true musician, and real spirit. He is an endearing human being, but he is still very young."
4,Cute Dinosaur,"I bought this for my 3-year-old son who asked Santa for a T-Rex. He didn't say what kind of T-Rex or what he hoped it would do or any other ""clues"" about this dinosaur he had in mind, so I simply found this stuffed dinosaur and hoped it would make him happy. He loves it! It's about as big as he is, and he thinks it's pretty cool. He loves to play with things that lets him use his imagination rather than toys that do things for him or make their own noises, so this was perfect."
4,Trex stuffed animal,My son got the Trex for Christmas and he loves it. Brings him to bed with him at night. It came really quickly in the mail too.
4,roooooooar!,"My 3yr old loves this dinosaur.....definitely turned him on to the world of the dinosaurs,he can't get enough info about them :D"
3,Large and in charge,My son loves this dino he takes it to bed every night. The only thing I can say negative about it is I think it was a little pricey for a stuffed animal. Overall though he likes it and I guess thats all that matters.
1,What the heck!,"Seriously, why in the world would someone other than a parent buy this as a gift? My son just received this as a gift, we have a super small house, and he has allergy's so this huge, stuffed dino is not needed, nor wanted. Regifting is in it's future, if it's not exchangable. :-)"
3,Lotta Dinasaur!!,"My nephew loved the dinosaur however, I am a little concerned about the rods legs and tail. Did not see that in the product description. Overall, the quality of the product was very good."
2,I would not buy again,The dinosaur's leg came with the fabric torn and the inside stuffing coming out. Crazy. Not worth the hassle to send back.
2,Cute but poorly made!,My son was gaga over this dinosaur but what a disappointment when the mouth stitches unraveled in less than a day! It's not like you can take the new beloved toy and return it. We had to carefully resew the mouth ourselves. Not eager to see how the rest of the seams hold up.
2,Does not pose too well,"Hard to pose in a realistic manner. Not really cuddly. Looks like it does in the picture, but has hard wires running through it to keep it standing."
5,awesome,My son got this for his 4th birthday and LOVES it!!! it is well made and is huge and looks just like the picture. the arms are a bit shorter than I thought but it is still an awesome toy!! :o]
4,He loves it!,"I got this toy for my nephew's 4th birthday. He asked me specifically for a HUGE dinosaur. The measurements for this guy said 32"". I thought that meant head to floor, actually it meant head to tip of tail, which almost cut the head to floor height in half. That was a little deceptive, but little man didn't notice. I was a little disappointed but he loves his BIG dinosaur! The height description would be the only thing I'd change."
5,Very Nice for the Price,When I first got this thing out of the box my four year old daughter came over and gave it a big hug and then later my two year old daughter hopped on its back and tried to ride it. I enjoy chasing them around the house with it since its always got that growl face going. My kids enjoy it and have lots of fun dragging it around the house. The quality is pretty nice and it can be posed with the wires in its body and its pretty durable. The color is kind of weird but my kids don't care and the size is pretty nice given the price of it. Its outside is kind of soft but the inside is hard and the quality of outside isn't the softest material but it will do. Given the price and my kids enjoyment thus far I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Incomplete review,"I can only review this toy from a distance, as I ordered it for my grandson, and have not seen it as yet. His mother, however, states that he loves the toy. When opening it for his birthday, he became ecstatic, pulled the dinosaur from the box, and has not let it leave his side since receiving it. (He does not sleep with it, however; perhaps it is too big. It remains by his bed all night, though.) He's had it for some three weeks now, and it shows no signs of deterioration or wear."
2,Not Huggins' best effort,"I have to be honest here. I LOVED The Reckoning, Cain, and Hunter. I've reread those three books a few times apiece, and will probably do so again in the future. For all-out action they're tough to beat. So when I bought a copy of Leviathan I was expecting the same quality but came away disappointed. I don't really know why but Leviathan never hit me with the impact the other three books did. It wasn't the subject matter; heck, I LOVE Thor as a character and am into Norse mythology. Basically the writing didn't seem as polished as his other books and the excitement just wasn't there. I don't want to slam Huggins here but I have to be honest. Mr. Huggins, if you're reading this, just know that I am looking forward to your next book and I truly hope it's as good as the aforementioned three. You're still one of my favorite authors!"
4,Adventure with a religious twist,"While I enjoyed this novel very much, I could see this as a movie on the Syfy Channel. It definitely has all the elements you would find in one, a group of scientists working on a secret military project in a remote area, an unlikely hero in a Viking type man with a mysterious history of his own, and a hired man just trying to protect his wife and child. For action fans, the action is non-stop, particularly the last half of the book. Huggins knows his audience and gives them what they want!"
5,One of the better Science Fictions I've Read in a long time!,This book kept me spellbound until the very end. I couldn't put it down!
1,Purple prose,I have never felt strongly enough about a product to remark online about it -- until now -- nor am I going to waste my words on it beyond this simple warning:DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS MINDLESS DRIVEL.God is everywhere but in the writing of this purple prose.
5,Happy,Batteries work like a charm. Extremely satisfied. Although the plastic holding them was cracked and a little chipped away they were still perfectly fine.
5,honest dealing,"We received the batteries 3 days ahead of when they were promised. First purchase from tool king. If performance is on par with ease of transaction, then I will be a repeat customer."
3,"I'm not a math major, but...","This may be a stupid question, but aren't you supposed to be getting a ""deal"" when you buy multiples of an item? Why would I buy the two pack of these batteries for roughly $180.00, when I can buy two of the singles for almost $30 less? Am I the only one who is puzzled by this? I came onto Amazon and was about to buy the 18v 3.0a, 2-pack of these Makita batteries, when I noticed it would be cheaper to buy 2 solo. Now I'm stumped... Am I crazy or am I right, opinions wanted!-Andyroo"
3,9 mnths then dead,"Had these for 9 mnths , one dead after 8 mnths other one wont charge after 9mnths. Have had this type of battery since they came out Generally you can get 2yrs out of them. Bought more from a hardware store, they lasted 6mnths. Waiting for reply on the 8-9 months for replacement."
4,"Great Batteries, Outrageous Price","When you have lots of Makita power tools, you need lots of batteries. The good news is, their batteries are great. Very powerful and long lasting. The bad news, they charge a fortune for them. So it's a love hate kind of thing. I love the batteries. I hate the price. That's why I only give them four stars. Functionally they deserve five, but price wise, only 2 or 3."
1,Makita 18 volt batteries,"I have about (10) Makita 18 volt lion tools. The batteries are garbage. They are so over-priced that it is ridiculous, (ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT THEY DON'T LAST) The batteries cost as much as the tools. Thay now sell compatible ones on Ebay for half price. I don't know how good they are but they are both from China anyway.Jack Braddell"
4,Work fine; price a bit steep.,"I have several Makita tools which will accept these batteries. Some came standard with the 1.5 AH batteries, but after 2+ years, the original batteries stopped taking a charge. These are heavier, but the longer operating time is useful. I'd rate them 5-stars if the price was less - maybe they'll go on sale sometime. If so, I'd stock up. I've been happy with Makita tools for many years - since my first 9.6 volt drill a long time ago."
3,new batteries,"Thay are batteries what can i say. They work, their new. came in a brand new package. perfect. shiny. none scratched"
5,Very Satisfied,"These three hour batteries are amazing, I have nine different Makita cordless devices and these three hour batteries do a great job holding up for long periods between charges."
1,Faulty design on BL1830,"There is an intelligent circuit board inside the pack that needs to be powered, and it draws its power from the very cells it is monitoring.The basic design flaw is that the circuit is wired to be powered by only one of the many cells in the pack. The board draws a constant although small current from that single cell. If the battery is not used for a few weeks then that cell will deep discharge causing a weak link in the bank of cells, the pack then fails in the charger.Makita has programmed the circuitry so that if you try to charge the battery 3 times in this state, it will permanently disable it. Normal behavior is to think ""why is it not charging, let me try again"". If more than 1 year old, it is out of warranty.Makita should step up, redesign the battery, and offer on their website to replace any batteries which have not been abused with the new design.I would not buy any more Makita tools powered by this battery."
1,poor quality,"Like others in the reviews, I bought a combo coming with 2 batteries. This was sept 2010. The first one fail after 1 months and a half. Amazon was helpfull to replace it. In the same time, I bought another one, having then 3 working batteries (just precaution). About a year later, another failed !!! Same as described by other review.How can, on 3 batteries, having 2 failures ? I'm not the one complaining for having once a lemon. It can happen.But this time it is not just ""bad luck"" but ""bad product"".The tool and the system is great. The time to recharge is perfect. I had even bought the grinder and others.I have still a Ryobi for now 7 years, on 18 volts (just one battery) and this is still working without any problem.How can makita going under the quality of Ryobi ?My recommendation. Stay away from this tool until they change the design of the batteries ! At nearly 80 USD each,this is a very expensive way if you have to change them every 6 months !!!"
1,flawed,I have 2 of these batteries that are just over a year old and now won't charge due to the flawed design.
1,Design flaw. Don't buy!,"These batteries and the Makita tools they fit are ""just good enough"". After a few months off work due to injury, one battery died in the charger. The charge lights indicate it should be almost finished but an audible alarm is beeping and the charger is obviously not charging.Keep these batteries indoors and fully charged if you have any downtime from work!"
2,Not so good.,My older Dewalt 18volt batteries work and lasted longer then this battery. I am not happy with the tools or the Battery. Sorry.
5,What a battery!!!,"Having gone through several batteries with DeWalt products, I decided to shop around and see if I could find a ""better mouse trap"". I purchased these extra batteries thinking that they would be on par with the DeWalt's. Boy was I wrong!!! The charge on these last a long time. I have a four man crew with two impact screw guns, a chordless sawzall and a heavy duty drill. We have five batteries total and one single charger. I cant think of a time that anyone of us was waiting on a ""hot"" battery! Very satisfied!"
3,Superb Performance With Disappointing Quality Control,"My local Makita repair shop has replaced or repaired some of my defective Makita cordless tools free of charge. I appreciate their fast turnaround time, and good service. At the same time, my loyalty to Makita is eroding. I hope these new batteries are as reliable as the Makita tools of 15-20 years ago."
1,Faulty Batteries,We bought a lot of these tools and batteries and now are stuck with a lot of tools and 2 out of 11 batteries that still work. They are designed to die. We don't want to support Makita by buying more defective batteries but what do you do? If you have purchased these batteries and have had a problem please write a review. Maybe Makita will do something if they get enough bad reviews. People that rarely use these are probably the ones that gave the good reviews.
1,do not buy from them they sent me an open package of used makita batteries,this is my first time ordering from this web site and probably the last time i ordered 2 new makita batteries and got open package with used ones ...
2,"Long life between charges, but had to replace more often","We normally buy Dewalt cordless tools, but when we find deals, we will buy other brands and we figured we'd give the Makita's a try.The pluses: these batteries do last longer between charges than the old Dewalts nicads we had. If we have 2 guys doing the same job, the Dewalt would lose its charge in 3 hours, while the Makita would last at least 3.5 hours doing the same job.The downside...the batteries cost you more in the long run. They aren't cheap, and they do last longer between charges, but we seem to have to buy new replacement Makita batteries more often than we do for our Dewalt products.So, these batteries are great in that they are probably the longest running 18v cordless batteries we have had for our tools, but in the long run we probably won't stick with them because they need to be replaced every 4-6 months (we use them everyday), while our 'other' branded batteries are lasting almost a year under the same workload."
1,More bad batteries,"I am not somebody thats writes a lot of reviews, but I have to warn people about these batteries. I have had two batteries go bad after a year, Now I have a Makita five piece kit with one battery that will go bad soon I'm sure.I can not replace them after reading all the bad reviews. Stay away from Makita battery tools!"
4,mandatory equipment,"These batteries are important if you own a makita li-ion set. With the supplied two batteries you have to switch a single battery among the tools you are using while the second battery is charging, agrhh. This was very annoying when you are trying to make money on the job site. Armed with four batteries you can run three tools while one is charging, now you can make money!"
5,no problems yet,makita makes great batteries quick to charge and have not noticed drop off in life as the batteries get older sure they break but for the amount of abuse i put them through im shocked that they last as long as they do. the last set i bought served me two hard use years. i run my makita tools almost everyday and never regret my purchase.
4,Excellent batteries,"These are hands down the best batteries I've ever used in cordless tools. And I've used almost all of 'em. Dewalt, Milwaukee, Hitachi, Porter Cable, Hilti, and these 18V Makitas easily last the longest. They run tools that other manufacturers require 24V or 28V. I won't give any battery 5/5 stars, because none of them have a long enough life for the high price. Since I have no complaints about the quality of these batteries, they get 4/5."
1,Not Good,The batteries have Very short lives!No way to fix defective battery chip.I have not been able to find a substitute battery or substitute charger.
1,"Worked well, then both died","I had a tool set with these batteries for about a year with no issues what so ever, despite regular use. After I did not use them for about six months, neither of the batteries would charge or provide any power to speak of. Now I have a set of four tools that would be cheaper to replace altogether than to buy new batteries. Both bateries were disconnected from the tools while not in use. I'm not sure why they died, but I would not purchase them again due to the replacement cost."
4,Great batteries,These were a good price for two batteries. I have a bunch of 18 volt Makita stuff and if you really are going cordless nothing is worse than running out of juice and having to winch out the corded tools. They hold a charge very well between uses and have survived quite a few drops.
5,Dependable,"I have used many other lithium rechargeable batteries before... one or two of the other brand's batteries have died unexpectedly for unknown reason (no longer take a full charge). These Makita batteries however have not faulted. I have 6 of the smaller 1.5Ah versions of these batteries and all are working great and deliver plenty of power. I ordered these 3.0Ah batteries mainly for the Makita LXT angle grinder which really chews through the battery power. Thes ebatteries have delivered that extra power and are a great addition to your Makita range should you use the cordless tools that generally demand a bit more battery capacity (grinder, reciprocating saw, circular saw etc)."
5,"Powerful, quick charging batteries!","Take about 30 minutes to charge and last a long time, even on my recip saw or circular saw."
4,good luck i guess,"Maybe ive been lucky but ive owned lxt line of tools for past 3 years and am only now seeing one of batteries start to fail, I use them on recipricating saw, hammerdrill/driver, impact driver on regular basis for work and keep two chargers goin at once. just now bought another two batteries, hope they last as long my first pair."
1,Did not fit my 2002 Ford Windstar,"Did NOT fit my 2002 Ford WindstarIt is made from a very durable material, but....Despite checking the Felpro website and using the Amazon vehicle selector, this transmission gasket is not the same as my old one, nor does it fit.It is too short and too narrow.I had to clean up and reuse the old gasket.So far no leaks, but I would like to find a source for an EXACT replacement next time.I will attempt to return to Amazon."
5,Love this clock!!,I ordered this clock as a gift for my best friend who loves the Wizard of Oz and is a collector. He loved it!!! Thank you so much!
2,wizard of oz clock,"I have ordered two of these clocks. My classroom is the Wizard of Oz, so it looks great in the classroom. It does not keep time well. Every morning I have to reset the time. I have changed batteries countless times. I will not buy another one."
2,Graphics Resolution Was Disappointing,"I liked the water sounds in the video, but was quite disappointed in the resolution full screen. The scenes are too cluttered also. Glad I didn't pay too much for it."
2,Ugh...,"It is such a shame that this CD is composed of poor songs. A few, such as Will I seem to have an uplifting beat, but generally, this CD is not all that good. As a tip, i would advise you download the songs on [local website] and see if thay are even worth your money to buy. Why pay for a CD with like 25 songs, when only 3 or so are even worth your time!?"
2,2003? OLD SONGS/BAD MIXING,"Wow, where do I begin? First of all this is by far THE worst dance compilation I have ever heard. I could of mixed this better on my computer. Better on my turntables. DJ Sammy needs to stick to what he is a little better at.... cliche dance songs for the masses. If there was at least some songs on the 2 cds worth playing again I would of given a higher rating. Do not buy this cd unless you like old songs and bad mixing."
2,OLD,I have heard most of the songs on the radio for several months now. If you want something good and new get the MOS The Annual 2003(Import) to get the newest and best.
1,not what was pictured,"I ordered this item because I wanted exactly what was pictured-- the square casserole dish with a Magnolia. All views showed the same dish. The magnolia has special significance-- so the geranium dish that arrived was totally unsatisfactory. Now, not only will this gift be late, but I have no assurance if I order again that I will get what I want."
1,never received what I ordered!,I ordered the square dish to replace an old one I had broken. What I received was a Portmarion CLOCK! Be careful when you order non-book items on Amazon. It takes a long time to receive your money back!
4,very satisfied,Found this book very interesting. It's an eye-opener about the situation at that period of time. All people should know what happened at that time.
4,Love this Rocking Horse!,"Bought this rocking horse for my 15 month old for Christmas and we are loving it. Took him a day to warm up to it, he was petting it like he pets our family cats, so we figured he thought it was alive. Took him only a few tries to learn how to get himself on and off of it. The neck gives a tiny bit under adult pressure, and I'm not sure if it moves when you put batteries in it (I have enough noise in the house, so we opted not to install them). But other than that it is very sturdy. I stood on it and rocked to show my son what it did and was extremely impressed with how sturdy it was. Would highly recommend.Melissa & Doug Plush Rocking Horse"
1,Disappointment,"I purchased this horse for my 3 year old son because this company's products are generally of good quality. This is not one of the their good products!! One of the legs ripped while we tried to fit the horse on the base (the legs are not spread enough for the base). Also, the saddle could not be any worse quality -- plastic that will surely rip next time the batteries are changed. The only good thing is the realistic horse sounds. Overall, go somewhere else to get a beautiful rocking horse for your child."
2,product came damaged,I did not open this package until Dec.22nd because I trusted Melissa & Doug's products. The wooden base of the rocking horse had to be reassembled with wood screws. Several of the bolts holding the platform to the rocker were stripped out and the planks were not attached at one end. My husband had to drill new holes and use screws and glue to put it together.If I had opened this earlier I would have sent it back.
5,LOVE IT,"My nephew is one and I got this for him for Christmas. It arrived exactly when they said it would even though it was only a few days before Christmas. As soon as it was put together he jumped on. The sounds are adorable and not annoyingly loud, and its very soft. It rocks back and forth just enough but not enough to rock to far back. It is very attractive and looks like a toy he will be passing on to his children. The only thing that you should know is that its a little scrawny and not as ""chubby"" as most rocking horses you see. That was not a problem at all and it is VERY sturdy. If it can survive a day with my nephew, its a good quality toy. SOO glad I bought this at the price was a steal. They are more than double the price of Amazon at other retailers. Very impressed with the quality of Melissa and Doug toys."
3,Not sure what I think?,"I was very excited to get this toy. My 17 year old put it together in 10 minutes. Very cute beautiful wood like the sound. I have a 34 month old this is very excited to ride it since Christmas, but the other day I noticed the head and neck was pushed downward, so I pulled it up and now every time my son rides it he pushes down again, so I read all the reviews and don't see anyone else mention this.....so....is this a problem ???? Anyone else know, I left a message for the company, no one answered."
3,too much trouble,"Melissa & Doug,rear leg attaching was almost nightmare w cross threading possibility, other than that it was a nic product"
4,Nice rocking horse.,I was pleased with the rocking horse however I was disappointed that there were no screws provided to attach the horse to the base.
3,Melissa & Doug Rocking Horse,"The horse itself was very soft and nice. However, it didn't come with the 4 bolts to attach the horse to the rocker. Tried to get bolts - wasn't able to - so returned the whole thing. Ended up buying a cheaper rocking horse from Walgreens, as part of the Christmas toys they have in December. Would recommend - but need bolts and I don't like to assemble stuff."
3,"Still the best book of Grant photos, but be wary","This is a decidedly mixed bag, but worth a purchase if you're interested in Ulysses Grant. Published in 1966, Frost's book remains, sadly, the best book of Grant photos. I say ""sadly"" because there are a wealth of fabulous images not inside this book. Frost also mis-dates dozens of photos and even has the nerve to include two photographs which aren't even of Grant, and identifies the unknown man as Grant. Give me a break.The text is incidental, not especially interesting, and contains factual gaffes of some magnitude. For a beginner, this is a good introduction, but be wary of the dates assigned to each photo. And be especially aware that the fat man in the bankers suit is not Ulysses Grant, even though Frost claims he is.God knows when a decent book of Grant photographs will come down the pike. I've been holding my breath for 35 years for this eventuality and still see nothing on the horizon. One of these days, let's hope..."
4,Hate Me - Blue October,"Being a huge acoustic fan, I had to pick up this version of Blue October's ""Hate Me"". Either version is a must have if you like this song. A great, sad, song written with tremendous feeling and passion. Even through all of its heartache, it is beautiful. A song that didn't get enough credit or notoriety for its soul substance. I don't mean air play saturation either."
4,Mellow Bass Music,"I think this is one of the best CD's has came out from Bass Lo-Ryders, the other ones are a lil to fast. I just listened to the sample here but I am going to order this one."
1,Miami Bass,"Bass Lo-Ryders put together this lp of instrumentals entitled Strictly For Da Bassheadz. Out of the twelve songs / instrumentals on here, only four are solid. The problem with the other is the changing within each song that doesn't seem to fit the direction. All of the songs have heavy bass and good drum tracks, but the melodies overshadow the beats."
4,pooper scooper,"Pretty good net. I don't use it for fish, but it sure does the job for getting kid poop out of the tub, which was the reason I bought it. I assume it would work for getting anything out of water."
2,Way too big!,This net is absolutely huge. I really shouldn't have purchased it. I nearly killed one of my fish trying to get them out of it when I was cleaning the tank. Don't buy this unless you have HUGE fish.
2,closed caption,"I agree with Carlo about the sub titles; I have to search every British movie or series for cc before I can buy it and it eliminates a lot of good programs. My husband is hard of hearing and this is expensive for one disc, without the closed caption. Acorn is especially bad on this score & as soon as I see ""Acorn"" I go on to the next one. I can't decide whether to purchase this DVD or wait until there is an inexpensive used one for saleWe have the entire series and really enjoy Frost--with sub titles--and have watched them over again many times. It is really sad that the company couldn't have added cc."
4,Traffic Jam At Boulder Pass,"This is a review for OUTLAWS OF BOULDER PASS (1942) dby Sam Nuefield.......... MUSIC FROM HIS THROAT, DEATH FROM HIS GUNS! AND BORDER BADMEN RUN TO COVER AS THIS FELLOW RIDES THE RANGE..............Gil Harkness, played by veteran bad guy I. Stanford Jolley, controls Boulder Pass and is overcharging tolls for ranchers who need to get through the natural built bottleneck. Tom Cameron, as The Lone Rider, played by George Houston, robs the toll takers to return the money to the ranchers but is caught by Harkness and has to figure a way out of the mess.George Houston is a pretty interesting hero and this is a entertainingly decent ""B"" Western featuring the likes of Dennis Moore, Al ""Fuzzy"" St. John, Charles King and Marjorie Manners.I give this enjoyable ""B"" western, OUTLAWS OF BOULDER PASS, Four Stars."
3,Pass on Outlaws of Boulder Pass,"Specifically regarding Alpha Video's DVD release of Outlaws of Boulder Pass w/When A Man's A Man. This is a typical Alpha release which means adequate if nothing else is available.The source print for Outlaws is a soft, 16mm dupe with many dark shots or scenes even during outdoor daylight. There are intermittent missing frames and much surface noise. However, this PRC released film is somewhat rare with George Houston as the Lone Rider. The second feature from Atherton Productions also is obscure. However, the source print was in better condition than Outlaws but is slightly soft while the stock shots are very soft. There are some missing frames and light to moderate surface noise.I don't think these two films on one disc are worth more than one dollar plus shipping charges, especially since the film of greater interest is of poor quality."
4,Professional Baker-friendly Pastry Manual,"I haven't gone all the way through the book because it was a gift for my father and it's about recipes, but he took a baking course from Phillips and enjoyed it so immensely that I thought the book would be a good buy. After going through it, it seems that although it is not as user-friendly to us modern, common and untrained bakers, it has unique mass-pastry-baking recipes that I have not seen anywhere else. The recipes seem accurate (to my knowledge of baking), and I think it will come in very useful when I have large quantities of baking to do (and large vats to put the ingredients in). It has other things (bread for instance) besides pastry as well. All in all, I'd rate it four stars for the unique instructions contained there-in.Includes real-life pictures."
3,This Album Is Weakerthan The Rest,"Of all the bands in Canada, The Weakerthans could be the Great White North's best musical product. They've certainly influenced me musically, showing that the lyrics don't really have to make sense, or even fit. They're almost the definition of what Indie rock should be. Of course, that's their later albums, in their debut however, they create a new genre, Folk-punk. It's certainly something along the lines of original, but the problem is that the album is mostly throw it up against the wall and hope it sticks. Some of it works, but most of it seem to be an unintelligible mess of ideas that don't work. And after awhile, it all starts sounding the same.Granted, it's their debut, and it a very raw demo-like quality to it, but while it breaks some musical ground, it's anything but the sometimes brilliant work the band put out in their succeeding albums.Real Score: 2.5"
5,buy it,"the weakerthans are awesome. they have lyrics that actually make you think. imagery, metaphor, allegory all the elements of an epic poem. few artists around now can capture what they've managed to."
1,I would give this 0 stars if I could,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I watched it for the 2nd time a few years ago (now that I am an adult, the first time I saw it I was a child) and it was so bad that my friends and I could barely stand to watch it sober and wished we had turned the viewing into some sort of drinking game. In short, I can't believe that this was actually released to DVD, what is this world coming to?"
3,Good overview for the experienced user,the book is fine for people in a course studying the Unix OS. For an end user just wanting to get their feet wet it is a little advanced. I found the general information to be helpful but a little more explaination would be needed. Overall it is well laid out but too advanced.
3,This is a roller ball mouse--not optical,Buyers should be aware: This is a roller ball mouse--not optical.It's fine for an optical mouse...but why would anyone want one of those?
3,Early De Funes,"An earlier De Funes movie. It's all in French - no subtitles- unless you understand French - don't bother.It's a light, refreshing light early comedy, but not what you would expect as De Funes in Rabbi Jacob. This is a very early movie in B&W.; I don't regret buying it even though there are better De Funes movie choices."
5,One of the best dictionaries that I've found,This is one of the best dictionaries that I've found. The thing I really like about this dictionary is the word derevations. Most of the popular dictionaries these days have little or no information on where the word originated and what its original meaning is. Nice work Webster's New World Dictionary. I've been a fan for years. Keep up the good work.
5,I loved it :),"For me I liked that it seemed brand new, it hadn't been read thouroghly anyway. However there was a little friendly star drawn on one page which was only to please me :) I don't know how others would like it but I loved it :)"
4,Pretty good,"This book is great for creating scenes. It saved me some cash because I could develop the scene myself, instead of buying a scene online.The one criticism is that it gives very specific tutorials for generating several scenes. But it doesn't have a general discussion of techniques."
1,No tutorials in the Kindle Edition,"It is not mentioned (yet) in the item's description, but no tutorials are included in the Kindle Edition of the book. This means if you plan ordering it, you should better think of the printed version, as the Kindle version is useless."
3,Not for Beginners,"Although this book is extremely detailed and specific, if you don't understand the terms the author is explaining, you will be completely lost. When I first bought this book, I wasn't familier with the material editor at all, and the instructions this book gave were another language to me. Now that I've had some proper training with 3DS Max in some of my classes, I can understand what the book is talking about. This book is for intermediate or above users. Not a beginner book, but still excellent. I only give it three stars to attract the attention of people thinking this is a beginner book. Other than that, I highly recommend this for conditioned 3D artists."
5,INHERITORS OF THE STORM,"This is probably my most favorite book. It was well written and even though I did not grow up in this time period, I find it interesting.I have spent a considerable amount of time over the years trying to find out who the author was.At the back of the book it was stated that Victor Sondheim was a pen name. If anyone has info on the real author I would like to know.He must be dead or the sequal would have been written."
1,It didn't work - even after I had a service person come to our home,it didn't work - even after I had a service person come to our home It was more trouble then it was worth
2,Didn't Work,I knew the price on this item was to good to be true. But they did take it back and I was credited promptly. I'm going to order another and we'll see what happens. Everyone deserves a 2nd chance.
5,good quality!,"Wonderful product, good solid quality!I would recommend itNot a flimsy cheap looking, and the kids use it also"
1,Lack of information,"This book is excellent. It lacks the information that Richard Wagner was a SS member and a fanatic nazy party member. After the war he escaped from Nuremberg trials to Paraguay, where he composed his last opera ""Parifal"". All the other information in this book is absolutely correct and real."
5,techno/electronica remixes-- very cool & underground,"The best way I could describe this cd is it sounds like a really cool score from a techno anime movie... the remixes on this cd range from hard tech to fun electronica... if you like electronica and anime, you'll love this cd..Beta's mix of Natsu Kikyuu is definitely my favorite on the cd.. Nigel Richard's and Prozac's tracks are very cool too."
1,Don't be burned on J-pop by this album,"This and the first Anime Toonz are a horrid example of anime music. The tracks are jarring, poorly executed remixes, that bear almost no resemblance to the original songs.Yet another attempt to scam people out of money for a shoddy product.Get the real thing. be amazed."
3,If you like anime and/or familiar with Maria Kawamura this is for you!,"Maria Kawamura is a well known voice actress/singer in Japan. The last tracks are really nothing more than her saying things in english in a Japanese accent which is cute. The beats sometimes are slightly off which does bother me, but this is the mixer's fault not the singer. But if you like anime or know japanese or just like music with words that make no sense to you with a good beat this is for you."
4,The last 19 are dumb,"The first CD was cool. And on theis one I like all the songs when the are singing but this one is good but not great. The last 19 just have girls saying hi, hello, hallo hallo, and stuff like that. So get the first one then if your cazy for more then get this CD. And one more thing, I love #11 :]"
1,Worst Book Ever.,"I was required to read this book for school, I chose Hush out of four other books because the first few pages made it look interesting. I thought it looked like a strong plot, I couldn't have been more wrong. I read the first 7 chapters in one day and hated it. It was very strange how she'd talk about a irrelevant subject for a paragraph and then switch to another pointless topic. Like, she'd start talking about her father and 3 sentences later switch to talking about her sisters room and the pink ""girls rock"" poster on her wall. From the start of the book it was really bad and it didn't get any better if anything it got worse. Evie talked about how unhappy she was for the entire book, I really don't understand why this is rated so highly when nothing happened throughout the entire book. They moved and where depressed and at the end less depressed but still unhappy. Overall this book shouldn't get a rating it's that bad. Overall? AWFUL!"
3,Hard 2 understand BRIANNA,"It doesn't really grasp my attention and is mostly pretty boring. It doesn't have any good describing words or details! It could've explained more like where they were even living when they moved or could have gave more details. It would grasp my attention for a paragraph or two and make me want to read more, but then it would get boring and lose it. They keep it very mysterious at some points!"
3,Hush!! Nathan Agnews review,"Hi, my name is nathan of first hour of Ms. Hensons class. Im going to tell you about an interresting book Hush!! Hush is a really interresting book but it had some turn on and offs about it. First of all I got kind of lost in it first there talking about how they were in denver and then talked about something else. The story goes like this a black family witnesses a murder of two white cops off duty killing ablac kid.So they testify and they have to go into hidding because of racsism so they talk about moving schools and every thing. Adults and teens would like this because it is very advanced and talks about racsism."
2,Hush,"A nice book but I was very disappointed with the ending. It doesn't answer any questions you have throughout the book. A good, nice read but not very exciting."
2,HUSH Devin Riffe,"Hush is a interesting book but it wasn't but it really what I was looking for. The people that would like this book would be people who like suspience books. I didn't like it very much because the ending left me hanging and I don't like books like that. I read some book reviews before I read it and I thought It would be great but I was wrong. I think it would have been better if there was alittle more action, because personaly I like action books. But it wasn't all bad there were a couple good parts to it to. But for the most part it was bad so if you want a good book think twice about this book."
4,NO PLACE LIKE HOME,"A voluminous book made for a fanaminal read is HUSH. This book tells a story about a young girl and her family, they are ecstatic of where they live,Denver. Their policeman father is determind to yeild all people and spread peace. Then one day her wittnesses a murder,not just any murder. His two policeman friends siez a young african-american boy out of nowhere! Next when he has to make a very important decision:""Does he testify or not?""..."
2,madison c's book review for hush mrs.hensons first period,"Hush was my book.it is about a family that is black and alot of bad thing happen to them, just because of racism. it is also about police officers. the girl Toswiah is going through a hard time because they had to move and leave every thing the knew behind, their lifes totally change in this book.i did not like the book that much because i thought it talked about her feelings to much. it was kind of boring it did not hold my attention, it kind of left me hanging at the end too.i fell like i read it for nothing but a grade. i guess it was not my type of book.a person who i think would like this book would be a person that likes to hear about peoples feelings and likes to read sad books.i think that kind of person would like to read this book because that is what i thought it was about.thank you for reading my book report."
4,Good Book,"The book was a dramatic mystery about a girl who at a young age has to join the witness protection program. Her father witnesses a murder and everyone tries to defend the murderers because they were police officers. and for his family's life he has to move away, even change their names."
4,A Shark Lover's Dream,"With more pictures than you can wave a frozen tuna at and enough detail about the adventures behind their creation to make Cousteau jealous, this tome on the wolves of the sea will satisfy the shark fan in your life. The chapter on the Great White Shark was my particular favorite with pictures lifelike enough to make me reconsider my upcoming dive trip to South Africa. In fact, the best compliment I can give this book is that the nightmares I have about sharks are illustrated with pictures from this book!"
1,"Not worth the $$, doesn't last!!","I bought this lamp along with a replacement bulb in Jan 2010. It definitely worked well, but 7 months later, (july 2010) it stopped working - just wouldn't turn on. I tried changing the bulb but still didn't work. There is a 2 year warranty, but it will cost $40. to send it to CA. not worth the time, $$, or hassle. Conclusion: Don't buy this one!!!"
2,cheap item,"This is the second EZ reader I have purchased. They both were cheaply made; and even though the directions to assemble them are easy to follow, the product iteself does not assemble well. This last one is tilted because the threads do not match up. I have tried to remedy it a couple of times by disassembling and assembling it again to no avail."
1,Danger...base catches on FIRE,"Bought this lamp in a store and after a short time the base caught on fire. After I unplugged it and let it cool, I removed the black plastic plate on the bottom and a black box with wires going into it was melted. I am so glad it did not occur while we were sleeping.The short time it was working, it did work well. I got quite upset and threw the lamp out...so sorry I did that since I now realize I should have sent it back to the manufacturer or wholesaler. BUT, even had it been replaced, I would not dare to use one of these again - my home does not need to burn down from a lamp."
2,It is broken after 2 months,"I have bought the same lamp before and it has been working fine. For this time, it is broken after 2 months and I didn't even use it very often. I have good experiences with these lamps before so I decided to buy another one. However, it is broken so soon. I tried to change the light bulb and it is still not working. I'm very disappointed."
1,The worst piece of Chinese crap I ever bought.,"I bought two of these, and both have burned up the ""ballast"".While you can't expect great quality at this price, why Amazon keeps selling this is beyond me.If you do purchase this (or the other models by Grandrich), be prepared to replace this poorly designed/constructed circuit board.The company should be hit with a class action suit, in my opinion."
3,"Good for Reading, White Light","This lamp provides good light for reading. However, the light produced is white and can be rather harsh if looking at it directly. This is a big contrast to softer yellow light from conventional bulbs. The price was decent for comparable products."
4,?,"These are excellent reading lamps. My 2 year old lamp burnt out, [not the lamp bulb itself, but the electronics in the lamp base], could not locate parts,so purchased a new lamp from you, + 2 sets of electronic replacement units, just in case they burn out again. Your overnite delivery was a godsend, certainly appreciated it. I am a happy camper otherwise.Joe Nagy."
2,Not exactly sunlight,"This lamp is advertised to simulate sunlight. I have full-spectrum bulbs that really do illuminate like the sun, but this isn't one of them. In fact, the replacement bulb simply states ""fluorescent"" on the packaging--nothing about sunlight simulation.I had wanted light that was both useful and healthy, but this lamp doesn't deliver. On the plus side, I'm able to see my work well enough at night. But after a while the light hurts my eyes. After just a couple of months it's time to look for a replacement."
1,Grandrich EZ reader lamp #ES-101N,Very disatisfied with this product. It worked for about 1 week (oI only turned it on 2 times) then it stopped. I ordered a new bulb which will not work in the lamp. I have another Grandrich table lamp that works fine.
1,Lamp was good while it lasted,"This lamp was good while it lasted. After having it for about 6 months the bulb finally went out. I replaced the bulb but the lamp started flickering which was very annoying. The flickering would come and go but otherwise the lamp seemed to be back to normal but the flickering got worse over about a 2 month period. The finally I was reading and the lamp seemed to get dimmer, all of a sudden and finally went out. Changing bulbs didn't nothing, the lamp simply wouldn't light. Lamp was made in China. I guess it will go into the trash along with the spare bulbs I bought. The lamp lasted less than a year so I can't recommend it."
3,Short life span,"I must say that while my light bulb lasted a whole 2 weeks it was great! I have tried replacement bulbs from Lowes that are the same wattage and they don't seem to work in mine or my mothers. Although, I did not purchase my two lights from amazon I am very disappointed that the light didn't last very long at all. My mom's light bulb busted (Her fault) and we tried a replacement which didn't work. And mine Blew out after only 2 hours of usage time. I would love to buy another lamp all together because I am beginning to think the actual lamps I purchased were faulty."
4,fluorescent lamp,this product is what it's advertised to be. at first the rather cold fluorescent lighting was a little strange but i got used to it and now i like it.
1,Floor Lamp,Lamp fell over and never worked gain. Replacement bulb did not work.Terrible quality lamp. I'll never buy from Grandrich again.This is a no Star product.Not recommended
5,Thanks for the book,this is a great book on older engine technology. if you have an older vehicle and want to understand more of the items you have this is it.
4,The best Houston guidebook SO FAR...,"As a visitor, I found Houston to be an amazing, sprawling, quirky, fascinating city. Practically impossible to navigate-- the road maps seem to be printed upside down! Thus any guidebook has its work cut out for it. What I liked about this one, however, was it's enthusiasm. It seems to have been written by people who really love their city and are trying to convey some of the local flavor. It does try to be both a tourist's AND a resident's guide, but the casual visitor may not notice or be bothered by the misinformation and typos that upset my fellow reviewer. I particularly like the clean, modern design and the system of indicating where on the map grid the various places are located. At least this gives one a CLUE!"
2,Disappointing,Overall the book was a big disappointment for me. Conversation between characters was stilted; little to no action - underless you consider Jessica running from one part of the ship to another as action. She spent a lot of time going around in circles meeting people in different parts of the ship. The real crime solver was Jess's new friend Mary. Jessica seemed to be along for the ride and cashing in on her fame as a novelist to get people to do what Mary suggested. My suggestion is to watch the TV for re-runs of this beloved series and save your money. Definitely overpriced for the quality.
2,The weakest of the series,"I have 2 more books to go and I'll have completed the series until the new one comes out in 2013. I mention this to show that I am a real fan of these books. I know they're ""corny"" and poorly edited, but they're a guilty pleasure. This one was the weakest of the series for me. Jessica usually isn't so pedantic that she continuously corrects people over word usage as she does in this book: it's not a ""cruise; it's a crossing."". Also, I don't think Jessica would have made the play used to ferret out the murderer a comedy. She doesn't take murder lightly. (This isn't a spoiler; I didn't mention who the murderer was.)Jessica refers to Mary (a mystery buff Jessica befriends on the ship) as Watson to Jessica's Sherlock, while it really was the other way around. Mary runs rings around our Jessica in the clue department. I wouldn't suggest not reading this book; just don't expect much."
3,Jessica Fletcher on the QE2,"Angela Landsbury fans may not be aware that our favorite lady lives on in print as well as in reruns. It was a pleasant surprise for me. I bought it in the first place as the perfect gift for a British war bride given a trip home for a wedding anniversary. I missed the date because I opened it before wrapping!It is told in the first person, includes discovery of a body in a lifeboard, plenty of suspects and so much description about the QE2 that it makes a wonderful gift for someone who has traveled on it and for landlubbers who still dream of it."
4,Wonderful documentary on a great actress,"This was a very nice, well put together documentary of Audrey Hepburn. They have so many of the great people who've worked with her and those who were her close companions. It's a really nice insight of the great actress through the eyes of her friends/co-stars. PLUS, there are many interview clips of Audrey Hepburn, herself that I have never seen before. Audrey never really enjoyed talking about her life, but when she started working with UNICEF, Audrey thought it was a good idea to put herself out in the public so attention will be drawn on UNICEF and the countries they've helped.Though the clips and interviews with these prominent people are rare and genuine, the quality of the sound and picture fall by the way side. For this, one star was taken off of my rating, but other than that, great buy.Recommended to: Audrey Hepburn fans and Gregory Peck fans."
4,Hollywood cover story,"General overview without a lot of unique details. Seen it all before. However, Audrey Hepburn is a wonderful subject to visit anytime you get the chance. Try to find the A&E Biography version DVD/VHS."
3,I was on a Ammo Ship off Viet Nam,"I was on a ammunition ship off Viet Nam as well. I think the author did a pretty good job except for a couple of things. He used the term RAMF (rear action MF) when it was actually REMF (rear escolon (sp) MF). He referred to Thai Currency as something other than what it is (Baht). I know, I'm in Thailand at the moment and have been married to a Thai for 32 years.Toward the end of the book he almost tried to sound like he was a snakeeater (someone who spends lots of time in the jungle) most likely a special forces guy while he actually (like me) served on a Navy Ship off the coast with mostly hot meals and a dry place to sleep.Other than the items indicated above it was a good read."
1,Work of fiction,"I served on the USS Rainer AE-5 from 1967 to 1970,the period of time covered in this book,where I started in deck division and eventually became a gunnersmate with the rank of GMG3.I can unequivocally state that the facts and events presented in this book are---well let's just be kind and say BS.The book in my opinion is not worth the read, especially if you want an accurate account of life on an ammo ship during the Vietnam period.If books had a warranty,I would ask for my money back."
4,Striker Plates,"Product is O.K., but wish the opening would have been a little longer, because I have a house that expands & contracts everytime it rains, as well as settling."
5,outstanding,"Outstanding book: fun to read, great vignettes of their various trips, makes possible what I thought was impossible, camping in any winter weather."
1,Bad remake...,"This is so bad I can't even go into it. Essentially, a politically correct take on terrorism through the eyes of an 8-year-old. But what I really wanted to say is that there's a movie from 1999 called THE TERRORIST that had the same basic idea, only it is gritty, believable, and poignant. It really seems like the director of DNDN tried to remake that film and failed miserably."
1,i wanted to like this movie,"as my heading says i wanted to like this movie. i read the description and i thought it sounded good, however upon watching it it seems that the director had to fill time. i mean at least 30 minutes of this film is boring. let's watch her bathe, shave, eat, cut toenails and fingernails. i'm serious. then you get to the plot which is somewhat interesting but, your left with the worst ending in cinema history. no explination, no resolution, and let's be honest did the makers just run out of film. i mean there is really no ending. maybe i'm missing the point but this film could have been great but instead pass it by. at least i saw it on the sundance channel rather than paying for it."
2,A Movie that Can't Make Its Point,"My wife almost kicked my butt for wasting two hours of her life watching this movie. She was a great sport, but I can certainly understand how she feels.When you watch the movie, you feel like your caught in a loop. Two minutes into the movie you have a broad brush idea of the plot. You think to yourself, ""Yeah, here comes the action!"" Nope. The movie, for the most part, stays in low gear for the entire duration.It's a movie that has ideas that are more interesting to discuss than it is to watch. It squanders action and forward momentum. In summary, I'd like to thank my wife for being too hard on me. I really wanted to watch this movie, but I too lost two hours of my life."
3,Disappointed,"This movie was a disappointment. Being a Clooney fan, it just didn't get it done this time. Not enough goat staring"
3,Men who Stare At Goats,"The Men Who Stare At GoatsWas a strange movie. It was ok, but not as good as some of the other movies that George Clooney has been in."
2,"""Digital Copy"" is WMV only! Mac users beware!","The movie is decent. This review is for the purchase here at Amazon. I make it a practice to only buy Blu-Rays on sale or with digital copies. That's because I have a massive library on Apple TV (and now on iPad) that my family uses to watch movies in our family room (when not in the home theater). So why on earth would a studio release a digital copy that only works on either Mac or PC??!! And why isn't this CLEARLY disclosed since this exclusivity is the exception, not the rule??!! I now have a useless wmv that won't play on Mac or iTunes. I would never have purchased this if this was clear. No wonder people resort to piracy. Only buy this if you don't care about digital copies or are PC only."
1,Walked out of this one in the theater.,HORRIBLE MOVIE.NOT FUNNY. BORING.NO REAL STORY.I WAS WITH A GROUP OF 8 PEOPLE AND ALL OF US HATED IT SO MUCH THAT WE LEFT THE THEATER. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. IT WAS SO BAD I THINK A LARGE PORTION OF BRAIN CELLS DIED WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE. THANKS GEORGE C. FOR A TERRIBLE AFTERNOON!
1,I hated it!,"Am I so dumb that I didn't get it? What is this movie all about? It is a joke,it has to be. It seems like nobody took their carriers seriously when they agreed to be part of this junk. It is awful! While watching, I spent most of time giving it five extra minutes to see if it would get better. But it didn't. Is it a comedy? NOPE. Is it a drama? NAH. Is just a waste of time, a disappointment, a bad joke."
4,Excellent Film - Well Acted,"An excellent film with fine acting and a very good story. Worth more than one viewing. Both video and audio are high quality. Video has excellent depth to the image and good color fidelity. PCM audio is top quality. Rear channels add dimension but not much else. This is a surprisingly good movie, something of a sleeper that deserves a higher rating than generally given by the critics. You will most likely talk about this film after you see it. If you enjoyed ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou,"" you will enjoy ""The Men Who Stare At Goats."" Recommended. (Viewed on 1080p, 120hz screen; audio KEF Reference and Sequerra T1 speakers, with appropriate cables and electronics.)"
1,Men Who Stare at Goats,Wasted time watching this film; you really must have nothing to watch if you sit through this entire movie
1,Worst Movie in 2009,"Is there a zero rating, because this movie would be five under it. I can't say one good thing about this movie. It was a real disappoinment. I love George Clooney, but this is the worst movie he has ever done. It didn't end fast enough for me. It was long, boring, even ""Entertainment Tonight"" rated it as one of the worst movies of the year. I can't agree more. I hope this review saves all you possible future viewers from this movie. Don't waste your money or time on it."
4,Amusing Film About Psychic CIA,"I don't know how much truth is in this film but I can actually see the CIA trying this once upon a time. The premise is that during the ""tune out, drop acid"" time the military got very interested in cultivating esp powers. George Clooney was one of these agents who got in touch with his psychic powers. Present day Ewan McGregor gets to know him and introduced to him and all his looney buddies who still try and zone out. Jeff Bridges is one of the looniest. This was amusing for about an hour and then the one continual joke premise joke ran out of gas. If you need something light and amusing to watch, this is worth that. It is certainly NOT Dr. Strangelove though, not by a long shot!"
5,Funny and thought-provoking film. . .and more true than one would believe.,"Such an interesting movie, and probably not well-known, but Excellent viewing. I think I would have named the film something that would appeal more to women also. . .as it is not just a ""guy"" picture."
3,"Hard to follow at times, but interesting.","George Clooney and Ewan McGregor in the same film makes it automatically interesting. This movie is hard to follow at times, but it is interesting and makes some good points. There are some fun bits of dialogue which I won't share because it's better just to watch the film and experience it for yourself. - There's also a book. I plan to read it at some point."
2,What is funny about this movie?,"I had fully expected, given the title and actors, to see a good knee-slapping film. What I saw was disappointing, boring and at times no plot whatso ever. I will say the cast was good but you can't make a silk purse out of a pig's ear, in this case a sorry and tiresome tale about nothing...."
4,the men who stare at goats,"this movie is great comedy drama doesnt have lot of special effects which im sick of since they look fake to me now, but its great story of people in ww2, trying to learn things about drugs and science of the mind. some will find it not there likeing but i did wish they make more like these. there is a touch of genius in the movie. morons wont get it"
1,AGGGGH......AWFUL,"The trailers were tantalizing, the list of stars was intriguing, the movie itself challenged my Dyson Vacuum in it sucking quality. Need I say more? I regret having wasted several hours of my life that I will never get back. I could have spent the time doing something more enjoyable, like shoving hot rusty mails into my eyes. I can not figure out why in anyone's name did George Clooney make this movie?"
3,Return of the Jedi,"This was a half-enjoyable movie. I'm not sure it said too much but then again, maybe it did. 3.5 stars."
2,So much potential but fell flat,"With a cast that has such a great history, we were quite disappointed in this movie. The previews showed all the best parts and were unrepresentative of the movie. The comedy was forced and the plot tenuous. So what was this movie all about? Was it supposed to be funny, dramatic, tragic? We now own it, but I doubt if we will ever watch it again. If you really want to watch this movie, buy a used copy or rent it."
1,the men who stare at nothing,"This movie is terrible. The only funny scenes are the ones that are in the trailer. Maybe if you were high, this movie would be better. It is pure nonsense and (another word to describe feces that begins with an ""s"" and end with a ""t"")."
1,Most overrated movie that I have seen in a LONG TIME,"I bought this DVD based upon the rave reviews that were published when it was first released. OMG! This is the worst piece of garbage that I had seen in years. It was so bad, that I could not force myself to watch the entire movie. I ejected it from my dvd player and promptly threw it out."
1,May be the worst movie I've EVER seen,"I just had to go see this movie due to the cast. I was expecting it to be funny but didn't expect much more. The film has little story, contrived plot if you can call it a plot, a dumb ending and was a general waste of time. I regreted watching it to the end."
1,Stupid funny...Stupid,"Even great actors and comedic actors couldn't make this movie smell better than goat's poo. Well two hours wasted. Pop corn was good. Oh and its attempt at even communicating what Iraq was, and is, didn't. I give the movie a liberal Naa-a-a-aa-ah."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,What a waste of time. I thought I would get a few good laughs from this movie and it put me to sleep. It's a shame I can't return it for a refund. A total waste of time and money. I hate to even give it one star but I had to check one to submit the review.
1,Just Awful,"I should have taken the previous reviews to heart. I thought it was impossible to be so bad, with all the talent in this movie. Trust me, it's worse than you think! WASTE OF MONEY!!!! (and time)"
2,War satire or excuse for a paycheck?,"MASH and Dr. Strangelove are classic war satires.War, Inc. and TMWSAG are 'lackadaisical' attempts at satirizing war.An effective satire requires sharp touches of black humor and biting social criticism, which are surely missing here. So, unless you rummage through this heap for the slightest hint of relevance, this is merely an example of big stars agreeing to make this picture as a favor, since they are not in need of quan. Aside from a couple side-splitting moments, this was pointless and dull, simple as that.Goverments have been known to invest in bizarre military training methods but the mockery has to be more polished than this clusterf**k to be amusing on film. Worth a peek for the most common French expression?"
2,"Didn't Deliver,sorry!","Great premise, great cast but didn't achieve greatness. The premise of many zany govt military conspiracy-plots being illuminated in one film, mated w/ pop culture/ urban legends is worthy of a film and fair game. Why not mix every Area 51-ESP-Astral Projection-Black Ops rumor into a movie then add supernatural comic book ideas? (Dim Mak death touch, walking thru walls etc).The real problem w/ trying to make an intelligent satirical movie is that folks who will understand intelligent satirical movies don't watch movies. Wry, crisp satire can burn a hole thru a book's pages but in a film it can fall flat. Super clever jokes often aren't sight gags and movies are visually dependent. George Clooney is a great actor who tries to make films of value; the intent was there but the vehicle failed. It reminds me of ""Syriana"" great premise, a lot of effort but it failed under it's own well intentioned weight.sorry,"
2,A lot of potential - gone wrong,"Here in this review I may appear hypocritical in view of my other defense against other low rated movie reviews - but so be it. My hypocrisy rests in that I read the book first and found the movie coming up short. This is hypocrisy since I understand many movies fall short of expectation to views entering a view with book entrenched in the mind.The movie, for me, was even hard to watch. I felt as if it was made quickly, too quickly and although it was a comedy there were some issues presented in the book as serious issues, modern political issues, that should have been dealt with better. They were not.There were parts of the move that had me in stitches and would not advise against ""ever"" watching this movie - but I wouldn't stay home missing a brilliant event in exchange.Perhaps you are better off if you don't read the book first BUT if you want to enjoy what I felt was a better story - read the book."
3,Meh,It's an interesting idea and I laughed now and again but I'll not likely watch it again. I'm not going to go into it but don't spend more than $5 for this movie--no reason to buy it on blu-ray either if you can get it on DVD for cheaper.
5,AWESOME!,"Awesome lineup in an awesome film. It was really funny without being a comedy, serious without becoming a drama. All in all a really well presented, well acted movie. One I will come back to and watch time and time again."
4,Very enjoyable,"I really enjoyed this film, in spite of several problems with the script (very thin and scattered) and the storyline (especially the contrived and undeveloped ending). Clooney is great in his role, and the rest of the cast provide some very unique performances that are fun to watch. What I most enjoy about the movie, though, is the fact that it never takes itself too seriously, even when aiming at important social issues, and that it never presents anything in black and white--every issue is presented in shades of grey that allow the viewer to think about things without being preached to. Every supposed criticism from one side is couched with a flaw in perception from that side that may or may not invalidate that criticism. The filmmakers don't try to explain anything in terms of right or wrong, but in terms of what may be right and what may be wrong; what may be true versus what may not be true. In that way, the film is highly enjoyable and entertaining."
4,Great cast & references,"Be 1 with the force!Tongue in cheek humor with great cast, but short on LOL humorI was falling asleep watching this movie - landscaping.Jeff Bridges hasn't gotten an Academy Award yet due to tired old hippee persona.Dude, not a typo, something serious so you get the award before you're old.You deserve it."
1,OMG !!!!,Well we couldn't wait to see it we tried several times to rent it and it was never available. SO one would assume it's got to be an awesome movie. Well as a surprise I bought it. BAD mistake !!! Now we own one of the worst movies ever. It was really hard to get into. We are movie buffs and love to watch all different kinds of movies but this was horrible.
1,Waste of Money and Time,"The book was fine. But this movie is one of the worstI have seen in a long time. Jeff Bridges was great inthe Big Lebowski, but this movie is a total waste of time andmoney."
1,Huh? Why?,"This one did nothing for me. Well, that's not true, it did temporarily break insomnia's hold on me. A solid cast but a weak story. Should be Zero stars."
1,Mac Users Beware,"Mac Users, don't buy this Blu-Ray for the Digital Copy, it is not Mac Compatible. Very Disappointing."
2,"a strange comedy, but then, this is Palin's america","This is a really weird film about the investigation by a mediocre reporter, of a group in the army that is trying to develop psychic powers that will enhance the security of the US. They concentrate to walk though walls, to kill (yes) goats by their vibes, to hear voices that will tell them where terrorism hostages are held. They are shut down, then gain new life in, you guessed it, the post-9/11 security culture. The thing about this is, in my view, it is not funny but so pathetically strange that the film is not fun to watch.The one strength of the movie is that the cast is outstanding, including McGregor, who is investigating a group that call themselves the Jedi!Not recommended. It simply doesn't quite work."
3,The Men Who Stare At Goats,This movie was alright. It just wasn't very funny or interesting. I might have laughed once throughout the movie.
1,Failed story,"The story, as it was delivered, failed to keep my attention or interest. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but it was difficult staying awake to watch it in its entirety."
4,Could have been better,"i was really looking forward to seeing this one. the trailers made the movie look hilarious. in the end, i have to admit it held my interest right through, but it could have been so much more.my biggest disappointment ? well going by the title and the trailer, i was expecting a good hour of quality goat-staring. in the end, we had about 20 seconds. i'm bitterly disappointed by that, but - as i am a grown adult - i won't let that taint my overall opinion of the movie too much.however, let it be said that seeing a timid hamster drop on its side may be amusing but it has no place in a movie called 'the men who stare at goats'. this role could have gone to another card-carrying goat. i bet that hamster doesn't even belong to a union !!"
3,Clooney Movie,quite slow. A silly concept that drags on a bit. More of a Jeff Bridges movie than a George Clooney movie.
4,child of the 60's?,"Well, I am. I'm wondering after reading the other reviews if anybody gets it? I loved this move, really funny. I got a huge kick out of this movie. IMHO I believe you should add this movie to your collection. I'm glad I did. PS I thought the end was good but a little like a Carlos Castaneda book. In fact, I thought the whole idea for the movie was taken from The Teachings of Don Juan but hey, that's just me.Bear"
4,I see a tin mug,"Personally, I find The Men Who Stared At Goats funny, but not Jack Black-funny or Will Ferell-funny, which is a good thing.I'm impressed that the stars of this show did not try outshine each other. Each played his part well. I am particularly tickled by George Clooney's and Kevin Spacey's acting.Job well done, soldiers."
4,Funny movie,"Seeing Clooney in hippie hair was classic and had me laughing in itself. This movie is funny in an undertoned way. I thought I wasn't going to like it from the bad critic reviews but suprisingly enough enjoyed it. I don't like in your face funny movies and this one has an undercurrent of comedy in it. This is a smart, funny movie movie!"
4,Much better than expected...,"Starz cable channel lists this as a ""dark comedy"" but I don't think I laughed even once during the film. Maybe dark comedy isn't my thing. None the less, despite not being funny the movie was quite entertaining and had a lot of interesting tidbits about Government activities in the 70's & 80's which included funding & researching the possible military application of psychic abilities like ""remote viewing."" For more information on this you can Google Project Jedi or Project Stargate.The film did go a little cheesy at the end, and if you are looking for a good laugh, you would probably be disappointed with this one, but there were many interesting avenues in the film if you are into psychic abilities and Government conspiracies, this one will entertain. By the way, nice element having Ewan McGregor play the one that is learning the way of the Jedi!Final Grade: B"
2,Disappointing,"I usually like off beat comedies like this. I think Clooney, Spacey, and McGregor are wonderful actors and I have enjoyed many of their movies. Everything pointed to me liking this movie, but I didn't. It could best be described as mildly amusing."
5,sound and sense,"I had an old paperback copy of this book while in college many many years ago. I had bought it used and it was pretty beat up, but I still read parts of it from time to time. I decided to get a hardback copy and was surprised to find it had been updated and re-issued 10 or 11 times since I graduated college.I am very pleased with the updates and with my new copy."
2,Not Perrine's Ninth Edition,"Instead of Perrine's Ninth Edition in good condition, I received Perrine's Seventh Edition. To an English teacher needing an extra book for students to use in class, the edition very much matters. Not only are the poems on different pages, some poems are not in the Seventh Edition that are in the Ninth Edition."
2,Motor will die,"I love this type gadget, and for the last few months it has kept me company at my desk. It is pretty neat to watch and is in a way soothing. I had one and its motor burned out. I got a second on, and for the last few months it has been running fine, but again, the motor burned out. I guesstimate the first one lasted about 300 hours and the second one lasted about 375 hours. I am unsure if I want to get a third. I am thinking of getting one and trying to run it 24/7 to see if this one burns out too after 300-400 hours. It is not like I abused it, nor was it running all the time, but I am disappointed in its quality."
2,not great,"This is not great. It is cheap, looks cheap, and works cheap. The noise level from it fluctuates from nice to too loud and would wake anyone up. The lights in it are either off or on. And when on they change colors...really fast! Nothing soothing about that at all. To think that I had to buy a usb plug adapter to use in the wall outlet for this junk makes me sad. I guess I will have to find something else for my son's room to use as a night light.Unfortunately, not a great buy."
4,Product Quality / Shipping Cost,"Product quality is excellent,first use was when I was in a health rehab center recovering from knee damage caused by a fall. Shiping cost was gross; it could have been shipped for less via first class postage rather then the method used, in my opinion."
1,Huh?,Product Description115-DW2003 Phillips Bit Tips Slotted Bit Tips Phillips Power Bits Double-Ended Bits Deck Bit Tips Slotted Power Bits Drywall Bit Tips Square Recess Bit Tips Square Recess Power Bits Unit Sold is in measure of 1 BitUnit Sold is in measure of 1 Package.No thanks.
4,"Yeah,this is the pen for me.","In my line of work i am constantly using a pen.This pen is a smooth Bold wrighter.My favorit part of this pen is the pocket clip:when you put your pen back in you'r pocket the clip retracts the tip if you forgot to.When you spend half of you'r work day w/ your pen in your hand you will love the ""Just the right size"" feel.My local convenient store carrys off brand refills that fit just fine.The only problam is if you bend the pocket clip the point will no longer stay out.I have a few of these pens just incase that happens,I tightly wrap a rubber band around the clip for a few weeks.This works to a degree,just make sure not to harsh you'r pocket clip. lol"
4,A good resource for simple machines and tools.,"This little book of investigations presents a variety of tools (e.g., hammer, screw) that we commonly encounter and illustrates how each is representative of a basic simple machine. The language is clear and easy to understand while applying physics concepts. I would most likely use it as a resource for teaching Applied Physical Science to students who might be difficlut to motovate to learn physics concepts. The appeal of learning about tools that are familiar may be a good motivational technique. If you're a pack-rat of teaching resources like me, you'll find useful information in this inexpensive resource."
4,Hilarious!,"If you are the type who loves dumb people doing dumb things, this is the anime for you. The characters are fun and memorable and the jinks are high, but this is no kids story. And there is very little in the way of over all plot besides the vague battling to make it to the top classroom, but that didn't bother me at all.Both my husband and I really enjoyed it. I'd definitely recommend."
2,A great show for perverts!,"This show has no useful story line, and spends as much time as it can on the perverted side of the students. They even put bouncing boobs on the fighting chibi characters, and a gross water fountain on the school grounds."
5,Best-Anime-Ever,"Hilarious and clever Baka & Test is my favorite Anime of the year! The Animation is great, the Japanese and English dub are superb and the quality is amazing!I can't wait for season 2!"
2,Does not fit 4gig,"Real nice looking case, but does not fit the 4gig nano. The bottom hangs a little out, and the screen and scroll wheel does not line up. Also, the hold button on top is not accessible. Was disappointed about the fit, but cannot complain for the price I got it for."
2,Praying Mantis - 'Best Of.....' (Frontiers),"Apparently, this thirteen track compilation is a bunch of third rate material that Praying Mantis had recorded in the '90's. Know now I need to check out their earlier work. Let me get this straight, THIS band is supposed to be of the 'New Wave Of British Heavy Metal' bunch? Not with this CD they're not. Problem here is they sound too much like Bon Jovi, and in some ways sort of maybe like a Thin Lizzy wanna-be. Obviously for the completists. Even THEN."
1,WORST OF....,This album is NOT the best of Praying mantis by far. The album only features material made in the 90's. What classic NWOBHM-band has their best songs made in the 90's? If you buy a compilation by a NWOBHM-band you expect 80's music. There is ONE 80's song though. It opens up the album and it is a livetrack. It is called 'Cheated'. That is the recordcompany's way of humiliate you for buying this album; by telling you straight out that you have been CHEATED.
1,Very slow in responding to order,"I ordered 2 of these pads seven days ago and just today my credit card was charged and the item shipped (hopefully). I don't know what this company's problem is, but the commumication is totally unacceptable. I am writing this review of the company that is selling this on Amazon. Have not seen the pads yet, so don't know about them. Anyway, if you don't mind this lag between ordering and them getting around to your order, go for it. Personally, there is too much competitiion nowadays for companies to hav this kind of attitude towards paying customers. I expected better from Amazon, too."
4,my friends keep swiping this book from me,"I keep buying this book and aside from the movie Boondock Saints, it keeps getting snatched by all my friends. I don't ever get to read it myself. My friends like it though. Grrrrrrrrrrrrr!"
2,The title says it all...,"It is my fault I chose to purchase this book, thinking it would be useful to me. ""Instant Analysis"" gives you what is says on the tin. A shallow analysis on how to deal with different issues , one faces in life. It sounds more like those teenager magazines with different ""tips"" on how to improve your life than a serious work that may help you with something. Unfortunately, I have to say it is not worthy."
1,WEAK AND SUPERFICIAL,"I own the book and have read it. its easy to read but i think very weak.Dl went on to write one or 2 best sellers where he advises folks to ' insert a false fact'...IE LIE !!!!!heres from a 2 star review for IA:A psuedo-Freudian romp that runs from amusing to mediocreI suppose if you're going to cast a wide net, you'll catch much junk!!!!"
1,Inane,"I liked Lieberman's book ""make peace with anyone"" but this one is terrible. 302 pages of inane advice. Chapter 24. ""why do I enjoy being angry?"" Lieberman suggests I ""find excitement in other ways"" Wow. How about, chapter 25, ""why do I do the stupidest things?"" well, I should ""learn from mistakes, cut your losses, and move on"", ok, right, no more books by David Lieberman bought online. I'm going to ""interpret situations positively when possible"" and use Search inside the book option to avoid making this mistake again"
2,A psuedo-Freudian romp that runs from amusing to mediocre,"I suppose if you're going to cast a wide net, you'll catch some fish but also a lot of seaweed, old boots and other assorted junk. Some of the analytic vignettes make sense, but they are so general I can hardly imagine they'd be at all useful to anyone. The advice also assumes a person has a good deal of hangups, insecurities and issues, so if you don't perhaps this book isn't for you. I'm not sure exactly why I read this book (although I borrowed it from the library, which I'm now happy I did instead of buying it), but quickly abandoned it out of boredom after an hour or so. Funny title and packaging, though."
2,too small,"In picture looks good. Too small, I ddint expect it to be like this.Anyway waste of money, do not want to return this and waste time."
4,Nice size for bag,This net is a little small for my daughters 20 gallon tank but it's the perfect size for fishing new purchases out of the plastic bag if you don't want to pollute your tank with pet store water.
5,"Complete, Easy to Use","This book is the most complete I have ever come across, and extremely easy to use. The illustrations (2500) and terms (26000) are well-described and easy to use, yet concise. As a Project Manager for a General Contractor, I find this book extremely handy in the construction world. Working with an Architect on a daily basis, I find myself using it several times per day sometimes. You can never learn every term in architecture and construction, but this book will help you learn those unfamiliar words we come across every single day in construction and architecture."
3,No difference,"The product was tolerable, but it didn't make any difference in my health. It did arrive swiftly from the sender."
4,No DVD?,"Will this ever be released on DVD? The DVD collection of Dave's videos is long overdue. Come on, release it already."
2,not worth the time and money,"surprised the book was thin and very short.quick read in less than 15 min.i liked the title however did not really get anything i didn't kinda already know.it did spark an intrest to pass it along to another, however not worth the time and money to buy and ship"
3,Inexpensive extra battery,"I have purchase several extra batteries for my Kodak Easy Share camera. Since the only warning that the battery is low is the icon that comes on when the battery is about to die, it is imperative to have a backup battery that is fully charged and can be put in immediately. This battery cost a fraction of an OEM battery. I would recommend it to a friend."
2,"Good military, but poor writing","The good part of this book is Ringo's feel for the military. It's quite clear, once you get past the dull and boring beginning, that he's been there, and knows what he's talking about. The bad part is that the writing itself lacks sparkle. Maybe as Ringo continues on-- this is his first novel-- he will improve, but for this first try the prose is servicable, but clumsy. Overall conclusion: if you like military sf, you'll like this one; if you're looking for literary, fergittaboutit."
1,The biggest battle was forcing myself to finish it.,"Simply awful and wins the award for the worst book I have ever read.The lead character is clearly the author's daydream for himself. Utterly unbelievable short guy with enormous muscles (inferiority complex perhaps?), computer geek and part time sci-fi author who just happens to be the best warrior in the universe and is married to the most beautiful girl in the world.The remaining characters (there are many) are forgettable and often not necessary. The chapters leap from one character to another and frustratingly do not follow chronologically.Clearly the author knows his military but most of the detail he goes into feels unnecessary. I got the impression we were playing ""who knows the most acronyms""A competent editor may have been able to cut enough of the rubbish from this novel and force enough re-writes to make it enjoyable but clearly no editor was employed.You need to be a really hardcore military sci-fi fan to get through this book."
1,Astonishingly Bad,"OK, the story idea is kind of good. Earth has been contacted by races, fighting a long war, who aren't constitutionally able to fight. So we're needed. Very good. From that rather nice premise we descend into a mess of detail unessential to the story, characters almost indistinguishable from one another, bad motivations and dopey people who get to develop dopey ideas at length. Well, I'm an SF addict and it took 200 pages before I'd had enough. Some ideas are lifted from Heinlein and others without much attempt to carry them further. On the bright side, it's only 4 clams, delivered."
1,Poor to very poor,"This book is badly written and at times just plain silly. Ringo also has the bad habit of indulging in little side stories that go on and on and on. It's really not worth your time. There are much better authors of military science fiction out there, such as Weber, White, Deitz and Drake."
4,I like this book,This was a well written book that began your Posleen adventure. The characters as well developed and become your friends.
4,"Good plot, burdensome descriptions","I like sci-fi, and much of it is military-scentric. That's o.k., I generally like that sort of action. This book has some very good premises, and some interesting plot lines. But it seems that the author is trying to impress everyone with how much he knows about military acronyms and the chain of command. It was very burdensome at points, and as I finished the book I realized that virtually all of it was unnecessary.Overall a good book. I just wish an editor would have toned down the military jargon just a bit."
4,Enjoyed this book,"Started reading SF again after a pretty long break. AHBB was surprisingly good, and launched me back into the genre again. Characters are better developed than most, and tech concepts are well described without giving that ""tech manual"" feel on other SF books I've read. Plus, if you did around, you'll find a free ebook of AHBB circulating around..."
5,FIRE ONE!!!,"John Ringo's first novel is a smash. Having grown up all over the world and served in the Airborne division, John has had a unique look at life and at combat, much like David Drake.This is a story of combat and intrigue. READ IT!! You won't be disappointed. Fast moving, well-detailed. John is now on my 'buy' list for military fiction. Kudos to Jim Baen for picking up this talented first time author."
2,[Sick],"Just because this guy is freinds with David Weber doesn't mean he can write Sci Fi. This book is tedious and I won't be reading any more of the series. It has all the usual plot devices about evil aliens and I'm sick of it, SICK I say! This is just like the Shiva Option, which I feel is equally weak.Ringo should write contemporary military fic and see how well he does there. My guess is, it would be a whole lot better."
2,Please make it better next time,"Is it a book or a computer game? The characters act like the robots they are inside their battle-suits; the alien Posleen get slaughtered en masse, preferably by dropping mega-skycrapers on them ... Oh yes, there are interesting parts as well - the ""allies"" play a very deep game, but one really has to stretch the imagination to see a plot here. In sum: stupid!For a first novel this may not be so bad, however in that case the blame for its lack of plot and other weaknesses is with the editor. But maybe it was a first for them too ... . Please make it better next time."
2,Heinlein Redux,"While diverting enough, A Hymn Before Battle is basically a recycled Starship Troopers in the very familiar BEM sub-genre of science fiction, aimed a bit more at adults but exceedingly derivative. The hero is an Irish Woody Allen on steroids, a peerless soldier/technogeek of exceeding ugliness married to a woman apparently a cross between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Demi Moore. Every trite military stereotype is here: clueless brass, gruff sergeants with hearts of gold, second loots from sniveling to super, a sniper babe, and terminal acronymania. The first half of the book is the traditional gathering of the fabled warriors sort of thing and setting up the overall conflict; it moves like a snail in January molasses. The second half is much better, and the climactic battle scenes are truly super. Not a writer to make you forget Turtledove, Drake, Flint, Stirling--or Heinlein or E.E. ""Doc"" Smith, for that matter."
3,It's like the Volvo of biking helmets,"Well... Volvo from the 80s and 90s, anyway. It's a bit boxy, and not terribly aerodynamic nor sexy, as other reviewers here have mentioned. Seems a bit heavy. However, I have no fear that when the day finally comes that I bounce it off the pavement with my noggin inside (as always happens in the end), it will ably protect me from serious injury.Also, one bill retention point was broken when mine arrived, which was kind of a pity, as I'd been considering using it. I now see that other reviewers have had similar experiences to THAT, as well.In the end, it's more than adequate for the money, but it won't be helping you pick up dates at the trailhead. ;)"
4,"Damn, this thing is ugly...","This helmet fits me well, is adjustable, durable and cheap for a quality helmet.The two major drawbacks in my eyes are that:1: It's ugly. Ugly to the point that you're probably going to be made fun of for wearing it.2: The vents are poorly designed and you're going to get warmer biking in this. In colder weather, this is actually a plus but when it's hot and you're on a long ride be prepared to sweat a little more than usual."
4,good value,went with this over the faction. lighter and in solid colors this one is not too outlandish like some of the other helmets.
3,Dissappointed,"well, gives basic concepts, a quick read will give you an understanding of the gui, etc,etc...but in the end, online tutorials is the best way to go..worth reading?...yesworth 18 dollars plus shipping?...NO."
2,"More of an instruction manual, than a how to book","This book tells you what the various features are, but spends almost no time showing you how to put hem to any real use. I was hoping for a book full of tutorials, instead I got a little orange owner's manual for the software. It tells you how to do a few small excercises here and there, but by and large this is more a collection of features, than it is a book of instructional tutorials."
2,"Dissapointing, not a good book on combustion.","This book describes what things do and leaves the reader to fend for themselves. There are examples tutorials, but the problem is they are brief and do not do much to help one understand combustion itself. The whole book reads as if the author is giving you tips on how to make your compositions, without actually explaining, or giving further ideas on how a beginner could proceed.Pros: Color pages make it nice to see whats going on. Author goes over interface a lot and defines terms well.Cons: Examples are short, and do not explain very much. Reader is left to figure out ambiguous ideas and concepts, making it harder than need be for the new user.Combustion 4 Fundamentals Courseware, is the best book about combustion. Isbn:0240807758Combustion:Grounds Rules,-better book but has some errors.Isbn:0766841456"
4,Great book but the graphics.................,"Great book, I imagine it would be hard to write any book on such a complex program. My only gripe is the screen shots. Combustion's normal interface is black background with grey text, which is legible on a monitor, but almost unreadable in a book. So, next edition, use a different color scheme please!"
5,A Creative Cover,I'm a big fan of Creative products. The MP3 players really stand out and do so much more than the IPODS. My Creative Zen carries the soundtack of my life. Some family photos and a big 20 gigs! I was worried though I had no case to product my precious music box. My zen was being disturbed. In the interest of safety(and peace of mind) I needed to put a cover on it. I went to the Creative Web page and they don't even acknowledge this product. Shame on them! But thanks to Amazon and SF Planet my search was over Nice padded leather case with room for some notes or memory cards. Delivery was prompt and the case is beautiful. The MP3 player snapped in tight and will not fall out. Just what I needed.Sanctuary: 20 Years of Windham HillI am gonna go put on some Windham Hill and zone (zen) out now.
4,A high Energy Band Who Has Potential,"If you're into Less Than Jake, Pietasters, Sublime, Suicide Machines and Buck o Nine, then you have another strong and powerful pop record on your hands. This record has some great production and I'm quite sure that any pop-punk fan of (especially) Less Than Jake will not be disappointed. The band seems to have some high energy and just needs to be giving the right outlets to the pop-punk community to put their name on the map"
4,A Mix Of Ska And Punk That Works,"Rx Bandits are another cool new band that people haven't been checking out because everyone hates ska now and it's all ""old"" and crap. But if you're still into it, you should give Rx Bandits a chance. They're fast, catchy, and cool. This is one of the best mixes of the two genres I've heard yet, mainly because everyone hates ska now...my point is, give this CD a chance. I got it used, after I listened to my brother's You'll Never Eat Fast Food Again CD, and I thought they were cool. I went to the store, got it, and thought it sucked for the first week. But if you listen more, you'll like it. Cool CD.The best songs are Wrong With Me and Cornered, but a lot more of them are rad too. It's good music to have when you're skating. Also check out the only other two bands who I think meld the two styles together well, Suicide Machines and Aquabats."
3,"Pretty good, but not their best...","This is a great album. It makes me want to jump up and down, thrashing my head around violently enough to give even my onlookers whiplash, but musically, this album is not their best.In ""Halfway..."" RxB has a youthfulness to them, a lot of high energy, which is great. I particularly like ""Now or Never"" because of it's plucky ska tune. So if you love ska/punky alternative reggae, this album is for you. If you need something a little more loud and hardcore, look to their other 2 albums..."
4,Trust In Those Who Build,"Best line in the book: ""Well, you have to be a Democrat to get elected in this state, so that's what I'll be. But I'll be the most independent Democrat anyone has ever seen!This is a good read set in a time of tremendous growth and change. Learn a lot about life in the first decades of the Twentieth Century. The book will keep your attention."
1,unsatisfied,"The quality is good, but the problem is that I received the product wrong. After I opened the bag I saw that instead of coming 3 small e 1 large pieces, it came 2 large and 2 small pieces."
5,Stovetop looks like new,"The first set came bent, but Amazon.com is fantastic. Free return shipping for the damaged items. The second set arrived in a day or two. They fit perfectly and look great."
3,More of a Pamphlet than a Book,"This is more of a pamphlet than a book. For someone interested in the man and to see a few of his works, it is OK, but don't expect too much ""eye candy""."
3,Disappointing,"I wish I had read Faust without knowing the story or having seen/read the numerous knockoffs that have appeared over the years. Having said that, it will influence my review. Unfortunately, I am too familiar with the story to have enjoyed it. The translation seemed too archaic for my liking. I found it hard to keep my attention and appreciate not only the story, but the style of the writing.I'm giving it three stars because a book doesn't last without it being influential and liked by many generations. If not for me, this book does that for many other people.Ultimately, I am disappointed that the book didn't hold my attention. I am a voracious reader and I love the classics. Perhaps it was the translation I was disappointed with. If you read this book, give it time and appreciate the nuances of the story."
1,False review,I've noticed same comment made (almost word by word) to the previous book of Gladstone (Venture Capital Handbook) meaning that they're not reviews at all but sheer PR or advertisement to sell books. I didn't buy both of them.
2,Sewing for Plus Size,"I did not find this book helpful. I feel that the fashion tips are ridiculous for plus size women. Checks, bright colors and huge caftan type clothing are certainly not flattering. I am a plus size and I would never wear any of the selections found in this book. They are loud, loose and make the model look like she even heavier than she is. I found Sandra Betzina's books, especially Power Sewing, to be much more detailed and helpful. The sewing techniques in this book are certainly not couture in my opinion. The techniques are quick, but the results are a home-made look and the fit is poor. The waistline techniques are amatuer at best. My skills are on the intermediate level and I did not gain any helpful information from this book. Having found better selections in the Sandra Betzina line of patterns and books, I gave this book away, because there is nothing I found in it that I consider worth my time."
4,Great book.,"Bought this because of a class on Craftsy I subscribed do that was by her. She explains very well how to adjust the bust area, etc and her instructions are easy for me to understand and follow."
4,Sewing for Plus Sizes book,"One of the better sewing books with instructions for fitting larger sizes, with explicit directions. This book gives excellent instructions and explanations, a real plus to my sewing library."
2,I wasn't impressed,I should have returned it. The author models her own creations and they are not attractive. It's not exactly what I wanted.
3,Sew-Sew,The information was helpful but not as detailed as I had hoped. It assumes the reader has a lot of sewing knowledge.
5,Great advice with a Positive Attitude,"Barbara Deckert cheerfully addresses all the issues that plus sized women face when considering their wardrobe. She does so with such enthusiasm as to instill confidence and optimism that even large people can dress with pleasure and pazazz. She discusses design features for various body shapes, how to take measurments, the influence of different types of fabric and pattern alterations to get the perfect fit for every body - including all those bits we don't like to talk about. After my first whizz through this book I am so excited about getting back into my sewing again now that I'm armed with such good advice. But I know I'll be referring to it again and again in the coming months and years. I'm so glad I bought this book."
1,Waste of money,"I thought this book would be an actual how to book and it really didn't help me one bit. Commercial sewing patterns don't fit right and I thought this would really be a way to sew something that fit, but it was complicated, didn't make alot of sense to me, and I've never used it."
1,disappointment,"I was disappointed in this book. Not that it isn't a good book, but I did not learn anything new. I was expecting the differences in plus size - average size but it is all the same.Lucie"
3,The Glass is Dry!,"Although I am greatful for having been introduced to the story, something false, almost comic hero/villain like rings to me. I can only point at the young first time writer Jeremy Mercer for this effect. He sensationalizes their life and crimes well. I would be interested to know the real story as to how things went down. Mr.Mercer fails to give us some truth about these young men. He waits 150+ pages in to tell us of the broken home Yves Belanger came from ( a lame portrait painted at that). I think this here is a case of a young writer who grew up a good boy, and is reveling in the mysterious, exciting criminal world of the boys from the other side of the tracks, the whole time wishing it could be him."
2,Put it to rest,"I just read the ""reviews"" of this ""book"" and felt compelled to write. I happen to have first hand knowledge of what's true and what's not. I would just like to clarify a few things. First of all the book is greatly exaggerated and glamorized.(The only reason it got two stars,hats off Jeremy try some fiction). Secondly,despite what the previous reviewer ""gang member"" says I believe the sentence was fair and there is remorse.Finally,if this misguided interpretation of the facts can be published as true,why does'nt someone create a sequel."
1,More Still.....wrong album previews oops!,I think you have the wrong album posted in the sound samples. These samples are christmas songs. the album is about the Carribeann
4,Excellent workout routines for anyone in the martial arts.,"Even though this book first came out in 1974; nevertheless, the information it contains is timeless. I have personally used many of the routines and found them excellent programs that helped me become better at karate and jujitsu. The sections include tips for using this book, which gives general training tips. The next section is a glossary of weight lifting exercises. Weight training routines are in the next section, followed by various hand exercises. Section five is my favorite because it shows various practical applications of karate and kung-fu. Section six shows various stretching exercises and a few body weight exercises. In conclusion, this book is for anyone who desires to learn how to combine weight training exercises along with your martial arts training.Rating: 4 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Samurai Aerobics: The Kenjutsu/Kendo Workout Program)"
3,an emerging person through her poetry!,"These poems, written by accomplished TV and movie actress, Amber Tamblyn, are the real thing: the journey, the exploration, growing pains and determination.Best known for her role in TV's Joan of Arcadia, Amber's poetry was first published at age 16. She has also appeared in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and General Hospital.Some of her poems address her obsession with the feminine image in today's over-sexually-glorified world of ads and entertainment. Others are about world events, racism, justice and other rights--and about the lack of people understanding both sides of an issue.Armchair Interviews says: For a young woman, Amber sees things clearly, and helps us see them also with her powerful poetry."
3,Brava!,"Here is a poet with the courage to take the staples off the wound on your chest, and heal it with droning verbiage. If this ends up in the hands of your boyfriend, he may just have to travel cross-country to get in her magical pants."
2,Disappointing reading of wonderful poetry.,"This recording cannot compare with Musical Heritage Society's Treasury of 19th Century English Poets (MHC 312505Z). The readings (with some exceptions - ""Jabberwocky"" is delightful and ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" is well done - are dull and unengaging. The music is intrusive and unevenly recorded. Not at all the quality I would have expected from BBC, which has released really wonderful renditions of Shakespeare."
1,Take Off Your Clothes,"Take Off Your ClothesNot quite what i had been hoping for, I will have to do a more advanced search.I had heard the record, nearly 40 years ago in Malawi, by Bob Baulf and His Knights."
1,Not worth the money,"This DVD was not useful for a true beginner. The production quality was poor. It looked home made and it was sometimes difficult to hear the speaker who sometimes mumbled. Other than learning how to hold the drum, it left me knowing that perhaps the only way to get any real instruction is in person with a teacher. Definitely not worth the price. For ten dollars maybe, for over thirty dollars, forget it."
2,Strange mix,"Professor Rubin's text, explicating baseball's pre-game rituals, is satisfactory, but the acccompanying photos which are strangely, in black and white, seem unncessarily arty and dated."
3,Not what you think.,This is not Japanese music. This is not a soundtrack to the game. This is just some rock band.
4,"No reviews, wtf?","Luna ad Noctum should be listened to by all metalers. They definately have what it takes to be a great band. They have very sick lyrics ala Cradle of Filth. These guys are not sell-outs, though. It is hard to describe, but they touch on almost all areas of metal. You will either love them or hate them. Listen, it's your call. IMO one of the best finds I have came across. No clean vocals!!!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,This is one of the most poorly researched and poorly written Civil War books I have ever read! The author didn't even pretend to do any original research. His topic deserves much better coverage than he has given it.
1,Extremely Poor,"Seldom have I been as disappointed as I was when I read this book. The subject has long needed an able historian to deal with it, and that day still has not arrived. Raphael appears to have done next to no original research even though there are hundreds of manuscripts around the country, not to mention in his home of Louisiana, that would have helped. The writing style is also poor. I'm still waiting for a ""definitive"" study."
3,"Nice, but small.","I got my watch as a gift and I loved the look of it. The problem I have is that the watch band will only work for men with small wrists. I'm sorry Amazon, but ""mens"" is not a lenth! The total length of this watch and band is 9 inches and then the first hole in the band is set back a bit. I need at least 9-1/2 inches in total length to wear a watch comfortably. I consider myself an ""average"" guy at 6 feet tall and 190 lbs. I am amazed how difficult it is to find out the length of the watch band on most sites."
5,Vlad The Impresser,"I am so grateful that historic works such as this are available for the music lover. When Horowitz returned to Moscow after so many decades, and played such a fantastic concert-this is a keeper."
5,A Giant at the Steinway,"Horowitz In Moscow is a must see & hear DVD of Horowitz's return to Moscow at the age of 82 in 1986. This is after 61 years of self-imposed exile. He plays Mozart, Scriabin, et al on his truck-a-long Steinway grand piano.He is marvelous. As the photographer pans the audience during Schuman's Traumerei, a gentleman of indistinct years is shown in a stoic pose, with the exception of a tear falling off his cheek. Very moving.Horowitz at 82 played as if he were a young man. I am not easily impressed, but I bought an extra copy to give to a friend."
1,Flimsy,"There is little to recommend this novel for people with any background knowledge on the Wars of Roses, or really to anyone who enjoys good writing. The writing is sappy, clumsy, and not accomplished. This makes for painful reading, and to be honest I had to stop about 75% way into it. As for the history...There is a wealth of information on Margaret of Anjou if you take the time to find it, and the facts that were portrayed could have been lifted off Wikipedia. As for a serious understanding of what her life entailed or how Margaret, as both a person and character evolved over the course of her life, there was nothing but oversentmentalized rhetoric.Not recommended. Try Sharon Kay Penman."
4,HITTING ALL THE RIGHT KEYS,"PARADISE constitutes 4 stories revolving Elvis, the king of Rock and the romances that soared with him around as the matchmaker. The first story by Madeline Baker may proved too far-fetch and mythical - with Jessie, a manifestation of Elvis in the form of a vampire, learning love can last longer than eternity and youth. The second by Nina Bangs hit all the right keys, with a calculative business lady falling in love with a theme park operator Dylan. The others by Kathleen Nance and Ann Lawrence were buoyant, focusing more on inner feelings between two lonely characters jumping at a chance in love.The stories are fleeting, transient like heavensteps to PARADISE - they are typical romances spiced up by wicked chemistry and rousing narrative. Not memorable nor poignant, but simply a good read taking you to heavenly dreams."
5,A Higher America,"Having authored the first ""authorized"" biography of an anthemic rock group (I Want to Take You Higher: The Life and Times of Sly & the Family Stone, available through amazom), I've been psyched about how music can rouse a nation. Sousa's creations have been fueling that spirit for over a century now, and it's great to be able to hear on one recording what we've heard marching through our streets and across football fields and movie and tv screens all these years, along with a few less familiar tunes. Very good for your state of mind, in a time when hope for the state of the nation is also high.I Want to Take You Higher: The Life and Times of Sly and the Family Stone"
5,A flag waving fourth of July,We purchased this music to use as part of a Fourth of July celebration. It was just exactly what we needed to set the tone for the party.
3,Mediocre,"This album is a great disappointment. Tempo is slow and execution is not crisp as it should be. There are better versions of Stars and Stripes Forever, and Semper Fidelis that make me want to pick up my feet and march. This album puts me to sleep!Instruments seem to be competing for the spotlight rather than working for a cohesive sound. Sounds like a high school. . . make that a junior high school band. I wish I could get my money back. The only positive feature is that there are 18 tracks so I could learn the names of songs I'd heard long ago."
3,Standard Sousa,"The great hits of Sousa here. Nothing new, nothing different. The same pop hits of Sousa that nearly every CD on him puts out. A lot of these selctions are repeats from Altissimos other Sousa CDs. Recording quality is un-even because tracks are from all different times. Marine band is good, but we don't know who is directing them or when they were recorded."
5,Excellent Series,I find it difficult to change the CD when driving around in my truck. There is something magical about Sousa's marches that never grows old.
3,not disapointed,it works. seems a little cheap and the finger ring broke ...and had to file down the cocking pin itself before it fit in my gun but now that ive got it in it works fine
3,AFL gets short shrift,"This is from NFL Films and it seems like they still hold a grudge from the wars pre-merger with the AFL. When I think of pro football in the '60s, I do think of the Green Bay Packers but I also think of the wide open air attacks and crazy characters in the AFL. The video touches on that era but ""touches"" is the key word. We get barely a few minutes yet the video has time to talk about marginal figures of the era like the Rams' Bucky Pope and the 49ers' Clifton McNeil.It's not a bad video at all but I just felt the focus was too much on the NFL and not enough on the AFL."
5,Know this about Melissa and Doug customer service...,"This is a great toy! Very educational. Every door has a doorbell with a different ring, a different person with different colors to correspond to the color of the door, and it is just plain creative! As a mom of 4 children, all born within 5.5 years of one another :), I will let you know that if you EVER, EVER have a problem with a Melissa and Doug product, their customer service is BAR NONE! Call them directly with your concern, no matter how minor you think it is, and they will go to great lengths to appease you. We've had cracked wood on a cupcake replaced with a new one, screws on their art easel's replaced (due to our neglect, not theirs), an entire wooden walker replaced b/c just one alligator didn't chomp, etc. I cannot say enough good things about M&D toys."
3,My 25 month old twin boys love it but quality sucks,My boys got this for Christmas and they both love it and have spent hours playing with it. I love that the keys are attached and my boys love the little dolls which seem to be made well! my boys love the door bells!It is poorly made though and I can tell it likely won't hold up for very long with two two year old boys playing with it. The keys are hard to put in the key holes and can cause some frustration for both boys and even a little dificult for mom and dad as they need to be inserted just right. It would be nice if the keys were color coated in addition to the numbers to aid in the children being able to identify the correct key for each door.just for the enjoyment the boys have had over the past few days I would give it 5 star rating but for quality I would give it a 2 star. When this one brakes I will not purchase again as I don't like disposable toys.
2,Frustrated kid,Nothing like frustrating your kid with a toy. The keys do not work and the doorbells are very particular. They have to pushed several times before you hit it just right. Boo
3,Educational and fun toy but flawed,"Our daughter got this toy for her 2nd birthday and loved the doorbells. She enjoys playing with the keys but doesn't quite get the different key concept yet. The toy is very educational and keeps her entertained. The problem with the toy is that the first time a key was inserted in door number 4 the lock pushed straight into the house. The locks are just cheap plastic locks that break easily. Also, some of our doors were warped when we got it as well. The lanyard for the keys is a good idea it's just not long enough. Overall, it's not a bad toy it just has a few flaws."
2,The Poor House,"This house is expensive enough that I thought it would live up to the quality of other Melissa and Doug products. However, one of the plastic locks was not completely formed so it was impossible to get the key in there. The paper on the walls and doors seemed to be a little bent around the edges, and the roof didn't look like it was on quite right."
1,BE WARNED!!,"This product came in wrapped in plastic, but it looked very used. Upon removing the plastic we found that the keys were rusted!!! The latches on the doors are CAKED with rust. These rusty parts smell bad and leave your hands smelling like old metal. This is a JOKE! My daughter was so disappointed that we had to throw this unsafe mess or a toy away.*I tried to post a pic of the rust, but I don't guess that's an option*"
2,Good concept; BAD implementation,"I bought this for my niece, despite some of the bad reviews. Having purchased products made by this company before, I gambled that they would deliver the quality they had in the past. Was I wrong! My niece played with this for about a minute before one of the plastic locks came off in her hand. She was not playing rough or misusing the toy in the least. The plastic tab that holds the lock in the door broke off, and then the lock kept falling out. They may look like brass in the picture, but the locks are actually plastic (and very feeble at that). I was so disappointed and embarrassed- everyone at first commented on what a neat toy it was. Nobody was impressed (least of all me) when my niece's smile crumpled into a look of worry when her new toy got broken.I love a lot of Melissa and Doug toys, but I urge you to PASS on this one."
4,"Cute, neat toy","This is a very neat toy. Each doorbell is different, and each door has a unique key. The house is very durable, and the little people are cute. I bought it for my daughter at 16 months, and she really enjoys it."
4,granddaughter's favorite birthday gift,"I gave this to my 3 year old granddaughter for her birthday and it was her favorite gift. She is fascinated with locks and keys so it was perfect. The design is sturdy and attractive and I love that she can carry it with her, which she did. She is learning to match the number on the key to the door number to help open them and has to manipulate each key just right. The only negative is that the keys are not very heavy metal so we need to remind her not to try to force them as they could get bent or break off. Also, keys are attached to the handle with a web strap so they won't get lost...nice touch!"
4,Hours of Fun,"Looks smaller than it sounds but very, very cute. Our granddaughters (3 and 5 years old) both love it. The house has 4 compartments inside, so each door accesses a separate compartment and our girls never seem to get tired of ringing the doorbells, opening and closing doors... They put the 4 little kids (that come with the house) inside and then take them out, again and again.Each door has its own key and the keys are tethered to the house. So far great, but the tie is so short and wide that it makes it really difficult to use the little keys. On the plus side, the doorbells ring so softly that they do not disturb anyone. Cute toy!"
4,the keys could be a little easier to use,The keys get stuck sometimes and the numbers are SO hard to see on the keys--this could be a great toy with a few tweaks.
2,Poor Quality Keys and Locks,I bought this toy for a Christmas gift for my grandchildren because I think Melissa and Doug toys are usually very well made and interesting. The kids enjoy playing with it but the keys were bent in the first 15 minutes of play and can no longer be used. They still play with the doorbells but I was disappointed in how poor the quality of the keys and locks were. I would Not recommend this toy.
2,Disappointed!,"My 20 months nephew loves playing with doors and I thought it would be a fun gift for him. I received the first order and one of the doors just won't open. I got a replacement unit, then one of the doorbell doesn't function properly - sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn't. There are also minor scratches on the wooden door and the locks. I have to say though it's a very sophisticated design and it's a lovely unit. My nephew loves putting the baby doll in and out of the house and enjoys listening to the door bell. But I think because of the complexity of the design the product is not as sturdy and door locks don't function smoothly. Melissa and Doug have some great creative toys but this one is disappointing."
1,This toy should not be sold!,The quality of this toy is very poor. I had to order 7 dollhouses just to find 2 that were not gouged or broken. I don't expect this toy to last very long. Two of them came gouged. Two of them had one doorbell that didn't work. One came with a lock pushed in even before it was opened. I can't believe that Melissa & Doug would ever make something of such poor quality. No wonder you can't find it on their website anymore. Very disappointed. Something that looked so cute & adorable turned out to be a nightmare finding 2 that were in good condition. I'm afraid to ask my niece if it's still in working condition. Bet it's not.
3,Locks are cheap plastic.,"This is a great toy in theory, but like others have said, the locks are cheap plastic. I wouldn't mind so much, except because they feel flimsy, stick and won't take much force, it's harder to use the lock/key feature -- which makes it much harder for younger children to use."
1,"Big brand fan, but this thing is poorly made","I purchased this Doorbell House at a local toy store, then read the reviews here about it falling apart. Sure enough, Christmas morning my 3 year old asked for help with door #4, and as soon as I touched the lock with the key the entire lock fell out. The locks seem to be plastic. The door #4 was also attached crooked so it doesn't really close right anyway. The doors are really tricky to unlock. So sad, this is a great idea. I've never had a problem with Melissa and Doug toys and we have so many of their items. This toy must have been done by a new manufacturer."
3,Great idea,"This wooden doorbell house is a great idea, but the keys are too small making it hard (impossible) for my 3 year old son to use. My 18 month old daughter loves to stuff the people in their rooms. For now, I'm going to use this along side the medieval castle by M&D as a jail or outhouse, whatever. I'm concerned about how long this will look good. It is paper glued to wood. When I received it, one of the bottom corners of the house was roughed up. I'm thinking about reinforcing it somehow, glue, tape, not sure yet. I thought about returning it, but I decided to keep it...still not sure if I should have. Oh well."
3,Awesome idea - poor construction,I ordered this for my daughter who loves keys and locks and doorbells. She's only 22 months but she has great fine motor skills so I thought this would grow with her.Here are the cons:This toy does not come with batteries so you should think about having two AAAs ready when you get it (and a screwdriver).Sometimes you have to press the doorbells a few times for it to chime - not sure if ours is just defective.The key strap is a great idea but it would've been perfect had it been just a few inches longer and a little thinner - the length and width of it now requires you to hold the keys a certain way and it almost feels awkward.The locks are so loose and flimsy that they automatically just fall down (therefore locking the doors) even though the key is in the keyhole turned to the unlocked position.All that said my daughter plays more with the dolls (hiding them behind the doors) than with the locks.
5,Make Believe Fun,I gave this to a 5 year old for her birthday and she loves it. The working locks and brass keys are great! She really enjoys the little dolls that came with the house too. Her parents say it's worked out great for car trips or play dates since it's easy to carry.
2,bit too simple,"I think her writing style is interestingly spare and understated, but that the novel overall suffers from being too obvious and pat...vaguely interesting in some ways, but not necessarily a good book."
4,Still Great Fun - 1960's Brassy & Wall of Sound Pop,"If you love female vocalists and pop rock tracks from the 1960's and early 1970's - you just have to own this series. While not every track is a forgotten gem, there are ZERO uninteresting tracks. Every track features heartfelt performances and great musicianship.While there is a tendenacy for most of the tracks to all come out of cribbing the Brill/Wall of Sound sound - not that there's anything really wrong with that. While not as great as Volume 1, there are some classic trcaks on this collection and like every other disc in this series - everything is still fun, sexy and all girly girl.This entire set deserves a beautiful box & book to go with it all and it's something everyone who loves pop & female singers absolutely have to own."
1,this is not a good album,"As great as Gallant's earlier Blues For Allah Project is, that's how horrible this album is. I am a deadhead and a long time jazz fan. So my objection is not that these tracks don't sound like the originals. My objection is that they are too self consciously arty and over produced. They are almost entirely unlistenable. The execptions are the tracks, like Estimated Prophet, on which Gallant does what he is great at, wonderful big band charts that let the beauty and verasatility of the music become a playground for an excellent group of players swing.Too much strings, too much sampling, why is Bill Walton singing (rapping), regardless of how big a deadhead he is?Illuminati is a great live band. skip this cd."
3,I would have enjoyed this book more ...,"... if I hadn't read the Renunciates trilogy.While trying to avoid several spoilers to said trilogy, there is a completely unresolvable conflict between Rediscovery and the trilogy. Minor distortions of time and space, little contradictions, don't bother me so much -- but this one can't be resolved in any way that makes any sense.(Not to mention, given Lorill Hastur's supposed experiences in this book, as well as his twin Leonie's, their subsequent denial in both The Shattered Chain and The Forbidden Tower that ANY Terran could have laran ability just flat-out makes no sense. *sigh*)Read it, and try to enjoy it, because seeing the great Keeper Leonie of Arllinn as a mischevious teenager is fun. But try to keep it separate in your mind from the rest of the Darkover series."
5,"I Loved it, even while I cried","I truly enjoyed this book. Being the first of Marion Zimmer Bradley's that I read, it is the one that hooked me on Darkover. I would say that, not only do we get a glimpse into a differnt family (the Aldarans) and meet Margaret's mother, but we get to learn in detail about one of the most signifigant events in Darkoverian history. The characters are well portrayed, and your heart alternately breaks and leaps with joy as the characters cross hurdles. My favorite character was Ysaye. This book makes a powerful statement about abortion and the differnce between love and lust. I would recommend it to anyone..."
3,It is not the best of Darkover,"I found this book a repetition of situations seem in other darkover books, but not as well written. I waited years to read this book (because it was not available printed in my country) and was disapointed."
4,Rediscovery,"Good Series, I have a lot of her books. You can pick any of them up and start any where in the anthology."
3,A good book but ...,I thought this was a good book and the characters were well portrayed but I liked the second part better.The ship with all of it's people have crashed and soon they are rediscovering Darkover and making their own connections. Several of the Terrans have a little laran in them while the others seem to have none. What does that mean? Also things are happening between the Terrans and the Darkovans that they don't especially want ...I think anyone would enjoy this book and if you get stuck just keep on going because it definitley has it's good parts.
2,"This is a stupid, stupid book.","I've enjoyed the Darkover novels for years. They do fluctuate in quality, but this one is by far the worst of the lot and is not worthy of being considered part of the series. I suspect the co-author Lackey can be blamed for the ridiculous ""science fiction"" parts of the story, involving Terrans on a ship which crashes on Darkover. Absurdities here include a spaceship full of opera fans, etc. etc. However, I believe Bradley wrote the on-Darkover segments, which are little better. Leonie Hastur has suddenly become the obnoxious girl from the Pepsi commercials. Nothing is added to our understanding of Darkover here, which is a pity, since for me the world-building has always been the best part of the series. Also, both co-authors use a particularly pedestrian writing style. And getting Leonie trapped in a computer? Give me a break! Unless you're a diehard completist, skip this one."
3,Not Bad,"I bought this sword about a year ago and it has served all my purposes for, costume mostly. The handle is screw on but it still feels very solid, and if you're looking for a functional sword make sure its FULL TANG at very least. However considering the price you cant beat it, but I wouldnt recomend hitting too hard with it, light contact is fine but BE CAREFUL. So all in all, great costume sword excellent value, great for display."
4,Decent flag for the price,"This flag has been hanging in my living room for awhile. I saw one like it at a local ""hippie"" store for $15 and almost bought it. After finding out they sold it, I headed to amazon and found this one exactly like it. I bought it right away because it was so cheap. I received the flag and unfolded it. The only complaint I have is there is a spot on the flag that has a few black spots on it. No worries for the price I paid though. Thanks for the awesome flag."
5,VERY NICE,BOUGHT FOR A FELLOW EMPLOYEE. SHE LOVED IT. IT LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER IN PERSON. ITS A PRETTY BIG FLAG. WOULD RECOMMEND.
5,Classic Video,My son loves it. Ton of NBA dunk contest history. We love watching this together and will be enjoying for years to come.
3,It's Entertainment,If you love basketball you will like this DVD. It brings back memories and tells you the things you may not have known about some of the NBA greats.
4,SLAM DUNK,You get what you pay for. If you are buying this then you like the NBA slam dunk compatision and you get the greatest dunks from that in this DVD.I like it
4,An Interesting View of the Cold War,"Mr. Petterson has presented us with a very interesting and personal view of the Cold War from one of its more obscure and exotic locales. This book presents an interesting account of politics in 1960s East Africa through the eyes of the only US official to remain on the island of Zanzibar throughout the revolution. It describes the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar and dispels some of the myths surrounding the revolution. The author also provides interesting insight on the early careers of some of the notable figures to emerge in US and African politics including Frank Carlucci, Thomas Pickering, and Julius Nyerere. Anyone who is interested in East African politics or the East-West face off during the cold war should read this book. It is a great addition to any political science library."
3,Battle of the Bands: Round I...,"Just a word to the wise - as the format on the cover suggests, many of the songs are 45's (single) versions of the songs. Main Point: You and I is only 2:43 (instead of the 7:27 ORIGINAL, not the 5:58 1984 version that you find on the Collectables discs for Black Ivory). So, beware!My rating: 3 stars for the collection (singles? Bah?) Five stars for the groups! Overal rating: 3 stars!"
4,Fantastic Modern Horror,"I loved this book.I found it to be scary and gripping.I did not want to put it down. I also liked that it was set in modern times {The book came out in 1983, so I'll just assume its set in the 80s.}To me the book had a very distinct 80's feel to it which I enjoyed.I also thought the ending was terrific. I admit that it was pretty predictible, but I don't think that took any away from unforgettable effect.The mystery around Jade and the revelation of the real story behind him made for some heart pounding reading.This is the first book of Lisa Tuttles that I've read, but after this I want to read more."
3,Didnt help or ease my anxiety:(,"I thought I would try this for my anxiety issues. Ive tried it for about two weeks now and I havent felt like it has calmed me down at all. Which is kinda disappointing because I remember taking this once and it having that effect but I am not experiencing anything like that with this. Havent had a change in my diet or anything so....I'm just assume its just not the right treatment for me. But even though I didnt get the expected results I thought I would, i do notice that it makes me more alert in a way. So does something just not what I would particularly like.Probably wont repurchase for my anxiety, might use to help me study or to aid alertness."
2,Okay,2 star only because of the bitter taste of the herb. Did not really enjoy taste even cooking with it. Recommend to customers who like bitter taste
4,Good.,"Sometimes I feel with low energy in my day, but this product help me, sometimes I don't feel high but almost the time help me."
3,"Why Are There 4 Duplicate Reviews, Same Person???","Not sure if the 4 identical reviews by the same person for this product is by design or a mistake. If by design then this reviewer is attempting to skew the reviews for this product and I must suspect that she, in fact, does have an affiliation with this product and in some way hopes to profit?This should be investigated by Amazon"
1,GOTU KOLA - allergic reaction,I got an allergic reaction in a form of pimples all over my back and I stopped taking the pills. I beleave the dosage were too much for me. I checked a site and it recommends BY MOUTH:For blood circulation problems in the legs (venous insufficiency): 60-180 mg daily of gotu kola extract.well good luck people with this food for the brain.
4,Makita lithium charger,"Charger works well, charges rapidly BUT don't drop it... it is VERY delicate and will cease to function if droped and is expensive to replace. Only works with Makita lithium ion batteries."
1,NEVER buy this watch,"It claims as waterproof, but the water goes inside the watch. I can not read the time anymore. The seller is not willing to reslove this problem by no respons to the customer. It just wastes money."
3,Fossil watch,"This is a very pretty and dainty watch,. The fact that one can remove links is nice since I have small wrists. I needed a dressy watch and this fills the bill exceptionally well. The face is small and I need my glasses to see the time."
5,Dressy Ladies Fossil Watch - Style No. ES1510,"A gorgeous and delicate watch meant for a small wrist. It shines best in dim light, which makes it look very expensive."
4,Beautiful,"Fast shipping and the watch was nicer than I thought, it is very delicate and elegant. Also, it came with a nice little surprise...it came in a cute green box"
4,Guessing all the way . . .,"""Split Image"" is an apt title for a novel that sustains the hero-or-villain question throughout. As an investigative newswoman, one who's suffered more than her share of betrayal and violence, Ariel Gold seems a little quick to jump on the first emotional bandwagon that rolls by, even at the expense of one of her few stable relationships. Still it makes for a suspenseful story. Mercer is very good at sharp dialogue that propels the page-turning at a pace mystery lovers are bound to appreciate."
5,"Natures Way GTF Chromium, 200mcg 100 Capsules",I saw it talked about on Dr Oz so I thought I would get it a try. But so far it has not worked for me.
3,Not sure it is doing what it is supposed to do,I have not seen any difference. I have been taking it for a few weeks now and I'm not sure it is doing what it is supposed to do.
3,93 caps to go,"Well, no 6pak abs yet, can't get into my superman suit,and doubt if I'll ever fly or leap tall buildings in asingle bound but I've got a start on controlling my pre-diabetes.These supplements porbably won't show any changes until I'mdone with the bottle but it's a start. Price was right."
4,The Odds,"Tyler Johnston's character deals with the suicide of his friend Barry (Calum Worthy) in the first act, but refuses to believe it, and instead comes to the conclusion he must have won big from the wrong people. Luckily, the chemistry with these characters carries you through the rest of the movie superbly, as it casts notable actors with up-and-coming talent. The great thing about it is once you get attached to a character, or think you have them figured out; you turn out to be completely wrong, which is something I love in a film. Definitely worth taking a chance on."
5,Great,"Small, lightweight and has pretty much every word in the Portuguese language I bet. I use this in my classes regularly."
2,Not at all what I expected,"""Incomplete"" is the best word to describe this dictionary. I'm Brazilian, and for a native speaker this dictionary is far from ""avanado"" (meaning ""advanced"") as its Portuguese title suggests; incidentally in direct opposition to its English title: ""Concise Dictionary."" I bought it as an aid for a small translation project, and I am disappointed. It doesn't have words such as ""mentoring"" and ""stewardship."" I've had to revert to online searches, as I had started, in order to find an adequate translation for several words - a much more cumbersome method. If you need a truly advanced English/Portuguese Portuguese/English dictionary, keep looking; this is not it."
1,Very introductory. Not worth buying,"This 36 page book is very introductory in nature! If you want to know about Exchange Message Record (EMR) or Automatic Message Accounting (AMA) formats, it wraps it up in giving 4 lines of introduction for each. Not at all useful for professionals. Beginners should be able to find much more information on the net itself.. free of cost!"
3,Good High-Level Overview for Beginners,"This is a good, but not terribly polished, high-level overview of telecom billing processes. If you've spent any time at all with telecom billing systems you'll be familiar with 95% of the information in this document, if not more.The material is appropriate for anyone who's getting involved with telecom billing for the first time or who has been working on the periphery of the billing systems and would like to know more.Don't expect a lot of detail - there can't be a lot in a document that contains only 31 pages of content written using large type and a lot of white space.For example, the entire section on Hardware and Software consists of the following paragraph:""The hardware usually includes high performance computers that operate proprietary software. Due to the complexity of hardware and software billing systems, continuous training is required in order to ensure quality services to the customers and to provide revenue assurance."""
4,Good Introduction,This is a very good starting guide for somebody not used to billing processeses. Moreover there is not so much books dealing with this discipline. I am lookinf forward the full version if there gonna any...
5,perfect,I have this same thing in mahogany and wanted a different color for my other kitty. I absolutely love it. VERY easy to work with and my cats ashes fit purrfectly! :) Item arrived before ETA and was in purrfect condition.
4,Attractive and Functional,"I liked this product. I needed something very basic, yet elegant for my pet's remains and for a photo of him. This was much less costly than a lot of the urns I looked at. Many places that offer cremation also sell urns, but I am glad I purchased this rather than choosing only from what the pet cemetery had. It's not really a honey maple color. The photo is accurate; it's a darker color."
3,Very imaginitive,"It was a pleasant read but aimed at young people I suppose; however, much of it was made up. Nanny indeed!"
5,Best Rock Show,"This is a Rock and Roll show in all its glory, It just have new Chikenfoot song but all of them are wonderful and fit perfectly on the set and is a long Show, very extended versions. I bought it without knowing the songs and it doesn't matter, is wonderful.A most Have for rock fans from the 70s 80s 90s and 00sSammy, Joe, Michael and Chad, what else can you ask"
5,Blu Ray dvd {live} Chickenfoot,"Great Blu Ray dvd, Sound is Fantastic 1080P video is Fantastic musicians together are great Joe,SammyMichael & Chad, IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS."
4,Rockin 4 sure,"This show is as good as it gets for rockers, tight and upright. Get this and U won't be sorry. I've watched it at least 4 times since I bought it.."
5,Great Live Concert,"I caught an edited (shortened) version of this DVD on the Palladia channel on cable the other night and after watching it I really wished I had caught these guys live on the tour. The songs are tight yet a lot of fun. I am not a huge fan of Chad (hate the Chili Peppers, at least the last 10-12 years of them), but I may be converted. Sammy - what can you say - legend. Joe - amazing to watch him play. Michael is just pure fun too.I think this DVD really shows what amazing musician's these guys are, not only as a band but as individuals. Joe just shreds and it is fun to watch him in these environment vs. his solo stuff.Highly recommend. I am thinking of picking up the DVD as the cable version cuts out about half the songs."
4,Almost 5!,Almost 5 stars because...Satriani's instrumental virtuosism is always in 1st place! The band seems more like a support one for Joe`s solos. It`s great? of course!!! But the other 3 musicians deserved more space.
3,"Good voice, good vibe, good band....","After the debacle that was ""The Van Halen reunion tour.""This is such a step forward unlike firing your only back up singer/bass player and replacing him with your 16 year old for the tour.This band is firing on all cylinders and not that I've ever been a big Michael Anthony fan, but he does a really good job.Better drummer, and better vocals make this a really good band. Better vibe, and better singing make this big fun.Chickenfoot is a good band of seasoned professionals playing what they are comfortable with: good music.Sammy is a great front man, and at 62 hasn't lost anything weight notwithstanding.Let's here it for those who no longer tuck their shirts in...Rock On!"
3,"Music is great, video... so, so...","Chickenfoot is great; Sammy is great; so are the rest of the guys in the band. The music on this DVD is great, but... the video is so pixelated it's like I'm watching YouTube. C'mon, this is crap. If I was watching this video streaming over the internet I'd be ecstatic, but to have purchased a DVD with video of this poor quality I'm sorely disappointed."
3,"Enh for what it is, go back solo though joe!","Good tunes, i prefer Joe on his own, please don't stay in a band. He also seems so out of place, and just in the zone by himself. Joe is not a party dude or a goof like them he's a very serious dude lol. Oh well they are decent, sammy and Chad get on my nerves, though sammy has one hell of a voice still for a 60 year old man."
3,Could have been better,"With all the big names, Joe, Chat and Sammy, i was expecting more. Everybody was great individually, but as a band, I think the chemistry is yet to develop. Second or third album will be much more fun, I think."
4,anything by Parker is good.,"I own 5 cd's by William Parker as a leader, and each is unique. Parker rarely repeats himself, and his sound and compositions are always captivating. Here he teams with veteran clarinettist Perry Robinson. Robinson's style defies any stylistic definition - I find his playing to resemble Pee Wee Russell more than anything. I am not always crazy about his sound - although it is very personal and original. His playing made me give this CD 4 instead of the regular 5 stars usually reserved for William Parker - a true leader in modern music. If you already have Oniel's Porch, Painter's Spring, and Fractured Dimensions - t is time for Bob's Pink cadillac."
5,Tidy,A must have for any fan of Tidy. Has the best remixes and all the early classics. 2 unmixed CD's and one mixed from the DJ at Club Trade in the UK.
5,Beautiful,"I ordered this product after the loss of my cat from Fibrosarcoma. I searched for an urn for her, and the prices were outrageous. This one was perfect. It did however take me a few minutes to figure out how to open it up for the pictures. This may help others figure out how to open it. On the smaller part, there's a part on the top you need to slide out to put the picture in. For the bigger part, you need to unscrew the four small screws, and remove the back followed by the inner lighter board to put the picture in."
3,Great flag except...,I've actually had this flag a few years but never wrote a review for it. I need to replace it at some point. The colors are a little off. The arrows and VI should be Caribbean blue and not navy blue.
1,Help,I can`t give a review because the cd won`t work. I`ve been trying to return itbut haven`t found a way to return it.
5,Texe Marrs' Die America Die DVD,"Here are facts not found in filtered media that affect the survival of America, which every citizen should know. There is a need for honest members of Congress who will initiate an investigation into the Federal Reserve, the ATF, and EPA."
5,Die America Die,Rapid fire expose of who and what is at the heart of the destruction of America!You did it again Texe!
5,Die America Die,A must see Great documentary! May God protect Texe Marrs for telling the truth about what is really going on in America.
5,Truth all should know,This man has his FACTS straight. Hope the word will spread and people will awaken if it's not already too late. Buy it share it!
3,"Technically Excellent, but a lot of filler material.","On this, his third CD, Trace Adkins actually sounds even better than usual, and the recording is extremely fine. Unfortunately, except for the title track, ""Don't Lie""(vocally striking), and ""Someday,"" - the remainder of this album is rather trite and forgettable. Trace's voice is awesome, as usual, but please, Trace - get some better advice on your material, and be more inventive and original! This CD is actually inferior overall compared with his first two, strictly on the merits of the material. Those first two had some really outstanding songs - He'll be lucky to get one or two hits off of this CD. Trace needs some higher quality material to showcase his outstanding voice."
1,Be advised...Better you do not even think of buying a Sony,"This is my second Sony Trinitron. Now this one has fallen to the ""Sony kiss of death."" It keeps turning off and will not restart. It will run from a cold start for about 4-5 minutes and then die. I have gotten repair estimates of $200 -$300. for a 'possible' repair. This is a common problem with a poorly designed power supply that overheats. Sony truly built a defectively designed TV. I am finished with Sony. It is all baloney."
2,CRAP,"I bought my WEGA 1 1/2 months ago, and am now on my 3rd set. i'm taking it back tomorrow to get my money back and switched brands.the picture has alway been bright and vibrant, but we consistently had distortions at the top and bottom of each unit we had = problem 1.with every set - when a program goes to commercial, the screen is not black, but a charcoal color with faint white glow. this also is the case when watching a DVD. incredibly annoying = problem 2.we had a tv repair person come out each time to tell us what we already new - that he'd have to take it into the shop to fix it. i mean, how absurd is that! a tv is only 2 weeks old and i'm supposed to pay to repair it!!!?i will never buy a sony tv again!"
2,Very disappointed,"Screen is blurry around the edges and corners, most obvious with text (i.e. ESPN sports ticker, movie credits, etc.). Equally bad for satellite/cable TV, DVD, and Playstation. Perhaps I should have returned it, but I had to destroy the box to get it home. I do not recommend this TV. Get a Samsung instead."
2,Would be Great if I had the TV,"When I received my TV Broken I Spoke to customer service right away. They told me that they would email the shipping information that day so I could return the Broken TV And would get a NEW TV when the Broken one had been Delivered. I Shipped it Back the next day. I waited six days to hear/receive anything. I called support again, They said that they would not be resending a TV, But a Credit to my account. I Did not want a Credit, I wanted a New TV. I was told that I would have to wait Nine days for the Broken TV to Be Credited to my Account. I still have no NEW TV. Thanks For the Inconvenience."
2,High pitched noise for a great tv,"I bought this tv from CC and had high hope for it. A $350 Sony 27"" flat screen? what a steal right?Well.. maybe...if you have a big house or bad hearing..The high pitched noise from the back of the tv is so annoying, i never felt happier turning OFF the tv! its like a better version of nails on blackboard... i have to exchange it to another tv thats not as good graphic wise as the Sony.What a shame, i love everything else about this tv.."
3,Almost Perfect,"I own two 27"" Sony Wega TVs. The first one that I bought a couple of years ago is excellent. It is the higher end model with all the bells and whistles (PIP etc).The other one (KV27FS100) I bought last month and am somewhat disappointed with it. There is a distortion at the bottom of the screen. When I view my Satellite TV guide, there is a slope that goes from left to right. Also, if there is a banner that scrolls accross the bottom of the screen (like the one on the news networks), it appears all squigley and distorted.That problem did not arise on my first 27"" Wega. I am not sure if it is a inconsistency in the manufacturing or if the quality control is just poor.This problem withstanding, the features on this model are easy to use and the remote is wonderful. I would still recommend the WEGA, but just wanted to caution future comsumers of the picture problem (which appears in a couple of other reviews on Amazon)."
2,GREAT WHEN IT WORKS,"I purchased mine 9 months ago and it worked perfectly for 7 months.Of course, now that it's out of warranty all sorts of problems have arisen. Primarily, it has a mind of it's own.While watching a program, the set tries to re-set itself and jumps from input to input for no reason whatsoever.I've read the manual four times and have contacted Sony all to no avail.Just have have a service tech come to my home is $70. Tack on what will surely be several hundred dollars for the repair (with no assurance that the problem will go away without 4 more visits, if at all) and I've decided to simply throw a $500 set in the garbage.For what it's worth, the picture on this set is fantastic. Especially with a DVD and component cables.I just think that for $500 I should have gotten a set with a warranty a lot longer than 90 days for labor.Never again will I touch a Sony product. I'm on my way to buy a Toshiba this afternoon.Buy this piece of junk at your own risk."
3,Good bang for buck tv,"I got a great deal on the TV so buying it wasn't really a tough decision. I've only had it a few days, and so far I'm happy with the purchase. I have one downfall to point out though -> the blacks and greys of the picture seem really grainy on most channels and some of the DVD's I've tried. Could be I've just gotten used to my sony monitor's resolution."
5,nothing better,"i tried really hard to find something better. I didn't want to buy this set as I would be paying a premium for the Sony name (as opposed to paying for quality and features). I stood in front of numerous TV's at the local store trying to get the Toshiba and Samsung to have the same picture, and the Sony beat them hands down. As soon as this set went on sale, I snatched it up."
3,Disappointed,"Got the 27FS100 at CC and compared it to my 24in 24FV12 (side by side feeding the same signal through my Panny 56) and black cut away scenes are ""chorcoal"" compared to my 24in (which are black). Whites are whiter on my 24in and colors are more intense and vivid on the 24FV12. Maybe Sony's QC isn't what it use to be."
3,Okay,But it could still use more reinforcements. Remember that this product doesn't have a closing flap!
4,Works for us,"We were looking for a dual head shower spray and were put off by the excessively pricey one's at the local home stores. So we bought this for a price even cheaper than here thinking it would be hit or miss. Well, it's two years later and it's going strong. Works great. Feels great. Installed in seconds. Very pleased!"
5,"niagara ""freaking"" falls",this is a great showerhead. the only downside is that it puts out so much water that it literally drains all the hot water out of my hotwater tank. or maybe i spend too much time in the shower. great product!
5,Great pressure and water flow,"I have had this shower head for more than ten years, if I move it moves with me. No one in my family can shower with out it!I have one for every shower in my house"
1,Pure Drivel,"... I found the entire CD painful. This isnt a tribute ... And even I who loves everything that Radiohead has ever put out, figured I would give it a try. I thought since they had such good material to work with they couldnt possibly destroy it..."
1,If only...,"It's a shame that there were no better electronic artists to craft what has, in principle, such great potential for brilliance. Remixes of Radiohead? It could be wonderous---but it flounders miserably under the hands of half-baked excuses for electronic musicians with little musical or lyrical talent. Please, if you are unfamiliar with the realm of electronic, don't judge the genre by this tragic representation. (For examples of better remixes, try Plaid remixing Bjork, or Underworld remixing whatever)"
1,Blah,"An attempt to electrify Radiohead is like trying to add weight to Shaquile O'Neal. The blend of mind drilling beats laid over sped up lyrics and distorted chord progressions destroys the overall purpose of the music. Even open minded Radiohead fans will listen to this and cringe... How can you take music that is deeply entrenched in worthwhile lyrics, soul, blues, and emotion and attempt to fit it into a dance club sound. If you want this sound, get a Radiohead RECORD and play it on double speed while banging a few pots and pans--at least the experience will involve the listener this way, rather than lulling them to sleep with miserable clubed out vocals.BEWARE this CD stinks."
2,abuse of the Radiohead name,"Now, honestly. The only reason I picked this up without even thinking twice is because it had Radiohead in the title. What a mistake.Out of the 12 tracks on the CD, maybe 2-3 have an interesting twist on the original. The rest, well, as a previous reviewer said, we don't need a remix of Fitter Happier.Avoid it. It's noise."
2,I expected more,"You have to be over creative to re create on RadioHead - Strung Out on Ok Computer AND Exit Music a re-workings of classics from sa-ra, matthew herbert, sia, cinematic orquestra and others... Are good examples of very good re creations"
1,This is bad. Are they making fun of Radiohead or what?,"This seems like a parody album. I was looking to see if Weird Al was involved but alas, he was not. Maybe he should've been but it was so bad it was an insult to Radiohead. The first track set a milestone as far as bad covers are concerned. There should be a law about which people can purchase samplers and drum machines and which ones are allowed to sing. These ""artists"" should be required to write a formal apology to the band Radiohead and their fans."
2,"Horrible, stay away from this !","Oviously, this Radiohead remix CD is VERY bad. For example, Exit Music (For a Film) was originally a sad ballad with lots of guitars ; it was transformed into some kind of techno boum-tchika-boum song, which is horrible and doesn't keep the song's spirit, even remotely."
4,Incredibly creative versions...,Why do an album of unimaginative cover songs? What would be the point in that? The artists on this album obviously are fans of Radiohead and seemed to have been given total creative license on the way the covers were done. Each song is given a creative twist and taken to another place entirely. Very cool for fans of Radiohead and for fans of electronica...
5,WOW,"Wow.... I am stoked...whatver that means. The first time I heard this CD I was blown away. It has that whole strange and weird vibe to it. For people who like Kid A, you are going to LOVE this one. The makers of this CD have taken the whole weird thing a step further and they have done it PERFECTLY!Take my advice. BUY THIS RECORD! Excellent"
2,damaged goods,I have not had trouble ordering through Amazon before but this product arrived damaged. I would like to know how to return it and receive a new shipment.
2,My Yorkie Won't Eat Them,"The ingredients are all good, but my Yorkie will only play with these treats....not eat them. Buy Newman's chicken treats instead."
5,Stunning pageant earrings,"I have worn these beautiful earrings since 2007. They were just right for pageants, and when I won, they complemented my crown perfectly. They are substantially sized but not gaudy.I like that they're sterling, so I can wear them to formal events for years to come."
1,Second-rate and tacky.,"Extremely uninspired. At best, this is elevator music at a mid priced hotel next to a minor domestic airport."
2,Did not charm the snake...,"I'm a big fan of Liebert's music, so I bought this dvd expecting to listen to it peacefully at home trying to relax myself, only to be INTERRUPTED by a comentary in the middle of my favorite song ""snake charmer"" what a shame... With this dvd you just have to skip and skip in order to find the music...Also, I find it just too short, just about six songs...very dissapointed."
3,Interviews interrupt the music,I agree with everyone about the quality of the recording and performance. The problem that is all too common with music on video is the talk that interrupts the flow of the music. Even worse is when a tune is cut short so we can hear talk. DVD has the capability of alternative tracks so one can hear the interesting talk when desired. I doubt anyone will desire to hear this great music interrupted by talk on each playing. This seriously compromises the enjoyment that would have been so much greater with this beautiful performance.
3,nice atmospheres and good musicians,Ottmar is one of the best guitarrists in the nouveau flamenco. He plays alive with his band acoustic music with percussions. Nothing to say about the quality of compositions but all the tracks are so similar (the style is this...) so all the concert is not boring but it's better if you are a good fan. Among the songs there are some interviews with Ottmar in which he tells something about him and his life. A good dvd for a romantic night and for whom loves this music.
4,I watched it and had to buy it...,"Ordered this from Netflix, and had to own it. Commentary is part of video, and there are plenty of uninterrupted songs here. I was glad for the explanations, and insights as to how Ottmar writes.If you are a guitarist, instrumental musician or arranger, you will find this fascinating. The simplicity of the arranging mixed with the skill of the musicians comes across beautifully.I will use this as an example for my students.Great experience..."
4,Peer into the Soul of a Jury,"I can't say I enjoyed this book, because it's not a subject that is enjoyable, but it is insightful to look into the minds of twelve individuals and see how their opinions and personalities are shaped, what their prejudices are, how they reason."
5,great book.,"I read this book in my work as an attorney, but recommend it to anyone looking for insight into the legal system and how juries decide cases. Extremely thought provoking."
3,Just OK,"This lamp is no more & no less than described.Pros : I like the full-spectrum lighting. Nice & white & it makes every other lightbulb in the room look yellowish.Cons: Replacement bulbs are $9.00. Only takes a few and you've doubled the cost of the lamp itself. Also I thought I was ordering a black one and it came in white. Not annoying enough to bother with returning it, but when I repeated the order as a test, I found nowhere does it ask you to choose a color."
1,Premature Failure,Within two weeks of receiving the lamp the ballast burned out. Grandrich sent a new one which was DOA. Another replacement ballast along with the attaching connectors was supposed to be sent. Numerous follow-up calls and e-mails to Grandrich inquiring about the status of the latest replacement have gone unanswered. It appears that this is a product quality issue as well as poor customer service.
1,The replacement bulb costs more than a basic desk lamp from Target!,This bulb did not last long at all so I feel ripped off. I don't feel like throwing good money after bad so I would rather go back to normal lamps using normal bulbs from now on. I am chucking this lamp.
1,Not worth,It dint glow for more than four hours. Just used it twice in 2 days. 2 hours on one and 2 hours on another day. It dint remain for the third time.
5,Bright light for study time.,"I had this lamp since 2009 and I absolutely love it. I use it almost every night. This light is very bright which is exactly what I was looking for when I needed to get serious during study time without falling asleep., but after reading the negative reviews I'm even afraid to order a second one even after absolutely loving my lamp I don't know how I ever studied without this lamp ohh yeah I used to study in the kitchen table . I will look around just for sakes but I am 99% sure I will buy me a second one hope is not a manufacture defective issue with that the newer models."
5,Great Lamp for the price,I received this lamp about a month or so ago and have been very pleased with it. It provides more then enough desk light for my computer without all the heat I was getting from my Halogen lamp.
4,"Good, but weird clicking noise","Overall, this lamp was a good buy. It provides good lighting and it was relatively cheap compared to Verilux. However, 5 minutes after I turn it on, it makes this sound as if a rubber band had hit it. I think it might be the metal prongs that are supposed to hold the bulb in place. The prongs are really poorly made and don't fit the bulb so if you shove it into place, it'll fit somewhat sideways. I'm guessing after I turn it on, the bulb somehow pops out of the prongs, but it doesn't fall out of the lamp so it's not a big problem."
1,It was great while it lasted!,"I bought one of these from Amazon in November of 2009. I used it only once in a while, and never for more than a few minutes at a time. Then, a couple of months ago, it quit, so, thinking it was surely just a burned-out bulb, I ordered and received two replacements from Amazon. Tried BOTH of them and got NOTHING! This probably means that the lamp itself is bad, so I'm flat out of luck...having spent forty bucks for the POS lamp and now another small bundle for replacement bulbs I can't use.So what do I do now...buy another lamp?Nah...my mama didn't raise no fools! I'll go get myself a Walmart lamp and screw a ""twisty"" into it."
1,Lemon,"The table lamp worked great for two months before it died. I purchased another bulb thinking it was bad, but found that the problem was with the lamp. This product is not worth the time and money to repair."
1,Poor company,"Although I did not purchase this particular lamp (I purchased the floor model), I would warn potential customers to be sure to save their receipt for any purchase from this company. If you are buying the lamp used, it might be a problem. The lamp I purchased was a $50 lamp made by the same company and it didn't last one month before blowing the circuit panel, which had to be replaced at our expense. I had misplaced the receipt and the company would not honor my word, so we had to pay for the part and the shipping. My husband, who is a very good handyman, was able to install the part himself, but I don't think just anyone could have done that."
1,do not buy this product,"Never buy this product. I received it on March 16, 2011. It worked well in the first three days, but now it stopped working (I do not know whether the bulb is out or something else is wrong). Remember that today is just March 20, 2011. I will return it tomorrow"
2,Transformer died,"I loved this lamp until it stopped working after 8 months of use. I bought a new bulb which didn't help, so I called the Grandrich company. They told me that it was probably the transformer and they would send me a free replacement. It turned out to be very complicated to install, so after a struggle, I gave up and bought a new lamp as it was simply not worth the time and effort involved. I find it greatly disappointing that it lasted for such a short time, and I would not recommend."
2,"Oversized lamp, cheap plastic look","When this thing shipped to me i just plain hated it.1. Lamp looks nice on the picture, but in real life plastic that its made of looks really cheap2. Though i approximated the dimensions when i bought it, the lamp turned out to be HUGE3. The lamp is huge, but the CORD is very very SHORT, about 2,5ft only.4. The bulb is DIM5. I keep it tho, primarily because even if I'd like to return it, the shipping is at my own cost. I checked out with the USPS, and they estimated it to be around $15, about the half price i paid for the lamp. So i keep it, this ugliest thing I've ever owned in my life."
4,great lamp,"This gives off the best light for reading! I have it on the nightstand next to my bed. It may not be the most attractive lamp and it is a bit large, but for the money, it can't be beat."
2,poor contact,"very poor contact , its power switch malfunction just after I used it for about a month.I am now connect with the company and wating for an answer ."
1,Stopped working in 8 months. Bad product.,"I bought this in September 2010. I actually bought two of them. One is still working, and one just died. I thought it was the bulb so I bought a replacement but found out it was the lamp. Doesn't matter how cheap it is, if it lasts less than a year, it's just garbage. I see many other reviews of folks with the same issue. Buyer beware."
1,Stopped working!,This thing worked great for about six months. Then I had to flip the switch on and off dozens of times before it would come on. Now it doesn't work at all. Junk.
4,Pleased,I was pleased with this item. It serves as a desk lamp in my office; provides more than adequate light; and is good quality for the price.
3,OK LAMP....WRONG COLOR SHIPPED,"The lamp is as expected, except Amazon shipped a color other than the one ordered."
3,Not much worth the price,"The good is it does provide decent light and has a heavy base. However, the craftsmanship can not worth this price. Besides, the installation is not that easy."
3,"Bright Lamp, Too Much Glare","This is a very bright lamp and is good for a lot of things except for reading. It puts too much of a glare on my pages and is really frustrating. I have moved it a few feet higher and further back and it seemed to have helped a little, but there is still a very distracting glare. I am currently in the market for a good glare-free desk/reading lamp."
5,"Clear and bright, No glare light","This lamp is wonderful. I bought it to use at my desk and work table when I am making beaded jewelry, and I use it every day for general lighting on my desk. The price was right, too-- and I know I can easily replace the bulb, which was a problem with another full spectrum light I had."
4,Why pay more?,"I am very satisfied with the price and quality of this reading lamp. The other, similar, lamps cost twice as much, if you really have too much $ to waste. This is also a good gift for students and people who read a lot. Remember too, this lamp doesnt generate heat, so it's also good to read by in summers."
2,Awesome while it lasted,"Got this mug for my B-day over a year ago. It was by far my favorite beverage glass, kept beer ice cold and frosty for a couple hours. I just recently poured a cold beer and the cup completely split in half... It was great while it lasted"
5,best gift,my brother-in-law was surprised and thrilled with his favorite team mug. I know that he will be using it when his team plays. I intend on ordering more of these for myself and for gifts.
5,The best freezer cups!,I love these cups because they are so durable and really keep your drinks cold. Also they represent the best NFL team ever! Go 49ers!!!!!!
4,A good book for comparing aircraft models,"If your looking for one book to read before buying an airplane, then dont buy an airplane. You have to read EVERY book you can get your hands on plus lots of Trade a Planes, and spend a year or more looking before you buy a plane. When it comes to aircraft, you must know all you can about your purchase or it can break you. I know this because I am an Aircraft Mechanic.This book does give you a basic knowledge of whats involved in buying a plane and basic data about each model shown. Unfortunatly books are never accruate price guides because values change quickly. They do give a prospective buyer lots to think about.It is a great read for aviation buffs who want to compare different models of light singles and twins. I spent hours thumbing thru it. Would have liked color pictures but there is at least one picture and specifications for pretty much every production light aircraft."
2,Not that good,"I was rather disappointed in this tool set, as I have a set of Por Grade ratchets that I really like. The sockets and ratchets are ok, the tool chest is ok, but the renches and other tools are sort of a joke. There are a lot better deals for better tools out there."
3,Not for Beginners!,"While I saw merit in the lessons contained on this DVD, I felt that the lesson plan went from ""here's a tin whistle"" to ""here's a fairly complex tune at pace"" in one chapter. I play Great Highland Bagpipes and one thing I've learned is that playing slowly, then working up to speed is paramount to proper learning. My recommendation is that, if you already play and want to learn a couple of tunes and watch Vinnie play, this is your vid. If you want to LEARN how to play, better to wait on this one!"
5,A Great Reference on DSL even if not perfect,"Although certainly not perfect, as it is not very well unified, it is one of the best books available on DSL.Even though it appears as if each author wrote their seperate section and it was never well integrated, there is information here on the DSLs that is not available in one place anywhere else. A wonderful reference on modem design, the issues of deploying DSL, and the standards process."
3,Not great but the only decent book around,"If there were enough books on this technology out there in the market, I'd probably have given this only one star. This book seems like something in between a marketting white paper and an engineering reference. The material is not clearly organized. The author keeps throwing a lot of equations at you without clearly pointing out where they come from and what are their implications. It covers almost all aspects of the DSL technology but doesn't cover anything adequately. The discussion is usually abstruse and ends abruptly. As a DSP design engineer working in this area, I was never able to find much valueable information in this book. Nevertheless, this is the best title I could find from whatever is out there."
3,"not enough books avilable about DSL, good one","Well I bought Three books about DSL , this one was one of them. the other books I bought was ""xDSL Architecture"" and "" ADSL/VDSL Technologies"" "" the Understanding and ADSL/VDSL both books all the time talks about Technical Data and specifications, have lots of sophisticated equations. I am not saying that they are bad, but the xDSL architecture is the best choice for me, but still if you need very deep information you gotta have one of ther two books. in my case I returned the Book ""Understanding ... "" to Amazon and I kept the other two books."
3,A good first attempt,"This is a good first attempt by Dewalt at making an adjustable-depth setter. It does the job but marks up the workpiece because the body does not rotate freely. As you reach the desired depth, the outer body rotates against the work piece and leaves a ring-shaped mark/indentation around your screw.This doesn't matter much for drywall since it will be spackled and painted anyway. But for general woodworking this needs to be redesigned, so that the outer body rotates freely."
4,Just what i wanted,"It gave me new spells and new campaign ideas. it was what i wanted, so I am very happy with this product."
5,Nice Rack,This is a very solidly built Hitch Mount bike rack. It does exactly what it claims (holds 2 bikes) and it does it well. I know that I will have this mount longer than I have my current vehicle. I would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again.
1,Worst bike rack ever!,"I have been biking/kayaking for years and have used a variety of products for transportation and this is by far the worst bike rack I have ever seen/used! First, the rack connects to the car with a washer and bolt, so it needs to be re-installed every use, rather than a generic bolt that works with a tow ball. While the product is on the car, the trunk cannot be opened or shut (we have a hatchback). Also there are two other bolts used to construct the rack and each one requires a different size wrench. Its annoying to set up and is not meant to be setup/removed regularly."
3,Quality Workmanship,"I purchased this because it is made in the USA. Although very pleased with the quality and workmanship, I was rather disappointed with the fact that you need to remove a bolt to lower the top arms. I know it's not a big deal, but I was so irritated I actually thought of returning it. I was able to purchase a 2 3/4"" pin at Lowes which works fine in place of the bolt so decided to keep it."
4,Well worth it,"I really like this bike rack. Taking the bike on and off is simple. However, the bike does slide because the rubber craddles are not stationary and I am unable to open my rear door entirely but enough to access my stuff."
2,junk,"The only reason it got two stars is because, technically, it does carry bikes. First, the arms don't fold down without taking out a bolt with a lock nut (so a wrench is needed). Second, not sure what the design concept is with the receiver. A bolt that goes through one side of the receiver and one side of the rack, and not through either of the other side?"
1,boring,"I loved this popular song, but the other additions are weak, boring and stupid;. I am sorry... i love ur George, but this one seems like it was rushed, I didn't like it at all. the other salsa version has him jsut inserting some shout outs and the regaaee version is soo pathetic. I would not recommend it at all. buy his whol cd, entrega."
1,Between this and MTV we have the realness,The Best on show on Tv ever has to have a poster this show is awesome it is better then Friends-Seinfeld-Mash-Frasier combined all of those shows just suck. and this show is just the coolest that one dude is a pure thug strait out of the O.C. man if that guy lived in Big L's neighborhood he would smoke all of the homies because these dudes are the hardest guys of all time. And that one girl is just so hot with her anarexia I am sure she has. All of the guys are thugs and all of the girls are cool to. This show has to be the realest man. This is way up there with Lil Flip and some rock singers like Good Charlotte.This is definantly the best show on TV and is the pure realities of are life. Why don't these guys go Big L neighborhood and see how many they can beat up. The Reality is stay a million miles away from this show.
2,Amazon Packing Stinks!!!,"This expensive corner desk is so poorly packed and shipped by Amazon that I had to get two of them sent to me just so that I could swap out the damaged parts from each package to come up with one good desk. Then I had to lug this thing to my local UPS store to ship back the damaged box of pieces back to Amazon....what a pain!!! If you have to have this desk then try to buy it from a place where you can pick it up yourself, you'll save your back a lot of pain and your mind a lot of frustration.In regard to the desk, note that it's not completely reversible....only the desktop and the shelves are reversible, otherwise everything is dark brown, not ""light oak"". This isn't bad if you want a dark brown desk, but we ended up having to ""make do"" with an expensive desk that wasn't exactly the color we wanted.oh well....we learned a lesson here....hopefully you'll learn from our experience"
3,Analysis,"This book is good if you have no clue about the role that intangibles (investor sentiment, momentum, etc.) play on a security's price fluctuations. There are plenty of good cliches about how a stock is priced. But other than that, I gained nothing in terms of actual technical analysis skill. The author spent too much time arguing the validity of using technical data with fundamentals which I would assume anyone who purchased the book, already knew there is value in technical analysis."
3,A decent book for starters,"I am more interested in books that marry financial and technical analysis. Kahn does a reasonable attempt at that. Some reviewers mention this book is a bit on the basic side. I would have them look at the title and what it suggests the book is trying to accomplish, i.e. a simple and plain review of technical analysis. That it does quite well."
4,Amazons customer treatment,When I ordered this book I also order another book and my total was over $25 dollars so I qualified for free shipping. Well Amazon couldn't find my other book and cancelled that part of the order and charged me shipping for this book.Bad Form Amazon!!It wasn't my fault that you failed to provide the product that I agreed to buy. A company looking to increase its good will would have waived the shipping fee.
3,BEALLS IS HORRIBLE!,"If this product isn't what you want...BEALLS OF FLORIDA will not take care of your problem!Buy from a store that cares, not BEALLS!!"
3,Beautiful but fragile,"This watch is incredibly gorgeous. The petite mother of pearl face surrounded by diamonds is just to die for! However, the watch band is extremely delicate. Mine arrived broken so I had to give it back. Not a daily driver. A special occasion only watch."
3,Way bigger than it looks...,"We uaed ours to temporarily replace a delapidated kitchen cabinet -- without the wheels it was the exact same height. The two top drawers are ideal size, twice as deep as the average kitchen drawer; too much for a tray of silverware, but ideal for anything folded -- tablecloths, towels, etc. It's very sturdy, but somewhat awkward and heavy if it needs moving. The plastic ball casters require a perfectly clean, level surface to roll. Keeping anything heavy on the top will cause the surface to bow, making the top drawer difficult to open and close, but we knew this in advance. The unit sat ouside for 6 months while we built a new house and cleaned up easily with scrubbing bubbles and the hose. Presently it sits in a walk-in closet holding craft supplies in the 2 top drawers. The two bottom drawers are immense -- they now hold winter sweaters or blankets or beach towels, depending. I would recommend it to anyone based on it's intended use."
4,Good value for the price,"Inexpensive, easy storage option. Just don't put anything really heavy in the center of the top as it's light gauge plastic and will bend down in the middle and you'll have to shove on the top drawer to get it in. But this is not really a minus considering everything. I needed some storage cheap and you can also see into the drawers."
5,Works Great,"It works Great, had it for three years and as long as you have working batteries in them they work great.Update: It just died after we left it on the BBQ in a rain, sleet snow storm, Had to chip it off the BBQ due to ice... 5 years and User error destroyed it, now to buy another one...."
2,Second Chance,"This is great product when it works. This is the second go around, for 4, for this product given to various Family members, None of the first group is still working so we will see how round 2 does...JAK"
1,Probes don't last,"I loved this thing when it worked. Unfortunately, the temperature probes go out frequently and then the units give very strange readings. I've used my unit about 10 times and am currently on my third probe.I use mine for smoking, so theres not much heat and no flare ups. There are a lot of reveiws that complain of the same issue with the probes. If they could produce a reliable probe, this would be very good!!I didn't have any problems with anything but the defective probes."
4,Excellent... this is my second thermometer!,"When my kids ruined my last Oregon Scientific AW129, I liked it so much, I just ordered another one. It's a great system (but not to resistant to rough housing). I love it!"
1,Sensor has very poor durability,Similar to some other reviewers the probe quickly malfunctioned. A bbq probe should be designed to withstand heat and from the looks of it this one can't. I have sent this in for an exchange and hopefully have better luck with the second probe.
3,cable-to-base connection is loose,"The thermometer works well, and the first one we owned was great. The last two we purchased have had a loose fit where the cord plugs into the base unit, so it tends to fall out."
1,Poor radio connection,"Be it 5"", 5 ft, or 50 ft away, the remote would not accept a signal from the base station. This happened after one or two uses. No amount of resetting, re-powering or tinkering would make it work.I am fairly handy with electronics - this unit just had a bad radio or receiver. Not worth the hassle to exchange or fix, I finally just disappointedly through it in the trash."
4,Good Tool,I am writing this in response to several reviews that critisized the lack of control for various cooking temperatures. Actually there is a wide range of cooking temperatures if one ignores the recommended ranges for specific meats/fish. Beef starts at 135 degrees (rare) and poultry is fixed at 180 degrees. This effectively allows a range between 135 and 180 degrees which covers the gamut of doneness. I really like this tool.
1,Garbage,Well a month after Christmas was the first time I used this it was working fine despite I was loosing the signal from the transmitter from less than 20 feet away. When I was done using it my wife cleaned the probe with a lightly damp sponge with a little dish soap without submerging into water. Well that was the end of it after that. Now when you turn it on it reads 199 degrees F.Today I called their customer service department and the man there told me I have 2 choices. I can either BUY a replacement probe for $5 or I can return the entire unit for a replacement. The replacement unit sounded fair but I became annoyed of the thought of buying a part after using it once. He also wasn't overly friendly about the whole ordeal asking me if I abused it.
1,Unreliable and costly,I Bought this unit with great expectations. Within 4 months I have gone through 2 sensor probes which are costly to replace. The published upper temperature range is 485F. The last probe failed at 450F in a Big Green Egg Smoker/Grill when grilling chicken. The unit is very unreliable for grilling. I'm shopping for a more robust model.
1,Disposable unit.,"The first one never made it through the pig roast...Burned the probe up. Second one lasted the last 2 hours of the pig roast and went bad during a chicken BBQ. Not worth spending another 13 bucks to replace the probe. If you read this and still buy it anyways, come back and click the like button on this post when yours goes belly up."
2,Not for Real-Life Temps,"I'm going to garage-sale mine. I've used it for a few years now and it is barely adequate, especially with the built-in temperatures. The unit can only be used with an alarm if one chooses the built-in cooking temperatures. Trouble is, that the programmed temperatures are baloney, in some cases. The programmed temperatures are evidently based on the recommendations of government safety nerds and not on real-life cooking temps. I have not found any way to program in any other temperature, either.Functionally, it reads temperature. I have had a little trouble with the plug in probe: the plug seems to need fussing with to get it to seat and work properly. Once up and running, it does its other stuff with ease. The batteries seem to last long enough not to be a bother, too.Right now, I'm using their Oregon AW131 which has programmed temps and the ability to set one's custom temps. It is a much more satisfactory rig."
3,It does what little it does until it quits working,"I received this as a gift. First, I must say that the digital display does NOT read from 0 - 392 F The probe probably does but the remote display only goes to 200F and stays there. So if you stick it in the thermometer hole of your e.g. Big Green Egg and glance at it once an hour or so, on the nightstand, while trying to slow-smoke a brisket overnight, you'll be happy that the temp is holding at 200 but you'll be sadly misinformed. Meanwhile, the probes do what they do. Getting water inside the metal ruins one so don't use it as a ""pot watcher"" and burning through the insulation isn't good either. That's no big deal as I buy the same probes for my Taylor digital thermometers and this one, for $5 each free shipping. But, before the first battery died as in after about three years, it just stopped transmitting for no apparent reason, despite changing probes and batteries and everything. All at once and nothing first, from one month to another"
1,Great Idea - Did not work - defective,This is the third time I have bought this exact product over the last ten or more years. The first two lasted for several years each. This time the unit would not work right out of the box! I tried fresh batteries and resetting both units several times. I sent it back.
1,Junk and Waste of $ - Absolutely NO connection between transmitter and receiver,"What a waste of money. The handheld receiver just blinks continuously its ""no connection"" symbol (a blinking triangle). I've put new batteries in both the transmitter and receiver, and still no joy (and yes, both transmitter and receiver are on). Doesn't matter if they are right next to each other - still no connection. It is as though the transmitter is broadcasting on a different frequency than the receiver is tuned to. NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER.Buyer Be Warned - this made in China piece of crap should never have been accepted by Oregon Scientific (who otherwise has decent products)."
3,Rating uncertain. Dead on arrival,"The Oregon Scientific AW129 Wireless BBQ Thermometer holds great promise for a variety of uses. The company itself produces a number of innovative products and has a good name. Unfortunately, this product was dead out of the package. Their customer service did send a replacement without discussion. Have not yet taken it out of the package to use."
2,Worked great until probe failed.,"Like others, the probe failed on my unit. And, I can't seem to find any replacement probes available anywhere. OS's site is the only place I found it for sale and it's out of stock. For 6 months, it worked great, so I still gave it two stars."
1,Probe is the problem,"I got one of these as a gift about two years ago. I used it in my BBQ Grill for several weeks until the lid pinched the cable probe. Presto, it was dead. I went to the OS website; typed in the webform expecting to hear that a new proble under warrenty was on the way. Never did. This thing is still laying around the house, so I checked today to see if I could buy a probe; you can!!!!!! Just $12.99 plus 9.95 shipping. Here on Amazon, you can purchase a new/used one for that price.Too bad, the concept is terriffic and while it worked it was wonderful. OS needs to put some armor on the cable, put two in the box, and make replacements that ship to your door $10.My last piece of OS gear."
1,Failed on second use.,"The concept on this thing is great. But they don't make the lead wire to the probe armored enough to withstand either the heat or the lid 0f the BBQ squishing it. Ours failed on the second use. These are the same guys who make this for Weber Grills. Theirs had the same problem, but they issued a free heavier duty one. It lasted about two years then failed. Same thing."
1,Doesn't work after the 3rd use.,"I bought this to use with my smoker. There is a dedicated hole in the smoker for the cable to go through. The probe cable has never been pinched in a door. Maximum temperature of my smoker when using this probe never exceeded 225 F. The probe or the cable has never been exposed to a flame. The display unit now shows the probe temperature floating between 130-140 F whether the probe is exposed to ice water, room temperature or 220 F in my smoker. It's headed to the garbage can. I'm kicking myself for not heeding the warnings from the reviews."
3,"NIce Product, Expensive Replacement.","The item works great. Except the very first time I used it, I scorched the wires for the sensor. (I'm not a great griller). Anyway, the replacement part is $9.99 through the manufacturer and their shipping cost is outrageous, $9.95, nearly the same cost as the replacement part."
1,Got a bad Unit,"I purchase this unit and it does not work, it registered a temp one time and then quit working, I have called to get a replacement but no luck, I did talk to a rep that told me that there was a reset button, tried that worked once and then quit. Not real happy about this product, wish I could get it replaced, maybe I just got a lemon."
1,Piece of Junk,"Believe the reviews, this product is junk. When it worked, it was awesome to be able to hang out inside the house with guests and not worry about my food on the grill. But I've been through two of these now and both stopped working after 2-3 uses. One would no longer make the wireless connection and the other just started reading bizarre incorrect temperatures. When I returned it to the OS store at the mall, they didn't act the least bit surprised this happened.Consider yourself warned."
1,Looks like ...,I never even opened the package as it is the exact same one that I just sent back with the WEBER name on it that didn't work.Is this a joke??
2,Idea Great - Probes Not Great,"The unit generally works well and the concept is great. The problem is that the probes fail easily, making the unit worthless. In researching, I read that the probes fail when exposed to ""high"" temperature - like flare ups on the grill. This makes sense. Mine worked well in the oven and I have rarely even gotten it damp. But the couple of times probes failed on the BBQ I bet there were flames. This makes the design poor. They should have expected flames on a grill and made the probes more temperature resistant."
1,Don't do it,"For thermometer marketed as a grill thermometer what a joke.The first time you expose the probe to a flare up, no matter how small, the probe is ruined and the unit will tell you the temp is 199 degrees.It's cheaper to buy the entire unit again than buying a replacement probe, and you have to many times.JUNK ALL WAY!"
1,"Hate to say it, but...piece of junk","We used ours once or twice. Then didn't use it for a while. When we went back to use it again, we couldn't get it to work, no matter what we tried. Guess it will end up in some garage pile (ugh!)...wouldn't recommend"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I WAS HOPING THAT THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS WERE WRONG, BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME. THE THERMOMETER SEEMED TO WORK WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX, BUT HALFWAY THROUGH USING IT THE FIRST TIME, IT STARTED BEEPING INCESSANTLY. I TRIED THE RESET BUTTONS ON BOTH THE TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER BUT NO LUCK - THE THING JUST KEEPS BEEPING AND FLASHING 199 DEGREES. NOT ONLY WAS THE MANUFACTURER NOT ABLE TO OFFER ANY TROUBLESHOOTING HELP WHATSOEVER, BUT THEY WANTED ME TO PAY TO SHIP THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCT BACK TO THEM FOR REPLACEMENT."
2,oregon scientific bad,"I have several temp probes and liked everything about this probe except one thing: the probe connection to the pod was way too loose. The slightest jarring disconnected the probe. After reattaching it several times during one roast, I gave up."
3,probe cable problem,"I purchase this device about 2 years ago. Very useful and operate well - large screen, wireless.You can control your meet temperature and free to walk out from kitchen.Device was user only indoors and not too often. I was very careful remember about sensor cable problems.Now it dead - show me temperature 199F and beeping continuously.After testing I find that probe (or its cable) defective. Go online for for replacement - with shippingOregon Scientific charge about [...]. Its too much for just simple badly designed probe.This one will go to the garbage and I will go for another brand."
1,Completely Dissatisfied!!!,"I bought two units at the same time. One of the units worked the first time and on subsequent use, the unit registered 199 degrees. Checking the manufacturer's website, this means the probe is damaged and needs to be replaced. The second unit did not work even on the first try. I want to send these useless thermometers back for a full refund. I would never buy this brand again."
4,Killer Gadget,Have bought this item for several friends and family members. I have never heard any complaints and still use my original version purchased in 2009. Reading the directions is key... have called their customer service number in past on other product and got the answers I needed!
2,Worked OK for a while,"Can't recommend this one. Its range is too limiting and not accurate. I never got it to register over 199 degrees while my old fashioned oven thermometer says its 350 (it says it will go to 392). Fine for meat but sometimes like to know other temps such as grease temps and the like.Also you can't turn off the alarm. I like to know what the temp is and want to set it without having the alarm come on. I could go on and on about the limitations.NOWIt worked OK for a while then, when I have company coming over.... refuses to work at all. Thought it was the batteries but no luck. Piece of junk now. I'm out to find something more versatile and that works.11-20-2012I have added back one star as it has begun to work again. I left the batteries out for a while and now seems to be communicating again. The rest of the review still is valid."
5,Great indoors or out,"I've been using this for about a year now and it's been great. We use it in the oven and on the grill. We grill all year long, so it comes in handy when it's 105 outside or 45. I really don't want to go out there and lift the lid, letting heat out or heating me up even more. And in the oven it's easier to use than dragging the meat out and probing it, then putting it back in. I just set it and let the beeps tell me when it's ready. I've tested it against my instant read chef's thermometer (which has been verified) and it's as close as I can tell. It's easy to use, I don't have to pick up the meat while it's cooking and hope I get the center. And I don't have to set a timer to check it (and get a piece of beef jerky when I forget to set the timer, done that).It's a great product. We're on our second one. I put the first one up someplace and still can't find it."
2,Smokers Beware,"If you are using this as intended (for internal meat temp) then I'm sure it will be fine for you. However, if you are using it to monitor your smoker's cooker box temp, you will be disappointed because though the probe is safe to use up to 482F, the monitor will only display up to 199!This is the second remote temp monitor to have some kind of funky drawback that could not be discerned from the description that makes it totally worthless for smoking."
1,Piece of junk,"Oregon Scientific AW129 Wireless BBQ Thermometer with Probe Thermometer and RemoteDon't waste your money. The ""good"" reviews were probably written by staff at OS. I have never had an OS product fail after the first use. When the probe goes out you can order another for $23 (including shipping). All of the other negative reviews are right on so I won't waste space."
2,does not work as advertised,"I used this item for the first time on ""drunkin chicken"" (whole chicken) and I tested it several times in several places on the chicken. It registered done (180) but when I cut the chicken open to serve it was not done. I am VERY disappointed."
3,Nice product with only one major flaw,I agree with the previous reviews -I bought this looking for a replacement of my Nutemp NU-701 I got years ago at Costco who's major flaw is no off switch so you have to replace batteriesThis OS AW129 has a nice range and doubly nice that it gives you audible notification when it goes out of range. BUT one major flaw that keeps me looking for better - you are limited to the pre-set alarm temperatures. The alarm temps listed for the various meats are not what many experts recommend for barbecuing and oven cooking ('Cook's Illustrated' for one) and there is no way to set your own. A major negative that is keeping me looking for something better.
1,Same 199 degree problem,Used the grill alert twice. Third time out of the box it registered the 199 degrees with the incessant beeping which would not reset. Piece of junk. Just pitched mine after reading reviews by others.
1,Does Not Last . . . ??,"As other reviewers, I have and like other OS products. However, this one only lasted about 4 uses. The temperature no longer reports correctly from the remote sensor to the monitor if it reports at all. Very disappointing!2/1/2009Hit all the reset buttons and fiddled with the batteries. The thing has a life again . . . go figure!!"
1,"Worked once, then died; no customer service response","I got this on sale last year for about $23. I thought it was a good deal at first, but I got what I paid for. I used it once in January, then decided it was too cold to grill out. So I took the batteries out and put it away until May. When I put the batteries back in, the remote base turned on, but the main unit would not. I tried a different set of batteries, but that didn't help either. Resetting and re-connecting the devices (as the manual suggested) was useless, because the unit just wouldn't power up. I sent an email through Oregon Scientific's website (because there's not a phone number to be found), and received no response. Well, if you count an auto-generated ""thanks for your inquiry"" type email, they did send that. After this poor experience, I will not buy another Oregon Scientific product."
1,Used 4 times and Useless.,"The probe failed after probably four uses. I was careful with it, but obviously not careful enough. Whoever heard of being careful with BBQ tools anyway? As with so many other people who have posted here, it appears the probe on my unit has failed.Interesting side note: I have been emailing back and forth with customer service, and they have me going through all these gyrations to try and get it to work. I finally looked here and diagnosed my own problem (and its lack of solution) in two minutes. You'd think they'd read their own reviews."
4,Ok,"Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but every time I make these, they crack more than any other bean I've ever made and they turn out dry in consistency. Otherwise, they have a great flavor and are from a great brand."
5,Hard to find,"These are good beans and I was happy to be able to get them here in a dry form, in quantities that are just right."
1,These beans were not good!,"I read the reviews carefully and decided to ignore the one negative review which addressed the flavor and the skins.I wish I had paid attention. I too know how to soak and use dried beans in soups. Following my usual recipe I found these beans were flavorless, possessed hard split shells, and were expensive. The white Navy beans I had been using were better in every way. I had to buy a lot of them so I will trash the remainder. I would not give them away to any friend of mine!"
3,Nice detail but small,"These were more detailed and smaller than I anticipated, and likely too much so for some needlework. Still, the fairies, which tend toward the child-like, are nicely done."
5,Just what the architecture soul needs,"After days of a dry spell, in trying to figure out a design problem; I started to flip through this fabulous book. Maya Lin's Boundaries; is a book that is food for the soul of an architect. Ironically, the title of the book is Boundaries, but the whole essence and poetic journey allows for one to see the world with out ""Boundaries"".Traveling through each project, Lin is able to take us from her thought process through a complete execution on each project. She is so delicate in describing each event, from growing up, the Vietnam memorial, to her goals in the future. The reader can travel with her, through each process, struggle, and creating architecture that is able to resonate within it's setting.Thinking with her hands, Lin describes each event, each challenge, and solution, allowing for the the reader to gain an inside, touching the souls of what every architect and designer needs."
5,The Best Book on BOTH Subjects!,"Bishop Leadbeater points out why anybody working with the Occult cannot eat the flesh of other living beings. He makes it clear that the stain on one's soul for causing such suffering to others renders one unfit for occult studies. His is yet another argument for why causing the suffering of other living beings is wrong, not just for altruistic reasons but because of the harm that one does to oneself. I highly recommend this book for anybody who is working in the Occult. With the discipline necessary for mastering those studies, it should be easy to add a switch to a vegetarian diet to the list of requirements. If you don't have the discipline to become a vegetarian or vegan, then you don't belong in the world of the Occult. Leadbeater doesn't mince his words at all. Witches and Ceremonial Magicians, take heed."
1,very cheap and fragile,"Nearly one time use, hard to mount, easily breaks if you just tight the screws a bit. Do yourself a favor and buy a better one."
5,An Excellent Introduction to Six Sigma,"This book was well worth my time and money! Being a Six Sigma beginer, I found this book to be easy to follow and comprehend.Explained is the DMAIC process model, Voice of Customer (VOC), Voice of Process (VOP)and Design of Experements (DOE) in clarifying detail. Best of all, it includes step-by-step explanations of project experiments and the statistical analyses from the expereiments using Minitab 14!Whether you want to learn the basics of the Six Sigma process (Chapters 1-8) and / or basic Six Sigma statistical tools and methods (Chapters 9-15), I highly recommend this book!Note: Minitab 14 (Statistical software)is free for 30 days and the associated minitab-formatted excercise worksheets are down-loadable from the publisher's website."
2,Blackbelt level book,"This book in my opinion is not written at a green belt level. The opening 12 pages get into Taguchi functions which is very advanced. Book seems to be written for people getting a specific certification which is a University of Miami certification, however if you are looking for a more universal text that is more accessible Warren Brussee has two texts that seem to be much easier for students to understand.You need to understand your audience. If you have high level high functioning potenitlal black belt individuals then this text may apply, but if you have people that are not in that category, I would recommend Warren Brussee's texts much more."
4,"Wicked sharp, but not so safe","I'm a little confused as to why these are labeled ""children's safety scissors."" Not sure what is so safe about them. They have a (very) pointy end, so I would never, ever give these to a child.They are extremely sharp, though, and a medium size, so they are great scissors for home (adult) use!I wanted something safe to carry in my diaper bag for quickly cutting up food (noodles, pancakes) for the toddler while eating out. These fit the bill, but I think I am still going to search for a pair that is A: smaller, and B: not a stabbing hazard/weapon."
2,Poor performance,"I bought this book for Deirdre Martin's short story and was sorely disappointed. The characters were completely unsympathetic, the additional side story line was ridiculous and the believability factor was stretched waaay too thin. Plus I have to say the hero and heroine were boring and without chemistry. Julia London's story was quite good. But I will not buy another Deirdre Martin book- after this and her last offering of ""Penalty Box"" I'm convinced that her frist three outings were her best. Too bad, because I really enjoyed them!The other two stories in the collection were so unmemorable I can't even offer comments....I've forgotten them."
1,Save your money,"This is without a doubt the lamest collection of short stories I have ever purchased. The characters are simpleminded and shallow and the plot lines are embarrassingly unbelievable. The secret children's hospital cars attached to the baseball party train in ""You Can't Steal First"" had me heading for the waste basket to either toss the book or throw up, whichever came first. I bought this book because I like Deirdre Martin's other books very much, but I was even disappointed in her storyline. Save your $10.99 for a more worthy project."
1,Dont waste your time,"It was great when I first got it. I had lost the magnetic bit holder that came with the B&D set I had. Fortunately, I found it again. Because this holder trapped a bit and would not release it. I could not get it out. Period. The metal tab along the top inside edge of the holder trapped several bits but I had always managed to get them out. Not this time. I put it in a bench vice and used every handtool known to man and it would not budge. Pass on it. Find another one. B&D even. There are no tabs to trap bits in theirs (truly magnetic and not compression)."
2,Kind of Dull,"Sort of a take off on 'Kitchen Confidential', i.e. ""I'm a wild and crazy guy and look at all the stuff I've done and gee I let my parents down but they still love me and none of the doctors would help me until finally one does and I've really been through alot and now I'm recovering, etc. etc."". I'm sure Mr. Behrman did have some bizarre experiences and has been ill but you know it is just not all that interesting. I do wish him well though."
2,Im still confused!!,"As someone that does not suffer from BiPolar Disorder, I was hoping to gain some insight into the mind of someone that suffers from this illness. I never felt that from this book, I could not understand how his compulsive actions actually stemmed from his illness. He seemed to me to be suffering from a huge case of narcissism."
1,Who cares?,"This is just another ""Please pay attention to me"" screed by a whiny New York loser. It teaches us nothing about the mind and how it works. In today's world, are we supposed to care about a vulgar, wasted life? I'm so tired of these ""memoirs"" begging us to sit in on everyone's therapy sessions. Go volunteer. Help someone. Think about someone besides yourself. Random House should be ashamed."
1,what a loser,"man, this book really annoyed me. I didn't even finish reading the thing. first of all, it's a TOTALLY original idea -a memoir about a manic depressive dude who gets electroshock to cure himself, right? So you'd think it would be a really cool, interesting read. But no way. This thing is a big yellow dud. Behrman is a total spaz who can't even take his own writing seriously. it's like one big sham. all we get here is stuff about his shopping and his freaky sex life and his drugging it up: this stuff is the price of entry into the catagory -but that's all we get here, nothing more. I felt totally ripped off. what a total loser."
1,Painfully unreadable,"Obviously the '80s were a nightmare for Behrman, but Electroboy was a nightmare to try to read in the '00s. It's less a memoir and more a 277 page run-on sentence. There's an overriding sense that Behrman is bragging about his exploits, since the details are accompanied by less than zero self-awareness. All memoir is self-involved, but this guy takes it to new depths. He's outdone Elizabeth Wurtzel -- and that takes some doing."
4,"Fascinating Story, Good Read","I have no idea what those other people read when they picked up their copy of Electro Boy by Andy Behrman......but I found an engaging, at times frenetic, compelling, poignant story of honesty, pain, exploration, poor choices, great humor, and ultimately some redemption. Behrman writes this as only someone who has ridden the roller coaster of mood disorder can do. And ridden it hard I might mention.Recently, I met Mr. Behrman, and never having read his work, decided this was the right time. He reinvented himself so many times in this story, while catastrophically suffering from mental illness - it defies description. I don't want to give away any plot points so I'll just say for those of you interested in this subject matter this is a must-have addition to your library. Bravo Andy & stay well!"
1,I wanted this book to be good,"I thought and hoped that this book would break away from some of the memoirs. The more that I read I found that I didn't like this guy so I wasn't really interested in what his life was like. I thought that I would read about a person that I could root for and/or learn from. This was not that book. Perhaps he should do like one of the other reviewers noted. Maybe he should volunteer somewhere for a very long time. Maybe then after some reflection and well placed focus on the needs and plights of others, he can come back and write a revised edition of this ""memoir""."
2,A Repulsive Individual,"This autobiography of a male prostitute, cocaine addict, and art forger I found sickening. There is nothing to like about this creep. The author is a manic depressive, and so am I, but I find no kinship with him. I'm even guilty of a few of the things he did, but at least I don't brag about my self-destructive exploits or try to entertain voyeurs with sleazy trash like Electroboy. I have a sense of shame, which Behrman obviously does not. I couldn't finish the book, which is rare for me; it's that disgusting."
1,Electro Boy: A memoir of Mania,I can't give any opinion as the order is already two weeks past its delivery date and I still have not received it. It is an impossibility to trace this on your system. As such I am extremely dissapointed.Deon
3,"Well, it wasn't a great read...","I've almost finished reading Electroboy (am on the 231st page). I think it's kind of a boring book. I don't feel like I learned a whole lot from it except that Andy Behrman is constantly moving, constantly doing something. He feels like he needs to do that. I feel sorry for him though; anyone who feels suicidal and miserable definitely holds my sympathy. I didn't really like the book a whole lot though..and I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Can be enjoyed from either an insider's or outsider's view,"I enjoyed this book from an outsider's point of view (I don't have BP) and I felt like it was a tremendously revealing look into the mind of a manic-depressive. Probably the life Jack Kerouac would have led, had he been young in the 1990's and been born into a well off family. The author teeters on the brink of self destruction throughout most of the book but always seems to eek it out, along the lines of Catch Me if You Can. If you have no sympathy for the burden of mental illness, then this is definitely not the book for you but if you'd like incite into this world, you'll love it."
4,A fascinating book,"I've read the twelve reviews posted here so far and find it interesting that people either love the book or hate it - not much middle ground. I suppose this is a reaction to the author's forthright self-presentation, which appeals to some and turns others off. I vote with the first group - it seems to me an honest book, deeply felt (if not deeply thought), and very vivid in its depiction of a chaotic psyche. In the end there is, inevitably, a voyeuristic fascination on the part of the reader (meeting Behrman's exhibitionistic style more than halfway) but how can one not feel compassion in the face of such suffering?"
5,Manic Explosion,"Sometimes, being a therapist, you forget what real true mania looks like because you don't get to see it too often. Granted, you see some hypomania, but you don't see the graphicness of true mania: $20,000 Barney's shopping sprees, prostitution, 3 a.m. random travel to wherever, or lying, cheating, and stealing without fear of getting caught. Reading this book was like watching a horrible TV special on fast-forward (horrible because it made you feel uncomfortable for Behrman and also for the people he knew, not because it was written poorly). I read paragraphs out loud to other therapists and they told me to stop because they couldn't follow what he was talking about. I sat and shook my head, thinking, ""You did WHAT?"" I definitely suggest this book to anyone who is interested in knowing what a full-blown manic episode looks like and all the possible ways that the psychiatric community can deal with it"
5,"You absolutely must read ""Electroboy""","""Electroboy"" sustains that rare ""can't-put-it-down"" sensation throughout. Berhman's book, like McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes"" succeeds because it is frighteningly honest, yet ridiculously funny.Behrman's writing is so concise and clear you start to feel like you're spying in on his fascinating history. He leaves the big stuffy words to the big stuffy writers. But make no mistake, Behrman, like McCourt, is a master.I guarantee if you read two pages of this book you will not be able to stop."
3,Brett Easton Ellis never promised you a Rose Garden,"Reading the first 75% of ELECTROBOY was similar to reading Less Than Zero or Rules of Attraction because you have all these excesses of yuppie angst without much emotional background. I was disappointed with the book becuase the author seemed to take pains to gloss over the human aspect of his story (while reveling in the wilder antics) and then chose to end the book in a more sensitive ""my cross to bear"" perspective. The book would have been better and more consistent if it had more input from the people who were being affected by his outlandish behavior. Outside of writing a stack of letters to a judge (in a twist so dubious I had to remind myself I was not reading a novel), they hardly register at all."
1,not what i was expecting,"I just finished ""Electroboy: A Memoir of Mania"", an autobiography by Andy Behrman, and I was not all that impressed with it. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I find the book left me wanting more information regarding how Andy handled ECT, like what he felt, rather than the ins and outs of his involvement in the art world (including sexual escapades) and how he was able to organize ripping people off. Also, it was hard to follow the story, as the style of writing is fast and bounces around from place to place but doesn't really say anything so in a way it doesn't matter that its choppy because there isn't a real story just lots of bragging and shopping. What I was left with was that this person is a real self promoter. He was able to sell fake paintings, and was alsoable to get me to buy his book. If I were you, I'd wait until you can grabit from your local library. Just my .02 worth."
4,Noah's Ark,The kids in my Sunday School Class enjoying playing with it. The animals are great and I liked that it came with a storage box. Do wish the ark was bigger. The ark is very small and not all the animals can fit in it.
3,Not worth the price,"The animals were not that nice , look cheap and bigger than I thought. Was not worth the price."
4,"Awesome bride, groom and parent wedding book","What a great book not like those normal wedding planning books. The stories from other brides and responses that Jean & Corinne give truly made me realize things do happen to every bride and groom as they plan their wedding and I'm not alone. A must read for brides, grooms, mothers, fathers, the wedding party, and even former brides & grooms. I'm buying for all my friends who get engaged!"
1,A Disapointing history of comedy talents!,"Mr.Parrish and Mr.Leonard try to give us all a look into the talents and sucesses of the movies'great comics and clowns.But instead..they show us nothing more than inaccurate info and a negitive look into the works of L&H,A&C,The Three Stooges,The Ritz & Marx Brothers Etc.The info is inaccurate,incomplete and at times so negitive.That it does little to endear anyone to this book.Some of the photos are rare and does give this manuscript some interest.But a small collection of rare photos do not help enhance a falied film history.In All..""The Funsters!""is another forgetable book that does not help enhance the history of film comedy.Avoid this book at all cost! Kevin S.Butler."
2,Did not fit,"They were too big. The 8"" fit perfectly. I don't know why the smaller ones did not fit. They were about a centimeter to large. They would not fit even with pressure. I had to return the smaller ones."
4,They are going to extend the life of our stove.,"We ordered 3 of these, 2 6"" & 1 8""; I only gave 4 stars because we had to slightly modify the burner trays. When I went to Sears they told me they're all different and we'd have to special order. Not the case at all...if you have a basic 2 prong plug-in these should work just fine. They were also half the price of anywhere else we looked."
5,It works great!,It works better than my old one.It was simple to replace this one with the old one.It arrived in great shape and it got here fast.
3,Coil not level - poor quality control,"I purchased this as a replacement for one of the burners that wasn't properly heating. The replacement came, but the coil was not snapped into place to the comb (device that keeps the colis separated.I could NOT snap in place, so I use it on the back of the stove for large pots.Next time, I will purchase it from Home Depot so I can see it before I purchase the item."
3,Poor Fit for Drip Pans,The range elements do not fit the drip pans I ordered. The metal tab on the element holder opposite the power plug-ins does not snap-fit into the drip pan. As a consequence the range element does not fit tight or level.
2,Not really universal,"I had to return the product because unfortunately it did not fit my stove. Granted they were fine about the refund, but I still had to go to the manufacturer to get the fit I needed."
3,Size not listed in sale ad,"I don't find the size listed in this ad for this range heating element,is it 6"" or 8""? Cannot buy unless I know the size."
5,Works great,Works great and well made I got it to use in my RV because it folds up and stores out of the way.
5,Great video,I bought this for my 17 month old. He loves watching the trucks work. He usually loses interest about 25 minutes into it but that is a long time for a 17 month old. It is actually very educational and easy to watch for adults too.
2,John Deers,"Its not as good as Hard Hats productions. Lots of country music and not enough filming of the trucks and the sound of the trucks. For example kids video ""where the garabge goes"" is far better produced and straight to the point..trucks/sound/smashing. The talking in the John deers video is far to much. Not enough concertration on the trucks at work."
2,ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha,compare this to latest amon tobin. i should give shadow one star. but im a nice guy.3 feet high and rising - came out in 88
5,"Critical, Active, Passive","Any way you choose to listen, this album provides incredible listening. Very expansive and spacious, yet intricate and detailed at the same time."
5,Remember When,"Do you remember what you were doing when Princess Diana died? When the towers were hit? What is it about this CD that many seem to remember where they were when they first heard it, or first bought it.I was walking home from class, along McCaul street in Toronto. I happened to wander into a record shop near Queen street, with a burn in my pocket. Not looking for anything in particular, I just wanted a new sound. Flipping through a variety of CDs, not knowing any of the artists, I flipped to DJ Shadow. At the time, this was the only CD he had released. The cover was bland at best, simply a photo of guys doing exactly what I was doing, flipping through records. I decided to buy it, and took it to the counter. Immediately the guy at the cash register mentioned that it I made a great pick, that DJ Shadow was amazing.Since then I have revisted Endtroducing many times, as well as DJ Shadows other releases. Its the type of CD you listen to for a while, put down, but then always return to."
5,Groundbreaking,"When Endtroducing came out, there was little if anything like it anywhere. It's hard to recapture that same feeling more than 10 years after the fact, but in my mind, this remains one of the top 50 innovative albums in music. Simply incredible turntablism."
5,Take this to a desert island!,"This album is absolutely unbelievable, unlike anything you would have ever heard up until the time it was released. I rank this right up there with Pink Floyd's ""Dark side of the moon"". If anyone ever tells you that sampling is thievery and unoriginal obviously they have never heard this CD. I am a musician/songwriter who incorporates a sampler into my work like DJ Shadow does and I can tell you he plays his instrument like Hendrix played the guitar, that is no exageration at all! As far as the songs go, they comprise a beautiful album that will transport you to another reality if listened to on headphones with your eyes closed."
5,Music with the power to move,"Endtroducing is a sublime record, sweeping loops and huge breaks, with an altogether new approach to hip hop. It goes from from truly original dance floor anthems (Organ donor, Number song) to tracks which go beyond the mellow and move into the disturbing, listening to this album walking home on a rainy night is a awesome, if scary experience."
5,SIMPLY AMAZING! A WHITE BOY WHO CAN GROOVE!,"One hell of a great CD from a very talented master of the turntables. Using withered vocals, haunting samples and luscious piano and bass, DJ Shadow supplies tight grooves that are perfect for your next party or just passing time..a classic."
5,Beautiful,"Undescribable, super-cool. Old vinyl, a cakeful of layers. Awesome- makes hip-hop as we know it look like some dead fish somewhere. This is the stuff that goes down. Buy this!"
3,"creative, but mild","I can see how many turntablist fans may find this CD very well done. But if you're looking for a head-nodder, Beat Junkies/X-men type album, this ain't it. Instead this album had more subdued beats over more laid back tracks. Don't get me wrong; DJ Shadow's music is artistic. But if you're looking for raw, rugged cuts, look elsewhere"
3,...not reinventing the wheel,"Shadow falls victim of his own hype..I've read so many good things about this album that it would have been impossible for it to live up to mine, or anyone else's expectations. What I see is someone taking the best of what's already available, and creating a mixture of different styles, which is an achievement in itself..but def. not covering much new ground here. His mastery of the beats is commendable, but Paul's Boutique is more interesting and was made about a decade earlier. His flair for epic-like songs comes off as slow, and you wonder where he's going w/his songs, while his contemporaries in electronic music can achieve this desired effect much more efficiently..thus not dragging us along (ironically, he samples the heck out of Bjork on one song, who's doing a much more entertaining job portraying soundscapes similar in makeup). Still a good buy..but don't expect it to change your life."
3,really kind of boring,"a california college town kid represents his version of instromental hip hop tracks. the beats are chunky. but he has a conservative take on music and styles compared to nyc and uk. i would rather listen to goofy tacky no limmit southern hip hop beats than bland tasteful preppy beats. i guess dont respect shadow as a master at his art, yet. he needs to work harder to impress me. also, live he's just as good as any hip hop dj you would hear at a bar. he plays records. thats it. save yourself some money."
2,A dissenting voice,"I hate to strike a discordant note, but I just don't get all the excitement. If I compare this guy to other DJs (notably Kruder & Dorfmeister), the music just doesn't hold up. Its less imaginative and the grooves just don't compare. And as far as drums & bass go, even comparative dabblers in the genre like Aphex Twin have produced far more compelling music. I'd heard all the raves about DJ Shadow and now have bought two of his CDs, including this one; I won't buy another. Its not that he's bad, he isn't. He's just not good enuf to make the cut."
2,Endtroducing,"I wish that I could have sampled this selection prior to it's purchase. There may be some entries that might be good for sampling, but I got no goosebumps listening to it. DJ Shadow has some wonderfully creative grooves out there.....just not on this disc."
2,No reason to buy this version,"I love the original release of Endtroducing and was super excited to hear about this two disc set. Man what a waste of money! There is nothing special at all about this version, unless you consider the exact same mix minus a couple talking samples here and there ""special."" Seriously, that's about it.In the liner notes, Shadow even says that due to the way he recorded the original there aren't any versions that exist with the tracks separated. You desperately need these separated tracks in order to do anything new and interesting with the remix. By his own admission, these are just some old backups of the almost finished songs. There are also a few half assed remixes, including one of the worst drum and bass remixes I've ever heard. What a wasted opportunity.The guy's had 10 years to come up with something special and instead he decides to rip off his loyal fans. Trust me, stick to the original one disc version of Endtroducing."
4,good but old,I got this cd recently but I think it has aged a lot. Even though it is good I think his new cd is a lot better and it has all new stuff.
5,Dis Phat...,"Beauty beyond the meaning of the word. This is music for and by the human soul. Insight from Dj Shadow conveyed through his pure will and sampler. He should some kind of award for ""Best Song Title that actually Fits the Song"", Midnight in a Perfect World, is the best description of just that...Before DJ Shadow, I had absolutely no interest in hip-hop or rap(not that I'm labeling this as Hip-hop), but after, I actually had faith that it might possibly be good music...Josh Davis, someday I would like to meet you, and have a nice, long conversation..."
5,One of the reasons its good to be alive,"I'm not going to do a play by play analysis of why this album is great, I will say this, that it is one of the greatest peices of music ever recorded. No album has been able to evoke such emotion in the listener ( me in this case ) than Entroducing, including vocal works. It is consistent in theme and emotion through the whole album. I had the pleasure of seeing Shadow live in Toronto a month ago and it was amazing, I've never felt anything like it, there was electricity in the air, it was probably the closest thing I've had to a religious experience in my life. Do yourself a favor and get this album."
5,Very thought inducing,"Wow I bought this about two years ago and I still listen to it. It is a bit depressing and somber but it's good to listen to when doing something mentally intense, like programmming a computer. It makes you think about life too, one of my favorite Cd's ever. Just really different from any other hip hop I have ever heard."
3,Good Food!,"Especially for picky avians. Although it's probably the most expensive and least available product to fin in PetsMart, Petco (the 5lb) I still give in and hunt it down, promising myself I would order from Amazon.Shipping is extremely out of line in cost, expecially the standard. Great way to pump up your bottom Lafeber."
4,My 6 Cockatiels,"My cockatiels would eat this but prefer Kaytee Exact, the other product I feed them. I noticed that my cockatiels wouldn't eat the powder left over from the Lefebers when they broke it all apart. This is opposite of what they do with Kaytees exact, they love that stuff. Although, I would recommend this stuff over seeds."
3,Best for Beginners.,This is definitely not one of the Firm's better workouts. Allie has a great on-camera personality but I've always found the workouts she leads to be too easy and the workouts on this DVD are no exception. I would recommend this workout for beginners rather than intermediate or advanced exercisers.
5,Great Quick Workout,"The Firm has long provided great workout videos. The TIME CRUNCH CARDIO workout is a great workout for those who don't have 30 minutes to an hour to get their workout in for the day. In 20 minutes, you can get a great sweat going and raise your heart rate! There are three 20 minutes workouts on this video and they're all fun!"
1,Very disappointing.,I have been a long time Firm person but found this DVD and the 3 workouts to be disappointing. They provided no challenge and I barely broke a sweat or even had a remotely elevated heart rate.
5,Best non-seminar review book for the ARDMS RVT exam!,"I feel like this book covers all the information necessary to pass the ARDMS RVT specialty exam. It is very thorough, and well written. If you don't have several hundred dollars to go to a review seminar, and even if you do, this book is a great asset."
5,Excellent for preparation for the RVT Technology exam.,"As an instructor in Ultrasound physics I find this book a very concise compilation of all the areas tested by the ARDMS. I am using this text in our accredited ultrasound program. It is hard to find one textbook that covers all the fundamentals in an easily read and studied format.Ellison Marshall, BSRT, RDMS, almost RVT"
1,Defective Item,I bought the Viewsat VS2000 Ultra Free-to-Air Satellite Receiver from Amazon and when I was trying to use it did not work and when protesting to Amazon they told me that it is to HottechDeals that I had to protest against but they don't respond to the emails I sent them. I was told to return the item by mail. So I returned by mail the equipment and I was hoping that they would return my money or that would send me an equipment that works well. But they haven't done any of the two.
2,MWD-1450 lacks phonetic symbols,"According to Webster's definition, a dictionary should at leastcontain information about a word's definition, etymology, andpronounciation. I'm very disappointed that the MWD-1450 lacks thepronounciation key which will be very helpful to the user to learnthe correct pronounciation of the word of interest. I wish I couldbuy a ""speaking dictionary"" for my child instead."
3,Okay.,"The display is kinda lousy. But it really comes in handy at times but if you have trouble reading the display, then save your money and purchase a Palm PDA or Sony PDA with maybe a backlight function. I use both this device and my Palm Zire 21 for reading and reference. So, I prefer to use the Palm Zire 21 with the eReader Pro application installed with a reference title but the dictionaries on eReader.com aren't as easy to read because the font is too small. So, get this device if you just need an electronic book reader and portable reference device."
2,No pronunciation,"This electronic dictionary does not display pronunciation for the words that you look up. If learning the pronunciation is also important to you, you should stay away from this product."
3,Terrible Screen Display,The screen display is terrible. Couldn't really see anything.You really have to tilt to certain direction in order to viewthe definition.It needs real imporvement on the contrast. Everything else is fine.
5,An extremely helpful book,"Philip Andrews has written a lot of books for the users of Photoshop and they are by all means ""well explained&illustrated;"".As no other he knows what ""teaching"" is and his latest Adobe Ph Elements 4 A to Z confirms my opinion.You 'll find everything about the software in an alphabetical order with a lot of examples in this book.It's a continuous reminder when you hesitate about some features working on some photographs or compositions.His style is clear,efficient and above all practical.Even for owners of other tutorial books or intermediate users this book is very useful;a good investment if you want to improve your skills.It can be used by owners of previous versions of the software too.Buy it and you won't regret it!!"
5,Rags to Riches: The Essential Hits of Scott Joplin,"I ordered this CD to use as a source for a graduate school paper I was writing, but I ended up keeping the CD as I really enjoy Scott Joplin's music. Thanks to Amazon I was able to use this purchase for school and for pleasure."
3,NOT true to size,Way to big for my small dog. The vest itself was really well made and I do like it. Had to return it because it didn';t fit my dog.I returned the harness back to Amazon and they credited me the full amount paid. THEYpaid for my postage. I will definitely order from them again. I gave it a 3 star only bcuse it's NOT tru to size.
4,Works Great,"Needs gray or black trim. I used a black marker, after it dried it was a grey, made the vest look much better.Needs a little work on the sizing guide, runs a little bigger then marked."
1,CHANEY ALARM CLOCK,"this item is junk ,it will work for a week or so and after that your on your own ,the wind up knobs dont wind there hard to turn at best The alarm is very short beacuse of a week spring ,it looks nice thats it"
1,A Mother Wrote This Book?,"I know that there have been many things said about the gay characters in this book. I don't have a problem with gay characters per se, but I do have a real problem with any character saying that he or she doesn't have a mom but has two dads. It's hard for me to believe that a mother would write something such as this, something that so devalues motherhood. We all have a mother and a father, even if we are separated from them via adoption or death. To teach a child that he or she has no mother is a terrible thing to do. Why must Freeman encourage the myth that once a child is adopted, he or she loses his or her natural parents? How very sad. I won't be buying this book for any friends."
3,Who? times two,"This ALPHA VIDEO double feature consists of 'B' grade ""whodunit"" programmers from Hollywood's golden age of limburger.SYNOPSES--THE HAT BOX MYSTERY-- A private eye's Girl Friday is given a camera hidden in a hatbox so she can secretly snap a woman's picture.

1,regulator worked but in reverse up is down and down is up,"The window regulator operated in reverse (wires were reversed in manufacturing). The seller gave me the choice of either exchange or refund $20 and I could swap wires myself. I chose the latter but never received my $20 refund. Very disappointed as I asked three times. Item works, but the auto down where the window goes down by tapping is now auto up which could be a safety hazard."
1,victor guzman,I am very disapointed in the service I have recived and your A-Z return policy is a BIG jokehave been trying to get a return taken care of and have not even recived a call back. I am thinking about calling the BBB on you and your so call A-Z policy.Victor Guzman
1,Poor quality product,"My mom has an Olds Alero and I have replaced the window regulators 4 times on different doors. I'm not sure if its the parts suppliers fault or if its General Motors terrible design. I heard Aleros were lemons anyways. The cable always comes off the plastic wheels and gets wrapped and knotted up. I usually don't give bad ratings but after buying 4 of these things and then having them break not even a month later, I just welded a rod inside the door so the window never rolls down again."
1,Where'd My Part Go ?,Ordered this over 14 months ago from Best Price Mirrors the sent me a regulator for a 95 Honda regulator. Called Best Price Mirror Said the would send correct regulator guess the sent it to wrong address. emailed Amazon. No Response from them either. After waiting for a year I ordered another regulator sold and shipped by Amazon and received correct part on time.
2,"weak magnet, bit-locking mechanism failure after 1 month","the magnet is BARELY strong enough to hold a small screw horizontal. the whole idea of this tool is to free up your other hand...that the magnet can hold onto the screw. i'm pretty disappointed in this tool. also, the bit-lock sleeve no longer locks onto the bit. this tool seemed simple enough, but i must say dewalt failed me with this one."
5,Good.,Can't complain about this. Worked good for 2 days. Then I snapped a cold bit off in it and couldn't get it out and had to toss it in the trash. Will buy again though. Snapping had nothing to do with this post.
4,Central California Area movie,"A good movie for people who grew up in that era or who live in the Central California/Bay Area. Scenes from San Francisco and Monterey Bay area may bring back memories. If you like the music from that era, when musicals were more popular, you will also enjoy."
5,Spring in a bar of soap,I love the scent of these soaps. So much better than lavender. I wish I had bought them for myself. Maybe in Jan.
2,Waste of money-innacurate,"The ""wired probe"" must be put outside but isn't waterproof.There is a 5 degree margin of error,and it isn't wireless.Waste of money!"
2,review of timer,Works fine. I have two of them monitoring temperature in a cabin. One on each end of the cabin. Both reading very consistantly the same.
3,Inside/outside Thermometer,Seems to work well although I mistakenly ordered the wired instead of the wireless. Not sure that it was clear in the ad.
4,Nice thermometer,"The thermometer was easy to install, and accurate and convenient. I had purchased a less expensive thermometer, only to find when I had slugged my way through the packaging that it should not get wet. This was a OUTDOOR thermometer!!I returned it to the store and ordered this through Amazon. I am very satisfied with the instrument."
1,Disappointed,"I had an old LL Bean Indoor Outdoor thermometer that was acting up as I think it got moisture in it so I bought this thermometer as a replacement. While the price was right, I'll probably be returning it. When I installed it, the wire broke while tacking it to the outside wall. So I reconnected the wire. It may have been my fault but the wire was quite flimsy. Once reattached, the outside temp came up and all seemed well. Sadly after a few days, maybe due to my connection or maybe not, the outside temp became obviously off by about 10 degrees. Oddly enough, my old LL Bean which is wireless started working. Personally would recommend a wireless unit. Wires are very limiting and are vulnerable."
3,Hidden truth : Not Accurate (noted in the manual),"Can't anyboody read the manual or test the out/in temparature!!It's manual stated that the accuracy of this unit 6 degree max. Your device may show 81 F while it is realy 75 F. This information is not available through the description or the specs of the unit. It is written in the manual.In addition to this one, if you keep the unit and the out side probe in the same room close to each other there is at least 1 degree diference. If you can wait long enough (couple of hours) it can come close with 0.4 degree difference. If you move the device (or just walk by), the outside measurement jumps high immediately becuse of the wind you created. (I also purchase one from Target and test both at the same time and as expected both are showing the different values.)Read the manual before purchase it. so there will be no disappointment."
1,"Out of the box, did not work","I spent half hour (not counting opening the package it was packed it) trying to get the time set. No luck. Could not reset according to instructions, or indeed, at all. From other reviews, sounds like some of these work great; others, not at all. Unfortunately, I got one of the lemons. Easy return per Amazon. Hope that works."
1,disappointing,"The inside and outside temperatures were significantly different, despite measuring the same room's temperature. Was not able to set time despite carefully following instructions."
1,Completely worthless,"I bought this for one thing, to tell me when it's sub freezing outside. Currently my thermometer says 36 degrees, yet everything outside is frozen so it's at most 32 degrees. Local weather states it's currently 28 degrees, which feels accurate to me outside. I thought maybe it was too close to the window and picking up heat from that, so I moved it far away from the wall and window. No change at all. This thing is complete junk, I was fooled by the reviews."
1,Temp is not accurate,"I bought this for my camper because I thought it would be extremely accurate being a wired unite. After installing this unit, which meant drilling a hole in my campers siding, cabinets and mounting in on a cabinet surface I sat back to admire my work. After twenty minutes I noticed that the outside temperature was reading 98 degrees. This seemed strange because the day's high was only supposed to be 85! The probe is installed correctly (shaded from direct sunlight). This unit is useless to me since it's only job is to tell me the temperature and it doesn't do that. I will be trying another and trashing this one!"
3,not accurate,"This thermometer is accurate within 3 degrees indoors 5 degrees outdoors, it will be even less accurate if placed near a window. At least this has been my experience, my sisters thermometer is more accurate and is a mercury one, both indoors and outdoors."
5,Oregon Scientific THT312 Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer Clock with Wired Probe,"Oregon Scientific THT312 Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer Clock with Wired ProbeI love this thing. I used to have one of the weather stations with the wireless piece that goes outside, but the weather and elements would destroy them way to often. So i decided to just get this one, and place it on my bedside table, so I get to see the temperature in my bedroom, and pass the cable through the window. It works out just great, as it lets me know when its cool enough outside to open up the window."
2,"Nice, but it eats batteries","I love having the information of time and in/out temp right in plain view, and this piece displays well. However, I have replaced the batteries (new energizer batteries) twice in 1 week. Due to this shortcoming, I would not recommend this product."
1,Oregon Scientific THT312 Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer Clock with Wired Probe,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. I am very disappointed because the temperature of this product is not accurate. We first hung it on the wall beside another thermometer and the temperature varied by 5 degrees. We now have it hanging on the wall and the indoor/outdoor temperature are not the same although they are in the same spot. We have tried hanging it outside and again the indoor/outdoor temperatures are not the same although they are in the same place.
1,No Quality Control,This item was purchased 3 months ago and one of the control switches has failed. This is the second Oregon Scientific device we have purchased and both failed within one year. Look some where else...
5,Liked it so much I just bought a second one,"Have one monitoring freezer in garage. The new one is being used to monitor temperatures in a media cabinet as I adjust fans. Very visible display, and having both ambient and sensor temps at the same time at a large display size is great."
2,Not worth the price,"I got this hoping to have a nice little unit for my bedroom so I could tell the outdoor temperature in the morning. However, upon receiving it and installing the batteries the outdoor thermometer has never worked. I emailed Oregon Scientific and they said it was defective and to send it back. For the $10 or whatever I paid for it, I can't be bothered. I ended up just sitting it in the windowsill."
2,"Very Tiny-- I thought it was at least 5"" X 8""",Length:: 3:36 MinsIt does what it is supposed to and pretty accurate at that. The back light is very weak and its definitely not blue. See Video
3,Disappointed,"This item could be very useful. It has a clock, alarm, and two temperature guages! Unfortunately the seller sent me a used, nonworking item and is not returning messages. I would recommend this product, just not from ""FogDog""."
2,Disappointed.,"Probably a perfectly good product but I did not realize that I would have to have a hole drilled through my house wall to utilize it.I am a somewhat disabled senior and waited for my son's advice & help. He did not want to drill the hole through a very thick wall. It was then just too late to return the item, hence it will probably get donated to charity."
1,Inaccurate thermometer,There is always a difference of 3 Grad Celsius in relation to the official weather report.No support. Don't buy anything from Oregon!
5,"Does the job, and for a very low price","The thermometer i've had in my kitchen has been running for over 10 years. Finally the cats chewed off the sensor and we lost our outdoor temperature.I have a number of devices using the wireless transmitters, but I just want something simple that gives me the indoor and outdoor temperature, and with a window nearby I attempted to find a replacement unit.The Oregon Scientific unit has more features than I needed, but it was inexpensive and had a wired probe, so I ordered it.Installation took minutes, and it works just fine. What more can I expect?Hopefully it will last the next decade...."
4,Does a great job for the price,We've had this for over 6 months and its still kicking. Great quality for the price and nice big numbers you can see from halfway across the room as long as there's light.
2,Did not work properly!,"I returned the thermometer, because the temperature readings were not accurate.As usual, Amazon was GREAT! Sent a return authorization, and promptly processed a full refund!I bought a similar thermometer at Home Depot, for slightly less money, but I am not particularly impressed with it either.I do not expect the thing to last!These cheap Chinese made thermometers are really little more than Chinese junk!"
4,A great little product,It came prompt as I expected keeps good time and is pretty good on letting me know the right temp on the outside of my patio
5,A good product,"I have two of these. They bear up well, are accurate and I don't have to worry about ""wireless"" nonsense with batteries and where to position the transmitter device."
2,hard to read,This thermometer is hard to read when mounted to a wall. i bought it to replace em899 which had a much larger display with much thicker and darker numbers. After years of use the display died.
5,Know what it is like before you go outside!,"Ever get up in the morning and not realize what to wear? With this dual thermometer you can decide while you brush your teeth, get out of bed or are reading the morning newspaper. No need to step outside, just look at the reading and go from there."
2,Not happy,"I am not happy with this thermometer. I gave it 2 stars because I would really like the unit- if it worked. WHEN it actually works it reads an accurate temperature (I verified it against weather.com), and is easy to read out my front window. Unfortunately, it only works about 50% of the time. At first I thought it just used up batteries rather quickly, which was annoying- but I could have lived with that. However, I have noticed that even when I put brand new batteries in, it still only works about half the time.Overall I am not satisfied with this product."
2,Returned - got money back,"The outside temperature worked for a brief time, then stopped working all together. Replacing the batteries did nothing. It was also pretty cheesy. The seller was great and I was able to promptly return the item."
3,A Little Uneven,"I have to say I agree somewhat with an earlier reviewer who stated that it is far-fetched to think that this woman (Chris, the heroine of the story) would be allowed constant access to the murder victim's family, asking them all manner of personal questions, when she is neither a cop nor a detective. I also find it far-fetched that her policeman husband would encourage her to go and talk to murder suspects, most often alone, but also taking her 3-year-old son along for the ride. What mom would put herself or her son in danger like that? The one thing I have to say I did like about this book is that, unlike certain other Lee Harris novels whose titles I will not mention at the risk of spoiling anything for other readers, is that at least the murderer was not first introduced to the readers on page 248 of a 250-page book!"
1,Garbage,"If I had three arms, maybe four, this would have been easy to put up. As I have only two, it was a nightmare. Each section warps as the screws are tightened, so getting each subsequent section level and nested neatly inside the previously mounted section is very difficult.On second thought, even if I had more arms than a Hindu deity, I would still dislike this product. The inside of the channel has ledges in it to hold the screws in place. These ledges catch on cables which the user adds or removes after the unit is mounted. I gave up on trying to remove an RCA cable from the unit and just cut the darned thing, rather than trying to feed it through the channel.I wish I could recommend a better wall-mounted cable management unit. If I find one, I'll amend this review to include it.Save your money; buy something else."
3,Somehow useful but the tittle is misleading,"I expected to read about several successful Business Models but instead the author presents us a methodology to evaluate if a business concept is successful or not.The theoretical basis for Business Models is also missing, even the Business Model concept is missing.I bought a book that was under my expectations. This is the risk of buying online, you don't have the chance to open the book and have a general idea about the contents."
4,Helpful for clueless,"It is worth the price if you are really clueless and need a guide to taking care of the house. I have always wanted to stay home with my kids and have always had visions of a happy clean home, and then reality hits and it is not that easy. [...]"
3,A good start,"Down on the Farm is a horror novel from the late 80's that really grabs your attention at the beginning with a malevolent creature from outer space which buries itself in the ground in the early part of the 19th century. The story moves to present day where an old barn now covers the burial site and the creature is beginning to awaken. The story holds promise early as the creature is able to affect the minds of those people near it but soon the story tends to get muddled and a little hard to follow. The ending is also a little abrupt. It's as if the author simply chose to end the story rather than carry it out to a logical conclusion. It's not really a common book, however, I can't recommend going out of your way to find it either."
3,Great songs.....,"but what happened to recording with banda sinaloense?? He recorded with banda a lot in his earlier years, and I would have liked at least some of these songs to have been with banda. But oh well, I just hope he doesn't forget that he sounds really good with banda too, and not just pander to the commercial, and more conventional, masses that prefer the mariachi style."
3,Narrow Focus,"Interesting, but the focus on the organization is missing. We should not confuse management development with organization development (or vice versa)."
4,Good book - very succinct,"I liked the book. It outlines at a high level 3 key things you should do when implementing or managing a change initiative. It does not, nor is it intended to, discuss how to navigate the increasingly complex and speedy ""change"" that comes at us everyday. The authors repeatedly stated that managing change is more complex than what's described in the book. Their goal was to focus on the top 20% of the things you should do to manage 80% of the change, which they accomplish. Don't forget though that when it comes to managing change, the devil is in the details!"
2,Very basic,It's useful for beginners and those who simply want to gain a general idea about the bible. A lot of color photos and paper quality is nice. But I must say it's mostly fluff and no substance.
2,Very Disappointing,"Pete Haycock and Steve Hunter are both fantastic blues rock guitarists, the former with Climax Blues Band and a great solo outing, Guitar and Son, and the latter as a sideman on many classic albums by Peter Gabriel, Lou Reed, Alice Cooper, and others, as well as a couple of solid solo efforts. I couldn't wait to hear them play together. I should have waited--this sucks. Glossy, uninspired, completely forgettable pop. What were they thinking?"
4,Great for learning Spanish,"Our son is 2 1/2 and we are teaching him Spanish. He loves this book and we play ¿Dónde Está? with him and we say the item, and he points to it in the book. It's a very cute book and we have a great time with it. There are sections to help you with standard vocabulary for the kitchen, the bedroom, the living room."
3,Wolf,The music on this CD is in the vein of traditional US metal. Overlapping guitars and vocals. The singer sounds just like the guy in 220 Volt from 20 years ago. Overall the musicians are talented and some of the songs do stand out such as the title song Evil Star. I do find that the songs tend to start sounding alike after a while and sometimes change to something else a little fresher. They are influenced by Iron Maiden and the guitarist is pretty good. You won't be disappointed if you sample their music before buying.
3,Very Easy True Stories:,"First 20 pages were completed in pencil, on arrival to me. Maybe a good workbook for ESL children and adults."
5,Durable and handy,This is a must have tool when working with screws that are deep inside of a computer case. It works great with my hitachi power screwdriver and is quite durable. I highly recommend it!
2,Less is more,"Avoid this set; instead, buy the wonderful ""Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio"". Everything on the Oscar Peterson disk is in this box set. Added to that are at least two disks of late-career material that is painful to listen to; it's incredible how badly he played in his last years. The last disk is mostly interviews which are awful. The questions are elementary and uninteresting (""When did you write 'Lester Leaps in'?""), and the replies are rambling, often incoherent. In the other material, there is certainly some nice stuff; even on the later cuts, Harry Edison almost saves the day with his beautiful playing. But in the end, spend [some money] for the Oscar Peterson disk, and you'll have all you need."
5,Excellent Movie! 5 Stars!!!!,"I don't speak Spanish very well but I have totally enjoyed the entire novela from the beginning to the end without subtitles and I have learned a lot of Spanish thanks to this wonderful show. The movie was the absolute icing on the cake as I could watch it with English subtitles. Jencarlos is a wonderful actor as well as the rest of the characters. The story is interesting and just like in the novela, Martin doesn't fail to be the wonderful jerk that I love to hate! The romantic scenes between Angel and Rene were hot although they DO NOT compare to the passion of Manuela and Angel. Topo and Gregorio's part was hilarious and funny. I give this movie 5 stars and I highly recommend it."
3,Its a good movie,"I saw the soap in spanish on Telemundo. For me was one of the greatest novelas of all times. The movie is acceptable, and it is not boring so i recommend it."
3,Sexy!!,"If you have seen the novela, then you will appreciate this movie. It explains what happened to Angel before the soap started. Very good, all the same characters."
4,Good movie,"I got this movie for my wife.. since she liked the soap opera so much. She really likes all the characters in that movie. I think it's worth it to buy this movie and add it to your collection, especially if you are a fan of the soap opera and want something to remember it."
1,Disappointed,"Very, Very Disappointed. Please do not buy this for you will be trap like I am. I love watching a story with a begining and the end. In the Begining alot of parts cut out and you are left with a big Question what happen I found only 1 DVD for 1 Hour 30 Mins and I am left in the middle of the story. I do not know what happen next."
2,Mas sabe el diablo- el primer golpe,IT IS SUPPOSED GABY ESPINO AND JEAN CARLO WERE TOGETHER.....I DON'T LIKE THE CHANGE.....
1,velma err worst three dollars ever spent,"I totally dug the music, but why'd they have to pretend they could sing? My neighbors cat sings better and it's dead."
1,If it walks like and talks like...,"Why only sold by ""used"" markets? Maybe because it's not an official release!!!Where is the song ""Money?"". It's on the LD and CD.When this DVD has an authorized release there will be much fanfare about it. Why buy over-priced unofficial releases and the band see none of the profits.Wait for the official release which should be soon now that PULSE is out of the way.Shame, shame, shame for trying to sell these unofficial releases. Wait for David Gilmour's stamp of approval."
5,Life is What You Make It.,"I purchased this book for my granddaughter and wound up reading it before I had the chance to present it to her.Jill Wolfson is a loving and caring author. She takes the young reader on a journey visiting problems that many youngsters are fortunate to have never known; she continues by getting into the emotions and thought processes of the protagonist, where they take her and how she works through them. ""What I Call Life"" is about a growing youngster; her experiences and relationships with others in a foster home, even though she still has a mother. All that with an ending that is pleasant for the reader.I can't wait for the opportunity to discuss this story with my 11 1/2 year old granddaughter to learn how she enjoyed it, what she got out of it and how the experiences made her feel"
5,Quirky and fun,"I loved this book. Jill Wolfson created a spunky, endearing character in Cal Lavender from the first words on the page. Readers will be drawn into the world (and personality) of this lively, teenage girl living in foster care. But Wolfson's quirky characters don't stop with Cal - short for California which in turn is short for Carolina Agnes London Indiana Florence Ohio Renee Naomi Ida Alabama - there are a whole host of fun, lovable characters to get to know, including the Knitting Lady who runs the girls group home. (Check out Wolfson's website, she loves knitting. Could she be the Knitting Lady?)No matter what the life situation of teenagers, they inevitable feel alienated from those around them. Wolfson's What I Call Life may be about a teen in foster care, but her voice expresses the needs all teens feel to fit in."
2,Need to pay extra for additional exercises,"Buyer beware. After paying for this book, the DVD-rom will prompt you to pay another US$30 for 80 additional exercises. That's a hidden expense which is not mentioned in the product description. This is wrong. I suppose for a book which is not intended for the beginner, the author assumes that you have the extra cash to spend on the additional exercises."
4,Good padfolio,"Purchased this Padfolio for taking a long on job interviews. Seems good enough for that, looks nice and has plenty of pockets for the paperwork you need to take with you. Definitely not top shelf by any means but good enough for my purpose."
4,"Recieved quickly, fine quality.","I was very pleased with this flag. I got it very quickly and it was in a brand new package. Theres a chunk of purple stripe on the hem of the red stripe, luckily its on the back and doesnt show when I hang it on the wall. If it were on the front, I would have sent it back without hesitation. I dont reccomend this product to be used as an outdoor flag, its more of an indoor decorative piece. Overall: Great product for the price, fast shipping, love it."
5,Vibrant colors,"Nice quality, bright colors. I don't know that this would hold up outdoors for a long period of time, but it's great to put up out by the pool for special occasions."
4,A pricey good book,"It is a good book for those who never learned how to say ""what do you want to do?"" in a natural way. This book shows you 20 and only 20 most common short forms. The content is well organized. But it is pricey for a book that has only 68 papges. For the most part, you may do a search and find them somewhere in the internet. But then again it is a good deal for those who do not care about the price."
2,Not really popular with our bird,"Our eclectus just snubbed his nose at this food. He would eat it when all else failed. I am sure the product was nutritious but it would do no good if he refused to eat it.I love the container,and the size.but I don't think we will buy this product again.they also make the nutri-berries and he LOVES them."
4,it's cool,"I like it. It is different. john woz has his own style that takes a little getting used to.He uses a lot of strange ways to describe things, but you can draw out analogies if you think about them. Of course most people shrug these off as just shallow lrics but there acually pretty good. I like this cd a lot. But i liked the first one too. If you didn't like the first one u probly won't like this one. But if your undicided pick up a copy. it's the best new thing out for a while. Warnig the cd isn't filled with saturday's and sex and candy clones. Almost the whole cd is pretty slow."
5,"Marcy Playground, Where have you gone?","When I first heard the song Sex and Candy I was an instant Marcy Playground fan. Then I bought their self-titled CD and loved them even more and I wondered why don't more people like this band. I felt like I was the only one listening to them. Then this CD came out and decided to buy it. At first it took a while to get used to the new style of music but then I grew to love this CD even more than the first. It even seemed liked those that loved Sex and Candy had forgotten who Marcy Playground was. Then this summer I forced one of my extroverted friends to listen to this CD . Now he loves them just as much as I do and luckily he talks about them all the time so hopefully I have earned THE GREATEST BAND ALIVE, MARCY PLAYGROUND just a few more fans. Amen."
3,In between the lines,"This album isnt great, but its not bad. it has some good songs on it but there is still a big level of immaturity in the song lyrics and thhe complexity of music. but I must say that Marcy Playground is a talented group of guys who try very hard and succeed on many levels already. when this band finishes growing up theyre gonna be something special. buy this album if you want the foundations of a band in progress."
3,Mostly Uninspired,"Following their delicious debut cd, John Wozniak and co. soared into parvenu status in the pop world, riding on their hit single Sex & Candy. Marcy Playground had a pretty good chance to increase their fan base and really blossom into one of the great alternative bands of the mid 90s. Sadly, this album is an average, retrograde cd that is certainly not as good as the band's debut. Some promising glimmers of light shine through on Wave Motion Gun and Pigeon Farm, but the album is clearly lacking in the ebullience and cohesiveness that abounded in the bands previous outing. True afficionados of MP's first cd might want to check this out for the few good tracks on here, but for anyone being introduced to Marcy Playground for the first time, check out their debut."
5,Amazing. These guys just know how to groove.,"I was lucky enough to be one of the attendees at the record release party in NY on November 2 at the Mercury Lounge. Everything they did was perfect and the guys in the band are fantastic. The coolest bunch of guys around. John Wozniak's father was there as well and he is just as amazing. This record may possibly be better than the self-titled release. Everyone should also get ""Zog Bogbean From The Marcy Playground."" That album rocks as well. This was their first release. Enjoy!"
2,Birdwing,"I love retellings of classic tales; I thought Birdwing had an extremely interesting premise. However, I found the construction of the plot to be rather shoddy. Too many twists were thrown in with no clues except cryptic hints by seers that don't impress any reader of the fantasy genre anymore.The characters were forgettable. The only character with much identifiable personality was Horse, who was rather endearing.The writing, for the most part, was mediocre. Ardwin's angst was described, but not particularly felt. He comes off as just another mixed up emo kid who wants everything but not willing to commit to anything.As another reviewer pointed out, this book is definitely NOT appropriate for 6-10 year olds, for sexual references and overall redability. They are small, but definitely not necessary for younger readers.All in all, I'm glad I didn't buy this book at full price. $.50 at a second hand store was a waste of money."
5,One eye,"I wasnt expecting that....it absolutely blew my mind. I took a gamble and bought the movie without at least renting it first, im glad i did"
1,WTF...,This movie seemed to have great potential. I sat waiting in anticipation for the entire length of the film. I was left sadly disappointed and distraught. Nothing ever happens in this movie. Ok something does happen...**SPOILER ALERT** everyone except the little boy dies. WTF.
1,Unforgettable . . . unfortunately.,"This movie is a complete waste of time. Fortunately I didn't pay to see it. It's nonsensical, boring, poorly written,and it's absolutely filled with long scenes of characters doing nothing more than staring at each other. If you took out all the silent stares, the movie would be 30 minutes long. It'd be like 300 if you bumped up all the slow motion bits to normal speed. I'd say the acting sucked, but how can you rate the acting when nobody in the movie acts? I like independent and quirky films, but this one is just plain bad."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THIS FILM, ESPECIALLY AFTER HEARING ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS FROM THE FILM FESTIVAL. IT WAS TRULY DISAPPOINTING. THE LEAD ACTOR ""MADS MIKKELSEN"" WANDERS THE COUNTRYSIDE LOOKING LOST AND OUT OF TOUCH THROUGHOUT 90% OF THE FILM. DOESNT SAY ONE WORD THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE FILM AND IF SHOWING OFF HIS MANGLED EYE DESERVES HIM SOME KIND OF ACTING AWARD THAN SO BE IT. THATS ALL HE DOES. RELIGION AND REALITY THEME THROUGHOUT IS POORLY PORTRAYED. NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR $. THE MOVIE IS HORRIBLE. THANKS IFC FOR ANOTHER OVERRATED, HYPED PIECE OF FOREIGN TRASH."
1,Save your money,"I was surprised that this was such a flop.Is there any way that I can get my money back?If anyone really wants this DVD, I'll give you a good deal for the copy I bought."
1,VALHALLA SINKING,"SOULD BE TITLED ""VALHALLA SINKING"" TO A NEW LOW IN POINTLESS FILM-MAKING. APPARENTLY, THE DIRECTOR BELIEVES FILM NICETIES SUCH AS DIALOGUE, PLOT, AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT HAVE NO PLACE IN FILM MAKING ANY LONGER. PERHAPS TRUE WITH COMPUTER-GRAPHICS DRIVEN FILMS, BUT THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY COMPUTER-GRAPHICS EITHER. AFTER 20 MINUTES I BEGAN TO FAST FORWARD. AFTER 10 MINTUES OF FAST FORWARDING I BEGAN TO LOOK FOR A FASTER FAST FORWARD. POINTLESS, MONOTONOUS FILM. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."
3,Blood and thinking,"I purchased this based on a trailer and synopsis, which made it seem like a more gritty version of the 13th Warrior. It did not quite live up to my expectation. There is not a lot of dialogue in this to carry the story so much of the story line is left to the interpretation of the viewer. It starts out with the protagonist (?) fighting for the amusement of his warlord captors and quickly evolves. He escapes and then joins a band of Christian vikings on their way to fight in the Crusades, they become lost at sea and end up stranded on a unknown island. At this point the movie goes into strange territory. The individuals of the party become separated and go on different spirit journeys which leaves only a few surviving. Don't expect any catharsis to this film, you may have to watch it two or three times to come to any conclusion about the film maker's vision."
1,what did I just watch?,"this is the type of movie hipster college kids watch and think they're deep, and the movie is deep. Its poorly shot, making an over attempt at setting moods and scenes. With better quality equipment and better quality actors the subtlety might have actually worked. Instead at the end most of us just ended up saying ""huh?""."
2,Film good for scenery-bad for story line,This film was very disappointing. The acting was not good-the main character never spoke at all-just sinster looks. The violence level was high and if you figured it out the story-line was not that bad-not good either.
1,VALHALL SINKING,"SHOULD BE TITLED ""VALHALLA SINKING"" TO A NEW LOW IN POINTLESS FILM-MAKING. APPARENTLY, THE DIRECTOR BELIEVES FILM NICETIES SUCH AS DIALOGUE, PLOT, AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT HAVE NO PLACE IN FILM MAKING ANY LONGER. PERHAPS TRUE WITH SOME COMPUTER-GRAPHICS DRIVEN FILMS, BUT THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY COMPUTER-GRAPHICS EITHER. AFTER 20 MINUTES I BEGAN TO FAST FORWARD. AFTER 10 MINTUES OF FAST FORWARDING I BEGAN TO LOOK FOR A FASTER FAST-FORWARD. THE GOOD NEWS: IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY VAMPIRES IN IT. POINTLESS, MONOTONOUS FILM. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."
1,Sucks,"Don't waste your precious time. This flick is pretentious. It blows. Had some potential, but definitely missed the mark. The movie thinks it has something to say, and its medium is violence, but no."
1,"Disappointed, the description of the movie is misleading","I must say when i saw the description of the movie I thought of something completely different. This is more of the indi, IFC kind of film. Definitely meant to be more artsy that what i call ""real movies"". And personally i really don't like artsy movies at all."
1,Horrible.,"I was very excited for the movie. What a big downer. Nothing viking about it. No plot, poor acting, lousy screenplay, very, very boring. One of the worst movies I have watched in a long time."
1,Horrible movie,Ok so a guy with one eye walks around killing people and talks threw a kid. They play really bad annoying load music the whole time. The script was maybe two pages. Thats about how much dialogue they had. They one eyed guy just stood around staring at stuff like a mental case. Oh and they made Christians look like total nuts jobs thats seems to be a cool thing to do now days. Horrible waste of time.
1,very very disapointing,"I really like historical movies specially with some action. It was really a big challenge to finish this one. I think the entire dialog of the movie consited in less than two wriiten pages. Now, if you want something to help you sleep, then this is the one you need."
2,Plodding and directionless,"The movie lost me about halfway through, mostly because there was almost nothing to explain why they were doing anything they were doing. Perhaps I lacked context for it, but, outside of the fight scenes, there really wasn't anything going on that made any sense."
2,Valhalla Rising not as good as previews,"We saw the previews from watching another movie. We like action packed old time movies but this one was a big disappointment. The story line was weak ,the acting was mediocre and we wouldn't watch it again at any time.The best part of the whole movies was the little preview clip. The rest was boring."
1,"So slow, so boring, so incomprehensible.","The movie appears to have been filmed in a state park. Nice lake, nice shore, nice hills, but zero interest. If you really pay attention to the movie, I'm sure you can find themes regarding the hypocrisy of Christianity with salvation v. aggression, and maybe even the ills of slavery... but you have to try and find any redeeming value to the movie.Just because you put background music to someone walking... doesn't make it interesting.I will say that despite it being one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, it is not one of the worst."
2,It's Not Hollywood Garbage...It's Eurotrash,"Following a series of graphic fight sequences, Valhalla Rising sinks into one agonizing, relentless slog. The frame is often filled with wildly beautiful landscapes (which is why I gave it two stars) or actors, caked in blood and mud, placed artfully within the shot. However, a talented cast is wasted, spending far too much screen time grimly staring off into the distance or at each other. I generally like films that are thoughtful and contemplative but this one failed to engage me on any level. When you catch yourself wondering why the director chose a certain angle for a shot, you know it's time to remove the disc from the tray and get on with your life."
2,Not something I would recommend,I read some good reviews about this movie but I just didn't get it. I think the movie itself was well made and the acting was alright but it just never became clear to me what this was supposed to be about or if it was to stand for something.
4,Excellent...,A brooding and dark movie that may not be for everyone. A telling hint is this: the main character never speaks. It is in my favorites list.
4,Wow.,"Really all I can say is wow. This movie is very moving, shot beautifully, and the small amount of speech is perfect for the movie. I would recommend this to any one, and it's a beautiful movie.The only issues I take with the movie are its timeline. Many sites say the setting is in 1000 A.D. Scotland. The Christian Scottish ""Vikings"" (ignoring the fact that by the time of the First Crusade, 1096-1099, the entirety of the British Isles were Christian, not Heathen), are going to the Holy Land of Jerusalem, and make remarks of their fathers going there and returning to tell of its beauty. The First Crusade was 1096-1099, and the Second Crusade timeline was 1145-1149. But, it's a very small time issue with me, so the movie still receives 4 stars."
3,"Mezmerizing, boring, thrilling, puzzling, exciting, sleepy, the full gamet.","I wish I would have video taped myself watching this movie to see all the various facial expressions I was exhibiting while I was trying to process what in the heck was going on in this film. There is very little dialogue (almost none), so it leaves a lot to the imagination as to what ""One Eye"" is really all about. He is a very stoic personality.This movie was boring and difficult to sit through, while at the same time I was intensely intrigued by the rawness and mystery of what was going to happen. Having not read any reviews about the movie before watching it, I had an open mind about the film and was completely surprised by the way it turned out. The movie almost seems like a gritty, intense, and terrible dream.This is not a typical movie, so if you are looking for lots of action or wise cracks then look elsewhere. But, if you want to experience something quite bizarre and a little bit disturbing, check this out."
3,Valhalla Rising,"Valhalla RisingA visually stunning movie with beautiful cinematography. It shows the ultra violent experiences of a mute, maimed Viking slave. It's was difficult for me to discern a message or even a point to this film besides appreciating the exceptional visuals. Perhaps the message was that it was tough to be a Viking slave surrounded by mud, violence and ignorance? The brief combat scenes were brutal as they were superbly choreographed and left me wishing for more. But this was realistic and mirrors the reality of true medieval combat which was often brief and bloody. The voyage part of the movie on the boat was surprisingly boring and had me itching to hit the FF button of my remote. It is worth seeing for the first class visuals. However, once I had finished watching it I realized why I had not even heard of it until it was out of the movie theaters."
1,Typical Euro-junk,"Boring movie full of long scenes of nothing, people staring into space, sequences marked by lack of any action or movement. Inexplicable, pretentious and dull. Allegory shouldn't be a replacement for an engaging story."
2,"Mildly interesting, but also mildly abysmal.","Confusing in its vagueness, frustrating in its lack of goals, boring yet pierced briefly from time to time with interesting bits. I did not expect an action epic when watched it. It definitely wasn't. This movie was dreamy, detached, and did not convey well its intentions. It was picturesque, however. I enjoyed the character of One Eye, but his story was empty. Ultimately it was a poor movie that could have been so much better."
1,Utter Garbage,"Some of the scenery was nice.That's it. That's a far as I can go to find anything positive about this film.This film did not entertain, inform, provoke thought, or move me in any way. I could close my eyes, throw a dart at a listing of movies and have no worries that I would find one better than this.The trailer tricks you into thinking there may be some sort of story to be told. Even the first 10 minutes would lead you to believe this. Nope...don't bother waiting because nothing ever develops. The scene on the boat? Could that 30 minutes be any more mind numbingly boring? Yes, they're on a boat for a long time...we get it...let's wrap that bit up in 5 minutes vs 30 minutes of these guys staring at each other.Wait, once they get off the boat the story will get better...right? Nope. More nice scenery and that's it.Just utter garbage. I can't adequately put into words just how terrible I still feel after wasting my time watching this film. I expected better from Amazon."
1,"God, this is dreadful!!!","Every bit of my meanspiritedness comes out at this. Production values (lighting,sound, acting, etc) are generally poor.I expected too much of this turkey and therefore write disparigingly of it because I found it SO wanting."
1,The worst movie of the planet Earth! Damn!,"I bought this trash DVD thinking it would be a film about Vikings, Valhalla, Middle Ages, etc. Forget that stuff.There's nothing more, just a bunch of idiot artists with dirty clothes, rolling in the mud, there is no dialogue, no script, and the worst ''soundtrack'' from the earth, if it can be called music.The director of this film should be sentenced to life imprisonment, but first return the money to those who bought their junk movie.For the first time in my life, after watching this movie aberration, I literally bent and broken a DVD into several pieces and threw it in the latrine.Cursed be the director of this garbage. I hope that someday he would be arrested and hung upside down in a medieval dungeon. The worst movie of the planet Earth!"
1,Lots of Fuzzy Noise,"I bought this cd because of the novelty of a song that was around 50 min (the second song), little did I know that the album was just tough to listen to static.It's not worth the money just to have a 50 minute song that you'll never listen to all the way through."
2,Beware of a problem,"I bought three sets of these bits. Imagine my chagrin when I found out that they cannot be used in my DeWalt Cordless Impact Driver, DC825B. They will go into the driver, but not far enough to stay in. After driving a screw, when you pull the driver back, the bit falls out. If you put the bit into the driver but then carry it pointing downward, the bit falls out. This is a flaw that DeWalt should have caught or at least alerted tool users about the issue. I have a shop full of DeWalt tools. The first DeWalt tool I bought was 52 years ago, a radial arm saw that still runs just fine. Which is to say I am a DeWalt tool fan. But these DeWalt bits, well, shame on DeWalt."
2,Not a Holmes product,"After reading many of the reviews on this product before purchasing, I realized that I might not get a product actually manufactured by Holmes. As you can see by the Customer Photos I submitted, the filter was not manufactured by Holmes but fits my model Holmes humidifier. I cannot yet comment on how long the filter lasts as I just received it, but I also find that filter life fluctuates greatly with weather, use and care/cleaning of a humidifier."
1,Bait & switch,Company sent another product that did not work with the humidifier. Will never order from them again. Lost trust with non Amazon sellers. Lost receipt so not able to work this out with the customer service. Learned a lesson from this experience. Have bought this item before through Amazon with no problems. Will buy in stores from now on.
2,The product was fine but the service was terrible.,I bought this filter from Amazon because I didn't want to drive 25 miles to Super Walmart to get one. It took THREE WEEKS to arrive. I had actually forgotten about it. I wouldn't buy this type of product on Amazon again.
1,Amazon is lisitng the WRONG parts for the Kia Rio,"Amazon is lisitng parts for the 2008 Kia Rio that do not even exist. These spark plug sires do not fit the 2008 Kia Rio any model. The 2008 Kia Rio in Amazon is listed as a distributorLESS ignition system. The KIA Rio IS a distributorLESS system and therefore does NOT even HAVE a distributor, distributor cap, rotor, OR SPARKPLUG WIRES AT ALL. THEY DO NOT EXIST. Yet Amazon says these parts do exist and will sell them to you wasting time and money. The KIA rio has 4 cylinders, and 4 spark plugs and on top of the 4 spark plugs there are 4 coils (1 per) and NO distributor, distributo cap, rotor, or sparkplug wires."
4,Bosch 04303 Ignition Rotor - 1998 Honda Accord EX 3.0 V6,This rotor did look exactly like my old one but there was a problem with the alignment of the mounting bolt. It did not line up. I had to go to my local auto part store to get the right one. I contacted Amazon and they told me just go ahead and keep it and they will issue a refund - cool. I assuming this is for a different year/system?
3,A good deal but not the best collection,"This 2-CD set is worth it if only because it's got a very reasonable pricetag. As the other review mentioned if you are not into noise then don't bother with this one; it's not anything else. The Japanese acts as usual manage to provide a much harsher, more straightforward assault on the senses with contributions from more established artists such as Masonna, MSBR, etc. The American bands tend to integrate more musicality and attempt to impose a more musical context on the genre, which occasionally works but not usually. For fans of noise, this is interesting but not essential. If you're curious, though, this might be a good place to start in terms of price and quantity."
2,"Simplistic writing is one thing, but...","...just plain bad grammar and careless mechanical errors are another. I had a hard time muddling through this book, for the countless compositional mistakes were extremely distracting; the ""reading experience"" practically becomes ruined. Honestly, I'm not even sure how this novel made it past the presses with such slipshod work.In my opinion, one does not need anything akin to a magnifying glass or a college degree in order to detect said mistakes -- they practically jump out at you from the page.It's a shame that this story becomes overpowered by typographical errors, for its message contains positive, inspirational themes regarding self-esteem and spirituality. Oddly enough, Brown's writing seems to come alive (and error-free) during the intimate love scenes, of which I did thoroughly enjoy. But after the thrill has gone, the reader is left cold again with stale writing, a rushed ending, and even more typos."
3,The cape came off...,"We purchased this toy for our son's 5th birthday. When his little sister tugged the cape to grab the toy from him, the cape came off. It's not a good toy for rough play. It's better for collectors. Without Superman's cape, he's just not the same character!"
5,Can I give this 10 stars ? ? ?,An incredible blend of various music to soothe your soul - can be listened to over and over. This music transports me to another astral plane and I can't say that about too many CD's. Zam Zam is one of many excellent examples. When I need to go to my special place - this CD gets me there ! ! !
1,So boring,This was about the most boring thing I've ever seen. I want those minutes of my life back. Don't waste the money.
4,Try it!,I ordered this item a few weeks ago and my girlfriend likes it so much I'm going to order one for her too.If in doubt I suggest you go a size up.
2,Only good thing is Danielle Harris and she couldn't save it....,"If you follow my reviews you know I'm a pretty big horror movie fan. So for me the thing that drew me into this movie was the fact that Bill Moseley & Danielle Harris were in it. But really that's all this movie has going for it. I figured if those two were in it, chances were the movie had a higher budget then those low budget ""school project"" films. But I was wrong.This movie has bad writing, bad acting, plot holes, and loaded with filler. Overall it just isn't that great. If you'd like a more indepth review of this movie please visit my horror movie/book review blog listed in my profile."
1,Garbage,I love slasher movies but this one was horrible. The worst part was that there was not one sympathetic character. The kids are the most obnoxuos foul mouthed punks I've ever seen in a slasher and the plot was idiotic.Skip this big time.
3,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this movie. I do like the actress Danielle Harris, so maybe that made me more partial to it.So, I would recommend this movie to teen/ slasher/ horror fans."
4,bloody good time,"If you're like me and you miss old school slasher-type horror flicks, you'll find a lot to like here. An old ghost story taking on new life, a high school party, teenagers leaving the group to have sex... for the most part, you know what you're in for here, but it's a fun ride.One other note: I think the visual storytelling (for lack of another way to put it) really stand out. The special effects, lighting, editing, storytelling, and even the music are exceptional for what is apparently a fairly low budget project by a first-time director. There's talent on display here, and I suspect (and hope) we'll see more from the creative team in coming years."
4,Blood Night,i think this is a good movie. its scary and entertaining and u will like it. especially cuz it has danielle harris in it.
2,"Done and done again , and again","This movie took alls it cues from the 70's slasher flicks but unlike other reviewers, I don't think it accomplished its goal of being a ""send up"" to them. The effects were worse than the original 70's flicks, the cliches were done to death. It seemed like it was trying to be campy and scary but in the end failed in both. The only way I can see anyone giving this movie above 3 stars is if your 13 and have never seen a womens breasts before or you are getting paid to write good reviews. Save your money, not even worth the rental.If your looking for a horror movie to pass the time, so far I can recommend:Outpost,Splinter,and Alien Raiders. At least they are worth the rental price."
3,Fair Horror film,I actually got a kick out of this film. The special effects where fair and the film clips referring to a past event where good. Not you cinematic classic but worth a one time look.
3,Not good but gory,"This movie is one of those wishy washy horror movies that overloads on the gore and nudity to mask problems with it's premise (and the writing). Typical annoying ""bros and gals"" running around being boneheads and getting picked off one by one.It's watchable with a beer but without it will make your blood boil with it's average everything. I mean average EVERYTHING! The acting is average, the filming is average, the gore is average, even the women are average looking.I've seen worse and I've seen better from b-type horror movies. Just don't expect all that much entertainment."
3,Blood Night.....alright,This movie was alright not worth what i paid for it but im a fan of Bill Mosley and Danielle Harris movies. Story is nothing to great. There is a rape....and a baby....let you watch from there. Overall a better rent than a buy unless you can get it for $5.
5,Awesome speakers,"The Pyle Home PDIC81RD 8-Inch Two-Way In-Ceiling Speaker System,Is an awesome speaker.Only problem was the way it was packaged.It was a Box in a box with very little foam protection.Outside box came crushed in one corner,inside box the same but no damaged to product.Make sure you ask for extra protection for product delivery.Overall will order again."
1,no crossover of any kind,these speakers don't have any type of crossover - very cheaply made - spend a few more dollars and get something worth having
2,Shipping,One speaker came in cracked.Not packed very well.Already had someone hired to install. I had to put the cracked one up
4,Parent from Chicago Suburbs,"This is a cute, humorous book but parents BEWARE! This book is NOT for Santa believers."
5,Awesome Christmas Book!,"My son, 10.5 tore through it! He couldn't put it down. Something really cool, when your child is reading to themselves and they bust out laughing out loud."
3,"Good for reference (kind of), not for learning","Learning quantum mechanics from this book is not an easy thing to do. For instance, the section on Dirac notation is 3/4 of a page long, introducing a completely new tool that is used everywhere in the book. Once you have suffered through learning the material once, however, then a glance at the book will easily bring back memories of the material, along with the pain that kept you from sitting comfortably for weeks. So, overall, it's good for a reference book, but not especially good to learn introductory quantum mechanics from."
4,"Good, but somewhat slow","Overall, I found this book very well written and comprehensive. The only complaints I have about it are that it is somewhat slow, and that there is very little interesting material until the last chapters in the book (but I suppose that most presentations of quantum mechanics are organized like this)."
3,Important,"Before you attempt to study Quantum Mechanics, try taking classical mechanics first. If you don't understand operators and all that other mechanics stuff, don't bother trying to learn quantum mechanics yet. This book is certainly not for the beginning physics student who wants an ""understanding"" of quantum mechanics, no no, this is the real deal.I feel that one major drawback of this book is that it is written in numbers rather than letters and that someone who considers themselves prone to reading words rather than equations should look for an easier text.Although, if your taking, say an intermediate Quantum course, than you should consider this book."
3,Not a bad book but lacks depth,I used this books for two quarters and covered 13 chapters. Though the books is quite comprehensive it lacks depth. The chapter 8 on periodic lattice and energy gaps is not very clear and misses many derivations. However the book has many interesting problems that can help one understand the subject.
2,Do yourself a favor and get Griffiths,"Griffiths is clearly a better choice than this book; while it covers the material in an introductory undergraduate course, it definitely does not have good organization. Typographical errors are abound, and there are essentially very little helpful examples presented. I had to refer to multiple sources to learn QM, and as this was my first true book I read on quantum mechanics for self study, it definitely did a terrible job of a presentation.The reason I think this book gets two stars instead of one is that it gives a pretty good (decent) explanation of the fundamentals; even then, deciphering what he's trying to say can be difficult at times."
2,Liboff should stick to physics and not writing text books,"For an introductory quantum mechanics text, Liboff is way too dry. There is no easy way to introduce quantum mechanics for undergrads, but this book is simply unreadable. I'd go with Griffiths and stay away from Liboff."
3,Quantum book cover gauged,"I was dissapointed to find large deep scratches on the front cover of my ""new"" book. Other than that it was fine."
2,Newbound Milkglass Encyclopedia,"I find this book an invaluable tool. It is grouped in catagories and is a great assistant in hunting milkglass. I keep a copy in my car, one at my desk and another at my sister's home in Minnesota. Unfortunately, the prices are becoming outdated and are quite skewed. Some items have decreased in price while others have increased, but many dealers use it as a guide. It is up to the customer to learn the current asking prices."
3,Good Eye Candy,"Good resource for exceptional pieces, but it's not organized well, and does not cover most everyday pieces. Values are over-inflated, especially for what milk glass is selling for online."
5,Wonderful guide to milk glass,"This is a wonderful guide to the possibilities in milk glass collecting. I found much here that I never knew existed and the full color photos of each item are beautiful.The book is arranged by subject matter. Data on each item includes manufacturer, size, dates of production & current market value range. Some of my favorites are the kitchen utensils, lamps & beautifully decorated plates.There is a wealth of detailed information for collectors here. The introduction has some general collecting tips plus how to get a feel for old glass vs. new. Detailed histories of all the major producers follows.Finally, the catalog pages of more common recent lines by Westmoreland, Fenton and Imperial are reproduced with a value guide. This book really helped me understand and appreciate what milk glass is all about."
3,A Good Book for the Beginning Collector,"I bought this book 4-5 years ago and really liked it. But as I have collected more and more glass, and seen much more than was ever possible without e-bay (!) I do see the need for a more comprehensive reference. I don't think it should be billed as an 'Encyclopedia', in other words. Like another reviewer stated, I wish there were a LOT MORE info on each piece of glass shown. While the pictures are great, they leave me wanting MORE. And I'm starting to get away from buying price guides, as they are so quickly outdated. I will add, however, that if you are looking for a 'general overview' of the category you may find this book completely adequate and never need another. The pictures are good, and varied; my hunger for MORE MORE MORE is not shared by everyone. I do recommend this book, but for the veteran collector I think it would be a supplemental reference and not the main one."
3,"GOOD BOOK, BUT LACKING A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION","What is contained in this book is certainly good information. However, the problem I had with it is that it focuses mainly on very rarely seen pieces. It does very little in the way of everyday milk glass. It is a good book, but there is a wide open market for someone to publish a more comprehensive one."
2,Museum Pieces Only,"I pick up a lot of milk glass in thrift stores and was hoping this book would help me identify some of the pieces. Unfortunately, most of the items in this book have long been unattainable to the casual collector. The informational section was too short and poorly researched, and the author virtually ignored contemporary milk glass from makers like E.O. Brody, Anchor Hocking and Avon (only a few of Avon's dozens of milk glass pieces were featured).If you want a book about milk glass from 1950 to present, this isn't it. Hopefully someone will realize the need for a book that covers ""common"" milk glass, which is getting harder to find and will ultimately be tomorrow's collectibles."
4,"Research, Research, Research!",This book helped me identify unmarked pieces of milk glass with its extensive display of pictures and patterns. The book is fairly organized and covers many manufacturers that are not so well known.The only drawback was some pictures were not clear enough to carefully identify a pattern. This is only constructive criticism and should not keep you from using this book as part of a reference and identification guide for fine pieces of milk glass.
1,Entertaining for young kids but real message gets lost,"Entertaining for the Barney-set but I don't believe most children would ""get"" the fire safety message or understand how serious and dangerous fire is. A valiant effort but disappointing."
3,Curious George Lunch Box,"I learned how to fold paper boats from this Curious George book, and the back has a fantastic image of that story. The box overall, is a bit flimsy to use everyday , but it's too cute."
3,Cute but don't hold much.,"Like I said, cute but don't hold much. I purchased it for a lunch box but I'm an obese lard and it doesn't even come close to holding all the food I want to bring to work."
2,Made me hive,"I'm not going to say much, other than the fact that something in this product made me allergic, and I broke out in hives and itched like crazy for 2 days. But on the plus side, it did smell kind of nice."
4,Really does smell like Vanilla!,"I purchased this product on 8/13/2011 and it was here by that Tues. I was scared that the alchol would overpower the vanilla, but it didnt. Smells good. Have to spray alot to get it to last tho. Maybe pour some into a smaller oil bottle to carry around through the day. Goin to try other scents from this line too! Best sweet scents i ever tried and ive been looking!!!!!!"
1,Thumbs down this time.,"Vanilla Fantasy is all I have worn for the past 3 years, however, in January of this year when I ordered 6 bottles.....it had no frangrance at all. I complained to Amazon and was advised this seems to be a frequent issue now. I will not pay for an inferior product. Makes me sad, as in the past wearing it I received many compliments on its fresh smell."
1,Gag me,"Someone wore this into the workplace the other day. It was a smell I have encountered several times over the last year or so. It must be very cheap to be so popular. Between the itching and the instantaneous throat tightness it is an entirely unpleasant experience. Please, ladies (and gents?), don't wear this stuff out of the house."
1,Another unwelcome birthday present,"My vanilla-loving aunt's boyfriend hated this one. I guess it wasn't enough of a Fantasy. Not enough like Vanilla, he said."
5,"The Scent I Most Recommend, Especially If You're Single","If you have not yet, try THIS or any other Vanilla body spray/perfume/eau de toillette.I have received complimetns from guys for wearing vanilla scent. Vanilla is highly likely to get your man noticing you ( or if you're not with a man and looking, some are likely to pay notice to you ).Plus, I came to find vanilla scent to be the only one I really want to wear regularly.This deserves waaaaaaay beyond 5 stars!"
5,Nostalgic Scent,"I first encountered this spray in my mom's cabinet as a little girl. When i wore it to school everybody would say ""something smells so good or like cookies"". Well the bottle finished and i never saw it again till i was browsing online for a new set of sprays and saw this again. I have many perfumes and sprays but save this one for a special event or night out. I recieved so many compliments from this spray it is my all time favorite spray. Even the guy I'm dating love this scent so much! it's definitely a keeper!"
5,funny!,I loved the first book but this one is great as well! There are never too many laughs in this world!
3,It was a fun read.,"So Im 26 years old and my mother bought this in my teens. I still think fondly of this book. If you have a sarcastic teenager they will love it. Its a fun read when ur tired of hearing the upbeat, same-old holiday stories. I loved it."
2,"I enjoyed ""Bedtime Stories"" much more.","I looked forward to this book, because I thought ""Politically Correct Bedtime Stories"" was so funny. This was disappointing. The Rudolph story was okay, and Frosty was okay too, but all in all, the book was a great step down from ""Bedtime Stories."" Mr. Garner seems to have lost some of his clever wit, and he spends way too much time on Ebenezer Scrooge. That story turns out dry and extremely dull, I muddled through that one, and because Mr. Garner takes such length with it, it turns out to be half of the book. Not funny this time, Mr. Garner. Sorry."
4,ADEQUATE QUALITY/ LOW PRICE/ GOOD SIGNAL,"This is a very good cable assembly for a variety of video connecting needs. This should work well with any device that has these connectors. This should be a durable product too, with the actual signal wires using an adequate guage to provide a stable video/audio signal."
5,Works Like It Should.,Used this cable to run RCA to S-Video/Audio to my projector. No problems whatsoever. Plug it in and go. Quick shipping. Would buy from seller again.
3,BUYER BEWARE: THINGS AREN'T AS THEY SEEM (WRONG PICTURE),"I purchased this item for two reason. 1) The Cables To Go brand. 2) The photo displaying the item shows a thicker yellow video cable, which delivers a higher quality image that a thinner cable, which is what I received.Although I feel dupe, suckered, led astray, I will keep the item. With all that said, BUYER BEWARE!!!"
5,Does the job,I bought these when my boyfriend recommended I run my online streaming videos to my TV.I was a little concerned since I had never done anything like that but they did the job nicely and they're long enough to not limit me to having to sit too near.
4,Great For Everyday Use,"The RCA component cable is perfect for watching videos and movies that are on your laptop. The quality of movies are just as good as the quality you see on your laptop. However, if you plan on using this cable to do everyday things like surf the internet or type up a paper, you will have to adjust the size of the words because they become quite blurry."
3,Problem with the reception,"The quality of the cable is fine, however after hooking it up (computer to TV)The TV monitor is not clear, and it is nearly impossible to read anything on the screen. all the words are blurry. So I have not been able to use my TV as a monitor like I had hoped."
1,Picture is not what I got.,"The item shows a heavily shielded video cable and the description said gold plated connectors. However, the item I received from ClearAV was not what was described. I would recommend if you want to buy it, get from someone other than ClearAV."
1,Never received,"The tracking site said the product reached my post office, Cedar Creek, TX on 8/13. My post office searched several times, using the Amazon tracking page printout and could not verify it was actually received. The post office even checked the mail theft log and there were no reports from my neighborhood. I left a message on the Amazon tracking page but never heard back. I bought a similar item from Best Buy and wrote my order off as lost. So, I bought it twice.If this had been a high dollar item, I would have made a lot of noise about it.Shipment #1: Shipped on August 9, 2009 Delivery estimate: August 13, 2009 - 1 package via USPS - Total for this Shipment: $20.28"
5,Great cables great company,Buying locally was about impossible and expensive. This company delivered very fast and the cables are great. Got the longer ones since I often use motel TVs and it is hard to find a good place to rest the laptop.
2,Not very good,"The sound qaulity is still okay, but the video quality is bad; i have to view my LCD from quite a distance to watch it otherwise is blur."
1,God Awful,"Really? I mean, Really? This is one of the worst movies of all-time. Please don't waste your time with this one. Weekend at Bernies had a better plot than this excuse for a movie."
1,Someone owes me 1 1/2 hours of my life back,This was literally the worst movie I've ever seen. I equate the pain of watching this movie to having a red-hot rod jammed in my eye-socket. I would rather lasso a down-syndrome elephant than watch this movie again. The producers should have better invested the money spent making this movie on buying a stick of Trident. Do yourself a favor and read a book or go jogging...anything other than watching this movie.
1,They made FOUR? puh-leez,"Ok, Iron eagle #1 was pretty awful. #2 was boring and I won't even start on #3. Well, 4 takes the cake. Our formally feather-haired hero, Doug, is alive and back. He's in his 30's and is generally disappointed with the world. Naturally, helping unlikable brats makes everything better. (These cuties include a drug runner, a junior john and a hacker, all of whom are given full access to computers and airplanes!) Doug naturally falls for one of the kids, kinda gross considering she is under 18. Anyway, the overly-violent plot centers around germ warfare. Whatever."
4,More of Carbonetti's gorgeous work--advice for creativity,"This is not a painting how-to book. Making Pearls is Vermont artist Jeanne Carbonetti's attempt to verbalize her creative exercises she uses and teaches for her free style of watercolor.If you are a fan of Carbonetti's paintings, there are many photos of her work in this book to drool and marvel over. There is one useful exercise--making a ""creation cycle"" using the seven colors based on the India Chakras. Her theory is that we are always within the cycle of creation and need to recognize where we are in the cycle to be in rhythm with the flow. If you can't take one of her workshops, using this book can lead you through the exercise.Why ""Making Pearls"" as a title? This is a metaphor for taking irritations of daily life and making something beautiful from them, just as the oyster takes a grain of sand and creates a pearl."
2,"Well, the Merzbow half's good...","Merzbow gives us five tracks of pure sludge, right up the alley of the rest of his 90s work-- a solid wall of noise with enough going on behind it to make it somewhat interesting. It's not his finest work of this period (for that, head for 1994's Venereology [Release] or 1997's Akasha Gulva [Alien8]), but it's certainly serviceable Merz.Then, there's Bastard Noise's contribution. I've since seen them live, and either they've improved mightily as a noise band in the past four years, or these were outtakes recorded while the members had some sort of odd tropical disease that causes everything a person records to become utterly unlistenable.For the Merzbow completist only."
2,Axioms? Nah!,"The author tries to make his design methodology a science. However, the two axioms in his theory were drawn from past ""good"" design examples by his own judgement, rather than common sense that everyone perceives. You can easily find many design examples that ""violate"" his design axioms, but remain well-accepted and good designs nowaday, such as integrated design modules, side-open fridge, etc. Over all, this book provides an alternative design philosophy. Design axioms? Maybe too ambitious...."
5,Excellent Study,"Doing this study has directed me and helped me to understand certain scriptures which have shown me the truth in who I am in and through Christ. With the help of this study, my relationship with Jesus has deepened and sharpened like never before. I finally understand that it is about staying continually focused on Jesus and not on myself. I think EVERY Christian woman should do this study, no matter where they are in their walk. It is one of my favorites."
4,Because of Jesus.,This book is a must read for all women. This book will help a women with her family life and her life in general.
5,AMAZING,"This is by far the best Bible Study I have ever done. It has changed my life! I now understand that I am righteous and virtuous because of JESUS! I can stop trying and trying and trying and just focus on trusting Him. Then, everything else falls into place. There are pages of scripture verses that I refer to every day. You should buy this study and share it with your friends. It will change your thinking and your life!"
5,Great Guide!,"I just bought the 2003 edition of this book, and I must say it is great! The pics are very good! On some of the variable species, there are more than one photo to show you the different forms. The author provides great information on every aspect of the snakes' lives including size, reproduction, prey, habitat, and relative abundance. The book is very easy to read and is a steal at that price for 600 well written pages on North American snakes!- Anthony J. Chodan"
5,Excellent for home and field use,"Excellent book for novice and experienced alike. Tons of pertinent, useful information. This is a great book for educating entry level herpers. This is not a typical field book, having far more useful information for each species than most I have used. This is particularly helpful when dealing with similar species. More info on typical habitat, range, size, coloration, diet, etc. makes identification easier. A great addition to any library."
2,not a field guide,"this book is well written and contains good information and if i was writing a report on a particular snake this would be a good place to turn. but as a field guide it sucks. unless you already know what kind of snake you're looking at, it'll take forever to find it in the book. pictures need to be WITH the snake's info not in the middle of the book."
4,good book,i bought this as a present for my father in law. He sometimes has a snake here and there in the backyard and wants to know what kind it is. This is a good book to know about local snakes.It has nice clear pictures of the snakes to compare too and then little info about that snake.This is not for very detailed info though.
1,"Life is NOT 10,000 hours","10,000 hours = 416 days. In other words, more than a year.I bought this replacement bulb on Oct 6, 2005. Today is the first of Feb. 2006--it died. Assuming that I never turned off the lamp during those 3 months, my math tells me that in order for the bulb to burn out I must have had the lamp on for 111 hours/day for five months. (111 hours x 30 days x 3 months = 9990 hours.) Only, I never quite lived a 111 hour day yet.If I figure I used the lamp for no more than 6 hrs/day for those 3 months. I only got 540 hours out of it. However you look at it, it seems this bulb missed the mark on the 10,000 in a premature death."
2,poor equipment,I just purchased the CS101 floorlamp for my wife for a Christmas present. The bulb lasted less than 20 hours and the company would not honor the warranty because I bought this light from Amazon. We had this product for less than 2 months as it was a present.
1,Drop the Product,Purchased two bulbs. Both burned out within a couple of hours.Worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon.
5,Grandrich 27-Watt Fluorescent Bulb,Seems that Amazon is the place to get what you want for a reasonable price!!Looked high and low for this product and couldn't find it any cheaper and received it quick.
1,Very bad product,"Bought 2 of these bulbs to replace original in Grandville floor lamp. The original lasted over 2 years, until I broke it. These replacements are bad . 1 lasted for 3 months, the other 20 minutes. Don't waste your money on these bulbs."
4,Ms. Energy,"I go to amazon for many of the items I need. Stores, if you find them, don't often stock parts. Amazon is easy to use, ship quickly and products are quality."
3,SolarTech Brass Lamp,"I have Solartech Lamp purchased from Technipeal Digital Products, Norwalk CT. which goes on and off, sometimes off for a few days and unable to repair it. I purchased replacement lamp for FML27EX-N type PL/F but it doesn't work either. Probably no problem with the bulb. Thjis is model bqalanced spectrum floorlamp."
1,Beware--odd size prongs.,"I bought a great reading lamp and the ""purchased together"" box indicated the lamp was often purchased with a full spectrum bulb so I bought both but when the bulb arrived, over one month after the lamp arrived, found the bulb totally useless as it has the new type of prong."
5,It works,"The place that sold me the lamp did not carry the replacement light bulb. Amazon did. It works, the price was right, the shipping was good and I like the light produced by this replacement. Would buy it again and would reccoment this to anyone."
1,Very Poor Product,"Purchased one in March 2011 as a spare replacement bulbFinally used it in early November 2011 it lasted between 7 and 10 dayshardly the promised 10,000 hours. Immediately had ordered this one also asa replacement and it is flickering; now they say 7000 hours. It has beenless than two days. I'm calling Amazon."
1,poor quality,"I used this bulb to replace the orignal one, which I have used for almost two years until I broke it. This bulb looks similar to the orignal one. However, it stopped working after I used for the third time. It works no more than 20 hours. Very disappointed. However, amazon offered me a replacement order and I am thinking of giving it a second trial."
1,difficult,"I was ssent the wrong item and that item was broken. Called the company and had difficulty understanding the person on the phone. Finally, the person on the phone said my account would be credited and I did not need to send the item back."
2,went back,"I bought one despite multiple warnings from fellow reviewers, I thought ok, I'll try it, it's only $7. Well, it just did not work. I'm giving it 2 stars and not 1 star, but all the starss belong to Amazon - I'm getting my money back."
1,this bulb doesn't work,"I bought this Grandrich light from Amazon and I turned it on once for 20 minutes and it died. So much for the 10,000 hours longer than most bulbs. I won't buy this product and I'm thinking twice about Amazon for selling it."
5,Easy to find and a quick ship,After a lengthy search around the area in two minutes I found what I wanted on Amazon. Keep up the good work
1,Left in the dark...,"I actually tried the bulb in my lamp and it fit, but it didn't work. I don't know if shipping damaged it in any way or if it was just not going to function. The bulb looks perfectly fine. So, needless to say that being left in the dark with a new product does not make me a happy camper(customer) !"
1,Died after 2 months,"Enough said. I figured I would be one of the lucky ones, but I wasn't. If I could give 0 stars I would."
4,Great fun!,"Travel agents and veteran cruisers alike will get a big kick out of this book.It's a behind the scenes look that pulls no punches but manages to remain affectionate. Garin simply proves that you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. I certainly hope it doesn't discourage any non-cruisers from taking the plunge.My favorite bit: Carnival's Meshulam Zonis' line, ""A passenger is like a wet towel,"" which he illustrated by hand motions that wordlessly said, ""First we squeeze them this way, then we squeeze them that way."""
4,Enlightening,Facination history of the Miami cruise industry from a journalist's business perspective. Finished the book and wanted more - wanting to know more of the inside scoop on what has happened since the book was published. I love cruising and this book provided enlightment to the big business behind the vacation. Appreciated the author's style and sequencing of the overall story line. Only reason I gave it a 4 stars instead of 5 was the level of detail behind some of the deals made was more than my interest and attention span allowed.
4,Cruise Book,"As the owner of a travel agency, I found this book fascinating. It gives a great history of the 2 major cruise lines, Carnival & Royal Caribbean, and the history of their rivalry over the years. I am not sure that this book is for the everyday cruiser, but if you are involved with the cruise industry I would consider it a must read."
2,shame on Amazon for such poor packaging,"I received my Staub 6.25 Quart Bouillabaisse Pot, Blue in a box without any packaging except a thin layer of bubble wrap. There were chips in the lid and around the rim of the pot. My feeling is that some of the extensive damage was done before the packaging. I'm hoping inspections are completed ""before"" mailing so this will not happen again. I have received an email that my replacement will take several weeks since there are none in stock. I'm wondering since my product was so damaged, if I received a return myself."
5,"great, great, great","Masonna is without doubt one of the most brutal noise artists around. But however brutal his music may be, to my opinion it is very atmospheric. Inner Mind Mystique is an outstanding album from Maso, and as the prevoius reviewer pointed, each track has memorable parts, with psychedelic atmospheres. However, I'd say that Maso's style is monotonic, but in a positive way. Thus, his style can easily be recognized. If you would like to hear something very, very powerful yet beautiful in it's intensity and very atmospheric, buy this album now!"
2,Torn,"I am torn with this purchase. From day one our older chocolate lab loved this bed and it seemed to ease arthritis pain. The younger dog in the house and visiting dogs also loved it. Unfortunately, it has been under two months and the middle of the bed has sagged considerably, so it needs replacing. I expected more for $140.I would rate this bed as five stars if the product held up --- alas....."
3,a little disappointed,Was very excited to get it....my dog loved it...he needs a good bed due to hip problems. It has quickly flattened in the middle. A bit disappointing. I had hoped it would last longer. I guess for $100 that is what you get.
2,keep looking,"i bought this bed thinking the removable cover would be a plus. the cover had holes in it, after the second wash. since this is a dogs bed it does require frequent washes. within the first 2 months i was having to cover the cover. the foam mattress is a glorified eggcrate and extremely difficult to clean, with a vacumn. the foam has a big sag in the middle of it, and my arthritic dog won't lie on it anymore.this is not a year old and needs to be replaced."
3,nice dog bed,Starting to sag under the weight of my 100+ pound akita so a lighter weight dog might be better but he loves it anyway!
5,Very engaging,"A great read for anyone interested in modern China. Set in modern Beijing, this is a thrilling mystery. Could not put it down."
3,"Less than ""Death of a Red Heroine""",This story introduced interesting new aspects of modern China but failed to hold my attention as much as the first Chen book.
2,Kindle - Last Pages Have Been Cut Off,"In the Kindle Version of When Red is Black, you don't get the last pages of the book. It simply stops mid-quote. A very disappointing experience."
5,Loved It!!!,This music is very relaxing and peaceful. I use it to teach my yoga/stretch class. I highly recommend it.
5,Sleep Fairy,"I got this as my baby shower gift and didn't use it right away. When my baby turned two months, I realized he's a light sleeper and would wake up at the slightest sound and that's how I decided to give it a try. This has been one of the best tools that aids him to fall asleep quickly, day and night. As soon as he's fed, tucked in his blanket and turn on the teddy bear...he just snoozes.. I love it and would recommend it to other moms."
3,Great CD but missing something......,"I really liked this CD, I LOVE SEVEN WITCHES, but I think there was something just missing from this CD. The first song is by far the best on the CD, Metal Asylum.... its awesome..I just couldnt get into the others too much.. maybe its only cause I havent had it long enough to grow on me, but a good CD no matter what the music is, grabs you the first time you listen to it, this one has yet to grab me anywhere :(There are a few other good tunes on it, but listen to it yourself, you may think otherwise !!!!"
4,Traditional Metal for the Ages,"Wow...This is Good. It's heavy, fast, lots of licks (LEAD GTR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), cool words than you can understand. And that My formula for for great metal.Long live METAL, until deaf do us part...JRK"
5,educational and exciting,"We have all 4 Popular Mechanics videos. They are among my children's favorites. They just wish theat there were more. The whole series is very informative, yet presented in a very entertaining way. There are two children who narrate and actually participate in all the activities ina very hands-on approach. My children wish they could be in their place.This one shows how they made the Aquarium of The Pacific in Long Beach. It shows how they built the exhibits, how they dove into the ocean to acquire the fish and the finished product. Full of wonderful information and brought down to a child's level of understanding.The second part of the video is about zoos. It is also very educational and fun."
1,Already outdated.,"...This book reminds me of a very poor Marketing 101 textbook. It lacks style. It is badly designed and written. It lacks interesting examples and is therefore dull. Ultimately, it does not deliver on its promises.As a product, it is the precise opposite of good branding!For anyone with even basic understanding of marketing and branding principles, there's nothing new here. Further, although it was published in late 2002, it frequently cites forecasts that go only through 2000 or 2001.I was extremely underwhelmed."
5,Love it!,I really love this oil. It is thick so easy to use. I really enjoy the smell. Great ingredients. Will definitely order again.
3,smells like...,"This is marketed as a coconut oil because it is the main ingredient. However, it smells nothing like coconut. It smells like anise and ginger cookies. Still a sweet smell, but just not like that sweet coconut smell that you might be expecting. It does work well in my hair (dred locks). It keeps my scalp and locks moisturized and lusterful. I would recommend using it for that reason."
2,Package is Misleading!!!!!,"Vatika oil is a great oil. I love it on my hair. HOWEVER...the bottle shown on this page is NOT the bottle I received in the mail. What I was received was the new re-formulated Vatika oil in the new sleek curvy container. As such, the ingredients are different from the original formula. Though I loved the old formula, I have no idea how this new formula will hold up. The vendor needs to update the photo so people are aware of what they are purchasing. Some ppl might not want the new formula. Two stars for false advertisement.ETA 2013I've given myself sometime to compare the two formulas and can honestly say I prefer the original. It smelled better. My original review stands as is."
5,love!!,this product smells gret feels great and it also does its job. helps dry scalp and my hair has a beautiful shine and my hair feels so soft.
1,Misleading,"I received the wrong item.After ordering the item pictured (Dabur Vatika Hair Oil 300 ml oil), I received dabur amla hair oil. I attempted to leave seller feedback, but was met with error message.I have never had any problems ordering items on amazon before, but this is unacceptable. I purchased my product from Herbal Beauty Supply (USA SELLER)in good faith,and will never do so again."
5,Oil,"Made my hair soft , gave it shine , just the right amount of moisture without it feeling greasy .but when i received it it was like curdled inside and hard to get it out ! I don't think it was supposed to be like that , but other than that the product was a good product plan on buying it again when i run out :)"
2,book,the book showed some water damage to some of its pages which made it difficult to open and turn said pages.
1,Looking for a great product for the blind? Keep looking!,"As a blind mom, I got one of these so I could use it for myself and for our kids. The voice is loud and clear, but that's the only thing that works right on this thing. Not only is it not clinically accurate it's not even in the ballpark. If your looking for a good product for the elderly, blind or low vision, or even something to make it easier as a sighted parent to use with your kids, THIS IS NOT IT. You're better off using the back of your hand to feel their forehead. That will get you more quick and accurate information than this thing will tell you. What a total and complete waste of money!"
4,Nice to have.,It's been great having this set. I only wish the components wouldn't rust so quickly. Though I'm sure the humid FL air doesn't help much. :)
4,Works well,"This product works well with my Dewalt power drill, however, it seems to wear quicker then I thought it would when unscrewing subfloors. I still like it though"
3,"Another Fine DeWalt Tool, But...","DeWalt has once again invested a lot of time in developing a very heavy duty and highly functional tool, but there is one hitch. The locking mechanism uses a small metal ball inside the thumb collar to hold the Drill/Driver assembly in place. To change, simply disengage the collar and flip the unit and re-lock. The only problem is that when the driver end is in the chuck, the magnet tends to prevent the ball from leaving the grove it is in and makes the switch very tricky.I had to remove the magnet to continue using the unit without loosing my sanity, but in doing so lost the magnetic function so helpful in holding screws and bits securely.*** If any one associated to DeWalt reads this, might I make a little suggestion: go with a NON-FERROUS ball***"
4,Good lightweight bowl,A great size and weight bowl for popcorn and other snacks in front of the TV. Smooth surface is easy to clean.
5,everything I wanted,"I was already familiar with this product, I just needed 2 more. Amazon delivered them faster than I expected and packaged them perfectly. I always get great service from Amazon."
4,A Colorful Cast of Berkeley Characters,"This is a good mystery. It takes place in Berkeley, California and has a colorful cast of characters - hippies, scam artists, vegans, street people and disability activists. A female Private Investigator is trying to solve the mystery of a murdered handicapped activist. Side plots abound.This is a good page-turner and fun to read."
5,Best for a quick answer.,"I used this book all through my missionary training. I had 6 semesters of theology and I found this book indespensible for one use. This is the book that gives a truly concise definition for a word you are struggling to understand. This is by no means exhaustive, but I used it and still refer to it in the same way I refer to Websters when I need a definition."
5,Amazing!,"This collar has been great! We've had it for years and it still looks brand new! They swim in it and we've had no problems. It bleeds a little, but thats not a problem. We were looking to get a new one for my other dog, but sadly I can't find it anywhere online :( It's too bad because it's difficult to find such a high quality item for the price."
5,Great Stuff,"Gene Wolfe is the perfect short story author. His stories are accessible to fans of any genre, but will be especially rewarding to fans of fantasy, s f, or magical realism. The stories in this book, although supposedly ""new science fiction stories"" really fall into all three of the above categories. I also purchased Wolfe's other fairly recent collection, ""Innocents Aboard"" and found it to be excellent also. Each book features a good mix of very short (2-3 page) stories, and longer, not quite novella length stories.Wolfe's settings are diverse, ranging from a far off desert planet to a short story set on the far future ""Urth"" of his Book of the New Sun Series, to places as seemingly mundane as Houston, TX, or the set of a present dayish reality tv show. Of course, Wolfe's stories are never mundane, and it is in taking a place that holds no magic and twisting our perceptions so that we come away with a sense of wonder that Wolfe really excells."
2,not my kind of sf,"Sorry to say, though I really loved his furry fiction, this collection leaves me flat. I like a story with a beginning and middle and an end. These are all guessing games and mind trips with WAY too much left unsaid and barely even hinted at for the most part. I would not suggest this unless you like that kind of fiction. The author begins with a great idea for a story in several of these, but then abandons it in my opinion. Like I said....not my cup of tea."
5,A Great Collection,Here is Gene Wolfe at his finest. I have no complaints about this collection at all. Anyone who already likes Wolfe should love this collection.
5,Wolfe on top of his game...,"This book is another collection of Gene Wolfe short stories. Unlike the last couple, which were somewhat inpenetrable, this volume is filled with great stories, mixed with a couple of gems.About the only useless bit is the introduction, which merely lists the stories and says a tiny amount about their origin.There really are no clunkers in this volume. It's a page turner and a great introduction to possibly the best writer working in SF today."
5,Excellent reference book,"If I can settle on one pattern, I plan to make a dress for my daughter's Young Queen Victoria doll thatI was lucky enough to find in an antique shop."
5,A very entertaining read,"I love Raymond Feist's world of Midkemia. Shadow of a Dark Queen continue the hours of enjoyment I've had reading his books. Again he's given us great characters, Eric and Rupert. Feist has a gift for writing, and he continues to keep me turning the pages well into the night. Bravo"
5,Ther first Feist book I've read....,"I'm not one usually for fantasy, but this storyline fascinatedme. The importance placed on some characters that aren'teven in the book yet, but were main characters in hisprevious saga, made me want to read the entire Riftwarsaga. So that is what I'm doing. Really a good read.."
4,One of the finest fantasies I have read,"Exciting story, easy to read and understand and visionize.One of my top 10."
5,Better than I expected,"I got this book with the last of my Christmas gift certificate money. While Feist may not be a Geroge RR. Martin he does manage to craft an enjoyable story with charecters that you can care about, particularly Erik and Roo, but I also like Bingo. There are times when the story seems to fall into a pattern but it never stays there for long.Wonderful read I think this serise will tide me over untill the next book in A Song of Ice and Fire comes out."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"If I could, I'd give it negative 5 stars. Definitely the worst book I've ever read. Couldn't continue at all after chapter 3. Why? The main characters are so pathetic and hatable."
4,Pretty bloody good,"Really enjoyed this one. Liked the main character, Eric, too.FEIST doesn't write with the depth of a DONALDSON or MARTIN, but what he does do, is entertain. This is a good piece of escapism that'll fill in a rainy day just fine!"
2,Regurgitated Riftwar,"This book, while probably entertaining to those reader who haven't read Feist's previous Midkemian series, was pathetically close to his previous series in characters and plot. People from another world come through a portal to take over Midkemia, and the world is further threatened by The Valheru and Pantathians. The secondary characters are predictably eliminated, while the primary characters appear to be lifted from Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series. Feist is apparently hoping most of his readers haven't read his previous series, or at least are so enthralled by his previous characters that they want more of the same"
4,A good addition,"This series is a good addition to the Midekema series. There are new interesting characters and a interesting plot. If you have read Feist's other books this is a must read, if you haven't it is still very good. It has a heated ending that won't let you put the book down."
3,"Okay, but the editorial errors were irritating.","The plot involving Roo was banal at best. I enjoyed the first novel, so I wanted to find out more about what happened in the story. Unfortunately, so much of the story involved Roo. Also, there were so many poor choices of wording, and I'm thinking it was a case of lack of good editing. For example, the got into the ""carnage"" instead of carriage. There were quite a few more errors; too many to mention. I have never read a book with this many errors, and I found it irritating."
1,Garbage,"Feist's other series was passable. This one was horrible. The characters were unrealistic and stupid. I hated them throughout the whole book and only kept reading because I hoped they would be killed! The whole plot is unbelievable. Using convicts in an army, whatever? If this worked in real life, we could use serial killers in the army, and save money training the real thing!The characters are shallow and about halfway through the book just suddenly change and become different people. The whole book is just a thinly veiled rewrite of his first series, unfortunately a very poor rewrite.I will never understand why people enjoyed this garnbage, or why Feist is so popular. If anything he is a very mediocre writer and this latest series was absolute trash."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Suicide mission better than hanging around.When a couple of young men get into trouble and are goaded into some foolish action i.e. attacking rich guys when they get mad, it is execution for them.After a nasty near death poo your pants scaffold experience they realise they have been given a reprieve of sorts. Time for a Dirty Dozen experience. So, horrible boot camp trainig for them and others like them, because there is a Dark Lordess that needs stopping."
3,"If you have nothing better to read, why not?","Feist is an author that manages to write readable books simply though sheer pleasantness. This characters in this series are striat out of a seventh heven episode. They take everything so seriously, and with such innocence. While this is not the formula for great literature (I find the number of five star ratings puzzling), it has a certian appeal. The world is well drawn out, especally for people who have read some of his earlier series (I haven't).This story focuses around two... from a small town named Erik and Roo. They commit a crime and are forced to flee from their homes, which eventully leads them to become soldiers, set to fight a new threat to the world.As I was alluding to before, how cute. These two characters will run around, fight many battles and meet a lot of people all of the while never quite losing their charming innocence. This series is not in the same league as Jordan, Hobb, or Martin, but that doesn't stop it from being fun."
4,Shadow of a Dark Queen,Raymond E Feist is a master of the fantasy genre. The characters are well drawn and the characteristics of the main ones are expanded nicely. There is a good balance between prose and conversation. The plot builds and you can't wait until you can start the next book in the saga to find out what happened to your favorite characters. Will they survive? be injured? triumph? I would recommend this saga to fantasy readers.
4,Thank you!,Book was listed new but it doesnt look new.. looks used and has some creases but still in good shape! thank you
5,Awesome band and album,"This is one of my favorite bands. Their album before this one is probably even better ""Hallowed & Hollow"".They have only 2 albums out and both of them are great."
4,Nice documentary on my beloved city though I had higher expectation.,"Overall, a nice documentary on Asmara though I had higher expectation.But I can't believe that the people who produced this DVD put Ethiopian music as background/soundtrack when they should have used Eritrean music. I have nothing against Ethiopian music - in fact I listen to it all the time - but this is a documentary on Eritrea's capital and not Ethiopia's. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of great Eritrean instrumental music that they could have chosen from for this project. To me this is unacceptable, shameful and completely shocking!Other than that everything else is alright, though I wish the film was a bit longer, may be 90 minutes or so. Also, I would have liked to see a few more buildings added in the film as Asmara has one of the world's most remarkable concentrations of modernist architecture."
2,Don't Deal with this Company,"The Jersey came with a hole in the armpit. I also paid extra for 2nd Air and it didn't arrive on time. Granted that wasn't the Seller's fault but their promise to refund me the extra shipping costs was never realized. I called and emailed them for a few weeks and each time I was promised the refund. It's been 1 month since then and still no refund.Oh, well, you want to be greedy Seller, this is what you get. Hope it's worth the few bucks you owed me."
5,Drew Brees Jersey,High quality jersey that looks like an actual player jersey at a great price. My 17 year old son loved it!!! Received in a couple of days after I ordered it during the Christmas shipping season.
4,Worth it for the price,"Cheap jersey worth the money (everything is solid), but some of the logos weren't on all the way and it has a funny fold on both sleeves. If you want a really nice jersey this is not the one, if you want a heavy duty one that you wear out to the bar, don't care about getting a lil' dirty this is it."
2,wast of money,"this had a lot of stories that were less than 5 minutes, some of the choices were less than as advertised."
2,Already returned for a refund,"Wanted B&D toaster oven to replace old one. We ignored other negative reviews because we knew what we wanted. Looks great, but this model did not perform well. You cannot 'dial back' the settings if you decide you want lighter toast/less time; you have to wait for it to finish the cycle first, and by then your toast will be burnt. The timer was defective; it ticked when first set, but then stopped. The light indicator stays on regardless of what the toaster is doing. Will not likely purchase B&D soon."
1,Disappointing...,"I purchased this toaster oven after having had a Black and Decker toaster that lasted for more than 15 years. The timer was hard for the kids to set, but the real disappointment is how poor quality it is. I had this one for less than 6 months and this week noticed a funny smell when using, now it doesn't work at all. Very disappointed and I will likely be looking at other brands."
5,awesome remixes!!!!!,leann rimes sounds great with the remixes put to her voice. this cd is a must have for people who like dance music and are fans of leann rimes. it's worth the money you get the greatest hits of leann rimes remixed. THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE!!!!
2,Sunscreen,The screen was difficult to attach and to add to it....had to be attached to the pen with ties that can't be removed....so once it's attached the only way to take it off is to cut the ties......NOT happy with that!!!
5,Wish I had found these sooner !,"We bought a property that required a lot of ""un-building"" a while back. Along the way we discovered that the previous owner had apparently used regular phillips screws for years but then decided to switch to square-recess ones instead.Pretty much every de-construction job seemed to involve a constant switching between the two types bits on my Dewalt driver. About every third time I put one down to make the switch I forgot it and lost it!With these the bit-switching process is a quick five-second job flipping the bit - and I've got a lot fewer lost bits. I'm even thinking of switching to square-recess screws for my next projects."
3,Not bad,"This book could have been more concise and less dry. It could've been a lot of things, but it is what it is: a book on clinical social work practice. It's a good source of information, but isn't fun to read."
5,"Low-salt, low-fat, low-sugar, high-quality, superbly tasty","Hot Of The Grill: The Healthy Exchanges Electric Grilling Cookbook by television talk show host JoAnna M. Lund showcases 150 easy to make, hearth and body healthy recipes specifically intended for use with an electric grill.

5,thank you john,"you helped me get started on repairing a faulty crick on my new post&beam; , its still on the honey do list - but in the mean time , your book helped me build a solid outbuilding with hand built trusses that I never thought I'd be able to lift alone. In fact , the whole building went up alone. Never could've done it without you.And I finally understand how to measure out rafters ! thanks for the simple math."
3,Good stuff needed more,"John Carroll's book working alone was a bit of a dissapointment in that I was expecting perhaps too much. When it arived I was expecting it to be a full sized book but instead it was a rather small 5 3/4"" x 8 3/4"" sized 148 page book. I personally thought that His other book Measuring, Marking & Layout was a better buy. If you work alone the tips and hints in this book could save you a lot of time & frustration."
5,"Yes, I can do it!",Just a quick note...the concept of working alone is inspiring. I have to do a lot of jobs around my property by myself and the ideas and the how to's in the book help a lot. Just reading the book for it's tips and techniques get me off my butt and doing things I would not have tried otherwise. Many common sense techniques I would have never thought to do.Thanks for writing the book.
4,Working Alone Review,"""Working Alone"" provides some very interesting and completely workable ideas for completing a project alone. It not only provided complete details of the process recommended, but also points out key planning steps prior to using the tip. It was worth the price."
2,incomplete,"book left me feeling I was missing something, graphics were vertualy nonexsistant, tips were mostly common sense and without a clamp or two this man wouldn't be able to work. I was looking for new and inovative ideas too help me in my solo indevers and got nothing."
3,The pros are right.,"While I don't do so at the moment, I have made a living as a contractor. This book may be great for a novice but if you're a pro and don't know most of this stuff already maybe you should find someone to apprentice to...I did learn one or two things, but this book is no where near the tome of magic answers some of the reviews imply it is."
1,Working Alone: Tips and Techniques for Solo Building,"If you have never done any type of construction, buy this book. Even if you have only visited a construction site once in your life this book is below your expectations. The majority of the book is showing that taking two pieces of wood nailed at 90 degrees with a triangle placed perpendicular to the joint in different jobs. I thought I would learn something new but I was wrong. I would have returned it but it would cost just as much to ship it back as it cost in the first place."
5,very nice,"lots of good ideas that i will be using, i enjoyed this book and showed it to other people in the trades who also were impressed by some of the techniques,Because most people in the trades never work completly alone a lot of professionals dont know these ideas. however; John if you are reading this i would like to have this available for my kindle."
2,Alone,"Some good practical hints in this book - simple things that we all might figure out, but this helps speed up the process."
3,"Ok, but not the best","This book has some helpful info, however it is not very fluid when reading. I found that reading through it was somewhat like drudgery, not very enjoyable. But if you are up for it I am confident that most will find some of its contents to their benefit."
4,Frothing Tip,I purchased the Frothing Tip because my Krups was making beautiful bubbles instead of froth. I cleaned the old tip in vinegar and it still made bubbles. This new tip produced froth. So I am very pleased with it. I should mention I've since replaced the Krups with a Breville Ikon Espresso machine.
3,Not as good as it looks like,"The item is much better than the original model, however after some time it did not work properly. The steam is not enough to make good cappuccino."
2,Doesn't work well with windows 7,"The hardware is good, but the software is terrible. The drivers on the website for Windows 7 caused many of the audio jacks on my new LGA 1155 motherboard to stop working. I had to reformat my harddrive and reinstall windows to sort the drivers out. Avoid this if you don't have an older computer."
4,Good,"Pros: Well first off I'd like to say that over all this is a good buy for the price.Low feed back on the channels. Small amount of gain without too much feed back possible, but that is to be expected for the price.I like the double channel feature, which lets you put one mic into channel 1, and another into channel 2, which makes multi-track recording inside your software possible, which is a cool feature.It's light weight, which is handy, wont fall hard, wont take up much space.It even seems to have some light weight metals in the exterior protection.Cons: I find myself wanting a more expensive sound card now. I pretty much has to restart my computer ever time I use it, otherwise I get pops, clicks, and distortion. Though I believe that could be due to my own cpu speed. In any case it gets old."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Great price for a portable usb mic pre. But you definitely get what you pay for. The audio quality is extremely poor, and it quite often crashed the system. If you are doing simple recordings like podcasts or just getting scratch tracks for song ideas, this is the item for you. Otherwise, save your pennies up for the Lexicon Omega, or the paragon of portable audio interface: the Mbox 2."
3,Everything good except...,Except a little noise behind the recording.Something not bad that can be reduced with a noise reduction plugin.For the price is perfect with his numerous outputs and inputs and for the preamp very well built.Good deal for home recording.
1,VISTA Support updated,"Update: Looks like they actually came through with the VISTA drivers, which were released on 8/22/2008. Since I returned mine, I would love to hear if you have it working on Vista SP1 or better.**** Previous review ****Looked like a decent product, however.... Turns out that the drivers for VISTA are still in Beta after 1 year (last release of the driver is over a year ago). To make matters worse, it is known NOT to work with Vista SP1, as of May 2008. They don't expect to have a driver update until October. However, since the last driver update is over a year ago, I put the chances of a real driver update at near zero. Too bad, looked like a good product.Didn't work on any of my VISTA machines. Sending it back."
2,No supported by Windows XP Media Center,"No supported by Windows XP Media Center. I finally found this on the manufacturer web page. Could be nice if the warning is on Amazon so, you don't waste time ordering and returning"
1,If you want something solid - do not buy this!,"Bought one of these a while back. on my first system i was running windows xp pro, the drivers then were bad. since then I've changed to vista 64 bit operating system. big mistake m-audio has no support what so ever. in their forums they have lied to people that they would have a driver out in a couple of weeks. That was nearly over half a year ago. So their strategy is to say this every three or four weeks just to keep you on the edge of your seat. before you buy this just go to their forum on their website and search for mobilepre usb 64 bit and see for your self. stay clear of this company!"
2,Unnecessarily Complicated,"The Product was in fine working order, but for the purposes of recording speeches, it's too complicated. It seems like it's trying to be a cheap version of pro-tools, but if you want to do what pro-tools does, rather buy pro-tools. So, i don't rate the product very high."
1,M-Audio MobilePre,"I ordered this the same day I ordered a guitar from Guitar Center, If you see ""Email for availability"" on a web page you are ordering from that means its back ordered. After 20 days of waiting they sent an email stating it was going to be another 30 days. I shopped real stores and bought a beautiful Stratocaster. BUT by that time my 30 day warranty was up and the M-Audio bearly functions. The head phone jack has to be pulled out in just this special place to work; the USB connection crackles and cuts out completely sometimes. My musician friends are back in town and say Line 6 is better. No matter I'm very happy to be playing again. The delay gave me time to realize I needed good instrument that is a joy to play and I got this sweet Fender instead of the 150 buck bargain. Oh! the M-Audio was a refurbish...NO bargain"
4,Good for demos and budget home studios,"This is a great value as it can power a condenser mic as well as being a recording interface.Two gripes:First, as another reviewer pointed out, this unit is a little more noisy than advertised, with a noise floor of about -75db in my testing. This is fine for demos, but not for recording anything for a major release.Second, there seems to be some bleed-over from one channel to the other, which is fine if you're recording one channel at a time, or using both for stereo recording, but don't expect a pure channel of drums and a pure channel of guitar.However, for the money, this is a good unit, especially with its portability and preamp."
5,Much better than I expected,"I bought this hardware expecting to just make some nice tracks of myself...maybe for a demo. Some of the reviews had some negative things to say so I was very skeptical. I just expected it to be OK, but I must admit I was extremely surprised. First off, I think the software and kind of mic you use are most important when it comes to the mobilepre. The software it came with is very inadequate. I'm using CoolEditPro along with a Shure Beta58 mic, and the sound is phenomenal for personal PC recording. For the price you pay, I think this is an INCREDIBLE deal for beginner recording equipment. The sound you get is by no means studio quality, but you get 85% of studio power for 15% the price of studio equipment. Bottom line, it's great for anyone looking for simple starting pc recording hardware. A Great value.If you want a sample of what I've recorded with the mobilepre, feel free to email me and I'll send you a sample of one of my recordings."
1,too fancy!,"Way too fancy for your average BBQ fan. Unless you like goat cheese and fennel on your quale, yes thats right quale, then you will not like this book. As a matter of fact, i dont think there is one recipe that uses a good old BEEF as the main ingredient. Make the meals in this book and you will be hungry 10 minutes later. Doesn't help that the Author is from England, not much BBQing going on there! The ""encyclopedia of"" collection is fantastic but they made a mistake with this authur!"
5,Great leash....,Double Handle Leash-----Great leash for my 80lb Golden puppy....makes walking him possible.Leash seems well made and makes our walks a pleasure for both of us!.Easy shopping and shipping A+++
1,CAUTION; NOT AS PICTURED!!,"I specifically ordered this leash because of the clip style shown in the picture. I did NOT want a leash with the standard D-clip as I've had problems with those types of clips. I ordered two of these and when they arrived, they are totally different leashes from the picture-and BOTH have D-clips. NOT ACCEPTABLE."
3,Sturdy,This is a nice leash with a sturdy clip. The loop is smaller and lower than expected. It is great for a large dog but for a small or medium sized dog the loop is too low as you have to bend down to get it.
5,GREAT BIT SET,MY HUSBAND LOVED THESE BITS. HE SAID THERE WAS A BIT FOR ALMOST ANY NEED. HE SAID THEY WERE STRONG AND WORKED WELL
3,Dewalt (made in china),"This was a good deal - I got it for $13 shipped on a lightning deal. That is the only reason I bought it...not sure if it would really be worth anymore. The phillips bits seem to wear quickly and the screw sleeve just seems cheaply made. Not terrible, but I have used better stuff."
5,Bluesmagu,Have used Dewalt tools and have had excellent performance and holds true with their screwdriving set. I'm very pleased with their products.
4,Similar sets can be found @ your local Home Depot,"Dewalt quality always appears good, but I have not opened yet to try. Did find the identical item on sale @ local Home Depot."
4,DeWalt DW2163 37 Piece Screwdriving,This is a very nice set has 90% of the stuff you need the only problem I had with it was getting the tool out of the box and you cannot put it back in the slot is so tight I broke a fingernail trying to put it back into the box slot. if you are married or have girlfriend have them do it. You do not have to worry about them falling out at all very nice set.
1,TOO MUCH,I CAN PURCHASE THIS SET AT canadian tire for a lower price and this does not included the exchange.
3,technically it's not 37 pieces,"this is a great set, and it practically got to me over-night (with standard shipping). the only problems i have with this set (in no particular order) are:A) The pieces are a real pain to get in and outB) i can't fit the case in my drill case (i have a DC750KA) but that's not a real problemC) it's not really 37-piece because they give you more than one of the same bitC.1) i know this adds up to 45 that's because i went by number of heads not bits6 - SQ2 Square head1 - SQ1 Square head1 - SQ3 Square head1 - Long P2 Phillips head1 - Long SQ2 Square head3 - Double Sided P2 head3 - Double Sided Combo P2/SL8(flat-head)1 - Double Sided Combo P3/SL10(flat-head)1 - Double Sided Combo P1/SL6(flat-head)1 - P1 Phillips head10 - P2 Phillips head1 - P3 Phillips head6 - SQ2 Square head1 - SQ1 Square head1 - SQ3 Square head2 - SL8 Flat head1 - SL6 Flat head1 - SL10 Flat head3 - Magnetic drivers"
3,Just O.K.; Not Great,Impressed at first and disappointed now. In the beginning (sounds familiar) there was a really good looking set of screw bits that actually worked fairly well with light screwing. But after a few months and having to install window blinds I became disappointed with the results. I made a specific point to match the screw head with the screw bit so that the job would be easier. I additionally pre-screwed the holes to make it further easier. Then came the surprise. The screw bits did not hold the screws. That is the screw heads were stronger than the screw bit. Now that is wrong. Really wrong. If anything the screw head should be the first to go but not with these bits. Instead of leaving the job incomplete I resorted to my old (1973 vintage) Craftsman ratchet screwdriver and the original bit that came with it to finish the job. Now that's wrong.
4,Very handy,"Have only had a chance to use it on several occasions, but it has been very useful. The only drawback is the plastic bit holders sometimes are difficult to get the bits back into place."
4,A fascinating history of UK rail safety.,"For me this book works on more than one level - as a historical review of how railway safety evolved, prompting some uneasy comparisons with aviation i.e. little gets done until the body count gets high; as an insight into the world of the Victorian and Edwardian railways; and not least as an often chilling account of disaster.Rolt does seem to have the knack of adding the detail that brings a story to life. It is hard not to feel for the signalman who solemnly tells his assistant ""Go tell Mr Bence I am afraid that I have wrecked the Scotch Express""."
5,finding the truth,"moving book about the truth of life...finding the truth, letting it change you and hanging onto it forever."
3,4 stars for the beginning investor but only 2 for the experienced,"This book provides a 30-40 page critique of the major investment ""strategies"". These include those surrounding dividends, PE ratios, book values, stabel earnings and well ""managed"" companies, among others. The book is written in simple language that any layman can understand is geared towards that audience. It provides not only an overview of the strategy but the risks involved, discussion of investment timespan relevant to strategy, strengths and weaknesses, and, possibly most importantly, historical data on how the stragegy has performed.If one is an experienced invester one has probably, however, has seen all of this before and in much greater detail (probably having absorbed the eequivalent of an easy book on each). Hence for this group of investors the book would provide little additional knowledge."
4,A must to read for every investors,"In each chapter, Damodaran checks a different investing method. From low P/E to growth passing to great companies and arbitrage. He reviews 14 different investing strategies.Each of his reviews check both the advantages and risks of each method before proposing an investment method or screen. The logic is very clear and can be adapted you investment strategies and ideas.This book is absolutely fantastic and I think it is a must to read for anyone who is an investor or wish to become one.The only negative point is with the kindle version. It comes without chapter and menu, so it is harder to read on a kindle."
4,An oasis of peace on hectic days,"A.M. Yoga provides a peaceful and relaxing routine to start your day. The beautiful setting, soothing narration, and quiet music enhance relaxation while the gentle movements and stretches limber the body. Most of this easy routine involves seated or supine positions, with nothing more ""strenuous"" than the downward dog pose and supine hamstring stretch, so if you are looking for a more advanced morning yoga program, you would be happier with a different video. Also, be aware that you will spend only 12 minutes actually moving, with the other five divided between conscious relaxation and guided meditation (the video clocked in at 17 minutes rather than the 20 claimed in advertising). This brevity is perfect for busy schedules, but an extended version for those of us with more time would have been a worthwhile addition. Finally, although the title says ""A.M.,"" this video would be appropriate any time of the day you need to relax."
4,AM Yoga a real joy,"This am yoga tape, starring Rodney Yee, is a real joy. It is very easy to follow for a beginner. It makes you feel peaceful and focused. I bought both the am and pm yoga tapes, but find that I only use the am tape - even at night. It is good for relaxation anytime. I found some of the poses on the pm tape a bit challenging, but still reasonable for a beginner. My one complaint about this tape (and reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is that there is not enough time for relaxed meditation afterwards. I wish there were more music and ocean waves to meditate to instead of Yoga Journal commercials."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"For someone who's never done yoga - especially never with a yoga instructor - it's probably an ok video. However, if you have been taking classes you will be disappointed. He whips through the poses much too quickly - by the time I felt I was in the pose properly he was two poses ahead of me. He does not explain how to properly position yourself in the pose, just sort of glosses over what the pose looks like. I've taken a seminar from from Rodney Yee before, and this video is nothing like what he teaches in a classroom environment."
1,Way too boring and simple,"""Beginner"" is an understatement for this video. I was still in REM when I finished it. The scenery is beautiful, that's all I can say about it. It shows you how to sit quietly with your legs crossed. Who needs a video for that? And it gives ridiculously simple moves that my deceased grandmother could muster, bless her soul, I love her deeply! I wanted to give this to my mother to introduce her to yoga, but it would turn her off because it is so simplistic and boring."
4,Great to do before breakfast,"I'm a real yoga novice, but I've been using this video (Rodney Yee, A.M. Yoga) to wake up to for the past 2 months. I plan my schedule to allow time for this yoga practice, I truly love the scenery (since the ocean is one of my favorite places to be, this video has instant appeal for me), and I am easily able to focus and relax into the yoga practice this video provides. The only pose I don't like is downward dog, so I simply skip over it. I like the Rodney Yee video much better than the Patricia Walden companion video. I definitely recommend this to other beginners."
4,Loved It!,"I've been doing this tape three times a week for the past three weeks and have thoroughly enjoyed it. Beautifully filmed with clear, easy-to-follow instructions and a fun, well-thought-out routine."
4,Great morning kink remover.,"This is a very basic, easy program that really rids you of the stiff muscles and joints you acquire during the night. It is a worthwhile 20 minutes out of you otherwise busy morning."
4,If you hate waking up -- this will help,Very gentle awakening but at the end you feel ready to 1) do more exercise; 2) face the day energized.
4,Great way to start the day,"This tape is a wonderful way to start off the day. It's very short so can be done before getting ready to go to work. Just enough stretching to get out the kinks. Also, Rodney's body is easy on the eyes!"
3,"Barebones, but nice for the price","I recently found myself in a position where I needed a handheld calculator with just basic functions. This one fit the bill and deid satisfy my need.Remember though, that this is a barebones calculator. Even the square root function is not on the keyboard. The USB function is cute but has a very limited use."
2,Laser sight,"I would've given this product a higher rating had it not been for the weak batteries that came in the package and the feeble plastic weaver rail bracket, this product should've been priced lower for those reasons mentioned."
1,Not even close,"Don't get this. It absolutely sucks. The laser is too fragile and it broke in the 2nd day.Batteries burn out too quick, and laser point isnt that powerfull"
1,If you like throwing money away...,"broke after 5 minutes, the buttom on the cord just stoped working, i bought another one and laser works SOMETIMES and isnt very bright at all, barley goes 20 feet. I feel stupid for even buying a second one."
1,garbage,"I bought this not expecting much out of a $9 sight but trust me it is complete garbage. The first one i recieved just plain didnt work at all, didnt turn on. Then seller sent me a new one which came in two days. second one worked on and off but i dealt with it. When it came down to sighting it in was another story. No matter how i adjusted it, the sight was atleast 3 1/2 feet off in any direction. The seller was great but the product was worthless. save the $9 and the headache."
2,Dated,Too much fluff. Typeface is very small and hard to read. Pictures have a yellowish cast and the room scenes look dated.
2,Ok but not worth price,"For being a bit pricey, this little travel alarm did not have a very usable backlight. At night it didn't light up the entire screen making it difficult to read. It also was made a little cheaper then expected. One night I dropped it and the screen completely shattered rendering it useless."
2,Great LCD TV but mine has a Backlight Bleeding Problem,"If you are considering buying this TV because of its Cable Card Slot,don't. I have had my cable company change 2 cable cards already and I am still having problems. My Tv came with a ""backlight bleeding problem"". If you don't know what this problem is, just Google it. It will be worth your time as this problem is very commom among LCDs. I had the worst experience with Toshiba customer service and two of its repair centers. They will not acknoledge the problem and will not fix it. I have sent them several letters which went answered. It is really sad when a company like Toshiba treats its repeat customers like that!"
2,Nice display but too many problems,"I've had several problems with this television since I purchased it in 2007. Shortly after purchase, the HDMI board went out. It was under warranty but it took four visits for the repair service to get the correct part from Toshiba. Now, after twenty-two months, it has developed several vertical lines across the screen, one in the middle and one down each side about a third of the way in. While not overly intrusive in dark scenes, once you know the lines are there you can't NOT see them, especially when a scene pans horizontally. Of course this happened shortly after the warranty expired. Luckily I bought this with my SIGNATURE VISA which doubled Toshiba's warranty. The service technician diagnosed the panel (for a $95.00 service call) as needing to be replaced at a total cost of over $2000.00. Heck, I only paid $1700.00 for the TV to begin with. Looks like VISA will be reimbursing me my original purchase price. You can be sure I will NOT be buying a Toshiba."
5,Highly Regarded,Brian Hall's book is exceptional. I would recommend this title to Adults and teenagers 13-14 years and up.
3,To Long For What You Get,"With a book of this length (380 pages) you would think you were getting a truly wonderful tale. But, no. The Saskiad is an interesting story of a girl with more issues to deal with than friends. Where the story could open up and keep you interested, it closes and opens a new door. This style of writing I find painful."
4,Quite a surprise,"I have to admit I have been not a huge fan of Cash but really wanted to see what all the hoopla was about. I knew I liked a few of his songs, but that is about it. I wanted to know more about him before I see the movie that is out. This book was very interesting. I liked how it jumped around in his life. You never know what famous people are really going through."
3,I have not read yet,"I have not read yet, but I think I will like it immensely.I like to know about the life of my idols, and Johnny Cash is one of them."
5,Meet Johnny Cash,"What a fantastic book! Being a Johnny Cash fan all my life I wanted to read about his life, and, when I read it, I thought he was talking straight to me. He is really a great storyteller, he is straight and to the point, basically just tells you about his life, everything that made him who he was. He does't leave anything out. He tells about the good times on tour and at his childhood, and in the dark times with drug addictions. He really is good, so if your a Cash fan, and you want to learn more about him, Cash is the book to read."
4,Voice of Cash,"Mr. Cash's autobiography was a gold mine of anecdotes and memories, and no doubt his family treasure this book immensely. The conversational style really suited this legendary man, musician, vocalist and songwriter.The only thing I would say in the negative is that for this reader, it was not all that interesting or relevant to read the details about each of his children and grandchildren. I'm sure they themselves love having his memories of them in print, but that section just lost my interest."
5,Amazing read!,This is seriously the favorite autobiography of anyone I've ever read. It reads more like Johnny Cash is sitting with you just randomly telling you stories thru his life. It's very friendly & comforting in a way. I would seriously recommend to fans and non fans...such a good read all around!
2,Sing it don't write it!,"Don't get me wrong, I love Johnny Cash's music, especially that album where he helped all those prisoners - many of them murderers - escape from the Hell of their daily routines. But this is yet another book that proves the old adage that musicians should stick to music and leave writing to the writers and autobiographing to the autobiographers. It's an interesting story, but Johnny's already told that story much better through his songs and stage shows."
5,cash review,"the book arrived in a good amount of time, within just a couple of days, its in very good condition. a very reliable seller."
5,Purchased as a gift.,"I bought this book for a huge Johnny Cash fan. He really enjoyed getting the ""Johnny"" story from Johnny Cash's point of view. My friend is far from a historian, but he loved the book and has often compared it to other Johnny Cash biographies as being far superior. A must read for a Cash fan."
4,Good autobiography about a great Musician,This book was good. I can't say it any simpler. I enjoyed reading it and feel a little closer to the man whose music I admire.
5,Ejoyable Read!,"I truly enjoyed this book. Mr. Cash has a way with words. He welcomes you into his life as if you were a treasured friend. This isn't just about his career, but about him as a person, his thoughts and views. He talks about his home life before he became a star. He talks about his lifetime friends, Roy Orbison, and Bob Dylan to name a few. He takes you home to Cinnamon Hill, a sugar plantation built in 1700's with stories of how he came to own it, his home invasion, and a few ghost stories too. He takes to the White House and his meeting with each President.Mr. Cash bears his soul in this book, with his sense of humility, his spirituality and his love for June. I believe that fan's of the Man in Black won't be disappointed. They'll see a side of the man that perhaps they hadn't known."
4,Very conversational account by the Man in Black,"Not a great piece of writing (hence 4 stars), but it is as if, as another reviewer has said, the story told over a cup of coffee. I felt like it was a candid humble account of the man's life. I thought he accepted responsibility for his many flaws and shared alot about what was important to him. For instance, his faith is clearly integral to his values. Very quick and good read."
5,Ramblings of a Ramblin' Man,"The chapters of this book do form a simple sort of outline, but that outline is loose. More likely it appears that someone gave Johnny Cash a dictating machine and asked him to record his memories as he traveled. From one location to another he records events from his life. The years and subjects meld together with little discernable order. The style of language is like a conversation.But it works. I thought the book started a little slow, but then I grew accustomed to the style. Having read the book I felt I had a deeper understanding of the life of Johnny Cash, the backstage lives of country music stars, and, more importantly, a greater appreciation for my own life. After reading the book I realized that I wouldn't trade my life for his for anything.I gave the book 5 stars because I have a feeling that it will stay with me a long time. There is something deep and tragic about this story."
5,"Hello, this is Johnny Cash","Pull up a comfortable chair and hot cup of java and spend a few hours listening to the man himself tell you about various aspects of his life. Funny, sad and frightening it's all here. You will get to know a J. R. and his life on an intimate level far beyond the songs he wrote.It's an excellent read."
5,SUPERB!,"I was looking for something with some real meat to it, and I found it. This is an excellent read. You get a feel not just for Cash's biographical travels, but the man's soul. A worthy testament to a great American, a humble Christian and a musical pioneer."
