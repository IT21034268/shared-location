4,Naughty But Nice,The ladies of Somebody Holla! Book Club kept me rolling with laughter. Each lady had a story of their own to tell. They laughed and cried together. Small Packages had a very unique storyline. I had never read a book that was a story within a story. Sydney took romance/erotica to another level.Review given by Vanessa
2,Not Feeling,"This book was a boring read. I did not like the way the book was set up where the story had to stop for the book club's discussion, I would have preferred to keep reading the story to get it over with. The best part of reading this book were the steamy sexy acts."
1,order it for the rebirth only,ok so weve got three films 2 were insainly cheese tastic and then theres the rebirth GET IT FOR THE REBIRTH good old school horror movie u wont be dissapointed its set in a castle and people die off one by one til they tell you whos the killer and you'll feel stupid cause you weren't using your brain you were thinking it was the obvious so watch HOWLING the rebirth and enjoy !
2,compact but only has15 mile reception,"The product said it would receive station up to 50 miles. The number of stations I got in the Pleasanton area was 5, 2 were HD. At the Sacramento area, I got 9. All were within 15 miles. It is compact, it can be used indoors or mounted in the attic. It is pretty easy to set up with good mounting brackets and adjustments. I have not tried any other antennas so I don't know how it compares with other antennas. I asked my neighbor who has a large fishbone style antenna, their reception was no better. This product is ok depending on where you live and how many stations you have within 15 miles. You do get free over the air regular and HD T.V channels. It is small enough to take with you to have something to watch while camping. This antenna does work, just check with Antenna web first and lower your expectations."
5,Great Product,This is a great product. I haven't even mounted it outside...it's just sitting in my living room on the floor and I'm already getting all the channels that i was hoping to get. I am optimistic that when I put it outside I will pull in even more channels from over 50 miles away!!
4,Much better than expected,"Being 35 miles from the TV main station antennas I was not expecting much in the way of a signal. To my surprise the HD stations come in crisp and clear with no break up. The non-digital stations are poor though. So now instead of paying $60 a month to have 200 satellite channels and nothing on I get 6 channels and nothing to watch but at least it's free. Ok, there's one or two things I miss about the satellite set up but I don't miss them $60 a month worth.Also, the Terk unit is lighter weight than it looks and the hardware appears to be the same as the hardware that held my old satellite dish. I was even able to scavenge some hardware from the old dish installation to help me with an awkward mounting situation on the roof. I'm not sure about the long term durability of the plastic part in the Arizona sun or if the metal mount will be strong enough (being high on the roof) when the thunderstorms blow in but so far so good."
3,Hard to Tell,It's in use and it works but according to the Dish guys I could have saved a few bucks and purchased something less fancy looking and got the same reception.
2,I get better reception with rabbit ears,"Not much to say. After the hassle of installing this, I'm back to using indoor rabbit ears. I get better reception with a simple pair of cheap rabbit ears than with this device. This antenna was certainly no magic bullet."
1,Pain to align,This antenna took hours to align and then a windy day came up 2 weeks later and I lost every channel even though it was secure on my roof. Now I have only 2 digital channels in LA where I was getting 7. Very disappointing. I have one apartment complex that's 2 stories in the way. But no high rises anywhere around. The documentation for this product was thin. I would not recommend this antenna for HD reception unless you are willing to hire a professional installer which I am now deliberating.
3,Best Antenna I have tried.,"I tried a few cheap antennas from box stores. No good. This works the best, but still with dtv, rain fade, wind fade, similar to satellite. I do have inside in window sill. In summer will move outside. Maybe better then."
2,Inadequate,"Worked poorly for me. I live about 15 miles from the transmitter(s). No channel was received properly (i.e., without significant drop out). Gave up and bought a Channel Master CM4228 8 bay UHF antenna. This worked great in my attic. Don't waste your money, get a real antenna."
3,Terk HD Antenna OK!,"Shipping excellent. Pricing excellent...much cheaper than buying at Circuit City. Easy to install...took less than an hour. Reception OK...loses signal from time to time for no apparent reason, but quickly signal returns. Overall, satisfied. I use with my Dish Network DVR/HD box."
2,"Poor contruction, incremental signal benefit over indoor antenna","I installed this antenna in the fall. I hooked it up and walked around the house with it to find the best spot. The best spot gave me better reception than my powered bunny ears, but only by a little. One major channel still didn't always come in.Over the winter, the top part of the plastic cover popped off. This created a trap for water and ice as the bottom part hinged outwards. By the spring, the whole cover had fallen off. Reception is a tiny bit better without the cover, and friends say it looks cool to see the actual antenna, but I don't know if it's going to survive another winter. It's too high to re-attach.The other thing I'm not super happy about is the size of this Antenna. It's a lot bigger than the picture and a name like ""slim"" would suggest. I suppose the dimensions are available, so you can see for yourself."
2,"Good UHF, terrible VHF","The UHF reception with this antenna is excellent, but I get better low end VHF from a set of radio shack rabbit ears."
5,Worth the Money,"I love this Antenna! I used it on my new LCD and I am receiving more digital channels plus all my regular network channel that I did not clearly receive on my analog t.v. It's suppose to be an outdoor, but I simply placed it against my window facing South and it's doing great. It will probably do better if I take the time to install in outside near the roof. With the money you save from not subscribing to a service, it quickly pays off for itself in 3-4 months."
5,works indoors,"I tried the cheap tv top. didn't work, maybe got 1 channel badly.this works indoors getting about 6 channelsI'm sure would be better the higher and if outdoors"
1,Didn't Work Out,"Unfortunately, both of these tapes were defective, and all they had was snow.And that's too bad, because I was looking forward to having at least a few installments of ""The Life Of Riley,"" and William Bendix was definitely a hoot in the role."
3,nice item for the money.,"Its a nice product,very easy to assemble. You get what you pay for so don't expect an expensive look.Quality of wood is so-so, put a runner on it and you have a small table where you may need one without it costing too much."
4,Glad I got it,"I got this because I figured it would be a reference for the dvds I got, but it turns out that the dvds have their own songbook/reference and this was additional information. I'm glad I got it, it explains how to simply cords to your level, or how to switch things around while you are growing in skill. It also has some advice in the back about learning music while listening to records. I figure this will be nice when I'm more advanced, though I imagine it's probably similar to other books out there (can't say for sure though, still very new at this)."
4,Wonderful Photographs from Charles Anderson Farrell,"Photo illustrations feature the Garner family from the Goshen community (south of Greensboro and from possibly from within Greensboro, the Goins family. In the images African Americans are shown in a rural agrarian background during the 1930s.In the story, Tobe and his siblings are shown working on a family farm. The text is written for beginning readers. It is the photos that really make this is a book worth having. They are well done with a good eye to composition and capture well a moment in time; a look at North Carolina at the end of The Great Depression.Farrell (b 1894 - d 1977), a native of Yadkin County North Carolina, was a photographer for the Greensboro Daily News and had a studio/art and camera store called The Art Shop."
2,good intentions,"Black and Decker had a great idea but has not gone far enough to perfect it. The driver bits, of course, are made poorly and are very difficult to find..just try to find one. The quality is horrible as I broke two phillips head drivers while replacing a small deck on my house (24x8). I've had phillips bits strip before but I've never had them break off until using this tool. It does jam pretty easily and is a pain to reload. With some work and carbide tiped drivers it could be a winner instead of a looser. Too bad black and decker did not follow thru with some quality control to make their good intentions work."
4,Good resource if you already know the basics.,Good resource. I like this even if there is a way to get this same information online. I like the cookbooks and the nutshell books.
3,"""falling in love one laugh at a time""--really?","This is the sub-heading under the Fipside banner, and the other reviewer found the story entertaining. I did not. I expected a romp. This wasn't it. I enjoyed another Flipside, Without a Clue by Trish Jensen, but I was disappointed here. I relied on the other review to purchase the book and I wish I hadn't. It still gets three stars because it was decently written, with mild Chicago cops and lawyers intrigue."
4,"Good Book, Wish It Went Quicker","I thought this book was great until the end, the storyline was drawn out just a tad too much, but if you don't mind skipping large descriptive paragraphs, you'll enjoy this book very much, I did. I was a little concerned about the relationship between Zach and Adria, but the end eased those concerns. This book kept me guessing throughout and doubting my thoughts of who was behind the whole kidnapping....Enjoy!"
2,Kind of creepy,"I like most Lisa Jackson books. I agree with someone else's comment about there being a lot of back and forth in the timeline but what really bothered me the most was the relationship between Adria and Zach. Yes, we all know she wouldn't write it if they were really brother and sister but still it's almost to creepy to read at times. It usually takes me less than a day to read a book this size but this book took me almost a week to get through because it didn't keep my interest or I would get creeped out. Maybe it's just me, even knowing they weren't blood relation but still thought they were was weird enough for me."
5,Excellent Read,"If you enjoy suspense and if you love Lisa Jackson books, you will love She How She Dies. I have read and collected all of Lisa's books...she never lets her readers down. An amazing read, excellent story and well written. Brilliant"
3,An okay mystery but not a great romance,"This is the first book of Lisa Jackson's that I have read. I thought the mystery surrounding the main character was good, but the romance that was thrown in was a little off. I figured it out about halfway through the book. I might read another book by Lisa Jackson, but not right away."
1,Disgusting,"The incestuous undertones were more than I could bear. Even if all is worked out in the end, it's still gross and I don't intend to find out."
3,Lisa Jackson is always great read,Another great book by Lisa Jackson. Can't go wrong reading anything by her. Have read most of her books. Love it
4,Another Good Read From Lisa Jackson,I have read several of Lisa Jackson's books and they all move you right along through the plot. I would recommend any of her books.
3,A Little Too Predictable...,"The romance side of the book was odd - it was easy to assume the author wouldn't write a novel about an incestuous relationship so I was ready for it to ""unfold"". I had the WHO-DUN-IT part figured out about halfway through. It was a long novel that probably could have been wrapped up in fewer pages. I'm a huge fan of Lisa Jackson & if you are too (& you have a lot of time on your hands because it's so darn long & drawn out), give it a whirl."
4,Cold kills,Great light picks. They take a licking and keep on playing. The only thing that does effect these picks is using them in cold weather. I play in the streets here and there and these have only failed when it is too cold for me to be out there playing.
3,Theoretically good but impossible to inflate,"If you order this, make sure you have very, very strong lungs and incredibly fast reflexes. You'll need both to inflate the ball against the pressure of the plastic from which it is made and then, as fast as the speed of sound, remove the plastic straw from the 1/4"" hole you use to inflate and and stick in an inch long plug. Good luck with all of that- maybe the exercise you get with this ridiculous arrangement is how the ball improves your conditioning."
2,Far too preachy...,"Ultimately the message within this novel is.... ""maintain the status quo... don't try to change things too much""... Arren's judgment of Ged is perfectly accurate... The things he says seem deep at first but ultimately he's saying nothing at all.The ""villain"" breaks the cycle of life and death... and eliminates death, and removes magic from the world... So what? The reader is automatically supposed to accept that this is a ""bad"" thing... I'm not so sure why. In buddhism the goal is to eliminate the cycle of birth and death... so it isn't obvious to me that this villain was actually a villain at all..."
1,One Word-BORING!!!!,This is the most boring book I ever read. I wold rather stare at a box of Corn Flakes than read this book.
5,Third time around,"This is the third time around I have read this series. First in highschool (1980s) by reading this book, and then found out there were two in the series before it.This series is one of my 'must have' books now that I own a Kindle.Can't say enough good things and have no bad review to offer. Buy the series and enjoy."
5,The best yet,"I have loved all of Earthsea as I've read it, but this volume resonated with me most dearly. Its themes are perhaps native to my own outlook. I definitely recommend the series as a whole and am looking forward to the next volume."
4,A fitting conclusion.,"The Farthest Shore tells the story of how Sparrowhawk, now Archmage, travels with Arran to the absolute end of the world and beyond to defeat a wizard who thinks he has conquered death and in so doing has opened the door to death so that all life and magic are draining out of the world. People have forgotten wizardry and are obsessed with immortality. Woven into the tale of their quest is the idea that the Balance must be preserved and that life and death are just two sides of the same coin. A very fitting and enjoyable end to the Earthsea trilogy, and the tale of the life of Sparrowhawk."
2,"disappointing, not as good as the first book","i found this book disappointing. actually, A Wizard of Earthsea was a great book, but all of the sequels were slow moving and meandering. they take place in a setting with much potential, but they do not live up to it."
2,Blah,"This book was, in my opinion, a low point in the Earthsea Trilogy. Arren made for a poor companion to Sparrowhawk, and his character was far too underdeveloped to add any interest to the book. There was an underlying sense of dourness throughout the whole of the material, and I just kept wanting to get it over with. If you want to enjoy the Earthsea Cycle to it's fullest, skip straight to ""Tehanu""."
4,Refreshing and succinct,"In a genre dominated by 800+ page tomes, this book was a refreshing and delightful read. Ursula Le Guin is a master of flowing, lyrical prose. The book is relatively brief, but chock full of all the elements that are required for a great fantasy story. She accomplishes this feat by keeping things simple and uncluttered. She doesn't need an appendix to list all the characters and their relation to one another. Her world is well-realized, her characters well-fleshed out, and the story captures you from the first pages. Take a break from the massive tales of Jordan and Martin et al. (not that there's anything wrong with them) and read an author whose writing is as magical as her story."
4,An excellent little novel.,"This is a book far more interested in telling a deep story of the human condition and facing life and death and growing up and growing old than it is in telling a rollicking good Fantasy novel, and it benefits from this enormously. Although I liked A Wizard of Earthsea more, The Farthest shore is quite likely the more significant story for what it deals with.I've read it twice, and felt it was worth the money."
4,As good as the,"Ursula Le Guin wrote this very well.It was extremely interesting ,and very absorbing .The plot is straightforward,andthe characters are wonderful .Despite all this , I must admit that it is slightly confusing ,and I had to interpret a bit for myself ,but I still loved it ."
3,Good read...not transcendent,"'..Shore' is a simple read. It's not a complex book. It doesn't seem to have a deeper meaning. It's just a story about a guy trying to save the world. As such, it's not that interesting. It takes all the reader's energy to stay focused during the interminable paragraphs.The only part I truly enjoyed about this book was Le Guin's depiction of the dragons. They came alive. A few sentences of description and I could actually picture them."
3,"A nice story, but not very enthralling.","This is the third volume in the Earthsea quartet (following A Wizard of Earthsea and The Tombs of Atuan, and followed by Tehanu).The Farthest Shore, set some fifteen or twenty years after the events of The Tombs of Atuan, tells the story of Ged, now an Archmage, and Arren, a young prince, and their voyage around the world of Earthsea in search of the Unmaker, who is responsible for the disappearence of magic and of the balance of the world.Compared to The Tombs of Atuan, I found this third part rather disapointing and lacking in action. Ged and Arren are just travelling from one island to the next, and nothing really happens. The evolution of their friendship is interesting, though, and that's what kept me reading. But as a whole, I found the series rather boring, although well written if you like old-fashioned style, and will only read Tehanu for the sake of it."
4,"I DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK. . ., BUT","I didn't like this book. I guess that's why I read it all in one night, cried, laughed and rated it 4 STARS. Go figure. This was my first book by Ms. Chance and it won't be my last. FALL FROM GRACE was definitely NOT your typical romance western. It was a gritty, hard, interesting story with gritty, hard and interesting characters. No easy choices here. No glamor. No pat, happy ending. What you do have is a good story."
3,Good Read Bad Ending,"This is the first book I have read from Megan Chance and I had to say I did like the story line of this book, but I could not understand the ending of this book. I think that more should had been said in order to make it more of a better ending; other then that I enjoyed this book and I look forward to reading other books by Megan Chance."
3,Good story but where is the romance??,"This book disappointed me - although Lily and Texas are well-written characters they failed to evoke any real sense of romance for me. The realism of the story left me longing for some ""spark"" between the two that never really happened. For me, this story is big on Western and Historical and short on Romance."
5,Excellent!,"Megan Chance has done it again with another incredible story. Texas and Lily were wonderfully original characters, and the story very well written. I didn't want it to end."
3,"Inspiring, but sketchy on the details","A nice vision, and not a new one, but is it practical and realistic? I don't know but I think that fuel made from yeast or algae fed from CO2 from fossil fuel plants can close the carbon cycle and may be much easier to implement within today's infrastructure...but I just flip burgers what do I know? The one big gripe I have with this book is that it doesn't describe the pitfalls of hydrogen, the technical breakthroughs that are required (and the likelihood of success), and what other competitors may be out there that can make hydrogen never get off the ground (yes I know it's lighter than air but can you say greenhouse gas?)."
5,Well worth the reading,"The Pathways to a Radiant Self book is a great tool for anyone who wants to know themselves at a deep level. Kathy Pike helps the average person understand the power of the seven energy centers (or chakras) and how to put these resources into action for their well being. She not only helps the reader understand where each energy center is and how it manifests itself, she provides a variety of tools that the reader can use for their own emotional and physical healing. The reader has assessments to measure how their energy is currently around each of the chakras, meditaions for aligning that energy and journal work for continuing their growth and awareness. It is a very user-friendly book that I find myself exploring over and over again."
3,Whats A Christian to do with Harry Potter?,"Connie Neal received my respect when she treated others with respect even though she disagreed with their opinion. For me, that is almost the most important part of her contribution to this issue. Others seem to be in a screaming match ever ready to tear the other person down when they disagree. With that as a comparison, I am ready to believe Connie Neal over the other ""side"". Her experience of using the books as a catalyst for construction conversation(chap 11)seems like a very positive way to treat this issue."
5,"They are MERELY books, people","To the person who wrote that God is not real....keep that opinion to yourself - I think you may have Him confused with Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny....To those who belittle the Harry Potter series and JK Rowling: These are MERELY books for entertainment purposes. Do you people NOT remember stories, imagination, make believe? Are you so out of touch with the wonderment of your youth that you actually believe a book series about a good natured boy and his good natured friends fighting against evil could be a BAD THING???? Its all in play....its called creativity. I read all of this dribble and it reminds me of another book: Fahrenheit 451...a tale in which ALL books are banned and burned because SOMEONE might be offended by a story. I'm sorry, but let's get on with what is seriously wrong in the world."
5,You get to make up your own mind!?!,"Can you believe it. Finally a Christian perspective on Harry Potter that gives the reader factual information on why they should or should not read the books with their children. She also talks about how to use Harry Potter to minister to your own children and others. It's wonderful to read. I appreciate her open mind, and her willingness to say that it's silly to argue."
3,A different look,"I am a big Harry Potter fan, I have all 4 books and the two small ones, honestly, I was totally against those people who were against Harry Potter and J.K. Rowling because of the ""satanism"" within them. After reading Neal's book my perspective about the people agaisnt HP changed. This book shows, explains and describes the different points of view of some of the christians against Potter. She makes an even comprarisson, although, it's clear that she is against HP books, but she tries to make people understand why are there persons who are against Harry. Afer reading the book I now know that there are people with different ideals and principles and like me, they have to defend them. Personally I don't find anything satanic or anything against God in those books, I love them and I can't wait to The Order of the Phoenix."
3,Balance,"The Harry Potter series is about -- among other things -- the choice between good and evil. It is not about Christianity. If you already are sure that Harry is not for your kids because a central theme of the book is witchcraft and wizardry, this book is worthless to you, as it is a balanced argument of pro and con and you don't want to hear pro. If you are curious as to where Potter fits in the spectrum of theology and want to explain to your kids, this book gives you knowledge."
1,Biblical??-NOT,"It is nothing short of grievious to see so many reviewers claiming that Connie Neal presents a biblical picture of the Harry Potter controversy. Far from it, Neal takes biblical passages out of context and mis-applies them in such a way as to soften any biblical mandates regarding avoidance if occult materials. She completely perverts Romans 14, which discusses freedoms in Christ, which is NOT applicable to issues like occultism that God has made definitive statements on (see Deut. 18). Neal has gone out on a limb by writing about issues with which she is unfamiliar. Some of Neal's OTHER works, however, are great."
1,"Just face it, the books like this one are useless...","What is all the fuss about? This book is just another in a long line of people making money off of the Harry Potter books, with out the slightest bit of work on their own. God is fake, there is no god, so there is no reason to have a problem with the Potter books in the first place. For the real truth, See books like the ones from David Icke. Do the historical work yourself, and admit, there is no ""god"", just science, and then go and enjoy the Real works worth reading, like the wonderful Harry Potter books."
5,Great case,I got this to carry my cigarettes while boating and traveling. Worked like a charm. Kept my hand rolled nice and undamaged.
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"Ever since I saw this on VHS, I have enjoyed it. The innocence of the story mixes with the bile of the Judge ... the Father who never forgives. Jeff Daniels is in so many ways an everyman. And he conveys that fragility, toughness, and caring all in the one character.The FX are minimal, the script is excellent, and the film is great. I hesitate to say that it is a family film, but with no swearing, no gratuitous gore, it would satisfy anyone who wants to protect children from that, but also provide a great Sci-Fi film to watch. Also, for anyone who cares little about that, its simply a fun film.Great Justice element too. As hard done by as Jeff Daniels character is in the film, the Judge gets his due, and some parts are very heart warming.Totally Worthwhile."
3,Not what I hoped for!!,"As a certifiable make-up junkie, I am always interested when new books about Cosmetics come out. As an African-American female, I especially am interested in ones that cater specifically to me. I have to say I was dissappointed in this book. I was hoping to see more makeovers with specific how to information. This book dealt more with Mr. Wells interaction with certain celebraties than it did with makeup techniques and looks. There were really only 3 makeovers in the book, one for light complected women, medium complected women and dark skinned complected women. There were no day versus evening looks or how tos in regards to changing or updating looks.There were also more drawings than there were actual pictures so I did not find this book to be all that helpful.I think Mr. Wells is definitely a very talented makeup artist, I have seen his work in numerous magazines, however, this book just did not give me what I was looking for."
3,Porfolio,"I am happy for Mr. Wells success. However, this book is basically a portfolio of his work. There are over 100 pages of who he worked on and the book has only a few pages for 'how-tos'."
2,Look elsewhere for a how-to manual,"I wouldn't consider this an instructional book. It gives a little bit of Reggie's history, how he became a makeup artist and lists some of the celebrities that he's worked with. His passion for his work comes through clearly but he doesn't give much instruction on face painting. Not a lot of how-to information. Perhaps its also dated. I'd love it if he came up with an instruction manual. He does a wonderful job with Oprah's face."
5,Nostalgic,"I grew up listening to this music, and I now realize, this was aimed at lovelorn/lovesick young women, any guy was a fool not to dedicate any of the songs this group sang to his girl, it said things to her that he couldn't say quite so effectibly,it brings back memories, some bittersweet, but that is part of growing up."
2,Not the item as described,"The doll came and it was not Paul as described, had to return it but had no problem with that, thankfully."
5,Learn to work harder on yourself than you do on your job.,"""If you work hard on your job, you make a living. If you work harder on yourself, you can make a fortune."" His message is simple and straight forward. I listen to this audio tape over and over and over again. I thoroughly recommended it if you want to make a difference in your life; the difference between running in the #1 track lane or being a spectator."
4,The Art of Exceptional Living,I agree with the concepts of personal responsiblity he preaches and his outline/suggestions of achieving success. And I like the the CD format that I can be played again once in while to reenforce it -- like while driving in the car.
4,Simple Yet Profound!,"It's no wonder why so many of the modern-day self-help greats credit Jim Rohn as one of their mentors. His style is straightforward and his approach is simple. However, his message packs a punch and can be life altering should you choose to take action on it.This is my first exposure to Jim Rohn and if his other teachings are anything like this one, it certainly won't be my last.This book contains a handful of simple yet profound concepts that if you just apply a few of them, the possibilities are endless. This book just opened my eyes to the fact that it doesn't have to be some complicated secret solution to move mountains so to speak in my life. It's simply just taking steady, small steps towards improving the ordinary things in my life that will make the difference I've been looking for. WOW, what a concept!"
5,Simple Truths - Exceptional Advice!,A great friend shared this CD set with me. I kept his copy and and bought him another. Jim Rohn speaks simple truths. The beauty of Jim's thoughts and suggestions is they are so wonderfully obvious to bettering one's self. The advice is indisputable. Jim has an endearing way to share very very important lessons. Concise and understandable - I am making habits of these words. Thanks Jim. Thanks Ed.
3,"Good stuff, just like every other motivational book","Basically your attitude determines your altitude. Learn everything you can. Nothing new, but nothing bad. As someone else said it gets a little repetitive. Not a bad way to kill a drive. Much better than ""The Secret""."
5,Jim Rohn at his Best!!,Great to be able to listen to Jim Rohn speak about his philosophy. Excellent CD's.
3,was interesting,"The audio of this book was very interesting. I learn much of these concepts years ago, but was nice to hear from a different view."
3,The author needs speaking lessons,I couldn't believe the voice on this audio cassette. I am not fussy -- but a pseudo-Bostonian whiny obnoxious voice is what you get on this cassette. It distracts from the messages. There are some good bits and pieces of advice seeded in a lot of filler and an over-hyped introduction. The technical qualities of the editing also left much to be desired. Tape consisted of obviously spliced segments -- and ended abruptly.
4,Great introduction to Jim Rohn,"This work was my first foray into the world of Jim Rohn. I decided to check him out after learning that Anthony Robbins cut his teeth in Rohn's seminar business.The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is because this really is more of an introductory taste of the ""You control your destiny"" kind of work. It looks like his other works are more specific. This would be a great gift for someone who has never checked out a self-help book or audiotape, and I believe it would especially appeal to the younger set (20's & 30's).I had no idea what to expect regarding Rohn's delivery style, and I must say he's a delight to listen to. His voice has an unusual cadence that makes listening to him particularly fun.I plan on checking out Rohn's other works soon."
5,"BEST TAPE SET, PERIOD!","Not sure who the one star rater is but I can be he is ""broke and embarrassed"" listening to Tony Robbins but not Jim Rohn. Repetition is the root of all true learning. I will agree that Brian Tracy ranks right up there with the best but Tony is a waste of time and money. Jim Rohn not only tells you to start a library, he recommends the books to start with. My advice to Mister one star, get a job at Mcdonalds and whistle while you wear the hat, you may make $6/hr. I have over 200 tape series in my corporate library and I clearly rank this as one of the best."
5,Makes you write things down...,I recommend this book to people willing to change their lives for the better. Because you want and need to and not because you have to.
4,Straight talk motivation,"Jim Rohn, a well-known motivational speaker and author, believes that you don't have to do exceptional things at all. Just do ordinary things exceptionally well. Rohn teaches you how to get beyond personal setbacks to begin living according to our own rules. This tape series includes sections on: Four major lessons that must be mastered in life. The most common self-imposed limitations and how to deal with them. How to get a miracle going in your life.The foundation of good financial strategy. By Rick Sheridan, ..."
3,"Feel good, simple, for self-help beginners","His philosophy probably works best for the young and innocent. This isn't ""deep"" material. Examples: ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away"" ""books books books"". Forrest Gump could've come up w/ these ideas, but Rohn does speak w/ energy and enthusiasm. Calling him ""America's Foremost Business Philosopher"" is quite a stretch. I'd have to go w/ Warren Buffet. Comes across as a bit of a televangelist/used car salesman and his twangy voice is a bit grating. If you have a college education, you can probably pass on this CD. It's mental candy, but sometimes that's what gets us going... I'm on the fence on this one"
1,A repetative and annoying Salesman.,"Several people told me that Jim Rohn was an excellent speaker and very inspirational, I found him to be a repetative and a annoying Salesman. His ideas were basic knowledge and listening to him was difficult. Rohn seems to skirt many of the issues such as self esteem and self discipline that are an important part of ""Exception Living"". There are many more speakers on the subject that get you thinking and doing. This CD is not what I expected and very disappointed on what I was told about this speaker. I will be returning the CD for resale."
2,boring simplistic waste of time,This guy repeats the same phrases over and over. The stuff is pretty basic. I'd save your money if i were you.
1,The Most Annoying Human Being On The Planet,"Mr Rohn's delivery and/or speech patterns are so irritating that if he DID have anything new and interesting to say (which he doesn't), you wouldn't be able to focus on it anyway. His message is the same ol' pop pyschology fluff that you've heard dozens of times before. Personally, his constant biblical references gave me the creeps. IMHO, I'd run the other way as fast as I could."
3,Broke my skin out,"The shampoo is great. After using it only once, it made my hair soft and shiny. However, after a few days, I noticed that my skin broke out around where my hair fell on my face, especially my forehead. I gave a couple of bottles to my sister as a gift and she said the same thing happened to her."
5,Amazing!,"I got this at the recommendation of a friend. With the double damage caused by dry climate and winter my hair gets dry and brittle if I wash it more than twice a week. This is a perfect solution. It removes product buildup and leaves my hair feeling soft and clean, not damaged. Now I use these products daily (or whenever I shower) and only wash my hair with regular shampoo and conditioner once a week. My hair has been so much healthier! It would have been nice to know the benifits of the differant formulas (one is better for dry, one oily etc.) But I enjoy trying all of them and then picking the one I like the best to buy in a larger size. All of them also smell fantastic! Pricey but in my opinion well worth it!"
2,does not meet expectations,did not make the texture of my hair any better than drugstore brands. Don't waste your money.
4,I really love this product!,"This is not my first experience with WEN hair products. I have been using the sweet almond mint and decided I wanted to try all of the products without buying the full sized products. I really like WEN-my hair is softer and shinier than it has ever been and I have tangle free hair, which has always been a problem for me! I have used all of the different conditioners and for me, the tea tree oil is a bit heavier than the rest of the conditioners, so I probably won't order any more of that particular one, but I really like the rest of them, with the original almond mint being my favorite. I did not give it 5 stars because the products do weigh your hair down more than other conditioners, but your hair will be in better condition overall, so it is worth it to me."
1,menthol,"I bought the 5 samples-size to see which would smell the best, and do the best for my hair. The menthol smell over powered any lavender etc. smell each was supposed to have. If you can get past the smell of Vicks or BenGay, it does good for your hair, but didn't clean my scalp. It was an expensive experiment."
4,Cleansing Conditioner is a nice change,"The products work as described, feel great, and make my hair look wonderful. These are a great alternative to traditional shampoo. I will keep using the tea tree version for my dandruff."
3,the jury is still out,"I've been using Wen Tea Trea as directed for one month now. I'm still trying to decide how much I like it. It has made my hair very shiny, but alsmost greasy looking sometimes, although when i touch it, it isn't greasy. I have washed my hair with regular shampoo once because it seemed weighed down. I generally like the product so far though."
3,nice,"Nice earrings, I purchased these for my niece. However they irritated hear ears, i think its because of the weight and she's only had her piercing for a year. She can wear them for a day only. They are very nice though!"
3,My son is mesmerized by the video.,"I'm glad to know that my wife and I are not the only one's who find the trains to be really mean. All of them seem to have an attitude problem and are constantly doing or saying nasty things to one another. It is almost comical the level of ""attitude"" that some of the trains give off.That said, our 16 month old finds the tape interesting and he's young enough not to understand the interplay, so I'm not concerned about the ramifications. However, as he gets older, and understands more, this wouldn't be my first choice."
1,Role models for NOT getting along!,"We got this out of the library a few weeks ago and I was appalled to see what counts as ""getting along:""- The big engines get miffed at everyone else and decide to go on strike (end of story).- An engine is insulted by the helicopter; they have a race, the engine wins, and his engineer makes up a nasty little song to celebrate.I do not tolerate this kind of behavior in my kids, and I will not tolerate it in a video - my kids have enough negative role models.Look to George and Martha tapes for better role models in ""getting along."""
3,Not New But Pretty Good,"In 1998(or 1999)I bought this on video. In 2004,I bought this on DVD to check out the speical features but their aren't any good games on this DVD,just the Character Gallery,Sing-Along Depot and Web Fun(which is hard for me to get on to). This DVD isn't even new,it's just a Thomas video from the 1990s put on DVD. This DVD isn't new,put it's pretty good. So if you want to buy this,go ahead. But if you don't want this on DVD,buy the video instead."
4,Silver Vanity,"It's very nice looking, sleek and modern. It came in about 10 days though. Longer than i thought. It was well packaged and nothing was broken. I wish the mirror sat higher on the vanity, or was longer. I'm a 5'5"" adult, but its apparent that its truly meant for shorter girls or young girls. I still like it though because it fits nicely in the small room that i have."
4,Started reading,Not done but have learned allot about why I am attracted to certain colors which is pretty amazing. The test at the front will let you know what you like and the book will take you through what you may have not considered.
2,wish I 'd known about the website,"Most of the information from this book is on the author's web site. So save your money and read what little information is contained in the book. The book has large print, large pictures and very little information. Was very disappointed in this book and the other one by this author. Most of what he says is more marketing hype than valid information. Will be selling the copy of my book"
2,Too Technical,"Many diagrams with little explanation, hard to comprehend for somebody not actually working in the program. Hardly no information on Mission Control Center history. No fotographs.Can be usefull if interested in how today Space Shuttle missions are controled and good knoledge on comunication systems."
4,Subject:,"'West Coast newspaper readers had begun to dread the headlines. One by one, the missing Hollywood girls were discovered brutally strangled after being sexually violated time after time. There seemed to be no end to the killing-and no clues to the killer...An account of the West Coast Hillside Strangler murders examines the schizophrenic triple personality of the rapist-murderer, drawing on interviews with the murderer himself, his mother, and the policemen and psychiatrists who worked on his case.'A great read."
5,Remember This Dream,"Very powerful. The author uses a fictional family to correctly & historically portray the plight of the Jews from the early 1900's through World War II. The book addresses the background and reason for the mass exodus from Europe and Russia to the United States during the early part of the twentieth century - why some had the courage to leave and why others chose to stay. And then the author - using true historical figures, events and facts describes the fate of those left behind. Simultaneously, the author depicts life and the political atmosphere in Europe and the United States. One immediately becomes involved with the author's characters. This book is a fast read. I could not put it down."
5,Excellent book,An excellent book that chronicles events during World War II that were largely unknown and unheralded until just recently.
3,Very Interesting,The first two chapters have a lot of statics and history in them. The interesting part begins at chapter 3 when the author includes interviews with the actual participants and their experiences during the war.
4,Last Comanche code talker,"Charles Chibitty, the last surviving Comanche code talker, died in July, 2005, at the age of 83."
1,not genuine oki ribbons,"Gorilla paper billed these ribbons as ""by Okidata,"" but they were not genuine oem oki ribbons. If they say ""by Okidata"", they should really be made by them. I returned the ribbons, at my own expense, and lost money on these, and some similar ribbons billed the same way. I won't use gorilla paper again, as we use these ribbons for bar-coding, and knockoffs don't last nearly as long."
3,GREAT but small,GREAT design but run's small...I bought it for me but it fits my grandson better...One size does NOT fit all...Please give a number or letter size...Can I get it in a bigger or XL size....?
1,"Violence,Nudity,Adult content",Horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. There is absolutely no literary value to this novel. Please just pass this one by. Filthy.
2,This book can't decide what it wants to be,"It's neither a legal thriller nor a piece of literary fiction. In places, Passaro just ends up doing the equivalent of written babbling. It's unfortunate, as the book holds some promise and some of the characters are very interesting and three dimensional. And yet, those characters are never given a chance to shine and there isn't any plot to speak of. I hesitate to give this novel a 1 star if only for the promise that is shown, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,Not best choice for learning or honing slap skills!,"Although Abe does throw down on the bass, this vid is not the best choice for learning or honing your existing slap skills, in fact it's mostly snap and pop. Also he doesn't disect his lines in very much depth. Mainly this vid is just a introduction to the bass's role in funk. It would be better to check out Beaver Felton, Sorry Abe!"
4,two hour christmas crafts,"Oodles and oodles of christmas projects is styles from country to victorian and on to asian and modern. The full page, full color photos of the finished items are great. There are even more ideas in the general instruction section. Great book!"
1,Not great,I have many craft books and this one has a few things I might make but I wasn't at all impressed with the ideas or the book.
1,READ BEFORE BUYING!!! THIS IS NOT THE RR-US500,"Be very careful before buying this product, you will not receive the RR-US500 but instead the older model, the RR-US395. I made the mistake of buying what was shown in the picture, but this is VERY DECEIVING. The first picture is the RR-US500 and the second picture is the RR-US395. YOU WILL RECEIVE THE RR-US395 so stay away. And if your lucky enough to buy from discount jungle *grin* you will have to pay a ridiculous 15% restocking fee!!!"
1,Don't buy This,"Don't believe any good ratings about this product. It comes incomplete. If you want to use the voice recognition software, you must go out and buy a microphone, which costs half as much as the unit. If you want to use it for dictations, the computer will not identify the unit as a DLA or disc drive. You must use the enclosed software to convert the files to .WAV by using a very cumbersome program. Anyone who says this is a good buy is probably a retailer trying to sell this device. DO NOT BUY THIS."
5,40 Reproducilbe Forms For Writing,"Exactly what I was looking for as a 4th grade teacher using 6 Trait writing in my classroom. The rubrics are easy to use and modify. The ""forms"" inside make understanding 6 Traits for young writers easier."
3,Not for 8th graders,"What I love about the 6 Traits is the accessibility across the grade levels. My initial experiences with 6 Traits was in the elementary school and I currently teach 8th grade. I have not found this resource to be helpful with older writers as most of the language is for young writers. With some of my students writing at the high school, even college level, it seems inappropriate. I use picture books for inspiration, but the checklists are too young. I will continue to collect 6 Traits materials as I found it is the best way to teach writing effectively."
2,Nothing You Can't Get For Free Elsewhere,"Very disappointing:1. The graphic organizers included for each of the writing modes are nothing more than I could have found (for free) doing a simple search online.2. Rubrics and checklists included are also readily available online.3. The number of scoring sheets with the different formats, each counting as one of the forty reproducibles, seemed to be fluff to add some weight to the purchase.In short, spend some time searching for and printing graphic organizers, rubrics and checklists online. You will have saved your money and not missed anything in the process."
3,Not as good as prior model,"We ordered the prior model of this wagon before Christmas when it had steel wheels. It arrived damaged in shipping and now is no longer available. Now the wheels are plastic. Plastic doesn't last. If you're selling something as a ""classic"", then it should be made the same way."
5,My Baby Love it!!,"Purchased this wagon for my great grand daughter who is 2 years old and she love it. I had one when I was a little girl and thought she should have one, now I have to pull her around the neighborhood at least once a day in this wagon."
5,Another Fun Batman Season,Great stories with lots of action. Great for kids and fun for adults. Dissapointed with the end...no conclusion. Well worth the price. You will enjoy it!
3,great spinoff,"I usually never have luck with spin off series but here's one that made the cut. Bruce Wayne, now an old man (same voice actor from Batman series --- I love the consistency across the DC animated series), plays reluctant mentor to Terry as the new batman. Loved the opening sequence visuals and music. Series was great from start to end."
3,"Not as good as 1, better than 2","Season 1 of Batman Beyond was great. Good stories. Interesting villians. Seaon 2 - in short, sucked. The studio demanded to make it more ""kid friendly, and most of the 2nd season is bad: bad characters and weak stories. I think Timm Bruce tried to regain the greatness of season 1, and knew the 2nd season was a horrible down ward turn in stoy telling. So, the 3rd season, I think he tried to fix the damage. Less about Terry's teenaged troubles and back to better villians and stories. Not as good at the first season, but much better than the 2nd.Buy season 1 and season 3... and only buy season 2 for a few episodes. The rest wil be a let down. Insead of season 2, the, hands down BEST Batman Beyond story is the animated movie - The Return of the Joker. It's amazing. Buy that."
4,"Absolutely love the show, but this season really left me hanging alittle.",This show was too short and it ended with nothing to sink my teeth in. I love seeing the sit down talks with Bruce Timm n the gang but even that part wasn't as insightful as i felt previous seasons were. But i'm the fan of the show and my only complaint is not having more.
4,Pretty Good,"Not bad although not my favorite, but the quality of all three seasons is very consistent. I don't mind watching over and over again (this goes for all three seasons)."
5,classic indeed,have heard rumors there is a season 4 out there ... all in all great classic WB . kevin conroy is great as the voice of bruce wayne
5,Yay!,"My season arrived in a timely fashion and in great condition. Everything was wrapped in plastic, devoid of any rips, tears or dents. The disks all work great, far as I can tell from what I've watched, and the picture and sound is superb. It's awesome having this part of my childhood so readily available! Thank you!"
2,Not Business / Innovation Focused,"I ordered this hoping it would be good for idea generation. I'm an experienced entrepreneur and hoped it would prompt some helpful exercises. I found it to be 2nd rate in terms of quality of ideas and applicability to business and product innovation. I did find the perfect pack, namely the IDEO Method Cards which give fantastic ideas for product design and customer role playing.I could be helpful for someone trying to rethink their careers and life, but not a rich source of ideas or well presented."
3,Crappy Free Cards,"I wrote a review about this game last week but Amazon did not publish it because the title contained the word ""suck""The free cards suck but the game is okay."
4,1st duel masters game!!!,This is the 1st Duel Masters game for the gameboy advanced. This game will be the bomb!!! If u don't know wat duel masters is then let me explain. There r difrenet kinds creatures and spells. The way to summon monsters or cast spells if u have enough mana. Mana is money. That's all for now. So remember get duel masters for the gamboy advanced. If u want to watch the show go on cartoonnetwork on Saturdays at 7:00 P.M.
3,gameplay too short!!!!!!!!,"The game is fine, but two problems. 1. card pictures don't look like the real ones. 2. short gameplay ,once you beat the final contest you get your stolen card , after that you face the aqua people , whose deck is like a starter deck to me , to get the cards you do not have. I got all the cards , including the stolen card , and the duel room in less than a week! So if you have a lot of extra money you can buy this , if not I wouldn't."
2,"Translation, please!","This book begins with a poem in an unidentified language that is never translated. Take this as a clue to what you're in for throughout the book. Chock full of abbreviations, acronyms, waffles and other items of geekspeak grammar, this book is possibly good reference for super technicians already familiar with the topic. For a user who is taking his first course to become familiar with the basics of computer security, however, this book might as well be in another language. After reading two bad books on this subject, I am beginning to doubt that anyone really knows much about computer security. By the way, I could make the effort to find out what language the poem is in and what it says, but as with the more technical items in this book, isn't that what I paid the author to tell me? This book is a poor value for your money."
3,"small, light, dim - expensive batteries","This lamp is very small and light, but a bit dim. It also uses more expensive ""button batteries"". If being super light is important to you, this may be a good choice.I'm willing to carry a few more ounces and get a brighter beam, longer battery life and more common AAA batteries with this TikkaPetzl E47 PS Tikka Plus Four-LED Headlamp, Soft"
4,"It's good, came quick.","It's good, came quick. It does what you would think. Price was so-so. But then when I got it and was able to read the fine print: the battery life is not very good. Live and learn."
1,Does not work for my need,I wanted some head lamp to use for needlepoint work. It is not strong enough and the light does not get very far.
1,Book light,"this is good for reading a book in a tent and that's about it......................batts last about 10 hours, and cost 10 bucks to replace lol"
3,Cyclops headlamp - good for the price,"This was the 1st headlamp that I purchased. It is good for around the campsite or even for the kids. It is limited as far as brightness or distance but overall easy to use and adjustable strap is nice. If you are looking for some hardcore night hiking or a long weekend of camping where it will require a lot more light, this is not the headlamp for you as you may be disappointed. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Happy Hiking!"
1,Batteries #@$%#@,"Worked OK for only two evenings before the two batteries went dead! Radio shack replacements were $4.98 each, which was more than the original cost of the light. Total waste of money."
1,Not quality.,"Bought 2, first one has already quit working.Also, had to air out for sevreal days to remove chemical smell.I would recommend something else."
4,"Above and Beyond the ""Now that's what I call music"" series","Global Hits offers a way better collection than the notorious ""Now"" collection cd's. I think it's because it exposes people to a different kind of music instead of just Rap, Hip-Hop, Pop, and Rock that has become the ""norm"" here in the states. So, if you want to listen to the same boring stuff they play on the radio, pick up those ""Now"" cd's, but if you want to listen to something not so mainstream, then pick this up instead, you won't regret it. ;)"
2,cd case was cracked...,"The CD was good but as soon as I unwrapped the packaging, it was cracked and some pieces came off... CDs need more care when sending."
3,Hits and Misses,This is a collection of songs that got a lot of radio play in Europe.Out of 19 songs I would say that I personally find at least half of them worth repeated listening. These are not bad odds for a hit collection.Its all catchy hooky dance tunes that you may or may not find familiar. ...
1,A43,This company was terrible to deal with. My fiance was away at bootcamp and I paid extra to get the product there quickly. There was miscommunication all over the company. The item didn't arrive until close to a week after it was suppose to be there. At one point I was told that the product was on back order and wouldn't arrive. Not who you want to deal with if you are looking to talk to a loved one soon!
1,igo power tip broken after 3 times used,I used this item three times and on the third time it broke what a piece of junk. I have not tried to get a replacement yet.
5,Great diversity in this one!,"Mr. Stevens has outdone himself again with this one! He gives teens many styles to work on. He really knows what he is talking about and gives teens a great foundation to build on. His sceans are fun, dramatic, and challenging. My daughter has enjoyed many of his books and we have enjoyed watching her practice! It is fun for the WHOLE family!"
4,Its OKAY,It is a ok mixtape a handful of sick tracks some nonsense(like all the rocky clips) but there is some really good tracks.
4,E-SSENTIAL!,"This mix tape is essential for rabid Eminem fans! Til Hell Freezes Over is incredible, and the battle recordings are impressive (although the recording quality is low on these battle tracks--understandably so). With that said, this CD was worth every cent!"
2,ehhh,"I'm a huge em fan and I can tell you this CD is just OK. It has a few classic tracks, most of which you've probably heard or have if your a big fan. I bought the CD on amazon and it was ripped onto a CD. There are a lot better Em mix's out there. If your looking to spend money on them Green L. is a lot better bet."
4,Ducks in Muck,"Great book, simple and fun. My 5-year old was reading it in no time, and now he loves to impress everyone on how well he can read. Can't wait for the movie."
4,What an Adorable Addition to Any Collection!,"I have always been a huge fan of Madame Alexanders and this doll defintely meets my expectations! Even though this is too high priced for the average doll collector, this might be THE doll to splurge on. It looks so vintage, like you oould find it at an antiques shop! It is adorably styled and has beautiful, durable hair. A must have!"
5,An Interesting Watch ...,"This is a very interesting watch ... very different ... cool actually ... Amazing that for it's low price and all that it does (quick lights at night at the touch of a button) it has a 10 year battery life, while I do good to get past 3 years with my good Seiko and all it does is run ... I've bought a couple of Casio's thus far and you can't beat them for casual style and value."
2,No better than freely available stuff on web,"I'm a developer currently Kerberizing a server application. The chapter on the K5 API was useless. None of the data structures in the API is described and the example for krb5_sendauth is misleading (he fails to mention how the sample string should be retrieved by the server [it can't]).My e-mails to Mr. Tung have gone unanswered.My recommendation: don't buy the book -- read his free ""Moron's Guide to Kerberos"", look at the sample apps in the MIT K5 distribution, search MSDN for articles, and figure it out for yourself!"
2,Disapointing,"This book was very disappointing. I had high expectations for this book, but you will get more information out of the 3 online docs from MIT (Kerberos Installation Guide, Administration Guide and Users' Guide). Since this is the only book specifically for kerberos, it is by default the best book, but I think that most users and administrators of kerberos will find more prudent information on the web."
4,The Emotional Connections are Austounding,"As a 15 year old, it seemed to me a bit curious that May Sarton's book about becoming 80 touched me so deeply. Only later did I realise that May Sarton was pushing forward a very important message--emotions transcend age. Although I deeply wish this anthology had included the poem most dear to me, ""Friendship: The Storms"", Sarton was able to focus on many other emotions with similar strength. Truly a narrative of emotion, rather than an anothology of poetry, I highly recommend ""Coming into Eighty""."
5,"Queen's 2nd Best Album Just Got Better!,","This is the breakthrough album that really made Queen hit the big time! For years they's been trying to make it in the U.S. market and with this album, they not only made it big in the U.S., they also made it big with the Black audience as well.They were never again to hit such dizzying heights. In fact, their very next album would tank miserably enough to make them recoil into themselves and go into hiding for a number of years before attempting a comeback with ""The Works"".This album has a great flow and every track is good. The standouts are ""Another One Bites the Dust"", ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", ""Play the Game"" but really every track is great.Now, this version has been recently remastered and so the album has never sounded better and the mini-lp sleeve design is very cool.Highly recommended for any music lover's collection."
5,Great Daypack,"I know from experience ALPS Mountaineering provides very good hiking products. I use ALPS line of gear for all my camping and hiking adventures.I trust this pack will prove to be as reliable as my former ALPS Trekker model, which unfortunately was stolen out of my car recently. :("
2,Just Okay...,"While the shopping section (especially food) seems to be pretty thorough, this book is nowhere near as good as the Newcomer's Handbook. For the price, I wouldn't recommend it as an additional resource. It's also about 5 years old, so I'm not sure how much of it's out of date. (Plus, I have to note that I bought the Kindle edition so I can read it on my iPad, and I have to say it's a terrible port. The text looks like it's a seventh-generation photocopy.)"
3,Check out the source,"Readers interested in what was almost certainly the source from which Boyle derived his inspiration for this 1993 novel would do well to get a look at Johns Hopkins sexologist John Money's eminently readable and extremely amusing history of the nut-cult ""health"" movement against which this fictional work is set.Look forThe Destroying Angel: Sex, Fitness, and Food in the Legacy of Degeneracy Theory, Graham Crackers....."
3,Book review,"Interesting book, well written, good author. Points out how far some will go to follow the latest ""medical"" wisdom. Hilarious is some spots, poignantly sad in others."
1,utter garbage,"I didn't find this funny, satirical or humourous in any way. Poor drivel and a waste of time and brain matter."
4,Look Out Behind You!,"This novel is funny and unique. I think TC Boyle is a fantastic author, he has brought me so much enjoyment over the years. The Road to Wellville took me on an extremely entertaining adventure to a time and place I would never have dreamed of. Suspense builds throughout the book and the ending offers resolution and some surprises."
3,Wellville & Kellog,"This is an historical novel about John Kellog, Battle Creek, Michigan, and the wacky health institute he ran there. Kellog comes across as a martinette advocating risky diets and enemas to patients. Boyle can be pretty funny at times as he skewers Kellog and his shinanigans, and, of course, the arm of his satire reaches right up to today and the health fad industry, much of which is just as nutty as anything Kellog was advocating. Besides this novel, other books by Boyle I've read are RIVEN ROCK and WORLD'S END, and I've found that of the three this is the only one that actually tells a story. I did not care for the other two much at all."
3,Good Looking Watch But Very Unreliable,"I purchased the Japanese version of this identical watch. It is called PRG60 instead of PAG60 in Japan. After a year or so, the light quit working. Then a few months later the compass quit. Then a few months later the Altimeter/Barometer (I think it is the same sensor) quit. Finally the thermometer quit. Now it is an old fashioned plain Digital/Analog watch. I called Casio. They said they will not fix it because they don't have the parts since this is an international version of the watch!! It is the same watch!! Just with a different model number. But the watch looks very attractive. A lot of people have commented on the appearance of this watch since this is the only Casio watch that has an unusual light purple colored photoelectric cell that looks very pretty. Too bad that it is poorly engineered."
5,Haunting,"I had the LP in the '60's and lost it. The interweaving of Brubeck and Desmond on Stardust is the track that haunts me. Once heard, other versions of Stardust pale. Incredibly beautiful. Am SO happy this is out on CD!"
3,IT S JUST OKAY,"This is an early version of the Dave Brubeck Quartet when basically the latter version has Brubeck, Wright, Morello and Paul Desmond for this cd only Brubeck is present. Good still,but not up to standard with the later personnel."
2,A Strange Mixture,"Lindskold's book is an unsettling mixture of childlike adventure and gruesome horror. Perhaps the oddest part is the beginning age of the protagonists; the oldest is thirteen. It doesn't seem to blend well with the often violent story line. The wistful is mixed with the grim, and the results are unique. The story of a group of children, enslaved by a mad Greek demigod, leads the reader through the various levels of the Greek underworld. When this quest ends, the story is taken up again by the same protagonists - only in their adulthood. The age of the children does not seem to correspond with the emotions and thought processes the author includes, making them seem rather unbelievably precocious. The reader will undoubtedly be left wondering whether this was an accident on the author's part, or a cleverly-contrived use of imagery and language."
4,Lovely,"This is a lovely recording of 11 traditional klezmer songs by a group that no longer plays together.From Freylech and Rabeynu Tam to Eishet Chayil and Ramshinsky Bulgar, it's lovely listening."
4,"Simple, pretty earrings",Loved the colour. The colour turned out to be a prettier pink colour than shown. The proportions of the earrings were also much better than expected.On the whole a great buy at a great price.
3,Worth it for the title track,"I first heard of this album from playing Bee Dodger on Newgrounds, and have finally bought it many years later! :PThe title track and a few others are great, but otherwise it's a mixed bag, as most songs lack the cool depth found in others. I certainly appreciate the experimental humour found in just about every track, but some get kinda monotonous. Then again, it's possible I might just need to give the album a few more listens to let it grow on me. For fans of Dan's body of work, it's pretty much a must-have. For everyone else, I'd say hit-or-miss."
4,Very neat!!!!!!!!,"Even though the concept of ""Dance dance revolution"" is to be active, this is great for a couple of reasons. I think the main thing is that this could be great with people who have disabilities (wheelchair, etc.) and can't use a dance pad with their feet. So I hoped that helped."
3,Ehhm...,"The concept of this thing is pretty silly. The buttons are hard to mash, and it'd be downright impossible to play MAX300 on this thing. Use your controller instead.I also find it quite ironic that there is a picture of a butterfly girl on the package, considering that Konami never brought 'butterfly' to the US..."
3,Not for playing,"This is meant for playing with as a cutsey little DDR mat for your fingers. It's actually better just to use your controller if you're not going to use your feet; it's much easier that way and the buttons on the finger pad are harder to push. And seeing as the point of the game is to use your feet, there isn't much need for a device like this. Let's be real though, the only reason to buy one of these is to set up in your room and put an action figure on top of it. It shows that you're a DDR fan to anyone who comes in, and you have to admit it would be pretty funny to walk into someone's room and see a TMNT Foot Soldier or Solid Snake playing Dance Dance Revolution. Another idea for those crazy enough about DDR is to remove the cord and make it into a keychain; though it would be one expensive keychain."
4,Fingers and Feet,"Finger Dance Revolution is really at it's best when you try to dance with your feet, and ""dance"" with your fingers at the same time."
3,"Fun, but not the best","This mini, mini, extra, tiny dance mat is definately not for your feet (heehee, duh!). I found that the buttons need to be pushed pretty hard to get the game to register. This little thing is fun to play ""double"" mode on DDRMax (where you play on two mats at once) but isn't the best, but the only finger dance mat on the market."
3,jansport eagles backpack,"the only reason why i rated the backpack a 3 is that the colors were clearly green and gray. i received a plain black backpack. wasnt what i expected but bought as a gift and an inconvenience to return or contact to verify the color. when ordering, it never gave me an option to pick colors. should have been noted that color may differ."
4,A Voice for the Ages,"This is not a typical Wiseman release. Most of the material is covers. But these are great old songs done by a master during the busiest time of his career. They were all done for the regional Rural Rhythm label, which sold 45's to the hillibillies in the Wheeling area. I absolutely love it. This is the music I grew up with. The owner of Rural Rhythm reminds me of the great Syd Nathan of King Records not too far away in Cincinnati. He knew what he liked, and he knew the musicians who could deliver it. Some Rural Rhythm artists became well known and others never got beyond regional fame."
5,worth the wait,I spent twenty years tracking this book down so I could find out if Billy Danger rescued the damsel in distress from the aliens. It was worth the wait. A good solid scifi yarn with three-dimensional characters and an exciting storyline. Billy goes through more hell than anyone could seemingly endure to make good on his promise to rescue her. Definite recommend.
4,Good Value for money,"Good picture clarity, colors, contrast and viewing angle. Has all kinds of input connectors. I got this for $1895 + tax and find it's excellent value for money. Comcast HD & DVDs work well on this display using the component video inputs. On the flip side, at times one can clearly see gradients in the brightness levels at the brighter end of the spectrum. Pixels can be clearly seen within 8 ft away from the display when viewing dark pictures."
3,Bound for movin' on?,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of Tony Rice, and have been for years. And listening to his albums has turned me on to a group of musicians that form the core of my folk-roots listening: Jerry Douglas as David Grisman being the shining stars. When I latch on to a musician, I expect him/her to lead me down their musical path. Take me with them on their musican growth. While an awesome guitar player and a darn good vocalist, Tony Rice's path has been, for me, a big circle. In this album we find him rehashing some old Ian and Sylvia, for instance, and bringing nothing new to the table. Nothing that sounds different from what he did 15 years ago. Come on, Tony! You're one of the greatest guitar players who ever lived. Let's move on!. I vote for the late-80s Native American as the pinnacle."
3,Looking for technical aide,"Book was close, it provided a little technical aide but mostly the author's personal style."
1,Hunter Fan Light Remote Control # 27185,I purchased this unit with the Hunter Bayview Palm Leaf Fan. This remote Control is a piece of junk. Don't waste time purchasing this product. I am an electrician and I spent 2 hours trying to get this remote to work to no avail. Don't watse your time or money on this product.Now I'm stuck with this useless product.
1,Has a mind of it's own - don't recommend!,"I bought Hunter's Universal Fan & Light Remote for a couple of Hunter fans I was having installed. I can't speak to the ease of installation because I wasn't around when they were installed. However, I returned one of the remotes already because it would randomly turn on the light and/or the fan at various times of the day AND night. Initially I just thought it was a faulty remote so I had another remote installed. This remote is doing the same thing. I was woke up at 3 a.m. this morning with the light coming on. Looks like I'll be returning this remote as well."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","Like many others who have reviewed this product, I found issues with random changes of state for both the fan and light unit. I have installed this with a Hunter 25578 The Studio Series 52-Inch Five Walnut/ Medium Oak-Blades-Ceiling Fan, Antique Brass. My first codes, out-of-the-box and a first code change, resulted in the fan coming on when it wanted to. The second change resulted in the light fixture coming on when it wanted to (generally at times when I was sound asleep). The third change, now in effect for two weeks, has been quiet so far. These changes wouldn't be so bad, but it is a royal pain to drop the canopy to change codes. I cannot recommend this product, but I do not have a suitable replacement yet either. It is a good idea. It is just done poorly."
2,"Light blows, remote controller goes","I have replaced the receiver twice because of lights blowing out. Each time a light goes the receiver stops functioning correctly. The first time the unit wouldn't operate at all so I spent $32 and 2 hours of my time replacing it. The second time the unit still controls the fan, but now the light is either on or half-way dim--won't go off and the gradual dim function doesn't work at all. Hunter's suggestion is a new unit. No way. I am looking for a better product."
1,poorly written instructions,"I tried to utilize this remote with my new fan, but the instructions were so bad I decided not to mess with it."
1,Unreliable,"While this sounds like a great product, and you would expect great things from Hunter, this is a BAD product. The fan randomly comes on in the middle of the day or night, for no apparent reason. We've tried changing the remote to different radio frequencies, but that didn't help a bit. ANOTHER BIG PROBLEM is that if the power goes out and then comes back on, the light comes on no matter what. So let's say you live in the country where every storm that blows through flickers the power. Yep, our trusty ceiling fan light will come on every time. Emails to Hunter confirm that this is ""how the product is designed"". I don't think it is a design. I think it is some junior engineer with no common sense. Nope, don't waste your time on this product."
1,Lights go on and off at will - common problem,"This, and the 27186 (same receiver unit), have the same problem with lights going on and off at will. It's real fun to have this happen at 3am when you're trying to sleep. The receiver is very susceptible to RF interference, which is what makes the thing go bonkers. There was no way I was going to take down the fan to muck with the channel settings, I just pulled the darn thing out and returned it.I replaced the remote with a Hampton Bay model that we've used for years in another fan without any issues. The HB remote in the same fan I previously installed the Hunter in now works with ZERO problems, no more lights going on and off. Fit better in the canopy as well."
1,The remote comes with a built in ghost...,"Got the remote installed without any major problems BUT the light randomly turns on and off as does the fan (though not as much). Have seen multiple reviews documenting similar problems. At least ours isn't in the bedroom which would be much, much worse. Do not buy this remote!"
1,Suspect Vendor,"I bought this remote from Capitol Lighting. It took forever to arrive. An electrician installed with new fan. 2 days later it burned up, smoke but luckily no fire. However after I returned it, I found same product for half price. Caveat Emptor!"
2,"Power goes out, lights come on!","While I've not had the reliability issues others have had, I have a different beef about this product. After power is restored from a power failure, the light kit is turned on to 100%! Power outages are frequent in Florida and many happen at night. Try getting a bright light in your face every, single, time, a power outage happens. Not fun. So much so that I've replaced all of these with a different brand to avoid this issue. Never had this problem with the Hampton Bay remotes I installed nearly 15 years ago, nor the ones I installed last month to replace these."
1,This thing melted in the ceiling!!!!!!!!!!,"I installed this fan and light controller 21/2 years ago the thing last week started acting crazy, flickering and turning the lights and fan off and on by itself so I took down the fan today to find a that the control box that installs into the ceiling is melted in the center."
4,Very Good Remote Control,"The only problem I had was installing the electronic unit in fan housing, I resolved the problem by using industrial strength velcro to hold the electronic unit in place, the hunter fans were 1987 vintage. We installed four units one in each bedroom and all are working great."
1,Poor Quality Products,"I purchased several ceiling fans and remote controls from Hunter. I have had to return every single one of them for at least a parts replacement. Their products seem to be very prone to defects. There are long holds for customer service every time I've called. The customer service representatives are polite. Sadly, they seem to know exactly what I'm talking about as soon as I describe the problems, suggesting that they have these problems frequently.Regarding this particular remote control. One did not work straight out of the box. Another has failed after a year. I would not be surprised if the other ones fail soon too. I have not bothered to use one of the replacement remotes I have because it doesn't seem worth the effort for such a defective product."
1,VERY DISSATISIFIED WITH SERVICE,"I received the remote immediately and then did not receive the ceiling fan after its estimated delivery date passed. After sending e-mails with no response, I received an e-mail from Amazon stating that the fan was out-of-stock. Now I am stuck with a remote that I can't use. I will never make another large purchase again."
2,It stops working after 8 months,The remote was easy to install; however it had many dead spots. The dimmer on the light was almost impossible to control. Last but not least- it stopped working entirely after 8 months. I definately would not buy this remote again. We have two other ceiling fans in the house with remotes(different brand) and they have been working fine.
3,Fan Remote,I ordered the Hunter Fan & Light remote control with my Hunter fan. It functions well with the exception that occasionally the light will turn off by itself. The fan does not seem to be affected. I think it may possibly be interference from my wireless network which is in the same room.
1,Not recommended for use with hunter original fan,"I bought the Hunter remote control to control the hunter original fan I bought. The installer could not fit the control electronics in the shrould, so he placed it in the attic, and fed the antenna into the shroud. The control turns the fan on and off, and changes speeds perfectly. The only, BIG, problem is that the fan comes on by itself even if no one is home. We had to pay an electrician close to $300 to install a cut off switch, so the fan electronics could not start the fan if the switch is in off status. At least now, we can leave the house knowing the fan will not be running full force without us being home. I am not pleased that the only Hunter remote control won't properly control a Hunter fan. Also, on the site where I purchased the fan, there was no note of this problem, or advice not to use this remote with a Hunter Original fan."
5,"Easy as 1,2 -3","I was not sure if this thing would function well, but boy not only is it great having it on the wall so it doesn't get lost it works better than expected and it was ""easy"" to install"
1,You need to read this review,This is the unit you want if you want the light to randomly come on any time...day or night. Doesn't matter where you set the dip switches it will come on unexpectedly. Hunter has no solution. Some have been told it's interference from another RF device. Whatever. You don't want to be up turning off the light at 3 am. Happened to me 3 times one night. Might be a good product if you lived way out in the country away from civilization.
1,Random,The remote turned the light and fan on randomly at all hours of the night. I sent it back and received a replacement but it did the same thing. Product is defective.
4,Good remote. Make sure you change dip switches from default.,I found the remote fairly easy to install and was pleased to see the fan/light control working immediately. Then the problems started. The lights would come on in the middle of the night. The garage door would go up randomly. Obviously we needed to change the dip switches. That is probably the biggest dissapointment is that I wish I would have set them to something else to begin with because taking the fan back down was just about as difficult as putting it up in the first place.
2,Product shipped in damaged package.,"This product was received in a damaged package. The box was crushed and one of the bottles inside was empty due to being spilled onto other remaining bottles during shipment. However, I did use the remaining shampoo, conditioner, and relaxer creme. Product worked as promised."
5,gatti is something rare,"Enrico Gatti is really something special. I first encountered him in the Corelli church sonatas. The sound of his violin is unlike any other. I am at a loss as to why there isn't more fuss about this exquisite player. He is very much up to the task of interpreting these light weight Mozart sonatas. Of course the Variations are scarcely to be endured and one wishes that they could be scraped off the cd. The sonatas are endlessly clever and melodically charming enough to forgive the lack of anything like harmonic substance (this is not Haydn)But it scarcely matters. One basks in the Gatti sound.I guess there is a piano (forte piano no less) too but one can, with practice learn to block that out."
1,Disappointed,"Although I had read other reviews that said the size was too small, I decided to try these diapers anyway. My dog is not near as big as a 90 lb. dog, and Simple Solution says they will fit up to a 90 lb. dog. Well, these diapers were way too small. I am going to try to rig them, so I can at least use these 12 in this package. However, I will not order any more. This extra large diaper might fit my cat. This is way too small, and I am sorry I went ahead and tried them. I was just desperate to find something that works for my dog."
1,The fasteners tear off!!!,"I bought these diapers at a local pet store for my boxer (he is intact and drips stuff from his penis all over the house). He is just 50 pounds, so I thought surely these would work great. Wrong! They fit really tight and 15-20 minutes later (sometimes sooner) the fasteners broke off!! I even tried using duck tape to keep them in place but that didn't work either. On a couple of rare occasions when they did stay on longer than 20 minutes, they stretched so much that his penis was hanging out! I would give this product 0 stars if that was an option."
1,I got irregulars!,The Simple Solution X-Large diapers I buy for my dog in the pet store fit perfectly and work great. The ones I ordered from Amazon were irregulars -- the hole for the tail was cut too high towards the waist and they kept falling off of her. Pay the extra $5 and buy them at a reputable pet store.
3,Diapers for Dogs,Unfortunately these did not work very well on my old sick dog but I think perhaps they would work better for puppies.
4,Figure out the size and they are better than others,"Once I figured out out the sizing that everyone else complains about, these worked great. I bought the competitive brand and they NEVER stayed on but these do. Even when I had the wrong size. I've bought many of these so far and will continue as the other major brand didn't work."
1,ABSOLUTE HORRIBLE PRODUCT! DO NOT BUY!,Worst product ever! We have a 1 year old female boxer who is in heat. We first bought size large and thought maybe they just didn't fit. So we bought size extra large and we have the same problem. The hole for the tail is not even in the right spot. They always fall down and we have to keep pulling them up. They fall down so her girly part is showing through the tail hole. NOT EVEN COVERED for protection. The tabs also kept ripping off because of us constantly pulling them up. WORTHLESS PRODUCT!!! Wasted $40 on these.
3,Nice to be able to order these on Amazon,"I originally bought the large size of these because according to the description that was correct. But ""large"" was way too small it turned out and the Extra Large does fit well. I then noticed in the reviews that many many others had similar sizing problems.They fit well but sometimes fall off during the night and a few times the tabs which hold them on broke. So they're not reliable.They also are very expensive compared to children's disposable diapers. One reviewer said that she had started using Huggie's Toddler 4-5 instead, cutting a hole for the tail. I tried that and they work much better and are vastly cheaper. However I found that I had to put tape on the edges of hole because if the insides got wet there was a terrible mess.I have since switched to the washable reusable dog diapers which are a lot better but I'm still looking for the idea insert"
1,Too small,These work but way too small. My dog is 60 lbs and I bought XL. That should fit 55-90 but it doesn't. They need to relabel these or make them bigger.
2,Too small,"My dog is about 75 lbs. , bought the xl since it id up to 90lbs. and had a lot of trouble making this stay around her waist. First of all it was too tight. THe first one I tried broke when trying to fasten it around her and the rest that I did get to stay on her, she easily got them off when I wasn't looking. Also the tail hole is too far down and therefore it slides down the tail. Would not recommend. Try pull ups instead and cut a whole in it."
1,Not worth it,"After reading the reviews I thought maybe it's just because all dogs are built different and would take a chance and get them. I have a full grown boxer and if they would have stayed on they would have been great. I had no trouble getting them on her and they fit snug, just a little too tight as the velcro fasteners would barely fit on the area provided for them. She was fine while laying down but getting up to walk around and the fasteners would tear away and they would fall off. I tried several times but didn't have any luck. Would not buy again and do not recommend."
2,Not what I expected and hoped for,"I love Fleck and Trischa. But this CD disappointed me. When it says ""Solo Banjo"", that is precisely correct. No accompaniment with other instruments, so it really isn't recognizable bluegrass at all. I had hoped for background guitar, bass, fiddle, with the banjo being featured. But that is not at all what this is. The things these two fellows can do on their banjos is very impressive. But the ""songs"" here are very abstract..... Nothing I can learn from nor sing along with. It's almost as if they sat down with the intent to prove how good they are and that they can do whatever they want with the banjo. So it seems like they just started improvising. Several of Fleck's tracks sounded almost like practice exercises.... Lots of runs with fancy finger work and no particular melody. I doubt I will listen to this again. Everyone's tastes are different, and I realize others enjoy this ""recital"" quite a bit. But I wish I'd spent my money on one of Tony's other CD's."
5,solo banjo at its best?!?,"The way I see it, this album (right up there with Foggy Mountain Banjo) is an absolute must for 5-string banjo players of the 3 finger style. These two masters, whose playing has influenced each other as well as pickers worldwide, take the ""twangy, one-dimensional instrument for hillbillies"" from classical to klesmer, celtic to pyschadelic. Of course, they show off their mastery of the scruggs, single string, and melodic styles... but perhaps more impressive is the way ""Solo Banjo Works"" demonstrates the vast creativity and ingenuity of these two artists. Also, the album is as versatile as the virtuosos prove the instrument to be... it works in the car, at work, etc... (although, to be honest, i haven't tried the bedroom)Buy it!"
2,Antipirateria,"Este cd hay que revisarlo, tiene la apariencia de no cumplir con las leyes de antipirateria, grabacion dudosa y no de buena calidad.."
4,Great Book,I found this book to be an interesting and fun learning experience. I was able to pick up on peoples body language after reading this book. You must read!
2,Judge the Jury: Experience the Power of Reading People (Paperback),"Not very well written. Information flow is not good. This is not a book I would use if I needed a text book for a class. If I really wanted to read a person using body language, or if I really wanted to analyze a handwriting sample, I'd definitely need a better, more fluid, more comprehensive resource."
5,amazing music,i first heard this on the blockbuster awards and liked it so much i went and bought the album the next day! marc has been compared to ricky martin but belive me he is so much better definatly a 10 out of 5
4,Nice track for the King of Salsa,"This is one of the better track from Marc Anthony's album. His voice is excellent and the lyrics are good. It does get a bit repetant at the end though. Still, good song."
5,One of my favorites of the series,"These two concertos are two of my favorites in the series. The Kullak is a large work, very well written, and deserves an occasional hearing in the concert hall. The Dreyshock is not what I would call great music, but it is highly enjoyable.Recommended!"
4,Good book to read after experiencing a full term loss.,"It is a good book, which I could relate to. I lost my daughter very unexpectedly and was looking for answers that weren't going to come. I am fortunate I can have more children (or so the docs say). I lost my daughter July 11, 2008 so the emotions are very fresh and still very raw. This book helped me realize I am not alone that it happens quite frequently...and to not take any second for granted because it isn't guaranteed."
2,Attachments are not the best...,The hose cover doest cover whole whose and attachments are not built to last. Electrolux attachments that are metal would be the better route to take.
5,Anything you want to know about birds,"If you're interested in a subject, there are times that particular concepts or words come up that you simply don't understand. What is ""fossorial""? What is ""scansorial""? How do baby birds get out of their shells? What is migration all about?While the internet is a great resource, it doesn't always have what you're looking for, and the information can be quite wrong depending on the source. That's where an encyclopedia like this comes in handy.Yes, it's pretty hefty at over 900 pages. It's a solid tome for your bookshelf. But there are times that it comes in SO handy while reading your latest birding magazine, or when someone asks you a question you simply don't know the answer to.If you can track this down, it's well worth having!"
1,This product no longer manufactured,"According to the manufacturer website, this product is no longer made.This is probably the reason they are trying to pass off a different product as this one. There are other 5-B:C extinguishers from other manufacturers. Other than the mounting hardware, any 5-B:C extinguisher is pretty much the same, so I'd look in that direction."
5,It was an excellent read back then and it's still that way today.,"I read this back in the day. Basketball books have been a whole lot of miss and very little hit over the years. This wasn't a hugely successful commercial project because the Celtics weren't winning big by the time Jack wrote this. That's the only reason it wasn't a hit. Otherwise, it's a fun read. Every bit as perceptive about the early 90s as 007 is about fun and gun in the Suns. And the characters are larger. Those old Celtics will light up the horizon in basketball lit for years to come. Bird, McHale, Chief, and the rest fighting against the dying of the light. Sweet words about a sweet team and a sweet game.Roland Lazenbyauthor of The Show"
4,Wonderful way to tone up and drop the pounds,I was a beginner at Pilates and found this video to be extremely beneficial. I could keep up with Allison and her crew and the band was definately a plus (the arm workout really works). She will show you the correct/incorrect ways to do the movements. I did this video every other day and also alternated Pilates for Everybody by Denise Austin (that video is much more difficult) and I dropped from a size 10 to a size 4 in about 6 months.
3,Disappointed in this one....,I was hoping for more out of this one.The length did not bother me. It was the instruction of it that was not good.This is not a good one for beginners. There is no good instruction when it came to breathing in this workout. Breathing is an important part in pilates.I've done this workout twice and both times I didn't feel like I got a good workout and just wasted my time.The arms section is the one part of the workout I think wasn't to bad otherwise I would give it one less star in my rating.
5,Great Workout!,"I got this dvd and band to try at home- I hate going to dirty gyms and the fitness classes here are at time when I'm at work. So this is a great way to do a fun workout at home whenver I have time. Its easy to follow and effective! Not much for working on your abs, but its great for legs and arms!!! I would highly recommend it- especially for beginners :-)"
3,Good workout for traveling,I have several FIRM videos and thought I would try this one to change things up a bit. It is a good (short!) tape to work out with but I would not use it everyday. I think your results would be slow in coming if you only did this workout; but it is good for traveling as you can't pack up all of your weights and fanny lifter! The moves are easy and the instruction is clear and concise. Definitely a good addition to your workout library.
3,Resistance Cord - Medium,"I bought this product for my gym 'senior shape' classes; however, the medium strength was too firm for a senior citizen like me. I had to return it. At a mature age, I would recommend to start with a cord of less resistance."
5,home workout,"This is a great workout, the cords really challenge your body moves, especially the step, step tap routine.I feel the difference when its over. Looking forward to the results after ten uses."
2,Okay for the short term,"I had this product for about 3 months before one of the grips frayed and separated from the resistance cord while it was in use. The cord snapped back and hit me in the arm and left a bruise. But, during the very few months that I did use it, it worked well."
3,Pilates Firm Style--Not For Beginners,"I enjoyed this quick pilates workout but it is NOT for someone who has never done pilates before. Some moves are performed too quickly. There is not any explanation on engaging your core or how to breathe properly. Those two things are essential to doing pilates correctly. It does however, cover all the basic pilates moves. The included band is made of good quality material and used to increase intensity or keep proper form. Overall, if you are familiar with pilates, this is an enjoyable quick workout."
1,1 star is far too generous,"This whole series is a serious waste of your resources. It's possible to learn how to dance with DVDs and tapes, but these are not the instructors you want to utilize. Keep searching."
2,warning!,"If you've just gotten into swing dancing b/c the moves you see people doing are so cool don't get this tape. I bought the series and it almost made me stop dancing, b/c it's so boring, and instructors are complete dorks! You learn some basic moves, but dancing is not about moves but style! A monkey can learn the step and do it on the floor but it's going to look funny. I would recommend checking out Paul Overton and Sharon Ashe, I bought their East Coast tape series close to a year ago and I've still to learn all the moves on them and I dance every weekend! For lindy hop, you just need to take classes, I have tapes for Lindy Hop but when you first start out, you absolutely need an instructor to teach the mechanics of the dance, ie styling!"
4,This is a clear and concise dance video.,"This tape was easy to learn from. The explanations of each move are clearly demonstrated. First, there is a dance segment that shows the viewer an example of the blended moves. Then each move is broken down and explained. Finally, the move is put together again. The instructors are somewhat wooden and humorless in their verbal explantions, but they get the job done in their demonstrations. My husband, a reluctant dancer at best, enjoys these videos and dances with me."
4,Worthy of Rotation!,"These cords are a quick, simple and eay way to squeeze fitness into your daily routine. The workout is 30 mins with simple cardio, strength training and cool down.Be forewarned that the cords are at first, awkward to use, especially with the leg exercises. They may seem short or not as pliable but that changes the more you use them. They also work best with running shoes because there's an arch that keeps it from sliding...I tried the routine in some flat pumas and practically smacked myself in the face because the cords couldn't find a grip.Tina's coaching is clear and easy....and the entire routine is done to the mirror image...so you just go wherever she does... this DVD would def work well while traveling... this routine wont get you profusely sweating but is still a great buy nonetheless..."
4,Great workout,"I am rather new to Pilates, having only used a beginners Winsor Pilates only a few weeks prior to using this one. I have been using this workout for over a month now. I find this to be a great way of jumpstarting a healthy lifestyle of working out regularly. You can reasonably do this workout every day if not every other day, maybe twice a day if time permits. The workout is only 30 minutes long and it targets the arms, chest, midsection and legs (your thighs and bottom). I have seen results within just a matter of weeks. With a combination of healthy eating, this is a great way to watch your body transform before your very eyes. Even for those who are already in great shape, this is a great way of maintaining. A few people have given negative reviews about the quality of the workout... even making statements about someone smiling too much and looking into the camera. Who cares? Just focus on your own personal goal and keep it moving!"
3,Good not great,"This book was repetative. I'm new to this way of writing, so it was good to have the different traits explained. I will use a few of the suggestions in her book for the upcoming school year."
5,Impressive Book!!!,I'm a teacher and I would recommend this book to any other educator on the planet. What we did before the Six Traits of Writing I don't know. 6 + 1 Traits of Writing is a useful resource that every teacher should have. I found it reasonably priced on Amazon. The seller had it in my mailbox within five days of purchasing it. The book was in great condition because I went ahead and bought a new copy.
2,Monarch of the Glen Series 6,"I purchased this product after reading (negative) reviews only for the sake of completeness of my library. I was really taken with this program, initially on PBS, and PBS screwed it all up by mixing episodes, unnecessary reruns of previous series and never completing the series. So instead of donating to PBS, I bought the series. Previous reviewers are correct. The original charm was lost in the end with the gradual removal of key characters and some really contrived story lines. Plus they had to screw around with the morals of Lexi, who was the one true solid character. Too bad, but it was great while it lasted."
4,My required review to avoid annoying email requests to do so,"The item arrived when it was supposed to. The item plays fine in the player. There was one disk that had some lose and was mving around in the case, but it does not seem to be scratched up bad enough to effect it playing."
1,Blech!,"This program is good through series 4. Series 5 is iffy. Series 6 is downright ridiculous. The only good character left is Duncan. Don't waste your time. Bad writing, bad acting, I give up."
1,They Jumped the Shark After Series 4!,"When Monarch was in its earlier seasons, or series as the British call them, the characters were warm, funny, and endearing. As the series progressed, we grew to love the zany antics of Duncan and Hector, watched Archie come to grips with his family and their situation, and all were very entertaining. Slowly, each of the principles took their leave, and new characters were introduced to fill the gaps. The problem with this was that by the time they reached Series Six, there were only a couple of original characters left and the magic was gone. I knew it was over for me when they showed the phoney glint off Lexie's diamond wedding ring at the end of Series Four, while she was sweetly dancing with Archie. Then and there the shark was being jumped...too bad. It was great while it lasted, but when the main characters left, they should have stopped production."
5,works as described,"seems to be a sturdy, easy-to-manage flexible cable. I have had it in use for many weeks with no problems."
5,Simplicity Plus,I needed a quick and easy trailer wiring connection for my RAV. This is it. It eliminates splicing by connecting directly to the Toyota's existing wiring. The hardest part of the job was getting the Toyota connectors apart (Toyota owners that work on their own cars already know this!). Good instructions--less than a half hour to do a totally concealed custom wiring job.
1,Poor customer service,"I bought two of the air purifiers even though I heard Oreck had terrible customer service. All I wanted was the serial number and they kept me on hold for 45 minutes and then I just gave up. I called again and held for 20 minutes and then gave up again. I tried sending an e-mail and still haven't heard a reply after a week.Also, doesn't help if you have allergies...I still wake up sneezing every morning even though the unit is in our bedroom. I bought two and think it was a waste of money."
1,Very disappointed in the cheap parts of this product,"I bought two of these purifiers after watching a tv program. I was really surprised to find how cheap all the parts are for something that costs several hundred dollars (that's what I paid when I purchase it). It worked pretty well for the first few months but after I rinsed it (exactly according to directions), it started to crackle. I called Oreck and they said it crackles when something gets lodged in there. I wonder why it didn't do it for ths first few months. Overall, I'm very disappointed with this product and will never buy another Oreck again."
5,breathing better,"My sister recieved one of these for christmas to help her with her alergy problem. I thought this thing was a waste of money, but I soon found out that it does what it says it does. On January 2nd I got very sick, I was having problems breathing, and I was coughing, and spitting up Mucus(I know it is very disgusting)but I like to be descriptive. My sister recommended that I should use this.When I started using this I instantly realized that the air was cleaner I was not caughing up that nasty phlem nearly as much. Now it is january 9th and i'm feeling alot better, I can now take deep breaths without feeling dizzy and coughing hard.When I have fully recovered from this illness I will give this unit back to my sister and I will purchase one for myself."
1,HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY ABISMAL CUST SERVICE,"Dont waste your money this product does not filter the air properly as they claim.... also produces harmfull breathable ozone.... oops they forgot to tell you that, as well as the negative health effects of equiptment that produce ozone. Mine broke after three months. The local Oreck store in Doylestown Pa. determined it to be a bad fan motor which took them almost 2 months to repair.. They used the excuse that all their employees quit and they were backed up with vacuums to service.... only after i threatened to cancel my monthly payments to Oreck for this piece of crap did they have it fixed by the very next day. Avoid any and all products offered by Oreck, they make false claims , they are poorly designed, manufactured and their service is pathetic. They are good at one thing though, misleading the public and selling junk."
1,WHAT A P.O.S. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i have myself to blame.i knew that broad peeyew phillips was in it (she gets more annoying in every role !!!!!!!!!!!) ahead of time yet i went.....sad part is,she wasnt the main reason this sucked.too much talking (of course,q blabentino had alot to do with that !!!!!) !!!!!!! same premise as part one except now its women who are the victims.what a creative stretch.while part one dedicated its 1st 80 minutes to yapping,it eventually did deliver the goods.as annoying as those characters were,no cast can survive the bijou curse and the yapping here just went on forever.part one also had that dirty feel to it.part 2 had the corny high tech feel.nothing,and i mean nothing made me care about these broads.the 1 star went to the scene where the girl from ''welcome to the dollhouse'' was hanging upside down.if at all possible,AVOID THIS PILE OF STEAMING MULE DROPPINGS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Worse Than the First,"I don't know how else to say this, but Hostel II was even worse than the first. The first was a horrible attempt at a ""Saw-esque"" slasher flick. This doesn't even attempt to be any better. Do not waste your time with this film."
2,Not as good as the first one,I just didn't think the storyline was as eerie as the first one. Maybe it's because there was more of a mystery surrounding the organization that was responsible for allowing these killings in the first Hostel. Now we get to actually see them do the bidding over these girls. It just looked really cheesy to me. The darkness and suspense that was present in the first film was no longer there.
3,Hostel 2 is a 3.5/5 star DVD,Well the movie hostel is back with a sequel. With a surprisingly good reaction from the first one hey decided to make a second one. I must say while the first one was better than the second the second one was not that far off. In fact I felt they set this movie up perfect with following up with the first one. The one guy that was able to escape the chamber has been alive for awhile but has been paranoid that people were coming to kill him from the chamber. Sure enough when his wife woke up the next morning his head was cut off. It had a similar storyline from the first one but it was not as exciting. There were a lot of brutal killing scenes that added to the movie and I must warn you ahead of time that if you don't have a strong stomach that you should not watch this movie because it can be hard to watch at times. Ultimately a good movie and I will give it 3.5/5 stars.
3,"Bottom line, Enjoyable flick, not as groundbreaking as the first entry.","Definately not as good as the first film, but still good film making. Roth was in an awkward position with this movie, since everyone allready knew the big plot twist, there was nothing left to shock the audience(other than bringing the blood, which he did)Bottom line, Enjoyable flick, not as groundbreaking as the first entry.Video and audio quality on the blu disc are nothing short of amazing. If you liked the movie, this should be a definite buy."
2,The 1st one was better,Ok I expected this to be better and more gory than the 1st. It wasn't. The whole thrill was gone. Spoiler here....They show you how these men get the victims to the hostel. How they pay for them ect. It just didn't seem creepy enough. It was boring. I guess Im numb from the 1st one so nothing phases me anymore. One killing was pretty cool... the woman did it. But other than that EH waste of time. I guess it's def a renter. But to buy? Nah I'd never watch it again. So I wouldn't waste your money.
2,Big comedown from the first movie,"So much hype - so little substance. The first 45 minutes or so of this movie were totally BORING! Frankly, I'm sorry I wasted money renting it."
4,One of the best horror films in recent years,"This film was completely savaged by critics, and the public strayed away which is too bad. Because this is one of the best horror films of the past few years. HOSTEL PART 2 became this years' ""bad object,"" and it seemed that all of a sudden the press and media started bandying about the term ""torture porn"" so that everyone could say -- ""oh yeah, that's really bad and terrible -- that handsome guy Eli Roth should wipe that annoying grin from his face and stop making these socially unacceptable films! How dare he!"" Well, it's their loss. Future generations will surely go on to prove that Roth has made (in his own mischevious way), a thoughtful, interesting follow up to his disturbingly prescient ""first"" HOSTEL film. I hope Roth doesn't listen to the haters out there, and doesn't dillute his thoroughly unique style. For anadventurous horror fan -- this is a hell of a ride, well worth taking."
1,Boring Beyond Belief,"No character development. No meaningful dialogue. It's likewatching manequins being decapitated and drenched in catsup.The only suspense, is wondering if you can watch all 90 minuteswithout going to sleep."
1,SICK,"I have never seen such a disturbing pile of donkey crap in my life. Eli Roth needs some serious mental help. Anyone who likes this kind of thing is sick in the head, as is Eli Roth."
1,Garbage,"This movie sucked, this was a total corney movie people say it was better then part1 then theres something wrong with you cause part1 was way better then this garbage movie, so this was a corney movie."
3,ENOUGH ALREADY,"Note to Eli Roth: Enough Already. With Hostel 2 you have run out of sexes to torture. Who do you go after next-geriatrics? The movie has a few new twists, showing how fiends from around the world bid on which victim they want to mutilate and kill, the punishment of bidders who don't complete a kill but the big twist was the end and not wanting to spoil the surprise-lets just say ""The Hunting Club"" gets a surprising new member.As for Eli Roth-A few years ago you made a funny, suspenseful and gruesome film that gave a new meaning to the expression ""Cabin Fever"". You showed you could make a movie that doesn't consist of victims chained to a chair. Let""s try something new-I know you can do it. Thanks in advance."
4,Some classic moments,"Reminiscent of sixties Hammer blood and sex films Lust for a Vampire and Vampire Lovers, though with an increased level of both elements, Hostel 2 is definitely worth seeing though it lacks the grim originality of the first movie. As other reviewers have remarked, it's fairly predictable (especially since it follows the original plot closely) but is still quite superior to most gorefests. The girls are not as effective as the guys in the first one, who seemed more genuinely naive and natural, but they do ok, with the heroine being the most appealing. The clever twists involving the two patrons, the bathtub scene - which will go down as one of the best scenes of horror ever created - various other clips of customers and victims, and some gruesome slapstick moments, as well as the whole exciting theme and the satisfaction of the bad guys getting it, make this pretty much of a must-see for horror film aficionados."
1,Terrible Sequel to a 5-Star Film,"This film repulsed me with the Heather Meterazzo scene. It ruined the whole movie for me and I loved, loved Hostel, the original."
1,A bitter disappointment!,"Hostal is one of these gore films who start with a promise and stranded in the middle of nowhere. The film presents terrible problems of edition entangled confused and unfinished script (What about with the second missing girl?, for instance; What about the dark origins for this disturbed society?).The essential codes for a gruesome project like this have been showed in Dario Argento's previous films for instance in which the dark elements are conclusively exposed and deciphered.A real disappointment because the film began with a very dramatic premise."
1,Huge Disappointment! Sorry Eli Roth...you missed the target this time!,"Cabin Fever was great...as was Hostel I, but Hostel II does not live up to even the original's fear factor. I think the problems was that everything was too glossy this time around...(blu-ray looked amazing by the way)...but I was really expecting a better story...and I know Eli Roth is all about good storytelling so I'm not sure why he failed on this one.You almost feel cheated wathching this...the bubblegum kids should've been left out of this film. Rent before you buy!"
3,Dumb fun,"Stupid fun, not as bad as some of the reviews have made it out to be. The girls are cute, the torture is disgusting, and the movie speeds along for most of the time. Not great, but really not all that bad."
2,Less impact.........,"When you have seen the extras in the original, hostel 2 has less impact.Sure the tale continues, and the movie was 'nt that bad....but all thisgraphic horror has no ceiling...im afraid that we shall see more and moreof these types of movies with people getting murdered in different ways.I dont want to watch rich people get their ways anymore...Was good for a while, but now there is a avalance of these types of movies."
2,Plain out bad!!!,"The first Hostel movie was really scary, suspensfull, and bloody. That's what any horror movie should have. But, Hostel part II failed in those aspects miserably. The 3 main characters didn't have to much personality and you just coulden't find yourself rooting for them. I really liked the reappearence of Jay Hernandez from the origional Hostel. But, after Jay's appearence was over, I found myself really bored throughout the rest of the movie. It's to bad that Hostel part II was a bad movie. The origional Hostel had the potential to spark a wide range of sequals. But with the failures of Hostel part II, I don't think that there will be any more Hostel movies. I hope my review was helpfull. Bye now. If you would like to contact me about this or any other of my other reviews, my e-mail address is Justinw151@yahoo.com"
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Hostel: Part II leaves off at almost the exact point the first one ends and has an awesome opening scene. Last time it was the boys, this time the girls go on vacation. Once again I loved the gore and the scary story, however this ends quite differently from the first one, and too be honest I really didn't like what they did. If this is indeed just a continuation of the story of the hostel, then they could have done a lot better job closing it out. The rushed, lazy ending really left me with a bad taste in mouth. For the most part thou, Hostel: Part II is every bit as scary and disgusting as the first. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too."
4,Wow,"GREAT! Just what I was looking for, Thank you. Would recomend to all who are in need of this item."
2,Redundant,"I liked the first ""Hostel"" movie. It was gratuitous, to be sure, but it also had a political subtext to it, where the young men who go off to Europe in order to exploit the culture end up being the ones exploited.Although ""Hostel part II"" picks up right where the last one left off, any political subtext is gone from this film, and it really plays more like another sequel in the ""Saw"" franchise, where gory stunts take the place of real suspense. Even the characters seem to be borrowed from better films ... Heather Matarazzo basically plays a grown up version of the tragic outcast she played in the groundbreaking ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and Bijou Phillips plays the same cautionary party girl she played in Larry Clark's excellent ""Bully"". The whole thing just feels really redundant."
3,genitals,"this movie was simple horror movie to me! the plot was easy to recongnize and easy to figure out! if you have already seen the first hostel.......this one really wouldn't amaze you, except the(ending)!"
2,Not as good as the first one!,"Hostel II is a let down when compared to the original Hostel. It almost seemed as if the director was trying everything possible to make a film that would hopefully surpass the success of Hostel, it didn't work. The plot is corny and dull, and the actors are not talented nor do they appeal to the story. This is a movie that is living off of the success of the first film and not off of it's own ability to please an audience. Don't waste your money."
3,Hostel Returns With A Gory Sequel!,"The first Hostel movie was terrifying, disturbing, gory and had an awesome ending. So I knew I hadTo see the second part. This movie was good, had a cool story line, and one of the most unique andJust down right gruesome killing scene (a chick naked in a tub bathing in the blood of her victim) EekThe only thing that disappointed me was the ending. I'm giving it a 3 out of 5 stars."
2,my goodness gracious!,"I watched this right after the first Hostel, and my goodness! I was sad to see that the guy who escaped the first Hostel did not last long in this one, and this movie is different because the trio of protagonists in this movie are girls, not guys, so a different technique had to be used to lure them to the Hostel.I almost fell out of my seat when I recognized two actors from 'Desperate Housewives'. This movie is very gory like the first one, though there was also a bit more in-depth examination (showing the Hostel as a business, and the people in charge, etc) I applauded the 'heroine' when she figured out a way to get out of the Hostel alive, that was rather creative on her part. And like the guy from the last Hostel movie, she figured out how to get vengeance on at least one person. I actually liked the plot more than the torture part, because honestly, the torture was SICK. 2.5/5 stars."
3,Slightly Misguided Sequel,"Hostel Part II pickups where the first leaves off, in which you find out what happened to Paxton. Ten minutes later, the movie focuses on three female art students who happen to travel to a small Slovakian village. Their vacation comes to an end quickly as the Elite Hunting group is watching them.The first ten minutes is great continuing Paxton's story, but the movie jumps to three new characters. I was a little disappointed as I wanted to see Paxton's girlfriend, Stephanie (played by Jordan Ladd), hunt and kill the Elite Hunting group, but sadly her character is never mentioned again.The first hour is boring, but the last twenty minutes is intense. The killers get more screen time, but it adds nothing important to this sequel. Overall, I think the first movie was more watchable."
3,FOUR SEASONS IS FOR OLD PEOPLE,"For some reason this movie picks up where the last one leaves off. Then all of a sudden we have all new characters, as if the first movie didn't matter. In the first feature we had a slow build up to the torture scene with plenty of gratuitous nudity. We actually got to know the characters and didn't know exactly what was going to happen. In part 2, we know what is going to happen and who is going to get it and we also know everyone is in on it.Edwige Fenech as the art class teacher was a classic addition. She is infamous for her European school teacher movies. The movie has a twist, but that really doesn't help it. It certainly doesn't nearly live up to the first feature.F-bomb, nudity (Vera Jordanova, Heather Matarazzo,)"
5,Zen Brushwork,Very good service. Book came in good condition and shipped promptly. I am enjoying this book and incorporating the techniques in my paintings. It is all that I hoped it would be.
3,"Beautiful but not ""true to size""","These shoes are really beautiful, but they are SNUG and pinch my toes after being on my feet for a while. Still, I wear them out with cute skirts and dresses to watch a movie or go out to dinner and get plenty of compliments. I really must kick them off as soon as I get home because I can't feel my toes after three hours of wearing them."
3,Mostly from LA EDCs,"Purchased this for husband. The documentary showed footage from EDC in LA, not Vegas. Was hoping for some footage from the first year that EDC was in Vegas. Still fun to watch though..."
3,An Overview but Not an Experience,"I'm not a dance music fan but had heard so much about EDC I wanted to see the film. The film is an overview on the founding of the event, profiles of dancers and performers. The live music shots are great but should have been a seperate disc of just live music. The crowd and dancer histories were interesting. Overall it was too much detail on things that could have covered their own doc, and not enough music to be a concert film."
2,Don't Believe The Hype....,"The potential was definitely there BUT the non-stop interviews and pointless back stage shots dimmed what could of been an explosive tour thru the edc nightlife. also, way too much black eyed peas frontman, will i am. no p.l.u.r. to be found here and no desire to re-watch. this was never what e.d.c was supposed to be about. let ME direct the next one 'cause this is a fail."
5,Immensely Beautiful,This documentary did a great job of capturing the EDC experience. There were many times during the film where my jaw dropped because of the awe produced by such a large crowd that attends. It is well rounded an certainly long enough. There are interviews with some great DJ's as well as performers. Every aspect of it is beautiful and the music gives good vibes. If you are planning on going to EDC or just want to get a fell for the experience you should buy it.
1,Not recommended,"I thought it was full concert, but it wasn't. Wasting money to purchase this video. look @ youtube is much better...."
4,Overall it is OK but could be so much better,"Although this DVD does give the viewer an excellent idea of what EDC looks, feels and sounds like, I'd MUCH prefer more attention and camera time paid to the artist while on onstage performing and then in an interview behind the scenes. The generation that drives the EDC fan base has to be applauded for their energy and passion, but it's the artists that are bringing the true art of EDM to the people. There is far too much shaky footage of the EDC audience and carnival performers. Perhaps there should be 2 DVD's. One focusing on the controlled chaos and love that is an EDC experience and one DVD focusing on the hugely talented and tirelessly working artists bringing it to the masses."
5,Great footage behind the scenes and of the festival.,"Wow, watching this makes me want to go to the next event. So many great perfomers, acrobatics, carnival rides, and of course the music."
3,Eternal Summer,"ok, but i was a little disappointed with the execution of the subplotsabout the main characters mutual interests with each other"
3,It does what I expected,So far the product has done everything I expected of it and at this point I am completed satisfied. I would like a little longer hose.
5,More that a surfing lesson. It's an Endless Summer.,"Since their early days on the net, Tripod has treaded into uncharted territory, bridging the gap between academia, life and the net.This epic guide represents the efforts of hundreds of members who pulled together to combine their personal resources, insights and revelations that came through millions of hours on-line.This practicle guide has entertaining stories and lesson that every virtual surfer needs.It is a handbook written by the people of the web for the people of the web.In format, it is unlike any other book ever written. Tools for Life may come to define a new genre in literature.Make the most of your life experiences on and off the web. Buy this book. It will make you more productive at work and at play."
3,Disappointing,"Might be a good book if you're not a vetern web surfer - otherwise, just visit tripod's site.I was hoping for more ""how to move into the real world"" after college type information. Too much about getting a job - there's enough other books out there devoted solely to that. I wanted something different.Maybe my expectations were too high. I'm just going to stick to the Tripod site, though."
4,This movie is a lot of fun!,This movie was not available to put in my Neflix queue yet and I really wanted to see it so I purchased a copy here on amazon. I'm glad I did. There are so many B rated horror movies that are pure junk and total waste of money but this one actually keeps you entertained throughout the whole thing. I have seen a lot of movies and I always enjoy more suspense than I do gore and while this movie has some gore- it is heavy on suspense. It is very low budget but it works for this movie really well with the grainy feel to it. The idea is very original- there are two killers in this movie so there is really no down time at all LOL I have to say this is probably one of the first horror movies where you are on the edge of your seat but then laughing at the same time. This movie is definitely worth the money but if you are not sure- rent it first and then you can purchase one because you will want to watch this one again. This one was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it. 4.5/5
1,The Terror Factor. Don't waste your time.,Poor excuse for a horror film. Low or maybe no budget. I threw it away after watching it.
4,Steven Osborne plays piano music by Nikolai Kapustin,"For those who don't know Kapustin's music it's a wonderful blend of classical and jazz styles. There are three works on this CD: The Sonata No 1, the Sonata No. 2 and a selection of 13 of the 24 Preludes in Jazz Style from the composer's Op.53. Of course Russian composer Kapustin is not the first composer to have blended popular music idioms with classical form - Ravel, Shostakovich and Gershwin all used jazz music in their compositions, and many composers have used popular dance melodies in a formal arrangement. The works here are played by British pianist Steven Osborne who has given many fine broadcast performances with several of the best British orchestras. This recording was made in 1999 and provides 70 minutes of entertaining, and sometimes challenging, piano music. All the pieces are played exactly as written, without improvisation.Nikolai Kapustin: Piano Music"
4,A West Pointer's 1850-1860s recollections.,"This interesting autobiographical account was written by a West Point graduate of the 1850s. His experiences in the pre-Civil War west are especially informative, as not many first-hand narratives of that era have been published. His assignment after graduation from the military academy was to the New Mexico territory. There, he participated in the short Navajo war, and with vivid descriptions, tells the story well. He was wounded during the conflict and after being sent home for convelescence, tells about the most difficult choice confronting those classmates of his from the southern states in their future direction. Although Averell didn't excel at his later military career, never the less his work with the pen makes for interesting reading."
3,3.5 Stars,I mean it has a lot of songs produced by the Neptunes... Really I think 2 much was put into this but not enough came out of it...I mean I like it 4 something to listen 2 with the hard beats and smooth beats but not LL's best but get it if u r a true fan!
3,"Not that impressive, but not terrible either.","This album is not as terrible as the reviews I've read on here. True, the lyrics aren't impressive, but this is not a bad album. Probably not the best album for LL Cool J fans who are still stuck in the 80's, but it's geared to impress the rap fans of the early 2000's. If you don't mind some so so lyrics, and maybe a couple that make you shake your head in embarrassment [Niggy Nuts?], then there is some really good background music featured on this disc. This is a good buy for fans of production by The Neptunes, Trackmasters [a.k.a. Poke & Tone] or people who like rap music from the early 2000's. 3.5 stars, because it's not great, but the music makes it a little better than just okay."
3,one of LLs weaker efforts,"This is lls 9th joint and its pretty good if your a fan but it has too much RnB like track 7 which is dope but shouldnt be on here as its joint with mostly singing and few vocals from LL.tracks 6, 8, 13 are more hardhitting and are the better tracks. Still radio, mama said knock...,and even mr. smith are better albums. his last one(definition)was worse than this but i think LL needs to put more soul and passion in his tracks."
5,Dyslexia demystified.,"This book is a ""must read"" for every parent who knows or suspects their child has dyslexia. It will act as a practical guide and provide welcome relief from the maze of often conflicting information a parent encounters when researching ways to help a child."
5,GREAT read,"This was a great, quick read. We recently found out our 8 year old son is dyslexic. This book kept things simple... in a language the common lay person can understand. I found it very helpful and have now passed it on to my mother to help her gain a better understanding. It's hard to believe that dyslexia is so prevalent and yet there are so many common misconceptions. I myself have been a teacher for 16 years and have never had any training on the subject. I highly recommend this book... especially as a first read after a diagnosis."
4,a good read about the book of Genesis,"This book was written by one of my seminary professors. It is an excellent book about Genesis, giving what we have learned through the years about this book. It is scholarly done and professionally presented. It is a little old now but still has good and useful information in it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"Amazing book, but it's a reproduction","I'm excited to have another copy of Dorrie's Play. This one I will let children who come to my home read.However, it's a reproduction, not the original publishing. I assumed that when I bought it at this price, but it isn't stated in the description of the book.The color is good and the pages are fresh and new and I'm excited to have a copy of this book to read."
2,not that great,"I was a little disappointed in the amount of practical information in this series, you spend more time on exercises that didn't ring my bell that getting infomation to unlike creativity."
5,Let's be a mind mapper!,"A lot of things regarding mind mapping can be learned in this CD. General idea of Mind mapping, and then how to use mind mapping, what Mind mapping can do, or how powerful mind mapping is....etc. This is very useful CD for mind mapping learner. Listening this cd coupld times make you getting closer to mind map world!"
2,I like it but I don't,"I needed a stand for my Vito Duke bari, and I really like the Herc stands for my other axes, so I thought I'd purchase this one.It is one great stand. Except the stand for an alto/tenor is not like the other ""plugs"" Hercules has on their stands, of which I have more than a few. It is proprietary to this stand and it can't switch sides, MAJOR BUMMER! Does this make it get in the way of the pianist or whoever. You be the judge.Ciao,geo"
4,Baritone/Alto & Tenor Stand,"The usual high quality Hercules product. Sturdy yet lightweight. Had some initial problems with releasing the sliding extension arm for Baritone yoke from its down position, but it seems to work fine now. Packs up nicely and is easy to carry."
5,Looks like a good stand!,I recieved this stand in the mail today and it looks to be very well made. I will put my Bari sax on it with confidence. The tenor sax peg is very sturdy as well.The stand has an overall small footprint so it will fit on stage when space is limited. I saw where there was a review where they complained about the tenor peg not being able to be installed on either side. It would be very easy to drill a hole on the other side so the peg can go there too.Don't hesitate to buy this stand.
2,Not A Killer,This mouse and rat tray has not been able to induce a rodent of any kind to partake of its contents. Apparently the rats and mice which hang around here have a much more sophisticated taste preference than what the tray contains. My first impulse was to rate this with one star (zero stars is a rating not yet available) but I decided that the fact that the contents are in a tray deserved some consideration. Being in a tray made it easy to dispose of this lame product. That explains the extra star.
5,A nice book for any scholar of Gertrude,I bought this book as a part of my Master's thesis research and ended up becoming fascinated with Gertrude. She has been much discussed and continues to be so in a variety of fields. I recommend this translation to anyone interested in medieval mysticism and medieval women.
5,Great for Microphone Packs,"I teach aerobics, and I've found this tune belt to be perfect for holding my microphone battery pack. It's just the right size! The tune belt fits nicely around the waist and can be easily adjusted. I've been very happy with it so far!"
4,GOOD BUT a small waist size AGAIN,"Does the job. But these things ALL are made for SMALL WAISTED PEOPLE. I am NOT Fat My waist is about 36"" size and I am six feet tall pretty normal. But this holder BAREFULY fits my waist. As it DOES fit, albeit barely, I will give it a four star rating. But they should make these easily fit people up to 38"" AT LEAST."
3,Some Improvements Needed,"This product consists of a large compartment for an mp3/iPod player, and then a tiny zippered compartment which I find to be terribly impractical. What was it designed for? What would be nice is to have two equally sized compartments, one for the iPod and one zippered compartment for a photo ID/cash. As it is, the first time I used it I put my photo ID in with the iPod and at some point during my run, I took my iPod out to adjust the sound and my ID fell out. Thank goodness I realized it was gone when I got back home, immediately hopped on my bike, and rode past a woman who had picked it up and recognized me from my photo and I got it back.Otherwise, it is very lightweight and easily adjustable."
2,Not Perfect. Audio Jack position doesn't make sense.,The audio jack position on iPods is off to the left whereas the audio jack hole on the Tune Belt iPod carrier belt is in the middle. Maybe a minor thing but......................
3,"Well, I DID like this......","I DID like this until the connector on one end fell off and now I can't find it. It's pretty much useless without it. And before you say that it's my fault and not a fault of the product, maybe it needs to be designed so the connectors don't come off. Maybe I'll find it after a thorough search under the car seats. Then I can come back and give it 5 stars. It was very comfortable and stretchy. The small pocket to store the ear buds is VERY small and it take a lot of doing to get them in."
4,Exactly what I expected,"The belt was delivered promptly and works well with my ipod classic. Fits easily on my waist and feels compact - allowing me to work, walk and garden easily while listening to tunes."
5,Legit!!,Just what I needed. Not gonna last all year though. I use the heck out of it. Maybe in leather would be cool.
4,iPod Carrier Belt,"I ordered this so I could run with my iPod. It works well, but the iPod is in my back, and I have to set the volume ahead of time. But it works well while running, and keeps my iPod from getting messed up."
2,useless,"This book gives only ideas about collaborating, how you gonna do it is up to you.. I have waited patiently till the end of the book to find something usefull but where you think that might be usefull Mr. Semeniuk only points out some other sources. If you wanna see what might collaboration is and want to read 500 pages, this book is for you, but you gonna do some development and need something realistic, try something else.. i gonna look at exchange programming books of wrox and mspress.. two stars are for the first two chapters, which really do the overview job of the book well enough.."
4,Christian fiction,"I did enjoy this book, but it is explicitly Christian and may not appeal to everyone. Feel like Bunn knows how Washington works, though."
4,Good,I found T Davis Bunn a few years ago and have enjoyed his Christian suspense novels a lot. This seems to be an earlier work.... I've read most of them. His later novels are better in my book...but this is still very good!
1,Didn't work for my bird,"I'm only giving one star but I must take some of the blame. It would have been better if the vendor was to say what type or size of bird their toys were made for. I have an African Grey and the toys lasted about two minutes.I probably should have done more research, but ya know, its a toy, so I went by the picture. A lesson learned."
4,Fits 2008 Prius Fine,"This is a larger than stock filter, I can say it works perfectly on my Prius. Now if it only added 15hp..."
5,Power and Efficiency,"Best vacuum cleaner ever for the price. it used to take more than one pass with a ""good"" vacuum to get the house clean (plus one manual pass with a brush to pick up all the cat hair). Those days are gone thanks to this product!"
4,Amazing,"I really like this Canister Vacuum, it have almost the same operating mode as the famous Rainbow Vacuum, (something that not everybody can afford).The only thing I can suggest to change is the size, will be very nice in a smaller size."
3,APEX - Poor Customer Support,"I purchased this TV for a very good price as a floor model, my complaints are not so much against the product quality - but the companies Customer Support. Since I purchased the floor model I was not given the Instruction Manual or remote control. I have tried every avenue possible to obtain at least the Manual - faxing, calling, emailing from their web page. I have been told twice that these items have been sent out, I don't think that should take 2 weeks. Now when I call Customer Service the phone is either busy, your on hold for 45 mins. when your #1 in que or the office is closed. I found their web page http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/account.asp and am still waiting for them to respond. Because of the companies failure to support their customers, I'm very hesitant to purchase any more of their products."
1,No Communication - Avoid,"Several days after placing my order for this product, my payment was inexplicably refunded. I never received any communication from Tiger Direct despite repeated attempts, and Amazon was not helpful either, receiving many automated, but not helpful messages in response to my queries.I strongly recommend that you do not use Tiger Direct. Buy from one of the other partners."
1,Apex is junk,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
3,A little disappointed.,"I bought this to go with my thymeless herb kitchen items by Corelle. I love the dishes, coasters and other accessories. I bought this tray, but was quickly disappointed as it is made of plastic! Not the wonderful, Corelle material. The design looks good and the colors match, but I don't use plastic in my home at all! I use Pyrex for all leftovers and glass pitchers (My husband is a water scientist and knows what plastic does to our food). So I'll use it, but still disappointed."
1,Nope. Not the Real King Kong,"There is very little actual science in this documentary. I checked it out of the library thinking I would learn something about the fossil DNA of an early primate.Instead, there are lots of interviews and ""re-enactments"" with people who are lying about Bigfoot sightings.I hope next time the History channel will choose to interview the JUST the scientist."
5,If You Don't Have It....GET IT!!,"This Skid Row Video rocks. Awsome footage on the road and back stage and LOTS of full length footage of live skid row. includes the music video of ""Psycho Love"" in 3d and comes with 3d glasses. If you love skid row, this is a must for you."
3,A OK aquatic vitamin,I first got this before trying other products. I did not notice a improvement nor did I notice any detrimental effects from this product. Our fish seemed to get more picky after feeding food soaked in this. I am not sure if it has a taste they don't like or it was just different. Did not have this issue with selcon soaked food.
5,Correlle Thymeless Herbs,"This pattern of Corelle was hard to find, but worth it. I bought 2 sets and love it. I have bought several sets of other dishes but was not happy with them after a short while. These are sturdy, attractive, go with everything and lightweight. They are great in the d/w and microwave."
3,Vegetarian???,"Not that I personally care, but how on earth can this be called ""Vegetarian"" when it contains ""bovine spleen, thymus, and lymph glandulars""?? I just started taking this, so it's hard to say whether it's working or not (thus the neutral rating), but my naturopath raves about it for immune system support."
5,Ow!!! My eyes!,This light is BRIGHT. Seriously. If you use this light while on the road you need to angle it downward or you could blind people with the brightness. No Lie. I put this light on strobe mode and it was uncomfortable to look at from about 15 feet. This light will light up your path and warn drivers of your position. Even if you aim it at a 45 degree downward angle.
5,Great pen great price,"Awsome quality , writes excellent . Would defanatly tell friends and family about it . Quick shipping . I love Waterman this is my eleventh pen from Waterman I have never been disappointed ."
2,Not worth it,I had mixed results when I planted the seeds (they did sprout but not as fully as I would have liked). I ended up picking up some seeds from a local garden center that ended up working a lot better and being a lot cheaper. In the end I found that my local farmers market has some organic wheat grass I can pick up for $0.99 and get some of that every week. I'd recommend trying to grow a planter of whatever your pet likes best by yourself and just giving them that.
5,Cats gobble up,I bought this in a pet store and really liked the different grass choices. My cats agree and I keep purchasing the refills
5,it actually grew quickly,"and my cats are eating it often! This helps, as they are leaving my other plants alone. Easy to grow."
3,Second Try not much better luck,"I think however I may give up on this. I bought the original and had a little bit of a disaster for briefly put it outside (ants attacked). This second time I bought the refill through Amazon. i was so excited to find it for it is such a nice holder. Unfortunately less then a month after giving it to my cats for Christmas, the grass is already almost dead. I either let it get really dry and brown or when I water it it turns moldy. There seems to be no in-between. Perhaps it is the lack of sun in Pennsylvania and therefore it is just not growing right. Well, unfortunately twice is enough - - It was great for the first week but I will not buy another one."
4,My cats love this...,"Having a supply of grass by the windows helps keep my cats from eating my other household plants...I'm not sure why, but I'm just happy it works!These kits are great. One of my cats only likes two of the choices, but the second just mows the stuff she doesn't like! My only complaint is that they always begin to mold before the grass dies. It's a serious irritation, and I've tried using less water, not watering, different places around the house, etc. but it seems like it's just the supplied condensed soil. I'm going to try potting soil next, as a pet store employee recommended."
2,Don't lose the instructions!,"I thought the initial product was a little expensive but it did have a cute little re-useable wood box and after modifying the instructions to get the moisture to the little peat pellet from the bottom of thecontainer the seeds germinated in the stated time frame and grew well - the cats loved it. However,time elapsed and I bought the refill kit to start a new batch. You better have a good memory on how to start the seeds because the refill doesn't come with instructions and the website (when you find it) doesn't list them either. Also the peel-off cover is so secure over the packet tray it is almost impossible to get to the seeds without having them all over the counter.For the price and difficulty of use - won't do this again and will buy bulk seed and peat pellets at the garden shop next time."
5,A driveway saver for sure.,We have tried several different types of sealers for the cracks in our driveway. This one has worked the best first used it three years ago and it is still holding up. Just finished sealing several long and wide cracks again. Love the self leveling since I am not the steadiest at applying it. We live in Rockies and it gets cold and hot in the same day. The caulk seems to expand and contract and still maintain the seal.
5,Sordidez necesaria,"Simple The most controversial and sordid book about Cuba.The worst part, the reality in Cuba today can be worse.SIMPLE MASTERFUL!!"
5,Fun Album,This music is fun to listen to. Great drumming and interaction between all instruments. Wonderful grooves.
5,A journey into the possibilities of rhythm,"The Blue Note debut of pianist James Hurt shows, right from the very opening, the approach chosen to to integrate some qualities that seem to be lost in contemporary jazz: a relentless though inventive compositional sense, a challenging rhytmic structure and inspired soloists. Also, he incorporates elements of such diverse origins as Dollar Brand's afro innovations and montuno-inspired rhytmic inflections. Best of all, the results are a pleasure to listen. The muscular backing band, with concise though inspired interventions by reed men Antonio Hart, Jacques Schwarz-Bart and Abraham Burton, display here a rare level of interplay that only enhances Hurt's original compositions. They're ever daring, but Hurt's inventiveness never gets in the way of the music. All in all, a splendid debut."
3,A must read if you are a Deana James fan.,This story is set in Texas. A young woman must hire out to help the family ranch and the person she hires wants her in return. A wonderful book.
5,Perfect,As advertised. Price was right. Have used this item a number of times and it has proven to be very durable.
2,Hard to Interpret ...,"I might have gotten a little ahead of myself when purchasing the Tarot of the Spirit. I find it very hard to read any symbolism in them. They have beautiful color but then as you get into each individual card you look for the things that will help you interpret these cards and for me it's not there. Then you get into the Minor Arcana and you have wind, fire, water and earth and that throws me off. My recommendation for this deck would be that a more experienced user may benefit from using these cards."
2,Interesting but off,"I have had this deck for several years, and it does take an interesting approach. The problem I have with this deck is that it just has an uncomfortableness about it. I always feel unpleasant after doing a reading, and some of the imagery is disturbing somehow. I cannot use this deck to do readings for others because more than one friend has drawn away from the deck and said that it made them uncomfortable. I suppose that you just have to be aligned a certain way for this one."
3,This book is hot!,"Well, I found this book to be terribly sexy. It had a lot of the elements that erotic romance novel authors are using so well in their novels. Emma Holly's historicals are similar with more explicit sex scenes. This book was a total fantasy and the alpha male hero was a womanizing, unapologetic jerk, but I still found this to be exciting. The fantasy of having a man want you so powerfully that he can't help himself is very thrilling to some women. Winning a man over stiff competition like the heroine's stepmama is also an exciting fantasy to some women.I like Ms Thornton's other novels as well, she has the ability to write in many styles, but I find this book, and To Love An Earl to be the most erotic novels she has written so far. I know that this is not everyones cup of tea and I respect that."
3,A benchmark for the rest of the series,"The first book in the second half of McCaffrey's Talents series, The Rowan gives us all something to look forward to. With a rather cliched orphan-telepath storyline to work with, McCaffrey produces a surprisingly good tale taking us through her life, as she struggles to come to terms not only with who she is, but what she must do - namely, fight off a terrifying alien force with the help of a quixotic Talent called Jeff Raven. With McCaffrey's trademark descriptive prose mixed with her easy divisions of good and evil, it makes for interesting reading as well as a precursor for the better novels in the series."
2,More of a romance in sci-fi clothing...Predictable,"I am a big fan of McCaffrey's Pern series, but was dissapointed with The Rowan. I found the story shallow and predictable with very little in the way of science fiction or fantasy--it's really just a poorly disguised romance between two telepaths/telekinetics: The Rowan and Jeff Raven. But I suppose if you like that sort of thing, then this would be up your alley. I just like a little more substance in my reading, and it wasn't here."
4,It was good but what about the ones before it?,"I really liked this bok but no one is talking about Pegasus in Flight and To Ride Pegasus!Those were my favorites! The Rowan was good but near the end I got bored. I was thinking, ""Just a few more pages then its over."" Of course it ended explosively and I liked the rest of the series. I did like the book and would reccommend it to everyone."
5,one of the best books I have read,"This book had me enthrawled from beginning to end. I enjoyed it so much that when my 23 year son asked me did I have a book he could read I passed it on to him, he enjoyed it so much he read the rest of the Tower and Hive series, and for him that was a first he usually gets bored after the first book so if you haven't read it, try it for yourself I won't spoil your read by recounting the storyline"
4,An engaging book,"The characters in the book are well developed, and McCaffrey does an excellent job of drawing the reader into their lives. Unlike many portrayals of telepathic people, McCaffrey considers the issue of raising a child with significant telepathic powers. The book contains some irritating inconsistencies (where were the editors?), and the powers of the characters seem to expand and contract at the convenience of the author. Despite all of this, it is an enjoyable book, I can recommend it without hesitation."
2,What happened?,"When we are first introduced to the Rowan, we know she's destined for great things. We travel along as she grows up, becoming an intelligent, articulate, and self-sufficient young woman. She's poised to become a heroine who kicks butt and takes names.Then, she meets Jeff, turns into a pile of brain dead mush, and is content to forevermore squeeze out lots of babies.It's sad when things start out looking good and fizzle to a lame end. The Rowan could have been a contender."
4,More about CHARACTERS than SCIENCE ...,"Not hard core sci-fi. The whole setting is assumed, and requires unqualified acceptance. However, once a reader accepts space teleportation (with help from gestalt) and the blazing mind power of Talents, it is very absorbing. The characters are very attractive - The young Rowan herself, with her mane of silver hair and Afra Lyon the humourous if methody green Cappellan, play the major roles in the book. The romance between the Rowan and Jeff Raven is almost a convention. In this and the other books in this series, it is possible to respond quite emotionally towards the characters, as we are privy to thier innermost thoughts, while they telepath, broadcast to thier hearts' content! If nothing else I admire McCaffery for her splendid characterisation.PS. I LOVE the book, but am trying to be objective here!PPS. Keep an eye on your own reactions to POWER and RANK (T-1, T-2, T-3 etc.) while you are reading this. It is quite revealing."
3,"Interesting premise, banal story",This book is OK read; but what it really lacked was tension. Perhaps someone evil to pit the heros against.
3,Too slow and sappy for me,"I love Anne McCaffrey's work. I've been reading her books for 30 years. I found this book, when searching for novels with Psionics in them, and this certainly has that, but the novel was just too slow and sappy.There was very little action, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but the Rowan's life just wasn't that interesting, or at least Anne didn't focus much on the interesting aspects."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This is set in a universe where psionic abilities are utilised in a commercial sense, and have guilds and organisations set up around them.People use teleportation for space travel, and telepathy for communication, all that sort of thing.They are graded on ability, and the most talented can do the move the spaceship trick. The book follows a young girl of this variety, of course."
4,A Wonderful Music Man CD,"This CD is great! Matthew Brodreick is not perfect, but he is good. Kristen Chenoweth is the *STAR*. She does great, especially in Till there was You. She sounds mystical. Marcellus is a bit to... gleeful in Shipoopi. On some songs they reworked the instrumentation alot... a little bit to much. The worst was Iowa Stubborn. Another bad one is Wells Fargo Wagon, though the singers were at there best on that one.What ever happened to the clopping horse feet? Overerall this is 4 stars."
1,The Music Nerd,"Matthew Broderick was horrible as Harold Hill. When I heard he was cast I thought it strange casting, I never expected a boring, static and completely dull version of the character. Also his singing is terrible, it was good for the Producers because he's supposed to be a nerd but not this. Whoever thought he would make a good romatic lead in a musical? He should stick to nerd roles.Kristin is excellent as Marion, as is most of the cast good in their parts, but without a good lead its useless. Go to the original Broadway cast or movie soundtrack if you want to know what Harold Hill should sound like."
1,Butchery,"Don't waste your money.Matthew Broderick was phenominal in the Producers, but he is no Professor Hill.Go get the Producers CD and the original Broadway or film cast CDs for the Music Man, and you will be much happier."
3,"Chenoweth steals the show, makes soundtrack worth buying","I became a fan of Kristin Chenoweth through her role as Galinda in the broadway musical WICKED. She possesses immense vocal control and an impressive range. I felt that this Disney version of the Music Man certainly showcases Chenoweth's talent; she does an outstanding job in her role as Marian. However, Disney could have done a better job casting the lead role of Professor Harold Hill. Matthew Broderick's performance seems lackluster, especially in comparison to Chenoweth's. Despite Broderick's unimpressive performance, the movie's choreography and costumes are wonderful, and Chenoweth's performance alone justifies this purchase."
4,Great singers supported by an AMAZING singer,"Alright, this review is somewhat biased, being a Kristin Chenoweth fan. However, I must say that it seems as if she's leading everyone through the songs.For instance, in the song ""Marian,"" Matthew Broderick gives a great performance, but in the movie, it seems as if Kristin's comedic timing with his words seem to lead the song on a bit, and give it a bit more meaning.""Till There Was You,"" though, is truly amazing, and I would rate it one of the best songs on this CD. Chenoweth's start into the song and Broderick's entrance halfway through is unparalleled.Overall, I think this is a great CD if you are a fan of the movie. If you're more of a fan of Robert Preston, I would suggest getting the original soundtrack."
1,A Sadder But Wiser Girl....,"It is hard to follow the pure perfection of the Preston/Jones film but I watched with hopeful heart. <sigh> I wanted to like this but could not. Gave the one star for Kristin Chenowith, who is always engaging, but Matthew Broderick is an embarrassment. Horribly miscast, and despite have the age in years, he still seems too young for the part. Do NOT make this your introduction to this gem of a musical. Get the earlier version and then watch this at your own risk."
3,disappointing,"I am a big fan of both Broderick and Chenoweth, but the movie and the soundtrack do not work for me because Matthew is the wrong person to play Harold Hill. He just does not come across as the loveable rogue. I also agree with the reviewer who commented that there was not enough emotion. With regard to this album, the music is ""rushed"" -- if you listen, it appears the movie or music director is forcing the pace, perhaps because of the time constraints of television."
3,chenoweth oldest marion on record,"i must take exception to the comments of chenoweth and broderick being too young for their roles. Barbara cook was 31 on broadway and shirley jones 28 when she made the film . Kristin was the ripe old age of 35.. so not having life experiences seems invalid. robert preston 38 broadway, 42 film ...broderick 41 not a huge difference. anyway kristi sounded lovely as always matthew a different approach but let the age thing go..."
5,"Shine bright, shine far, be a star... like Kristin Chenoweth","KRISTIN CHENOWETH SHINES! I adore her voice with a passion! She brings such elegance and grace to the stage not only with her vocal ablities but also with her convincing acting skills. I dream of one day growing up and ""shinning"" as she does! I would love to meet her someday."
1,VERY disappointing,"I had high hopes for this remake given the top-notch cast, but with the exception of Kristin Chenoweth, I was totally disappointed. The movie was bad enough, but the soundtrack on its own is torture.Matthew Broderick is about as bad as can be as Harold Hill. NO OOMPH! NO charisma. It's like someone turned off the power. One reviewer says he made the character his own. Maybe so, but he should take it home and hide it in the attic. Yuck."
2,Chenoweth Shines...but that's about it,"After watching the movie, I have concluded that Kristin Chenoweth (Marian Paroo), Victor Garber (Mayor Shinn), and Molly Shannon (Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn) were the only good points of the film. Chenoweth's voice was truly incredible and her performance of Marian Paroo was definitely far beyond my expectations! I expected MUCH more from Matthew Broderick, however. His performance was very restricted, and not nearly charismatic, a characteristic essential to any Harold Hill. He had such potential, but used none of it. His singing was weak, and his acting was even weaker. I was thoroughly disappointed. Chorus numbers were weak. Everything, with the exception of the aforementioned actors, was weak. This TV movie did no justice to this amazing story. If you want a Music Man recording, I highly recommend the Broadway Revival with Craig Bierko and Rebecca Luker, or the movie soundtrack with Robert Preston and Shirley Jones. Those 2 are Music Man at its best."
1,Oh yes we have trouble.,"Oh yes we have trouble, right here in The Music Man.The only one worth watching in this awful version of The Music Man is Kristin Chenoweth. Her voice and personality came thru with flying colors. Matthew Broderick was just plain boring. I have seen High School productions that were better.Another Disney flop!"
2,Matthew Broderick is miscast,"Matthew Broderick was about as charismatic as a stone in this version of the ""Music Man"". He most definitely was not charming or spellbinding as Professor Harold Hill's character should have been. Kristin Chenoweth was very nasily and often annoying, sounding like she had a clothes pin covering her nose as she spoke, but her singing voice was pretty good and I've seen her in other roles where she shows her talented acting abilities. The rest of the cast was very good, though. Matthew Broderick, is better playing a Harvey Milquetoast character! One could never liken him to a ""Pied Piper""."
5,NEIL BERG,I was In Fiona the mother goose musical which is also written by neil berg. He was my camp director and an inspritaion to me to keep tying in theater. You should definitly buy this CD to get a taste of what the amazing composer is like.
4,Great new musical,I really enjoyed listening to The Prince and the Pauper. I thought the music catchy with good tempos and interesting mix of styles. Too many musicals today get bogged down in dirgey recitative instead of letting the spoken word get the message across and thereby letting the music do its true job. Neil Berg has a good sense of melody and can turn out a good tune. I would like to hear the score orchestrated fully as this would give a sumptuousness to a very good score. Collectors will love this show.
4,Great Musical Merger,"This 1961 recording has a little something for everyone, the Shearing quintet sound on a few pieces, three cuts featuring a Latin tinge, some ballads, faster cuts where everyone gets some solo space, and compositions by Shearing, Wes and Buddy Montgomery. The only drawback is that everything is under 5 minutes.There are 3 alternate takes on the disk, but unlke most, these alternates offer some variety from the originals. All in all, a pretty satisfying session."
4,War Zone a Flashback to the Good Ole' Days,"Fans of the FF will be pleased with this book, especially if you have been a fan for a long, long time. The writing closely relates to Stan Lee's style of the 60's & 70's but does stay current such as with Reed & Sue's children; Alicia no longer dating Ben, etc.I'm at a loss to all the negative reviews here. IMO, this book is enjoyable and offers a new direction for Marvel outside comics and cartoons (and of course the movies). I've been a fan of the FF since the 1970's and being an avid reader this was an enjoyable ride to remember my days of reading these comics and today being able to read more into their adventures. I'm waiting to read the next in this new series!Thanks Greg Cox! And thank you Marvel!"
2,"The Writer is Good, the Cover is Pretty...",The plot is boring. We've already been there and done that...let's see the Four do something new! And a little family interaction behind the scenes would be a delight to read.The writer is quite good and that helps...a little.
4,War Zone (Fantastic Four),"War Zone was in my opion a good read.Some other reviews on this book have been bad, but was better then other marvel novels I've read.The bad guys in this book are common Villains in the F.Fs world and stay close to their story lines.I must admit that some parts were boring, but didn't last more than a few pages.I give this book a good review and would tell true F.Fs fans to read this book. I am a fan of the 1960s F.Fs comic and the newer comics of F.F and if you like them then you will like this book."
2,Readers should pass on this one,"i was prepared to like the book, but instead found it pretentious and irritating. the author seemed more intent upon demonstrating her knowledge of literary technique than in getting the message, whatever it was, across to the readers."
3,"Very watchable but beware of the ""flubs""","This review is for the Miracle Pictures/Ventures DVD release version of this double feature Barbara Stanwyk presentation of Lady of Burlesque and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.The Side with The Lady of Burlesque plays very nicely indeed but the opposite side with the Strange Love of Martha Ivers has 4 ""flubs"" while playing. That's the only word I could come up with to describe the sudden/quick, stop/start blurriness that occurred while the movie was playing. It is nonetheless watchable and enjoyable....I just thought you should be aware of it.In any case watching Ms Stanwyk strutting her stuff singing ""take it off the e string, put it on the g string"" is reason enough to buy this double feature set especially at this low, low price. Her performance in that scene alone is itself priceless."
3,What are you looking for?,"If this book falls short, what are readers looking for? Something resembling (but better quality than) a Chilton ""shop manual"" covering repair of printers and possibly recycling of cartridges? Are people looking for good exploded views of various printers, parts and consumables, required voltages and values, etc.? If so, please contact me. If there is some interest, I'll do it."
4,Pleasant enough,"This CD features 3 cantatas Haydn composed for special occasions, plus Symphony 12. The first cantata is a little gem (never before recorded)and beautifully sung by the soloists. The chorus, however, is not precise enough to pull off Haydn's counterpoint with true brilliance. The chorus is fine in the second cantata, which is no masterpiece, but pleasant enough. The soloist for this one is very expressive. The third cantata is another Haydn gem. The main soloist isn't quite as good as she was in the first cantata, but still very good. The chorus is much better. The orchestra plays well throughout. In short, if you like discovering unsung works by great composers, you may enjoy this, but it is not brilliant throughout."
2,I don't like it,"I've had it for a while now, and still can't get any HD programming. Never have been able to get the on-screen menu to come up on my Sony Trinitron XBR Wega 40 inch HD-ready TV. The manual didn't come with any instructions to program the Samsung remote. The only thing I can do with it is turn on/off the receiver, and that's not easy. Gotta be up close and press hard to do that.I've got basic cable from Comcast, and a DVD/VHS player hooked up to my TV, in addition to the stereo receiver. I've wasted a lot of time and the Samsung HD receiver hasn't got me anywhere. If nothing else I think the manual wasn't as detailed as it could be. I don't know what to do now...again, with it turned on I can flip the channels and there isn't anything in HD. I bought this because I didn't want to be forced into buying the Comcast digital package, and rent their HD receiver too."
1,Not a Converter,"Despite what the manual says - this DOES NOT WORK with traditional analog TV sets. It may work with an earlier analog HDTV set - but I repeat it does NOT WORK with your regular analog NTSC/cable ready etc TV/Samsung technical support, while polite, are not helpful, and the product must be sent to a service center in NJ for ""repairs"". Their warranty is for repair only. I will be avoiding Samsung products in the future."
1,Not for watching digital TV on older televisions!,"This product should work fine for anyone who hooks it up using Component or HDMI connections. Unfortunately, the on-screen display does not work over Composite or S-Video! That means it isn't even possible to set up the unit on a legacy TV unless you connect a Composite video cable to the green (luminance) Component video jack -- and even then, you'll only get black & white output. After setting it up, it is possible to use the tuner with Composite or S-Video, but you'll get no indication of what channel you're watching, no electronic program guide, etc. Find another tuner if you want to view digital broadcasts on your older television."
2,Homer Simpson wrote the owners manual and the advertisement copy.,"Bought two of these items from ONECALL - sent one back. This tuner does a good job with digital HDTV but contrary to advertisements, is useless with an analog TV. What's really wierd is that the instruction manual spends two pages telling you how to connect it to an analog TV with S-video or component inputs but has a footnote on these pages and on the one where setup begins saying that on screen menu's aren't supported. Unfortunately On-screen menus are required to go thru the box set-up. Called technical support at Samsung - got a resounding, but polite DUH from the guy. He couldn't figure it out either and closed the conversation with an apology and suggestion that the item be returned to the retailer."
1,BLUEWATER COMPANIES,"BEWARE!!! PURCHASED FROM BLUEWATER A USED SAMSUNG DTBH260F RECEIVER. IT WAS STATED LIKE NEW. WHEN I RECEIVED THE UNIT THE REMOTE HAD SOME KIND OF FOOD CAKED ON THE REMOTE, AND HAD TO BE REMOVED TO OPERATE BUTTONS. INSTRUCTIONS WERE FROM A SANYO UNIT, NOT THE SAMSUNG UNIT PURCHASED. I INSTALLED IT TO TWO DIFFERENT TVS AND A PROJECTOR, IT DID NOT WORK! RETURNED UNIT TO BLUEWATER STATING THAT IT DID NOT WORK. BLUEWATER REFUNDED ME THE COST OF THE UNIT LESS THE SHIPPING AND 20% RESTOCKING FEE, AND SAID IT WORKED! I PURCHASED A DIFFERENT UNIT AND INSTALLED IT THE SAME WAY AND IT WORKS FINE. FILED A CLAIM WITH AMAZON AND THEY PAYED THE DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU AMAZON! I CAN SEE A RESTOCKING FEE FOR A NEW PRODUCT THATS BEEN OPENED AND RETURNED. I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND A RESTOCKING FEE FOR A USED OPEN BOXED ITEM THAT DID NOT WORK! NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR SO CALLED 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE."
1,Beware: Cheap power supply on all Samsung HDTV tuners,"Before anyone spends a lot on what is quickly becoming a vintage product...I've had 3 Samsung HDTV tuners (2 of this model and 1 of a previous model) and Samsung must put some crappy power supplies in them because that's what has always died.Slow to change channels, slow to power up, etc. etc. Powering it down when not using it makes no difference, they're just cheapy built. 2 years of usage in them tops."
2,"as many things, it was good until it pooped out on me","So I got this to watch sports on my older flat panel at the beginning of '09. I can say I've logged no more than 40 hours on this box and it pooped out on me last month. Not sure why but it no longer powers up, and I no longer get TV. maybe i just didn't use it enough...what ever it is, it no longer works and for the price, I expected much longer service."
4,"Yet another ""one small problem""","The box is much smaller than I expected. That's not *exactly* the problem.The problem is if your tv has DVI, you have to go with a new DVI/HDMI cable. The jacks on the rear panel of this unit are so close together, if you try to use a DVI-HDMI adapter with a plain DVI cable, the adapter blocks the antenna input. This made me curse since it renders a DVI cable I already had useless, makes me have to return the adapter I bought, and forces me to buy the much more expensive cable I didn't want.Other than that, this is an EXCELLENT tuner. Locks weak signals very well. Nice user interface."
4,HD Tuner,"This is a great tuner for HD TV Monitors. The 5th generation chip set is MUCH better at holding broadcast HD signals without pixelation and other issues I was having with an earlier receiver I was using. Would have given 5 stars if the tuner's channel surfing functionality was quicker. Takes a relatively long time to put up the channel guide, and to scroll to the next page of channels."
2,OSD doesn't work through single-channel RCA-type video out,"I purchased the DTBH260F in order to continue to use a large and well-functioning, but old, analog-only television set after the conversion to HDTV in the United States in 2009. The DTBH260F does what it is supposed to do, but the biggest downside seems to me to be rather serious: the OSD (on-screen display where you control tuning and feature set-up) does not work through the video-out or S-video out connections (only on component out or HDMI). So on most older televisions you'll not be able to see the OSD and will necessarily resort to connecting the green component out to your video in connector in order to see the OSD... and then you'll have to move the cable back to the video out so that the colors are right. That's enough of a hassle that I wish I'd gotten something else."
3,Good while it lasted,"I had this from 2007. Today it died, it lasted for 4 years. It is my second one. The first one I got in 2002 for $400 and that one died after 5 years. It rendered a great picture and sound quality, but they do not last. Samsung products do not last very long. I guess they use substandard electronic components. Gone are the days when you could buy a tv set and it was good for 20 years. People stop buying products anymore because they know the products will not last, not because they have no money."
3,Needs to be more reliable,"When the unit worked it worked well. Then one day it wouldn't turn on. I took it apart and noticed one of the capacitors looked bad. So I went to radio shack and got a replacement for less than $2. Replaced the capacitor, and low and behold it worked again. I added a few more vent holes to the enclosure just in case the reason for the failure was heat related."
2,It worked well while it worked.,"This box worked very well while it worked, but, although I did not use it often, it has failed now. Although I have tried plugging it into several different electrical outlets, it just won't turn on. I loved it while it worked, but it failed much too soon. BTW, I had it plugged into a UPS unit that was plugged into a power filter, so I doubt that its failure was caused by some kind of electrical power problem."
1,Worked Great .... Until it Stopped Working At All,The Samsung DTB-H260F worked great for us for about two years. And then one day it just wouldn't turn on. I would look for something more reliable next time.
4,Nice Tuner,Works as intended when connected to my HDTV monitors using the RGB connection. The supplied HDMI-DVI cable works with one of my monitors but not the second; The second has only computer and HDMI terminals. Use of the HDMI terminal requires a HDMI-HDMI cable (local price $65 to $100).One nice feature is the on-line/broadcast program schedule. The remote needs to pointed rather directly in order to work well - The remote's button sensitivity matches. The Tuners price seems high compared with the current price of a HDTV with built-in tuner.
1,Did not work for me,"The receiver can pickup only one channel and that too without audio! The rest of the channels are reported as weak signal or no signal. I have used other receivers that work fine with my Sylvania ED TV. I bought it because it had component out and was reasonably priced. Too bad, it did not work for me."
2,Good while it works,Had it 6 months before it quit working. Good picture and sound while it was working. I don't recommend spending the money for only 6 months.
2,works great until it breaks,I have had this unit for 18 months and it works as advertised you will get on screen menus if you use a HDMI cable. However after 18 months my unit would no longer turn on. Samsung service Department has been absolutely horrible to deal with. One month in and still no resolution.
4,A $150 for FREE HDTV over-the-air GREAT!,"If you have a real HDTV without its own digital tuner, common among earlier HDTVs this is GREAT!I've had it for over a year and it works fine. I have to 're-boot' it once in a while when it loses some channel, but I've never adjust my UHF antenna. Signal is perfect.It shouldn't cost over $150 though. More is just a rip-off."
4,The return of free TV,"This DTV STB works. Installation is a breeze . . . and here in Philadelphia we recieve ~20 digital channels. So who needs cable, FIOS or Direct TV . . . with their monthly subscription fees. If I want to see and HBO series I can rent it at the video store or stream it off the web."
5,Brilliant and easy to set up,"I had this running within a few minutes of opening the box. The hidef picture is every bit as good as cable tv, the digital stddef is much better than analog tv, as good as digital cable, and for some channels is better than digial cable provides in our area. I am between 30 and 70 miles from various broadcast stations and still have enough signal to give a perfect picture. The picture is either on or off - there is no inbetween. This is one good way to avoid the monthly payments of the cable and satellite tv companies for network tv and for a good fraction of hdtv."
4,One Small Flaw,"The tuner works perfectly at delivering DTV pictures to my HD-ready TV. However, there is one annoyance. There is a switch on the back of the unit to determine the format (1080i, 720p, etc.) that is sent to the component video inputs of your TV. To get an HD picture this switch has to be in teh 1080i position. However, my 4:3 aspect ratio Sony TV automatically scrunches down to a letterbox 16:9 picture when receivieng a 1080i signal. To fill the screen on a 4:3 broadcast signal, I have to move the switch to 480i or 480p. It would be much better if this switching function were on the remote control. This will not be a problem if you have a 16:9 TV."
1,No Cigar,"I have a Sony HDTV sans HD tuner, my mistake. So I have looked to find very little choice in the off air tuners. So I tried the Samsung, twice. Both units did the same thing on the HDMI output which was an almost non existant color signal (the black and white looked fine) and weak sound. Using the component connection the picture was fine but the sound was still weak. The TV works prefectly with all the other components connected to it, normal pictue and sound through the HDMI connection. Lastly why are these tuners as expensive as they are, for about the same or just a few dollars more there are DVD recorders with ATSC tuners. Considering in just two years or less anyone with an older set is going to have to buy a set top box to receive signals these things are going to have to be dirt cheap."
3,"OK with digital TV, with analog TV....?","Works fine with my HDTV. When I try to feed it to my analog DVD recorder I get a picture squeezed from the sides. Also it doesn't tune cable signals (proprietary, apparently) no fault of the tuner, but lessens its usefulness."
1,Damaged Product,"The product that i receved was damaged,I had to return it,Was very pleased in the way it was taken care of. and refunding back into my account,Robert Potter,"
4,Great Receiver,"I have a 2001 Sony 27 inch Flat screen that's 100 pounds.This put out an analog signal, it is great.But my $1 rabbit ears only picks up channel 2, and channel 11 in NJ.Channel 41, spanish channel and a korean channel.Tried it in Brooklyn NY on a HDTV. Picks up Channel 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. This doesn't like NBC. Or the signals from NBC are weak.Great Product.Learned Channel 2 gives 1080 signal, while other channels gives the lower level signal."
5,HDTV TUNER,"This unit is pretty good, If there were only more 1080p channels, I would be a happier camper!"
4,Good tuner but lack of support of old TV,"Tuner is great, reception picture quality.But for some reason there is no on screen info on NTSC output.Also 16x9 picture is rendered on this output horizontally squezed and there is no control over this. Aspect ratio setting does not apply to NTSC output. Because there is no any video on NTSC output until unit is tuned to station - it may confuse user that unit is inoperative. (As it happend to me)."
2,universal remote,"The box works. Nothing bad, nothing great.I cannot find the universal remote code anywhere. So if you lose the remote, you're screwed.P.S. Does anyone know where to program their universal remote with the dtb-h260f code?"
2,Ho Hum,"I am using this merely as a digital tuner for my Hitachi 65"" HDTV ready projection TV with Comcast basic cable in NJ. It recognized about 7 High Def digital channels that are mandatory to be broadcast through basic cable.I was quite dismayed to realize that it does not recognize analog cable channels as well. Therefore I had to run this off a splitter and feed a regular cable feed to my TV as well, so I if I want to watch a HD channel I switch over to his on the video 1 input on the TV. I guess this is better than paying stinky Comcast $10 extra a month for those few basic HD channels and that hideously large Motorola Cable box they make you use."
2,Price to high,I can not see paying $179.00 for this when it does no more then a $49.00 converter box. So I sent it back
4,a pretty good receiver,"The Samsung is a pretty good receiver. I am using the Component interface, because my monitor does not have a working HDMI interface. If your TV has an HDMI input, use the HDMI output on the back of the Samsung to get the best possible picture. The Component interface is almost as good. I've tried both, and can't really tell the difference. Unlike some reviews I've read, I think the Remote works fine. The whole system is very intuitive, and I didn't have to use the manual very much to set it up. It's a much better receiver than my old Motorola."
1,Two DOA's in a row?,"Was unable to get the tuner to produce a picture on an old 45"" Panasonic analog TV which currently is served by an older Samsung 151 digital terrestrial tuner. Amazon provided a replacement which didn't give a picture either on the Panasonic or on a newer Sylvania. It looked exactly like the first tuner. Amazon's service was great, but the tuner didn't work in either case."
4,HDTV Receiver,"Samsung DTBH260F receiver fills the bill for those who purchased early versions of ""HD Compatible"" TVs that did not actually have the HD receiver built in. Picks up HD transmissions well using on-air antenna, displays a clean HD signal on TV. Only negative is that you have to purchase a HDMI to DVI-D cable separately. (available off internet for about $10.00.) I'm ready for February 17th!"
1,Died after a year of very little use.,Product worked okay until it just gave out after a little over a year. What a waste of money.
4,Nice Product,"This is a good product. Set up was easy and the pictures are great. At the risk of making this more of an issue than it is (because I am taking more space to talk about it than I did to praise it), there is only one very very slight issue. The volume control on the remote does not override the volume setting on the TV. I have to use the volume control on the TV remote and the channel select on the Samsung remote. This should not, however, keep anyone from buying this great product.JohnChantilly, VA"
3,Acceptable but could be a lot better.,"This is the second unit I have owned as I can't find an alternative product. The first unit I had lasted about a year and a half.Produces an excellent picture from over the air broadcasts (I have a large amplified roof mounted antenna), but has some annoying problems.When channel guide is selected or scrolled the display often blanks for about 30 seconds. The unit forgets channels that have been previously programmed, this means that programming has to be repeated and channel customizations (skip channel, favorite channels etc.) are lost.I would guess that Samsung are no longer developing this product as the bugs that were present in my old unit are present in the latest unit."
3,"Worked well, but broke over a year later","Worked well receiving lots of channels. The channel guide is a bit slow. However, the unit just stopped working for unknown reasons after 1.5 years after purchase date."
5,Free High Definition TV,I put in this system for an older plasma TV that did not have an HD plug. With this I could plug it in as a component and receiver HD. I had to put a HD digital antenna on the roof. Now I have perfect HD from the local free broadcast to go along with my Satellite TV. This box works perfectly and is easy to use and install; it also has a nice menu that looks really good.
1,A book cantaining no useful informations,"The book don't contain informations really useful: the text could refer to many other parrot species. The photographs are very good, but the legends are so incomplete that it is not possible to use the illustrations to identify the amazons species shown."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"If you want an amazon that is well trained, healthy, and a great pet, this book is a must-have. It helped me understand everything I would have questioned before buying an amazon parrot. An all around excellent book!"
5,I loved it.,"In my opinion, this mother was at her wits end. This man had murdered her daughter and literally gotten away with it."
2,Too much got cut,"I didn't like the series. While the main storyline was decent, there just wasn't enough material for 20-some-odd episodes, and all the stupid side stories and squeaky robot expositions made it difficult to take seriously. I was hopeful that a careful distillation might boil off some of the fluff and leave behind a more focused product, but they just cut too much out and now the story barely even makes any sense. If you watch only this recut, you'll have no idea why that helicopter pilot went nuts, what the ""virus"" they're all talking about was, why Kuze's mouth never moves, who Koil is, or why you're supposed to care about any of this. As much as I disliked the bulk of the series, it was better than this.The subtitles also refused to show up on my player until I toggled them several dozen times. Not sure what's up with that."
4,this c.d. is pretty dope,"Sounds like Tim Armstrong inspired songs straight off of energy, or let's go. Like I said it's pretty dope."
2,golden valley beef jerky,product quality was disappointing. each piece of jerky had some gristle and taste was average. expected higher quality than what is typically available in supermarkets
5,"CHANEY, SR. WAS AN INCREDIBLE ACTOR!","Gosh, I thought I did write a review! What a terrific movie! Chaney was such an amazing actor, and the pain he tolerated for his art (wait until you see what he rigged up to wear to portray not having legs from the knees down!). Wonderful film....I really enjoy silent movies."
2,inmates running the asylum,"This is a poor excuse for a thriller. It lacked suspense, was too unbelievable, and wallowed in gut-churning violence. The psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Clevenger, is given too much time and power by the police to help solve the hostage crisis, especially considering that psychopath Trevor Lucas has already mutilated one person and is likely to endanger the lives of the other people he has hostage (including a pregnant woman). Clevenger is a hard person to sympathize with, what with his drug addiction and penchant for call girls (I also found it unbelievable that he could function very well while on heroin, and that no one-- not even police officers-- could recognize his condition). Not only that, Clevenger's success in tracking down Lucas' brother relied too much on luck and coincidence, and the ending was too neat and tidy, especially given the intelligence and volatile nature of Lucas, and the depth and complexity of his problems. Very unsatisfying thriller."
4,Another Page Turner,".......And I thought the first novel had me going. This one had you wondering exactly how the whole plot would turn out with Dr. Lucas, Dr. Clevenger and let's not forget Kathy. You were forced to continue reading because the author captured you from the first page! This was indeed a pretty good follow up from Denial and I'd say a must read. It was full of ""what or who's next!"
1,Possibly one of the worst books I've ever read,"Not only did this book not thrill me, I pretty much wanted to throw it right in the garbage can when I finished it. The narrative is complete and utter nonsense. Anyone who believes that there is any possibility that the plot is plausible is insane and should see the old psychiatrist. However, if you're looking for a few good chuckles, this novel will supply them."
2,I Don't Get It,"Why do I care about getting into the mind of and ""helping find himself"" some nut case who has tortured and killed so many people - including performing surgeries on them that had them cut open, organs removed, and sewn up like a ripped open burlap bag of potatoes? Whether he's crazy or not, the innocents should come first. This book is a joke and makes me even more sure of my earlier belief that ""psychiatry is a big waste of time""."
4,Ablow's most flawed novel...,"After reading all four in the Clevanger series, ""Projection"" is the weakest of them, but still is a good book. It follows up the events of ""Denial"", and it feels like Ablow is trying to neatly wrap up the mess at the end of ""Denial"". Basically, Dr. Lucas, the slimebucket plastic surgeon from the first book, is in prison, and goes over the edge. Dr. Clevanger knows that Dr. Lucas didn't do the crimes that he was put in prison for(*you have to read Denial to know how he knows this*), and so there is some tension when he is called to help negoiate a hostage sitution where Lucas and a band of psycho patients take over the prison hospital. The violence is overdone(which I felt was the weakest point), but Clevanger's investigation of Lucas's past is well done, and we first meet North Anderson, who is important to later books. The ending was a bit of a letdown, but it does neatly tie all the loose ends up, and leaves a blank slate so to speak for ""Compulsion"""
3,Ablow a New Voice In Nightmarish Fiction,"As most sequels go, I was not expecting much from Keith Ablow's ""Projection"". The first novel ""Denial"" was poorly written and I found very little of any value. ""Projection"" however is much better in every way shape and form. Ablow has a sharp nightmarish voice in this novel. He is slowly becoming like Thomas Harris with his ability to keep people up late into the night reading to find out what will happen next.""Projection"" picks up right where ""Denial"" left off.This novel is much more well rounded and the last half of the novel will fly by. Clevender is still a main character that is very hard to like, due to his past and present demons tormenting him. Some of the chapters contain graphic acts of violence not suitable for every reader. Ablow has shown that he has grown a little as an author and should find some great new success in future novels."
5,Hydra's Ring (Outlanders),Good story line as all the Outlanders and deathlands Book series. I have a large collection of both and enjoy reading them and will continue to collect and read.
4,Why Is This Not Widely Available??,"Some of the most entertaining films EVER and so hard to find...These are of very good quality, with prompt service from an independent seller. A couple technical glitches that don't really affect the films. Until someone gets their act together and issues (and promotes) these treasures properly, this disc is a great way to go."
4,Alright,I read the ad wrong as I thought I was getting a DVD. It's in great shape (CD). The general apperance is excellent.
2,Correlle spoon Rest,Very nice appearance and function but not happy with deeply embedded darkened burned area from being next to burner. Fortunate this did not cause fire.
3,Largely leftovers from the Monk's Music session,"Now that the Carnegie Hall performance by Monk and Trane is widely available, it's safe to knock this album off its pedestal a bit. Without denigrating any of the fine and lovely music herein, this album is really just alternative takes from the session that produced the tremendous Monk's Music album - which, if you haven't heard yet, you should drop what you are doing and go listen to forthwith. Meanwhile, Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane is padded out to full-album length with one spontaneous solo improvisation by Monk, here entitled ""Functional"". And that's what it is. It's as pleasant as all of Monk's solo piano musings, but rather themeless and shapeless. It's like they set the tape machine to running hoping Monk would come up with something ... but nothing really happened. That leaves just two tunes here that can't be heard elsewhere, ""Trinkle Tinkle"" and ""Nutty"", but that's a pretty slim basis for calling this a classic album, isn't it?"
5,Trane and Monk. What could be better?,"This CD is great. It's one of the best I have ever listened to. Two of the most ingenious musicians in the history of jazz, on one recording. Buy this CD!"
5,One of monk's best and one of coltrane's best,In 1957 Thelonious Monk was working at the five spot club in Harlem and John Coltrane just came out of Miles Davis'quintet to start his solo career. But right before that he spent nine months with Thelonious Monk and his band. They played at the five spot club a lot too. On this album the best songs are Ruby my Dear and Trinkle Tinkle but that doesn't mean the whole album isn't good don't get that mistaken.
4,Mezzo Mez,"I loved half the songs -- Trinkle, Trinkle, Ruby My Dear, Nutty -- and disliked the rest. I don' dig discordant jazz, man, I dig beebop! This is a mono live recording so adjust your speakers accordingly. 5.1 sounds like crud."
5,beautiful,"this has got to be my favorite jazz recording. I'm not even going to try to describe it, you need to hear it for yourself but I would like to mention another disc that complements this one very well. It's called 'Live at the Five Spot Discovery!', and it's on blue note. It was recorded by Coltrane's wife late in the summer of 57, and features excellent live versions of trinkle tinkle and epistrophy as well as others. The sound quality is not as good as this disc, but listening to the two one after the other can be very rewarding. I've recommended 'Monk with Trane' to several people who haven't experienced much jazz, and while Monk can be rough starting point for a jazz collection, I think the material is good enough that it will win over anyone even slightly inclined to appreciate jazz if given a chance."
4,Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane,"All compositions were written by Thelonious Monk. If you are at all familiar with Monk, you will not be disappointed. There is an easy familiarity to some of the songs, and that wonderful twisted oddness that is Thelonious Monk in some songs. John Coltrane plays on five of the six cuts with a trio or quartet. Track #6 is Monk solo on the piano. Although it is approx. 38 minutes, with only one cut in stereo, it is a good addition to the collections of those who want some more Monk or Coltrane."
5,two two two greats in one,My collection of jazz recording has grown a lot in the past 5 years. It took me a while to like this album but once I did it became a favorite. I like the easy way they bring their music together without being selfish. Recommended to all.
5,Playfully Brilliant,"When two of the greatest jazz musicians of all time get together, one would expect nothing less than sheer brilliance. This album delivers. There is a wonderful playfulness to this album that makes it one of my favorites."
5,great collection,"people have always dogged larry for being a softball interviewer. I think he allows subjects to make or break themselves via their own words and actions. It beats watching the shoutfests masking themselves as 'tough' interviews these days.You either like Larry or you don't. If you like the show, or have watched it through the years, you'll love this DVD set. It really is outstanding. If you don't like larry, which is apparent from some of the previous posts, then why on earth buy the DVD?I highly recommend this DVD as a gift for the news conscience television/dvd viewer."
3,Where are the sport stars interviews,"This looks and sounds like a good collecton of interviews from all areas of celebrity fields but where are the great sport stars inteviews, like michael jordan,ali,magic johnson,tiger woods and the interview larry did with mike tyson in jail,etc.I would have given this 6 stars if included a segment of sport stars,hopefully he can bring out another dvd just for the greatest interviews of sport stars past and present."
3,A mediocrA CNN Legend,"Dear Readers,Larry King is a fixture on CNN, and I watch his show fairly regularly. I watch his show mostly for the entertainment value of his program, not to see a series of stellar interviews. Another reviewer on this page notes that King does not do any research into his show guests in order to keep the interviews ""fresh."" What this strategy guarantees, however, is that the guests will be able to run with the show and talk only about what they see fit, totally sidelining King. The ""interviews"" thus turn out to be more of a PR stunt to the benefit of the guests than anything else. It is a rare case in which King does in fact do a great interview, but I have seen it happen!If you want to see interviews with substance, do not watch ""Larry King Live."" Watch Charlie Rose, or 60 Minutes. Larry King's program is entertaining at times, but it is not worth watching for the interviews.Happy Watching!--Daniel"
1,Larry King is a JOKE!,"....1 star for the great interview subjects..I'd give this 3 stars if they had an option to watch without LARRY's idiotic interruptions. This ""journalist"" claims he doesn't do any research on his subjects to keep his interviews ""fresh""...oye vey! He is a moron! The only thing worse than his on air interviews are his equally idiotic movie reviews...""The greatest movie of all time!""...is standard for him. How this guy has made the living he has for all these decades is proof that this country is going to hell."
3,Lorraine's review of Larry King's DVD Set,"Although I like Larry King and his style of interviewing guests I was disappointed that this set of DVDs jumps from one person to another and then back again instead of showing the whole interview in its entirety. What I saw on TV as an advertisement is exactly how the DVD is so I guess I got what they portrayed, except that I thought that the TV ad was snippets of the DVD and not the actual DVD."
2,No scene selection,"I gave this two stars because it was released at all. I think atleast ONE full episode maybe of the first episode in 1985 should have been included. Let alone, i should have been able to choose what interviews i wanted to see, you cant even skip chapters to various interviews without missing tons! I was very disappointed with this DVD and returned it."
1,Disappointed,"Well, I'm disappointed with the ""Larry King Interviews"" dvds. I've only watched part of the first disc, which is the one with entertainers, but disappointed with the presentation.The quality is great, but there is no scene selection or scene guide to any of the interviews, mainly because there are no complete full interviews with any of the people he talks to. Just a hodgepodge of clips with the celebrities talking about whatever the subject is that he introduces (relationships, success, etc).I'm sorry I bought this, I should have stayed with my original plan to rent it.Oh well, that's the way it goes."
4,not too shabby,"Gotta say, i've used several review book for the boards, and this one certainly has good stuff. easy to use tables, graphs, and a compilation of all the important stuff from the other review books. not a bible like first aid, but a good, clean comprehensive review. helped me match ortho baby.good luck"
2,Very general.,"This book covers general aspects of Oracle Application Server 10g. It is like reading an Oracle documentation, it does not give any interesting tips and tricks that I would like to see when I pay for a book, rather than seeing the same content when I read an online Oracle documentation. The only good aspect of this book might be the fact that they give you an organized but general overview of Oracle Application Server 10g, it is helpful and practical but does not go deep enough to cover some aspects that you will not see on an online Oracle documentation."
5,Detailed reference to the Oracle Application Server 10g,"Detailed reference to the Oracle Application Server 10g that provides background information about Oracle Application Server 10g, descriptions of its purpose and function, and numerous examples of its use.Thank you"
3,Great Learning Game,"I bought the Leapster (triangle version) for my 4 year old son for his birthday, and he absolutley LOVES it. He also has the V-Smile game system for the TV, and the graphics are so much better with the Leapster. The only reason I gave 3 stars was the system stopped working after about 3 weeks. It would work some of the time, but the touch screen parts of the game began to stop working. I took it back to the local Toys R Us, and got him the rectangle version, after remebering another parent had the same issue. So far, so good. A set of batteries lasted him about 3 weeks, and that was him playing EVERY day. I was able to find the charging system at Walmart for [...]."
4,leapster,"the leapster itself was great. My son just turned two and he plays with it for hours. He has thrown it A LOT butit is still holding up well. The only thing is the batteries go FAST so get the charger. Also, when i ordered it the screen cover was broken. I never returned it because i figured he would break it anyway."
2,Not suitable for carrying anything that could spill!,"The tray is beautiful and just what I wanted, but there is a slight edge around the inside of the tray which causes anything that hits the edge to topple to the floor, especially wine glasses, Tabasco bottles, salt shakers, etc. Too bad."
2,A New York Snob Speaks,"Nora Ephron is quite sure of herself and her friends, and laughs heartily at the yahoos in the Midwest who cook and love their husbands. While her writing is often amusing, her attitude of condescension and wearying self-glorification is grotesque. And to see her way back at the beginning of the Women's Movement equally sure of how circumstances would improve for women is especially painful. She poo-poohs those who wonder if women's life will actually improve, (and her own ""Encounter Group"" partners certainly cast doubt upon that) and lives in a world where people such as herself need not be troubled by real life.As a historical document there is much to glean. For instance, the disgust with Watergate is palpable; yet our disgust with far greater crimes today is much less apparent. A clever lady, with a few interesting observations, but annoying and smug without being especially insightful."
2,Funny at times but some material very dated,I enjoyed part of this book. I laughed at a few of her stories but some of the chapters were so dated that I didn't know what she was talking about let alone whether it was funny. Maybe I was a bit too young to appreciate it all.
2,Disappointing if you've read th original edition,"I feel completely bilked by this book. I had read the original edition, and loved it, when I was a teenager, so was thrilled to see it back in print. WELL! Unfortunately, the editors have actually taken a few of the articles from the original, packed in a few chapters of Scribble Scribble (which I loathed), and a random Esquire article. Ugh! I wanted the RoseMary Woods chapter. I wanted the Linda Lovelace chapter. I wanted the articles I remembered fondly. Instead, I got this dreck. The only reason I don't rate it even lower is because the writing is, as ever, quite good. But if it's not going to be the actual book it purports to be, I wish Modern Library would change the title...."
3,"Collection of essays - some good, some not-so-good","This collection of essays is just being sold probably because of the success of some other books by Nora Ephron. Some of the essays are dated, although some are worthy entertainment."
5,The third and Final season,The black stallion has its third and final season here! Alec and the Black are such good friends. Their trainer Henry Daily is proud of them for all of their acccomplishments on or off track. Anyone who loves races or horses or both should defniately have this added to thier home video libraries. They may never know what they are missing! Hooray for the complete third season of The Adventures of the Black Stallion!
4,The Adventures of the Black Stallion,I loved this series! I wish they had made more. The only problem I had was with the third season. The box was all cardboard. You have to slide the discs in and out like you do with audio books. The sliding gives the discs scratches.
4,"Fun, adventerous stories, beautiful scenery & horses","We enjoy watching this series about the black stallion. It stars Mickey Rooney who, years ago, as a young actor was the guiding trainer for a young girl jockey in the movie National Velvet.Micky Rooney brings his acting experience and natural grumbly older trainer image to the small screen, now guiding young Alex Ramsey to ride and train the famous Black Stallion to make racetrack history.It is not all only about each race, but of travels to different countries and the beautiful old estates they find to stable and train the beautiful Black from.The cast includes a young lady -who also aspires to be a racetrack jockey- her mom and veterinarian dad, all Alex's friends and sometimes partners in adventures, .Fun for all ages, I'd think."
4,Good Gift for a Young Horse Lover,"I bought this for my Daugter and she enjoyed it very much. I'm not sure how much repeat watching she'll do as she becomes an adult, but it this whole series has seen a fair amount of play on long trips in the back of our van. My boys enjoyed it as well as did I. Granted it is a little corny sometimes and some of the stories are a little far fethched, but it was good entertainment and offered some very good life lessons for kids and young adults."
2,Kiddie Horror,"R.L. Stine was probably the most widely read author when I was in elementary school in the early 90s. I was into Stephen King, Hardy Boys & Choose Your Own Adventure. I picked this one up used at a library as my first Stine read, and if you can't tell by the cover artwork, it's shlock horror for kids. As a quick horror adventure, it's not bad, but he lacks depth. Still read him if you must; when I was in college I was into: Aleister Crowley, Dione Fortune, Konstantinos, Silver Ravenwolf, Ray Buckland, Gerald Gardner and Gavin Baddeley. Stine compares to them, but not as favorably. The consensus was that Stine sold out. A kiddie horror icon."
3,A book that keeps on coming with surprises.,With the words See you on Halloween night written across the wall in blood was just the beging of a living nightmare for Brenda.The story witch the so called evil cousin is plotting to destryo her live until she takes matter into her own hands.But wait if the cousin isn't really doing it then who is.
3,This Halloween's for real,"Brenda is the annoying Neve Campbell/Jennifer Love Hewit characther of this novel, so naturally, she not gonna die ( pity ). Halley is the fun, sex seeking cousin, who wants everything that Brenda owns. Your typical sister/sister story, until Brenda wants Halley dead, then someone want Brenda dead. But who ???. It's too obivious to be Halley, so who else is there ???"
4,Good ideas for Michigan landscaping,"This book is a good source for midwest-specific plantings and landscape ideas. I found I didn't have to look up the growing zones of plants I found interesting, wondering ""Would this plant grow well around here?""I also enjoy the overall friendly tone of the text. Some other books of this type that I own are written in a stuffy, almost highbrow manner.The only thing I would have liked to have seen more of in this book is more actual photographs of the landscapes. There are many photos of the featured plants, but the book relies heavily on artwork for the landscape design images."
4,Excellent Introduction to early Islamic History,"The author provides an excellent introductory narrative to the early period of Islamic history. Utilizing the most recent scholarship in the area of Near Eastern Islamic history, he provides a good overview of the events that gave shape to the first two Islamic empires, the Ummayyads and the Abbassids. The editors of the series are to be applauded for their approach to the subject matter. The book focuses not only on the political actors, but also on significant personalities including scholars, women, and writers, and also includes relevant documents which gave rise to early Islamic thought.A very good bibliography provides useful additional sources for more specific areas of reading and research."
4,Arrived in good condition,Prompt delivery and the book is in very good condition. Bought it used but looks new. Will definitely order from this seller again.
4,Visual Feast,"I found this book to be a very rich and inspiring perspective on the historic use of photography. Wonderfully illustrated with examples from the beginnings of photo-experimentation to masters like Richard Avedon, this tome is worth buying for the illustrations alone. If you like this comprehensive analysis of the frisson between representation and being, I also recommend ""Pictures of the Body, Pain & Metamorphosis"" by James Elkins."
5,Best of service,"This service was excellent and the item was as described. I thought it was going to be a few weeks but it arrived within a few days. I'm happy when I can get a good book that is not well known, early."
1,Stay away,This product did not work as expected. And upon returning received a great deal of grief and still have not received funds
5,Multi-code remote transmitter,Excellent product. It met all of my expectations. This is the second unit like this that I have purchased for electronic gates on my deer lease. It's easy to program and works every time. Well worth the price
2,Could have been much better,"I bought this book to get a working overview of Unicenter. Most everything in the book can be learned by simply banging on the product for a week or two.The most serious problem I had with the book is the authors attempt at ""cutsie"" humor throughout the book. I found it to be beyond distracting and actually quite annoying. For example her description of a firewall is ""What is a firewall? Well I dont know but I know it keeps me from my online gambling site at work"" and references to MIB as Men-In-Black and other nonsense.Had she left out the nonsensical the book could have been at least half the size and probably a pretty good working reference. The nonsense at times was distracting and obfuscated the material that she was trying to get across."
2,Very Dated Material,"This book would be great if you were working with TNG 2.0 and 2.2 but the software has been through a lot of upgrades and as a consequence, the material is ancient. It gives a good foothold on the foundations of Unicenter, but if you are going to go for certification or try to learn how to run Unicenter NSM from this book, forget it."
5,Fine little drive,"Got this primarily to house my bloated iTunes music library (120GB), rather than keeping it on my laptop's internal drive. Comes with a good leather case, is small & sleek, and goes wherever my laptop goes."
3,Solid Live Album,"UFO was at their best on this disc, however that still comes up a little short when compared to the great bands of the 70's. I like the album and there is some great guitar work from MS but the songs are not as strong as compared to a collection from bands like the Scorpions or AC/DC. Either way, if you like UFO or just want to see what they were all about, this is a great place to start. I recommend it."
5,The Finest Live Album ever!.,"No other live album even comes close to this, Just listen to how tight UFO is live and Michael's playing is Unbeliveable!!. their finist hour by the most underated group in rock history. UFO, should have been huge."
5,Good but not breathtaking remaster of an AWESOME live album,"You can see many other reviews regarding how kick-ass this album is, so I won't go into all that.Instead I'll comment briefly about the remastering job itself:- The added tracks are nice to flesh out the amount of content, though they don't dramatically add to the basic experience.- The sound has been improved, though I would say not dramatically to the casual ear.- Mostly your can hear somewhat better definition of the bass, and a bit more crispness overall."
5,THIS DEFINES WHAT A LIVE ALBUM IS ALL ABOUT,THIS ALBUM ROCKS!THIS IS A PINNACLE ALBUM FOR A BAND THAT REALLY NEVER GOT THE CREDIT THEY SHOULD HAVE.A FULL TILT RIDE FROM THE START OF HOT N READY TO THE END OF SHOOT SHOOT.THE PRODUCTION IS GREAT YET IT STILL SOUNDS LIVE.MANY OF THE SONGS SOUND BETTER HERE THAN THE ORIGINAL STUDIO VERSIONS.STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT RANKS ALONG BESIDE KISS ALIVE AS BEING A CLASSIC LIVE SET.
4,Good Live Document,"If you're looking to get into UFO, a fine 70's British hard rock act, then this is a great place to start. All the essentials are here, especially my favorites ""Rock Bottom"" and ""Too Hot To Handle."" This is another one of those records along with Kiss' Alive, BOC's On Your Feet Or On Your Knees and Rush' All The Worlds A Stage, and Nugent's Double Live Gonzo that will stand the test of time of what a great 70's concert experience was."
5,These Guys should be up with Zeppelin!,"This has got to be one of the best albums of all time. Every single song is filled with awesome guitars, vocals, and lyrics. The first time I listened to this, it quite simply blew me away. I wasn't expecting this from a band I had previously never heard of before. These guys should be hangin' with Led Zeppelin and the rolling stones, not forgotten. Tracks ""lights out"", ""rock bottom"", ""love to love"", and ""shoot shoot"" along with all the rest of them will rock your socks off. You'll be dancing ""out in the street."" STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT ROCKS!"
5,Is it Schenker or the Hand of the Lord?,"Schenker's playing on this record is as good as any music anywhere. The four killer tracks are This Kids, Love to Love, Lights Out, and Rock Bottom. Every now and again, Schenker seems to tap into the divine, and when he does, he's untouchable - as here. But also see Walk on Water, Adventures of the Imagination, The Odd Trio, and Endless Jam Continues. He is just as good now as he was then."
5,"If you like UFO, buy this now","Strangers In The Night is by far one of the best UFO albums. Its a great album, esp. if you're into UFO. If, however, you are just a standard Hard Rock fan this is probably the only UFO CD you ever need. If thats the case, though, you are probably better off with Essential UFO. Bottom line... if you're into UFO and don't have this album, but it now. If you aren't into UFO that much, buy Essential UFO. If you already have this album, but not the ""Expanded Edition"", buy this; ""Hot 'N' Ready"" is worth the extra price alone."
5,Guilty Pleasure,"Not much I can add to the glowing reviews here, except to add that I think this album will also appeal to music fans who don't consider themselves to be heavy metal or hard rock fans. I was never a diehard UFO fan myself, but I heard ""Strangers in the Night"" as a double live vinyl album when it first came out in the late 70s, and I really liked it. A lot. I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane last year, so I ordered the CD and listened to it again to see if I still liked it as much. And I did. I was really surprised at how good this still sounds. I wouldn't even call it metal; it's just good, very good, well played rock & roll with lots of punch, a bit of pop polish, and of course Michael Schenker's biting guitar runs. Play it loud, jump up and down on the sofa, do a few air guitar windmills; it's all good!"
5,Lights out in London,"I bought this album on a prerecorded cassette tape when it was released in England about 1979! I still have it and it plays although its definitely suffering signs of age. It is the best live album I own or have heard, and that includes The Who and U2."
5,exceptional,"This album has defined how a live recording ""should"" sound. Although recorded in 1978, I have yet to hear any live wax that can rival the content, clarity and sound engneering of Strangers in the Night."
5,Joboxer,I am not really a heavy metal fan. I normally listen to alternative rock and jazz. But I used to listen to these songs when I was a teenager and I still love them. All the songs on this album are great - they rock - but they are also tasteful - not overblown.
5,I think it's pretty good,"If you don't like SITN, you must have some malady or deficiency. Basically you're just wrong..........Greatest hard rock ever recorded under any circumstances. I suspect my point has been made."
4,Schenker burns on this live cd!,"Strangers in the night is Micheal Schenker's best recording with UFO. From his blindingly fast sixteenth-note runs in ""Mother Mary"" to the dramatic sting bending break in ""Love to Love"" to his magnificent 10 minute lead blitz in ""Rock Bottom,"" Schenker set his Flying V on fire with his formula for heavy melodic guitar: swift modal runs, twenty-second fret string bends, wah-wah effects, and heavy doses of emotion and drama. Few guitar players of the decade could rival his clean,fast picking and melodic modal phrases. Within the context of heavy metal guitar, this album is a masterpiece."
5,"Pure, classic, live rock and roll","Often listed among the best live rock albums, ""Strangers in the Night"" is a classic performance from UFO that takes you back in time. The clear music lines, the hard rhythms, the euro-rock progressiveness of the 70's are all on display. So much of what we came to love in metal, radio rock, and even popular music can tie itself back to these tunes and these performances. UFO will never get the credit they deserve in the mainstream, but among those who lived it and heard it, we will always know their contributions to the music we were immersed in as teens."
5,One of the greatest rock albums of all time.,"This, without a doubt, is one of the greatest all time rock albums. Even though so few really know of it or appreciate it. I personally haven't heard this album since the early eighties. A real shame it's not played on the radio."
5,Don't pass this one up!,"If you are looking to brush up on your theory, expand your musical vocabulary, or just get some great ideas, this is the book for you. Steve obviously not only knows his stuff but also knows how to communicate his ""wisdom"" effectively and efficiently.Bravo!"
4,Blue Blood,"This is a down and dirty look into the cop on the beat and his move up the ladder to detective. It tells how it really is to work on the NYPD and goes into all the trouble the NYPD had with corruption. The book takes you into what it was like to work the scene of the 9/11 event and more details than you may want to know. All in all its a good book and I believe a true account of police work in the NYPD told by one of the men that should know, he was there. - A good read-Larry Hobson- Author-""The Day Of The Rose"""
5,All I Needed To Know About Being A Cop,"This is a one of a kind book and Det. Conlon is to be commended for writing it. As a writer working on a mystery, it gave me a greater feel for the police department and the people working there. It's first rate and one of the best books I've read about the policing world.Francine Craft"
3,More of a biography than cop stories,"This book is less about cops and robbers and more about the author's family tree. Not that this is a bad thing, it just was not what I was expecting."
2,Too much and not enough,"I won't bore you as long as this book bored me. Conlon spends far to much time reaching back through the generations of his family and not enough time telling us what it was like to be a cop in NYC.It's not a bad book... unless you are looking for a book about what it's like to be a cop in NYC.""Boot"" is a far better book from the point of view of a rookie officer."
3,Somewhat interesting,"This was pretty good, but I had to repeatedly put it down and read other books in-between. My dad's a retired cop, so this was like listening to him tell stories. Well written though."
2,Where's the editor?,"I agree with all the negative reviews of this book.How do you make such a potentially great story into a ponderous, over long and poorly edited book? The author and the editors have succeeded in just that. I also don't understand the favorable professional reviews that the book received. I have found, in general, far more accuracy in the customer reviews published here than in any other source, and will in the future read up here on a book before purchasing.I am trying to imagine the author spending so many hours writing a book like this with so many obvious flaws and not being sent back by any editor worth their salt for extensive cutting, refocusing, and rewriting before rushing this thing into print. Shame on the unscrupulous editors and publisher that let this one get away."
3,"Too long, rambling","I don't know, maybe this book will appeal primarily to police officers.... I thought it went on way too long. A lot of ""navel gazing"" detail, without enough dramatic tension to keep moving the reader forward.Very literate, and the writer certainly knows the terrain. But I had some trouble finishing it."
3,Don't wait for the movie,"Like many other previous commentators, I put Conlon at the pole position on my summer reading list. My initial intent was to evaluate it for possible inclusion as secondary reading in my community college criminal law class. I admit, I was perhaps more process than susbstance oriented because a good war story (of which there is no shortage in this book) needs context if it is to serve my edutainment course objectives.Unarguable is Conlon's gift for the mining the landscape of language and irony. However, I finished the book feeling that the whole was less than the sum of its parts. Conlon failed to capture enough of his own essence in relation to himself (how about a glimpse into the Harvard years???) or his roommate John--not that there's anything wrong with that. It simply deflected any serious consideration for further inquiry, whether it's volume 2 of the memoirs or the made for TV movie."
3,Handbook for NYPD,One wonders how Conlon had time to keep this extremely detailed history of his time on the job in NY. A valuable nuts and bolts look at police work and another angle on 9/11.
2,If you love the New Yorker or need a doorstop . . .,"The New Yorker has always stuck me as a magazine written by and for people who think the everyday minutia of their lives are intensely interesting. Wrong.Edward Conlon has written a memoir of his life as a New York City police officer. Like literally every minute of every day. He drones on endlessly about the crime, corruption, grit, politics and everything else. Interminably.There is no point here: it is the mind numbing recounting of Edward Conlon's life. Not an extraordinary life; not even ultimately an interesting life to anyone other than Edward Conlon. Just the stuff for New Yorker readers and people who found Andy Warhohl's hours long movies fascinating.Conlon however is an articulate man and a solid writer. His subject matter is simply dull.Jerry"
3,Better Like Police Work!,"Parts of this book really sing, and the author can definitely write. But you better be just fascinated with police work, because otherwise you'll go numb. Conlon gives us every possible detail. I'm not sure we need them all."
2,"Interesting but boring, for me.","Overall, I remained ambivalent from page to page about why Conlon wrote the book. At first I thought it was an autobiography, then it was street-cop story telling. At times I was waiting for the obvious announcement of the police administrative corrections that would entirely reform all the past and current corruption inherent in the culture and operations of the NYPD. But that never happened to any traceable or overall effect. So, all in all, for me, it was old hat and boring. I had to force myself to finish reading it. I must say, though, that the effort spent to write it is commendable. Those not ever trying to write and edit those number of pages can't really appreciate how hard it is to keep focused on one encompassing theme. I really didn't care for the family history parts, although obviously having some attitudinal impact on the author. Even though, I believe many outside the NYPD or uninvolved in law enforcement would enjoy the ""story telling."""
2,"Self-Conscious, Artful","Despite some of the rather hysterical reviews for this book on here--both pro and con--I think there is an unmentioned problem that dogs the entire work: it feels contrived. The relentless drumbeat of ""Harvard guy goes blue collar"" that the publisher continues to beat (on the book jacket, no less) renders the entire thing, to me, somewhat suspect. I found myself constantly questioning events, observations, etc., because of the stagey quality of the narrative. One gets the image of the writer putting down his gun in the middle of a street situation in order to take notes for his ostensibly accurate ""tell all."" And there's something intellectually dishonest about that.I'm sorry--I just couldn't trust this book. I think that's the real reason it often feels slow. It comes off more as some sort of writing exercise than a true memoir/discourse on big city policing."
2,"2 Stars for effort and experience, not for writing!","This cop has an awesome story but he drones on endlessly about things that have no importance to his personal story of life as a cop. This book has so much potential but needs to cut about 150 pages out of itself!! Conlon is not really good with words, he is a good cop, though, and for that he deserves 5 stars, his book does not."
2,Bought it for the wife,"Unfortunately she did not like the book. The subject matter is right up her alley, but apparently it was too bland and just not engaging enough."
2,"Boring, long, tedious.","Several insightful reviews here have expanded on the weaknesses of this book and the disappointment that followed its hype-fueled release. They're all right. There's a good, short book screaming to get out of this bloated, rambling, unfocused mess, and Conlon was done a disservice by not having received some criticism (and editing) prior to its publication.I believe Conlon might write a good book one day, but this meandering quagmire between covers isn't it."
3,Hmm...Borderline Boring Because Of The Repetition,"I thought for sure I was going to enjoy this book and parts of it I did. I got tired of hearing the same old things over and over again from him. The history of his family throughout different chapters for no reason didn't make any sense to me. Put it in one or two chapters in the beginning and go on. He described some things in great detail and others he didn't describe at all. Towards the end of the book, I just wanted it over. Mr. Conlon needed an editor to cut out the repetition and the book should have been cut down to about 300 pages or he needed more day to day descriptions or more political stories. If you have the time and the patience then this book may be for you but I don't know that I would read it again."
3,This is a maddening book!,"Blue Blood by Edward Conlon really tried my patience.The book is at least 100 pages too long, and much of the surplusage comes early on. You will learn about every one of Conlon's relatives who became a cop, about movies like The French Connection, Serpico, and the Godfather, and even about forgotten patriot Gouverneur Morris -- and his brother!! Yep, Conlon definitely stayed awake while at Harvard. The man is a walking, talking raconteur and spewer of information.Yet, there is a very good book in here. The stories about Conlon's police work might strike some as repetitive, but what the police do IS repetitive. If they are on the drugs beat, for example, they don't investigate bank robberies. They deal with drugs, day in and day out. So I think he paints an honest picture of police work.Plus, many of his stories are downright hilarious.So, hang in through the early sections, don't be too annoyed by the avalanche of acronyms, and overall you'll enjoy the book."
3,Interesting but too long,"This was an interesting book that could easily have been 100 or 150 pages shorter. There are some great stories. A lot of the scenes that he describes are so similar that they could have been left out. I think at one point that he says that he didn't know of any cops who were corrupt - I'm glad to hear that, because you hear and read so often of cops being on the take."
4,INSIGHT INTO A POLICE MAN'S LIFE,"I had a little difficulty getting into the book because there is so much background information initially. Once you get into the book it is facinating. Most of the police t.v. shows are based on actual stories, I assume. This book is real."
1,Boring,"I was looking foward to reading this book. I'm interested in reading about the Police and Police Departments. This book just kept flipping from Police stories to growing up to examples of Police work that went into real stories with no warning then back a great grandfather and police work back then. Then to top it off who his mother married and her life. It bacame very boring reading. I would be reading thinking to my self ""What is he talking about."" I want to read about Police work and what it's like which the author does write about in between other meaningless information."
2,"personally, i thought the book was lousy","while i have to admit that i got some small bits of entertainment value out of this book, in general i can't think of any term other than 'lousy' to describe it.long passages sound like a bad awards-ceremony speech, over and over listing the names of people he worked with that have no role in this story.he basically 'brushes off' all of the human-rights violations by the nypd, always making excuses for cops that tortured or killed innocent victims.of course the excuses stop at just about all of his former superiors, who were of course all against 'poor him' and therefore clueless, incompetent idiots...the only reason i am giving it 2 stars and not 1 is because of some funny stories that really did make me laugh. (crazy larry's ""you got the aids, bitch"" tops that list.)just my $.02"
1,just say no,"I heard the author on the Jim Bonhanan show and was in complete disbelief as he stonily talked about what a high it was to kick in people's doors and stalk the streets of the South Bronx as a true blue kick-ass. Sure enough there it is, the author, a beneficary of affirmative action at Harvard, buys his upperclass patrons' sweet words and really does believe he has a great story to share for the citizens of the world. Or that he's special because he's a cop and actually knows how to spell. Guess what? It's yet another tired Damon Runyesque-cop-fantasy about walking the mean streets y'hear, what with all the brown dregs out there, being a blue-collar hero so misunderstood (except by the white upperclasses who keep their arms' length while handing out big book deals for a guy so willing to do their questionable bidding). It's tired and boring. Despite the Harvard degree which is apparantly the selling point for this overlong treatise, I found this book dull and depressing."
3,Priceless vignettes; muddled when it comes to the entire body of work,"Conlon's memoir has been a bestseller and was an Amazon.com Breakout Book, so I was excited to dive right in. The early parts of Conlon's career were absolutely fascinating. I learned so much about inner city life in the housing projects (the front-lines look from a beat cop is worth picking up this book for), and I was intrigued by the politics of the job even at the rookie level. As the narrative went on, though, Conlon got bogged down in telling ""the whole story"" with every detail and character and incident. I'm a fan of condensing incidents for readability and narrative style, even if that means leaving out a few facts.Conlon is a terrific writer, and many of his vignettes are priceless on their own. As a whole, thought, the book drags, and could definitely have been condensed by a good editor."
5,LOTS of stories with lots of great information,"This book was mandatory for a class I took on the sociology of policing and I thought it was wonderful. It was extremely long but it had a ton of information on the life of a police officer in New York City. He goes to everything from life before becoming a police officer, to the academy, to the street routine, all the way to promotions and various other units. The book sometimes jumps from story to story with a LOT of background on individuals in the authors families, but it is all worth it. He may have you crying at some points and laughing hysterically at the next and it is well worth the read if you are interested in policing or criminology."
5,Captivating,"I do not regret that I bought this book. It is an interesting book. I like the author's style of writing and the police stories which I found exciting. I generally like cop stories and wasn't disappointed by this. If you ever want to know about the inner workings of New York City and the NYPD, then this is a recommended read with Disciples of Fortune."
3,"Solid, not great","Blue Blood is a good book. Conlon has amazing insight into the world of being a New York City police officer. He takes you deep inside the world of the politics, the prestige, and the power. He eschews a Harvard edcuation and sure fortune as a lawyer for becoming a cop. The book is a good book - but it does not hold together as well as some would like. Good editing may have helped the book fit all of the stories together a bit better. This book is somewhat like a ""Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,"" by David Eggers - just the cop version. That may be a bit of a reach but it has the same post-modern feel to it - not unlike watching a Quentin Tarrantino movie.Now, Tarrantino movies are much better than long disjointed cop books. Again, I do not want to be too hard on this book, it is good - just about 100 pages too long for how much story there was to tell. I found myself drifting in and out of being interested in this book, but overall it was a good read.JVD"
5,The quintessential Cop Story - and I read 'em all!,"Everything about this book works - the writing is as good as it gets, and if cop stuff is your thing - you will love it! I am uniquely familiar with the inner workings of the NYPD, and everything is accurate and free of either embellishment or understatement. It's a history of the NYPD, NYC, and the authors family all in one go. Not the lightest read, definitely takes a little time - but I think in the genre it's gonna take some beating. Good work Mr. Conlon!"
2,I wanted so badly to love this book!!!,"As a wife of an NYPD cop I really looked forward to reading this book. I was first made aware of it by my cousin who also attended Regis HS. When I read the review in the New York Times Book Review I ran out and bought it. After struggling with it for some time I finally finished it. I know way too much about his family, and would have liked the book more if it was WAY shorter and focused more on his career in the NYPD and less on everyone else he ever encountered. I wanted so much to love this book and wound up very disappointed 500+ pages later!! Conlon is a wonderful writer, no doubt, but just wish the book was shorter and more exciting."
2,DULL!,"I'd heard about this book when the author got a big advance. It is exactly what you'd expect. Some lurid police details, but the thing doesn't MOVE. I ended up skimming parts after awhile. The central conceit is that this guy can write, yet is still a cop. While he has some nice descriptive passages, it is too clearly a ""cop diary"" dressed up as work of genuine nonfiction. Comes off as a gimmick. I can't recommend it."
1,I Learn Again Not to Trust Reviews,"I bought this book because of enthusiastic reviews. But, ""blah blah blah"" is right! I wish I could remember which reviewers recommended this book. I want always in the future to do the opposite of whatever they suggest. (Maybe they were among Conlon's many relatives?) How did Conlon get through a Harvard English class? Boring, badly-written book. Sophomoric at best. Waste of money; waste of time. Mr. Conlon do not write again. Please."
2,Blue Blood by Ed Conlon,"Gets off to a roaring start: vivid, full of action, and surprisingly funny. Of course we'll never know if it was the author or his editors who made the fatal decision to pad the rest of the book with all sorts of family history and politically correct nonsense... and he never misses an opportunity to remind us how Progressive he is, a tedious quirk. And by the way, no romance whatsoever. Not a single flirtation. No sex. Nothing. Not one badge bunny throws herself at him! Maybe he wants a career in Leftist circles and refrained from saying anything too colorful. Leaves you with the impression he's a somewhat dreary character, like urban municipal buildings, pigeons, the subway, the color of cement, communism, etc."
1,this is the book that never ends.. yes it goes on and on my friends..,"so, this book got wonderful reviews. big deal. this has to be the most atypical cop book on earth. other police books i've read like ""cop"" by michael middleton and ""what cops know"" were fascinating, exciting and full of knowledge. but this thing... it's about a trillion pages, and the author goes on and on and on and ON about his family history. most authors would talk a little about that stuff, but this guy never stops. i wonder if he should have become a writer instead of a cop, because this guy just NEVER STOPS with the words. he went to harvard, but let's be honest, does some big-time education mean anything on the job? i doubt it. i'm not against descriptive writing, but eventually you need to get to the point, before the reader falls asleep or throws this book in the trash. i don't mean to sound like i have ADD or something, but this one bored me."
5,very good,"the product is the same as it showed in the description, good product, effective in delivering the same, congratulations you keep buying"
2,Mass Tech,"I finished the Mass Tech product in only two weeks, so it does not last very long. It was too quick and too small an amount in the container to really find out if it works. I'm glad I found it online and had a giftcard, because the in-store price is pretty ridiculous for the amount of powder you get and the serviing size (5 scoops!). It's also pretty thick so I can't imagine using this product without a blender. I tried to stir it by hand the first day but it was impossible. I used the blender from then out. Overall, I guess I would only recommend this product to the very rich. Too expensive to buy multiple of these and stick it out to see if it really works or not."
3,Cute,It was a cute movie with not much point.. better for a day your bored. You should definatly rent this movie before you buy it.
1,Extremely bad language,"There was mild cussing and veiled adult themes throughout the film, but what made me take out the DVD and put it in the trash was when KIDS began to use the Lord's name in vain repeatedly. This was done in a comic setting. Wish I hadn't trusted reviewers of this film and bought something so dirty."
2,Beware audio issue-,"If you're upgrading from the DVD version of this movie, a warning- this Blu Ray of Camp Nowhere does not contain a surround sound audio track- it is in DD2.0 mono. Very disappointing to say the least. The video quality is nothing spectacular, but a decent improvement over the DVD when compared side by side. If it came with the proper audio track I would give it a lukewarm recommendation, but since it doesn't I'd recommend it only if surround sound is of no interest to you."
2,could have been good,"There was a possibility of a very good movie here with good acting, talented kids, etc. Unfortunately , as in many kids movies these days, the parents are stereotyped as blithering idiots, and the kids have to go it on their own. The cursing gets out of hand for a family movie, and gets worse as the movie continues. I didn't finish watching it. Christopher Lloyd is great though and it does have it's funny moments ( if you had TV Guardian to block all the foul language that is!)"
4,Very hilarious!,"This movie is great. It is very hilarious and well worth your time. It is almost a five-star movie in my opinion, but I can't give it more than four because some of the scenes are just plain corny and/or ridiculous. And yes, as one reviewer mentioned, the parents are represented wrongly, in that they never suspected anything, which does not seem real.On the other hand, that same reviewer mentioned that he did not finish watching this movie because of cursing. I seriously do not know what he is talking about. I only remember very occaisional and rather mild swearing.All in all, this is a great movie that is definitely worth watching more than once. I definitely recommend at least renting it, if not buying it."
4,Mad-cap family fun,"A clever idea, to produce a new spin on the summer camp movie involving the kids inventing their own camp and conning their unsympathetic parents to part with the necessary cash after they've been hoodwinked by the kids' token ""grown-up"", Christopher Lloyd, in various guises.Some moral lessons, lightly delivered, but the highlight of the movie is Jonathan Jackson's performance, with a young Andrew ably Keegan supporting.The high-speed turnarounds, when the parents come visiting expecting completely different camps, provide an exciting denouement & round off a fun movie for all the family."
5,Great Summer Movie!,"Camp Nowhere, a camp with no meaning to it! After a group of kids realize they have to go to camps they don't want to go to, they decide to meet Dennis (Lloyd) and form their own summer camp. After Dennis fools all their parents into letting them go, word gets around, and over 20 kids end up going! Anyway, it is so funny, and the actors (especially Lloyd in his different characters [The camp councelors and 'Sy Phlerm']) A great comedy that will be enjoyed mostly by kids ages 11-16."
4,funny and fun!,A funny romp about childhood and growing up and being responsible for oneself. This was a really fun movie to watch.
2,guessing it was the original copy..,DVD is playable but it wasn't in as good as condition as advertised and it cant stay in the case so it kinda furthering the problem with the scratching...
5,Childhood,This is a movie I grew up watching and to have it now on DVD still brings me great joy as it did when I was little.
5,Best movie of the summer back then and now!!!!,"I loved this movie!!! I am so happy that I was able to find it on DVD!!! I actually still have it on VHS, but with the advance of technology I need an upgrade!!! This was a GREAT addition to my collection!!!!"
4,Fun film for kids,"This is a really funny movie and perfect for kids since it is a kind of wish fulfillment. None of the kids really want to go to camp, and are being sent there for various reasons (boot camp, fat camp) but they conspire with one another to get themselves sent to a different place with one barely-responsible adult. The kids run amok and have the time of their lives. Some things might be predictable, but it's a good movie, and kids will definitely like it. Adults should get at least a few chuckles from the storyline."
4,recordando a Bolan ?,"Me parece que esta pieza es una reminisencia de lo que era t rex con el fantastico Bolan, es otra muestra mas de como los britanicos se mantienen haciendo discos tributo al glam y todo ese movimeinto de musicos que dio como resultado la vertiente de un rock más urbano, no desmerito en lo mas minimo a supergrass, por el contrario le aplaudo por no querer inventar el agua caliente y tocar con mas dignidad que una gran parte de grupos que no me dicen nada.Si quieren dentenerse en otro grupo britanico interesante entonces haganlo con ellosson otra muestra de que el rock aun vive y que no hay que preocuparse tanto, parece que una nueva version de los 70's esta regresando, esa es la esperanza porque dudo que alguien sea genial en esta decada"
3,Too cutesy for glam...,"As a huge fan of 70's glam, my first listen to this was enthusiastic enough. But on closer scrutiny it reminds me of Spacehog a bit. Retro, but too cool for it's own good. And personally, I like a band to have names and faces; to fit into a context somewhere. This is too quirkily cute to be hard rockin' glam like T.Rex, and too overproduced as well. the problem with modern record producers is they have too many tools at their disposal, and the kitchen sink gets thrown into the mix."
4,More great music,"Having had this album as an import for some time, it is great to see Supergrass get an American release of this album. LOOP has some terrific pop treasures. The opener, ""Za"" rocks with a strong piano beat. ""Seen the Light"" shows that the humor which transcends Supergrass music remains fully in place. ""Grace"" takes its place with the TRex sounds that is infectious. ""Evening of the Day"" is a great song. Yet perhaps the strongest song is ""Run"" a slower, beautiful piece.While this album may not win many converts (although it should), ""LOOP"" is another very strong addition to the Supergrass porfolio. Recommended for those who enjoy British pop at its best."
5,Brilliant,Another superb album from Supergrass. It's more upbeat than their last (and vastly unappreciated) record. I'm just glad they're still around.
3,Did I miss something?,"I really like the Supergrass sound. It's catchy as all hell, sounds like nothing else on the radio yet manages to have a 'classic' sound all it's own. ""Alright"" off ""I Should Coco"" is still one of the great top-down, radio-blaring songs of the last decade.I simply disagree that this is their best work to date. The sound is there but the songs aren't. There's nothing as instantly addictive as ""Pumping On The Stereo"" here. I've listened through it several times now, and the songs are recognizable, but nothing screams ""put me on your semi-annual compilation CD"".I've read so many lavish reviews, I wonder if I've missed something..."
3,"Spacerock, Supergrass style","All the descriptions that 'Life On Other Planets' is well-balanced are pretty accurate...it's definitely one of the better releases of last year. There are a few new twists in this album. Supergrass is going-up the 'global commentary' route, eg, 'Rings Around The World' Superfurry Animals, providing a bit more focus as well as a conscious effort to diversify their songs. There's also a bit of the Flaming Lips influence, quirky, eccentric production noises that tie-in with the space theme of the CD. Although Supergrass is upping the anty, not lost is the trademark cheekiness, swagger, and high-energy rock guitars. Spacerock + Britpop + Supergrass = One of the strongest releases of 2002."
4,Smokin',"In these days of bulging egos, its nice to find a group that seems happy being a group. Like their British cousins Gomez (and strikingly unlike their British cousins Oasis), Supergrass down play their individuality to the extent where the members names or roles are not even mentioned on the cd. As they have on their previous albums, but with far more consistency, Supergrass present catchy, playful, mostly upbeat tunes that pay homage, primarily, to British bands of an earlier era--T Rex, The Kinks, Mott the Hoople, The Specials, and, yeah, yeah, yeah, The Beatles. Blending guitars and gizmos, both electric and acoustic, with cool harmonies, this music would sound exceedingly good emanating from the car radio, if only radio played this kind of stuff anymore."
5,Every Tune an Earworm,"Seems to me I heard this release was his response to a great Bill Monroe release. Every tune here is a joy. For a mandolinist, adding any of these to the repertoire will have people running up and asking, ""Who wrote that?"" Recommended with no caveats at all."
3,Review from GRAPEVINE magazine,A Garden in Lucca is bound to give pleasure to anyone who loves Lucca in particular and Tuscany in general. Readers who have lived in Lucca for some years may also get an added frisson from recognising some of the characters who appear in the book.
3,Marred by gratuitous cattiness,"Surely it was unnecessary to ridicule the summer tennants'sloppy habits the previous owners' bad taste and the prospective buyers'personal life. These instances, quite apart from being totally irrelevant to the main theme of the book, introduce an element of shallowness and caricature to an otherwise sensitive and thoughtful book."
2,AN ITALIAN TRANSFORMATION,"The other reviews I read before I got this book were just great so my anticipation was high on reading this. I stopped the whole thing at page 75. Why? There were so many foreign words used (Italian & French) that they got in the way of comfortable reading for me. This couple ""bet the store"" that they would make their move to Italy successful...and they did. I must pass on this book."
5,Back to Amazon to order a second one,"I was a little skeptical about this fan at first because of its small size, but I ended up loving it. I have no idea why other reviewers had such a hard time putting it together--it's certainly no worse than any other fan I've ever assembled and installed myself. 30 minutes and it was all done. Only problem is, I put it up in a room that has two fans and now I need another one to match it. Buy it--can't beat the price and the lifetime warranty!"
2,be aware,"Nice fan quiet and modern looking..... BUT, if you break the glass globe you won't be able to find a replacement!!!!!"
4,"Good Fan, litle wobbly out the box",I installed one of these fans in my bathroom (which has a window) and it works great. I hooked it right up to the light switch so when the light is on the fan is on (or you can pull chain it). lightbulb was not standard and wouldn't accept a compacr fluorescent due to size.
1,I'd Suggest Staying Away From This Fan,"First.... I can't agree with others here in regards to ease of assembly. I am mechanically inclined, but I still think that it shouldn't be too tough for an average Joe as long as they know the difference between a regular and a phillips head screwdriver. But I'd suggest that it's a moot point. I'm very disappointed in this fan. I may have just gotten a bad one, but it's noisy and not balanced particularly well, to the point of it being practically unusable at night even on a low speed. And the fact that it's relatively pricey adds insult to injury in my opinion (similar size fans are available at Lowe's or Home Depot for much less money, though I'll admit that they're not quite as modern looking). I should have returned it, but I knew that I wouldn't use the fan that much, and the thought of disassembling it, re-packing it, and paying to ship it back was enough to keep me from doing just that. I'd suggest looking at a different fan."
2,Better be able to build the fan,This product is good for a small fan however it takes and extreme amount of time to put together and is very complicated. Unlike other fans on the market it should be rated as difficult to assemble.
3,Made in Thailand,I haven't tried these yet. They might be amazing. But the only other review when I bought them said they were made in Japan. The box I received was made in Thailand.
4,A nice book.,"This book was fine, and tells all the rockets and rocket launches, space shuttles, the landing on the moon and a whole lot more stuff. I would have gave this book 3 and a half stars if I could but since you can't use half stars on Amazon.com I decided to use 4 stars."
4,Eyewitness Space Exploration,"The Eyewitness Space Exploration is a good book. Did you ever wonder how it would be to be an astronaut? Or how long to train for the journey? To find out these answers, read this book."
4,A Young Boy's Imagination,"I purchased this toy for my 5 year old son, who has recently become a fan of TMNT. He love's them! I do too. Watching the movies together is great fun. He plays with his action figures while watching Leo, Raph, Mike & Don fight off the bad guys. Although pricey, the figures (I have purchased, Leo, Donatello & Michaelangelo so far) are very durable and a good size. Definitely a collector's item!"
5,bang for your buck,"I actually purchased this product to repair my reel lawnmower handle. I compared several and went with this one as it seemed like it might be more cushiony than others, came in black, and was a three-pack for a mere $5. I am very pleased. It is not that thick, in case you are worried about that on your tennis racket. It is smooth, yet the rubberiness gives it traction. No problem mowing the lawn with sweaty hands. Two grips combined for the perfect length the wrap my mower handle (about 26"" long of 1.5"" diameter). I was skeptical that the adhesive tape included would hold well, but it does! I even had one wrap left, which I used to cover the handle on my sons' foam bat (the foam was coming off). Worked like a charm there too, and they love it. Makes it look more ""real"" too!Great deal for a small price. Happy wrapping."
1,Slips,Feels pretty good at first but started slipping like crazy when I started sweating. Had to towel off after every point or watch the racket fly out of my hand.
2,Disappointing,"Some of the songs in this collection are good, but a lot of it is like mariachi Muzak - treacly orchestra arrangements of mariachi tunes. Try other collections of Mariachi Vargas, but not this one, unless you want some pseudo-mariachi to play in your supermarket.Also, I would expect some information about the music and the recordings in an antología. Here there are only song names and composers. For a group with such a long history, I expect to be told when these tunes were recorded."
2,This CD Stinks,"I am an Elvin Bishop fan--yep, I loved Pigboy Crabshaw and In My Own Dream, and a ton of his bootleg live albums out of California and the Fillmore West. They are blues oriented good time music. This CD stinks.Lets take ""He's a Dog"" by way of example, a complete waste of several mega bites of ones and zeros on this CD, a song about a dog that rolls around in the dirt.Now maybe I should have been drunk to understand the concept of this song, and having listened to it sober, I feel I am the worse for the experience.If you like good Elvin Bishop blues and a really good time, buy ""Rasin' Hell"", a terrific CD and a really good time, and stay clear of this, unless of course, you are drunk."
2,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""IF ELVIN TOLD HIS BISHOP ABOUT HIS VOICE, HE'D GET THE BLUES!""","Periodically, Elvin Bishop is involved in a discussion about blues. Well on this CD, there is no blues discussion, with or without Elvin. His voice, which was never top notch to begin with, hasn't aged well. He has fallen so far from ""Fooled Around And Fell In Love"", (Even though he didn't do the singing.) it's ridiculous. I had earlier, bought a CD of Elvin's, with his mentor, Little Smokey Smothers, where they talk about Elvin's early blues lessons, and though neither of them had a voice to write home about, they had some fun with the crowd. (I would write a review for ""Shaq's, The King Of The World Blues Reviewer's"" loyal fans, but I can't find it on Amazon.) This CD is a total, dismal, disappointment, for anyone looking for an electric blues CD."
4,Elvin Bishop..... the return,"I remember the recordings that Elvin Bishop made with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band very well,where he proved to us that he really knew how to play the guitar.After many years Bishop has returned with more proof,where you can breath the blues,and where he confirms all his talent.The pieces are all very good,with ''What the Hell is going on'' and ''Come on Blues'',Elvin Bishop has produced a solid and pleasant sound all at the same time.''Gettin' my groove back'' is a recording that to me considered ''listen to believe''.In conclusion,it is a recording realized with lots of passion an sentiment,something very rare today."
3,Good to have around,"I would have preferred Earnie Ball , Fender ,or any name brand, but none weren't available in bulk.. I bought 10's 13's & 17's . of these Rogue's. to have for an emergency . I don't recomment Rogue products ."
5,"Review Monarch of the Glen, Series 5 & 6","Excellent series. Now am in possession of entire series 1 - 7. Show projects an enjoyable, comfortable, humorous depiction of contemporary life of a Scotish Laird."
3,Heavy Machinery Accident Reconstruction,"most of the book deals with earth moving and heavy machinery, that is the author's experience.http://cummingseng.com"
2,Confusing Stream-of-Consciousness,"I have read several of Mahfouz's books, and in my opinion, this is NOT one of his best. I do not enjoy stream-of-consciousness writing. We read this book in our bookclub, and several of us found his writing style very confusing, necessitating continual re-reading to find out who is talking, and about whom, and to whom. Nevertheless, the book is full of psychological implications, as it is four character's viewpoints about the same people and incidents. This is Mahfouz at his worst, and most confusing. If you want to read Mahfouz at his BEST, read instead The Cairo Trilogy. The first book in that trilogy is one of the best books I have ever read, and that one is not written in the stream-of-consciousness style."
2,Be prepared to buy a new one every so often,"Whatever material or coating this is made from is softer than warm plexiglass.I've used this filter for about two weeks now. It certainly did a fine job protecting my lens from dust and such (like any filter would). However, when I was cleaning it I couldn't get a piece of lint off the glass. I VERY gently tried to remove the lint with my finger and my fingernail scratched the glass...Are you kidding?This filter is marketed as a lens-protector. You'd think it could stand up to more than a fingernail without being permanently damaged. This is like buying a pair of gloves and having them fall apart the first time you use them.At $15, at least this was a cheap mistake."
5,One of the funniest books ever written!,"This drop-dead hysterical book consists of a decades long correspondence between two men.The father of a young boy who wanted to go frog hunting started the ball rolling by writing a tongue-in-cheek letter to his local state legislator regarding a quirk in the state law regarding 'the taking of frogs with a stick'. The legislator responded in kind, and the war of letters escalated. Over the years, the correspondence took on a life of its own, stoked by two people writing riotously funny letters in a deadpan style. This is one book that you will keep on your shelves long after you have read it and reread it"
2,Overrated,An overly wrought rememberance of a tongue in cheek contretemps between two sweet people in the public domain.
5,vera wang bc,"arrived on time and packaged well,I usually wear Giorgio BH or Chanel,but thought I would try this after reading some reviews,,,got to admit I think it will become one of my favorites"
3,"Good for fish, bad for clarity","Fish seem to be brighter and healthier looking after soaking pellets in food for 3 weeks. Too bad the stuff also clouds the water, making it harder to see how pretty the fish are."
4,Symmetry is they,Monk and Coltrane bring a blend of soul and cool to a likable presentation of many of their favorites. I am glad they did it and I am glad I have it.
3,Item was okay,"I purchased this as a gift for my niece and was a little saddened that there were price stickers on the front of cover from Deseret Industries and they won't come off without ruining the cover. Other than that, I'm glad I ordered this for her. It'll replace her old one. Thank you!"
5,Great Product,"This product works great, I've had it for a couple of months, and it has worked as described. No problems. I have Windows XP, and an older lap top (2002?). Works great."
4,Works Well With My Linksys Wireless Router,"It took awhile, but I was successful getting this wireless adapter to work in my old Windows 98SE IBM ThinkPad. The software is nicely compatable with my Linksys wireless router so I was able to use WAP encription instead of WEP (which is so easy to hack these days). The very small antenna on this PCMCIA card is sufficient to pick up a good signal anywhere in our 2 story home. (My wireless router is in the basement.)"
2,"Easy to use, poor range","The installation was a breeze and using the software is easy, however the range seems to be very lacking. I bought this product for my finacee to use primarily at my home where I have a D Link wireless router with one of those range extending antennas. My laptop with an internal card gets a strong signal and quick internet anywhere in my house, however her computer using this card gets only a very weak signal or no signal at all in most of the house until she gets within about 10 to 15 feet of the router. The signal only 25 feet or so away from the router is so weak that it takes gmail about 5 minutes to load the inbox, if you move closer in then it works much faster. I also have an Xbox 360 with the Xbox wireless adapter set up on the opposite side of the house of the router and it also gets a strong signal."
2,problems,"It has not been working well, I dont wheteher it's a problem in my computer or somehting wrong with the product"
1,Junk,The useful range on this card is less than 30 ft. Ridiculous. At 20 ft it is barely functional.
5,Works like a champ,Installed CD then card on XP with no problems. My only issue is that it appears to like only to use the Linksys monitor software instead of the Windows XP Wireless one. Recommend purchase if you are using older 11b.
1,Worthless junk,"This product is of no value. It did not work on to different laptops, a Dell and a Compaq. This is after Linksys sent me a replacement to the original that did not work."
4,Linksys WPC54G wireless card- works like a charm,I set up a new home network around 2 months ago- adding a laptop to my network. The linksys wireless card works flawlessly.
4,WPC54G white box new as advertised,"The wireless adapter arrived on time in a white box as advertised, and as far as I can tell it is new and never used.It works fine, but is a little fussy about connecting to my network at times. After reinstalling the software and two chat contacts with Linksys tech support I think I have the problem worked out. The problem was with the encryption key. I can't say enough good things about Linksys tech support. Unlike other vendors I've worked with, their tech folks know their stuff and can resolve problems very quickly."
3,Humourless and revolting,"Humourless and revolting, but that's not to say unworthy. Genuinely unattractive and filled to the brim with unpleasantness which can be interesting in the right setting, but Homes is too po-faced with her narrator. The story lacks the satire of that other tasteless epic, American Psycho. At least The End of Alice wasn't written by a man or we'd never hear the end of it. A fair effort at sustaining a narative by a sympathetic monster who can only tell lies. Two days after finishing the book I began to wonder if any of his flashbacks were true even in the baths with his mother."
4,"Sick, disturbing, but intelligent","I would never read this book again, it turned my stomach, made me want to throw up, and had me wanting to skip scenes in the book. That said, I believe the book is a work of genius, sick genius, but genius none the less. I think the way it's told, gives a literary quality, and the way the story unfolds does it justice as well."
2,OVER HYPED,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I thought it was going to be shocking and frightening, but it was just a tedious read. I found several parts to be rather grotesque, but nothing in this book conveyed to me the real mindset of the killer. If you want a TRULY good book on man/child lust......try Lolita."
3,I threw this book in the trash after getting about 1/5 of,"the way through it. This book is not pretty. Which I applaud the author for, because it clearly was not meant to be. If you think you have the stomach for it, by all means, give it a read. But consider yourself warned."
3,Absorbing yet Disturbing.,"The End of Alice by A.M. Holmes is excellently written yet increadibly disturbing. In the tradition of Nabokov, the reader is taken into the mind of a self-confessed pedophile who is languishing in jail.Holmes writes so well that one cannot seem to put the book down regardless of the repulsion the book incites. It is disturbing because her prose seduces you into wanting more of something you don't want.Though an intelligent piece of work, I only give it a six because I was left with a queasy, unconmfortable feeling at the end of the book.If I had to give an analogy of what it felt like to read The End of Alice, I would say that it's as comfortable as chewing on a blade."
1,nothing new or spectacular,"a note of warning, when hearing the words ""shocking"", ""spectacular"", ""erotic"" and the likes from the literati, immediately flee to the next book. Such was the case with a little known French piece (baise moi) and likewise holds for this book. Overall the book stinks of an academic exercise whereby the thin skins of its characters are loosely fitted to their phantom haunches. Not a difficult read in particular or hard to follow - very dry and flat. Go to the masters instead: houellebecq, ballard, selby, bataille, nabokov."
2,Give me a bucket,"...Let me say that you will only enjoy this novel if the idea of pedophilia--and the advancement of pedophilia--arouses you in any way. I read with one eye closed, afraid to read the each successive paragraph for fear of what would happen next. It's one thing to dislike a character or two in a novel, it's another thing to despise all of them.I am giving the book 2 stars (instead one) only because it is written fairly well. But the disgust factor knocks the rest of the stars out of there."
4,a disturbing page turner,"The End of Alice was just one of those books... it was hard to swallow but I still wanted to nevertheless. The vivid scenes that were depicted put knots in my stomach but I was always intent to go on and besides, it was made interesting conversation on the transit."
3,"Gripping, Disturbing, Horrifying, Erotic in the worst way.","(...)I got this for the squick factor--the need to be shocked and the need to have a hard core, descriptive and graphic read. And that is what I got. Beneath the meandering, flowery and wordy prose is a story that shocks, horrifies... It was like a car wreck with visible fatalities; horrible yet you cannot draw your eyes away from this carnal, gory mess laid out for you.It is a twisted sort of love story; between both our nameless inmate and the co-ed writing him, and also between Alice and her 'man'. It comes to a steam-of-consciousness end that I could not put down... And don't think about crawling into bed with your lover for a couple of nights, once you're done with it. The imagery lingers and so does the bad aftertaste it leaves in your mouth."
2,"Gratuitous, sensationalized trash","Never before have I read a book and felt the urge to destroy it. This is the most gratuitous and disturbing book to be released in years. The author attempts to recreate the evocative prose of Nabakov's Lolita (one of the best novels ever written) but fails miserably. This is, quite frankly, sensationalized trash. The only reason I give it a 3 is to acknowledge the utter nerve it took to write it."
1,The End of Alice,"I don't know how anyone can compare this pulp fiction to Lolita. The End of Alice has none the grace or poety of Nabokov's tragic novel. I found this book as gratuitous as a summer block buster movie. I wanted to like this book I realy did, but unfortunately it rambled on and on feeding me more than enough graphic depictions of jailhouse sex and keeping me up to date with the disgusting habits of twelve year old boys (I really don't think the scab scene was called for, it made me retch). To top it off the ending was a complete bore. I'm sure evey pedophile in the country loved this book. The author was young when she wrote this and it shows."
4,"depraved, but....enertaining.....","i, honestly, am not a moral person. but this book is simply the most shocking thing i have ever read. yes, comparasions to nabakov are valid, but ""lolita"" was nothing, nothing at all like this. the storyline is enough to provoke some uneasy feelings, but the writing itself is a whole other thing. i honestly kept the book off for a while because of it.however, the narrative and detail are stunning. incredibly stunning. one would think it would be on the same level as some patended supermarket trash novel, but it's nowhere near it. it moves briskly, is accessable, and weaves the storyline masterfully.so, overall: good book, but disturbing amorality/depravity/whatever you like to call it can often lead to less-than-favorable thoughts of the book."
2,A very violent and disturbing novel,It was a very hard novel to keep reading due to the subject matter. Graphic sex and the ending was shocking. Would not read anything else by this writer.
4,The writing is strong and the story is compelling,"THE END OF ALICE follows two people: the main character , an imprisoned, middle-aged pedophile/murderer and the secondary character, a nineteen-year-old girl who writes to him and plans to seduce a twelve-year-old boy. I found this book on a list of ""disturbing books."" I believe that I can stomach anything, but at three instances I was about to put this book down and abandon it. It's hard to read. It explicitly details prison life, pedophilia, and sexual obsession. I had the feeling that a skinned corpse was in front of me, because nothing's left to the imagination in this novel. The writing is strong and the story is compelling, so I stuck it out to the very end."
2,What for?,"Why was this a bestseller, given all the important and intellectually engaging books out there? This book is unimportant--it's only possible importance being that it makes me worry about those walking among us who made it a bestseller.Perhaps I should instead only fear decisionmakers at publishers, and at distributors like QBPC and BOMC that made ""Alice"" a featured selection. That's the thing that ""hooked"" me--buying into a commercial blurb about some groundbreaking and important literary coup--and made me, too, one of the scary multitudes who propelled this waste of time to financial and popular success.I read much of this as ""sex is boredom,"" and the repeated descriptions of masterbation and similar sexual release bored me and distressed me at the same time. Homes is a fine wordsmith, so why does she, so to speak, ""spill her seed"" over and birth such an impotent waste of a read as ""Alice?"""
1,Worst Book I Have Ever Read In My Life,"This is the most revolting, disjointed, lean story there is. It seems to me that the author relies heavily on shock and leaves the story bare and lean. There is no story really, the end is the worst, it just leaves you wondering what all of this disjointed crap was all about. The few hours I spent reading this book are a precious few hours I will never get back again. I think alot of people read this book based on the idea that it is dark and there is a secret eroticism in pedophilia but I am telling you if you are looking for dark eroticism buy some erotica and stay far away from this book. This is the only book in my life I will burn."
1,I wish I could purge the memory of this book from my mind,"This is simply the most disgusting book I have ever read. I am not a prude; I can usually read about kinky and depraved sex. I can even handle the pedophilia in this book, it's kind of interesting to see what is going on in the mind of a pedophile. But the graphic, sadistic, rape scenes are just too far. Unfortunately the book is very well written and I might never get those scenes out of my mind.I really can't imagine anybody liking this book unless they have major issues themselves."
3,You have to wonder...3 1/2 stars,"...The premise of this book is weird--a 19 yr old girl with a crush on a 12-yr-old boy writes to a man who raped and killed little girls. Not exactly the same animal, but she claims to identify with him. More on the girl and less on the killer might have made the book more interesting (and less disgusting). It is well-written and worth reading, if you like horror-type stuff, but be warned."
1,undeserving of the Nabokov comparison...,"...but given the shared subject matter, I suppose the comparisons are inescapable. Having said that, Lolita is lyrical, poetic, humbling. This is just drivel. A pedestrian attempt to shock the unsuspecting masses with tales of prison rape and --wait for it-- scab eating. The writing style quickly grows tiresome and taxing, and since there is no story, no character development, no overarching theme, and (surprise, surprise) no conclusion, I had a hard time fininshing it. It is very had to care about anyone in this story, be they good or bad. And the writing about the sex is funny in a way I'm sure wasn't intended (""Bad Sex in Fiction"" award?)Anyway, if you want to be shocked and delighted at the same time, read Fermata by Nicholson Baker, or if you just want to be shocked, de Sade's Justine."
1,One of the worst,This is absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read. Avoid it. It's banal and is bascially about pedophilia but doesn't have any redeeming qualities about it.
4,There is no daylight in this book,"I read this book in two days. I could not put it down, it was gripping but also repulsive. There is no daylight in this book, all the characters are twisted, sad and lonely. The peodophile's correspondence with the 19 year old girl is particularly disturbing - is her behaviour with the 12 year old boy just something she does to be rebellious, or is she really an emergent peodophile? Is it just part of her growing up process? Her parents have no idea what is going on. Well written but sometimes too sensational - in parts it reads like a Black Lace novel. I give it four stars."
2,cheap,item broke within a two days and the charger piece was too small and barely touched the inner charging port of the phone
5,What's not to like?,"Like I said, what's not to like with this fine little charger. I lost mine and the battery was getting low on my Tungsten. Just on price alone I'd order it and did. Arrived promptly with the standard shipping and I it works perfectly. Even looks like the original but it has one feature the original doesn't . . . a LED that shows operation.A couple of days ago I found the one I lost in the back of the glove box of my car. Now I have two but glad to have this one. Nice little unit. Best buy I've ever made on Amazon. Really."
3,Fast Delivery.. low quality product,The product was delivered very fast but is a low quality product made in China. Gets a little heat up after a couple of hours of use. Other than all is great.
3,Not best quality,I bought this over a year ago to bring into my office to plug in there. A few weeks ago I changed offices and went to unplug it and one of the prongs got stuck in the outlet! Cheap crap! Oh well - I'll just buy another one....
2,Treo Wall Charger,This charger creates static on the AM radio when using the same electrical outlet circuit. I need to move the charger to a different outlet not on the same circuit. Inconvenient!!!
4,It works,I've a Treo 700P. What's to say? It Works. It is not as heavy duty as the original (which I still have in service) but I wanted another one as a backup.
1,Backup Charger,Thought the price was outstanding...they (the company) play the game like e-Bay. They get you on the shipping. The product runs hot when plugged in...I feel the item burning out soon. If you just need a backup unit go for it!
1,"Do not purchase, broke after 4 days","The Palm Centro Battery Charger was shipped and received in a very short time. We were very happy about it since the phone was completely run down. However, after about 4 uses the charger STOPPED working. Do not buy this charger it is a piece of junk."
4,Good,"Works fine with my Sprint Centro, and cheap. Would prefer a charger w retractable prongs, but this does the trick for a spare charger at work."
5,"Good Product, Good Price","Product works as expected. Good Price. Shipped promptly. Only negative opinion is the cord is a bit short for my application, though I figured it would be..."
2,written by a teen looking for good audition monologues,"When I looked this book up, I understood from the reviews that it was full of wonderful monologues perfect for teens. I found almost all of them fairly stereotypical and pointless. I would call them ""wish monologues"". They wish they were monologues. Although it's a great idea, this book was a huge disappointment to me and I would not recommend it to any teen looking for audition material."
5,A must have for any child actor!,My son is a professional child actor and he has many of Chamber Stevens books! We find all of his books to be of a great use to practice his skills in regards to monologues and scripts! Chamber's books are a necessity in our home and will be through our son's teenage years! This book is great on all levels...from a actor just getting started to a actor with many credits with their name. Chamber's creativity is off the charts as is his books...if only I could give it more than 5 stars!
2,Not for Serious Young Actors!,My 12 yearl old daughter needed a monologue for a Talent Competitions and thought this might have great monologues for her age group. It does NOT.. Don't get me wrong has cute monologues for beginners but not for competition stage. Great for 5 to 8 yr olds but not for much older. Especially if taking acting seriously.
2,Not So Magnificent,I found these monologues to be too simplistic and too short in length to be used as material for our Forensics competitions. They could be fine for those wanting short material for practice or classroom experience.
5,Child of the Holocaust,"I haven't read this book in probably 25 years, but it is a part of who I am today just the same. I still vividly remember certain events and even remember parts of some sentences from it. Having always loved books, I read the first addition of Jack Kuper's memoir when I was about 10 years old, after picking it up from a used book dealer. It made lasting impacts on my young mind. This book was part of how I came about rejecting the racist views held by my family. I'm grateful to Mr. Kuper for having shared such painful but powerful memories."
4,Appears to have all necessary ingredients for bone health,"After doing much reading about how the body assimilates calcium and other minerals/nutrients, it appears that Bone Restore has everything to make calcium the most available for our systems. A friend had recommended it to me because her sister told her about and after she took it for 2 years her doctor told her that her bone loss had been reversed. Whether that has happened for me yet, I don't know."
1,bad product.,"every product with calcium and/or d3 must havevitamin k2 - or the calcium will go into yourarteries, not your bones.search amazon books for ""k2"" and read the comments.i find that amazon book's comments are an excellentway to learn about everything before you google.we are all deficient in k2 and a k2 deficiency isvery very bad.lef should know this; jarrow makes a good mk7 k2.this is a good product, if you supplement with k2."
2,Life Extension Bone Restore,"I was not too pleased with this product. I didn't realize I had to take 5 tablets/day. It didn't seem to do muchfor my bone density, calcium intake or osteoarthritis. I probably will not order again."
3,THIS BOOK WAS KINDA BORING!,"NOT AS FUNNY AS I THOUGHT AND PEOPLE LOOK AT ME CRAZY WHEN I'M READING IT AND I'M LIKE 'HEY, I'M NOT THE RACIST! IT'S THE BOOK!'YO EGO TRIP, YOU ARE TRIPPING WITH THIS BOOK (NOT REALLY BUT I WANTED TO SAY THAT!)NOT AS GOOD AS YOUR OTHER CLASSICS!!!!!!"
1,Only if you want a cheap laugh,"Complete garbage. There are some people who will put out anything Jimi ever played on just to make a buck. Jimi took a four track with him everywhere, so almost every jam was recorded. Thre are bootlegs that are a 1000 times better than this. He had an off night, and an obliterated Jim Morrison grabs the mike and screams obscenities. If you want to hear a deranged Lizard King buy this CD for a laugh. Otherwise, I reccomend you avoid it."
3,Die hards will enjoy this,"Yes, this album is a technical piece of crap. it was probably made from tape that somebody stole from jimi and made money off of. Wether or not this recording is legitimate, it shows jimi where he did best: late night jams at some club, probably heavily under some influence. In this one, jimi is playing above average compared to what else i've heard, and on track 4, Uranus Rock, Jim morrison comes along and starts wailing, and in the next track he screams profanities, although he is smothered by whoever mixed the CD. Also, i think one of the tracks is used twice, and one of the tracks can't possibly be by jimi. despite all the comebacks, this is a great recording, especially for the $5 I paid for it. if you're a real hendrix fan, go for it."
4,A first rate security book ..,"This is an excellent reference for either today's NT sysadmin concerned about security or the seasoned security profressional looking for a compact NT reference for his or her shelf. Well organized and easy to read, this is the book I wished I had available when designing our NT4 deployment.The Windows 2000 section is on the light but many of the same points the book discusses about NT4 are easily leveraged to Windows 2000.All in all, a solid reference."
5,Very cute and soft,This is the cutest Koala I have ever seen. Hes so so soft and easy to make. Comes with a birth certificate and 2 stars. I would buy him for anyone who loves Koalas.
5,Live Bluegrass At Its Finest,"Simply one of the best two live bluegrass albums ever recorded. The Johnson Mountain Boys cover every facet of what a fan could hope to experience at a bluegrass show. Soaring vocals, blazing instrumentals, classic covers, stirring gospels and great original material mixed with the in-between-song banter that, more than any other performers, bluegrass folk seem to be so good at.Favorites included ""Body and Soul"" (Dudley Connell's vocals are off the chart here - just incredible), ""Long Journey Home"", Weathered Gray Stone"", ""Let The Whole World Talk"" and ""I've Found a Hiding Place"" (great vocal harmony here).Wondering what the other ""best"" live bluegrass album is? That would be The Johnson Mountain Boys ""Live at the Birchmere"" released about 5 years earlier than this one. Only two or three of the same songs are included on both albums so its like getting an entirely different show. Get them both - you won't be sorry!"
2,Limited Selection--Incomplete,"This anthology comes off rather badly in comparison to ENGLISH RENAISSANCE DRAMA: A NORTON ANTHOLOGY edited by David Bevington. Missing in action are Tamburlaine and The Jew of Malta by Marlowe, The Tragedy of Mariam by Elizabeth Cary, The Alchemist by Ben Jonson, The Maid's Tragedy by Beaumont and Fletcher, The Roaring Girl by Middleton and Dekker, Women Beware Women by Middleton, and The White Devil by Webster--classic works all."
1,Not Bassets,Not anywhere as tasty as the original Bassetts Jelly Babies! As a knock-off they will do if you can't find a reputable importer of the real thing!
5,My British mother loved them!,My mom is from London (WWII bride). She loved these as a birthday gift. Said they were very sweet and tasty.
2,Bad formatting on smaller Kindle devices,"I got this for my Kindle rather than a bulky book to save on space, and I wish I'd just paid the couple of dollars extra to get a real copy. The formatting on many of the coding examples is TERRIBLE and what's even worse is some examples actually have text cut off! I've just wasted 20 minutes trying to find a link to notify Amazon of the problem without any luck which makes it even more frustrating. This book doesn't seem to be marked as ""optimized for larger devices"" and regardless, it's unacceptable that meaningful text is lost."
2,Not nearly as good as I was led to expect,"In my view, this book tries to be both tutorial and reference but fails at both. I can find better, more complete, and more accessible reference material in 10 seconds with google. Whenever I open this book to find information about some aspect of the STL, I end up googling for the same information a few minutes later.The examples are near useless. They are all minimal examples of basic functionality and offer no help in using the library for real-life tasks. They do show you which header files to include, which is a plus.Hash maps are completely left out of the book. While not officially part of the stl, they are still a significant part of it, and one that requires more explaining than the rest.I am to understand the +5 reviews were because there are no better books on this subject, similarily my +2 review is because there are not enough negative reviews of this book."
2,Lacks depth,"This book does not even mention the use for some items that are integral to correct C++ usage, such as multidimensional vectors. It is not the book you will go to to find answers. It could be good as a primer on STL."
3,English is terrible,"English is not my native language, but even I found the English translation of this book is poor.Sometimes the author tried to explain something that should be helpful, but he stopped right before the point that you could fully understand it."
5,Indispensable reference,"This book is comprehensive,well written with plenty of sample code.It covers the standard STL(excludingextensions such as hashed containers),the IOStream library and there arechapters on Internationalization and Allocators.It clearly distills the design philosophy,shape and common usage patterns of the STL.Should you wish to merely lookup syntax, orwish to clarify a subtlety, you'll find it here.Highly recommended for every C++ programmer."
5,Belongs on every programmer's desk,"Before we begin, let me just say: this book is exceptional. It belongs on every C++ programmer's desk.Nicolai Josuttis' book fills a crucial need--exploring every corner of the C++ libraries recently adopted as part of the C++ language standard. While other books have covered this before (or portions, such as the STL), none are as current or as detailed. Josuttis focuses on how to use the standard library to its fullest, and explains the smallest details crisply and logically. The coverage is not limited to the STL, although that makes up the bulk of the book. For example, it contains extremely detailed information about Internationalization, covering every facet of, well, facets.To use a hackneyed expression, this book is an ""instant classic"" of the C++ literature. Buy it. Read it."
2,Not a convenient reference,"I was looking for a programmers reference for the standard template library and generic algorithms; one to sit on my knee to help me utilize more of the convenience and power in standard c++. This book does perform that task, but the translation makes the text a bit choppy,not a pleasant read for an English speaker. The chapter organization also demands rather too much flipping back and forth. For instance, Josuttis has separated the material on iterators from the template classes that utilize the iterators. I also don't like the code examples very much. Although they do illustrate the use of the templates and iterators, they are the minimum necessary to get by. They don't suggest the possibilities like Lippman's book, ""C++ Primer"" does. I would suggest anyone purchasing Josuttis' book also purchase Lippman, ""C++ Primer""."
4,Poor paper quality,The paper quality of the book is bad.I read 120 pages so far and like the tutorial style.
4,The C++ Standard Library written by N. M. Josuttis,"This book will serve well as an important reference to the ANSI/ISO C++ Standard Library. It is well suited for C++ programmers of all capabilities for not only explaining the library elements, but also giving well explained, in depth insight to the workings of the code and the theory behind the concepts used throughout the book. Well written and very intellectual, Josuttis does well explaining the design with examples that enhance C++ beginners through experts knowledge of the entire library."
5,The best of the bread.,"This is probably the best book on the C++ standard library. Other authors books a also excellent, highly recommend. You will not regret buying this book."
2,The kindle version is not good,Luckily I downloaded the sample version before buy.The codes are using the same font of the rest of text and they are sometimes mixed with the rest of text.Try this book before buy to see if you like the way it is formatted.
5,The C++ Standard Library..The standard book you should have!,"If you are learning C++ or an experienced programmer, this book is for you.The book takes off where a lot of introductory texts leave off, and explains what is going on with library function calls etcetera.Not only does the book explain the calls, it also gives a history on C++ and describes the development of the library and language, so AT LAST you understand WHY certain things are implemented the way they are.Of particular note is the excellent (and understandable)coverage of STL and templates which will finally allow the reader to produce better more flexible code, utilising techniques that are properly explained for a change!This is not just a book it is hardcovered empowerment, the subtitle A tutorial and reference describes it well!"
4,"I use it a lot, and so will you if you buy it.","This book is great. The organization makes sense, the author's writing is good, and the text is filled with useful code examples.About the only thing that I feel could have made this book perfect is if it contained a reference section, like those you often find in the O'Reilly texts (e.g., O'Reilly's Dynamic HTML: the Definitive Guide or JavaScript: the Definitive Guide). Too often I find myself dog-earing pages and having to flip back and forth between tables and charts. But that just demonstrates the use I get out of this book."
2,Shade damage,"It looks good and cute however paking is not that good, shade came broken now I'm stock with a fan without a glass shade."
3,ceiling fan by Westinghouse,"Arrived promptly and in perfect condition however the fan blades are quite small and do not create very much air flow in a room. It is beautiful and if you don't need much air flow from your fan, this is the perfect fan to buy."
3,"Good price, average performance.","I purchased two of these fans for installation in two rooms of an addition. They went together with no problems but the process is a little awkward. The instructions are not good, but I muddled through. Putting the motor assembly upside down in the foam shipping material held it steady while adding the fan arms and blades.The single bulb lighting is a little dim for my tastes, it does not light up the 12 by 10 rooms to comfortable levels. If you planned on an expensive dimmer switch for the light, forget it.The fan is well balanced but noisy at high speeds. Low and medium speeds are OK. I added a variable speed switch and it slowed all speeds down somewhat and, so, quieted the high speed."
5,Great Ceiling Fan!,"Put this fan in my baby's nursery. It's a very tiny room so this fan is a perfect fit! Very quiet, sturdy, and it just looks sleek. For some reason, however, I thought the metal portions of the fan were pewter, but it looks like brass."
5,This stuff works!,This is the only stuff that seems to work to eradicate red slime without unduly stressing other life.Vendor shipped on time and as described
1,Medicine Show Stuff,"Don't work - simple as that. I called the manufacturer and the rep was extremely helpful. She comped (free sample) of their phosphate/nitrate resin. However, Chemiclean did not perform as advertised. For you folks who are asking ""what is a medicine show?"" 100 years or so a go, a guy would sell a bottle of stuff that would cure every ailment from A - Z. He usually put on a small show in front of his truck or horse drawn wagon."
4,Chemi-Clean,"Work's as advertised gone in 3 days! No problem with tank life, if you have a skimmer you will need to run activated carbon and turn the skimmer down for a day or two."
4,Very nice book on variational calculus,"This book is a more thorough treatment of the calculus of variations than some of the other books on the subject that you could buy. It's bit more expensive... I especially reccomend this book if you like Sagan's other book ""Boundary and Eigenvalue Problems in Mathematical Physics"". If you like his style of writing, and I do, he again shows nice touch of explaining the material in writing and then with examples. A good book with a nicely written and more thorough treatment of the subject (unless you want a full price text that is).."
3,Good but could be better,"I really like (""plain"") books that are written in the definition, lemma, proposition, theorem, and examples style. Sagan does enunciate propositions, theorems, etc. but he does that after giving proofs for the things he will state latter. I simple don't like this style. Another point that I really dislike in Sagan book is the notation. He doen't change the notation, for instance, when he talks about a function y and the y coordinate. This is a little bit boring. Moreover, the exercises aren't stated clearly (I always have to look at the text, many pages before the exercise, to know what the exercise demands to be done). Besides this the book is very complete. A good but that could be better."
3,"Great Sound, Broke in 8 Months","These are good, comfortable headphones with a terrific sound, but the ear bud part broke after 8 months and they are a non-replaceable part. Still, they were good while they lasted and I bought another."
5,Easy Installation!,Couldn't be an easier item to install. Old one had finally broken off on the lever and would not open from the inside as the lever had fallen off from Inner handle. Within mere minutes was installed and couldn't have been simpler.
5,A most useful book in thin film area,"This is the most complete and useful bookin thin film area. It contains all cheaning and finishing methods, electroless and electroplating, dip, barrier and chemical conversion coating, thermal spray coating, CVD and PVD, etc. This book is very useful to an engineer or scientist in the field."
3,No problems so far with the product itself. Shipping on the other hand...,"The product is fairly sturdy and hasn't given us problems yet. The only downside would be that the legs seem a little flimsy. Some assembly required. And beware...the instructions are poorly printed with no written explanations. The upside is that it does not take a rocket scientist to put a fire bowl together in the first place. The company sent a couple of tools with the parts, but I would suggest using your own tools instead. Also, I thought it was strange that our screws were not placed nicely in the bag that came with it, but thrown into the box haphazardly. Once you get everything put together the bowl works just fine."
2,Read a guidebook instead,"Bought this as a way to help my family get ready for a visit to Angkor Wat. My kids became convinced that temples were going to be boring. It contains some interesting facts but they come across slowly during the video; reading a guidebook out loud would be a better use of time. No subtitles available. Leonard Nimoy is the narrator, if that makes a difference to you."
3,very pretty but. . .,"The bowls are very pretty and go well with the rest of the dishes in this series. My bowls are less than a year old, and have already begun chipping - large chips from the bottom, leaving black spots. The chips don't affect the purpose of the bowls, but definitely affect the look. Also, although I know these should not be placed in the dishwasher, I find myself wishing they could be."
2,Not what I thought.,"I thought these were Corelle, but they are not. The containers are cute, but they are not very practical. Also, they cannot go in the microwave, and it is not recommended to wash them in the dishwasher. Bummer!!! I would keep on searching. There are better buys out there."
4,Great bowls,"I really do like the sizes of the bowls and the lids are a great fit.Too bad you cannot microwave the bowls, but then you would lose the usage.I use the bowls all the time and will consider getting more. Just wish I had more sizes."
1,Unthinkably bottomless orchestra,"These would be serviceable performances were it not for the fact that there is absolutely no bottom to this ensemble! I'm sitting here with the scores of these two symphonies in hand, and the double basses are simply not there! Neither are the celli, the violas, the bassoons or clarinets. The only instruments with any presence at all are the 1st (not the 2nd) violins, the horns and the trumpets. The rest are lost in a blurry mush that is so unfocused as to make these performances, whatever other merits they might have had, essentially worthless. Trust me, you have absolutely no idea of what you're NOT hearing here. If you only knew, you'd want your money back. Avoid these like the plague!"
3,class room resource,"This book was purchased as a classroom requirement for my daughter's community college course. As a teacher, I don't generally buy resource or idea books, but this is a good one for the beginner or someone who does not have the time to search for ideas. Although it is costly, its a better investment than numerous small books. I feel that the way that the author chose to organize it could have been better; so be sure to read through the entire book as ideas for what you're looking for may be hidden under other topic headings!"
4,creative,the product has good material to teach children. priced well.shipped quickly.I recommend this book to all inspiring teachers
3,creative Resources fro the Early Childhood Classroom,I was not happy of the condition that the book was in when i recieved it. The pages was bent up and I could not fix them. Something had wasted on the book. I hope the book will be used for my personal use because that is all it can be used for.
5,Liked the book,"I used this book for my early childhood classroom. Like a lot of people have said, it is set up differently and may not be what you think it would be, but I did find it helpful when it came to thinking up themes and incorporating them into the classroom."
4,love it,I absolutly love it. I bought it to help me out for school which it worked great and I also work at a preschool so it helps me out with ideas for the class.
5,Great book - even for parents!,I am a stay at home mom and have used this book to help keep my toddler busy. It is great. Every theme has activities for all areas of learning and has great book/DVD/website resources. If it's this great for a parent - it would be wonderful for a teacher!!
2,Not what I thought,"This book has a lot of fun ideas. However, it does not provide a lot of useful Early Childhood school-based curriculum themes. It has many themes that are not very useful in a school setting, such as:'Containers', 'Dogs', 'Scissors', etc. Possibly a good book for Childcare Centers or home Childcare Providers, not too good for a public school Early Childhood classroom."
2,Magazine articles,"This book should have represented itself as a reprint of articles from Strings Magazine. Nothing wrong with that, but the book lacks cohesion as a result. One of the most valuable sections is on string selection, but as I started to read it I realized I had already read the article and for free on a web site! The section ""Sound post Adjustment"" has no technical, i.e. luthier, information about the process of adjusting the sound post. Let me sum it up: the sound post is important and if you don't like the sound consider having a luthier adjust it. If the reader is a novice violin player/owner this is a concise book on a variety of aspects, but would-be luthiers beware!"
1,Misleading Title.,"This is NOT an owners manual. It is a book of violin articels. From the stand point of a hands on musican this book is useless. It seems to contain information geared toword the neophyte but it goes off onto tangents and angles representive of a Salvidor Dahli in book form. (Why bother puting information on the purchase of a mid-level instrument while omitting points to look for in a student instrument?)It has 0 (ZERO!!!) information on setups introduces nothing of use to students and nothing a more experienced musician wouldn't allready know just from hitting web sites.So to be concrete... This ""owners manual"" will not provide any DIY tips. Will not provide any information on DIY repairs or quick fixes. It's generally useless unless you happen to be really curious about the violin as an instrument. (In which case it would make a great coaster to put your coffey on while you read a more intelligently assembled book.)"
2,Partly an Owner's Manual,"I am fairly new to the violin, and I have a lot of questions about caring for my violin. This bookViolin Owner's Manual Book (String Letter Publishing) (Strings) (Strings Guide)was a great idea, but it didn't answer many questions.The book contains short chapters written by very knowledgeable people: violinists, violin makers, bow makers, and dealers. Each person wrote about a specialty of theirs. It's not so bad that the articles sometimes overlap, but there are significant gaps between the articles.About a third of the articles were actually applicable to the selection of a violin for purchase, not to care of the violin after you buy it. If you now own an inexpensive, student violin, you might find this book of value before you buy your next violin."
2,Misleading Title!,"This book should be called ""A guide for MEN who are partners of incest survivors"". I was hopeful when I read online in the first few pages about males being victims. There's not one account of that in the book though. Every single personal story (about 35 or so) is written by a man who is the partner of a female survivor. What about male survivors and the women who love them? Although there is some good information in this book, men and women process things in very very different ways, and this book does not address any of that, unfortunately."
2,A book that suggets MORE abuse!,"The middle of ""Ghosts in the Bedroom"" had me in tears. He actually suggests MORE abusein the sense that you question allowing affairs, non-sexual and sexual, as alternatives for the partner while thesurviver heals. THAT WOULD NOT HELP THE SURVIVOR TO TRUST AND HEAL!!! That is simply more abuse added to the survivor.If you are a survivor, you are worth loving, cherishing and being someone's ONE AND ONLY and you have the right totell your partner they cannot use porn or another person for their sexual needs. Allowing porn or an affair would be MORE DAMAGING for you and your spouse. ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS BOOK TO ANYONE!!! There are others out there...and suggesting unfaithfulness is NOT healing or trust building!!!"
2,Primer: possibly useful for male partner of female survivor,"As a primer pointing out the issues a female survivor of incest must confront and experience, this book can serve as male partner's reference. It also mentions potential issues the partner can confront as well. However, I cannot recommend it as an in depth treatment of partner issues. Having purchased this book on the recommendation of a partner reading list and the reviews here at amazon, I was sorely disappointed. As a female partner, I did not find any useful strategies or discussions to aid the partner in coping with partner issues such as excessive caretaking, boundary setting or balancing of the partner and survivor's interests. The Laura Davis book, Allies in Healing was more helpful in this area."
2,Dependency R Us,"There's good material in this book, but the overriding theme gets old- that if you are involved with an abuse survivor, you must be screwed up yourself with some sort of dependency ""disorder."" Co-dependent, Primary dependencies, secondary dependencies- they are all here. A far better book is ""Allies in Healing."" It provides constructive information for helping your partner, and yourself."
4,Good Record,this Album has Solid Instrumentation but it's not Among His Must Have's.but still their is Quality Material here.Tasty Pudding is the Cut.Miles is one of the few Artists Ever that can have 2 or 3 Great Songs on a Album and it still is Important.Why?Because He Puts so Much into that Performance.He was SOmething Else.
2,Bad cancels good,"2 1/2This early compilation spans heated passages to cold intonations, landing a little adrift of what the standard quality of standards bore back then but supplying enough fodder for completists to be grateful."
4,CAP Barbell Olympic Plate Rack,"Another addition for our home gym. It is well built, easy to put together, great for the price. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I wish the handles were longer. We are able to sit 245lbs (2x45, 2x35, 2x25, 2x10, 2x5, 2x2.5) on it. We still have some 45 and 35 plates sitting and will need another rack for it."
4,Slight manufacturing issue but worked out great,"I read over many reviews for various plate racks before deciding on this one, based on form factor and the amount of weights it can hold. I was fairly peeved when I first started assembling it, though, because one of the cross pieces would not fit because there was a huge hunk of welding left behind. This 1/4"" excess meant I could not put the rack together but thankfully, I have a Dremel and was able to grind down the excess welding in about 5 minutes. The only other aggravating part was tightening the bolts for the top 2 weight holders; it is a very tight squeeze and difficult but not impossible to do. Once these issues were resolved, the rack met my expectations and the form factor is perfect for the area I needed to put it. It is sturdy and will probably last the rest of my life."
4,I like it.,"Assembly was easy. There was staining on the bottom of the stand, which at first I thought was rust but wiped clean almost completely even though unit was packaged in a bag."
3,Does the job; top two weight supports hard to tighten,"It's a beefy hunk of metal, basically; which is all it needs to be. Would have rated 4 stars, but the top two weight supports near the apex of the rack are hard to tighten with the supplied allen wrench. The opposite screw head interferes with the placement of the wrench in the screw head you're tightening. It can be done, but only barely and carefully."
3,Ok. Doesn't fit larger plates that well.,Ok. Doesn't fit larger plates that well but good for smaller weights. Very easy to assemble. Worth the price but you get what you pay for.
4,Nice product,The plate rack arrived quickly and as with all workout equipment in a lot of pieces. Unfortunately not all of the hardware was with it. Not a deal breaker but I never understand companies who cant throw a couple of extra bolts washers or nuts in the bag. At the manufacturing level in China this can't be more than fractions of a cent! Still an functional rack.
1,So close....,"This will not hold bumper plates. The spacing is off by about 1.5 inches to accommodate standard sized bumper plates. If you only have iron plates it will work. Also, the posts are only 3-4"" long. Very difficult to stack more than 2-3 plates per post. Would have given 5 stars for 4-5"" posts spaced for bumper plates. Will be returning."
4,Pretty Much What I Expected,"Assembly took 5 minutes, all parts were there. Despite the pictures here, the color isn't white, it's like hospital grey/blue. Not a huge deal, but it does look out of place in my home gym at least. The pegs are short so it's two plates per pegs MAX. I have it on carpet and I'm pretty comfortable with pets and kids around it but I think if I had to do it over again, I'd buy something in a different color with a wider base.Having said that, I think it's a good value for the price."
1,bent bottom base portion of the stand,I'm unsure if I can keep this product. It has a bent portion of the base that attaches to another part. It does not seem like a solid stand.
2,No Hardware,Unfortunately didn't open item to assemble until return limit had expired. When I opened to assemble there were not any bolts/hardware in the package to assemble the pieces.
1,Don't buy this version,This version only has half of Divorce His Divorce Hers - It goes directly to the 2nd half of the movie (Divorce Hers) and bypasses the menue where you get to choose either half. Amazon will not offer to replace it but will want you to go through the trouble of sending back for a refund.
1,LIZ DOWN ON HER LUCK,"THE DRIVER'S SEAT has Liz almost forced to perform a certain sex act...! It also has five minutes of andy warhol---with a dubbed voice!DIVORCE HIS/HERS is just the usual made-for-tv 1970s movie of the week...Liz and Dick were also on the lucille ball show around the same time, after they peaked in the 1960s."
4,A good session but does not stand out,"Very good album from Phil. Nevertheless I found it a little bit predictable even if, of course, Phil plays great. Sugan from Phil for example or the album with Jimmy Rainey are much more interesting efforts from Phil. I love more than this one even the tribute concert ""Bird's night"" on the Savoy label. ""Four altos"" is another better and more interesting effort than ""Woodlore"". Or even the albums he recorded with Quill offer more variety and interesting points. This was the first leader session from Phil and he delivered don't get me wrong but this album it's not something you can't stay without especially if you have more albums from Woods. I'd prefer Sugan over this one for sure (by the way Sugan has Red Garland on piano, a big boost!). Not that this album is bad, on the contrary, it is a very good collection of bop lines and ballads. But just one of many great sessions of the period. It does not stand out for me. 4 stars, next session please. ;)))"
4,SOOOOOOOOOOO Pretty!!!,This is by far one of the prettiest tea kettle I've seen. Not only that but it is perfectly functional as well!!!I'm very happy with it!
3,Leaks,I love the design but it leaks no matter what water level is inside. I always have to wipe up spills.
2,sharp edges,I can only give it two stars because the metal at the inside base of the handle is unfinished and quite sharp. I almost cut myself before I realized the edges were not covered or filed as to not be hazardous. The kettle itself is very pretty.
3,looks aren't everything...,"very pretty to look at but has a very strange/creepy low two-tone ""whistle"" only holds about half the container without boiling over, and leaks or spills with every pour."
4,beautiful product,"The only complaint would be the funny sounding whistle it emits when coming to a boil. It sounds like some kind of air-raid horn and the first time it quite startled me. I prefer the old fashioned whistle. Otherwise, it is a wonderful size to make up a batch of herb tea. I use only one tea bag, sweetener and Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice."
2,Strange sounding teakettle,I gave it two stars because I cannot pour water from it that it does not dribble down the spout. Also it does have a strange sound.
1,Leaky spout,Spout leaks when pouring water from teapot leaving a rather large mess to clean up. Kettle does not always whistle when water has boiled.
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,I first bought the Motorola print server so all of our computers could print easily and wirelessly. when i got it it was so easy to set up. Now i have the wireless router the motorola 850GP. I had before a very bad D-Link DI-624 C Version they are horrable. Once i got the motorola all i had to do was plug it in to my cable modem and the power. Then i used a very simple installation CD that it came with and that took at the most 10 minutes. Then it took me to a website that was also easy that helped me to set up the security settings and the IP addresses on my 3 computers. In no time i had all the computers on the internet wirelessly and printing wirelessly. If you are having trouble installing it DONT hessitate to call Customer Service they can get it up and running in way less time then it would take to be mad at the modem.
4,A little hard to turn,"I bought this for my mother who was very pleased with it, except for the fact that it is a bit heavy for her to turn alone. It cannot be filled more than halfway and then needs to work so another compost option is needed."
5,It's plastic!,"I used this for a fender eliminator on my motorcycle, it worked perfectly. I'd buy this again for the same purpose since the price was great and shipping was fast."
3,I wouldn't buy the product again.,"This is a nasty tasting liquid with a really nice applicator system, however it didn't really deter my dog. She made a face but kept licking. The word ""doggedly"" comes to mind."
2,"This does not prevent my dog from chewing up the rug, his bed... anything.","Perhaps it's the dabber top which doesn't allow a lot of product to be dispensed? But I have dabbed, and dragged this all over the edges of fabric items I'd prefer our little dog not chew, and he's shredded the corners of his bed anyways, even with plenty of available toys to chew on instead. Hopefully I can find another product that works, or see if spraying this one might actually do the job..."
1,Didn't work,This is not a very strong deterrent. I wasn't impressed maybe it would work better on a smaller dog. My dog had a yeast infection on his feet so maybe under normal conditions it might work better.
2,Tried for thumbsucking - no go,"This might work well for dogs, but it doesn't work at all for human boys! I read somewhere that it was safe to try for thumbsucking. It wore off almost immediately. My son would walk up to me 10 minutes after I'd applied it and tell me to reapply! The swiss one (Malava? Mavala?) works 100 times better."
4,"Easy to Use, SW that actually _exceeds_ its ad copy!","I purchased this SW after trying the demo of Magix's UK Dance Edition SW. MusicMaker 7 is very easy to use, the menu items in the program are arranged in a very logical, yet intuitive fashion.Help files included with the program are very well written and, unlike all too many programs today, actually answer real, practical questions that arise when one is learning to use the SW.This program is packed with functionality,an easy to use interface and makes the creative process the focus rather than having to struggle with arcane command/menu sets.The included video and audio samples are of very good quality; if one is a beginner, like me, you can wax creative for some time to come without having to buy any more samples CDs.Try it, you will like it!"
3,Great Price!,We got the helmet because of the price. It fits a little differently (tighter on the cheeks) than those of the same brand and size we tried in the store and may have something to do with the type of padding used inside. We think it will work with some modification of padding. It will work though for the price.
4,Watch shrinkage,"I know it said ""cold water"" but this would mean I would have to wash these p.j.s separately for the rest of my life. I put the wash on ""warm"". The pants came out OK(shrunk to nice length) but the top was a bit smaller.Before washing I tried these on so I could tell the shrinkage. I ordered a LARGE because I knew there would be shrinkage in washing. Shrunk-- not too bad but more than the ones I get from Land's End. They are wearable after wash, nice quality, well made. Front pocket is really small. I wear a 12-14 but I think I'd order an X-Large in this particular brand if ordering again."
4,Swar Utsav by Ganesh & Kumaresh,"Brilliant performance by Ganesh & Kumaresh. The Hamsadwani piece Adbhutha is excellent. Ganesh & Kumaresh have violin to a different platform in Indian classical music. You rarely see the technical perfection and style of violin in Indian classical music when compared to western classical music. But, Ganesh & Kumaresh are a rare exception."
4,A decent book,"Some interesting facts on this storied city. Each chapter is pretty good, but not rivetting reading."
4,Great Labor Songs,"Not only is the music on this good but, the message is fantastic. Anyone interested in the working class will love this CD."
2,Groove On,"This book is 188 pages and appears to be a relativley easy and quick read. I've owned it for some months now and haven't read it from cover to cover and I'm the type of reader who can tackle a 300-page page-turner in all of two days. Something about the way this book is written really looses me and the plot isn't easy to understand. On the other hand, the sex scenes practically jump off the page. I wouldn't recommend this one to the serious reader, but more to a person looking to get their groove on."
5,Something refreshing,"This album was like a burst of fresh air. I figured I could spare the extra few bucks, so I took a chance, not expecting to really be impressed by what I heard. When I turned on the record, though, I heard one of the best collections of rock and roll music I've heard in a long, long time. It's fun, it's energetic, it's downright exciting- in short it's pure rock and roll.Fell So Hard is a melodic, kick-butt start to an EP that features four of the best foot-moving rock songs I've heard since the Strokes and OK GO came on the scene not too long ago. They are great not only because of the catchy, original feel to each song, but they don't pretend to be something they aren't- there are no pain-filled power chords about highschool heartbreak, they just want to make you dance and feel good about rock and roll again."
5,/thank Goodness for something new and different,"I saw The Sun live recently and thought to myself, ""Wow they were really great, I think I will buy their EP."" I didnt allow my expectations to get too high but wow was i surprised! i have not taken the cd out of my player since i got it, which was about 2 1/2 weeks ago. Each track on the disc is unique in its own way, yet the album carries this strange eerie theme throughout. Considering it is such a short album, 6 songs, The Sun showcase their creative diversity differently in each one of those songs, thereby creating the feeling that this album is just the beginning of what will hopefully be pure, dirty rock-n-roll. Can't wait for what comes next!"
4,"it's not great, it's not bad, it's just short and medeokur.","i bought this ep because i thought it would have as much musical body to it as thier live preformances do. well, ""love and death"" is ok but i exsepted more. i still advise you (the reader of this review) to buy it for the hell of it. i like the dark touch of it and vocal syles of chris burney. it sounds better the more you listen to it (by the third time for me), it's catchy. they are much better live and in front of you, so i advice you to see them live. they often open for the h.. h.. heat and thats when i saw them. this ep contain a 13 minute cd-rom video too; intitled ""the worst movie ever."" i only hope they release a full album soon, which is stronger. i saw the video for ""carry it all"" on a late night mtv2 show. so they are starting to break through to underground-national appeal. although this ep is good, not great i could see them get publisity like ""the sounds"" and "" h.. h.. heat"" are getting now."
4,This game rocks!!!!!!!,"I love this game! It helped me learn about Homer's epic poem ""The Odyssey"", even though some of the things that should have appeared didn't, but hey, my dad got the game used so maybe it was a little junky. :-)"
4,Cute!,"What a fun way to learn about the Odyssey! I really liked playing the game, although I think it's a little hard for younger kids, especially the last puzzle. I'm 15 and it took me at least six hours to play. And that's not counting the times I had to start over before I figured out how to save games. That was a little hard too. I had to go on the internet message board several times to be able to finish it. It seemed a little slow, but that might have been our computer, also. In general, this seems like a good game for young teens and pre-teens, but not any younger, unless a parent or older sibling helps."
5,Childrens clothes,"I bought this for my friends 2 year old grandson. His mother loves it as she can pour him into it and he can potter about and get really mucky, as young children do. Good value and quality"
3,Trance K-Tel style,"This CD reminds me of disco-era K-Tel vinyl records. There are a bunch of slamming tracks here, but they're all cut down to the length of a 45 RPM single. The ""louder is better"" mastering is god-awful: it's the polar opposite of the tinny sound of, you guessed it, old K-Tel records. I can't quite hate it though; I was raised on AM-radio disco, and this CD evokes a perverse nostalgia. It's trash, and I like it because it's trash. Of course I got it for dirt cheap, so I don't feel ripped off or anything.Now, if you want the definitive introduction to contemporary trance, nothing beats Paul Oakenfold's Tranceport Vol. 1. But if you're deep enough into the genre to get a strange kick out of hearing it get the K-Tel treatment, then you just might enjoy this."
3,Dead tell no tales,I thought this would have been better if there wasn't any swear words in it. The main character in this book has a friend named Rattray who writes him a letter and the man could remember it for forty years. The man also has a wife who dies and looks almost like lady the man met while at sea. The man says a statement that stuck out to me he said it is better to be a good husband than a good ship mate I think that is what he said.The man lives a long lonely life and Rattray wrote that letter before he died.
3,It was alright,"I enjoyed the book very much even though there were areas I thought a bit too slow. However, I do consider myself a synical reader...to the point."
4,Rotors for 1992 Jeep cherokee 4x4,"I purchased this to replace my stock rotors. My stock ones were 20 years old, so I figured new ones wouldn't hurt. I immediately noticed better stopping power. XJ's are known to be poor brakers, so having these new rotors helped a little. I did noticed that it seems to rust a little bit more quickly than the stock ones, either that or the rust is more noticeable because of the fact that the rest of it is new shiny metal."
4,"Lovely variations on the ""Birth of the Cool"" style....","These eight selections, originally released as two 10-inch records in the early 1950s, all feature the lovely trumpet of Art Farmer but are really showcases for two contrasting arrangers, both of whom are clearly inspired by the Miles Davis ""Birth of Cool"" sessions, which featured similar line-ups of a lead trumpet voice against ensembles of darker horns like trombone and baritone sax. Quincy Jones fully adopts the timbres and tonalities of ""Birth of Cool"" but already displays his funkier, more ""pop"" soul sensibilities in his arrangements, even in these early sets. Gigi Gryce, on the other hand, takes the instrumental line-up and returns it to a brighter, harder-edged sound, more clearly in the ""East Coast"" hard-bop school. The Jones tunes end up being the clear winners in this side-by-side comparison, but all eight tracks are charming."
4,Get To The Farm Before It's Gone,"""The Art Farmer Septet"" features selctions from three different sessions. The first four tracks are from July 2, 1953 wih the septet of Farmer on trumpet, Jimmy Cleveland on trombone, Cliff Solomon on tenor sax, Oscar Estell on baritone sax, Quincy Jones on piano, Monk Montgomery on electric bass and Sonny Johnson on drums. Tracks 5-8 are from June 7, 1954 and again it's a septet with Farmer and Cleveland, this time joined by Charlie Rouse on tenor sax, Danny Bank on baritone sax, Horace Silver on piano, Percy Heath on bass and Art Taylor on drums. The last track, ""When Your Lover Has Gone,"" is actually performed by a quartet and also appears onTwo Trumpets, leaving me to wonder why they bothered to include it here. Overall, solid dates with much better things still to come from the Farmer."
2,Misleading,"Flimsy evidence, not to mention half of the cases mentioned in this book are already solved. Waste of time, sorry."
1,Ears watch out!,"Amplifies EVERYTHING!!! Means even the cable as it swishes against your clothing or when cable touches your face.Audio not clear, sounds like listening through jar."
3,Good for TV watching.,Non-directional microphone tends to amplify closest and loudest sounds. This is a decent amplifier for watching TV in a somewhat quiet room. Voices are lost to background noises in restaurant's and businesses. In the living room EARZ do help hear conversation.
1,DON'T BOTHER!!,"THE ONLY WAY THIS THING WORKS IS IF IT IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SOUND. IF MY FATHER HAS TO SIT A FOOT AWAY FROM THE TV FOR IT TO WORK, WHAT'S THE USE OF IT. PLEASE DON'T WASTE THE MONEY LIKE I DID!!"
1,A total wast of money!,"The Sonic Earz does not perform as stated. All you hear is static, you cannot hear people ""up to 60 feet away"". In fact, you can'thear them a foot away. Forget the movies, TV or any place/situation you may be in. In fact, you call talk into it and you still won't hear anything. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Sonic Earz Personal Sound Amplifier,I bought this unit for litening to TV. Even sitting right in front of tv all I can hear is back ground noise. It didn't work at all for me.
2,SandyP,"item cheaply made, did not do what it was supposed to, I couldn't hear across a 10 foot room, any better than without it. It had scratchy interference to boot! Def, not worth your time or money"
1,Not what I wanted,"This was a disappointment, I bought it as I can't hear the tv and it said it would work for that but it only amplifies sounds all around and not the tv. As always Amazon was easy to work with for a full refund. If you want to have something for hearing sounds other than a tv it works just fine,"
1,Very disappointed!,"I am very disappointed in this product. When I turned it on and put the plugs in my ears, all I heard was static and noise. Nothing was clear and I had to turn it up quite a bit to hear. Also, the little radio is worthless. Unable to locate any station to listen to. I wish I had never purchased this item."
1,Bad Buy,Hoped that this item would benefit my husband's hearing but it was a terrible purchase. Lots of static and irratic sound.
3,sound amplifier,"I guess it does what I paid for (glad it wasn't too much). If you touch the little unit (with your hand or your clothing or a piece of paper or yarn) there is way too much noise and we haven't figured out how to keep it ""quiet""! My mother is using it when she is at church and when trying to watch TV and is using her cellphone case to hold it so nothing touches it. She has enjoyed being able to have the TV sound down lower and it has been nice for her to hear at church again."
4,Hear Hear!,"Ordered this and it came right away. Now my elderly mother doesn't have to blast the TV to hear it and everybody is much happier! Don't forget to get those little tiny batteries...it uses them, not the popular sized ones."
1,Sonic Earz Amplifier,Amplifier seemed to work when it arrived but broke within one day when it came near a vibrating object. Definitely a good idea but built perhaps a little to light for routine use.
1,Not worth the postage,"The Sonic Earz Sound Amplifier is NOT the product it claims to be. It does amplify sound, but it is the sound of it rubbing your pocket, or you touching it...not voices or the TV. I am very disappointed."
2,Absolutely usless.,"Terrible. Sound was loud, clarity not acceptable. Sorry I boutht it. I returned it but haven't got any credit or reply."
4,A good Value,This product performs as intended. Battery life is certainly acceptable too. If you think your hearing is going down hill and want an inexpensive way to judge how far...buy this and see it your quality of life improves? You just might giveup vanity and buy a real hearing aid. A good value at $15.00.
2,"May work, may not","The big reason to purchase Drive Image is supposedly the Windows interface which is user friendly and easy to use.... if it works. On machines with SCSI as well as IDE drives, the Windows interface may not work (like on my machine) and you're back to booting disks to run the program (like Ghost). And it's not easy to find this information. It took me hours to come across this on the Powerquest website. Also, for support they want a copy of a file which cannot be created in Windows XP because it wants direct disk access and Windows won't permit it. I would imagine there is some way to run it, but hey, enough is enough just to get a question answered like ""why won't this program work?""."
1,False Security,"I've bought two versions of drive image and recommended it to many friends. The concept is sound, create an image of your system in case disaster strikes.The reality is not so good. I've tried to restore a drive image only to find the image was no good and any restore was impossible!! . One friend had a similar problem and a similar result - no restore!!.These are not fancy systems but from major manufacturers!Drive Image does NOT verify it has created a good image, by deflault, I believe.When you view the manufacturer's web site you probably won't see any upgrades to the software. Upgrades and corrections, don't seem to merit any attention.This, in my experience, is ""myth-ware"". Meaning it could serve a very good purpose but with my limited experience, I have to question whether it servers any purpose at all?"
2,Not for average computer user.,"10Dec2002 ..... After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this program. One thing that became painfully obvious upon use was, this is not for the average user. Instructions are vague, documentation is lacking detail, and customer support via eMail is not any better, (that is, if you even get a reply). My experience with Power Quest and also owning Partition Magic 8.0 , is that this company does not stand behind it's products. Simple support question that should have been covered in manual or web site help files? Get real ... Because I don*t work for Power Quest, I have no financial gain in glossing over the many errors this program contains. I'm just an end user that want's a program that works out of the box, and I*m not willing to devote the hours necessary to make deep system changes in order to compensate a programs short comings. One thing I can say positive, is that it comes in a nice box. (system: AMD 1800+, WinXP, mass RAM & HD) Bob"
1,Drive Image 2002 fails with SCSI CD-RW.,"Drive Image 2002 fails writing to SCSI CD-RW. Destroyed many CD-R disks trying to get it to work. Error code 1805. No help from their support people. Their customer service was nice to deal with, after a long telephone wait. I got an RMA and returned the unuseable software. Too bad since I love their Partition Magic product."
5,The Ultimate Personal Drive Imaging and Back up Utility!!!,"I tried Norton Ghost 2002 and it's a nightmare. I have a Windows 2000 environment. I wanted to be able to save a image file to a network drive. Fisrt, it took me hours to make the Ghost boot disk with IBM token ring pc card driver. Then, it turned out that Ghost can't just save a image file. It can only clone a drive, which means it would use my whole 60GB disk just to back up my 6GB disk! Finally, the long-waited Drive Image 2002 is out. I just used its wizard to create a virtual boot disk with NIC driver (friendly and easy process compare to Ghost's DOS clumsy interfacy) and then went through another wizard to make back up image. In a couple hours, I've backed up my desktop and laptop hard disks to my server. No sweat! Plus, I used the drive copy option to upgrade my desktop hard drive from 6GB to 40GB in an hour! Ghost is really just a ghost now."
2,Won't write to NTFS file systems...,"I had to return this software because it would not write to an NTFS file system. Actually, the program did write the image file to the NTFS file system (I'm running WindowsXP Professional) but when I went to verify the contents of the image file with the image explorer utility I got an error message. Don't buy this program if you need to write to an NTFS file system. Use Norton Ghost 2002 instead."
1,Drive Image 2002,"I have been running PC's for many ,many years and I cannot get this useless piece of Software to run. SAVE your $$$$$$$Do not purchase. There are literally hundreds of error messageslisted and I cannot even correct the one I have ( error 1805). Support solutions are worthless."
1,Horribly complicated,"I'm not an IT wizard or MS certified, but I'm also not a neophyte. Drive Image 2002 might be good for disk imaging onto removable media or a local hard disk, but it really sucks for writing this same image to a network drive for safekeeping. It has to reboot the machine to DOS, and you must create ""network boot disks"" on floppys. This process is horribly complicated and involves multiple reboots and other steps. Their docs are useless, and the web support is nearly so. Their phone support will cost you $$. Wait for their newer version due to be released soon. I returned this software."
1,Forgot to burn a disc?,"I wasted an evening and about 37 CD-R's trying to back up my main harddrive. Nothing fancy - just a normal backup of a HD with 2 partitions on my home system. I decompressed the VFD folder to get it to start - then went through the process of burning all those discs. Then it asks me to re-insert a the first disc, then the last disc, then disc 3 with image .003. Well, it isn't there. Disc 3 has image .004 on it. WTF??I'm not a software engineer, but I'm not stupid - the program should not allow me to over-write a previous disc, so either it allowed me to do just that - or it didn't create image .003. Either way - the only option I had was to cancel out of the backup process and start over. . . with Norton Ghost! Bleah."
1,"Mad, Mad, Mad","I tried to do a disk copy from a larger to smaller drive. It said it had to re-partition the source drive first, so I let it, thinking that if there is a problem, there must be a way to reset the change. How wrong I was. The process terminated, apparently because the destination drive was not formatted. Anyway, when I tried to re-boot to windows from the original dirve, it gave me a ""paging"" error and could not boot into windows. Searching the knowledge-base, I used wregfix.exe to try to fix. Now the drive isn't recognizable even from a Win98 floppy boot disk. I wish I can ""talk"" to support, but I'm not willing to spend $30 per incident (mad as hell) for a problem caused by the product and the maker isn't willing to stand by it. I returning it. BTW, I'm a highly skilled software engineer usually pretty good at solving problems."
5,My primary backup solution for years,"I'm not quite sure why people are whining about DI 2002. To be blunt, it works wonderfully - as well as 5.0. Indeed it even has more options, such as DOS-level networkable boot floppies. I almost always run it from DOS mode, from a bootable CD. My previous review is still accurate and attached. This stuff works like a champ, and imho disk imaging backups are the best way to go.Previous review:I've been using DriveImage as my primary backup solution for literally years. This latest version is the best so far. I have had no difficulties whatsoever under WindowsXP. I especially like the ImageExplorer!I make backups on a very regular basis, under multiple machines. I've never had a corrupted backup, or been disappointed with the results."
1,Drive Image 2002,"WARNING:The product documentaion is just a few pages long and does not convey the full extent of steps necessary to actually perform a complete hard drive image back up and restore.This product actually rendered the drive I was trying to back up inactive and would not boot frtom the new drive.If you value your data watch out using this one!I spent 70 dollars on this software."" I will share my strong consumer opinions with all"""
4,Great trio work with a unique talent at the keys,"Great trio work with a unique talent at the keys, but this is tempered by the fact that, while Monk had all those great pioneering original compositions written, when he signed with Riverside in 1955, producer Orrin Keepnews persuaded him to first record standards so he would appear more accessible to the average jazz fan. It's fascinating to here him interpret these well-known tunes in his inimitable way, and this may serve as a low-risk way for a newbie to check out Monk, but it's down the list of critical Monk CD's to begin building a collection with. ""Brilliant Corners"" or ""Monk's Music"" are better places to start for those bold enough to sample pure genius. Also, Pettiford and Blakey are excellent but fairly restrained here, as the purpose of this recording was to showcase Monk's playing. Still, if you love Monk and jazz standards, this is pure ear candy."
5,romantic and modern,"This is a very interesting recording of not so well known but worthy music. Braetan has wonderful operas and in this recording you can appreciate his musicianship and his deep contact with the folk music of his country. In his own way he is a composer of the likes of Kodaly and Bartok and deserves more attention in Music History. The baritone has a beautiful voice and the pianist is very sensible to his expresivity. Ideal to listen on the car, the best antidote to rush hour."
5,A Question of Innocence,Brandilyn can do real-life drama as well as she does fiction! At least in this book Brandilyn takes the time to make sure the reader understands the process.
1,"""Don't Buy This Item!!!""",I purchased this unit for emergency use. Had it in the trunk of my car for about three months. My daughter called to tell me she had a flat tire. I drove to where her car was located. Plugged the unit into her cigarette lighter outlet. It ran for about twenty seconds and stopped. It blew the fuse on her lighter (10 amp. I then tried it on my car's lighter outlet (15 amp) which it also blew.Tried to return the unit to Pep Boys but since I had opened the box and it was beyond thirty days they wouldn't allow me to return it.Clerk at Pep Boys said they'd had problems with the unit blowing fuses.
1,Blew the fuse,"I had this less than 1 year and now it will go in the garbage. It blew two 15amp fuses in our Odyssey, so I plugged it into my Vibe. It didn't blow the Vibe's fuse, and not even the fuse in the unit itself, but melted the plug, making it unusable."
1,Cheap Chinese junk,"My son bought this pump, and it stopped working. I disassembled it and found several problems. The machining of the valveseat contained metal burrs preventing it from reaching rated pressure. It kept blowing fuses so I traced the problem to the motor windings. One of the wires was sticking out of the rotor laminates and was rubbing against the motor case. Construction and assembly overall was very poor, and I predict that it might work for a few hours, if you are lucky, then quit. Trying to find a quality made pump in this price range is difficult."
1,Out of the Box Failure,"This compressor was dead right out of the box. I plugged into two different auto DC adapters, and I finally connected it directly to a 12-volt power supply in my lab. It did not work at all."
2,"Great compressor, poor life, died in less than one year","The title of this review should say it all. I am very careful with things I own and yet this first Master Flow compressor I owned died in about 8 months under normal use (small car tire, bike tires). I exchanged it at my local automotive store for a second one. It also died in just about a year. Pumps great while it lasts and it seemed very durable. But it was quite deceiving as they both just quit working. The motor started freezing and eventually it just stopped.Edit: To be fair, my second one still works. Turns out the fault was with both a blown fuse in my cigarette lighter as well as the fact it wasn't drawing enough power from the ac/dc wall converter. So it seems to have a lot of power, which may be blowing fuses."
4,Does the Job Well.,"Outstanding little product.Sure, it takes a minute to do the job, but it's not a ""shop"" compressor!It's a well made device that does the job for which it was intended."
5,Master Flow compressor,This compressor is very portable and looks well made. I've just used it once and it worked fine.
2,Broken quick connect,"Purchased Master Flow Cyclone MF1040 at Pep Boys in March 08 for $29.98 ( $35 as of July 08) because of its design, storage bag, and high output for a low price. Greatly disappointed and embarassed when I opened the empressive black bag with shiny new pump and coil hose to fill low tire in front of family and friends and the quick connnect hose connection would not fit properly onto the pump. We tried for a couple minutes and had to drive to the nearest gas station to fill the tire. I will research other brands since I don't trust Master Flow. Not sure why Amazon has it listed for $44. But it makes since to get it shipped to you unless you happen to be driving by a PepBoys. After sales tax, the $6 differance with $4.25/gallon gas will get me about 20 miles in an average truck or suv. Definately get it shipped if you own a Hummer."
1,For toys or small tires only,"Couldn't get from 30psi, up to 45 psi on a 275x75-17 Goodyear MTR mud tire w/o it overheating on 1st tire!. Ok for small car tires maybe. I bought it w/the intention of airing down tires on my Sequoia for off roading (20-30psi). Even w/tire jacked off the ground I couldn't fill it. Perhaps I'm at fault for not buying a better unit. Or this was not designed for my purpose. For bigger or high psi (above 44psi) tires you need this Smittybilt 2780 2.54 CFM Universal Air Compressor"
4,Review of Master Flow portable air compressor,The Master Flow compressor is easy to use and works well. Both my wife and I carry one each with us in our cars now. The compressor and other parts come with a nice holder to keep them in.
1,Fragile Plastic Parts,Tried twice to buy this compressor with no luck. Both times it arrived with cracked and broken plastic end pieces. The end pieces are so fragile they do not survive shipping.
1,Piece of trash,"Not only did this compressor not work at all, but the quick-release air hose did not fit onto the nozzle. Don't waste your money on this brand."
1,Pretty Piece of *#&!*!,"Although I didn't get this from Amazon I MUST leave a review here at how horribly constructed this thing is. Long story short, the connection for the piston broke in half after literally the 2nd use. Completely severed under no load (totally flat tire / like 5 psi). Thankfully my wife's car was in the driveway when it happened and not on the side of some 70mph highway. Considering this is something you use in an emergency you're gambling your (and family's) safety with this toy."
1,Unusable and Inadequate,"This compressor only worked for one tire and has ceased since. In my opinion, it is a hunk of junk."
1,DOA,Product was shipped in brown paper. The pressure gage head was broken on arrival. Poor packaging. I asked for a replacement.
3,Good except for the pencil pressure gauge,"I have used it for several times to inflate car tires, bike tires and a basket ball. It worked fine except the pencil pressure gauge disintegrated and sent parts flying the last time I used. Luckily it didn't hurt anyone."
2,Not durable,"I got this compressor just over a year ago and have used it less than ten times. It broke yesterday as I was topping off my tires. At the rate I was using it, it should have lasted years longer. I've picked up a highly rated PSX2 power supply/compressor at COSTCO. If this breaks in a year, I know COSTCO will take care of it for me."
1,christmas day disappointment,"the game did not work out of the box. to start or play the game, you have to move the hand-held football, but ours did not work unless we shook it vigorously. the few times we did get the game to start, we again were faced with the same problem when it came time to throw a pass. only after shaking the ball vigorously would it read a pass thrown. not the experience we were expecting. graphics were lame. returning the unit today."
3,At First.....,"At first my kids loved it, then it was just boring in about 2 months. Not the right thing for my husband's sister's 5 year old to play with. He broke the mat with the cord in a few minutes."
3,madden football,"my son was thrilled with the game at first, but like most toys it has ended up in a corner."
1,A stupid toy,This toy stinks!!!You have to use the mat to throw the football.you cant run the football that far.play a football team thats more fun.
2,FOOOOOZZZZZZZZBBBBBBBBBALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL,"It was very EDUCATIONAL it taught me the meaning of life. HERE IS THE MEANING OF LIFE: T. O. GOING DEEP, OHH NO WATCH OUT FOR MY GRANDMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Uninspired,"Perhaps Bill Johnson was enthused about the writing process at one time, but this book doesn't reflect that. He may have taught too many courses over the years to the point he couldn't generate enough interest in his own manuscript. The promise is nothing new. It is clearly dicussed in Nancy Kress's beginnings, middles and Ends: a very good book by a published writer, not just a teacher of writing."
2,"I love Seressia, but not this book.","Her first book, No Commitment Required was flawless, but she faltered with this one. The concept was a good one, but the execution didn't hit the mark. The heroine, Maya is cool as is Nick and Taylor but there is something that is missing in this book that just left me wishing for more. I wasn't satisfied when I finished this book and I'm sad to say this considering this is the same author of No Commitment Required."
5,Heartwarming,"Sweet wonderful characters, esp. Taylor the little girl who keeps these two together.Very realistic."
3,Not too Shabby,"Character development needed work. Storyline was good, but execution could have been a bit better. Also had some good dialogue."
4,"Enchanting, Quick page turner","I enjoyed this book very much. It was my first time reading anything by this author. The only aspect that I didn't appreciate was the mixed race of the main female character, Mya. I wanted a book about an African American woman and white man but it was 'white washed' by her not being 100% black. It played into the stereotype that white men would only want a black woman if she were biracial or multiracial or in some way, exotic. I myself am multi-racial, so this is nothing personal but I wish that the character was not 'built' this way. I am not sure why the author did that, but besides that detail, this book was very well written. There were aspects of it that were a bit far fetched- but it is a romance novel so that genre has to be respected and expected for some 'fantasy' freedom and leeway. Overall, a good read that you will have trouble putting down."
4,A very strange twist,"Two people are truly in love with each other.Maya and Nick's story is equally refreshing because it is rare to read an IR story where the heroine is not emotionally needy and the hero does not have a Type A personality.However, I was put off by Nick's lying about his deceased wife who was his very much alive ex-wife to both Maya and his daughter, Taylor. That is why I gave this book four stars instead of five."
5,Wishes Granted.,"I am an avid reader of love stories. As a woman I prefer my main character tell the story from my perspective. Since I was in my teens I have always had a habit of just grabbing books where the cover art depicts an interracial couple (let my mother tell it the story of my life). I was very pleased. The story was well developed and unlike some of the other Indigo Love Spectrum authors I have read, the dialogue didn't annoy me, it seemed to read more true. I know of 4 books that i would re-read. This is one of them."
4,"For one of my First IR reads, it was Okay","I did like the story, it was a nice read. I thought Maya's issues on race along with her own personal self esteem issues was valid, but then I didn't understand, as she was a product of an IR relationship, but then again, it is the south and unless your pale, then your considered black. Nick I thought was Naive on the racial issues. But I noticed alot of IR romances have the male not caring and the female character stressing. If you do get this book, it is a nice addition to your collection."
5,Blake Shelton,Blake Shelton the Oklahoma boy. Has made him self two cds so far. They both are very succsessful. They both are very good I have both of them. He has done a very good job with both of his cds so far. I think he always will. He just seems like that kinda guy to always do good in music. Blake can relate to the baby because he is the baby of his family. Blake would not write songs that he would not think people/fans would not like.
5,The Dreamer,"If you loved his debut album you will love The Dreamer. Blake Shelton has found a way to combine the traditional ""old"" country sound with the new ""pop"" sounds of today. I garuntee that there will be at least one song on this album that will hit home with many, whether it be The Baby, The Dreamer, or Someday ... this album will move you ... from tears to laughs."
2,One Song Album?,"The only reason I gave this album two stars is ""The Baby."" As a Blake Shelton fan, I was very let down by this album."
5,Another great CD from Blake Shelton,"This CD contains less evidence of Blake's ""signature wit"". Although ""Georgia In A Jug"" is an amusing song. But Blake's high energy is showcased beautifully in the song ""Heavy Lifting"". His sentimentality on display in ""The Baby"" brought tears to my eyes. This is another great CD from the artist who made me take another look at country music!I was smitten by Blake Shelton's humor during the ""Clash of the Choirs"" and really hoped he would win the contest because of the amazing sound his choir produced. This prompted me to borrow every one of his CDs from the library. WOW! And I am NOT a country music fan! Well, maybe now I am... Blake's humor (and tender heart) comes through loud and clear in his music."
5,Going Postal with my scale,"This product is fine, received everything in a timely manner and it met all my expectations as it was presented."
5,Great Product!,"Great product! Perfect for home use. I am a seller on Ebay and this scale really helps out. Now, I can weigh items so I know how much to charge for shiping."
5,PS100,"I am very pleased with this scale. Easy to use, compact and accurate. I use it to weigh packages that I ship from a home business and it meets my needs 100%."
2,Problematic scale,"A good product overall. However, when you place an item on it to be weighed, first it gives you one reading and then 2 seconds later the final reading. It seems a little strange, as you have to wait about 5 seconds to make sure you are getting the final reading.Would not recommend this scale in the end. It stopped working after some months of use."
2,"Accurate, but difficult to see readout if weighing packages","I had this scale & returned it because I was weighing larger boxes. When the box is on the scale, you cannot see the readout. I'm shopping for a scale with a ""hold"" button or a swing out readout."
5,great scale!,I love this scale and you do not have to worry about it going out of date b/c it only gives the weight. Good purchase.
4,does what it should do,"It works quite well for my purposes. It's consistent and accurate. It take a few seconds for the weight to equilibrate. My only complaint is that the surface is pretty small, so it doesn't work as well for larger items."
1,Didn't work,"I was extremely disappointed in the scale. I purchased it after reading all the good reviews but when I received it, the scale didn't even turn on. It calls for a 9v battery and plugin to operate. I attempted 3 different batteries/2 outlets and nothing worked. I am returning the item."
5,Does the job expected,"Doing small volume eBay business, this scale is just what I needed to allow accurate shipping pricing on my listings. It registers exactly the same as post office scales. I'm very pleased with it. It saves me time and moneyby purchasing my postage on line."
3,Works great if you plug it in!,"Purchased this scale in July and it works fine except for one small problem I encountered today. I needed to use the unit in battery mode for the first time since I purchased it, and discovered that the battery terminals (of my unit at least) do not fit on a standard 9 volt battery.I tried a couple different brands of batteries (not off brands) and neither brands would fit the terminals. I have contacted Amazon regarding this problem, but it is well over the 30 day refund period. Just something you may want to be aware of before purchasing. Oh yeah, this USPS postal scale was made (of course) in China."
4,great product,"This is a great product....I don't have to go to the post office and stand in line, they come to me to get my paackages."
3,Does not tell you what postage to use,This is just a scale. It does not tell you what postage to use. You can get a chart from the post office.
5,USPS PS100 10-Pound Postal Scale,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS POSTAL SCALE. IT IS VERY EASY TO USE, ACCURATE, AND WEIGHS SO LITTLE. THE PORTABLILITY OF THIS ITEM IS A POSITIVE FEATURE. WHETHER I AM PREPARING MERCHANDISE FOR SHIPMENT FROM THE HOUSE OR GARAGE, THIS SCALE ACCOMPANIES ME. THANKS!"
4,Not bad... IF,"This collection of music from the original Bubblegum Crisis videos is on 3 CD's which helps explain the cost. As the title indicates it is a complete collection with all of your favorites. However - the songs are all in Japanese. If you were looking for the songs in English, this is not the CD collection you want."
2,totally crappy,"this book was confusing, and didn't teach anything. it was just a large number of examples."
2,Wiring too short for ATV with battery in the front,Went to install this on a 2011 Grizzy 700 and the wire to connect to the battery was at least 2 feet too short - had to make a trip to Radio Shack to purchase wire and connectors to complete the project - very poor design.
4,The Art Of Aikido,"This isn't the best book for learning techniques, for that I recommend Moriteru Ueshiba's excellent books, but this has some insightful chapters about Aikido philosophy and ideas. It is also good for photographs of the second doshu in action, with some interesting overhead shots. Good for any aikidoka bookshelf but not an essential for beginners.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,The Art of Aikido or dancing?,I was very disappointed with this book. As someone who has taken Japanese Aikido for years it was the photos that were the downfall and made the book useless. You can't tell who is fighting who or the steps that are being used to teach the techinque. I have several books on Aikido but this would be as useful as a square dancing book if you could tell who was who.I'm sorry to give a bad report but I hope this helps others.
4,Happy I have it,"As a big fan of Becky Higgins, this book was a ""must buy"" for me. I have all of her previous books, and really appreciate her beautiful, photo oriented (vs. page embellishment oriented) scrapbook pages. I really liked the Lisa Bearnson pages also. That said, this book seems to have a lot of fluff in it. I wish that instead of beautiful filler pages with pictures of bookshelves and flowers, that there would have been more pages from each scrapbook featured. Sometimes the journaling is too small to read - and the journaling is such an important part of a scrapbook. This book has much less content than Ali Edwards' Designer's Eye for Scrapbooking. Still, a great book and a tool I will use."
4,A Great Lift for Climbing the Ladder to Lucidity Absolute,"I am reading this book simultaneously with Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit/Mind. It serves as a very helpful companion to enrich comprehension of the Phenomenology, specifically by providing an excellent overview of each area of dense terrain you must pass through certain parts of Hegel's densely abstract masterpiece. Hegel is incredibly challenging and almost painful in how much contemplative time and effort are required to grasp the meaning of many passages. However, it is all well worth it. When it begins to sink in, moments of becoming lucid to the self-presence and harmony of Knowing Absolute begin to flicker as sweet reward. H.S. Harris's book helps you get there."
3,unique flavor,"These turkey nuggets have a funky flavor, very different from regular beef jerky. Soft texture, some bites have a bit of fat (?) in them. Probably will not purchase this box of 8 pouches again, it's too big of a shipment for a product with such an unusual flavor."
2,This book is mistitled,"The title of this book should actually be ""Speech making by Ronald Reagan"" because only about 1/4 of the book deals with the battle for Pointe du Hoc. Most of the book champions the speechmaking ability of the former president. The battle description that it does have is pretty dry and lifeless."
1,Not what it seems,"Fewer than 25 pages of this modest history actually deal with the Rangers' assault on Point du Hoc during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. One expected more. Most of the book deals with Ronald Reagan and what the author calls ""the new patriotism."" The writing is too solicitous, too rah-rah to be good military history. I am sorry I bought it."
2,The boys of pointe du hoc,I am very disappointed in this book as it has very little about the fighting and a lot about President Reagan. It needs a new title.
2,Where's the rest of the simulation? It's important!,"The manager or student who does not have the assistance of an 'airline-experienced' professor, the computer software and the additional training material makes this simulation process much more difficult to comprehend, understand and complete. If the publisher and the writer would include the extra material plus the computer software, this could be a great training tool for many airline managers and others.If you must buy this simulation in its present form, consider purchasing Paul Dempsey's book: Airline Management to get through this."
3,Not the best...,"This book is mainly just worksheets/stationery for writing assignments, alphabetized, like ""H is for Hero"". Some were useful, yes, but nothing original or innovative, also they weren't as attractive as in similar books. Thumb through it first and see if it suits your needs, but there is better stuff out there."
2,Not worth the price.,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my niece because it came as a BOX set. I ordered it very early December and received it the day AFTER Christmas. When it arrived, it wasn't even in a box set as described. It was only the first three books from the series. The books were at least in decent condition. I felt like I overpaid for something that was falsely described and was really let down by how long it took to receive it, especially considering it was a Christmas gift for someone."
2,sad,I wasn't really happy with what I received in the mail. I thought I would get all books of the series but they only sent me one!
2,Antiquing,"This was a birthday present for a relative that enjoys ""junking"" or the art of recognizing the value of an item."
1,Holy Gooey Lameness,"This item looks a lot different than pictured...Each pocket is spray-painted black. It looks barely noticeable in this picture (I didn't notice it, I thought I was getting the classic yellow utility belt). It ruins the classic look. It looks like someone tagged each pocket with a big spot of black spray paint.I expected it to be made of fabric -- it does have snaps after all -- but it's made out of the cheesiest-looking soft gooey rubber.The pockets aren't big enough to hold a phone or much of anything really.The buckle is not a buckle.Overall, pretty lame."
1,As if the first one wasn't bad enough,"I'd say more of the same, but this is actually worse than the first ""Wicked Willow"" book. Cliches on top of bad writing and tired old plots.If this is the future of ""Buffy"" then I'll pass.Ill concieved dreck."
1,More of the same old tired plot,"The first book of this series was awful. This one is far worse. I'd normally not want to ""spoil"" anything in a review, but usually don't care in a bad one. But this is so beyond bad I can't even bother.Just don't even buy it. There is nothing of the old ""Buffy"" gang here. The Willow here is a two-dimensional caricature of the Willow on screen. The other characters are even less thought out. Take every character's most annoying personality trait from the failed Season Six and multiply it 10 times and you get an idea of what is going on here.Fan Fic is free, so why bother with this.Want to shock me? Want to get me interested? Write a book that undoes all of Season 6 and 7, keeps Willow from going evil and keeps Tara alive.But no one out there is brave enough, or talented enough to do that. Least of all Ms. Navarro here."
5,Very well written,"Though I'd have preferred a book that would have dovetailed with the show better I have to say Yvonne Navarro is an excellent writer and both ""Wicked Willow"" books were well done and interesting. My main complaint is there is very little Spike. But after the dreadfulness of Heat and the awfulness of 7 Crows I'm just thankful for a couple of really good books."
3,Super Reader,"Giles and company have broken up Willow's coven, and she has to go recruiting. It it is not just witches she comes up with, however, but a golem.The Finns are dead, killed in action, and Willow summons Riley's spirit to help her make a golem as a weapon.A mistake, as Riley is stubborn, and it turns out Buffy can order him around. Scratch a few more wicked witches."
2,Review of video Stepping Out,"I was reasonably satisfied. The video arrived quickly and was as I ordered regarding packaging etc. My only issue is that there is background noise in places and I am concerned that it won't last long. I assume it's an ex-rental, but as it's a musical I would have preferred it not to have background noise."
4,This should have been a hit,"Its ashame,but no one will give Liza a break.This film went right to Video when it was released.I rented this movie and showed it to my friends who are not Liza Minnelli fans,they Loved it.This shouldn't have been a mega hit,but a nice small film that makes you fill good inside. Everyone in the Movie is great,and the tap dancing wants you to start taking tap dancing lessions while your watching the film.Liza was having a great comeback at this time.She was breaking records touring with ""Stepping out""and never looked better. If this happens to be the last Liza Minnelli film,it would be a fantastic last movie from one of the greatest entertainers ever."
4,A Feel Good Film,"This is one of the best ""feel good"" films on the market today. It was sorely under-rated and Liza should have recieved major kudos for it! If you like to smile this is the best film for you."
4,One of the Best Dance Films Ever,"Viewing Stepping Out with my daughter, who is a dancer, has become a wonderful and regular pastime in our house. Liza Minelli is phenomenal in this film whether singing, acting, or dancing. Even though the film is Liza's vehicle, the superb cast of dancing actors holds its own against her talent. Each character reminds us of someone we know. Each character becomes a beloved friend as the plot develops. I'm going to write to Paramount and ask that it be made into a DVD. This lovely film deserves to be preserved for my daughter's daughters! Engaging, funny, dramatic, and full of music, this film is a must-see for fans of all musical theater"
3,Good family Flick,Nothing offensive in this little gem of a heart-warmer. Nicely staged production with Liza showing off some of her considerable talents without dominating a wonderful cast. Nice feel-good / underdog wins movie
3,"Good job, Minnelli!","It's a shame that many think this could be the last Liza movie ever made. It's a small film, slightly flawed, that serves as a showcase for Liza and her dancing abilities. Her supporting cast is unremarkable, with the exception of Shelley Winters. The plot line strays every time Liza is out of the picture. But, it's a likeable movie that will make you want to take tap dancing lessons. Let's just hope that Liza gets better soon, so she can come back to the big screen"
5,LITTLE KNOWN MINELLI,"A real sleeper, but a great show! Minelli and cast excellent, especially for Bill Irwin fans. Not only a top comedian, but a surprisingly good dancer. And Shelley Winters plays her role to the hilt. Wonderful movie for the entire family."
1,I Didn't recieve the item,"Computer Brain is the worst seller in whole world, they never shipped the product, but of course, they billed me.I'll never buy again with Computer BrainComputer Brain es el peor seller de Amazon, Amazon no deberia trabajar con personas tan irresponsables como ellos.Computer Brain nunca envio el producto, aunque si me cobro el item.Nunca compren por Computer Brain."
4,Cute book,"My son likes this book but it's not as good as the ""A"" and ""B"" books. It's still nice to have, I only wish there were more letters."
5,The combination of the three books changed how I live daily,"I have ADD and its always been hard for me to focus on everydaysimple...getting the house in order, spending time being quiet,etc. I read all three books in the same few days, in reverseorder and frankly the content of each distinctive book is jumbledin my mind...however the overall impact has been amazing. For the first time in over 20 years I am in the process of deepcleaning and organizing my home/life and its finally shaping upinto an environment I enjoy. The Sacred in it, the Amish references, the patterning of thought and example given in thethree books hooked to my heart in a way nothing else has before.I am so grateful for these books. I gave them away to a treasured friend tied in a big bow. She was delighted!"
2,disappointed,"I very much enjoyed Plain and Simple, and also Everyday Sacred, so I was expecting a grand finale to a charming trilogy. Instead I encountered self-absorption to an extreme degree and despite the simplicity of the text I simply couldn't get past half way. I think Sue Bender needs to do some volunteer work, or just somehow get out of her own head for a while."
1,Editorial confusion,"I feel really sorry for the student assistants that got credit in the front of Dobb's book for their careful editing. This book has more typos in it than any thing I have ever seen. And if Torts law was not hard enough to understand, having to work within Dobbs sorry typos makes it that much harder. Content wise, the book just does not lay out Torts in any logical order. It is just too hard from this book to pull out what the rule is and whether a case represents the majority view or a minority. Defense arguments against recovery tend to get far less coverage than the plaintiff viewpoint: That much is obvious from the books' subtitle. Overall, it is required that you use a study supplement with this book. I recommend ""Understanding Torts"" by Larry Levine, et al. Don't buy this book unless some sadistic professor is forcing you too."
2,Horrific editing!!!,"I concur with my fellow reviewers that this Casebook contains more typos and grammaticla errors than a first-grader's book-report!! If your Torts prof is excellent (and mine was) such editorial problems won't keep you from getting a good grade. But, to be sure, buy the Examples and Explanations by Glannon and a good commercial outline to supplement this POOR casebook! Finally, I wholeheartedly agree with one of the reviewers who indicated that this casebook is VERY much biased towards the plaintiff's bar and against defendents, businesses, or ""the MAN""."
2,Whatever happened to the classics?,"This has gotta be the LOWEST grammy compilation CD ever released. Do you realize how much they didn't pay attention to the classic groups nominated? I mean, yeah, Sting and James Taylor are on there, but how about DAVID BOWIE (""Slow Burn"", awesome song, and I hope he wins over Springsteen), BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (""The Rising""), PETER GABRIEL, ROBERT PLANT, U2? Come on! Only 2 out of the 18 songs on the CD are dedicated to the old guys. I know this is a new era, but the classic rock bands are making such a strong comeback. They're rediscovering their roots and their music is still so appealing to this very day. Take David Bowie's new ""Heathen"" album, for example. What a striking echo from his past. It's ""Classic Bowie, Circa 2002."" So why not take a glance back to the classic days of old and give some respect to these guys? 2 songs just aren't enough (and those songs are by the ""not-so-hot"" classic musicians!). Give me a break. Give some credit where credit is due!"
1,I'll make this short.,This is horrible. Dont buy any grammy cds or support them. The grammys are horrible.Thats it. I now hate the grammys. Grammys 2004 are also REALLY bad. I wish the grammys were good.
3,Where's The Boss?,"I've always looked forward to the Grammy Nominees CD. After seeing the track list, I may pass on buying it. I was disappointed not to see Springsteen since he was up for 5 nominations including album and song of the year. I agree with the the other reviewers that some of the choices are a little weak. Of course, I thought the nominations and winners were a little weak too."
1,NOT a (Good!) Grammy cd!!!,"I'm sorry, were you looking for the new NOW! cd? Let's face this is NOT a Grammy cd, it's a teeny-bopper pop one. Hello? BRITNEY SPEARS? N*SYNC?I'll give them credit for the Dixie Chicks (""Landslide"") and Norah Jones (""Don't Know Why""), but to call it a Grammy cd is horrible. Hello? ANYONE HEARD OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN?? The ""Grammy favorite"" when this cd was made, and he's got NOTHING here. It's very sad, y'know.Overall, I don't recommend this cd AT ALL! I suggest getting some decent music. Try ""The Rising"" (Bruce Sprinsteen) or ""Home"" (Dixie Chicks) insted.Sorry, Grammy people, it was a hit or miss shot....you missed."
1,Grammy Nominees 2003,"All Grammy Nominees, especially the winners, should be available for sale in your site. Where's Emilio Navaira's music re TejanoI would've bought it if you had it."
1,"People, these are not the ""best of the best""","This CD, along with the awards, has nothing to do with talent. It's all greed. If you like these artists, by all means, by this CD, feed the machine. But, if you want truly amazing music, like another reviewer stated, go buy the latest Wilco, Flaming Lips, or Interpol CD."
1,Terrible choice of tracks,"This cd is geared towards pop music from the year instead of the great music from the year. Crissakes they didn't even have a Bruce Springsteen track. They should rename it ""Peoples Choice Awards 2003"" instead of the grammys. A real dissapointment."
4,overall look at this cd,"01 A THOUSAND MILES Vanessa Carlton B+02 DON'T KNOW WHY Norah Jones B03 HOW YOU REMIND ME Nickelback B+04 LANDSLIDE Dixie Chicks B+05 WITHOUT ME Eminem A06 HOT IN HERRE Nelly A-07 FOOLISH Ashanti A-08 ALL YOU WANTED Michelle Branch B+09 COMPLICATED Avril Lavigne A10 YOUR BODY IS A WONDERLAND John Mayer A11 SOAK UP THE SUN Sheryl Crow A-12 GET THE PARTY STARTED P!nk A13 OVERPROTECTED Britney Spears C+14 7 DAYS Craig David B15 FRAGILE Sting B_01 A THOUSAND MILES Vanessa Carlton B+16 OCTOBER ROAD James Taylor B-17 GIRL ALL THE BAD GUYS WANT Bowling For Soup B18 WHERE ARE YOU GOING Dave Matthews Band A-19 GIRLFRIEND *Nsync BI think that most of these songs are great, and the cd overall gets an A- with me...however, some of these songs like Overprotected and Girlfriend do not even belong on this cd, really. Happy listening!!!"
2,Where is COLDPLAY!!!!,Probably one of the best bands out there... They won an award and also were hyped on the show as they played with the orchestra behind them....No Doubt is not the album of the year .. A Rush of blood to the head is...
2,call it grammy *popular* nominees,"These Grammy Nominee series try to appeal to the most mainstream and popular music listeners. I've never bought these series, although I was tempted because they always had one or two songs that I liked. However, I bought couple years of Grammy Rap Nominees and year of Latin. Sorry, I don't listen to country. It's not that I love rap and latin over others, but there are better representation of nominated music in these specialized series and not just because the artists are popular.I wish they could make double CD to make them pack enough songs that I really like. Or, it's still better to go buy the CD of the artist themselves - if the original album is strong enough.The CD however would make a ... safe gift. It's also a good CD if you don't follow music and want to hear what's popular.I'd give three stars, but I don't like this year's songs as much."
1,The Grammy's..A Pathetic Parody of Their Former Self...,"Some of the most over-hyped musicians of the year were mysteriously no where to be found at this years Grammy's. The White Stripes,The Flamming Lips...some of the best new bands of the year...not one nomination, but in their place we have Nickelback? No Johnny Cash..but middle of the road artists like John Mayer? NSYNC??? Britney Spears..but no Kylie or Sophie Ellis Bextor? WHERE WAS BECK?!!The Grammy's people have no idea what they're doing. Im 16 years old and im pretty confident I could have done a better job than this."
5,Beautiful,"I listen to a wide variety of music, and I think that Alison Krauss has the most beautiful voice in all of today's music. The pop acts of today can't compare. ""I've Got That Old Feeling"" has 12 exceptional songs from bluegrass to country including the title song, ""It's Over"", and ""Wish I Still Had You"". Not only can Krauss sing, she plays the violin to perfection. If you haven't listened to Alison Krauss yet, you are in for a treat!"
2,"ok, but...","Pros: the sword arrived fast and the packeaging was fine,Cons: the sheath for the sword is not wood, its just cardboard and wrapping, and the sword sometimes will not fit. the tang (the piece of metal that connects the sword to the handle) is weak and brittle.the circular guard is not even attached and sometime will wobble around freely when held, even though this is a decorative sword the craftsmanship is low almost everything is just flat 1 color metal."
1,Original vocals??,"As a big Disney Princess fan, I'm rather upset that for this CD, the vocal versions of the tracks are NOT performed by the original voice actresses who played each Princess. It's almost like buying a karaoke CD with tracks of people singing along to the karaoke provided! Either include the original vocals for the song, or don't include them at all, Disney."
5,Love this brush,"I used to buy this brush at the grocery store, but they quit carrying them over four years ago. The only place I can find them is online. I like them much better than any I can find at the store."
4,Lots I can use,"I teach 6th grade math and had been looking for engaging handouts I could use with some of my students. This fits the bill. Getting reps is essential to improving math skills, but students often don't want to do the work. The work presented as riddles and puzzles taps into many of my students intrensic motivations."
5,"Steeljack's story is another ""Astro City"" triumph","""Kurt Busiek's Astro City: The Tarnished Angel"" is another fine graphic novel in the outstanding ""Astro City"" series. This seven-chapter story is about Steeljack, a metal-encased supervillain. Released from prison at the book's start, he is hired by a criminal kingpin to find out who is murdering other supervillains.This is a powerful, rich, complex story. Steeljack's tale is intertwined with that of a number of other fantastic characters: whip-wielding Latino superhero El Hombre, high-tech British supervillain the Mock Turtle, and more. Many characters from the other Astro City volumes (Samaritan, Winged Victory, etc.) also make appearances.Sort of a world-weary loser, Steeljack is a compelling, memorable protagonist. ""Tarnished Angel"" is full of great visuals, heroic battles, and moving human drama. The book as a whole is a fascinating look at the Astro City milieu from its dark side."
5,"Ok, Ok, I'm Getting To It!","Imagine you are a villain in a world of supermen (and women).Imagine you have been in and out of prison for as long as you can remember and now all you want to do is lay low...Then Imagine you see old friends killed off one by one in your old neighborhood, the only neighborhood you ever knew.What comes next?This is a very intense, downbeat tale of a super powered bad guy who has seen the error of his ways, but still feels a kinship to his old comrades in the bad guy business..Extremely well written, and, in my humble opinion, well drawn as well. Read it and judge for yourself, this is an engaging piece of work!"
4,Sensational Scenes for kids: The Scene Study=Guide for Young Actors,"There were not many books around when my daughter was diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder. I learned to use role playing as a way to teach behaviors to my daughter with autism. This book gave me the clues to do that. Read our journey through autism, Coming Through the Fog.[[[...]]]"
5,Very Helpful,This book has a great variety of scenes to study and has been very helpful in getting my son's career going. He has worked for both Disney and Nickelodeon and I believe Chambers has helped with his success. Keep up the good work!
3,Ghost Towns,Purchased as a gift for someone who is difficult to buy for. He was very pleased and the purchase was very easy for me.
3,air compressor,"The air compressor works great. I have 2 of them. they both have a similar problem........THe nipple that the air hose plugs into, is not a standard type air nipple.....so, if i want to change hose types, from the cheesy included hose, I have to take the head off the compressor, and get a npt pipe tap, and re-thread the head. The 2 compressors I have, both have different types of nipples,and the threaded nipple is not a standard npt thread........ so the hoses are not compatiable with one another. Whoever does the quality control should know this, and get someone to look at this problem. I won't buy another one."
4,"Good cheapie unit, i will keep it handy","Just got my hands on one of these..I have 39.5""x13.50-15 swampers..My ac compressor on board air setup has a locked compressor and my tire went flat..Plugged this baby in and it took 4 mins to airup the huge tire to 20 psi.. Its not all that loud but the factory hose section got really hot after use..IF you need cheap on board air this with a small 10 gallon or 5 gallon tank would be pimp."
4,good for the cash,"Good little compressor for most every thing. Airs up bike tires in less than 1 second. It is a little slow for my 33"" tires on the Jeep, but doubt you could find anything better without spending another $100 +"
5,handy and excellent,the master flow 1050 is an excellent tool and a life saver when your equipment has to roll as mine does on the farm
1,Master Flow MF-1050 Portable Air Compressor,"The only good thing that I can say about this product is, it's cute. It was totally unsatisfactory for my purposes. I have an RV that requires 80 PSI tire pressure. This unit wouldn't cut it. I connected the compressor to my tire with the existing pressure at 71 PSI. I turned the pump on and the 30A fuse blew immediately. I changed the fuse with the supplied spare. Same result. I disconnected the air hose from the tire and turned the pump on and it worked with out any back pressure. I attempted one more time to get it to work with the same result. This could have been just a faulty compressor but who needs the frustration."
5,I can't see how it can get better than this !,"I got my compressor today It ran great with no issues. I took a standard air coupling from home depot and it snapped right on with no problems ,so making another hose should be no big deal., now that I have it I feel that I will not have to use it ,but the one time I do, it will pay me back bigtime. This unit is about the best you're going to find"
1,Poor Quality-Not worth the risk.,"I ordered this item in late-June and made the mistake of not using it until now (early October). The product quality is lackluster at best. The permanent crimped fittings on the hose do not make proper seals and the 'rapid' connector from the hose to the compressor failed to seal properly as well. After 2 hours of trial and error between myself and a friend (a retired mechanic), we gave up on this unit as we witnessed its complete inability to inflate any tire. Sadly, the return window expired in July and I am now stuck with an expensive piece of junk. It was my mistake for not thoroughly testing the unit upon initial shipment. Lesson learned."
4,vinny,this product works. the medication really help with parasites that causes breathing problem. make sure you remove the carbon filter. best result put the infected fish in a separate isolation tank
3,"Has not yet gotten rid of leeches, and has a cancer-causing ingredient","Yes, leeches in an aquarium. Ugh. But this is supposed to kill them. According to the fish boards it is one of the only things that kills them.I treated once the first time and still saw another leech (a little one... one inch long) a couple of weeks later. Just re-treated two days in a row and have not seen one yet.By the way... this product has a chemical known the state of California to cause cancer. Don't use it unless you have to. It does also treat ich, but there are way better, safer products for treating ich, likeSeachem ParaGuard 250ml."
4,Works like magic,"It was unclear what was killing my fish, but this took care of it. Seems like the best value out there if you have a large tank to treat. Only downside it that it will turn silicone blue. The blue color of the water fades after a day or two."
4,Every turtle needs their rat master,"This is the figure based on Splinter from the new TMNT movie. The figure comes with a walking stick and a grappling hook weapon. It has multiple points of articulation, though due to the robes it cannot bend at the waist.The new figures look a lot like their movie counterparts, and Splinter is no exception. There is a slight concern that his tail and beard could break off if you're not careful, but they're made of reasonably flexible plastic and should stand up to play. I like how they've tied off the string on the grappling hook weapon so that it doesn't get into annoying tangles. About the only con is that Splinter can't bend at the knees, so you can't sit the figure down. He's gonna be leaning on that cane a lot.If you buy the Turtles, you need a Splinter for them as well. Recommended."
5,Compelling,"This book reaches well beyond connecting with those who have experienced a similar loss. It is a compelling story for everyone to read who wants to experience a full life. The emotions that the author feels while going through her process are unfiltered, and real beyond what is politically correct in these circumstances. It is as if I were living in her mind and heart -- as if the experience was my own. This is the only book I have read in one sitting in a long time -- I couldn't put it down!"
2,"OK, but not great","We bought this for our snowboarding 11-year-old son. Being used to Playstation and Gamecube, he wasn't impressed with the graphics and control of the characters is very clunky. It's a cool concept-- but it needs more time in development."
3,This book is history,"This book is a classic, in fact the author's PhD thesis created this field, but this book is too old for any meaningful graduate work. There are new bounds and algorithms on almost all topics, which makes this a somewhat undesirable book. Also, this book has failed to keep me interested in it, while I am reading it..."
4,"A very good book, but difficult to understand !","The book is comprehensive in computational geometry, and is suitable for research. But really difficult to understand. A student is difficult to read it without teacher's teaching. But people who research in computational geometry need the book."
5,easy fun,This product is very durable.I have it on concrete.Little tikes makes toys pretty good anyways.Everyone loves it
5,"Good job, Dad!","He created something where nothing existed before, providing deep insight into how marine mammals process nutrients and oxygen. As the chemistry of our oceans continues to change, this work is all the more important."
2,Lots of information/poor index,"Positives:Contains a huge amount of information - cites many, many studies.Negatives:Difficult to find the information because the subject index is so short and undetailed.Also, I often had to reread whole paragraphs to get their meaning. This is partly due to the author's preference for complex sentence structure; partly due to the APA citation style which forces authors to cram huge citations into the middle of sentences."
5,"A no-nonsense guide packed with basic etiquette considerations, questions-and- answers, and general advice","The Back Stage Guide To Broadway is a no-nonsense guide packed with basic etiquette considerations, questions-and- answers, and general advice specifically for New York City theatre-goers, whether they are residents or tourists. From when and how much to tip, how to dress for the theatre and what to expect when there, famous and important personages to be aware of, how to get a refund if one's trip is cancelled, reviews of more than 60 theatre-related restaurants and 20 hotels close to theatres, and much more, The Back Stage Guide To Broadway has everything a theatre patron needs to know. A highly specialized travel guide that is nonetheless outstanding and a ""must-read"" for first-time Broadway visitors."
2,Useless without Audio tapes,"This is a great textbook to teach Thai speakers English as a Second Language. However, it is not clear in the description of this book that the $90 audio tapes are also needed. That's why there are two different versions. One at $20, book only, and one at $110 (book and tapes). BTW, who has a tape player anymore?!"
2,Too fragile,"This is an exquisite piece - but it's too fragile. When in arrived it was broken into many pieces and Amazon immediately shipped a replacement. I've only had the replacement out of the box and on display since Christmas day, and when I went to move it today the pillar candle fell over and three of the crystal petals broke off. That's not acceptable."
5,Beautiful centerpiece for any table,Received these along with the matching candlestick holders as a Christmas gift. Can't wait to use and display this; very pretty and elegant. Thought there would be a little more sparkle on the crystal but they are still beautiful and I am very pleased.
3,"Better choices, better album!",I was prompted to buy this album from the TV show An evening on Broadway with Bryn Terfel and Renee Fleming. Maybe I was seduced by the vision but I was disappointed with the audio CD because it doesnt seem to have the enthusiasm that was with the TV audio. If I'd heard this on FM I probably wouldnt have bought it.
3,Lush But Uneven Crossover,"Although Renee Fleming and Bryn Terfel are as great as they come in opera, this ""crossover"" album is uneven.Terfel is more successful in this repertoire, while Fleming over-sings on certain tracks. She is most succesful in 'Hello Young Lovers', and a medley from 'Passion', both of which accomodate her glamorous vocalism. Her wonderful and very different jazz voice does come through splendidly on her selection from 'Parade'.Bryn Terfel is strong throughout, and shines in his Sondheim selections. Their marvellous duet of 'Wheels of a Dream' is their most succesful, if again, operatic.Orchestrations are lush, diction is crystal clear, and the repertory is varied and interesting. This is a well produced, carefully assembled cd. But one hears opera in the Broadway, and therefore the cd will not have universal appeal.Recommended primarily for the curious, those who enjoy crossover/pop-opera, and for fans of Fleming and Terfel."
4,"Sondheim, Fleming and Terfel too..","Someday, if they are not already doing it, singers will program Sondheim next to Schubert and Wolf in their song recitals. If you ever thought of Sondheim as a ""talky"" composer, more concerned with words than music, listen to what Renee Fleming, possessor of a truly great trained voice, does with two of his songs from ""Passion.""So many impressions happen all at once you can barely keep track of them...the sheer natural beauty of the voice, the amplitude with which she fills out the music, every phrase sung as music, but with the words given their full due. Even more than that, the meaning behind those words are explored by a perceptive, intelligent woman whose views you are anxious to hear. These two songs alone are worth the price of the disc.Bryn Terfel also has a voice of great power and beauty, however next to Fleming, the interpretations seem generic and confined to the surface. Any well trained baritone could duplicate his work here, Fleming is one of a kind."
5,Under the stars,"This is crossover how I like it. After hearing Fleming's really not good ""Somewhere"" I worried about this recording but her Christine and Fosca (Passion) swept all my doubts and fears away. Luscious, creamy with perfect diction and much involvement! WOW! Terfel sounds magnificent as Raoul!! If you love those two or if you're just a Musicalfan, this is the one to buy!"
1,"Dreadful, absolutely dreadful","Dreadful, absolutely dreadful. With the sole exception of ""I Don't Remember You""/""Sometimes a Day Goes By,"" the rendering of the songs on this CD is simply atrocious. Renee Fleming sounds as though she's been drugged, and the arrangements could not have been dopier. They go from atonal to off-key; all the songs sound like dirges. I didn't even recognize ""So in Love"" - had to check the menu on the back to figure out what it was. And who on earth selected the songs to be included? With few exceptions (including the song in French!), they seem to represent the most obscure, outré output of Broadway composers, too precious by half. Weird doesn't come close to describing several contributions (""I Wish I Could Forget Loving You,"" ""How Could I Ever Know,"" ""All the Love I have"") - these might be great songs rendered by other singers and/or other arrangers, but as presented on this CD they are simply terrible,I deeply regret buying this CD."
3,some great....some horrible,"hmmm...this is interesting. terfel (overall) does very well and crosses over significantly more successfully. Renee however, has much more trouble. moonfall and how could i ever know are her highlights i think, but some just don't work. for example, ""all the wasted time"" is horrific. to make it less frightening, at least it should have been kept as a duet. but that song was absolutely terrible. to do the song justice, buy a copy of jason robert brown's parade and hear carolee carmello and brent carver soar!"
2,A cautious hit and a huge miss,"Bryn Terfel does really beautifully with the crossover into the classic broadway repertoire. His Rogers and Hammerstein album is a good example of this. He plays it very straight on this album, which I appreciate. The diction is clear, the approach appropriate, the sound thrilling as allways.Rene Fleming, however, continues her gradual descent into schlock. During the last few years, she has consistantly managed to squelch her extraordinary voice and musical gifts through her breathy attacks, horrendous scooping, and lazy phrasing. It doesn't matter whether its bel canto or broadway, she sings it all exactly the same - swooning and breathy. Perhaps she just needs medical attention, but to me it just sounds artificial and insincere. Cheesy is the adjective that comes to mind.Blech. In my humble opinion, you should only buy this album if you are a huge Terfel fan who cannot deal with having an incomplete collection of his work."
3,It worked for me (mostly),"Here's one crossover album by opera stars that works--at last 75% of it, which isn't bad.Surprisingly, Welsh bass-baritone Terfel is often better than the American-born Fleming, especially ""Pretty Women"" and ""Sometimes a Day Goes By"" (although his attempt at a number from The Music Man was a mistake). Fleming does beautifully by ""Moonfall"" (from Edwin Drood) and especially ""All the Wasted Time"" (from Parade), but surprisingly comes up empty with ""Hello, Young Lovers."" Her duets with Terfel that are the best things on the CD. ""Not While I'm Around"" (from Sweeney Todd) is breathtaking, as is ""Wheels of a Dream"" (from Ragtime), ""How Would I Know"" (from The Secret Garden), and ""All I Ask of You"" (from Phantom of the Opera."
1,"Okay, They're Having Fun...But Is Anyone Else?","What happened? Between the over-the-top arrangements, the drab selection of songs (""Aimer"" anyone?), and Renee Fleming's bizarre vocal gymnastics, this disc is pretty much a misfire from start to finish. What's with Ms. Fleming's swooping and scooping; the odd, Southern-inflected dialect? If I didn't know better, I'd think she were giving us a parody of the Rotten Crossover Artist. And Mr. Terfel, so successful in his own previous forays into this material, too often lowers himself to her level. Some of the numbers (from ""Sweeney Todd"" & ""The King and I""), where some restraint is shown, are better than others, but most are pretty awful. Certain to please neither Broadway nor opera fans."
1,shoot the arrangers!,"What a disappointment. This should be a great CD, but it isn't. And what's the problem? The arrangements suck. Talented singers, excellent songs, and the most annoying, tedious, and disruptive arrangements you've ever heard."
4,Cooling isn't all it's cracked up to be.,"This product if not put on careful can be streaky. However, I do like the smell and the results are good. I have been tanning for a long time and would say this product is good if you are use to using bronzers."
5,Outstanding resource,Fr. Leonard Foley's books is an outstanding resource for those who want to understanding the Catholic faith. Fr. Leonard approaches the faith with well founded knowledge and deep spirituality. He speaks to those who search for the meaning of their faith with gentleness and wisdom. This book will lead readers/seekers to a deeper relationship with the Lord.
3,More Variety Would Be Nice,"Magic Slim is certainly a talented guitarist, & his world-weary vocals are well-suited to the blues. I first caught onto him after hearing a few of his more recent songs. But the more I hear him, it becomes obvious that the band recycles the same exact bouncy, rocking rhythm over and over. It makes for some very enjoyable music---for awhile. But eventually it does become old. He does throw in a slow blues, but primarily relies on the same formula throughout the set."
2,disappointed,This did not work for me. May have taken away some of the smell but far from all of it.
2,Did it work?,I had a leather jacket that had a peculear odor. I emptied the entire can of Odorzout into a plastic bag and put the jacket in the bag and sealed. Left in for a week. When I took it out jacket still had same odor. Used the stuff in the cat litter box. Don't know if it helped or not.
1,What the heck...?!,"As shown on my review on''HELLBLAZER:FREEZES OVER'',I loved that comic-book.So,when I bought this one,I had very high expectations.But,heck,was I wrong...This comic-book(at least for me)is one of the worst comic-books ever published.It's amazingly sick,but in a really bad and stupid way,making you want to puke at almost every page.It reminded me a lot the ''SHADOW-MAN''comics(I think that's how they're named),a comic series that I never apreciated.I found the artwork a bad mess too..."
5,Best of the Travel Phrase Books,"I teach an ""Italian for Travel"" class and picked this as our required book. I've looked through all the phrase books and think this is the best organized and most comprehensive one on the market while still being quite small and easily portable. The pages are coated and the cover is plastic protected, which makes it excellent for ordering meals and taking in a backpack. The illustrations are especially helpful (like the illustrated car with all the parts labeled) as are the cultural tips. The ""sign language"" guide is a little silly (please don't use their ""I don't care"" gesture as it is very rude), and a few expressions are not widely used or current, but overall it is quite excellent. The grammar guide in the back is also helpful and pretty user-friendly."
2,not for a small yard,This product attracts flies by the swarm. I am inexperienced in composting but after the experience with this one I probably wont ever compost again unless I live on an acre or more of land so I dont have to have flies buzzing around my living space. It also leaves a bad odor in the air.
1,Don't throw away your money,"I've been grooming for 5 years and this trimmer is the absolute worst grooming tool that I have ever used. Oster should reimburse everyone that has ever purchased this product. Oster normally offers a great product. They dropped the ball on this trimmer. On a scale of 1 to 5, I would not even give it a 1. This trimmer is a HUGE ZERO."
1,Cannot replace the battery,"I haven't used this product as extensively as a professional groomer, but the battery would not recharge. I tried to replace the battery, but it's not replaceable. There a small screw that I removed, but I couldn't take the product a part. I finally just pulled it apart and I think I broke the plastic. Then I say that there was a 5D battery and it was attached to the chassis. I took the clipper and dumped it in the garbage. I agree with the previous reviewer that Oster should reimburse anyone who has bought this product. It wasn't cheap."
1,choppy,Does not give a smooth clean grooming for long haired dogs. choppy and uneven cut. Not a useful trimmer.
1,"Jarden and Amazon super great, , product not so much","Purchasing mistake. This purchase was my mistake in Clicking on the wrong button. However, this is not a highly rated product, which is why I did NOT want to order it. I felt really stupid until I discover I'm not the only one to have made this mistake.Jarden was quick to accept the return and refund my account immediately, even though the reason was my mistake.So, for future on-line purchases, I will definitely look for Jarden Consumer Solutions for any product I need that they supply. Great to do business with."
1,BUT KV has been very cooperative!,"I was completely disappointed in the product but completely satisfied with KV Vet's customer service on this item. I have bought many, many items from KV since then and have nothing but positive things to say about them.But find another set of clippers at Petsmart or somewhere you can really look at them."
5,A is for Amazing!,"My 3 year old stepson begs his dad or I to read him this book nearly every day. And of course he has already memorized it, so when we try to change the words to tease him, he comes back with ""no no, that's not what it say..."". I can't wait for the next 2 to arrive."
1,Handle Too Short,The handle is too short. You'll burn your arm over a hot grill. Not much more to say. Buy a brush with a longer handle.
2,Not Quite Up to the Task,"This brush has proven to be a bit small to clean the grill adequately. The handle is short, so I need to be careful if the grill is hot. The bristles are much too small and it got clogged with grease and ash pretty quickly. Not recommended except perhaps where small size is preferable to quality."
1,The handle and softness are a problem.,"I bought this to replace an old BBQ brush. But what a surprise - this new brush is way less effective than the current worn 5 year old brush. First of all the handle is way too short - 6 inches shorter than my current brush - too short to use when the grill is lighted. Moreover, the cleaning brush is so soft it cleaning power is very limited. It is surprisingly poorly engineered and a big purchase mistake."
2,TOO SHORT!!,"The brush is simply too short to be used with a grill. Even after turning down the grill down lower, I still burned a ton of the hair off of my hands trying to get the rack clean. The only way you can use the item is to just clean your grill after it cools."
4,Good Brush for the price,This is a good sturdy brush. Worth the money. I will buy this again if I ever need one. It fits perfectly on the hooks on my grill and cleans very good.
4,grilling is great when cleaning is easy,Used for about 3 weeks now. Cleans much better the the past few grill brushes. Seems like it should last longer.
2,Tiny Brush,"Very small grill brush. Be prepared to smell the burning hair from your hands... unless you wax your hands, and if you do that you should probably be shopping for self help books instead of a grill brush..."
1,Do not waste your money!,This is not worth ANY money in my opinion. The metal fibers from the brush head were coming out all over my grill when I tried to use it. I can just imagine one getting in my burgers!
2,Works but...,This does the job but the handle is way too short. Would not buy again because of this fact and would pay more for something with a longer handle.
5,normal brush,"This grill brush is just a normal grill brush, wire bristles and all. Nothing different about it, just convenient to order with other BQ items, and have delivered at the same time. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a grill brush."
2,Too small,Not really worth it - it's plastic and small. Spend your money on a nicer heavy duty one that will last.
3,Good enough for the price,The bristles are little soft compared to othersOne can expect to use it for a season.But for the price it's OK.
3,Does the job,Husband says it gets 3 stars. It does the job. Not exceptional. You get what you pay for. I personally liked the price.
1,Bristles break off,"Have used this brush for 2 months and the bristles keep breaking off, getting on the grille surface and into the food. Must be extremely dangerouis. Just threw it out because I don't know of any way to fix this issue."
2,Get what you pay for/beware of eating bristles,I bought this one because I saw the good reviews here. Good brush for about 3.5 months. After that it started losing bristles all over the grill surface. I'm just glad I noticed them before ingesting them and I certainly wouldn't buy another because of this health hazard.
2,Not a good brush,This is my first review I've written. I'm writing this due to the overwhelming lack of quality of this purchase.The bristles on the brush are clumpted together and go in little holes in the brush. The bristles fan out from the holes they are inserted to making a fairly wide spread of bristles. Well almost 8 of the clumpted together bristles have fallen out on the first use. Maybe I'm rougher than most (doubt it) but I would not recommend this product! Buy cheap >> Get cheap
1,Junk!,On its 5th use a clump of bristles came out of the head & onto my grill gratings. DO NOT BUY! No quality control.
3,Too short,Even though this brush has brass bristles the handle is short. We usually scrape and brush the grill after cooking while the grill is still warm. You will burn your hand and melt the plastic handle if you do this. This brush would be good for brushing mud off the bottom of your shoes. We are ordering a longer handled brush.
4,This is a great buy,Works well for the low price. The handle is a little short hence the 4 * instead of 5.
3,OK,"Typical plastic wire brush. Handle long very long, but it works OK. Nothing to rave about. Nice to get it via UPS instead of driving to the hardware store."
2,Tiny brush,I was thinking a grill brush would be larger than this. That's one of the things that you have to be careful of when buying online I guess. Live and learn.
2,Not worth the Price offered. Found cheap once in Walmart with better quality,My bad i did not explore much bought this based on more no. of reviews.I found a better quality with longer Wooden handle around $4 in Walmart.Not sure which reviews to believe now !!!
5,Grill Brush,Does the job and well made and it will last a long time. Rubbermaid lives up to its reputation! Good price too.
3,Short Handle,the handle is a little shorter than I am used to and may burn your hand when trying to clean a hot grill. Bristles look sturdy enough but haven't tried it out yet.
4,Good for the price,"Bought a couple of these for summer grilling. They work fine, but after one summer, I had to toss it, as the bristles had begun to wear down...to the point of not doing much good."
4,nice shorter handle brush,The length of the handle worked real good on my char-broil grill. If it was any longer it would catch when i closed the door.
2,Too Short,If this brush had a longer handle it would be great. The picture is deceiving. You won't like using this on a hot grill.
4,Rubbermaid grill brush looks good,"Don't know if this product will do the job and it will depend on how it holds up, haven't used it yet."
5,The Berenstain Bears on the Moon,This book is so cute and so much fun! We borrowed this book from our local library and then I just had to own it. My kids didn't want to return it to the library. The story line is so cute and it rhymes too which gives it a fun rhythmic sound as you read it aloud. Great book!
4,Fun book,"Another one of the Berenstain Bears Early Readers.It's a lot of fun to read, and the rhymes work well. Very bouncy. I do have to suspend the disbelief of even the kidlets a little - they know full well that two children and a dog cannot go to the moon alone! - but that's all right."
5,Elvis DVD's,My 9 year old daughter thinks that Elvis is great. I was looking for DVD's of some of his movies and found this DVD on Amazon. I am very pleased with the DVD and was pleased with the shipping time.
1,Movie Songs not CC,Why would you advertise a movie (a musical no less!) as Closed Captioned and not caption the words to the Songs????? Crazy!
1,Not strictly by the numbers,"The book promises a strictly numerical approach to exotic selections but more than one winning example was the result of a ""by the number"" horse that ""looked"" poorly conditioned being replaced in the exotic bet by a non-numerical selection that ""looked"" fit and ready.Very difficult for most people to correctly make that assessment at the track and impossible to make it at simulcast. The system may still have some merit but I've not had the chance to test it. However, I've seen a similar approach on another type of exotic bet in a book by Al Ilich ""How to Pick Winners"". The difference is that Al packs his book with lots more information on other aspects of racing.Sorry but this book's promise is misleading and it's sorely overpriced. Do I feel like I've been taken? You can bet on it!"
1,"An Entertaining Read, but not much else.","This was one of the most enjoyable horse race betting books that I have read. Unfortunately, Mr. Cromie's system is to follow the smart money assuming that there is some inside information being hidden in the Pick 3.I have tried this system for a few weekends, and was disappointed with the results.It's still an entertaining book, but don't expect much more."
2,Kind of disappointing,"This book is not worth the ... plus shipping I paid for it. I expected much more, I already knew most of the stuff that was in the book and really didn't find anything of value here. The system used in this book, is really a crap shoot. I tried the methods and didn't have much luck with it. I went back to my usual handicapping, which is analyzing pace, speed and pedigree and current condition of the horse and started winning again."
5,MY charity fund,"Reviewer middletown, de United States either believes he is e e cummings or can't spell. Furthermore, what use is a system that runs through the numbers then says to look at the horses and possibly add the chalk? The use of a realistic system like that is to cash at the window more often. If I could pick winners just by looking at them I wouldn't have bought his book or used his system either, but since I did I've been able to leverage the facts he points out. Not only do I save by not needing the forms and not spending hours studying the sheets, I save by cashing more winners than I ever did before. If you buy this book for the price of a trifecta ticket consider that your first winner of many to come"
1,richard a. cromie charity fund,"what use is a system that runs you through various situations,then says,""if the chalk looks-like he's sitting on a big race,add him to equation""!he says this in way to many instances for me! if i could pick winners by looking at them i wouldn't need a book or his system! if you buy this ,your just paying for one of mr.cromie's box trifecta tickets! stay clear at all costs!"
5,This bike is so fun!!!!!,First of all I like watching the x games and espn.Also my favorite colors are red and black.So this is the bike for me.And its the kind of bike I was looking for.
1,espn bike,"I got this bike about 5 days ago and the rear wheel makes a wierd noise + my chain broke off. Don't get me wrong, this bike rides great but I calculated that espn bike + riding = broken."
2,Not that good...,"Wrote a review the other day and I had a bit different views on this bike. I did like it, but now..... After a week of owning it, I returned the bike. The wheels started to wobble and brakes began to rub more. Adjusted brakes more to get them not to rub and then I had no brakes. I then turned bike upside down and started looking at rear axle. It was bent, from what I have no clue. All I did on the bike was ride it on road. No jumps, no hills, just rode it. I then noticed a clunk noise in the left side of crank. Tried my best to find the noise and could not locate it. Like I said in the first review its ok not great. I loaded the bike up and took it back. After a week with it the quality was low in my honest opinion. For the money its not worth it. If the bike was like 60 to 80 bucks it would have been fine. But for a bike that cost 139 way to much for this bike. Pick a different bike instead of this one..."
4,Decent product for a great price,"I was looking for a 4ft cable for a very reasonable price, and it really fit the bill. The retracting mechanism can be finicky if not used as designed. Make sure to pull on *both* ends at the same time to pull the wire out and while retracting it, also make sure both the ends are free to reel-in without obstruction. If you do that, it works pretty well."
1,This product is terrible,"It technically functions as a USB cable, but the very instant I first pulled one side out of the autospooler, the thing became tangled. As I pulled one end out, the whole thing began unspooling in the middle. When I tried to retract it, that set the failure in stone, so to speak. It's ridiculous. I can't believe this was ever tested successfully. Do not buy."
5,If you like hot picking and killer harmonies do not miss.,"This album has everything. They mix it up to follow the ""pick one, sing one"" formula. Tony and Norm are joined by Doc Watson on awesome renditions of Salt Creek, Blackberry Blossom, and Lost Indian. On the songs, Tony and Norm sing really tight harmonies together, and the whole album is chock full of great licks. I highly recommend this album to any Blake and Rice fans, and especially to any flatpickers."
4,hot,"this cd is tyte,it has some good beats. Freeway can rap with the best of them. If u like jay z u like freeway"
2,Horrible,"This CD was garbage. Even If you buy it just to hear Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel, don't but it. ""What We Do"" is the tightest song on here, and you can but that single if you want it that bad."
4,Freeway The Philly Rappers Debut,Here is the song by song review of Freeways Rookie Album.1.Free-good song sounds like ODB 9/102.What we do-all 3 come correct this is great 10/103.All my life-Great 10/104.Flipside-Freeway Peedi does not 8/105.On my own-okay 6/106.We get away-he screams a little to much pretty good 8/107.Don't cross the Line-good Beat I like this one 10/108.Life-Pretty Tight all the way through 10/109.Full Effect-80s style Production for Rocky 9/1010.Turn off the Lights-not that great 5/1011.Victim of the Ghetto-Pretty Tight 10/1012.You Don't know(in the ghetto)-I like 10/1013.Alright-I think it was a single pretty good 10/1014.Here the song-70s soul feel 10/1015.You got me-f MC and Jay Z its good 9/1016.Line em up-Okay 8/10This is and above average album here is the reviewLyrics 8/10 Production 8/10 X Factor 8/10 Style 8/10 Voice 7/10Music 8/10 Innovative 7/10 Classic 7/10 Guest 8/10 Blends 9/10Overall 78 wich is 4 Mics 78-83 ****
4,FREEWAY,"solid cd. Life, free, flipside, victim of ghetto, what we do, line them up, it's alright, joint w/ faith and snoop, full effect are hot"
3,1st Album A Bust?,"Philadephia Freeway's lyrical presence is well known, and we may all know that he is definetely a great MC with potential to climb near the top. However, this will not go down as one of the 'debute-greats.' Too many guest appearances of commercial stars such as Nelly, Snoop Dogg, Beanie, Bleek, Jay-Z, Nate Dogg and others detract from Freeway's ability to tell his story. Perhaps less guest appearances would make this debut great, but ill stick to the 3 stars i gave it."
2,bad,"this is bad... the production isnt that great one of them is the welcome to new york city beat but worse and freeway is just bad on it, don't buy it"
1,Freeway sucks Monkey Balls,Am I the only one or do you stupid people not realize that freeway DOES NOT RHYME. He is absolutlety terrible. How the hell did he ever get a record deal. This is the worst piece of garbage that I have ever heard. He makes lil wayne look like a lyrical genuis. I hope you people feel ashamed of ourselves. My ass creates better music when i am on the toilet then this pathetic attempt at a rapper does. Really you suck if you think freeway has got skills. I would name people who are better lyrically but I would be here all day or possibly all year. Freeway sucks monkey balls. Peace
4,freeway is dope,yo this freeway album is hot once it is coming from a rocafella camp you know the beat will be hot with just and kayne any way this album is hot people need to listen to free and give him a chance there at leat 12\16 track hots and don't talk about flipside the track just blaze is the man nuff respect.
4,The Roc's best in a while,"Ive been waitin so long for this cd to drop.. and the wait was worth it! Free delivers an amazing solo LP! The only complaint i have is that he has too many guests. Although pretty much every track is tight he doesnt give himself enough mic time. This cd is more like a big mixtape. But it is still worth every cent.The Standout tracks are:""What we do"" ft. Beanie Sigel and jay-z""Flipside"" ft. Peedi Crakk""Dont cross the line"" ft. Faith Evans""Life"" ft. Beanie Sigeland ""Hear the sound""."
5,Great Debut Album,"Freeway has a great debut album! With most of the production credited to Just Blaze, Freeway can hold his own as a solo artist. Being a devouted Sunni Muslim makes it all the more interesting also.Of course, ""What We Do"" should be everyone's favorite! But I also like ""You Got Me"" feat. Maraih Carey (Maraih hit some high notes in this joint which gives it a plus) and Jay-Z, ""Alright"" feat. Allen Anthony and ""All My Life"" feat. Nate Dogg. I got to hand it over to Just Blaze one more time, he does the damn thing with those bangin' beats! That's why Freeway's crazy and unorthodoxed lyrics easily goes hand in hand with Just Blaze.There are other guest apperances such as Nelly, Snoop Dogg and a track called ""Don't Cross The Line"" feat. Faith Evans.Don't pass this up! This is a good CD to play along with 50 cent's CD."
4,This cd is crazy!!!,"Freeway's voice may be intense but it all fits perfectly with the choruses, hooks and beats. Every song has good lyrics and gets a message across but the choruses can get a little weak (check ""hear the Song"") overall this cd is a good buy for anyone who enjoyed ""roc the mic""."
5,One of ma fav cds!,"This CD is awesome! Like every song is really good. There are really good beatz n rhymes on evry song, and has some guest appearennces from nelly, jay-z, snoop dogg, beainie sigel, faith evans and more.I would highly recomend this CD. The best songs are:What We DoAlrightOn My OwnFlipside (my favorite on the CDWe Get Around"
5,Freewizzle keeping it gizzle,"Yaknow Free was living up in my apartment complex, which is pretty nice place before his CD came out and I got the chance to roll with him for a good 4 months before I got evicted from all my parties. Case in point, hes a very good man, very determined down to earth and is AMAZING at flowing. He went for an hour once nonstop blunt after blunt just kept going. His album is gold and im sure hes gonna keep stepping up. Keep it up Free"
4,Great debut for the rapper Freeway,"If you have not bought this album yet, then you are wrong. Almost every track is hot, especially the track ""Flipside"". There are only a few decent albums that came out for the year 2003 so far. This is one of those albums"
2,I don't like his flows,"well put together cd, top quality. I guess you have to have a taste for his style...the only cut worth mentioning is track 8 with bennie seagle...but its nothing to spectial."
1,HORRIBLE SAVE YOUR MONEY...better yet buy another Nas CD,"I thought this was a Freeway album. Instead it's more like a complilation of a bunch of rappers to bolster this weak effort. This album reminds me of another terrible roc-a-fella debut and that's Cam. Way too many guest appearances. Every song but one features another rapper, singer or both. This usually occurs when A&R's feel that the artist (Free) can't hold his or the audiences attention for more than 16 bars. Oh and by the way, in rap music, you are supposed to be able to rhyme. That's a basic skill... apparently, Freeway hasn't mastered that one. FLAT OUT AWFUL!"
2,"great production, awful lyrics",this album if it wasn't for the dope beats and production would really only deserve a half a star. freeway's lyrics are about as generic and weak as they get. I totally agree with demetrius from tha bricks on his theory why so many guest appearances on this album. A label deep down knows they have a rapper(not a MC) who is incapable of holding an entire album down by himself so they try to get as many guest appearances on the album as they can. lyrically freeway is a midget in rap world full of midgets.if you like true MCs don't waste your money on this album.
5,Furniture Repair & Restoration,Awesome book! I had already done some refinishing so I new the basics but wanted to be able to do a more professional job. The book gave me helpful beginner information as well as took me to a much higher skill level. I like how it gives a difficulty level and a material list for each procedure. The only negative thing I can say is there are newer products and some listed can not be purchased anymore but you should expect that with the age of the book. You have to do your own research on the new products but that is also a great way to learn even more. Overall the knowledge I gained helped me and the book is a great reference because of the way it is set up. I can easily find and review just the section I need.
4,Great book somewhat not updated,The book is very detailed and explain each activity in great details with clear pictures.Some of the mentioned materials are not updated e.g. the recommended use of cloth diapers...
5,Nice book,Nice pictures with step by step instructions. I would highly recommend it to those looking to clean up some antique furniture.
2,not really listen-to-able,"Pretty stunning virtuoso playing here, just unaccompanied mandolin. Surely this guy is one of the greatest mandolin players in the world.But the problem is that it's so dazzling, it's hard to enjoy the songs. You just keep waiting for whatever crazy stunt he's gonna pull next.For much more enjoyable listening of mandolin music I'd go with Butch Baldassari's ""Mandolin Hymns"" or ""Mandolins from Italy."""
4,Book hits it right on,Some funny comments on America's most overrated University. A school of the past and the jokes roll on and point fun at the dolts of America who think like the person who posted above me.A good one reader though. Wouldn't read through it again.
1,Hated it! Author needs to get over inferiority problem!,"Mindless, childish attempt to deride the traditions and respect of this nation's oldest and most prestigious university. A shame."
3,Cute for outside of my son's play house,This is a cute little addition to put outside of a playhouse. I put our junk postcards in his mailbox & he is so excited when he gets mail. Regular sized mail does not fit in the opening but it's still fun for my son to pretend with.
4,"Cute, fun and simple","Since my little on recently recieved a playhouse from her grandparents, I thought it needed a mailbox so I purchased this for it. I really like Step2 products (I have the mailbox, house and picnic set) since they're made in the USA along with being safe and durable. My daughter loves playing with it and opens and closes the door and puts the flag up and down. Since it's all plastic we can leave it outside without worrying about it. The only thing to realize is that it's very light so it's easy to knock over or carry around for little ones. I decided to put some ballast in it so it wasn't as mobile and dumped some sand in it, which has worked pretty well.Overall a great addition to our play area."
4,Exactly what I thought it was,"This is exactly what I thought it would be. Heavy Duty, excellent construction. I wish it was a bit taller, but all in all a great toy!"
2,"door sticks, mailbox tips over","We are disappointed with this mailbox. The door is mounted so tightly that it is hard to open and close. Unless you brace the mailbox with one hand while working the door, the whole thing falls over. I have been trying to teach my son to brace the mailbox, but at 21 months, he still doesn't understand. He will not play with the mailbox. Occasionally, he will try again, but the thing falls over and he is disappointed--again.The size could be better. A postcard will barely fit in--with some bending at the edges. My son got postcards this summer from his nanny, and I wanted to ""mail"" them to him in this box, but it wouldn't really work.The name decal for the side is just a strip of white stick-on paper, and you have to write the name yourself with your own marker. I wish they had included a sheet of preprinted alphabet letters.Overall, I would NOT buy this again. It was a waste of money for us."
4,Fun but Too Small,"We got this for our 2 yo who was already excited about getting, opening and pretending to send mail. He really likes the mailbox and does play with it often. My only complaint is that it's not big enough to fit regular envelopes (we usually give him junk mail to play with). This is very frustrating for him when he tries to put something in and it won't fit, and a bit frustrating for me since I have to find small envelopes and postcards for him to use. Otherwise, seems to be fairly well made and sturdy; we liked the fact that it operates just like a real mailbox with the door and flag."
2,Would use a real mailbox instead.,I purchased this mailbox to go outside with my daughters playhouse. I knew that it would last outside because of it being Step 2. But we found that it was really small to hold letters and kept tipping over. So we invested in getting her a real mailbox. I would not by this again. It is good quality but not very sturdy.
5,Perfect toddler size,"Just right for our almost 2 year old daughter. She loves it. She puts rocks in it, Valentines,etc..Very durable to leave outside. She has hers placed outside right next to her playhouse. Very cute."
4,TRANTASIA: True Beauty,"I was very suprised and at times moved by this gem of a film. I thought it might be fluffy camp, but it has such a sweet heart to it. The girls are true beauties, both inside and out. Funny, touching and an interesting glimpse into a very unique subset of the LGBT community.What bravery to tell such a personal story! Brava to the girls and thank you for a great film."
2,"Interesting, kinda like a train wreck.","Aside from a couple contestants who seem more down to earth than the rest, this video is chock full of self absorbed people who seem like they are living in an out of touch fantasy world. This video could have been something good and important to the trans community. But instead it's more of a silicon pumped drag queen train wreck.The most comical and pathetic stories come from two of the african-american contestants. Both are incredibly narcistic and self centered. Even sadly blaming ""racism"" because they lost the pageant! Come on! You both stunk and that is the ONLY reason and you both know it!Buy it used and don't pay more than $5!"
5,Very funny... Very moving...,All my friends love this movie... saw it in a packed theater and the audience went crazy. The Girls are amazing with wonderful heartfelt stories. The film is very funny while also being very touching. Great!!!
4,A Humanizing Look at transsexuals,"This DVD introduces transsexuals as, first and foremost, people! That is something that many people need to see. For the ""plain vanilla"" people this will put a human face on the transsexual."
3,Good documentary,This DVD is a nice in-depth look at a few women and their life challenges. It's a good documentary and worth watching...
5,Brava Trantasia!,"I was very surprised and often moved by this gem of a film. I thought it might be fluffy camp, but it has such a sweet heart to it. The girls are true beauties, both inside and out. Funny, touching and an interesting glimpse into a very unique subset of the LGBT community. What bravery to tell such a personal story! Their life lessons should be required study. Brava to the girls and thank you for a great movie!"
2,Great book if you're in need of a good depression,"This story is well-told and well-written. Like an accident-scene gawker, I couldn't put it down when I read it back in September of 2000. Two years later, images from this book still haunt me, but I wish they didn't. If you like to read about highly dysfunctional people treating each other as badly as you can imagine, then you'll enjoy this one.How ironic that the author's first name is Merry! She's written a story sadder than a week's worth of the evening news."
3,pretty good,"It starts slowly and I kept waiting for a plot...but when the plot did finally emerge, it became a powerful story. Overall, very good."
5,A Hidden Gem,"I loved this book!It details the changing world of the late 60's in a way that I have not seen to date and is written in a gentle yet masterful voice . The closest I can come in comparison are the voices of J.D. Salinger's narrators in his descriptions of the world of the Glass family and of Holden Caulfield; unique, powerful, childlike and wise. Why this book is just now generating attention is something I do not understand, but I'm very glad it was recommended to me. I've already ordered her next book:""IF WISHES WERE HORSES.""I can't wait to read it."
2,CHECK OUT THE TYPO IN THE TITLE,"See the 2 images above I uploaded. There are exactly 8 pages of color plates of women's dresses and a couple gentlemen's suits. One the color pages reproduces the front cover so it's a waste. The most divine picture is on the back cover: a close-up of one of the highly-decorated women's gowns. Black & white photographs simply cannot express the grandeur and eloquence of design. The Russian ""style"" is completely lost in it. There is page after page of folk dresses, paintings, portraits, art objects...blah blah...they're just boring. The text must take a second seat to the images and it cannot replace them.Jackie Kennedy Onassis was about as stylish as you can get. And this book was published in 1976 so she somehow got around the Iron Curtain (which is ironic regarding the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis). Unfortunately, this book has not stood the test of time. I can't recommend it."
5,Behind the movie..,Good follow up to the movie and how it was made a little dry in verious areas but all in all a good book.
5,"To quote Darth Vader ""Impressive"".","This book provides a snap-shot of film-making at the end of the century. The story of Star Wars episode I's crafting in 150 pages. Packed with detail. Short quotes from people involved, from cast to crew, pepper the text adding colour and information. Well illustrated, clearly told and attention grabbing. Thorough in its scope and ecomomic in language, good reading and eminently collectible. A suitable companion to Thomas Smith's, Industrial Light and Magic: The Art of Special Effects (1986), which covered much on the special effects of episodes IV-VI. A contribution to the myth of Star Wars."
5,Wow! I'm surprised!,"When I bought this at my nearby spaceport, I've been looking and reading it ever sinse. I'm a BIG star wars fan, and have been fascinated by the story line! Well, I've got to go to Jupiter! Read it! it's out of this world!"
3,interesting but a little dissapointing,"As a star wars fan, I was interested in the making of this movie.. this book was interesting in that it contained interviews with some of the cast, and George Lucas, plus some on-the-set photographs, but the book has a canned, mass-market feel to it and does not go beyond the basic aspects of production."
5,Interesting and Informative,"This is a very infomative book, and lots of fun to read. Finding out how the movie was made and all the work that went into it, astounded me. Lots of nitty-gritty details and interviews with George Lucas, Rick McCallum, and other members of the crew and cast. The behind the scene pictures were also very intersting. I couldn't stop reading. A must have for any Star Wars fan."
4,Good solid book on the Making of TPM,"I love books about the making of movies and TV shows- esp. ones with special effects. While I have seen a few better Making of books, this one contained a lot of good information, beautiful photographs, and avoided gossip (a plus) to focus on the technical aspects of the production."
4,Great behind-the-scenes shots!,"This is really a nicely done book, with great pictures from filming. The book goes into great detail about design, especially sketches from Doug Chiang and other artists, and also focuses on all production aspects. The work done on this movie was amazing, and this book really documents it. A great read, and lots of fun!"
4,Very Haunting Documentary About the Manson Murders,"If you are a ""true crimes"" fan, then this film will be right up your alley. I learned a lot of things about the murders that I did not know and I came away from it being haunted by the profound evil of Manson and his followers. All-and-all, it was very well done."
3,Fairly entertaining,"If you're not already really interested in the whole Manson saga I can't see that you would find this video terribly interesting. No new info to be had, no theorizing or any such thing. Just a tour of the Family's and their victim's stomping grounds. One thing I found really interesting was seeing a picture of Shorty Shea's wife.I don't know. It's pretty cheap so if you collect books etc. related to the case I'd say it's worth buying. If you have only a passing interest and want to see some interesting films seek out the ""Manson"" documentary or ""Charles Manson Superstar"" instead."
3,focused on death tourism,This video focuses more on the death tourism aspects and all of the hollywood connections rather than on who Charlie was.
